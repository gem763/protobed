       "  'text': 'This momentous discovery was the beginning of a lot of trouble in neuroscience. Twenty years later, the American physiologist Benjamin Libet used the Bereitschaftspotential to make the case not only that the brain shows signs of a decision before a person acts, but that, incredibly, the brain’s wheels start turning before the person even consciously intends to do something. Suddenly, people’s choices—even a basic finger tap—appeared to be determined by something outside of their own perceived volition.\\n\\nAs a philosophical question, whether humans have control over their own actions had been fought over for centuries before Libet walked into a lab. But Libet introduced a genuine neurological argument against free will. His finding set off a new surge of debate in science and philosophy circles. And over time, the implications have been spun into cultural lore.\\n\\nToday, the notion that our brains make choices before we are even aware of them will now pop up in cocktail-party conversation or in a review of Black Mirror. It’s covered by mainstream journalism outlets, including This American Life, Radiolab, and this magazine. Libet’s work is frequently brought up by popular intellectuals such as Sam Harris and Yuval Noah Harari to argue that science has proved humans are not the authors of their actions.\\n\\nIt would be quite an achievement for a brain signal 100 times smaller than major brain waves to solve the problem of free will. But the story of the Bereitschaftspotential has one more twist: It might be something else entirely.\\n\\nThe Bereitschaftspotential was never meant to get entangled in free-will debates. If anything, it was pursued to show that the brain has a will of sorts. The two German scientists who discovered it, a young neurologist named Hans Helmut Kornhuber and his doctoral student Lüder Deecke, had grown frustrated with their era’s scientific approach to the brain as a passive machine that merely produces thoughts and actions in response to the outside world. Over lunch in 1964, the pair decided that they would figure out how the brain works to spontaneously generate an action. “Kornhuber and I believed in free will,” says Deecke, who is now 81 and lives in Vienna.\\n\\nTo pull off their experiment, the duo had to come up with tricks to circumvent limited technology. They had a state-of-the-art computer to measure their participants’ brain waves, but it worked only after it detected a finger tap. So to collect data on what happened in the brain beforehand, the two researchers realized that they could record their participants’ brain activity separately on tape, then play the reels backwards into the computer. This inventive technique, dubbed “reverse-averaging,” revealed the Bereitschaftspotential.\\n\\nThe discovery garnered widespread attention. The Nobel laureate John Eccles and the prominent philosopher of science Karl Popper compared the study’s ingenuity to Galileo’s use of sliding balls for uncovering the laws of motion of the universe. With a handful of electrodes and a tape recorder, Kornhuber and Deecke had begun to do the same for the brain.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Let\\'s not beat around the bush: the simple answer has to be yes; individual action is pointless.\\n\\nThink about it: what difference does one person forgoing a lamb chop for a lentil bake, deciding to catch the bus rather than take their car, or deciding not to jet off for that autumn getaway away in the Balearics make if the other 7,699,999,999 of us humans here on Earth don\\'t do anything?\\n\\nIt is a dispiriting conclusion and begs an obvious question, and one that I am sure has already occurred to you: why bother?\\n\\nThat\\'s exactly what I asked the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg when I met her last month. Rather than fly to her climate change meetings in New York, Greta had opted to be whisked across the Atlantic on a racing yacht.\\n\\nYou remember the boat, the one with the bright blue plastic poo bucket?\\n\\nImage caption Greta Thunberg with Justin Rowlatt\\n\\n\"The point\", she told me as we bobbed in Plymouth Sound, \"is to create an opinion. By stopping flying you don\\'t only reduce your own carbon footprint but also that sends a signal to other people around you that the climate crisis is a real thing and that helps push a political movement.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s a good answer, and, helps explain why this Swedish teenager with pigtails has captured the world\\'s attention.\\n\\nMy riposte was maybe a little rude: \"So you\\'re trying to make the rest of us feel guilty?\"\\n\\n\"No\", she replied calmly, and explained she doesn\\'t think it is her job to tell other people how to live their lives. Rather, her convictions must guide her own behaviour.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t fly because of the enormous climate impact of aviation per person.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Ms Thunberg sailed to New York on the Malizia II racing yacht...\\n\\nImage copyright AFP Image caption ...but some amenities were basic during the transatlantic journey\\n\\nShe acknowledges that she is a special case. \"Many people listen to what I have to say and I appear a lot in media so therefore I influence a lot of people and therefore I have a bigger responsibility because I have a bigger platform.\"\\n\\nPreviously, she\\'s tried attending conferences by video link but it just doesn\\'t make as much of an impression. \"I think it will have a bigger impact if I and many other young people are actually there\".\\n\\nAnd judging by the publicity she\\'s getting, she is right.\\n\\nBut let\\'s be honest, you\\'re no Greta Thunberg. Even if your choices do ripple out into the world and affect a few other people your decision to eat a little less meat and turn down the thermostat a notch isn\\'t the clarion call that is about to rally the world to the carbon cutting cause, is it?\\n\\nSo, why should individuals take action?\\n\\nThat is a question for a philosopher. It\\'s their job to wrestle with debates about what principles should guide our behaviour. And I\\'ve got just the man. Prof Peter Singer of Princeton University in the US has been described as \"the world\\'s most influential living philosopher\" by New Yorker magazine.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Vegan burgers such as these can provide an alternative to meat\\n\\nProf Singer describes himself as an expert in practical ethics and he is very clear on this question. He doesn\\'t just think we should all take action but argues there is a very strong moral obligation why we must do so.\\n\\n\"I think this is one of the great moral challenges of the 21st Century, perhaps the greatest moral challenge\", he says. \"If we are not acting we are endangering everyone who is alive now and also future generations.\"\\n\\nHe compares you failing to cut your emissions with you taking a bulldozer and razing the crops of a subsistence farmer in Africa. If you did that everyone would agree it was wrong, but the greenhouse gases you are responsible for have the same result, he argues.\\n\\nThe fact that the cause is invisible gases and that the effect may be felt in the distant future, doesn\\'t allow each and every one of us to escape the moral obligation to act, Prof Singer insists.\\n\\nThe reason is that our right to freedom of action doesn\\'t extend to harming others.\\n\\nHere\\'s another metaphor. Imagine there\\'s a speed limit on a busy shopping street and someone says \"I\\'m going to drive down there with my pedal to the metal, but don\\'t worry, there\\'s a good chance I won\\'t kill anyone.\"\\n\\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Climate change is projected to bring more extremes of weather\\n\\nYou wouldn\\'t say that\\'s fine, maintains Prof Singer. \"You\\'d say no, you don\\'t have any freedom or right to put other people in grave danger of being injured or killed. And that is exactly what we are doing by going ahead with the levels of greenhouse gas emissions we are emitting today.\"\\n\\nHe says the fact that each of us only plays a miniscule part in the process doesn\\'t make a jot of difference; the obligation on us all to act remains.\\n\\nI bet most of us instinctively recognise that there is real force in these arguments. So, why aren\\'t all of us doing more to cut our emissions already?\\n\\nTime for the insights of a behavioural psychologist. Step up Professor Kelly Fielding of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.\\n\\nWe are not the free-thinking independent spirits we imagine ourselves to be, says Prof Fielding.\\n\\n\"What we know as social psychologists is that people are very influenced by what others do, even though we don\\'t think we are\", she explains. \"It\\'s a paradox. We think we make our own decisions but the truth is we look to others for guidance about how we should behave.\"\\n\\nWhen it comes to climate change the problem is that we just aren\\'t getting the cues we need from our friends and families, or for that matter, from government and business, she says.\\n\\nHow years compare with the 20th Century average 2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months J F M A M J J A S O N D Source: NOAA Replay\\n\\nYet surveys show that people all over the world are getting increasingly worried about climate change.\\n\\nA US poll published in June illustrated the point very forcefully. The Reuters survey found that while 69% of Americans wanted the government to take \"aggressive\" action to combat climate change, only a third would be willing to pay an extra $100 to make it happen.\\n\\nWhat the respondents are saying is: \"Yes, there\\'s a problem, but it\\'s not my job to sort it.\"\\n\\nBut don\\'t despair, says Professor Fielding. The work of behavioural psychologists suggests It should be possible to flip these findings on their head.\\n\\nIf people need cues from others before they change their behaviour then all we need to do is get some people to start taking action and others will follow, she argues.\\n\\nWhich brings us full circle; all the way back to Greta Thunberg and that super-fast carbon-fibre yacht.\\n\\nAs Greta says, our actions are important not because they have a material effect on climate change, but because of the message they send to others.\\n\\nImage caption Ms Thunberg and other climate activists have been described as a \"threat\" to the oil industry\\n\\nWhat you do influences your friends and family and will help create the political space for governments and businesses to take action. That, in turn, is likely to encourage other people and other countries to do more.\\n\\nAnd it is happening already. Who would have thought that a company making meat-free burgers could be worth almost $4bn; that the world\\'s most powerful oil cartel would brand climate striking students the \"greatest threat\" to the oil industry; or that climate change would become the key issue for US Democratic presidential candidates?\\n\\nYes, what I am suggesting is the possibility of a virtuous circle. And yes, this is an argument for us all to be a lot more optimistic about what can be achieved.\\n\\nBecause there\\'s another crucial point to remember. Climate change isn\\'t binary, it doesn\\'t just happen or not happen. The crucial question for us all is how much climate change the world will experience.\\n\\nWe\\'ve already seen a degree of warming. The UN has urged us to try to stay below 1.5 degrees.\\n\\nSo here\\'s the thing: the more action we all take the less our climate will change and the more liveable the world will be for ourselves, our progeny and all the rest of the magnificent abundance that is life on earth.\\n\\nNow come on, that\\'s worth making a few lifestyle changes for isn\\'t it?',\n",

       "  'text': 'Maybe it was a coincidence. Maybe Dwayne Haskins was thinking about something else entirely Tuesday morning — that day’s lunch, perhaps? — when he tweeted one simple word from his Twitter account.\\n\\nBut more likely than not, the Redskins quarterback was reacting to the news that rookie Daniel Jones had just been named the New York Giants‘ starting quarterback, replacing Eli Manning three weeks into the season.\\n\\n“Sheesh,” Haskins tweeted, 12 minutes after the Giants‘ announcement.\\n\\nWith Jones set to start Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Duke product will become the third rookie quarterback to start under center in 2019 — joining Arizona’s Kyler Murray and Jacksonville’s Gardner Minshew. Haskins, though, will continue to have to wait his turn.\\n\\nDespite the Redskins being 0-2, quarterback Case Keenum has played well enough that Washington isn’t feeling any pressure to play Haskins.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the Redskins have set in motion a plan, so Haskins gets further development even with Keenum receiving most of the practice snaps. Besides Haskins acting as the scout team quarterback, the 22-year-old has worked closely with offensive assistant Matt Cavanaugh off to the side in practice.\\n\\n“Dwayne’s development does not stop,” offensive coordinator Kevin O’Connell said earlier this month. “It’s a minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, extra meetings in the mornings, extra meetings in the afternoon because he’s one snap away, so he has to prepare. … He’s got to be ready to go.”\\n\\nIf Haskins is frustrated by not starting, he hasn’t shown it. Since being drafted 15th overall in April, the Ohio State product has said all the right things about his role with the Redskins. Redskins coach Jay Gruden has described Haskins as not being fully ready, pointing to the fact the quarterback started just one year with the Buckeyes.\\n\\nThe Redskins’ approach with Haskins, too, isn’t out of the ordinary. Only 18 rookie quarterbacks have started from Week 1 of the regular season since 2010 — despite 117 signal-callers being drafted. Of those 18, 13 were taken in the first round. Thirty quarterbacks have been drafted in the first round this decade.\\n\\nEach circumstance that causes a quarterback to play can be different, as well. The Cardinals endorsed Murray, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner and the first overall pick, from the very start — trading away 2018 first-rounder Josh Rosen to the Miami Dolphins. Minshew, by comparison, started his first game in Week 2 after Nick Foles suffered a season-ending injury in the Jaguars’ opener.\\n\\nFor Jones, the Giants are turning to their rookie after the 38-year-old Manning struggled in two straight losses. The two-time Super Bowl winner threw two interceptions in last Sunday’s loss to the Buffalo Bills, and has looked like a shell of himself for years. Though the Jones pick was widely mocked — including with cameras catching Haskins shaking his head at the selection — the Giants are confident the quarterback can salvage their season.\\n\\nThe Redskins’ problems, on the other hand, have been mostly related to their lack of defense. In two games, Keenum has thrown for 601 yards, five touchdowns and has completed 69.1% of his passes with zero turnovers.\\n\\nTo most, Keenum has performed better than expected, quieting the immediate demand for Haskins.\\n\\n“He’s not taking many sacks, he’s getting out of the pocket, he’s making plays, and I love his competitiveness,” Gruden said. “I think that will rub off on the entire football team if it hasn’t already. Guys like to play for him and play with him.”\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters on Sept. 5, Haskins said he’ll be ready for his time, whenever the opportunity arises. He added he tries to get as much out of mental reps as he possibly can, standing behind Keenum and analyzing the reads on every play he’s not under center.\\n\\n“It’s either that or you don’t get better,” he said.\\n\\nAs for when Haskins might start, it depends on how the rest of the Redskins’ season unfolds. But looking at past situations, of the 30 first-round quarterbacks this decade, the average for their first start occurred in Week 4. Only one former first-rounder — Tennessee’s Jake Locker — went without starting a game his rookie season.\\n\\nThe Redskins, by the way, play Jones and the Giants in Week 4.\\n\\n“I have a lot of confidence in Dwayne right now, that if he goes in the game he can operate at a very high level,” O’Connell said.\\n\\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

       "  'text': 'It’s hard to fault either the intention or the emotion behind the fact-based legal drama Just Mercy, a sturdy retelling of one of the influential lawyer and social justice activist Bryan Stevenson’s most enraging cases. It’s also damn near impossible to fault the performances of Michael B Jordan as Stevenson and Jamie Foxx as his client, both as good as they’ve ever been. But instead it’s director Destin Daniel Cretton, whose breakout indie Short Term 12 showed such promise, who can’t quite rise to the material or his performers, choosing anonymity over ferocity, making the dullest, safest decision at every turn. It’s not enough to topple the fascinating true story at his film’s centre but it does have a frustrating, flattening effect.\\n\\nBryan Stevenson: the lawyer devoting his life to fighting injustice Read more\\n\\nStevenson, whose legend seems to rise with each year (most recently thanks to a HBO documentary), graduated from Harvard with a dream of making a difference. But unlike many of his peers, his idealism was focused on those at the very bottom of the food chain, death row inmates whom the system had deemed unworthy of due process. In the late 80s he started the Equal Justice Initiative to help right these wrongs and, in some cases, exonerate those who had been wrongly imprisoned.\\n\\nIn the film, he starts meeting prisoners and quickly discovers both the depth of the epidemic and his naïveté over how much he can really achieve. When he hears about Walter “Johnny D” Macmillan, a man who claims he’s been wrongfully accused of murder, he’s appalled and engaged in equal amounts, inserting himself into the case even if Macmillan remains unsure. As he delves further and starts to construct enough evidence for a retrial, he finds the system unwilling to bend for the truth.\\n\\nThe mechanics of the plot might be familiar but the facts of Macmillan’s case are so utterly infuriating that Stevenson’s dogged search for justice remains involving throughout. As he explains late in the film, the racial profiling that led local authorities to pin a violent murder on Macmillan was, and depressingly still is, indicative of a system that de-prioritises people of colour and people living in poorer communities. The case became a blueprint of sorts for Stevenson and given how the specifics don’t sound too dissimilar from cases 30 years on, there’s poignant prescience in its retelling. The facts make us angry enough and so Creton and co-writer Andrew Lanham’s decision to turn the film’s vile bigots, led up by a hammy Rafe Spall, into cartoonish villains snarling from the wings has a hindering effect. It distracts from the reality of the case and of ongoing cases such as this, turning racists into pantomime bad guys rather than presenting them far more chillingly as real people who have normalised their hatred.\\n\\nThe film is far more successful in its portrayal of the good guys. As the woman who helped Stevenson set up his non-profit, Brie Larson is solid but it’s the two men at the film’s centre who truly steal our attention. Jordan’s movie star credentials have been affirmed time and time again at this stage but it remains a joy to see him lead and here he dials back his trademark charm for a more understated turn that remains as effective as anything we’ve seen him do. Stevenson believed in fairness above all else and the scenes that cut deepest are when we see Jordan’s quiet outrage at how race tips the scale, for him and for those around him. His heroism is that much more effective because of the simplicity underpinning it and Jordan’s performance. He’s a man of the law who wants a just system, regardless of race and income, and it’s humbling and stirring to see him try to achieve this. Foxx hasn’t done much that’s memorable for so long now that it’s easy to forget just what an accomplished actor he is but he’s excellent here, avoiding an overly mannered character bit and delivering a powerfully restrained portrait of a man who just wants to go home.\\n\\nBoth performances could well enter the awards race but the film suffers from Creton’s workmanlike direction. The score, the cinematography, the film’s overall feel – it didn’t need to be this overwhelmingly average. I understand the need to allow the facts breathing space but still, a punchier, angrier, more confidently made film would have been possible without distracting from the truth.\\n\\nJust Mercy is a straightforward, no-frills drama that does have an undeniably emotive effect. The finale in particular, although it perhaps goes one big speech too far, is incredibly moving and the film’s epilogue reminds you that Stevenson’s brave, important work is sadly not over.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The indices have enjoyed a couple days of positive trading at the end of the month. Optimistic comments on China trade coupled with end of the month window dressing and allocations have pushed the indices to the top of the trading range that has existed since early August. This morning the S&P 500 hit overhead almost perfectly at the 50-day simple moving average and then reversed.\\n\\nThe market has done a particularly good job of keeping traders off balance as it went from looking like it would break the downside of the trading range to nearly breaking out to the upside.\\n\\nAccording to Investopedia, the DJIA has fallen an average of 0.8% during the month of September since 1950. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have not done slightly better but have on average lost 0.5% during the month.\\n\\nIt is important to keep in mind that seasonality is a tendency and not a certainty. There are many exceptions to the general rule but traders are aware of the tendency and can help to make it self-fulling.\\n\\nThe setup for this coming September is particularly ominous as the debate over China trade, Fed interest rate cuts and the potential for a recession has been reaching an extreme level. There has not been this much intense debate over the potential for a major macro-economic swing in a long time.\\n\\nMy best advice is to be aware of the potential landmines and stay highly reactive to potential changes in the price action. As we've seen this past week, it is very easy for overly aggressive bears to be caught leaning the wrong way.\\n\\nThe optimistic view is that a chaotic September would be a good setup for some great trading into the end of the year.\\n\\nI'm going to close out the month of August with about 70% cash, some smaller positions, and a few index shorts. I feel well prepared for the Ides of September.\",\n",
