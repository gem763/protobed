Beat Trump at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nLisa A., who was a Clinton voter, didn\u2019t think impeachment was a great idea, but said, \u201cI believe in the checks and balances,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not scared of the process.\u201d\n\nThe focus group was held in Mahoning Country, which Trump lost by less than 4,000 votes. Eight of the focus group participants swung from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, and three switched from Mitt Romney to Hillary Clinton.\n\nSix of the 11 participants say they have made up their minds for 2020 \u2014 four of the participants said they will definitely vote for Trump again, one former Trump voter said he will vote for Andrew Yang, and one Clinton voter, Lisa A., said she\u2019s leaning toward Elizabeth Warren.\n\nFive are undecided.\n\n\u201cWhile a focus group is not a statistically significant sample like a poll, these responses show how some voters are thinking and talking about the 2020 election in crucial counties,\u201d Axios\u2019s report said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Swing voters who took part in a focus group in Ohio, Youngstown, said impeachment is a distraction from the issues they care most about.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Democrat-Impeachment-Inquiry-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
