The wound turned ulcerous. Following compression, it took two years to heal.\n\n\"The compression dressing wore a hole in his left ankle which also turned ulcerous. The ulcers on his toes and ankles appeared over a weekend, sometime in 2014.\n\n\"My constituent applied for Disability Living Allowance in 2010. It was refused but on appeal he was granted middle rate care and high-rate mobility.\n\n\"At a review in 2013 he was taken off DLA but it was reinstated on appeal.\n\n\"At a review in 2016 he was taken off DLA but it was reinstated on appeal.\n\n\"At a review in 2019 he was refused PIP.\n\n\"He has been told that he must return his mobility car by 6pm on Sunday October 13 and I\u2019ve asked Motability if they will allow him to keep it while we try to resolve his case.\"\n\nSpeaking about the man's condition, the Birkenhead MP added: \"He likens the pain to being unable to step away from a gas fire after warming yourself.\n\n\"It is excruciating and constant.\n\n\"In February 2019, he was rushed into A&E with sepsis due to an infection, followed by two bouts of C-Difficile.\n\n\"Bedridden for two months, the ulcers gradually healed but were opened as soon as he began to walk about.\n\n\"Yet more feet the DWP believes are fit for walking.\"", "description": "WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES.
