I\u2019m not an actress,\u201d Chiu wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t even work in Hollywood anymore.

Harvey moved in: \u2018Please,\u2019 he told me, \u2018just one thrust, and it will all be over.\u2019\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Eventually, she wrote, she was able to \u201cwriggle off the bed and leave,\u201d because \u201cHarvey thought there would be another night to play the game and half the fun was the chase\u201d.\n\nWhile living with the alleged trauma for nearly two decades, Chiu wrote that she attempted suicide twice. She said she lived in \u201cconstant fear\u201d of Weinstein\u2019s \u201cabuse, control and power,\u201d suffering \u201ccompletely isolated from those around me.\u201d\n\nChiu spoke out for the first time publicly in the new book She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyer said Chiu\u2019s allegations are false and refuted other allegations in the book.\n\n\u201cThis book contains one-sided allegations without having adequately investigated the facts of each situation,\u201d wrote Donna Rotunno, adding that Weinstein and Chiu had \u201ca six-month physical relationship\u201d that was consensual.\n\nShe also said that Weinstein was now considering taking legal action against Chiu for breaking a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs mental health support or advice, you can contact Samaritans on 116 123 or www.samaritans.org .
