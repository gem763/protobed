I will give everything to help Arsenal win trophies and make the fans happy.'\n\nThose are the words of a proud Granit Xhaka on the day he joined Arsenal from Borussia Monchengladbach in May 2016.\n\nXhaka looked like he wanted to be anywhere but London, and specifically the Emirates Stadium, on Sunday.\n\nGranit Xhaka's outburst at fans on Sunday seemed like the point of no return at Arsenal\n\nXhaka appeared to swear at fans before taking his shirt off in disgust as he was substituted\n\nAnd as for making the fans happy, that seemed to be a lost cause for Arsenal's captain a long time ago.\n\nSunday's barely believable and hard-to-watch events all but confirm that is now likely to never happen.\n\nXhaka may be able to repair some of the damage, certainly with those who have sympathy for the Swiss midfielder and the at times over-the-top treatment he has received from his own supporters, but not all of it.\n\nBut Arsenal's supporters will never truly forget the day their captain tossed away the armband when he was subbed off, goaded them twice and told them where to go before tearing his shirt off in disgust just to cap things off, even though their provocation contributed significantly to the unsavoury incident.\n\nThis felt like the day things reached the point of no return.\n\nThere was so much hope when Xhaka first joined the club in a \u00a335m deal back in 2016\n\nThe midfielder rivalled Xabi Alonso in Germany but has not shown that form at Arsenal\n\nXHAKA'S CAREER STATS AT ARSENAL (All Competitions) Games: 144 Goals: 11 Assists: 17 Yellow Cards: 41 Red Cards: 2\n\nHow did it come to this? The starting point is Xhaka, 27, has not lived up to what Arsenal hoped he would be.\n\nHis \u00a335m price tag and the timing of the deal \u2013 completed in May 2016, just ten days after their season had finished \u2013 suggested this was someone Arsenal had to get through the door, whatever the cost, and quickly.\n\nHe talked himself up as aggressive and a leader while also earning a reputation that offered hope he could become Arsenal's midfield conductor, having rivalled the likes of then Bayern Munich's Xabi Alonso in his final season in Germany despite being just 23.\n\nBut Arsenal have not seen enough of his passing quality. Meanwhile they have seen more mistakes and moments of ill-discipline than they would have wished to.\n\nEven Xhaka had that 'oh no, not again' look on his face when his needless challenge gifted Spurs a penalty in September's North London derby.\n\nArsenal fans have seen more moments of ill-discipline from him than they would have liked to\n\nThe midfielder gave away a needless penalty during the north London derby in September\n\nSince joining Arsenal, no outfield player has made more errors leading to goals than him\n\nIt was the seventh error he had made leading to a goal since his arrival in England, two more than any other outfield player.\n\nXhaka's central role in terms of his position at the heart of the midfield centres the spotlight on him. The decision to make him captain has only sharpened that focus on the Swiss star further.\n\nAs Arsenal have scratched around in their attempts to restore former glories he increasingly become the scapegoat for their failing and target of the boo-boys.\n\nHis general unpopularity outside of the club, though, does not tally with how he is viewed inside it.\n\nThe decision to make him captain has only centred the spotlight on the Swiss star further\n\nXhaka is not a popular figure among fans but is well thought of in Arsenal's dressing room\n\nThe midfielder looks dejected after Arsenal's defeat in last season's Europa League final\n\nHis teammates voted for him to be captain and some were visibly shocked by the animosity towards him at the Emirates on Sunday.\n\nAnd none of Xhaka or Arsenal's shortcomings excuse the level of vitriol he has received.\n\nIn the flesh and online, professional and personal, aimed at him and even some members of his family, sometimes in small numbers sometimes huge, like the best part of 60,000 on Sunday.\n\nSome of it has even extended to death threats. No wonder he snapped.\n\nHector Bellerin took to social media to offer support to Xhaka and make a plea to the fans\n\nArsenal manager Unai Emery is now left with a real mess of a situation to sort out\n\nTo do what he did comes with consequences he will now have to face but footballers are not robots so that he reacted is understandable.\n\n'We are all humans, we all have emotions and sometimes it's not easy dealing with them,' Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin said in a Twitter post on Monday morning.\n\n'It's time to lift each other up, not to push each other away. We only win when we are together.'\n\nThat message may have come too late in Xhaka's case and has left Unai Emery with a real mess of a situation to sort out.", "description": "ADRIAN KAJUMBA: Arsenal fans will never truly forget the day Xhaka tossed away the armband when he was subbed off and told them where to go.
