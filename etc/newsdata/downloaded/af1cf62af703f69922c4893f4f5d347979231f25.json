However, former Prime Minister and economist Dr Manmohan Singh thinks the Indian economy won't reach this target as the growth rate is \"declining year after year\".\n\nBCCL\n\n\"I have said this publicly before that to reach a goal of five trillion dollar by 2024, as against 2.7 trillion dollar that we had in 2018, would require a growth rate of 10-12 per cent per annum. What is happening in BJP regime is that the government is faced with prospect of a declining rate of growth year after year,\" Singh said.\n\n\"IMF (International Monetary Fund) has come with statement that India's growth rate during the current fiscal year will be only 6.1 per cent as against 7.3 per cent mentioned some months ago. With growth rate declining year after year, I don't think there is any hope of economy reaching the target of five trillion dollars by 2024,\" he added.\n\nBCCL\n\nDon't Miss 485 SHARES 2.8 K SHARES 14.4 K SHARES 1.1 K SHARES\n\nLast month, Singh had stressed the need for adopting a \"well-conceived national strategy to make India a five trillion dollar economy\".\n\nSingh had said, \"Presently our country seems to have slowed down somewhat.
