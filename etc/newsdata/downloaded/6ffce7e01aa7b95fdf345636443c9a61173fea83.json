The objects date from around 900 to 800 B.C.\n\nFound within an ancient square enclosure on the northern edge of the River Thames, the weapons, which include sword fragments, are all either partially broken or damaged.\n\n\u201cThe deliberate placement of these items may suggest a specialist metal worker operated in this area, and this large scale deposit of bronze may represent an accumulation of material akin to a vault, recycling bank or exchange,\u201d explained Historic England in its statement. \u201cCould this treasure have been a religious offering, were they hoping to recycle the metal, control access to the material, or was it merely a rejection of bronze tools that were becoming outdated with the emergence of iron technology?\u201d\n\nELEPHANT MAN\u2019S UNMARKED GRAVE DISCOVERED IN THE SAME CEMETERY AS JACK THE RIPPER VICTIMS\n\nDubbed \u201cthe Havering Hoard\u201d after the area where the ancient objects were found, the items will go on display at the Museum of London Docklands in April 2020.

The skeletons of a woman and child, for example, were recently discovered in the Tower of London, the first skeletons found at the famous historic site in 50 years.\n\nThe long-lost remains of Captain Matthew Flinders, the explorer credited with giving Australia its name, were discovered near a London railway station earlier this year.
