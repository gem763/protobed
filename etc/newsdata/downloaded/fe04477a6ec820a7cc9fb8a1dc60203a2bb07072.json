I tried to ignore it but it was really starting to creep me out,\u201d Maritza told Yahoo Style UK.\n\n\u201cMy husband, Corey, was working that night so I was even more freaked out. I sent the picture to him, my mom and best friend - they all had different opinions.\u201d\n\nMaritza posted the image containing the spooky \"apparition\" on Facebook, where it was shared hundreds of thousands of times (Maritza Cibuls/Supplied) More\n\n\n\n\n\nMaritza snuck into the room with a torch while her son was still sleeping to try and catch a glimpse of the \u201cghost\u201d.\n\n\u201cI tried to be as quiet as possible and hide the light from my flashlight as much as I could,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything unusual in the crib at all. I was trying to feel around to see if there was any wetness - we thought there might be some drool on the sheet - but I didn\u2019t feel any.\n\n\u201cI told myself maybe it was just a stain on the sheet and left the room. I probably went in there about three more times throughout the night,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more: Mum\u2019s baby name \u2018possibly illegal\u2019\n\nMaritza just couldn\u2019t sleep or relax without understanding what the strange apparition was.\n\nShe recalled: \u201cSome part of me does believe in ghosts...but I just tried to tell myself there was some logical explanation.\u201d\n\nThe mum, who also has a two-year-old daughter, spent the night with the baby monitor pressed against her face, with the full volume and brightness turned all the way up.\n\n\u201cI kept opening my eyes to check to make sure the \u201cghost\u201d wasn\u2019t moving. Then when I would start to finally relax, my son would roll over and I\u2019d be on high alert again. Every time I checked on him, though, he seemed completely fine,\u201d she said.\n\nThe next morning her mind was finally put at ease when she realised exactly what had happened after going into the room, opening the blinds and checking the mattress in the cot.\n\n\u201cImmediately, it was so obvious there was something underneath the sheet. I pulled the sheet off and saw a giant baby face printed on the sticker,\u201d she revealed.\n\nThe source of the spooky face soon became apparent when she pulled back the sheet the next day (Maritza Cibuls/Supplied) More\n\nMaritza had never seen the sticker through the sheet before because she had always used a mattress protector.", "description": "A mum spent all night staring at her son's baby monitor after spotting a 'ghost face' next to him in his cot", "authors": ["Yahoo Style Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Uxqjdyi3UTk_PK_.MQurDg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3d2622b0-f3f4-11e9-afef-9fe4b7aeb0a2", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
