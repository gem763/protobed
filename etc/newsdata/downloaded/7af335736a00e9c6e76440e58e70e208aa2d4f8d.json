The ECB is expected to take monetary action at today\u2019s meeting to give a boost to the depressed Eurozone economy as a result of the rising global trade tensions, slower growth, and Brexit uncertainties. The ECB could lower its deposit rate by ten basis points to -0.50 %, announced a new round of asset purchases up to 50 billion euros per month over at least a year and put in place a system aiming to exempt a third of banks\u2019 excess reserves from the deposit rate. It is obvious that the market has highly dovish expectations from Mario Draghi. But high expectations also mean easy disappointment. Hence the euro\u2019s mood will mostly depend on how investors react to a more or less dovish decision at today\u2019s ECB meeting.\n\n\n\nThe euro bears have begun flirting with the 1.10 mark against the US dollar on Wednesday\u2019s session. A sufficiently dovish ECB decision could send the EURUSD sustainably below this level. But if the ECB fails to meet investors\u2019 expectations, buyers will be happy to step in at two-year lows. Put options trail below 1.1040 at today\u2019s expiry. Investors are hedged against a move below the most-watched 1.10 mark, but the contrary is not true. On the topside, a move above 1.1110, the two-month down-trending channel top, could push for a broader euro correction.\n\n\n\nThe single currency pared half of the gains accumulated between May and August against the British pound. The temporary no no-deal Brexit relief across the sterling markets should encourage a deeper correction toward 0.8845, the 200-day moving average.\n\n\n\nCable consolidates a touch above the 1.23 mark on easing no-deal Brexit worries. The future remains uncertain for Britain, however. An early general election and a possible Tory defeat could mean a further confusion regarding the country\u2019s willingness and ability to leave the European Union. For now, avoiding a no-deal Brexit by October 31st is the only silver lining for the pound, in the presence of a furious Prime Minister and a silenced Parliament as the clock ticks louder before the October 19 summit with the Europeans.\n\n\n\nBut the British blue chips do just fine with a cheapened sterling. The FTSE 100 (+0.96%) extended gains in a broadly risk-on session on Wednesday, although the energy stocks lagged (-0.64%) on a sudden reversal of the recovery in oil prices. The unexpected rise in US oil inventories last week put buyers on the back foot. Talks of improved diplomatic relations between the US and Iran after Bolton\u2019s departure further weighed on the investor sentiment ahead of today\u2019s OPEX+ meeting in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\nDespite a weak appetite in energy stocks, the FTSE futures (+0.52%) hint at a positive start in London.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, US President Donald Trump delayed the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports from October 1st to October 15th. The yuan gained, as Asian equities and US futures edged higher on nourished hope that some progress could be made at the trade talks scheduled in early October between the US and Chinese officials. But the chances of a deal remain slim due to looming controversies on subjects that matter to both parties, such as intellectual property, data privacy, and security issues. The next round of tariffs will likely hit more Chinese goods by mid-October.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, stocks in Hong Kong missed today\u2019s rally, as HKEX gapped 3% lower at the open on talks that the LSE may reject its buy offer citing political and regulatory risks at a time when Hong Kong struggles with increasing China-related tensions. LSE may prefer focusing on Refinitiv takeover, Reuter\u2019s former financial and risk unit, to seek value through stretched financial data and analysis. LSE stock is up by 90% since January. A downside correction to 7000p could be expected over the next twelve months.\n\n\n\nTurkey to ease further.\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) is also expected to lower its interest rates at today\u2019s monetary policy meeting. The unorthodox bias across the major central banks such as the Fed and the ECB, combined with the recent current account surplus, tamed inflation pressures and President Erdogan\u2019s explicit demand for single-digit interest rates should encourage the new CBRT head to shred the interest rates indulgently by another 300 basis points, or more.\n\n\n\nIn July, the muted market reaction had surprised more than the generous 425-basis-point cut below the psychological 20% level. Interestingly, there is no visible stress regarding another CBRT rate cut in the currency markets. The USDTRY trades comfortably below its 100-day moving average (5.80). Hence, carry traders could be ready to take another hit on the rates unless a less dovish action from the ECB pushes the carry spread to fresh yearly lows.\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nto open 32 points higher at 7370\n\n\n\nto open 65 points higher at 12424\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest, and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
