There would be no token player or just a headline-grabbing player.\n\n'So, whoever it may be, you go mention the five highest-profile rugby players - league or union - around the world and we'd be interested and our club would get those.\n\n'David Argyle will resource each one of those signings.'\n\nWilliams is taken down by two South African tacklers during New Zealand's opening win\n\nThe Wolfpack spent heavily on recruitment following the appointment of former Leeds boss McDermott 12 months ago and director of rugby Brian Noble says the plan is to keep 90 per cent of the players that helped gain promotion.\n\nMcDermott says the club have already identified key targets and will aim to finalise deals ahead of the start of pre-season training on November 10.\n\n'We need at least four players - somebody in the front row, an outside back, a back row and someone around the ruck area - and there are four players there that we've identified,' he added.\n\n'We've been on with recruitment all year but the reality is those people we were speaking to weren't sure whether we would be in Super League or not so we'll be having more solid conversations now.'\n\nToronto Wolfpack celebrate their promotion to the Super League by beating Featherstone\n\nToronto realised their five-year plan to reach Super League with two years to spare and McDermott says the priority in 2020 will be to avoid relegation.\n\n'The reality is we want to survive first,' he said. 'You look at what London Broncos did this year, which I thought was extremely good and they won a load of games, but the dynamic was that everybody around them won a lot of games as well so they ultimately ended up getting relegated.\n\n'So survival for sure is the reality of what we've got to do but quietly look a bit further towards the top end than the bottom end.'\n\nMcDermott was appearing at a press conference in Manchester to announce the UK launch of online sales for 'Rugby Strength', the team's CBD-infused body topical range.\n\nThe Wolfpack are the first professional sports team in the world to enter the hemp-CBD infused products marketplace.", "description": "The Canadian outfit are on the lookout for big-name signings following their promotion from the Championship and intend to follow up on their initial approach once his Rugby World Cup is over.", "authors": ["Ian Laybourn", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19546988-0-image-a-41_1570722057349.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
