By the time I arrived at Ayluardo\u2019s, a family-owned restaurant in the Iztapalapa neighbourhood, beads of sweat had formed along my hairline, and I was starving.\n\nI checked the menu \u2013 damp and crinkled around the edges \u2013 and saw Central Mexico\u2019s usual fare staring back at me: enchiladas drenched in spicy tomato sauce; cheese-stuffed poblano chillies topped with pomegranate seeds; and chargrilled meats served with fresh guacamole and refried beans.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I turned to the back page in search of my favourite agua fresca (water blended with fruit) that I spotted something unusual. Three platillos ancestrales (ancestral plates) lay hidden among the drinks as if cast out from the main menu: sopes del comal con chapulines (toasted grasshoppers served on a thick, doughy tortilla); conejo (rabbit); and tortitas capeadas de ahuautle en salsa verde. I was familiar with the first two; grasshopper snacks and slow-cooked rabbit can be found across the country, particularly in Central and Southern Mexico. But despite having lived in Mexico for six months at the time, I\u2019d never heard of the last one.\n\nIntrigued, I asked the waiter what \u201cahuautle\u201d is.\n\n\u201cInsect eggs, se\u00f1orita,\u201d he replied, explaining that they were mixed into a batter, fried and topped with green salsa. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special dish that goes back many, many years. Shall I place the order?\u201d\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 A sauce made from flying ants\n\n\u2022 Japan\u2019s mysterious moving meal\n\n\u2022 The truth about a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls\n\nLaid by water flies from the Corixidae and Notonectidae families (though often referred to as \u201cmosquitos\u201d by locals), ahuautle is a delicacy that pre-dates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico. Loosely translating to \u201cseeds of joy\u201d from Nahuatl, the ancient Aztec language, these precious quinoa-sized eggs were considered by the Aztecs to be the food of the gods. Believing the eggs would give them strength, Aztec emperors \u2013 including, most famously, Montezuma \u2013 were said to have eaten ahuautle every morning during the summer rainy season, when the eggs were in abundance and at their freshest.\n\nMexico City locals will tell you that ahuautle also took centre stage at the human sacrifice ceremonies held in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n (which now forms part of modern-day Mexico City) for Xiuhtecuhtli, the Aztec god of fire, every 52 years (an Aztec century). According to 16th-Century Spanish chronicles, after the victims\u2019 hearts had been removed, the empty chest cavity would be coated in the insect eggs as an offering to Xiuhtecuhtli. The gold-coloured eggs were considered so sacred that the sixth Aztec emperor of Tenochtitl\u00e1n (the father of Montezuma) was named Axay\u00e1catl after the type of water fly that lays them.\n\nAxay\u00e1catl aren\u2019t the only insects revered by Mexico\u2019s ancient civilisations. According to researcher and insect specialist Julieta Ramos Elorduy B, author of \u00bfLos insectos se comen? (Can you eat insects?), the Maya referred to grasshoppers as \u201clas divinas flores de dios\u201d (the divine flowers of god), while the Huichol believed wasps carried people\u2019s souls into the afterlife. Among the Teotihuacanos, the Papilio butterfly was a symbol of beauty and youth. It was only when the Spanish conquistadors arrived \u2013 repulsed, among other things, at their subjects\u2019 affinity for insects \u2013 that Mexico\u2019s love of bugs began to wane.\n\nPerhaps noticing my slight hesitation, the waiter quickly asked: \u201cWould you like to see how they\u2019re prepared?\u201d\n\nBefore I could accept, he signalled me to follow him to the kitchen. I shuffled past a sea of lime-green tablecloths and daffodil-yellow chairs, almost every one of which was taken up by the afternoon rush of Mexican families enjoying feasts of grilled meats, vegetable soups and corn tortillas. Inside the cramped, dimly lit kitchen, I was greeted by head chef and restaurant co-owner, Beatriz Ayluardo.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get many ahuautle orders these days,\u201d she said, as she showed me a plastic container filled with thousands of sun-dried Axay\u00e1catl eggs, each no bigger than a grain of sand. \u201cIt\u2019s more expensive than our other dishes, and not many people know about it.\u201d\n\nAs I looked on, she mixed the ahuautle with milk, eggs, breadcrumbs, finely chopped onion and coriander to make a runny pancake batter, and then dropped tennis ball-sized portions into a pan of sizzling oil.\n\n\u201cThis recipe was passed down to us from my husband\u2019s mother,\u201d Ayluardo explained, as she flipped the insect-egg pancakes at lightning speed. \u201cShe was very passionate and knowledgeable about ancestral ingredients like ahuautle. She would make them at home and tell us stories about how they were once eaten by emperors and gods.\u201d\n\nWhile she prepared a sauce from garlic, tomatillos and serrano chillies to accompany the pancakes, she continued: \u201cWhen we inherited the family business, we wanted to honour the recipe my mother-in-law had taught us, as well as promote the culinary culture we inherited from [the Aztecs]. But it hasn\u2019t been easy.\u201d\n\nAhuautle cultivators use the same insect-farming techniques as the Aztecs employed on the banks of Lake Texcoco hundreds of years ago before the lake was largely drained and Mexico City was built in its place. Farmers place hand-woven reed nets just under the water\u2019s surface and secure them with sticks and rope. They leave the nets floating for up to three weeks, during which time the Axay\u00e1catl flies will lay thousands of their eggs atop the tightly woven reed bundles. To extract the eggs from the lake, cultivators simply lift the nets from the water and lay them out in the sun to dry. Once all the moisture is gone, a sand-like pile of eggs remains.\n\nSimilar to the harvesting of other edible insects such as grasshoppers, ants and mealworms, ahuautle farming requires far less water, land and energy than the rearing of cattle. Yet the tiny eggs fetch a much higher price. According to Ayluardo, a small jar of ahuautle starts at 400 Mexican pesos, or around \u00a316.50, compared to around 100 Mexican pesos (\u00a34) you\u2019d pay for a kilo of beef.\n\nIt\u2019s a very special dish that goes back many, many years\n\nBecause of its high cost, ahuautle has been dubbed by local restaurateurs like Ayluardo as \u201cthe caviar of Mexico\u201d. But, unlike the famous wild sturgeon roe found in the Caspian and Black seas, ahuautle\u2019s steep price tag isn\u2019t due to its popularity. Rather, it\u2019s because ahuautle is extremely hard to get hold of. Due to a drop in cultivators and vendors, ahuautle has become increasingly rare (particularly out of rainy season), and often has to be ordered weeks in advance. Mexico City\u2019s water shortage means the region\u2019s Axay\u00e1catl population is declining, and could disappear altogether.\n\n\u201cFor the last 20 years, we\u2019ve had a reliable source of ahuautle thanks to a man called Don Manuel Flores, one of the last ahuautle sellers in Mexico City,\u201d Ayluardo said as she plated my pancakes. \u201cHe\u2019s in his late 70s and partially blind, but he still made his rounds through Iztapalapa, leaning on his cane, shouting \u2018ahuautle!\u2019 every weekend. Like us, he felt passionate about not allowing this ancient caviar to die.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ayluardo told me it\u2019s been several weeks since Don Manuel had last stopped by the restaurant. \u201cHe isn\u2019t well,\u201d she said sadly, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure when, or if, he\u2019ll return.\u201d\n\nWith none of Don Manuel\u2019s children or grandchildren interested in taking up the position, his absence is felt heavily at Ayluardo\u2019s restaurant.\n\n\u201cWe may be able to find the eggs in the San Juan or La Merced markets during the rainy season,\u201d Ayluardo said, \u201cbut it will be even more difficult and expensive to source them. The saddest part is that we may never hear \u2018ahuautle\u2019 ring through the streets of Iztalpalapa again, and that\u2019s very worrying for the future of an already forgotten ingredient.\u201d\n\nAhuautle isn't the only insect dish at risk of disappearing. According to Elorduy B, despite Mexico having one of the largest entomophagous cultures in the world (Mexicans consume 531 of the planet\u2019s 2,111 recorded edible insects), the country is losing its appetite for bugs. In her book, Elorduy B warns that this could threaten a culinary culture that has been practiced here for hundreds \u2013 perhaps thousands \u2013 of years. Not only that, but a rejection of entomophagy also puts further pressure on water- and land-intensive animal agriculture, which, with a world population set to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, may not be sustainable forever.\n\nAyluardo held out the ahuautle pancakes \u2013 now lightly browned and bathed in the moss-green sauce \u2013 for me to try. I took a bite, first noticing the tangy, spicy hit from the salsa and the slightly gritty texture from the eggs laced through the spongy batter. Then, the distinctive flavour of the ahuautle hit me: a potent, fishy taste similar to that of the tiny dried shrimp popular in East Asian cuisine.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly an acquired taste, but with a 63.8% protein content (most lean, cooked beef has just 26-27%) and requiring only a fraction of the resources used to cultivate the flame-grilled steak on the neighbouring table, it was a taste I could get behind.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
