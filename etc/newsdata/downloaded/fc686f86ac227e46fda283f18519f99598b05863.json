According to White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, American forces \u201cwill not support or be involved in the operation\u201d and will \u201cno longer be in the immediate area.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appears to be acting on his demand that a \u201csafe zone\u201d be established along the Turkish-Syrian border in order to return over 1 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey. The White House did not give a timeframe for the anticipated invasion.\n\nThe administration also did not mention its policy toward Kurdish armed groups like the Syrian Democratic Forces stationed in northern Syria, suggesting that the major American ally in the ground fight against ISIS will be left to fend for their own. Turkey has long considered Kurdish fighters to be terrorist groups, as they pursue autonomy and an independent Kurdistan in the region. As the Guardian notes, \u201cSyria experts warned that the US abandonment of the SDF would lead to another, new front in the eight-year Syrian conflict, and could push the Kurds into seeking an arrangement with the Assad regime in Damascus.\u201d\n\nThe move was immediately criticized by Democrats like Ruben Gallego, an Iraq veteran and congressman from Arizona: \u201cAllowing Turkey to move into northern Syria is one of the most destabilizing moves we can do in the Middle East. The Kurds will never trust America again. They will look for new alliances or independence to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nThe maneuver will certainly be condemned for its optics. As Ragip Soylu, Turkey correspondent for Middle East Eye, tweeted: \u201cThis is the third time Trump decided to pull US forces from Syria after a phone call with Erdogan,\u201d with U.S. troop withdrawals announced in April and December 2018. And, yet again, there appears to be a possible Trump-world conflict of interest in the relationship between the president and Erdogan:\n\nWhat could explain Trump's green-lighting a Turkish invasion of Iraq and assault on US Kurdish allies? \ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/zrSeasBU34 \u2014 Peter Gleick (@PeterGleick) October 7, 2019", "description": "The White House announced that Turkey is preparing to invade northern Syria, where the United States currently has around 1,000 troops.
