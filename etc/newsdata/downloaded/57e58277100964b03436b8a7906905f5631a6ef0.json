Under the previous leadership, the Women\u2019s March was regularly under fire over its ties to anti-Semitic groups and comments deemed anti-Semitic.\n\nLINDA SARSOUR GETS BACKLASH FOR 'JESUS' WAS PALESTINIAN' TWEET\n\nBland previously shared a post that appeared to point fingers at the \u201cAmerican Jewish Establishment\u201d after the March 15 attacks on two New Zealand mosques that killed more than 50 people. Bland later apologized, clarifying that she would extend blame \u201cto all establishment politicians of both parties, of any or no faith,\u201d the Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nMallory has faced backlash after she said this past January that controversial Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan was the \u201cgreatest of all time because of what he\u2019s done in black communities.\u201d She had been seen attending an event where Farrakhan said that \u201cthe powerful Jew is my enemy.\u201d\n\nMallory later wrote, \u201cAs I continue to grow and learn as both an activist and as a woman, I will continue to grapple with the complicated nature of working across ideological lines and the question of how to do so without causing harm to vulnerable people.\u201d\n\nSarsour has come under fire for lauding Farrakhan, objecting to the Jewish right to return to Israel, and even calling for \u201cjihad\u201d against President Trump in 2017. She later claimed she was calling only for nonviolent dissent.\n\nCo-chair Carmen Perez will remain with the organization, the paper reported, despite calls for her resignation last year.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe new board members, elected by a nominating committee, included three Jewish women, a transgender woman, a former legislator, two religious leaders and a member of the Lakota nation\u2019s Oglala tribe, the Post reported.\n\nThe Women\u2019s March, which was first held on Jan. 21, 2017, was a response to President Trump\u2019s White House inauguration. Thousands of women in Washington, D.C., and in cities across the U.S. and world, used the day to advocate for human rights and women's issues, which protesters argued would face adversity under the new administration.\n\nFox News' Madeline Farber, Luka Mikelionis and Caleb Parke contributed to this report.", "description": "The Women\u2019s March\u00a0reportedly severed ties with three of its founding board members Sunday following controversies that have\u00a0included\u00a0accusations of anti-Semitic\u00a0rhetoric weakening\u00a0the group's mission.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Womens-March-GettyImages-1085372922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
