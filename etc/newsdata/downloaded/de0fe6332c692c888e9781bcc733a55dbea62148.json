And wait till you see the spa \u2013 we offer the latest treatments using award-winning products.\u201d\n\nI can see that she gets treated exactly the way she would at home: like royalty. She always comes back perfectly groomed\n\nTempted to check-in? Well, I am afraid you can\u2019t \u2013 unless you are a cat. This retreat, with rooms from \u00a320 a night, is purely for felines, especially those with a taste for the finer things in life. Lawlor Cat hotel, which opened in 2016, has 23 suites, all of which are booked out months in advance by cats such as Vaishti, a persian chinchilla who has stayed five times in the past year, using the hotel\u2019s \u00a34-a-mile chauffeur service to and from her home in north London. \u201cShe listens to Andrea Bocelli during the journey. She melts when he sings and it keeps her calm,\u201d says her owner, Barry Lobel, 40, a tech company CEO. \u201cOnce she\u2019s there, I can log into the hotel\u2019s CCTV and see that she gets treated exactly the way she would at home: like royalty. She always comes back perfectly groomed and rested.\u201d\n\nEric and Lenny, two rescue cats from Epping, also stay regularly and enjoy reiki therapy, watching cat-and-mice DVDs in the lobby and being read to. \u201cAfter an awful experience with a cat sitter, when Eric went missing and eventually came back emaciated, my husband and I found the hotel online. Now we\u2019ll only go on holiday if there\u2019s availability,\u201d says their owner, Sarah Waite. \u201cJane and her team understand the responsibility of looking after \u2018our children\u2019 \u2013 whatever Eric and Lenny want, they get. We\u2019ve just had artificial grass put down in our garden and have asked if they can have it in the living room \u2013 they love it.\u201d The cats have asked? She laughs: \u201cThat\u2019s how I talk about my boys!\u201d The spoiling doesn\u2019t stop there: at home, the cats are fed a 100% organic diet, made up of 75% fresh fish and meat. Although their last vet bill came to \u00a3800, Waite says she would \u201cpay anything to give them the best life\u201d.\n\nFrom food to fashion, holidays to healthcare, pets have never been so pampered, their care so aligned with what would be considered luxurious by human standards. A booming industry has emerged to meet the demands of their anthropomorphising owners. According to Mintel research, the value of pet-care products and services in the UK will reach \u00a32.1bn by 2023 \u2013 a 25% increase from an estimated \u00a31.7bn in 2018. Thanks to increasing pet ownership (40% of households have pets, according to the Pet Food Manufacturers Association), a new market in pet tech is thriving, offering wearable activity monitors and GPS trackers that allow owners to keep an eye on their pet\u2019s sleep, activity and calorie-burn. Meanwhile, smart enclosures (such as the \u00a3550 ZenCrate) will detect when a \u201cstressed\u201d animal enters, and play calming music or activate fans. Pet treats are evolving into indulgences close to human ones, from doggie facials to pet brunch.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018We\u2019re so in tune with how we look after our own wellbeing, it\u2019s definitely rubbing off on our pets.\u2019 Photograph: Alex Grace/The Guardian\n\n\u201cPets give uncritical, unconditional love and comfort \u2013 and in difficult times, we project human qualities and emotions on to animals, to make ourselves feel better and less isolated,\u201d says Corinne Sweet, a British psychotherapist and author of The Anxiety Journal. As the number of one-person households increases (the Office for National Statistics estimates that 26% of people in England will live alone by 2041), and more people work from home, pets are a powerful antidote to loneliness. \u201cWhile the relationship between human and animal goes back to the beginning of time, the modern phenomenon of treating them like \u2018mini-mes\u2019 shows just how stressed or alone many of us feel.\u201d\n\nIs there any human activity a pet now can\u2019t muscle in on? In the US \u201cbark mitzvah\u201d ceremonies, catered for by specialist bakeries, are popular, while some companies offer between 10 hours and a week\u2019s paid \u201cpawternity leave\u201d for new pet owners. Ikea\u2019s pet range currently features a sofa bed that can extend for \u201cpuppy sleepovers\u201d, while upmarket labels such as MiaCara sell minimalist pet furniture (Letto day bed, \u00a3797), alongside adventure products such as doggie sleeping bags and hiking boots.\n\nOn Amazon, sales of memory foam pet beds are up 107% year on year, while doggy beer and ros\u00e9 wine gift sets are up 260%. \u201cPet owners want to have more shared experiences with their pets,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson says. \u201cThat might be at-home spa pampering days, snacking during movie night (Petface\u2019s Dog Deli chicken popcorn), joining the toast at their next celebration (Woof&Brew\u2019s pawsecco freeze pops), or tucking into brunch with breakfast-specific pet food that includes yoghurt, berries and seeds (Lily\u2019s Kitchen Breakfast Crunch).\u201d\n\nPrudence, a bull terrier, and Mr Binks, a rescue dog, both enjoy social outings such as doggy brunch and doggy cinema, at which they get their own seat, blanket and ice-cream. \u201cI like taking them to different places for mental stimulation \u2013 I perish the thought that they would ever be bored,\u201d says their owner, Anna Webb, a broadcaster and dog trainer. \u201cThey get the latest toys and their outfits range from practical, outdoors-weather clothing to dressing-up costumes and cashmere sweaters. Their bedding is a mix of hemp blankets and plush faux fur.\u201d Not that they sleep in their beds: they share Webb\u2019s, with Prudence mimicking her and sleeping like a person, under the duvet with her head on a pillow. Is that not a bit much? \u201cI know it sounds bonkers, but why not embrace it? I don\u2019t think we\u2019re humanising animals any more than we have before \u2013 it\u2019s just the way we live now gives us more choice. That enriches the lives of my dogs, while strengthening the bond we share.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Super-spoilt\u2019 rabbit Olive. \u2018When we go away, we book her into a retreat.\u2019 Photograph: courtesy Fay Williams\n\nIt is not just dogs and cats; some rabbits, now the third-most popular pet in the UK, get the treatment, too. Fay Williams from Warrington calls herself a \u201cbunny mummy\u201d to \u201csuper-spoilt\u201d Olive. \u201cShe has her own room at the back of our house. When we go away, we book her into a retreat that specialises in looking after pampered rabbits. The owner lets me FaceTime her most days.\u201d\n\nEven parrots, like Billy from West Yorkshire, aren\u2019t missing out. \u201cEvery morning, he gets a decaffeinated tea and a better breakfast than me,\u201d says his owner, Lauren Atkinson. \u201cHe eats a mixture of seeds with unsalted nuts and he\u2019ll have some warm food like edamame beans, petits pois and sweetcorn mixed with almond milk twice a day. We call his extra-large cage \u2018the palace\u2019 \u2013 it has a play gym and java wooden stands and swings for him to relax on.\u201d\n\nAtkinson is keen to add that she is not a \u201ccrazy cockatoo lady\u201d \u2013 Billy has simply won her over. He has an Instagram account where he shares selfies and videos. \u201cHe\u2019s got more toys than a toddler and loves playing hide-and-seek, shouting \u2018Peekaboo\u2019 when he finds you,\u201d says Atkinson. \u201cHe\u2019s formed a unique bond with all my family \u2013 our mental health has improved, and it makes me want to pamper him even more. He\u2019s more than \u2018just\u2019 a pet.\u201d\n\nIn a 2018 study, 51% of consumers said they would sooner take a hit on their own spending than on their pets'\n\nLisa Morton, co-founder of the pet-drinks specialist Woof&Brew, has noticed a huge increase in people seeking shared experiences with their pets. \u201cIt means many more cafes, restaurants and hotels are opening their doors and welcoming dogs, which is where our products fit perfectly,\u201d she says. \u201cWe launched six years ago with the world\u2019s first herbal doggy teabag.\u201d Since then, their Bottom Sniffer \u201cbeer\u201d for dogs (made from a non-fermented beer wort with seaweed extract, chicken flavouring, burdock, dandelion, flax, nettle and rooibos) and pawsecco \u201cwine\u201d (an infusion of elderflower, linden blossom, ginseng, water, natural caramel and citric acid) for cats and dogs have been bestsellers; Morton is expecting another big paws up for their latest herbal tonic, Champaws. She says the modern obsession with wellness has been key to the company\u2019s success. \u201cWe know consumers have been increasingly seeking natural products for themselves, and in turn want the same for their pets.\u201d\n\nDogs such as Prudence and Mr Binks are her target customers. \u201cI never compromise on their diet,\u201d says Webb, who has had dogs for 18 years. \u201cThey eat the finest food designed for dogs \u2013 organic, ethically sourced meats \u2013 and Prudence has a special slow-feed bowl with ridges designed to make her meals last longer, and to make her eat more politely, while improving her digestion. I spend more on their food than on myself \u2013 because I know that will help keep them away from the vet.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tiffany and Dazzy from PetLondon Models.

Photograph: Alex Grace/The Guardian\n\nAs well as paying premium prices for their meals, Webb treats the dogs to special balms that help minimise the effects of rough pavements on their feet, and books them in for regular holistic health and spa treatments. \u201cPrudence benefits from a regular oxygen facial available for dogs in Harley Street, London, as well as massages and red-light therapy, as she is boisterous and always pulling muscles. Mr Binks has regular acupuncture and red-light therapy for his hip, as he has a degenerative bone condition. It\u2019s wonderful to have so many wellbeing options for them \u2013 things are getting more sophisticated.\u201d\n\nIt's no longer seen as acceptable to simply give a dog a bone\n\nThe new crop of tech solutions include remote cameras that allow owners to stay in touch when away from home, food and treat dispensers with built-in cameras, and automatic ball launchers, so that people can feed and play fetch with their pets remotely. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer seen as acceptable to simply leave a bowl of water or give a dog a bone \u2013 technology is changing and enhancing the entire feeding, wellbeing and play experience,\u201d says Rob Steele, international marketing director for the animal-security company PetSafe. This year, the brand has seen strong growth in \u201cwaste management solutions\u201d \u2013 smart litter boxes that monitor toilet activity are up 25%, while car-seat boosters and steps that can be used to get up to a bed or sofa have never been so popular. He predicts the next big trends will be \u201cconnected\u201d products. As many of us track, log and quantify our own data (calories eaten, steps taken), it follows that we will do the same for our furry housemates.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cockapoo Darcy. She has travelled to more than 20 countries with her owner. Photograph: courtesy May Wong\n\nMuch of this shift is being driven by younger pet owners. \u201cMillennials represent the largest segment of owners and are fuelling the humanisation trend,\u201d says Nicole Cooper, managing director of the National Pet Show. \u201cIt might be because they\u2019re drawn to the idea of ownership, and the emotional focus of looking after something.\u201d As more young couples delay having children, many consider pets to be their \u201cstarter\u201d babies.\n\nNicole Garnett, 26, sees evidence of this in the course of her work; she runs Paws Of Perfection, a dog-grooming parlour in Berkshire. \u201cWe\u2019re so in tune with how we look after our own wellbeing, it\u2019s definitely rubbing off on our pets. I want my dogs, Alfie and Beano [a bichon frise and a westie cross shih-tzu], to live as long as possible, and will do what I can to maintain their health. They eat raw food and have FitBark activity monitors so I can track their steps and sleep. I take them to dog hydrotherapy pools to help their mobility. They get spoiled in other ways, too, such as camping and shopping trips \u2013 they love their Barbour jackets \u2013 and every year they get a cake and a new outfit for their birthday.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bull terrier Prudence turns three. Photograph: courtesy Anna Webb\n\nDoes she think the pampering can go too far? \u201cOh yeah. Five years ago, I\u2019d never expect dogs to turn up at the shop in a pram wearing a fancy dress outfit, or that I\u2019d be giving a blueberry facial scrub to a vegan dog. Some owners say there\u2019s never a moment where their dog is left on its own, and that leaving them with us is harder than leaving their child at nursery.\u201d\n\nDarcy, a cockapoo and \u201cdog blogger\u201d from west London, has travelled to more than 20 countries with her owner, May Wong. Recently, she had a wardrobe made to house her outfits and accessories. She also had a birthday party with her pooch pals at Cliveden House hotel in Buckinghamshire, where the Duchess of Sussex spent the night before the royal wedding.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Persian chinchilla cat Vaishti has stayed at Lawlor Cat hotel five times in the past year. Photograph: courtesy Barry Lobel\n\n\u201cIt might sound over the top, but the indulgence comes from a deep emotional attachment,\u201d says Wong. \u201cI have no family and I know Darcy only cares about me. So when you experience that kind of loyalty, that you don\u2019t always get from other people, you want to give them the best you can.\u201d\n\nIs there a dark side to all this fussing? According to the British Veterinary Association (BVA), the golden rules of pet care are simple: provide them with a suitable diet and environment; protect them from pain; and make sure they are able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns. Daniella Dos Santos, the junior vice-president of the BVA, says some of the more absurd new trends aren\u2019t ticking those boxes, adding that we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that animals\u2019 health and welfare needs are different from ours. \u201cInappropriate anthropomorphism, such as giving them too many treats or human foods and treating them as fashion accessories, is unnecessary and potentially harmful,\u201d she says. \u201cPet costumes can restrict movement and their ability to regulate temperature, while \u2018handbag dogs\u2019 can suffer from poor socialisation, as they don\u2019t get as many opportunities to interact with other dogs.\u201d Her advice? \u201cIf in doubt, go back to basics and ask whether that expensive fad is really going to deliver any tangible benefits to your pet.\u201d Does she think fresh pet food is any better than the processed variety? \u201cThe most important thing is giving pets a balanced diet with specialist nutritionist input. Processed pet food may have science behind it, fresh food may not necessarily be specifically formulated to pets\u2019 needs \u2013 so owners really should speak to their vet for tailored advice.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cockatoo Billy. \u2018Every morning, he gets a decaffeinated tea and a better breakfast than me,\u2019 says his owner. Photograph: courtesy Lauren Atkinson\n\nBut the surge in spending on our animal companions shows no signs of flagging; in a 2018 Mintel study, 51% of consumers said they would sooner take a hit on their own spending than on their pets\u2019. \u201cThe uncertainty of Brexit may be affecting average consumer spending, but pets and children will always be last on the list when it comes to cutting back,\u201d says Woof&Brew\u2019s Morton. \u201cWith big lifestyle and home purchases decreasing in value, little luxuries for loved ones increase.\u201d\n\nAt Lawlor Cat hotel, the requests keep coming. \u201cOne couple recently ordered their cat, and all 14 cat guests staying in the hotel at the time, a premium \u00e0 la carte dish: the prawn and crayfish tian. Because it was what they served their (human) wedding guests. They all got to celebrate, too,\u201d says Lawlor, stroking one of her guests.\n\nAnd if the lengths people are prepared to go to often sound like a joke, Lawlor thinks our pets are the ones having the last laugh. \u201cWe think we are humanising them, but I think they\u2019re the ones controlling us. They\u2019ve looked around, they\u2019ve studied us and thought: \u2018I could train this one.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "description": "From cat spas to dogs Fitbits, pets are more fussed over than ever.
