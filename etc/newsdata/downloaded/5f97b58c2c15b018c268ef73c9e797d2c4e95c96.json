Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark A. Milley.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlong the way, Trump alluded to his feuds with the intelligence community and the media, praised a conservative television network for its coverage, boasted inaccurately that he had warned of the threats bin Laden posed before others and dismissed the need to brief Congress ahead of time on his plans because \u201cWashington is a leaking machine.\u201d He then dispatched an unlikely surrogate \u2014 Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who had criticized Trump\u2019s decision this month to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria \u2014 to the White House briefing room to praise his leadership.\n\n\u201cIt was on brand in the sense that Trump allowed his inner showman to make this a spectacle rather than a solemn moment of acknowledgment and a reflection \u2014 the way President Obama did,\u201d said Ned Price, a CIA officer at the time of bin Laden\u2019s death who later served as a spokesman for the National Security Council under Obama.\n\nFrom a cryptic tweet to a formally posed photo with aides in the Situation Room, Trump\u2019s rollout of the news contrasted sharply with the Obama White House\u2019s approach more than eight years earlier.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn May 1, 2011, the day that the Navy\u2019s highly decorated SEAL Team 6 shot bin Laden dead in a nighttime raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, then secretly disposed of his body, Obama and his top advisers watched a grainy live video feed in the Situation Room. As news of the operation began to leak out, Obama aides alerted reporters that he would be making an announcement that night.\n\nJust after 11:30 p.m., Obama delivered his televised remarks from the Cross Hall entrance to the East Room, as a small group of reporters and aides, including Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, looked on.\n\nObama spoke of the anguish of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, emphasized the nation\u2019s resolve in recovering, and praised the skill of the intelligence experts who tracked bin Laden down and the courage of the Special Forces who killed him. He also took a measure of credit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice,\u201d said a president who was routinely assailed by Republicans as weak and feckless on foreign affairs.\n\nHe took no questions from reporters.\n\nBy contrast, the Trump show on Baghdadi started with a tweet. \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d the president posted on social media Saturday evening, and the White House media office quickly announced that Trump would make a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d \u2014 11 hours later at 9 a.m. Sunday.\n\nCritics speculated that the president was eager to upstage the Sunday morning political talk shows in a bid to drown out coverage of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort against him. In his remarks, Trump suggested his early tweet was intended to give plenty of advance notice to journalists so they \u201cwouldn\u2019t be out playing golf or tennis.\u201d\n\nTrump had played golf with Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred and two Republican senators at his private Trump National club in Sterling, Va., on Saturday afternoon. White House officials declined to comment on the timing.\n\nLike Obama, Trump outlined the deadly threat of Baghdadi\u2019s organization, praised U.S. intelligence and the military and spoke of the memories of Americans killed by the Islamic State, including journalist James Foley and aid worker Kayla Mueller.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet as he fielded questions from reporters, Trump offered numerous details about the raid, including that the Special Forces collected a trove of materials about the Islamic State from the hideout and took some of Baghdadi\u2019s body parts with them.\n\n\u201cIt bothered me a little bit some of what the president did in providing details,\u201d Michael Morell, who served as acting CIA director in the Obama administration, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cBecause that\u2019s what inspires some extremists.\u201d\n\nDana Shell Smith, former U.S. ambassador to Qatar and a career diplomat, faulted Trump for providing a \u201cgruesome, vivid and probably exaggerated description of dogs chasing down Baghdadi\u201d that \u201cwill endanger our personnel in the region\u201d by inspiring other extremists.\n\nRobert Spalding, a former Air Force general who served on Trump\u2019s National Security Council until early 2018, defended the president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a risk in saying too much,\u201d Spalding said. \u201cBut the thing I liked was, there were no pictures, there was no specification of types of aircraft used. Everything I saw in terms of what was released was quite vague.\u201d\n\nTrump couldn\u2019t help but betray his anger at the House\u2019s impeachment probe over his conduct on a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader in the summer. Though he praised the intelligence officials involved in the Baghdadi raid, Trump noted that \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with some people that aren\u2019t very intelligent, having to do with intel,\u201d an apparent reference to those who sounded alarms about the Ukraine call.\n\nHe also falsely boasted that he had warned about the need to capture or kill bin Laden in a book he wrote a year before the 9/11 attacks when political leaders were ignoring the threat. In fact, Trump\u2019s book contained no such warning, and President Bill Clinton had authorized CIA operations against the al-Qaeda leader in 1998.\n\nAD", "description": "The president\u2019s 50-minute announcement at the White House was marked by the now customary mix of bravado, misleading boasts and taunts that President Trump once called \u201cmodern-day presidential.\u201d", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/P8FzMNV4p27N1GKx1qPR07NGbnE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NLMYNAXZAAI6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
