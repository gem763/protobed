Jolanta Topolska, 53, has been named as the victim who died early Sunday. Tsvetanka Kostadinova died Saturday evening.\n\nThe identities of the remaining victims have not been officially released but David Hanik, 61, and his wife also died in the shooting, his brothers told The Chicago Tribune.\n\nPolice said the victims include a 61-year-old male, a 65-year-old-female, a 30 to 35-year-old female, a 53-year-old female and a 40 to 45-year-old male.\n\nFirst Deputy Supt. Antony Riccio says the man had a history of issues with his neighbors but investigators 'don't know what set him off'.\n\nJolanta Topolska, 53, pictured, has been named as the victim who died early Sunday\n\nRiccio says it's not clear how the suspect was able to enter the apartments but there was no sign of forced entry.\n\nOf the first four people shot dead Riccio said: 'He knew everybody in the building and everybody knew him.\n\n'When he walked into that neighbor's apartment, there were four people at the table eating dinner. For reasons we yet know don't know, he opened fire on all four of those individuals, killing them all.\n\n'Most of the occupants inside the building have had problems with him in the past, but certainly nothing of this magnitude.\n\n'It definitely wasn't random. He lives in the building, he's lived there for 15 years. He knows all the victims, but he's not talking.'\n\nRiccio said other neighbors describe suspect Marek, who was reportedly in debt and had previously served as the association president, as having 'anger management issues' and 'exchanging dirty looks'.\n\nAnother neighbor said he 'snapped' about six months ago describing his behavior as as 'spooky' and 'unstable'.\n\nChicago police are seen at the Northwest Side apartment building following the shooting\n\nOfficers are said to have been called to the block two months before the shooting after Marek was accused of assaulting the son of one shooting victims but he was not arrested, The Chicago Sun Times reports.\n\nPolice spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said 'what he's being accused of is nothing short of savagery' and confirmed the incident 'stemmed from a dispute between Marek & his neighbors'.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot called the shooting 'devastating.' She wrote: 'Today's mass shooting at a condo building on W. Irving Park is devastating and almost unfathomable, except it is happening way too frequently\u2014not only here, but across our country.'\n\nShe added: 'We mourn the loss, honor the victims, and continue the hard but necessary work of keeping our neighborhoods safe, and taking guns out of the hands of those who are mentally infirm.'\n\nPolice confirmed they are looking into how Marek obtained a handgun but he is understood to have a valid firearm owner\u2019s identification card.", "description": "Krysztof Marek, left, has been charged with five felony counts of first degree murder after the Saturday evening shooting.
