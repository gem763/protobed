I managed to find one that was the same size and shape that could work.\n\nKatie VanBlaricum, 36, spotted a Monarch butterfly with a piece of its wing missing while working at her local zoo in Kansas\n\nThe volunteer managed to attach the wing with glue - after it was damaged by school children trying to get it out of a net.\n\n'Butterflies can be slowed down a little bit if you put them in the refrigerator but not for very long so I put glass plates over the top of it to keep in place,' she said.\n\n'I cut off the broken bit of wing and glued on the other wing which came from a Graphium butterfly. Then I held it for a few seconds.'\n\nA butterfly has four wings, two fore-wings and two hind-wings which are attached to segments which use its strong muscles to move the wings up and down.\n\nAfter the swift but successful procedure to repair the butterfly's left forewing, Ms VanBlaricum let it go and watched in awe as it flew up into the trees.\n\nShe said: 'It was quite stormy for a few days so I ended up keeping it over the weekend for two or three days and fed it so it would be ready to fly again.\n\n'When we finally went out it just flew up into the tree and used the wind to help it fly.'\n\nArmed with tape, glue and pins, Ms VanBlaricum got to work and managed to hold down the butterfly long enough to glue on a piece of wing taken from a dead butterfly\n\nJust a matter of days later, the insect was up and flying again and Ms VanBlaricum bid farewell to her new friend\n\nThe idea first came to her after she visited a butterfly conservation where her friend worked and saw a butterfly with a wing that didn't match the other.\n\nMs VanBlaricum began frantically researching and in 2013 carried out her first butterfly wing transplant.\n\nShe added: 'I knew it could be done, but I didn't know the best way to do it.'\n\nDespite the two parallels of her recent wing transplant and Insect Art business, Katie claims the two don't link up.\n\nMs VanBlaricum added: 'A lot of people mention that I've helped this butterfly when I've got thousands of dead insects in my basement but the two don't really link up.\n\n'The insects I use come from insect farms where they are specifically bred for this process they are not taken from the wild and we're not hurting the wild population.'\n\nThe volunteer managed to attach the wing with glue - after it was damaged by school children trying to get it out of a net", "description": "Katie VanBlaricum, 36, spotted a Monarch butterfly with a piece of its wing  missing while working at her local zoo in\u00a0Kansas.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19743034-0-image-a-53_1571147003365.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
