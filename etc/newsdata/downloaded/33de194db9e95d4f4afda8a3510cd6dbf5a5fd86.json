It\u2019s not hard to say no to a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old, a 9-year-old, etc. All you have to do is say: No.\n\nThis is a sad commentary on the state of way too many modern day parents who are afraid to discipline their kids because doing so might offend them, or cause them to suffer negative feelings.\n\nHere\u2019s the story. As Fox News reported, the boy was 14, described by his caretakers as a \u201cfussy eater,\u201d and prescribed by the family doctor B12 injections to help alleviate his tiredness. He was also advised: Clean up the diet or face some serious health consequences.\n\nA year later, the boy was suffering from vision and hearing impairments, as well as from bone weakness. And by the age of 17, he was declared legally blind \u2014 a blindness that later tests showed came about because of copper and vitamin D deficiency.\n\nNow doctors are using this kid as a warning to others to eat more than french fries and junk.\n\nYa think?\n\nThe boy\u2019s mother, in the Telegraph, said his vision and hearing losses have \u201cdevastated his life\u201d and dramatically altered hers, to the point where he\u2019s dropped out of college and she\u2019s quit work to stay home and take care of him.\n\nAnd then came this: He\u2019s still not changed his diet. In fact, his mother said that after \u201ccounseling, we managed to start him on fruit smoothies \u2014 but he\u2019s gone off those now.\u201d He eats \u201cpretty much the same\u201d as before his vision and hearing loss; he eats junk and more junk, his mother said.\n\nOK. So by now, this kid is an adult. He can choose his diet as he sees fit.\n\nBut what about the previous decade-plus when he was a minor, under the legal control of his caretakers?\n\nA mother who would allow her little boy to eat nothing but junk \u2014 beyond the point of permanently damaging the nervous system, as doctors, in this case, diagnosed \u2014 is what the foster world would call negligent, even abusive.\n\nAt the least, she\u2019s overly intimidated, too scared to exert her parental authority.\n\nAnd on that last \u2014 what a shame. Parenting these days has become far too frequently a popularity contest, where adults bend over backwards to coddle their kids so as to keep their self-esteem from crumbling and to keep their own likability factor intact.\n\nThese spoiled and entitled children grow into spoiled and entitled adults, who then turn around and demand society at-large treat them in the same accommodating manners as their foolhardy parents.\n\nThis blind and deaf kid isn\u2019t just a warning off junk food.\n\nHe\u2019s a warning where bad parenting can lead.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
