A five-year-old boy\u2019s fate is yet to be decided, activists said.\n\nAuthorities told Radio Free Asia that the Rohingya, having left villages in Rakhine state where they reportedly faced violence and ethnic cleansing, were attempting to reach Malaysia.\n\nThey allegedly paid traffickers between 500,000 and 700,000 kyats (\u00a3270-\u00a3380) to transport them to Yangon, where they hoped to find work or passage out of Myanmar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cruel irony that these Rohingya will be trading what was effectively confinement to open-air detention in Rakhinestate for confinement in a state prison in Pathein,\u201d said Brad Adams, executive director at Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\nThe Rohingya have faced waves of persecution in Myanmar. In 2017, amid alleged mass slaughter and arson attacks in their villages, more than 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, settling in refugee camps near the border.\n\nWithin Myanmar, Rohingya are prohibited from travelling outside certain areas without official permission. Myanmar considers Rohingya people illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and denies them access to basic services and rights.\n\nPhil Robertson, deputy director of HRW\u2019s Asia division, said many Rohingya remaining in Rakhine state live in virtual imprisonment, with daily life subject to multiple restrictions such as limited access to money and jobs, constant monitoring by police and violent vigilantism. \u201cIt\u2019s like apartheid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrific situation that has gone unnoticed by the world.\u201d\n\nHuman rights organisations have warned repeatedly that ongoing negotiations between Bangladesh and Myanmar about returning Rohingya refugees could lead to further persecution, especially because Myanmar continues to deny Rohingya Muslims citizenship.\n\nRohingya refugees refuse to return to Myanmar without rights guarantee Read more\n\nAdam said the imprisonment of Rohingya trying to leave the country \u201cstands as a clear marker to the United Nations and foreign governments encouraging the return of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh that Myanmar has no interest in granting its Rohingya population fundamental freedoms\u201d.\n\nThe jailed Rohingya said that they had initially set out as a group of 44 from Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine state, where they lived in townships. But their group shrunk after authorities stopped them at a jetty.\n\nThe decision to jail them came after a one-day trial at which the Rohingya were denied legal representation, said HRW.\n\nTin Hlaing, a Muslim from Thae Chaung village, who according to Radio Free Asia had tried to stop the group from travelling, said the families of the imprisoned group were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about their safety.\n\n\u201cThey are going through various hardships with a scarcity of job opportunities and restrictions on their movements,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t accept our suggestions because they felt the pressure of their hardship and joblessness.\u201d", "description": "Nine children sent to juvenile detention centres as remainder of group face up to two years in prison for failure to produce ID cards", "authors": ["Vidhi Doshi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc72f095ee4160160ba79c5b963c771b896524b/0_391_4188_2513/master/4188.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=90c7a30ebfc32a78a64456ba65403cdd", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
