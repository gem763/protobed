The World Trade Organization gave him the go-ahead, saying Europe unfairly subsidized the Airbus aerospace company.\n\nThe levies primarily hit the U.K., Germany, Spain and France \u2014 the countries that drove the unfair subsidies \u2014 though Italy\u2019s popular cheeses and other products were targeted in a push to hold the entire EU responsible.\n\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella asked Mr. Trump to ease up during a visit to the White House.\n\n\u201cHe thinks we are a little harsh on Italy,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be harsh on Italy.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is a big fan of tariffs, saying the U.S. uses them to gain the upper hand in global trade, though Mr. Mattarella said their use is a lose-lose for both sides \u2014 especially as Europe wait for permission to punish the U.S. over its own assistance to Boeing.\n\n\u201cThis is a mere race between tariffs,\u201d Mr. Mattarella said. \u201cI think it would be best to meet to deal with our mutual needs.\u201d\n\nThroughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has complained that many European nations take advantage of the U.S. on trade. He says allies ought to be reciprocal in terms of economic benefits.\n\n\u201cItaly, on the other hand, has been a great partner,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a sit-down with Mr. Mattarella in the Oval Office. \u201cItaly thinks that we\u2019re charging them too much and we will certainly take that under consideration,\u201d\n\nMr. Trump used the White House visit to hail the special bond between Italy and the U.S.\n\nThere are 16 million people in the U.S. of Italian descent, Mr. Trump said, and he pointed to the recent Columbus Day holiday as proof of their ties. He said he will never rename the holiday, an allusion to those who call it Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.\n\n\u201cI have so many Italian friends,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many Italian friends.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also pointed to Italy\u2019s struggle in accepting migrants from Libya and other parts of northern Africa, likening it to his push to combat illegal immigration across the southern U.S. border.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
