The power line pecking order is CEO, CFO, other finance/strategy, business/product management, IT, human resources and shared services. The majority of women are down the end of the power line.\n\nIn analysing the women in these roles the report confirms what Chief Executive Women and other organisations in Australia have been saying for some time \u2013 there is a distinct horizontal occupational segregation.\n\nFor example, 55 per cent of the companies have a female head of human resources and a mere 14 per cent have a female head of information technology.\n\nPolicymakers and employers have a role to play in challenging the status quo\n\nThe gender segregation is particularly acute in Australia and New Zealand. About 80 per cent of human resources heads are female and 86 per cent of IT heads are male.\n\nThe study tries to explain this by reference to work done by the World Bank which found horizontal occupational segregation persists because of societal norms and expectations, including educational choice and the unequal distribution of domestic and care responsibilities among genders.\n\nThe study will help bolster the argument that more women on boards will influence the culture within companies and lead to more women in management.\n\nThe report said that as the proportion of women on boards increases, so too does the proportion of women in senior management roles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the 50 per cent level of female board representation the study finds 30 per cent of women in management.\n\nIt is noteworthy that countries where quotas exist for boards do not necessarily have higher female representation flowing through into senior management ranks.\n\nCountries with a lower female representation in senior management and on boards were found to have a wider gender pay gap. The report said policymakers and employers have a role to play in challenging the status quo and enhancing the socioeconomic framework, which can help close the gender pay gap.", "description": "Increased diversity in the management teams of global companies has led to out-performance in the share market according to a Swiss-based research institute.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.602%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_520%2C$y_506/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f4fa5836c83bbe868008f13b156d24f260a00690", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
