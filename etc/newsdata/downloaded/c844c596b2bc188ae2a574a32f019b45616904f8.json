Online disinformation through targeted social-media campaigns and apps such as WhatsApp has already roiled elections around the world.\n\nLi's appearance on CNBC follows an appearance earlier this week at a Massachusetts Institute of Technology conference, at which he said he thought perfect deepfakes would arrive in \"two to three years.\"\n\nIn an email to CNBC after it asked for clarification, Li said recent developments, in particular the emergence of the wildly popular Chinese app Zao and the growing research focus, have led him to \"recalibrate\" his timeline.\n\n\"Also, in some ways we already know how to do it,\" Li wrote in an email, adding that it is \"only a matter of training with more data and implementing it.\"\n\nZao is a face-swapping app that allows users to take a single photograph and insert themselves into popular TV shows and movies. It is among China's most popular apps, although significant privacy concerns have arisen.\n\n\"Soon, it's going to get to the point where there is no way that we can actually detect [deepfakes] anymore, so we have to look at other types of solutions,\" Li said on \"Power Lunch.\"\n\nThat is why research by academics is important, Li said, noting his work on deepfake detection with Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\n\"If you want to be able to detect deepfakes, you have to also see what the limits are,\" Li said. \"If you need to build A.I. frameworks that are capable of detecting things that are extremely real, those have to be trained using these types of technologies, so in some ways it's impossible to detect those if you don't know how they work.\"\n\nTo Li, the issue with deepfakes isn't the existence of the technology that can create them.\n\nHe said deepfake technology presents numerous benefits for the fashion and entertainment industries, for example. It could also enhance the efficacy of video conferencing, Li said.\n\n\"The real question is how can we detect videos where the intention is something that is used to deceive people or something that has a harmful consequence,\" he said.", "description": "\"Soon, it's going to get to the point where there is no way that we can actually detect [deepfakes] anymore, so we have to look at other types of solutions,\" says Hao Li.", "authors": ["Kevin Stankiewicz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106110089-1567557567766gettyimages-1090433882.jpeg?v=1567557634", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
