Photo: Courtesy of TIFF\n\nIn William Nicholson\u2019s woebegone, autobiographical English drama Hope Gap, a meek-ish man named Edward (Bill Nighy) leaves his voluble wife, Grace (Annette Bening), and Grace responds the way many educated British characters do as they plummet emotionally: She talks. And she talks. She cries out to her husband in sheer disbelief. She wheedles, needles, and muses histrionically on the meaning of matrimony and family and human and cosmic mercy. It\u2019s not iambic pentameter, but Bening \u2014 enunciating in an English accent that had me pushing away images of Emma Thompson, as one would a stray thought while meditating \u2014 runs through periods (full stops, in the U.K.) and inserts pauses mid-sentence, to suggest the squeezing of inchoate panic through the proper channels. The accent gives Bening an odd sibilance as well as an overbite I\u2019ve never noticed: Have her very features been altered by her voice? It\u2019s a fascinating performance, but Grace is too distanced \u2014 and too borderline insufferable \u2014 to relate to fully, even if you recognize her desperation in the face of abandonment, even if you\u2019ve lived a version of that desperation yourself.\n\nThe movie \u2014 having its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival \u2014 is a brief, sad little piece that doesn\u2019t quite hurdle the blood-brain barrier and rattle you to the core, but it does achieve a half-sublimity, thanks to coastal settings with white cliffs that inspire both awe and thoughts of flinging oneself off, and also thanks to poetry. Grace\u2019s pet project is creating an anthology of poems arranged by emotional states (like, say, the feeling of abandonment), and at various points the characters intone the words of those who\u2019ve been here and done that. The big set piece, in fact, is Dante Gabriel Rossetti\u2019s \u201cSudden Light,\u201d which begins, \u201cI have been here before, / But when or how I cannot tell,\u201d and ends with a question \u2014 whether love will be restored \u201cIn death\u2019s despite, / And day and night yield delight once more?\u201d Rossetti, the cliffs, and the swelling music (by Alex Heffes) supply what the characters cannot.\n\nYou don\u2019t blame Nighy\u2019s Edward for leaving. You blame him for how he leaves, slinking off into the arms of a younger woman who has pushed him to sever his miserable marital bond. Nighy plays Edward in his familiar key of awkward formality, stammering and keeping his gaze guiltily low. Edward points out that Grace has found him so consistently annoying over the years that he wonders why she feels so angry and bereft \u2014 but if he wonders that, he doesn\u2019t know much about how some marriages work. His sudden realization that he and Grace were never meant to be is moving, but despite several melancholy monologues, the character doesn\u2019t have much stature. Much of our sympathy ends up with the couple\u2019s 29-year-old son, Jamie (Josh O\u2019Connor), whom Grace tries to use as an emissary but who isn\u2019t very good at it. He can\u2019t plead Grace\u2019s case when he doesn\u2019t fully buy it. The actor is affecting: He seems ultimately as puzzled by his parents\u2019 union as the writer-director does.\n\nNicholson is 70 and is primarily known as a writer, and in Hope Gap he doesn\u2019t conceal his artistic flourishes artfully. The camera pans from dishes piling up in the sink to the mantle with its photos and lifetime\u2019s worth of memories or hovers about the waves creeping over the rocks. Sometimes he will frame a character on the side of the wide screen, not so much to express alienation as to keep the person out of the boring center.\n\nBut he does one thing very well: comedy. Bening gets a real performance rhythm going when Grace buys a dog she names Edward, like her ex-husband, and teaches him the command, \u201cStay.\u201d Bening seems more in her element snapping at the dog than she does delivering theatrical plaints. She\u2019s marvelous when Grace volunteers for a grief hotline and ends up commiserating too deeply with her callers \u2014 I wanted even more of those scenes. But if Nicholson hasn\u2019t decided whether the end of his parents\u2019 marriage was a comedy or a tragedy, well \u2014 who ever does? He\u2019s reaching for something he never gets: That\u2019s not a bad way to lose. Unlike Grace, he loses gracefully.", "description": "William Nicholson\u2019s autobiographical English drama \u2018Hope Gap\u2019, co-staring Annette Bening and Bill Nighy, premiered at 2019\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival.", "authors": ["David Edelstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/tiff/hope-gap.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
