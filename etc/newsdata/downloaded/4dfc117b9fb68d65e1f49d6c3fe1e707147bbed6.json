REUTERS/Gary Cameron/File Photo\n\nTraders have mostly shrugged off news that the Trump administration was considering de-listing Chinese companies from U.S. stock markets after the reports were hosed down by Treasury officials, but investor sentiment remains fragile.\n\nWorries that negotiations between China and the United States will not lead to a trade deal, and deepening political uncertainty in the United States after the start of an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, have unnerved investors and boosted demand for dollars.\n\nThe U.S. currency, measured against a basket of rival currencies, rose 0.1% to 99.169 .DXY in early European trade, while against the euro it was slightly higher at $1.0929 EUR=EBS.\n\nThe dollar earlier this month hit a more than 2-year high of 99.37.\n\n\u201cWere there better stories overseas, we suspect the dollar might be a little weaker right now, but there are not (industrial production numbers are still plumbing the depths in many countries) and thus the dollar is holding its gains,\u201d ING analysts said in a research note.\n\nNew Zealand's dollar dropped 0.6% to as low as $0.6249 NZD=D3, its weakest since 2015, after a survey showed business sentiment weakening to an 11-1/2 year low in September, strengthening the case for a reduction in interest rates.\n\nhere\n\n\u201cWe are seeing from the positioning data that people have increased shorting of the Kiwi,\u201d said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a strategist at Commerzbank. \u201cA lot of people are jumping on the train again,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Australia, forecasts for a rate cut on Tuesday have risen - markets are pricing a better than 75% chance the Reserve Bank of Australia will reduce its cash rate for a third time this year.
