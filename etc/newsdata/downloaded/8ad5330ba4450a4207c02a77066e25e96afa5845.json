But the 31-year-old \u2018Gypsy King\u2019 faces an altogether different test at WWE\u2019s Crown Jewel against American Braun Strowman, winner of the greatest Royal Rumble Championship in 2018.\n\nAsked if he was worried about losing his undefeated record at the pre-fight press conference in Riyadh, Fury said: \u201cDefinitely not. I\u2019m undefeated 30 and 0 as a professional, it\u2019s going to be a good fight and I\u2019m looking forward to it. Braun is the biggest man I\u2019ve ever faced.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (17-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion has successfully moved up in weight, beating Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?
