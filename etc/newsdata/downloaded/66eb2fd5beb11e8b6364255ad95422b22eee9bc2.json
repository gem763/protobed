REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nThe talks, most of which had taken place on the Caribbean island of Barbados, began after opposition leader Juan Guaido led a failed military uprising in April against Maduro, who is accused of human rights violations and has overseen an economic collapse that has prompted millions to flee.\n\nMaduro\u2019s representatives walked away from the table in August to protest U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tightening of sanctions on the OPEC nation. Critics of the dialogue within Venezuela\u2019s opposition coalition argued that Maduro was negotiating in bad faith and used the talks to buy time.\n\n\u201cThe dictatorial regime of Nicolas Maduro abandoned the negotiation process with false excuses,\u201d Guaido\u2019s office said in a statement posted on Twitter. \u201cAfter more than 40 days in which they have refused to continue, we confirm that the Barbados mechanism is finished.\u201d\n\nNeither Venezuela\u2019s Information Ministry nor Norway\u2019s Foreign Ministry immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nGuaido - the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly - invoked Venezuela\u2019s constitution in January to assume an interim presidency, arguing Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate. He has been recognized as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader by dozens of countries, including the United States.\n\nBut Maduro, who calls Guaido a coup-mongering U.S. puppet, has held on to power despite a deepening economic slowdown and growing international isolation. The military has not abandoned him despite repeated calls by the opposition to do so, and he retains the support of Russia and China.\n\nOpposition negotiators had said Maduro\u2019s representatives were unwilling to discuss the opposition\u2019s main priority - holding a new election under free and fair conditions.\n\nIn its Sunday statement, which it called a message to \u201cthe people and the armed forces,\u201d Guaido\u2019s office thanked Norway for facilitating the process but did not specify the next steps it would take.\n\n\u201cWe must prepare to begin a new phase of this struggle that will require greater commitment, strength, determination, sacrifice and conviction from everyone,\u201d the statement said.", "description": "Venezuela's opposition said on Sunday a dialogue mediated by Norway's Foreign Ministry to try to resolve the country's political crisis had ended, six weeks after President Nicolas Maduro's government suspended participation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430307993&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F03Z", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
