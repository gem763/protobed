Kevin McCarthy shrugs off House GOP retirements: 'I think it's healthy'", "language": "en", "text": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday shrugged off a series of recent retirement announcements from Republicans in the chamber, saying it\u2019s healthy to have a decent bit of turnover and fresh faces in the ranks.\n\n\u201cAll the retirements except one [in] this cycle is in a safe seat,\u201d the California Republican said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy. I had one member come to me who\u2019s been on the ballot since 1988 \u2014 he says I can\u2019t give you a hundred percent to go win the majority. So let\u2019s bring some new people in at the same time. This is about a revolution, not a retirement.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed to Republican Dan Bishop, who won the recent do-over election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District by about 4,000 votes, after Republican Mark Harris had led Democrat Dan McCready by about 900 votes in the 2018 election before the results were thrown out amid allegations of absentee ballot fraud.\n\n\u201cThat simple increase would automatically increase 13 more seats in Congress, and we only need 19 for the majority,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nThus far, at least three Democrats and 12 Republicans have announced plans to retire ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nMr. McCarthy had previously said that President Trump running at the top of the ticket will help the GOP retake the majority in the House next year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
