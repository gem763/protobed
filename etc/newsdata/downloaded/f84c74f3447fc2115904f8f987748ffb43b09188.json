(He denies the accusation.)\n\nIn Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, counsel for Giuffre and Dershowitz argued over whether the defamation suit should be dismissed\u2014despite Dershowitz\u2019s previous claims to the press that he welcomed such litigation to prove his innocence\u2014and whether Giuffre\u2019s lawyers should be disqualified from the case.\n\nDershowitz argues Giuffre\u2019s lawyer David Boies and his firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, should be booted from the case because the defense will call them as witnesses. Dershowitz claims a member of Boies\u2019 firm consulted with Dershowitz and nearly represented him in 2015 over Giuffre\u2019s allegations. He also claims to have a secret phone recording where Boies allegedly questions his own client\u2019s credibility.\n\nBoies\u2019 firm has denied Dershowitz\u2019s interpretation of events, saying that Boies has no doubts Giuffre is telling the truth, and that he was speaking hypothetically with Dershowitz, who, he says, is taking the recording out of context.\n\nImran Ansari, a lawyer for Dershowitz, told Judge Loretta Preska that he plans to file a transcript of the recording under seal. Ansari also referred to a separate conversation relating to Wexner, prompting Judge Preska to say Wexner was \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the arguments.\n\nBut Howard Cooper, another lawyer for Dershowitz, replied that Giuffre\u2019s complaint accuses Dershowitz of making defamatory statements relating to Wexner, and that one of Dershowitz\u2019s defenses in court will be proving his claims are true. (\u201cRoberts made up the accusations out of whole cloth in order to obtain millions of dollars from Leslie Wexner,\u201d Dershowitz declared in December 2018, according to Giuffre\u2019s lawsuit.)\n\nWexner\u2019s name also came up while Dershowitz\u2019s team tried arguing that he couldn\u2019t be sued for repeating in 2018 and 2019 \u201cvirtually the same statements\u201d he made in 2015.\n\nSigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Giuffre, disagreed and told the court that Dershowitz hasn\u2019t merely been recycling his 2015 statements. Instead, she said he\u2019s elaborated on his old claims and referred to other individuals including Wexner. \u201cThese statements go well beyond his statements in 2015,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c We will prove that Sigrid McCawley and David Boies went to Les Wexner\u2019s lawyers and said that Les Wexner had sex with Virginia Giuffre between five and 10 times and that Les Wexner insisted that she wear Victoria\u2019s Secret-type lingerie. \u201d \u2014 Alan Dershowitz\n\nMcCawley argued that the law doesn\u2019t allow someone to become a \u201cserial defamer\u201d and avoid legal accountability after they\u2019ve said one bad thing about someone in the past. Every new publication of defamatory statements triggers a new statute of limitations, she said.\n\nMcCawley argued Giuffre has an actual malice claim against Dershowitz because he \u201cwent to the media and said he wanted to be sued\u201d by Giuffre. Dershowitz \u201cknew he had abused my client, then went before the public and called her a liar,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Cooper said Dershowitz has continued to call Giuffre a \u201cliar\u201d in order to defend his reputation\u2014referring to the constant stream of news relating to Dershowitz\u2019s friend and former client, wealthy sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein. \u201cWhat would someone in Professor Dershowitz\u2019s position do?\u201d Cooper asked Judge Preska.\n\nAfter the proceeding, Dershowitz and his team addressed reporters outside the courthouse, where the Harvard academic claimed he was \u201cdefending not only my right but the rights of everyone who\u2019s ever been falsely accused.\u201d\n\nAsked for proof that Giuffre\u2019s claims were false, Dershowitz said, \u201cI am standing here in front of you the media and I am stating unequivocally without the protection of defamation privilege, subject to being sued for defamation, I am saying to you I never met Virginia Giuffre. I never had sex with her. And the reason I\u2019m saying it is because it\u2019s true. She on the other had\u2026 has never and will never stand in front of any media and repeat her lie saying that she did have sex with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe you. We don\u2019t believe you. Go back to your office!\u201d a woman in the crowd yelled over Dershowitz, but he was undeterred.\n\nWhen a reporter asked about the Victoria\u2019s Secret mogul, Epstein\u2019s only known client, Dershowitz replied, \u201cLes Wexner will be a major witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will prove that [Giuffre\u2019s attorneys] Sigrid McCawley and David Boies went to Les Wexner\u2019s lawyers and said that Les Wexner had sex with Virginia Giuffre between five and 10 times and that Les Wexner insisted that she wear Victoria\u2019s Secret-type lingerie. And I can\u2019t imagine any reason for having that conversation unless it was part of an effort to obtain money. So we will call Les Wexner as a witness, we will call Sigrid McCawley as a witness, we will call David Boies, we will call Les Wexner\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cAnd our goal is simply to have the entire whole truth come out.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Wexner declined to comment.\n\nThose close to Wexner, however, appear to have denied Dershowitz's claims since 2015, when one insider told the New York Times that Wexner had never met Giuffre and that no extortion attempt was made.\n\nBrad Edwards, a longtime lawyer for victims of Epstein, recently told reporters that he did not believe Wexner had knowledge of Epstein's abuse of underage girls.\n\n\u201cI believe, based on the information that we have accumulated over 11 years, that the statements that he [Wexner] gave yesterday in the press that he did not know about the sexual proclivities of Mr. Epstein, are very highly likely to be true,\u201d Edwards said in July.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen where he is in the company of Jeffrey Epstein at the time when he was engaging in these things,\u201d Edwards added. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s very seldom that many of the victims actually even met him or saw him. I do know that there\u2019s a lot of business ties to him, but other than receiving information about their business connection, I don\u2019t have any information to believe otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201c 'We don\u2019t believe you. We don\u2019t believe you. Go back to your office!' a woman in the crowd yelled over Dershowitz, but he was undeterred. \u201d\n\nIn affidavits filed as exhibits in the defamation suit, McCawley and Boies denied Dershowitz\u2019s extortion claims.\n\n\u201cMr. Dershowitz asserts that I participated in an attempt and a conspiracy to extort Leslie Wexner,\u201d McCawley stated. \u201cAgain, Dershowitz cites no evidence to support his assertions, and they are false.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Boies stated that \u201cno settlement demand was ever made of, or even discussed with, Mr. Wexner or his counsel.\u201d\n\nDershowitz also claimed on Tuesday that Giuffre and her lawyers have \u201cdone a terrible disservice\u201d to the #MeToo movement.\n\nWhen Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown asked Dershowitz why he goaded Giuffre to sue him and is now trying to dismiss her case, Cooper jumped in, \u201cThere\u2019s a competing balance between inviting a lawsuit and putting forth First Amendment defenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot be faced with this situation and let the First Amendment die on the vine,\u201d Cooper added.\n\nBrown countered that Dershowitz could vindicate himself by going through with the trial as he said he wanted to do.\n\n\u201cHe could vindicate himself by talking as he is now,\u201d Cooper replied. \u201cDenying the allegations and making clear that he\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d\n\nDershowitz intoned a now-familiar line, \u201cI predict that if this case goes to trial, perjury will be committed in this courtroom. Because I will swear unequivocally I never met this woman, and if she says that she ever met me or had sex with me, she will be committing perury.\u201d\n\nDershowitz said he invited the FBI to attend the trial, which he now wants dismissed, to determine who is committing perjury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d he declared.", "description": "In his legal battle with an Epstein victim, the lawyer claims the young woman accused Les Wexner of forcing her into sex\u2014and insisting she wear Victoria's Secret lingerie.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2028,w_3606,x_0,y_315/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569354432/190924-briquelet-dershowitz-tease_ahhkma", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
