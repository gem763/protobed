That\u2019s an average of almost 22 claims a day since our last update 65 days ago.\n\nOne big reason for the uptick: The uproar over Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president on July 25 \u2014 in which he urged an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election rival \u2014 and the ensuing House impeachment inquiry. We\u2019ve added a new category of claims, Ukraine probe, and in just a few weeks it has topped 250 entries.\n\nIn fact, Trump earned his fastest Bottomless Pinocchio ever with his repeated false statement that the whistleblower compliant about the call was inaccurate. The report accurately captured the content of Trump\u2019s call and many other details have been confirmed, yet Trump has repeated this Four-Pinocchio claim 29 times. (It takes 20 repeats of a Three or Four-Pinocchio claim to merit a Bottomless Pinocchio, and there are now 27 entries.)\n\nAnother false claim \u2014 that Biden forced the resignation of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he was investigating his son Hunter \u2014 just barely missed the cutoff for inclusion. (Trump has said it 18 times.) We presume the falsehood will earn a spot on the Bottomless Pinocchio page in the next update.\n\nTrump crossed the 10,000 mark on April 26. From the start of his presidency, he has averaged nearly 14 such claims a day.\n\nAlmost one-fifth of these claims are about immigration, his signature issue \u2014 a percentage that has grown since the government shut down over funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In fact, his most repeated claim \u2014 218 times \u2014 is that his border wall is being built. Congress balked at funding the concrete barrier he envisioned, so he has tried to pitch bollard fencing and repairs of existing barriers as \u201ca wall.\u201d\n\nFalse or misleading claims about trade, the economy and the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign each account for about 10 percent of the total. Claims on those subjects are also among his most repeated.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed 204 times that the U.S. economy today is the best in history. He began making this claim in June 2018, and it quickly became one of his favorites. The president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books. By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson or Bill Clinton \u2014 or Ulysses S. Grant. Moreover, the economy is beginning to hit the head winds caused by Trump\u2019s trade wars, with the manufacturing sector in an apparent recession.\n\nOn 171 occasions, he has claimed that the United States has \u201clost\u201d money on trade deficits. This reflects a basic misunderstanding of economics. Countries do not \u201close\u201d money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates.\n\nTrump has falsely said 171 times that he passed the biggest tax cut in history. Even before his tax cut was crafted, he promised that it would be the biggest in U.S. history \u2014 bigger than Ronald Reagan\u2019s in 1981. Reagan\u2019s tax cut amounted to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product, and none of the proposals under consideration came close to that level. Yet Trump persisted in this fiction even when the tax cut was eventually crafted to be the equivalent of 0.9 percent of GDP, making it the eighth-largest tax cut in 100 years. This continues to be an all-purpose applause line at the president\u2019s rallies.\n\nThe president\u2019s constant Twitter barrage also adds to his totals. Nearly 20 percent of the false and misleading statements stemmed from his itchy Twitter finger.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for repeating false claims is demonstrated by the fact that the Fact Checker database has recorded more than 350 instances in which he has repeated a variation of the same claim at least three times.\n\nEven as Trump\u2019s fact-free statements proliferate, there is evidence that his approach is failing.\n\nFewer than 3 in 10 Americans believe many of his most-common false statements, according to a Washington Post Fact Checker poll published in December. Only among a pool of strong Trump approvers \u2014 about 1 in 6 adults in the survey \u2014 did large majorities accept several, although not all, of his falsehoods as true.\n\nThe award-winning database website, created by graphics reporter Leslie Shapiro, has an extremely fast search engine that will quickly locate suspect statements the president has made. We encourage readers to explore it in detail. We recently added a new feature that provides a URL for every claim that is fact-checked, allowing readers to post the link on social media.\n\nNote: The Fact Checker welcomes academic research of the Trump claims database.
