The mad scramble that followed the restart (\u201cThe worst kick-off I\u2019ve ever seen from England\u2019s point of view,\u201d Sir Clive Woodward later said). Will Greenwood at first receiver and on all fours. Mike Catt\u2019s looping kick for touch. Wilkinson\u2019s arms raised above his head, scarcely able to believe it all. Then the relief of the referee\u2019s whistle and the rushing ecstasy. Surely that can\u2019t be topped?\n\n\u201cYes, 100%,\u201d says Lawrence Dallaglio, addressing whether victory on Saturday would eclipse the success of the \u201803 team. According to the former international, England have the chance to reach new, previously unscaled heights. \u201cIf they win the World Cup, which they\u2019ve got every chance of doing, it will probably be the best World Cup win ever,\u201d he says. \u201cTo win a World Cup you need to win seven games, normally two of them tend to be against southern hemisphere opponents.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cBut for them to do back to back, all three, I\u2019m not sure what you could call that: a try nations? It\u2019s pretty impressive, but they've got one more to go. It'd be an amazing achievement.\n\n\u201cIf they go on and win it \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be a very tough game, to have played the three southern hemisphere teams in consecutive weekends \u2013 I don\u2019t think anyone could deny that they wouldn\u2019t deserve to win the World Cup.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is the least he deserves for all the hard work he has put in. Getty\n\nThe victory over New Zealand alone was worthy of a World Cup medal. Against all expectations, Eddie Jones\u2019 men delivered a knockout punch that left the reigning champions dazed and bewildered under the Yokohama lights. While the possibility of an England victory was always on the cards, few anticipated the men in white to dominate in the fashion they did. Dallaglio, who was there that night in Sydney 16 years ago, believes it will go down in sporting history as \u201cone of the all-time great Rugby World Cup performances\u201d.\n\n\u201cI would almost go as far to say it\u2019s the most complete England performance we\u2019ve seen for quite some time if indeed ever \u2013 and I say that with a huge amount of pride,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was breathless from start to finish. It\u2019s not often that a team has a game plan and is able to go out on the pitch and almost from the first minute execute that game plan almost perfectly really.\u201d\n\nMore than this, it was the reaction of the England players in the wake of victory which, for Dallaglio, reaffirmed the ice-cold mindset embedded within Jones\u2019 squad. There was no animated celebrations or mass hysteria. Instead, it was subdued, calm. England will have known that the job isn\u2019t done yet.\n\n\u201cWhat was really impressive is that at the final whistle yes of course they were pleased, there were big smiles, big hugs and everything, but they seemed to be fairly grounded and under control and recognise that it was a semi-final and not a final,\u201d says Dallaglio. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sign for this England team.\u201d\n\nAgainst South Africa, though, England take on a very different beast. Whereas the semi-final was all about nullifying the All Blacks\u2019 cutting style of rugby, with its endless tricks and flicks, Jones and men must now rustle up a game plan to blunt the Springboks\u2019 physicality without getting sucked into a draining arm wrestle. It\u2019s a hard balance to strike, but Dallaglio is confident Jones has what it takes to draw the required performance from his men.\n\n\u201cIn Eddie Jones they\u2019ve got an immensely experienced coach,\u201d adds the former England captain. \u201cHe\u2019s been to the World Cup and won [as assistant coach with South Africa], been to the World Cup and lost. So he\u2019s well qualified to present them with all the emotions and all the material that they need.\n\n\u201cClearly they\u2019ll look at South Africa in great detail, like they do with all their other opponents and come up with a way of playing. But it\u2019s going to be tough. We can\u2019t expect them to go out and do what necessarily they did to New Zealand. South Africa have proved they\u2019re a very difficult side to beat. They\u2019ve only conceded four tries in the whole tournament, two of them against the All Blacks in the first game. They\u2019re a tough nut to crack.\u201d\n\nShould they get the job done, a place in the history books awaits for Jones and his men. But should they fall short, thereby following in the footsteps of the \u201907 team, Dallaglio believe it doesn\u2019t be the end for this particular cohort \u2013 as was the case in Paris 12 years ago.\n\nUnder Jones, England have slowly but surely developed into a world-class outfit, one that is teeming with elite quality and potential. There\u2019s been plenty of bumps and lumps along the way, but such moments have collectively helped the side reach where they are today. The process of tweaking and refining and experimenting has handed Jones a squad that is now capable of delivering a new reign of English dominance in the sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d Dallaglio says. \u201cThis is a team that is still very much discovering how good they can potentially be. The exciting thing is that there\u2019s a lot more to come from this England side.\u201d", "description": "You\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t get much better than the heights of 2003: a last-minute drop-kick, victory over Australia in their own backyard and a first taste of World Cup glory.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/14/lawrence-dallaglio.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
