The move would likely leave its Palestinian inhabitants completely encircled and largely trapped in isolated enclaves.\n\nFlanked by ministers in a marquee filled with Israeli flags in the settlement of Mevo\u2019ot Yericho, Netanyahu said on Sunday that annexing the Jordan Valley \u2013 which straddles the Jordanian border and the northern Dead Sea \u2013 \u201cguarantees that the [Israeli] military will be here forever\u201d.\n\nHe said the expansion of Israel to the east would give the country \u201cstrategic depth\u201d.\n\nThe cabinet also approved Mevo\u2019ot Yericho as an official settlement, giving it a permanent status under Israeli law. It was the first time in nearly two decades that the government had held a meeting in the occupied territories, where more than 2.5 million Palestinians live under military rule among roughly 600,000 Israeli settlers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Netanyahu speaks during the cabinet meeting held in the Jordan Valley.

Palestine was shown as a disjointed mass in the middle.\n\nNaftali Bennett \u05d1\u05e0\u05d8 (@naftalibennett) \u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5, \u05d7\u05e9\u05d5\u05e3 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e4\u05d4!\n\n\n\n\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05de\u05e7\u05e4\u05d9\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc \u05e8\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc *\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd* \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e9\u05d8\u05d7\u05d9 \u05e1\u05d9 \u05e9\u05de\u05e1\u05d1\u05d9\u05d1?\n\n\n\n\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d2\u05d6\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea, \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05dc?\n\n\n\n\u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d8\u05e8\u05d0\u05de\u05e4 \u05d4\u05e1\u05db\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05e2\u05db\u05d1 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d5\u05dd \u05ea\u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5 \u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 *\u05dc\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8* \u05d4\u05d1\u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea?\n\n\n\n\u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05e2 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05de\u05e1\u05ea\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05ea \u05de\u05e4\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea? pic.twitter.com/hrRuOJLhtR\n\nHowever, Bennett, a far-right ultranationalist who is running against Netanyahu, released the plan in an effort to show that the prime minister was not doing enough to expand Israeli control over Palestinian land.\n\nBennett, who wants Israel to annex the majority of the West Bank, called the map \u201chell\u201d for settlers as they would be \u201cislands in an ocean of Palestine\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian contacted the US government for comment. Israeli media cited unnamed US officials denying the map was accurate.\n\nIsrael is due to hold its second election in five months after Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, was unable to form a coalition government. Facing political defeat, he forced a repeat election.\n\nFinal opinion polls released on Friday suggest razor-thin margins between his ruling Likud party and the centrist Blue and White alliance led by the former military chief Benny Gantz. It is possible there will be no clear winner, which could kick off weeks of political deal-making with smaller parties to decide Israel\u2019s next government.\n\nNetanyahu has sought to play up his diplomatic acumen and relationships with strongman leaders, especially Trump, to convince voters they need him. Trump said on Saturday that he and Netanyahu had spoken about a possible US-Israeli defence treaty, comments seen as an 11th-hour election gift to the prime minister.\n\nAs in previous elections, the 69-year-old leader has been accused of overtly racist messaging that demonises the country\u2019s substantial Arab minority.\n\nHis Likud party has issued unfounded warnings that the election could be stolen through voter fraud in Arab areas, a move slammed as a scaremongering attempt to rally voters who fear their political power. And on Thursday, Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on the prime minister\u2019s official page for breaching the company\u2019s hate speech policy after it warned of Arabs who \u201cwant to destroy us all\u201d.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Arab parties are expected to win significant seats after reunifying into a single alliance, similar to 2015 when they became the third-largest force in the Knesset. It is possible they could gather enough seats to block Netanyahu from continuing as prime minister.\n\nPolls also show the far-right extremist Jewish Power party, whose members have called for the expulsion of Arabs, could enter parliament. If it does, Netanyahu is expected to bring it into a coalition government.", "description": "Government meeting is the first in Palestinian territories for almost two decades", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4736d70c6bdc92ae0f02eb54724aebc7bdbab54d/1428_704_1723_1034/master/1723.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=80d122dc1dff2fc16c9fbcd019b195df", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
