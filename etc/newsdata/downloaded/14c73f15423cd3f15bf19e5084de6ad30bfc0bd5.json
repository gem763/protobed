Kamala Harris, right, has dropped 8 points to fifth place in the field, losing ground to former Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, right, in a new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll. | Win McNamee/Getty Images 2020 Elections Poll: Biden and Warren on the rise, while Harris plummets among 2020 field\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren both made steady climbs after last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, while Sen. Kamala Harris has plummeted since her breakout performance in the first debate this summer, according to a new poll out on Tuesday.\n\nThe national NBC/Wall Street Journal poll of Democratic primary voters found that while Biden maintains a lead among the field, climbing 5 points in the last two months, Warren has also been on the rise, posting a 6-point gain since July. But Biden (31 percent) still has a 6-point lead on Warren (25 percent), with Sen. Bernie Sanders rising 1 point to 14 percent in the poll.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has dropped 8 points to fifth place in the field, falling behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose support remained unchanged at 7 percent.\n\nOnly three other candidates garnered more than 1 percent in the poll, which doesn\u2019t have any ramifications on the fourth Democratic primary debate next month: Entrepreneur Andrew Yang rose 2 points to 4 percent, while Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker each doubled their support to reach 2 percent.\n\nThe survey, which took place starting the day after last week\u2019s debate in Houston, points to Warren\u2019s solidifying place among the top three candidates in the field, as well as a hardening gap separating the top and mid-tier candidates in the race.\n\nWhile the former vice president still leads his rivals in Tuesday\u2019s survey, several data points underscored Warren\u2019s recent surge to the top tier of White House hopefuls. The Massachusetts senator holds a 10-point lead among voters who said they were enthusiastic about their preferred candidate, and is the only candidate in the top three for whom enthusiasm has grown since March of this year.\n\nThe 35 percent of voters who said they were enthusiastic about Warren represent a 15-point gain since then, while Sanders, who comes in second in enthusiasm, has seen a drop of 3 points, to 25 percent. Enthusiasm for Biden has dropped by 10 points, to 23 percent, since March, which was before he formally announced his bid.\n\nWarren also topped voters\u2019 list of second choices for the Democratic nominee, garnering 21 percent support to Sanders\u2019 16 percent, Buttigieg\u2019s 12 percent and Biden\u2019s 11 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, a majority of Democratic primary voters \u2014 56 percent \u2014 said they preferred a candidate who proposed \u201clarger scale policies that cost more and might be harder to pass into law, but could bring major change\u201d on issues like climate change, health care and economic opportunity. That compares with 40 percent who said they favored a candidate proposing a more incremental approach.\n\nStill, nearly 8 in 10 voters said they were satisfied that former President Barack Obama did as much as possible during his presidency to address issues facing the country, a boon for Biden\u2019s strategy of tying himself to the accomplishments of his former boss despite criticism from some of his rivals.\n\nThe NBC/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted Sept. 13-16 among 506 Democratic primary voters, including more than half who were reached by cellphone. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.", "description": "Only eight candidates garnered more than 1 percent in the poll.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/02/e9/51ea996b49cf8b66cfb9a7c8169e/190917-warren-biden-harris-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
