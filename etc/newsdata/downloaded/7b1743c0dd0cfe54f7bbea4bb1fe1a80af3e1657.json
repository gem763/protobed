Nobody ever wants to get stuck in an airport while travelling from overseas, but if you can be stuck in a nice one, isn't that so much better?\n\nThe study looked at all aspects of the travel experience in the U.S., starting from when you check in at the airport and go through security to what your shopping and eating options are and how complicated it is to get to your gate.\n\nAirports were broken down by Mega, Large and Medium.\n\nPractically speaking, this information is probably not going to do you a tremendous amount of good. We all are likely limited by where we live and where we\u2019re headed when it comes to airport selection. That said, this list can come in handy when you\u2019re thinking about where you want to have a connection if travelling internationally.\n\nI know when I travel I often have the choice between a few different airports when it comes to where I schedule a layover. More often than not, I personally select flying through Atlanta for international trips, simply because it splits an international flight in half from the west coast, isn\u2019t as hard to navigate as New York City\u2019s airports, and I know exactly where the Bojangles is (priorities!).\n\nI\u2019ll also intentionally stop in Vegas, because there\u2019s tons of food, and slot machines if you really get bored. Plus, Vegas has the largest number of hotel rooms in the world (seriously), so if I do get stranded, at least I can drown my sorrows in a yard of frozen strawberry daiquiri while betting on the ponies.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lot to be said for connecting in an airport you\u2019re familiar with, especially when you\u2019re dealing with a tight connection. Same goes for an airport having a decent food selection. During a recent layover, and consequently severely delayed flight, I only had the option to eat at a Pizza Hut. Specifically, a Pizza Hut that closed one hour into that four-hour delay. Not ideal.\n\nYou want an airport with food options that stay open late. Sure, you might not eat while you\u2019re there, but it\u2019s nice to have the option if you do (or if you get unexpectedly stranded).\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the top U.S. airports from the study that offer the best overall experience. Next time you\u2019re booking a trip with a layover, if one of these is an option, it\u2019s likely a safe bet.\n\nMega\n\nDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport\n\nMinneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport\n\nLas Vegas McCarran International Airport\n\nOrlando International Airport\n\nLarge\n\nPortland International Airport\n\nDallas Love Field\n\nTampa International Airport\n\nMedium\n\nIndianapolis International Airport\n\nJacksonville International Airport\n\nBuffalo Niagara International Airport", "description": "The 2019 North American Airport Satisfaction Study was released last week and along with it a ranking of airports in the United States.
