Nvidia represents the edge, and Microsoft is making a pitch to be the cloud service provider.\n\nTighter connectivity to cloud services is one way that Nvidia can ensure its stack of hardware and software tools makes an appealing choice for telecommunications companies casting around for the right hardware provider to complement their networking services. Another is to make sure that Nvidia\u2019s chipsets are developer friendly.\n\nTo achieve that, the company also is expanding on its partnership with RedHat to speed up the adoption of Kubernetes in data centers and to telecom infrastructure through the newly announced Nvidia Aerial software development toolkit.\n\n\u201cThe industry is ramping 5G and the \u2018smart everything\u2019 revolution is beginning. Billions of sensors and devices will be sprinkled all over the world enabling new applications and services,\u201d said Huang. \u201cWe\u2019re working with Red Hat to build a cloud-native, massively scalable, high-performance GPU computing infrastructure for this new 5G world. Powered by the NVIDIA EGX Edge Supercomputing Platform, a new wave of applications will emerge, just as with the smartphone revolution.\u201d", "description": "Nvidia is making a hard pitch at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress Los Angeles that the future of software defined 5G networks should be powered by its chipsets.
