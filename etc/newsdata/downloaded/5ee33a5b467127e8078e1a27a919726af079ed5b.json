The accolades were as limiting as they were well-intentioned, burdening Tamko as a corrective to a sound that probably didn\u2019t represent the sum of her ambition or ability. Whether it\u2019s a natural evolution or a pointed refusal, her second album swaps crunching guitars for a softer, mostly synthetic setting, a sound as expansive as it is intimate.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vagabon: Vagabon album art work\n\nAs a producer, she favours lagoon-like spaciousness, attention to detail and unpredictable structures: Flood starts out with Tamko singing in a detached tone, building suspense that breaks with a blown-out percussive run indebted to Phil Collins. What follows is trip-hoppy murkiness that seems to endlessly turn in on itself, catching the listener in Tamko\u2019s hall of mirrors: \u201cEven if I run from it, I\u2019m still in it.\u201d She consistently narrows the focus to lure you in to her predicament: \u201cI hoped you\u2019d still be here,\u201d she repeats sombrely on In a Bind, the atmospheric production conjuring the empty room.\n\nVagabon review \u2013 indie's enchanting outcast roars in ear-bleeding triumph Read more\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual record made more beguiling by Tamko\u2019s deep and adaptable voice. Floating on a lovely, minimal synth refrain that winks like a cloud of fireflies, Water Me Down is about disappointment. But as Tamko drives the message home, the soft four-to-the-floor beat grows starker, her voice more euphoric. Her refusal of sadness links to the more straightforward, acoustic Every Woman: \u201cWe reserve the right to be full when we\u2019re on our own / No, I\u2019m not alone.\u201d This eye for social dynamics adds sharp edges to a tender record. On the blown-out Wits About You, she rejects a party that \u201cwon\u2019t let my people in\u201d and declares she\u2019ll build her own institutions. She knows that entry is no guarantee of acceptance: \u201cYou know me when it serves you to tell everyone,\u201d she sings on Please Don\u2019t Leave the Table, her pleas for respect buoyed by a brassy pulse. Tamko changed the album\u2019s name at the last minute from All the Women in Me to Vagabon \u2013 the implication being that her multifaceted artistry should be taken as read. It\u2019s well-earned.", "description": "Swapping crunching guitars for softer electronics, Laetitia Tamko\u2019s second album is both sharp and tender", "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7e6df0ad54ef057f76e2413ad439184313abb2a/0_394_5581_3348/master/5581.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2ffc4e46c344138b4d566b254576a6d2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
