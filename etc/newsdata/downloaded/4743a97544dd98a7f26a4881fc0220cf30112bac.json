They are trying to impose a standard not followed by the whole industry,\u201d said a source with direct knowledge of the sourcing issue.\n\nCodelco would let the LME delist its brands if the costs in time and money of implementing the LME guidelines \u201care unreasonable\u201d, the source added.\n\nCodelco told Reuters in a statement it \u201cis participating and analyzing in detail the process that the LME is carrying out and will adopt a decision regarding its implementation when there is greater clarity regarding its content.\u201d\n\n\u201cCodelco expects that if the LME definitively establishes a standard related to responsible supply, this will be made effective through an efficient, expeditious and easily managed mechanism by the companies, so as not to affect the fluid performance of the market,\u201d the company said.\n\nAntofagasta declined to comment.\n\nCHINA BARRIER\n\nThe implementation of the responsible sourcing initiative will depend on support from metal producers with LME-approved brands, including firms from China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of industrial metals such as copper and aluminum.\n\nSun Lihui, director of the development department at the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals & Chemicals Importers & Exporters (CCCMC), said his organization would provide \u201ctechnical support to Chinese companies\u201d over the policy and CCCMC had discussed the issue at two meetings with the LME.\n\n\u201cWe hope this will encourage more companies to meet international standards and requirements,\u201d he said, saying the policy \u201cposes a great challenge\u201d for Chinese firms.\n\nOther industry sources said a lack of Chinese legislation and experience in sourcing conflict-free minerals was hindering Chinese engagement in the process, compared to other areas of the world which were actively addressing the issue.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. have Dodd-Frank and the EU is legislating on conflict minerals. The experience and knowledge is there,\u201d a source at a copper producer said.\n\nDodd-Frank legislation requires companies operating in conflict areas such as Democratic Republic of Congo to conduct due diligence to establish minerals are conflict-free. The minerals involved are tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.\n\nThe European Union in May 2017 passed a regulation to stop mine workers being abused and conflict minerals being exported to the EU. The EU requirement to ensure mineral imports are responsibly sourced will become effective on Jan. 1, 2021.", "description": "The London Metal Exchange (LME) will postpone plans to ban metal tainted by human rights abuses until 2025, giving producers three more years to comply with guidelines and the exchange time to rethink its approach, industry sources said.", "authors": ["Pratima Desai", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431290488&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1DC", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
