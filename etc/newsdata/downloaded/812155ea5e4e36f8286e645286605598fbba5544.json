We were what I describe as a fantastic team. We were a happy family.'\n\nHe said any arguments were 'typical arguments that any family would have in day to day life'.\n\nThey carried out home improvements and brought a investment property in Turkey to also use for holidays.\n\nThe court has already heard Lacomba claimed Ms Wellgreen's new boyfriend Neil James (pictured) was 'paranoid' when he first reported her missing\n\nLacomba also told the court that Miss Wellgreen began to see her her GP regarding 'anger issues' and for which she was prescribed medication.\n\nHe said he did not know however that in 2009 and 2010 she had felt suicidal.\n\nBut he told the court 'trust had gone out of their relationship' after Miss Wellgreen discovered she was pregnant at a time when they had decided together she would be sterilised.\n\nHe said he also had 'divided loyalties' in 2012 when Miss Wellgreen and his mother fell out over allegations of a sexual nature against his father.\n\nThey then decided to split in June 2014 after Miss Wellgreen told him she had met another man on holiday.\n\n'She said 'I need to know do you still love me?' After all I had been feeling for a good while I said 'No, I don't.'\n\n'I decided to be completely honest with her. She said 'Ok then, that's what I needed to know.'.'\n\nLacomba said Miss Wellgreen then began a new relationship with a man called Shaun Green, and on one occasion he changed the locks at their home after she told him to leave the property.\n\nAt this point, Ms Trowler asked: 'Would it be fair to say that from that point forward the situation between yourself and Sarah Wellgreen was somewhat acrimonious?'\n\nProsecutors say movements of a taxi they believe is Lacomba's after Ms Wellgreen went missing show he was her killer, despite her not having been found. Pictured: Lacomba's car\n\nLacomba replied: 'Exactly.'\n\nThe prosecution allege Lacomba murdered Miss Wellgreen 'in a calculated manner' on the night of October 9 and into the early hours of October 10, before disposing of her body 'to avoid detection'.\n\nAlthough they were sharing a home in Bazes Shaw, the court heard they lived separate lives and Miss Wellgreen was in the process of buying Lacomba out of the four-bedroom property.\n\nThe day before she vanished she had also landed herself a well-paid job selling hair products and was said to be 'optimistic' and 'in good spirits', planning her future with her children.\n\nBut the court heard there was 'tension and problems' between Miss Wellgreen and Lacomba, and his possible motive for murdering her, say the prosecution, was the potential loss of his property and resulting limited contact with his children.\n\nMiss Wellgreen was last seen alive on neighbour's CCTV as she returned home at 7.57pm on October 9.\n\nDespite extensive searches of more than 1,250 areas identified by police and trawling approximately 22,000 hours of CCTV within a five-mile radius of her home have not revealed any trace or uncovered her body.\n\nHer Hyundai car, handbag, purse, phones and jewellery were left behind and she had no contact with any of her family or friends after 10pm on October 9.\n\nPolice 'proof of life' inquiries carried out in January, April and September this year into any telephone, banking, email, social media or overseas travel activity revealed no evidence that she was alive, the court was told.\n\nThe prosecution say 'compelling evidence' points to him being responsible for her death.\n\nThe footage filmed at several houses and farm buildings near the beautician's home in Kent\n\nThis includes CCTV footage of a vehicle 'similar' to his Vauxhall Zafira taxi driving along isolated country lanes between 2.20am and 4.27am on October 10 - with a two-hour gap in which the vehicle could not be traced.\n\nIt is alleged that the car was seen with mud under the wheelarches the following morning, only for it to be 'sparkly and clean like a brand new car' just hours later.\n\nThe court has also heard from a family liaison officer who, having arrived at Lacomba's home in Bazes Shaw as part of the investigation into Miss Wellgreen's disappearance, was told by him to 'come back next week'.\n\nHe was also said to have demanded his phone back from police before they could download its data, and later told his mother Marilyn Lacomba he had subsequently 'chucked it in the river'.\n\nLacomba claimed in his 'missing person's' call to police on October 11 that he had been at home asleep all night on October 9, and woke at 7am the next morning to find she had disappeared.\n\nBut an occupant at the house told police of waking on the night she was allegedly murdered to find both Miss Wellgreen and Lacomba missing.\n\nLacomba was first arrested on suspicion of murder on October 16, and then re-arrested and charged on December 20.\n\nPolice during the search for Ms Wellgreen in Kent last October. She has never been found and prosecutors say she was murdered\n\nThe court heard he was interviewed by detectives on 11 occasions for more than nine hours in total but remained silent throughout.\n\nProsecutor Alison Morgan QC told the jury of eight men and four women at the start of the trial that evidence gathered since the mother's disappearance revealed 'a compelling picture' from which they could be sure of his guilt.\n\nThe court heard Miss Wellgreen split from Shaun Green in 2016 and began dating another man, a football referee called Andy, before meeting Neil James in December that year and moving into his flat in Farnham, Surrey.\n\nBut Lacomba said 'things changed quite dramatically' in May 2018 when Miss Wellgreen said they were having problems and she asked to move back in with him at Bazes Shaw.\n\nDescribing himself as shocked and confused, he told the jury he felt she had done 'a 180' turn.\n\n'She wanted to get back with me, to try and be a couple again...My house was on the market, I had complied with all existing (court) orders.\n\n'In my mind she had managed to get every decision she wanted. To get back with me would mean what was all that for? That's why I was so shocked.'\n\nLacomba said he was not 'a happy person' at the time and needed time to think. However, within days Miss Wellgreen had returned to his home.\n\n'There wasn't a lot to think about. It sounds unbelievable but there wasn't,' he continued. 'If there was any chance we could be a family then I was willing to take that chance.\n\n'First of all it was quite surreal. She moved back in, she seemed really happy and positive.'\n\nLacomba told the court they shared the same bed initially but when Miss Wellgreen tried to become intimate with him, he told her he needed time.\n\n'I said to her 'Can we just take it slowly please?'....Clearly she had just come out of a relationship, we weren't in love at that point, so I felt that to rush things physically would be a mistake.\n\n'I wanted to take time and just get used to a routine and just let things happen naturally rather than trying to force it.'\n\nHe said Miss Wellgreen seemed 'fine' with that but after a couple of days texted him to say their living arrangement was not working 'how she intended it' and suggested they co-parented while leading separate lives.\n\nLacomba described himself as being 'relieved' and 'absolutely comfortable' with that proposed situation.\n\nHe added that arrangement went 'really well', with both agreeing they could see other people as long as it was away from the family home.\n\nBut Lacomba said while he was single, Miss Wellgreen began dating 'straightaway', meeting men on dating apps such as Tinder and Match.com.\n\nHe said he was happy for Miss Wellgreen, and happy to listen when she told him about her dates.\n\nHowever, Lacomba said he was 'quite surprised' when she told him she planned to move back in with Mr James 'given all the things' she had told him about why they split in the first place.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Sarah Wellgreen's former partner Ben Lacomba told Woolwich Crown Court in South East London that he had 'definitely not' killed the 46-year-old beautician, from Kent, whose body has never been found.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19697384-0-image-a-282_1571064899082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
