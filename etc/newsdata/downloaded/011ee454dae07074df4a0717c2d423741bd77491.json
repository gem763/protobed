It grants the government additional powers to restrict citizens\u2019 freedom of movement and their right to assembly. Ominously, soldiers will return to the streets for the first time since an earthquake devastated parts of the country in 2010.\n\nChile students' mass fare-dodging expands into city-wide protest Read more\n\n\u201cThe aim is to ensure public order and the safety of public and private property,\u201d President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era said in a televised address, \u201cThere will be no room for violence in a country with the rule of law at its core.\u201d\n\nOn Friday evening, the palm trees in Santiago\u2019s colonial Plaza de Armas were shrouded in plumes of tear gas thrown by police agents to disperse protesters, and the headquarters of Italian energy company Enel were engulfed in orange flames as the sounds of helicopters and wailing sirens filled the night sky.\n\nAdding to the cacophony was the noise of pots and pans being banged together on balconies, a traditional cacerolazo protest.\n\nPatricia Mu\u00f1oz, Chile\u2019s ombudsperson for the rights of minors, said: \u201cWe are incredibly concerned for the safety of those young people involved in violent confrontations with the police, but the information we are getting from the authorities is one-sided.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chile\u2019s interior minister, Andr\u00e9s Chadwick, gave a brief address outside the nearby presidential palace, La Moneda, in which he confirmed that the government would apply the State Security Law. The legislation \u2013 which separate to the state of emergency \u2013 hands special powers of prosecution to authorities and has been used most frequently in relation to the Mapuche conflict since Chile\u2019s return to democracy in 1990.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Flames engulf the iconic Enel building in downtown Santiago on Friday.

Unsatisfied by partial reforms following widespread education protests in 2011, the metro fare rise has proved the spark that has awoken Chile\u2019s formidable student body, according to psychiatrist and writer Marco Antonio de la Parra.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the past decade, the Chilean state has lost touch with these problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe places that have been targeted tonight are deeply symbolic: transport and energy represent the success of the state and the model it upholds.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn top of social discontent, anger has also been directed at the Carabineros national police force, once one of the country\u2019s most respected institutions but whose reputation has been eroded by corruption scandals and a reputation for brutality, whose heavy-handed repression of protests has also come under the spotlight.\n\n\n\nThe entity that controls the Santiago Metro network has already confirmed that there will be no service over the weekend, and the Chilean student federation has called a nationwide strike for Monday.\n\n\n\n", "description": "President announces order in televised address after fare-dodging protest by students in capital widens", "authors": ["John Bartlett In Santiago"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39b310bc9dd960696767565852898d8fb4d7dec6/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0278f5c79822e2ef2a150a2d5a357839", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
