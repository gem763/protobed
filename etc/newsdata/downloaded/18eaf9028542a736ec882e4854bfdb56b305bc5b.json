(Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post)\n\nFour months after Melanie Proctor\u2019s father was buried with military honors for his combat service in Vietnam, she came home to her farm to find an unfamiliar tan SUV in the driveway.\n\nTwo federal agents stepped out into the hot sun in August 2018. Proctor, a tax preparer, wondered whether one of her clients was in trouble.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here about your father,\u201d the FBI agent said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe he died of natural causes.\u201d\n\nFlipping open a laptop on her kitchen counter, the agents showed Proctor her dad\u2019s records from the three days he had been hospitalized at the local VA medical center.\n\nWhat the line graph showed was alarming.\n\nIn the early morning hours that April, Felix McDermott\u2019s blood sugar had bottomed to dangerous levels. The retired Army sergeant his family knew as \u201cPap\u201d died the next morning from severe hypoglycemia.\n\nSomeone had given her father, who was not a diabetic, a deadly injection of insulin, the investigators told Proctor \u2014 and he was not the only one.\n\nMultiple veterans had died under similar circumstances on the same ward, and the agents had come to Proctor\u2019s farm in a hamlet 42 miles east of Clarksburg to ask the unthinkable: They wanted to dig up Pap\u2019s body.\n\nProctor agreed, and her father was one of seven bodies exhumed in an investigation of 11 suspicious deaths at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center, according to a person familiar with the case who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is ongoing.\n\nThe 14-month inquiry is the latest criminal investigation to engulf the Department of Veterans Affairs, intensifying questions about whether the country\u2019s largest health-care system is doing enough to protect the veterans in its care.\n\nIn August, a former VA pathologist in Fayetteville, Ark., was indicted on three charges of manslaughter after officials say he misdiagnosed thousands of patients while using drugs or alcohol. He has pleaded not guilty. Meanwhile, in Beckley, W.Va., a former VA doctor is under investigation for sexually assaulting as many as 20 of his male patients, according to two people familiar with the case.\n\n[How Veterans Affairs failed to stop a pathologist who misdiagnosed 3,000 cases]\n\nThe cascade of inquiries threatens to undermine trust in the long-troubled agency and undercut President Trump\u2019s promises to reform the far-flung system, the foundation of his pitch to veterans as he runs for reelection.\n\nIn Clarksburg, a small Appalachian community four hours west of Washington, hospital officials said they alerted VA leaders as soon as they learned that their medical staff suspected foul play.\n\n\n\nPins and regimental badges that belonged to Felix McDermott, an Army sergeant who served in Vietnam. (Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe deaths from the second half of 2017 through July 2018, initially found to be of natural causes, are now being investigated as homicides. Federal authorities say they have identified a person of interest in the case.\n\nThe probe has come to focus on a now-fired hospital employee, a woman who worked the overnight shift as a nursing assistant and left last year, according to people familiar with the case.\n\nThe Washington Post is not using the woman\u2019s name because she has not been charged. Through her son, she declined to speak to a reporter who visited her home outside Clarksburg.\n\nThe deaths have set off feverish speculation among local residents and dominated conversation during Tuesday night bingo at the local VFW hall.\n\n\u201cWhen you have someone who is 80-something years old and they had health issues, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018This was their time,\u2019 \u201d said Proctor, 53. \u201cYou don\u2019t question it. None of us had a clue something was wrong.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have identified similarities in nearly a dozen deaths: Elderly patients in private rooms were injected in their abdomen and limbs with insulin the hospital had not ordered \u2014 some with multiple shots, according to people familiar with the case. The insulin, which was quickly absorbed, was given late at night when the hospital staff had emptied out. Within hours, the veterans\u2019 blood-sugar levels plummeted.\n\nThe person of interest was assigned to monitor several of the veterans who died in what are known as one-on-one bedside vigils for patients who need extra attention.\n\nDespite these common denominators, the medical staff and those with oversight of hospital procedures were slow to identify a pattern \u2014 a failure that could have cost lives, several people familiar with the investigation said.\n\nThe Clarksburg medical center reported 26 deaths from late 2017 through June 2018, according to an internal VA database that tracks mortality rates across the system. The suspicious deaths accounted for close to half of them, according to the data reviewed by The Post.\n\nThe case has also brought new scrutiny to VA\u2019s internal controls. The medical surgical ward in Clarksburg, known as 3A, did not have surveillance cameras, according to people familiar with the case. The woman is believed to have had improper access to the medical supply room. The medicine carts on the floor also were routinely left unlocked.\n\nWesley Walls, a hospital spokesman, said the facility has \u201cmany protocols in place to safeguard medication.\u201d\n\nBut lawmakers are still demanding answers.\n\n\u201cAll of us are up in arms,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), describing the reaction of his colleagues on the Senate committee that oversees veterans\u2019 care. He said he is incredulous that hospital leaders in Clarksburg took so long to put the pieces together.\n\n\u201cYou mean to tell me that for nine months you didn\u2019t know what was going on in your hospital?\u201d Manchin said. \u201cEither you didn\u2019t care, or there was a lack of competency.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be this removed\u201d from hospital operations, Manchin said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you don\u2019t give a darn.\u201d\n\nThe senator said he is preparing to call for a \u201cfull-blown\u201d Senate investigation into how VA handled the case.\n\n\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said he wants a Senate investigation into the case. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\n\u201cNone of us had a clue,\u201d Melanie Proctor said of the circumstances surrounding her father\u2019s death. (Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post)\n\nGlenn Snider, the medical center director, has said he notified senior leaders in Washington, including the VA inspector general, as soon as his staff alerted him to their concerns.\n\n\u201cImmediately upon discovering these serious allegations, Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center leadership brought them to the attention of VA\u2019s independent inspector general while putting safeguards in place to ensure the safety of each and every one of our patients,\u201d Walls said in a statement.\n\nThe spokesman declined to provide details but added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that regulations and protocols can only do so much to protect against criminal activity.\u201d\n\nAs the inquiry has unfolded, the hospital has required more rigorous tracking of its medications, including their dispensing and who has access to them, according to people familiar with the case.\n\nVA Inspector General Michael Missal opened an investigation into the deaths in July 2018. The nursing assistant was moved to a dayside paperwork job and interviewed soon after, a person close to the case said. The hospital did not move to fire her for another seven months, the person said, eventually terminating her for lying on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to the families affected by these tragic deaths,\u201d VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in a statement to The Post. He added that the allegations \u201cdo not involve any current\u201d hospital employees, bringing \u201ca small measure of accountability to the situation.\u201d\n\nWilkie also called on Missal, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, to bring to a close the investigation he is jointly leading with the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of West Virginia, a Republican appointed by Trump.\n\n\u201cMore than a year later, the IG is still investigating and Clarksburg-area veterans are still waiting on the justice and answers they deserve,\u201d Wilkie said.\n\nMissal and U.S. Attorney William J. Powell, have said their inquiry is continuing and remains a top priority. They declined to comment.\n\nThree deaths have been ruled homicide by insulin injection, according to people familiar with the investigation. In recent weeks, the Armed Forces deputy medical examiner changed the death certificates of the others from \u201cnatural causes\u201d to \u201cundetermined,\u201d according to autopsy reports and two people familiar with the case.\n\n\n\nThe autopsy report for Felix McDermott, which determined that he died of an injection of unprescribed insulin. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nA possible motive in the deaths is still unclear to investigators. But they say they do not believe they were mercy killings. Although the victims \u2014 all male \u2014 were hospitalized with underlying medical conditions, none was terminally ill.\n\n\u201cI was hoping against hope it was a mercy thing,\u201d Proctor said. \u201cYou can at least wrap your mind around that.\u201d\n\nThe hospital had told McDermott\u2019s family that his aspiration pneumonia was improving with antibiotics and intravenous fluids. They said he would probably be released in a few days once his strength improved, his daughter recalled.\n\n\u201cThey were saying he was doing real good,\u201d she said.\n\nThen her cellphone rang at 1 a.m. April 9. Pap had taken a turn for the worse, the hospital said. His daughter arrived to find him hooked up to an IV bag of dextrose to raise his blood sugar, which had careened to 12 milligrams per deciliter of blood. The normal range in a non-diabetic is 70 to 120, with the low end registering after several hours of not eating.\n\n\u201cThis happens sometimes,\u201d Proctor recalled the staff telling her.\n\nHer father did not recognize her. He died a few minutes before 9 a.m.\n\nMounting deaths\n\n\n\nThe Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center in Clarksburg, W.Va. (Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post)\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s fourth-largest city is set among the hills of a rural region dotted with empty coal fields. VA is a major employer in Clarksburg, but the hospital has struggled to recruit and keep health-care workers to treat its aging veterans, data shows.\n\nThe 70-bed hospital sits high on a bluff at the edge of town, an imposing building of worn, salmon-colored bricks built in 1950, when the mountain hollows here emptied every morning into the coal fields and now-shuttered glass factories. Today many of the 70,000 veterans it serves struggle with chronic disease, including diabetes, local doctors say.\n\nThe first patient afflicted with what would later be understood as sudden, unexplained hypoglycemia died in the second half of 2017.\n\nThe deaths piled up. One in January 2018. Another in March. Three more in April, three days apart, including McDermott. Two more in May. Another two in June. Another in early July, on the same day investigators arrived at the hospital.\n\nThe hospital staff recorded their apparent causes: Advanced dementia, sepsis, heart attack \u2014 unsurprising determinations for an elderly population with chronic conditions, including a small number with diabetes.\n\nThey also had extremely low blood-sugar levels \u2014 some cratering as low as 12 milligrams per deciliter.\n\nA high enough dose of insulin, especially the rapid-acting form, can be fatal for anyone, even with intervention to counteract it.\n\nIt is \u201cvery, very rare\u201d for blood sugar to crater so low that it leads to death, said Yogish C. Kudva, an endocrinologist with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\nTwo months before investigators arrived, on May 7, 2018, a team of inspectors from Missal\u2019s office visited the medical center for an unannounced, week-long spot inspection to conduct a routine review of clinical operations over the past three years.\n\nTheir report issued in October 2018 found general compliance with patient-safety measures, with one exception: The hospital had weak systems for identifying and reporting red flags that could lead to patient harm.\n\nClarksburg officials told the inspectors that during the past three years, there had been no \u201csentinel events,\u201d or episodes of possible lapses in care that harmed patients. But the inspectors identified at least one such case.\n\nThe watchdog\u2019s office was unaware that three weeks earlier, three patients had died under suspicious circumstances \u2014 because no one had identified them, investigators said.\n\nBy mid-2018, a small number of doctors had begun to feel uneasy with the number of patients who had died of sudden hypoglycemia, according to people familiar with the case.\n\nStill, they did not immediately report their concerns.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not looking for sinister things, it\u2019s going to take a while for something like this to come to light,\u201d said a member of the medical staff, describing internal thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s the context in which the hypoglycemia was presented. You\u2019re blind until finally there\u2019s a tipping point.\u201d\n\nThe tipping point came in mid-June, after the death of a Korean War veteran named John Hallman, 87, who served in the Navy. Hallman was admitted with liver issues and possible pneumonia. He died the next morning.\n\nA team of doctors informally discussed the case. They noticed that the overnight staff had checked Hallman\u2019s blood-sugar level. It had dropped to 26.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Who checks the blood sugar on a non-diabetic in the middle of the night while they\u2019re trying to sleep?\u2019 \u201d the medical staffer recalled. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, this is not good.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe doctors emailed a high-ranking supervisor with their concerns. The supervisor forwarded the email to the local quality team for review instead of directly notifying the inspector general\u2019s office, as required by law, according to people familiar with the case.\n\nIt would be 10 more days before Snider, the medical center\u2019s director, would escalate the case to the inspector general and other VA leaders in Washington \u2014 at least nine months after the first death.\n\n'Why is he dying?'\n\n\n\nA cemetery in Westmoreland County, Pa., where Felix McDermott is buried. (Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe hospital had missed other clues. Clarksburg\u2019s mortality statistics, viewed monthly by the quality staff, showed death rates twice as high as similar hospitals in the VA system for the first two quarters of 2018, data reviewed by The Post shows.\n\n\u201cYou had 11 people die. There was a missed pattern,\u201d said House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano (D-Calif.). \u201cIf you\u2019re a manager, you have to understand the warning signs and patterns of behavior.\u201d\n\n[A VA doctor accused of being drunk was charged in 3 deaths. Congress wants to know more.]\n\nTony O\u2019Dell, a Charleston, W.Va, attorney representing several families in wrongful-death cases against VA, said one patient lived independently and was hospitalized after a fall but was about to be discharged.\n\n\u201cMost of these guys were getting better,\u201d O\u2019Dell said. \u201cEach one of these deaths was an opportunity to prevent the next one.\u201d\n\nWhen FBI agents and Missal\u2019s staff arrived on the scene, they pored through patient medical records and began interviewing the staff and the person of interest.\n\nThey discovered that she walked the hospital ward late at night with a bedside glucose meter, pricking the edge of patients\u2019 fingers to test their blood sugar. She pricked one patient 12 times in one night, the person on the medical staff recalled.\n\nAnother night, she told the nurses\u2019 station that a patient\u2019s blood sugar had dropped and that she was finding juice to bring it back up. At the time, her attention to blood-sugar levels did not raise alarms; with West Virginia\u2019s high rate of diabetes, frequent checks are not unusual.\n\nInvestigators have not determined the source of the insulin they believe was used on patients. In some states, including West Virginia, insulin can be purchased without a prescription. At the hospital, the drug, though not a controlled substance, is secured in the medicine room by a coded keypad, according to people familiar with the protocol. However, people familiar with the case said the person of interest obtained access to the room and that medicine carts were often left unlocked.\n\nDetermining who may have accessed the insulin has presented a challenge. The hospital uses surveillance cameras in general areas such as waiting rooms, hallways and parking lots, a spokesman said. VA does not require their use in hospital wards and leaves the decision up to individual facilities.\n\nSoon after they arrived, investigators began knocking on the doors of the victims\u2019 families.\n\nThey drove first to Norma Shaw\u2019s 116-acre farm past a closed coal mine west of town. In March 2018, her husband, George, 81, had shown signs of dehydration and was admitted to the VA hospital. His room was next to the nurses\u2019 station.\n\nAt one point, Shaw, a retired Air Force communications specialist, fell in his hospital room. Then a nurse told his family that George\u2019s blood sugar had dropped. \u201cShe said there was no explanation,\u201d his widow recalled. He died nine days later after being transferred to hospice care, where he alternated between agitation and lethargy.\n\nThe attending doctor urged them to get an autopsy, his family recalled. \u201cWe kept asking: Why is he in hospice?\u201d his daughter, Linda Shaw, recalled. \u201cWhy is he dying?\u201d\n\n\n\nLinda Shaw walks with her mother, Norma, on their farm outside Clarksburg. Norma\u2019s husband George died of a fatal injection of insulin at the local VA hospital. (Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post)\n\nThere was no satisfying answer, they said.\n\nWithout hesi\u00adta\u00adtion, Norma Shaw gave the FBI the go-ahead to exhume his body. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes, take him,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cI just want to know the cause of it.\u201d\n\nIn January, Shaw\u2019s body was taken to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for a forensic autopsy generally performed in cases of violent or suspicious deaths.\n\nThe federal medical examiner found four insulin injection sites in his arms and right thigh. The autopsy showed a blood-sugar drop to 17 in a span of a few hours, according to the family\u2019s attorney, David Glover.\n\nLaid to rest, again\n\n\n\nA portrait of George Nelson Shaw Sr. in his home outside Clarksburg. (Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post)\n\nNorma Shaw displays her anniversary and wedding rings. (Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe insulin deaths have set off rumors and unease in a community where the VA medical center is a local institution.\n\nLinda Shaw, an Air Force veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, has canceled her therapy appointments at the hospital she says she is afraid to enter.\n\n\u201cDo I feel comfortable going there?\u201d she said. \u201cHell no. I do not feel safe there.\u201d\n\nThe hospital \u2014 which had honored the person of interest with an award in 2017 \u2014 moved to fire her in February after discovering that she lied on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 when she was hired in 2014. At the time, she stated she was certified as a nursing assistant, when, in fact, she was not certified, a person close to the investigation said.\n\nShe remained at the hospital, working a day shift until April, when she lost an appeal of her firing.\n\nThe seventh autopsy was completed last month. Although Shaw\u2019s, McDermott\u2019s and one other death have been ruled homicides, the evidence of insulin was not strong enough in the other patients to make that determination, a person close to the investigation said.\n\nAll of the veterans have been reinterred with military funerals.\n\nIn October 2018, Felix McDermott\u2019s gray casket was transported in a hearse back to his grave in Westmoreland County Memorial Park in Pennsylvania.\n\nMelanie Proctor, her husband Dale and their daughter Candy paid their respects once again under a cloudy late-fall sky.\n\nAn honor guard played taps and fired a three-volley funeral salute. The soldiers, at Proctor\u2019s request, slipped six shell casings into the flap of an American flag before presenting it to the family: the first three from his first burial, another three from the second.\n\n\n\nMelanie Proctor holds shell casings from the gun salute following her father\u2019s second funeral.
