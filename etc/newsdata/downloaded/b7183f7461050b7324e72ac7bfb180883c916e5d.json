(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nNot much that wasn\u2019t already evident from their usual activism.\n\nWashington, D.C. \u2014 Where did I leave you? Oh, yes. I was sitting on a wall, waiting for the cops to move, and two men had just finished telling me about the nasty \u201cterfs\u201d (trans-exclusionary radical feminists) who hold the bigoted view that women can\u2019t have penises \u2014 \u201cever!\u201d\n\nAfter the cops gave us the greenlight, the LGBTQ protestors \u2014 accompanied by yours truly \u2013charged down First Street. I never did learn how to count crowds in journalism school, but my guess, as I mentioned earlier, would be that the LGBTQ activists outnumbered the \u201cterfs\u201d & co at a ratio of around ten to one.\n\n\u201cGet out of my face,\u201d I heard one woman, holding a \u201cterf\u201d (\u201cProtect Fairness for Women\u201d) poster, say to a trans activist, who was following her down the street with a megaphone. As everyone gathered outside the court, multiple women, parents, and others took to a miniature stage to speak. They made a number of points, including:\n\nWe will keep fighting for ourselves and we will not back down.\n\nWe can\u2019t let decades of progress be lost in a culture that\u2019s confused. Stand up for women.\n\nSex is binary, and biology is not bigotry.\n\nWe as Americans have to find a way to find some middle ground that respects both sides.\n\nKara Danksy, a feminist from the Women\u2019s Liberation Front, then stood up and read the following message from Julia Long, a feminist \u201cfrom across the pond\u201d in the U.K.:\n\nWe live in dangerous times. We have been sold a lie, a terrible lie \u2014 the lie that a man is a woman if he tells us he is. The lie that a young woman distressed with her own body is somehow really a man. A lie of such magnitude that it is hard to believe that all our major institutions have all been thoroughly complicit in promoting, and indeed enforcing, something so patently untrue and so devasting in its consequences.\n\nAll the while, swarming around them, yelling, tooting, and blasting sirens, were trans activists making counter points:\n\nTrans women are women.\n\nTrans women are women.\n\nTrans women are women.\n\nTrans women are women.\n\nRepetition is their favorite rhetorical trick, which they also applied to the following:\n\nTrans rights are human rights.\n\nWhen trans people are under attack, what do we do? Stand up! Fight back!\n\nHomophobes, go home.\n\nAmidst the noise and rabble were bunch of parents from the non-partisan Kelsey Coalition. This is a parental grassroots organization lobbying for protections for children from the medical harms of transgenderism. They are informed by the principle \u201cFirst do no harm\u201d rather than by any ideology or unifying political perspective. As the group explains on its website:\n\nOur inspiration is the courageous FDA pharmacologist Dr. Frances Kelsey, whose refusal to authorize thalidomide for market use in 1961 prevented thousands of serious birth defects and helped strengthen FDA oversight of the pharmaceutical industry. Dr. Kelsey\u2019s bravery in the face of immense corporate and political pressure has inspired us to speak truth to power, regardless of the personal cost or strength of our opposition.\n\nTwo parents from the group then took the stage to tell their stories, talking over the screaming crowds:\n\nLike any parent, it is hard to believe that my once beautiful, healthy child, now 19 years old, is in and out of homelessness, bearded, her breasts amputated and reproductive organs removed, and living in extreme poverty, all just to be her \u201cauthentic self.\u201d Doctors did this to her while she was still a minor, without my consent or any involvement. My child is mentally ill, no longer thriving, and yet our public schools, government, mental-health professionals, medical doctors, and pharmaceutical companies are telling me what is best for my child and that being opposed to this form of self-actualization is tantamount to abuse.\n\nAnother parent spoke, her voice wavering only slightly:\n\nDid you know that most college students can be prescribed cross-sex hormones while attending school, unknown to their parents? I do. Because Rutgers University medically transitioned my son without my knowledge. Did you know most college health care plans will pay for this? I do. Because the hormones that my son was prescribed cost nothing more than a small co-pay. Advertisement Did you know that schools do not properly assess students before prescribing them these drugs? I do. Because all my son had to do was sign a simple form and go to the pharmacy and start taking the hormones that are wreaking havoc on his body. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know that when you find out that your child\u2019s college is prescribing life-changing hormones, and you try to tell them about your child\u2019s medical history, that they will not care? I do. Because Rutgers transitioned my son even though I begged them to consider underlying health concerns. It is standard medical practice that health histories should be considered before prescribing any drug. \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d\n\nYou may be wondering what any of this has to do with the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, the court heard three cases in relation to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The first two relate to sexual orientation and the third relates to gender identity. In each case, the respective plaintiff claims to have been discriminated against on the basis of being either gay or transgender. In each case, the employer disputes that claim and gives a counter-explanation \u2014 quite apart from identity \u2014 for why they fired their employee. But the question before the Supreme Court is more fundamental than any factual particulars.\n\nThe question is this: What does the law preventing discrimination \u201con the basis of sex\u201d mean by \u201csex\u201d? In other words, by \u201csex,\u201d did the lawmakers mean an anatomical marker observed at birth (male or female), or did they mean it also to extend to a self-declared sexual orientation and gender identity? A natural follow-up question would be: Is it the court\u2019s role to redefine \u201csex\u201d in federal law or to apply a redefinition retroactively?\n\nOf course, the activists, with their megaphones and chants, are not in the least bit interested in what the law \u2014 as written \u2014 says. And neither is the ACLU, which is representing the transgender plaintiff in the gender-identity case Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Speaking outside the Supreme Court, John Bursch, the legal representative for Tom Rost, owner of Harris Funeral Homes, explained:\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s attempt to redefine the word \u201csex\u201d creates unfair situations for women and girls and undermines nearly 50 years of advances for women in this country. In Alaska, city officials tried to force a women\u2019s shelter to allow a man, claiming to be a woman, to sleep in the same room, mere feet away, from women who have been raped, trafficked, and abused. The ACLU endorses that position. In Connecticut, two boys identifying as girls have taken 15 state track-and-field titles in the girls\u2019 division. And do you know what the official said when the mother of one of those girls asked about it? She said girls have the right to participate but not the right to win. That\u2019s unbelievable. The ACLU endorses that position. In this very case Tom [Rost] is being punished for having the audacity to apply a sex-specific dress code based on an employee\u2019s biological sex. Under the ACLU\u2019s position in this case, sex-specific policies of every kind \u2014 whether it\u2019s the shower, the locker room, the sports teams, or the dress codes \u2014 they all have to go. And that is a change that Congress has to make, not the courts.\n\nThe sound of the activists nearly drowned out Bursch\u2019s remarks. One stuck chant with me. It\u2019s the one that simultaneously pretends to demand equal justice under law (as engraved on the front of the Court) while also threatening:\n\nIf we don\u2019t get it \u2014 shut it down.\n\nIf we don\u2019t get it \u2014 shut it down.\n\nWhat did I learn at an LGBTQ rally? Not much that wasn\u2019t already evident from their usual activism. Still, I was reminded that the tyranny of the minority has always been the greatest test of our democratic institutions, that it ought not to be underestimated, and that none of us \u2014 no matter who we are or how fearful we may be \u2014 should ever bow to insolent might.", "description": "The tyranny of the minority has always been the greatest test of our democratic institutions, and it ought not to be underestimated.", "authors": ["Madeleine Kearns", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "A.
