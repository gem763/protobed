What does this mean for those on the front lines?\n\nFor most of the past two decades, American troops have been deployed all over the world\u2014to about 150 countries. During that time, hundreds of thousands of young men and women have experienced combat, and a generation of officers have come of age dealing with the practical realities of war. They possess a deep well of knowledge and experience. For the past three years, these highly trained professionals have been commanded by Donald Trump. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. To get a sense of what serving Trump has been like, I interviewed officers up and down the ranks, as well as several present and former civilian Pentagon employees. Among the officers I spoke with were four of the highest ranks\u2014three or four stars\u2014all recently retired. All but one served Trump directly; the other left the service shortly before Trump was inaugurated. They come from different branches of the military, but I\u2019ll simply refer to them as \u201cthe generals.\u201d Some spoke only off the record, some allowed what they said to be quoted without attribution, and some talked on the record.\n\nSuch rudderless captaincy creates the headlines Trump craves. He revels when his tweets take off. (\u201cBoom!\u201d he says. \u201cLike a rocket!\u201d) Out in the field, where combat is more than wordplay, his tweets have consequences. He is not a president who thinks through consequences\u2014and this, the generals stressed, is not the way serious nations behave. The generals I spoke with didn\u2019t agree on everything, but they shared the following five characterizations of Trump\u2019s military leadership. I. HE DISDAINS EXPERTISE Trump has little interest in the details of policy. He makes up his mind about a thing, and those who disagree with him\u2014even those with manifestly more knowledge and experience\u2014are stupid, or slow, or crazy. As a personal quality, this can be trying; in a president, it is dangerous. Trump rejects the careful process of decision making that has long guided commanders in chief. Disdain for process might be the defining trait of his leadership. Of course, no process can guarantee good decisions\u2014history makes that clear\u2014but eschewing the tools available to a president is choosing ignorance. What Trump\u2019s supporters call \u201cthe deep state\u201d is, in the world of national security\u2014hardly a bastion of progressive politics\u2014a vast reservoir of knowledge and global experience that presidents ignore at their peril. The generals spoke nostalgically of the process followed by previous presidents, who solicited advice from field commanders, foreign-service and intelligence officers, and in some cases key allies before reaching decisions about military action. As different as George W. Bush and Barack Obama were in temperament and policy preferences, one general told me, they were remarkably alike in the Situation Room: Both presidents asked hard questions, wanted prevailing views challenged, insisted on a variety of options to consider, and weighed potential outcomes against broader goals. Trump doesn\u2019t do any of that. Despite commanding the most sophisticated intelligence-gathering apparatus in the world, this president prefers to be briefed by Fox News, and then arrives at decisions without input from others.\n\nOne prominent example came on December 19, 2018, when Trump announced, via Twitter, that he was ordering all American forces in Syria home. \u201cWe have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency,\u201d he tweeted. Later that day he said, \u201cOur boys, our young women, our men, they are all coming back, and they are coming back now.\u201d This satisfied one of Trump\u2019s campaign promises, and it appealed to the isolationist convictions of his core supporters. Forget the experts, forget the chain of command\u2014they were the people who, after all, had kept American forces engaged in that part of the world for 15 bloody years without noticeably improving things. Enough was enough. At that moment, however, American troops were in the final stages of crushing the Islamic State, which, contrary to Trump\u2019s assertion, was collapsing but had not yet been defeated. Its brutal caliphate, which had briefly stretched from eastern Iraq to western Syria, had been painstakingly dismantled over the previous five years by an American-led global coalition, which was close to finishing the job. Now they were to stop and come home? Here, several of the generals felt, was a textbook example of ill-informed decision making. The downsides of a withdrawal were obvious: It would create a power vacuum that would effectively cede the fractured Syrian state to Russia and Iran; it would abandon America\u2019s local allies to an uncertain fate; and it would encourage a diminished ISIS to keep fighting. The decision\u2014which prompted the immediate resignations of the secretary of defense, General James Mattis, and the U.S. special envoy to the mission, Brett McGurk\u2014blindsided not only Congress and America\u2019s allies but the person charged with actually waging the war, General Joseph Votel, the commander of U.S. Central Command. He had not been consulted. Trump\u2019s tweet put General Votel in the position of telling our allies, in effect, We\u2019re screwing you, but we need you now more than ever. Trump\u2019s tweet put Votel in a difficult spot. Here was a sudden 180-degree turn in U.S. policy that severely undercut an ongoing effort. The American contingent of about 2,000 soldiers, most of them Special Forces, was coordinating with the Iraqi army; the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, consisting primarily of Kurdish militias and Syrians opposed to President Bashar al-Assad; and representatives of NATO, the Arab League, and dozens of countries. This alliance had reduced ISIS\u2019s territory to small pockets of resistance inside Syria. America\u2019s troops were deep in the Euphrates Valley, a long way from their original bases of operation. An estimated 10,000 hard-core Islamist soldiers were fighting to the death. Months of tough combat lay ahead.\n\nVotel\u2019s force in Syria was relatively small, but it required a steady supply of food, ammunition, parts, and medical supplies, and regular troop rotations. The avenue for these vital conveyances\u2014through hundreds of miles of hazardous Iraqi desert\u2014was truck convoys, protected almost exclusively by the SDF. To protect its troops during a retreat, America could have brought in its own troops or replaced those truck convoys with airlifts, but either step would have meant suddenly escalating an engagement that the president had just pronounced finished. For the American commander, this was a terrible logistical challenge. An orderly withdrawal of his forces would further stress supply lines, therefore necessitating the SDF\u2019s help even more. Votel found himself in the position of having to tell his allies, in effect, We\u2019re screwing you, but we need you now more than ever. Field commanders are often given orders they don\u2019t like. The military must bow to civilian rule. The generals accept and embrace that. But they also say that no careful decision-making process would have produced Trump\u2019s abrupt about-face. Votel decided to take an exceedingly rare step: He publicly contradicted his commander in chief. In an interview with CNN he said that no, ISIS was not yet defeated, and now was not the time to retreat. Given his responsibility to his troops and the mission, the general didn\u2019t have much choice.\n\nGeneral Joseph Votel and Elizabeth Dent: The danger of abandoning our partners Votel held everything together. He took advantage of the good relationship he had built with the SDF to buy enough time for Trump to be confronted with the consequences of his decision. A few days later, the president backed down\u2014while predictably refusing to admit that he had done so. American forces would stay in smaller numbers (and France and the U.K. would eventually agree to commit more troops to the effort). The 180-degree turn was converted into something more like a 90-degree one. In the end, the main effects of Trump\u2019s tweet were bruising the trust of allies and heartening both Assad and ISIS.\n\nIllustration: Paul Spella; Nicholas Kamm; Olivier Douliery / AFP / Getty; Erik S. Lesser / AP; Kevin LaMarque / Reuters\n\nII. HE TRUSTS ONLY HIS OWN INSTINCTS Trump believes that his gut feelings about things are excellent, if not genius. Those around him encourage that belief, or they are fired. Winning the White House against all odds may have made it unshakable. Decisiveness is good, the generals agreed. But making decisions without considering facts is not. Trump has, on at least one occasion, shown the swiftness and resolution commanders respect: On April 7, 2017, he responded to a chemical-warfare attack by Assad with a missile strike on Syria\u2019s Shayrat Airbase. But this was not a hard call. It was a onetime proportional retaliation unlikely to stir international controversy or wider repercussions. Few international incidents can be cleanly resolved by an air strike. \u201cHow did we even get to that point?\u201d one general asked me in astonishment. What kind of commander in chief would risk war with Iran over a drone? A case in point is the flare-up with Iran in June. The generals said Trump\u2019s handling of it was perilous, because it could have led to a shooting war. On June 20, Iran\u2019s air defenses shot down an American RQ-4A Global Hawk, a high-altitude surveillance drone the Iranians said had violated their airspace. The U.S. said the drone was in international airspace. (The disputed coordinates were about 12 miles apart\u2014not a big difference for an aircraft moving hundreds of miles an hour.) In retaliation, Trump ordered a military strike on Iran\u2014and then abruptly called it off after, he claimed, he\u2019d been informed that it would kill about 150 Iranians. One general told me this explanation is highly improbable\u2014any careful discussion of the strike would have considered potential casualties at the outset. But whatever his reasoning, the president\u2019s reversal occasioned such relief that it obscured the gravity of his original decision.\n\n\u201cHow did we even get to that point?\u201d the general asked me in astonishment. Given what a tinderbox that part of the world is, what kind of commander in chief would risk war with Iran over a drone? Not only would a retaliatory strike have failed the litmus test of proportionality, this general said, but it would have accomplished little, escalated the dispute with Iran, and risked instigating a broad conflict. In an all-out war, the U.S. would defeat Iran\u2019s armed forces, but not without enormous bloodshed, and not just in Iran. Iran and its proxies would launch terrorist strikes on American and allied targets throughout the Middle East and beyond. If the regime were to fall, what would come next? Who would step in to govern a Shiite Muslim nation of 82 million steeped for generations in hatred of America? The mullahs owe their power to the American overthrow of Iran\u2019s elected government in 1953, an event widely regarded in Iran (and elsewhere) as an outrage. Conquering Americans would not be greeted by happy Persian crowds. The generals observed that those who predicted such parades in Baghdad following the ouster of Saddam Hussein instead got a decade-long bloodbath. Iran has more than twice Iraq\u2019s population, and is a far more developed nation. The Iraq War inspired the creation of ISIS and gave renewed momentum to al\u2011Qaeda; imagine how war with Iran might mobilize Hezbollah, the richest and best-trained terrorist organization in the world.\n\nSometimes, of course, war is necessary. That\u2019s why we maintain the most expensive and professional military in the world. But a fundamental reason to own such power is to avoid wars\u2014especially wars that are likely to create worse problems than they solve. General Votel, who commanded American forces in the region until he retired in March, told me that if the U.S. had carried out a retaliatory strike, \u201cthe trick for the military in this case would be to orchestrate some type of operation that would very quickly try and get us to an off-ramp\u2014give them an off-ramp or provide us with an off-ramp\u2014so we can get to some kind of discussion to resolve the situation.\u201d Trump\u2019s attack might have targeted some of the Iranian navy\u2019s vessels and systems that threaten shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, Votel said, or it might have leveled a measured strike against the air defenses that struck the drone. Ideally it would have been followed by a pause, so diplomatic processes could kick in. The strike would have demonstrated to Iran that we have the capability and willingness to strike back if provoked, and made clear that in a serious fight, it could not prevail. But all of this presumes a sequence that would unfold in an orderly, rational way\u2014a preposterous notion. \u201cThis is all completely unpredictable,\u201d Votel said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see how it would play out. We would be compelled to leave large numbers of forces in the region as a deterrent. If you don\u2019t have an off-ramp, you\u2019re going to find yourself in some kind of protracted conflict.\u201d Which is precisely the kind of scenario Trump has derided in the past. His eagerness to free the U.S. from long-term military conflicts overseas was why he made his abrupt announcement about pulling out of Syria. Evidently he didn\u2019t fully consider where a military strike against Iran was likely to lead.\n\nThe real reason Trump reversed himself on the retaliatory strike, one general said, was not because he suddenly learned of potential casualties, but because someone, most likely General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, aggressively confronted him with the extended implications of an attack. \u201cI know the chairman very well,\u201d the general said. \u201cHe\u2019s about as fine an officer as I have ever spent time around. I think if he felt the president was really heading in the wrong direction, he would let the president know.\u201d He added that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo may have counseled against an attack as well. \u201cPompeo\u2019s a really bright guy. I\u2019m sure he would intervene and give the president his best advice.\u201d III. HE RESISTS COHERENT STRATEGY If there is any broad logic to Trump\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s Keep \u2019em confused. He believes that unpredictability itself is a virtue. Keeping an enemy off-balance can be a good thing, the generals agreed, so long as you are not off-balance yourself. And it\u2019s a tactic, not a strategy. Consider Trump\u2019s rhetorical dance with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. No president in modern times has made progress with North Korea. Capable of destroying Seoul within minutes of an outbreak of hostilities, Pyongyang has ignored every effort by the U.S. and its allies to deter it from building a nuclear arsenal. Trump has gone back and forth dramatically on Kim. As a candidate in 2016, he said he would get China to make the North Korean dictator \u201cdisappear in one form or another very quickly.\u201d Once in office, he taunted Kim, calling him \u201cLittle Rocket Man,\u201d and suggested that the U.S. might immolate Pyongyang. Then he switched directions and orchestrated three personal meetings with Kim.\n\n\u201cThat stuff is just crazy enough to work,\u201d one of the generals told me with a what-the-hell? chuckle. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. If they can get back to some kind of discussion, if it can avert something, it will have been worth it. The unconventional aspect of that does have the opportunity to shake some things up.\u201d In the long run, however, unpredictability is a problem. Without a coherent underlying strategy, uncertainty creates confusion and increases the chance of miscalculation\u2014and miscalculation, the generals pointed out, is what starts most wars. John F. Kennedy famously installed a direct hotline to the Kremlin in order to lower the odds of blundering into a nuclear exchange. Invading Kuwait, Saddam Hussein stumbled into a humiliating defeat in the first Gulf War\u2014a conflict that killed more than 100,000 people\u2014after a cascading series of miscommunications and miscalculations led to a crushing international response. From July/August 2017: Mark Bowden on how to deal with North Korea Unpredictability becomes an impediment to success when it interferes with orderly process. \u201cSay you\u2019re going to have an engagement with North Korea,\u201d a general who served under multiple presidents told me. \u201cAt some point you should have developed a strategy that says, Here\u2019s what we want the outcome to be. And then somebody is developing talking points. Those talking points are shared with the military, with the State Department, with the ambassador. Whatever the issue might be, before the president ever says anything, everybody should know what the talking points are going to be.\u201d To avoid confusion and a sense of aimlessness, \u201ceverybody should have at least a general understanding of what the strategy is and what direction we\u2019re heading in.\u201d\n\nWhich is frequently not the case now. \u201cIf the president says \u2018Fire and brimstone\u2019 and then two weeks later says \u2018This is my best friend,\u2019 that\u2019s not necessarily bad\u2014but it\u2019s bad if the rest of the relevant people in the government responsible for executing the strategy aren\u2019t aware that that\u2019s the strategy,\u201d the general said. Having a process to figure out the sequences of steps is essential. \u201cThe process tells the president what he should say. When I was working with Obama and Bush,\u201d he continued, \u201cbefore we took action, we would understand what that action was going to be, we\u2019d have done a Q&A on how we think the international community is going to respond to that action, and we would have discussed how we\u2019d deal with that response.\u201d To operate outside of an organized process, as Trump tends to, is to reel from crisis to rapprochement to crisis, generating little more than noise. This haphazard approach could lead somewhere good\u2014but it could just as easily start a very big fire. If the president eschews the process, this general told me, then when a challenging national-security issue arises, he won\u2019t have information at hand about what the cascading effects of pursuing different options might be. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of shooting blind.\u201d Military commanders find that disconcerting. \u201cThe process is not a panacea\u2014Bush and Obama sometimes made bad decisions even with all the options in front of them\u2014but it does help.\u201d\n\nIllustration: Paul Spella; Eric Thayer / Reuters\n\nIV. \u201cHE IS REFLEXIVELY CONTRARY\u201d General H. R. McMaster, who left the White House on reasonably good terms in April 2018 after only 14 months as national security adviser, is about as can-do a professional as you will find. He appeared to take Trump seriously, and tailored his briefings to accommodate the president\u2019s famous impatience, in order to equip him for the weighty decisions the office demands. But Trump resents advice and instruction. He likes to be agreed with. Efforts to broaden his understanding irritate him. McMaster\u2019s tenure was bound to be short. Weeks before accepting his resignation, the president let it be known that he found McMaster\u2019s briefings tedious and the man himself \u201cgruff and condescending.\u201d\n\nDistrusting expertise, Trump has contradicted and disparaged the intelligence community and presided over a dismantling of the State Department. This has meant leaving open ambassadorships around the world, including in countries vital to American interests such as Brazil, Canada, Honduras, Japan, Jordan, Pakistan, Russia, and Ukraine. High-level foreign officers, seeing no opportunities for advancement, have been leaving. \u201cWhen you lose these diplomats and ambassadors that have all this experience, this language capability, this cultural understanding, that makes things very, very difficult for us,\u201d one of the generals said. \u201cAnd it leads to poor decisions down the line.\u201d Trump so resists being led that his instinct is nearly always to upend prevailing opinion. \u201cHe is reflexively contrary,\u201d another of the generals told me. According to those who worked with him, McMaster avoided giving the president a single consensus option, even when one existed. He has said that he always tried to give the president room to choose. After leaving the White House, he criticized others in the national-security community for taking a different approach, accusing them of withholding information in hopes of steering Trump in the direction they preferred. McMaster has not named names, but he was most likely talking about Mattis and General John Kelly, who, after serving as Trump\u2019s homeland-security secretary, became the president\u2019s second chief of staff. McMaster has said that he considered such an approach tantamount to subverting the Constitution\u2014but if his allegation is true, it shows how poorly equipped those people felt Trump was for the job. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report records numerous instances of civilian advisers trying to manage the president, or simply ignoring presidential directives they deemed ill-advised or illegal.\n\nDuring his brief tenure on Trump\u2019s staff, McMaster oversaw the production of a broad national-security strategy that sought to codify Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d worldview, placing immigration at the head of national-security concerns, right alongside nuclear proliferation and terrorist attacks. The idea was to build a coherent structure around the president\u2019s scattershot diplomacy. Trump rhapsodized about the document at its unveiling, according to someone who was there, saying, \u201cI love it! I love it! I want to use this all the time.\u201d He hasn\u2019t. Like its author, the document has been dismissed. Those who were involved in writing it remain convinced, somewhat hopefully, that it is still helping guide policy, but John Bolton, McMaster\u2019s successor, said scornfully\u2014a few months before he, too, was ousted by Trump\u2014that it is filed away somewhere, consulted by no one. Trump is no more likely to have read the thing than he is to have written his own books. (Years ago, after he published The Art of the Deal, he asked me if I was interested in writing his next book. I declined.) Trying to shape this president\u2019s approach to the world into a cogent philosophy is a fool\u2019s errand. For those commanding America\u2019s armed forces, it\u2019s best to keep binoculars trained on his Twitter feed. V. HE HAS A SIMPLISTIC AND ANTIQUATED NOTION OF SOLDIERING Though he disdains expert advice, Trump reveres\u2014perhaps fetishizes\u2014the military. He began his presidency by stacking his administration with generals: Mattis, McMaster, Kelly, and, briefly, Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser. Appointing them so soon after their retirement from the military was a mistake, according to Don Bolduc, a retired brigadier general who is currently running as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire. Early on, the biggest difference Bolduc saw between the Trump administration and its predecessors, and one he felt was \u201cgoing to be disruptive in the long term,\u201d was \u201cthe significant reliance, in the Pentagon at least, on senior military leadership overriding and making less relevant our civilian oversight. That was going to be a huge problem. The secretary of defense pretty much surrounded himself with his former Marine comrades, and there was, at least from that group, a distrust of civilians that really negatively affected the Pentagon in terms of policy and strategy in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, by following the same old failed operational approaches.\u201d Trump\u2019s reliance on military solutions is problematic because \u201cthere are limits to what the military can solve. I think initially the Trump administration held this idea that general officers somehow have all the answers to everything. I think the president discovered in short order that that\u2019s really not the case.\u201d\n\nBolduc also pointed out an unusual leadership challenge caused by having a general of McMaster\u2019s rank serve as national security adviser\u2014he did not retire when he assumed the post. \u201cMcMaster, for whom I have tremendous respect, came in as a three-star general. Leaving him a three-star forces him on a daily basis to have to engage with four-star generals who see his rank as beneath theirs, even though his position is much more than that.\u201d The problems posed by Trump\u2019s skewed understanding of the military extend beyond bad decision making to the very culture of our armed forces: He apparently doesn\u2019t think American soldiers accused of war crimes should be prosecuted and punished. In early May, he pardoned former Army Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who had been convicted of murdering an Iraqi prisoner. Two weeks later, he asked the Justice Department to prepare pardon materials for a number of American servicemen and contractors who were charged with murder and desecration of corpses, including Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who stood accused by his own team members of fatally stabbing a teenage ISIS prisoner and shooting unarmed civilians. (He was ultimately acquitted of the murders but convicted of posing for photos with the boy\u2019s body.) Trump subsequently chastised the military attorneys who had prosecuted Gallagher, and directed that medals awarded to them be rescinded. All of the generals agreed that interfering with the military\u2019s efforts to police itself badly undermines command and control. When thousands of young Americans are deployed overseas with heavy weaponry, crimes and atrocities will sometimes occur. Failing to prosecute those who commit them invites behavior that shames everyone in uniform and the nation they serve.", "description": "The commander in chief is impulsive, disdains expertise, and gets his intelligence briefings from Fox News.
