According to multidisciplinary designer, Roya Aghighi, this \u201cpassive act\u201d of consumption prevents us from engaging with what we wear so that we don\u2019t notice the incredible amount that we neglect and waste.\n\nThe designer alongside a care label that explains how to care for her living clothing. Roya Aghighi\n\n\u201cClothing is the closest object to our body yet the only times we are conscious about it is at the beginning of the day when we choose what to wear or when we spill coffee on it,\u201d Aghighi says.\n\nMaterials, she reveals, are the key to changing how we interact with everyday items like clothing and revolutionary changes could shape our experiences for the better. \u201cMy approach to bio-design goes beyond only considering it as problem solving,\u201d she tells Euronews Living, instead she focuses on how the design process can be rebuilt from the bottom up to make us rethink these wasteful habits and behaviours.\n\nRead More | This expo is uniting designers with thousands of responsibly sourced materials\n\nWhat if what you wore was alive?\n\nThis is where \u201cbiogarmentary\u201d comes in. A \u201cvision of the future\u201d, Aghighi\u2019s innovative project presents items of clothing constructed from a material that photosynthesises. Created in collaboration with the Materials Experience Lab and scientists from the University of British Columbia, the textile is made from a combination of natural fibre based fabrics and living photosynthetic cells. These single-celled, green algae, could even purify the air around you as they \u201cbreathe\u201d.\n\nThis thought-provoking approach goes beyond providing a sustainable fashion solution, however. Unique care instructions require wearers to form a more complex relationship with Aghighi\u2019s clothing than with their usual cotton jacket.\n\nThe biogarmentry jackets are part of a proof of concept for this innovative material. Roya Aghighi\n\n\u201cIn taking care of the current biotextile which is made out of Algae, users need to be aware of the fact that they don\u2019t need to wash their clothes,\u201d she says, \u201cThey could simply submerge the living textile into water when the textile requires to be washed which will provide the cells with necessary water\u201d. The material also loves light meaning that shoving it to the back of the cupboard won\u2019t do it any favours.\n\n\u201cClose your eyes for a moment and imagine the clothes you are wearing right now are alive,\u201d she says, \u201cWith that thought, your interaction with your daily clothes would imminently change. You are less likely to throw your clothes in a dark closet or washing machine. It could even make users more conscious about daily choices as simple as where is safe to sit, or if you knew your garment could feed off your sweat would that encourage you to exercise more?\u201d\n\nThe biogarmentry needs to be watered to keep it alive Roya Aghighi\n\nCaring for your clothing\n\nIf biogarmentry were a widespread thing, whether or not your clothing survived would be directly related to the attention you give it. Through increasing care and awareness of its needs a transformation of values would occur that could help reduce waste by changing our perception of textiles. Aghighi hopes this project will inspire a shift in perception surrounding clothing implementing what the designer calls a \u201cdeeper, more holistic idea of change\u201d.\n\nBiogarmentry allows its owner to form a more intimate relationship with their clothing to transform attitudes of \"buy, use and dispose\" to \"buy, care for and compost\". Although it is only a proof of concept for the new material, it raises clear questions about how we interact with what we wear.\n\n\u201cIn other words, biogarmentry aims to utilize humans emotional attachments to living creatures to bring the lost value and agency back to textiles and clothing consumption,\u201d she says, \u201cIt challenges our current relationship to clothing while acting as a catalyst for behavioural change.\u201d\n\nRead More | The sustainable accessories coming to life on Kickstarter this autumn\n\nA shift away from our current consumerist attitude is desperately needed. Instead of buying in line with constantly changing kaleidoscope of fashions, longevity needs to be higher up on our list of desirable characteristics. \u201cIn the current fashion industry more than 90% of clothes don\u2019t even reach their mid-way potential,\u201d Aghighi explains, \u201c Most clothes find their way into landfill after only second or third wear.\u201d In the UK this amounts to around \u00a3140 million worth of clothing being thrown away each year with \u00a330 million hidden away unused in wardrobes, according to WRAP.\n\nAghighi is confident that design using innovative materials is the best way to inspire this much-needed change. \u201cI believe that no change will happen until we shift our fundamental beliefs and habits. I see materials as building blocks of the design process which could have an invaluable impact on human interactions with their surroundings.\u201d\n\nBy challenging how we currently view clothing, Aghighi hopes that this project could be an inspiring catalyst for behavioural change to support a more sustainable culture. Inspired by an incredible disconnect, biogarmentry represents a radical future that could help solve fashion's growing problem with pollution and waste.", "description": "Roya Aghighi's biogarmentry is made from cells that photosynthesise as you wear them.", "authors": ["Rosie Frost"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/83/64/1000x563_cmsv2_15e5b80d-e30e-51e4-a2d1-8933ecd44546-4248364.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
