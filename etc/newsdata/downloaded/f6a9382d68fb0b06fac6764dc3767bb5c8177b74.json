That\u2019s right, you can get a kit delivered to your door so you can do all the fiddly bits yourself. Easy\u2026right?\n\nAre home STI tests free?\n\nDepending on your age and/or the area you live, you may be eligible for a free home test kit for certain STIs.\n\nYour best bet is to see if you live in one of the 20 areas currently serviced by SH:24 (a sexual health organisation working in partnership with the NHS) or Google \u2018free home STI test [insert your hometown here]\u2019 to see what\u2019s available in your area.\n\nCertain areas also offer free chlamydia testing kits for those under 25 \u2013 see if you\u2019re eligible through the NHS.\n\nIf you don\u2019t qualify for a freebie, don\u2019t despair \u2013 you can buy one from a private company such as Fettle (the paid-for version of SH:24), Zava or Lloyds Pharmacy.\n\nWhen should I not take a home STI test? SH:24 advises going straight to the clinic if one or more of the following applies to you: You have been sexually assaulted\n\nYou are a man who has sex with men and have had unprotected sex in the last three days\n\nYou have any symptoms, for example itchiness, soreness, redness, unusual discharge or lumps/sores.\n\nYou are a woman and have had unprotected sex in the last five days and think you are at risk of being pregnant\n\nYou are under the age of 16\n\nHow does self-testing work?\n\nThe Zava basic STI test for women (Picture: Zava)\n\nI tried the Zava basic STI test for women, \u00a3122.99, which checks for gonorrhea (vaginal, anal and oral), chlamydia (vaginal, anal and oral), HIV and syphilis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had to fill out an initial questionnaire so a Zava doctor could prescribe the kit for me. It got approved and sent out the same day, arriving at my door a few days later in very discreet packaging (you can also pay extra for next day delivery).\n\nMy kit contained three swabs (one for my mouth, vagina and anus) and a blood collection kit, along with detailed instructions on what to do with it all.\n\nThe swabbing was easy \u2013 you\u2019ve just got to be comfortable inserting swabs inside yourself \u2013 and taking your own blood sounds scary but it\u2019s pretty stress-free.\n\nThose with needle phobias can breathe easy as blood is collected used a spring-loaded, single-use lancet.\n\nI recommend soaking your finger in warm water for a few minutes prior to blood collection to make it more comfortable. The first time I took my own blood I failed to do this and it was sore \u2013 I can confirm the warm water soaking makes it much less painful.\n\nI find it easier when I whack on loud music, take a deep breath and press the lancet in on a heavy beat.\n\nSwabs are popped into containers (make sure you label these correctly) and put safely into the return box along with the blood sample, and posted to Zava using the pre-paid envelope.\n\nWhichever type of kit you use, make sure you read the instructions carefully before starting as some companies require you to do the test on certain days of the week/times of day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZava has doctors working seven days a week so it doesn\u2019t matter what day you post your kit off, but other companies may only have doctors available Monday to Friday. This means if you post your bodily juices off on a Friday they\u2019ll be left festering all weekend, rendering them unusable.\n\nI dropped my samples off to the postbox on a Friday afternoon for the evening collection, and got my results back the following Tuesday by way of an email telling me to log into my Zava account.\n\nYou\u2019ll be pleased to hear I tested negative for everything. I celebrated by having unprotected sex with a stranger.\n\n(I joke, I joke)\n\nHow do I know if my kit is legit?\n\nAny kit obtained via the NHS will be of high quality, but what if you don\u2019t qualify for an NHS kit and need to buy one from a private company?\n\nYour first port of call should be checking that the kit you\u2019re about to buy has a CE quality assurance mark, and is licensed for sale in the UK.\n\n\u2018Not all companies that are producing these kits have fully calibrated equipment which is approved by a CE mark for medical devices, known as a MDD or MDR,\u2019 says Dr Asif Munaf, founder of home blood testing and IV company Endorance.\n\n\u2018Make sure the kit you use has the CE mark so you can some sense of trust that the device will be reading what is supposed to be reading.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may have to contact the company directly to enquire about the CE mark. Zava, for example confirmed that while their kit isn\u2019t CE marked, all the components of it are.\n\nThe NHS recommends checking that your self-test kit is sealed, without damage to the packaging, and within its expiry date.\n\nIf you have concerns about the quality of a self-test kit, report it via the Yellow Card Scheme.\n\nIs home STI testing as accurate as going to the clinic?\n\nTalk to your doctor if you have any symptoms (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe\u2019ve established that home STI testing is easy, but is it as accurate as getting your bits out at the clinic?\n\nResearch shows that self-tests are as accurate as their clinician counterparts. However the NHS states that \u2018no self-test is 100% reliable\u2019. In fact, no STI test is 100% accurate, including those done at the clinic.\n\nTo ensure a higher rate of accuracy, ensure you follow the instructions carefully e.g. providing enough blood, swabbing all required areas of your mouth for the advised length of time.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that there\u2019s a \u2018window period\u2019 for certain infections between catching them and them showing up in a test.\n\nChlamydia and gonorrhea can take up to two weeks, HIV up to four weeks, and syphilis up to 12 weeks.\n\nWhat happens if a result comes back positive?\n\nFor certain infections such as chlamydia, medication can be prescribed and posted to you (for a fee if via a private service).\n\nFor infections such as HIV, syphilis or Hepatitis B or C, a clinician will contact you and advise on your next steps, which will usually involve visiting a clinic, and seeking emotional support.\n\nHome STI tests make it easier for you to bury your head in the sand if you receive a positive result, but it\u2019s important not to for both your physical and mental wellbeing.\n\n\u2018The use of home kits often mean users don\u2019t seem medical help which they ought to even if they have suspicion of an STD with tell-tale symptoms such as burning when urinating, skin discoloration and changes and foul-smelling discharge,\u2019 explains Dr Munaf.\n\n\u2018This can not only make the infection worse it can spread it to other people the person comes into contact with.\u2019\n\nWhile home STI testing can be expensive if you don\u2019t qualify for a free one, studies have shown that offering young people a home test kit almost doubles uptake than if they are offered a test at the clinic.\n\nHowever you choose to do it, just make sure you get regularly tested (at least once a year) and that you act on the results.\n\n\u2018My advice is that if you have suspicion of STD than go to seek medical help preferably via your GP or walk-in sexual health clinic,\u2019 says Dr Munaf.\n\n\u2018If that\u2019s not possible, then at the very least buy your kit from a company that has doctors who analyse your results.\u2019\n\nMORE: There is officially no such thing as a 'normal' vagina\n\nMORE: What happens at a smear test and how to prepare for one\n\nMORE: I did a DIY blood test to confirm if I was healthy or rotting on the inside\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Everything you need to know about testing yourself for STIs and STDs at home.", "authors": ["Lisa Bowman"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/modern-etiquette-why-are-you-so-nervous-about-pooing-at-work-3a50_1570186683.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
