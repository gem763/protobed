And last night her third film, Saint Maud, directed by newcomer Rose Glass, received a prestigious special commendation in the festival\u2019s annual awards.\n\nThe judges announced on Saturday night that the overall winner in the best film category was Alejandro Landes\u2019s acclaimed thriller Monos, a gripping portrayal of the lives of child soldiers. Yet they also took time to heap praise on Saint Maud, with the official competition jury president Wash Westmoreland declaring: \u201cThis dazzling directorial debut marks the emergence of a powerful new voice in British cinema.\u201d\n\nClark, who grew up in Cardiff, plays the lead character in the psychological horror film, which tells the story of a troubled carer who becomes disturbingly fixated on the life of her latest charge, an ageing dancer.\n\nThe actress, who is perhaps best known for her stage appearance as Cordelia at the Old Vic opposite Glenda Jackson\u2019s acclaimed King Lear, could also be seen at the festival in Eternal Beauty, a comedy drama from Craig Roberts, starring Sally Hawkins. She also amused audiences with her performance as Dora, David Copperfield\u2019s vapid first wife in Armando Iannucci\u2019s adaptation of the novel, chosen as the opening gala premiere. Clark could also be spotted by the keener-eyed critics playing Copperfield\u2019s widowed mother in the same film.\n\nAs Dora, Clark had to perform with a lap dog which often threatened to upstage her on the set, the actress has claimed. \u201cWe\u2019d occasionally do a scene, and people would be laughing their heads off, and I was like, \u2018I must have been really bloody funny\u2019, but Armando would come over, [and say] \u2018Sorry, Scampy was hilarious.\u2019 It was the dog!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Clark appeared in Carol Morley\u2019s boarding school drama The Falling, and she also played the daughter of Kate Beckinsale\u2019s Lady Susan Vernon in Whit Stillman\u2019s 2016 film, Love & Friendship.\n\nBorn in Sweden, where her father was working, Clark and her family returned to Wales when she was seven, where she was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). Concentrating, she has since explained, is always much easier for her when she is performing.\n\nIn this, the 63rd BFI London Film Festival, more than 60% of the films shown in competition were made by a female director or co-director, with producers from 16 countries represented.\n\nTricia Tuttle, the festival\u2019s director, said on Saturday: \u201cOur awards highlight the most distinctive, urgent and accomplished filmmaking from around the globe, and it has been an incredible festival. Audiences have been moved, provoked and dazzled by these films, many of which engage with pressing social and political themes in very inventive ways.\u201d\n\nMonos, the winning film, has been described as \u201challucinogenic and intoxicating\u201d, and has earned comparisons to Apocalypse Now. estival judges in London hailed it as a masterpiece, while also praising an American film, Alma Har\u2019el\u2019s Honey Boy. Other winners were Mati Diop\u2019s Atlantics, which scooped the Sutherland Award for a first feature, the documentary on the 1970s Rock Against Racism movement,White Riot, which claimed the Grierson Award, and the Japanese short film, Fault Line.", "description": "Welsh actress, star of Saint Maud, takes the London Film Festival by storm, as Monos claims best film", "authors": ["Vanessa Thorpe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439c1631285364d8ce45e2122d47c5abce5c7e64/133_86_4795_2877/master/4795.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8189494d354cbe365e57f814c4a8b3d3", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
