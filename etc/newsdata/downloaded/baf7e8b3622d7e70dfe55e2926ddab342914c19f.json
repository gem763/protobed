He has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder\n\nPolice said Santos, who they say is also homeless, underwent a psychiatric evaluation ahead of his arraignment.\n\nAccording to his social media accounts, Santos is believed to have a young son but it is not clear if he has custody.\n\nHis Facebook profile image features the cover of a book written by evangelist Billy Graham and is based on the key to personal peace. His Facebook introduction translates to 'I am the tranquil type, there is no game'.\n\nSantos has also previously commented about knowing one of the men involved in a brutal killing outside a Bronx bodega and suggested the killer should rot in prison for his crimes.\n\nHe has been arrested at least a half-dozen other times in the past two years and three of those times were on assault charges.\n\nThe suspect's mother, Fioraliza Rodriguez, 55, told the New York Daily News she had kicked him out about three years ago.\n\nShe said he struggled with drugs, assaulted her and his grandfather, and stole from the family.\n\nThe NYPD released this photo showing the piece of metal that Santos allegedly used to beat to death four sleeping homeless men early Saturday\n\nSantos, 24, was taken into custody early Saturday morning following the bloody killing spree in Manhattan's Chinatown\n\n'I never thought he would kill someone,' she said. 'I was afraid of him, though, because he punched me. That's when I told him to get out of my house.'\n\nFamily members told the newspaper that Santos started using drugs when he arrived from their native Dominican Republic about four years ago.\n\n'When I told him to leave, he came back and threatened me,' the suspect's mother said.\n\n'He said when I go back to Santo Domingo, he'll get people to cut my face.'\n\nThe attack Santos is suspected of carrying out early Saturday left four men dead and another homeless man with serious injuries.\n\nThe victims, all men, were attacked as they slept in doorways and sidewalks in three different locations in Chinatown, which is packed during daylight hours but empties out at night.\n\nPolice responded to a 911 call just before 2am as one assault was in progress.\n\nThey found one man dead in the street and a second with critical head injuries. A search of the neighborhood turned up three additional bodies.\n\nHis Facebook profile image features the cover of a book written by evangelist Billy Graham and is based on the key to personal peace\n\nPolice officers escort Randy Rodriguez Santos from the 5th Precinct to a vehicle bound for a hospital for evidence collection on Saturday\n\nPolice said they recovered the weapon, which was still in the suspect's hands, when Santos was arrested.\n\nAn 83-year-old man named Cheun Kok was among those killed. He was sleeping at the intersection of Bowery and Doyers streets when he was fatally attacked.\n\nThe identities of the other victims have not been released.\n\nTwo of the men were killed on The Bowery, which cuts through the heart of Chinatown and has for decades been known as New York's skid row. Two more died on East Broadway, the neighborhood's main street.\n\nThe lone known survivor was hospitalized in critical condition. Police planned to interview him as soon as possible.\n\nAnother homeless man who had slept in the area, Stephen Miller, said he knew one of the victims as kind and quiet.\n\n'No one knew him by name, but we saw him every day,' Miller said.\n\n'At this point, I'm just sad. This guy never did anything. Just had a life to live. It sucks that he's out here in the rain and everything, but it doesn't mean he doesn't have a life to live.'\n\nTwo of the men were killed on The Bowery.

In the past five years, an average of seven have been slain each year.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio launched new homeless outreach efforts early in his tenure in an attempt to move more people off the street and into shelters, but the program has faced challenges. City efforts to build more homeless shelters have dragged due to neighborhood opposition.\n\nDe Blasio tweeted Saturday that he's 'stunned and horrified by this senseless act of violence against the most vulnerable members of our community'.\n\nThe attacks happened in one of the few downtown Manhattan areas that has retained its character as a center for new immigrants, through gentrification has started to creep in lately.\n\nDuring the day, it bustles with small shops, restaurants and markets doing business in Chinese, as a mix of residents and tourists pack the sidewalks. At night it can be desolate in some sections.", "description": "Randy Rodriguez Santos, 24, had been charged with four counts of murder after being taken into custody early Saturday morning following the bloody killing spree in Manhattan's Chinatown.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/18/19366316-0-image-a-48_1570382019035.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
