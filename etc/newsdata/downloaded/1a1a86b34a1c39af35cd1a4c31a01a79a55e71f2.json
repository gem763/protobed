In a video released Monday, Hill said she was stepping down because she was \u201cfearful of what might come next\u201d following the online publication of explicit pictures that outed her relationship with a female staffer.\n\nSex scandals are nothing new in national politics and have mostly centered on men, some of whom have weathered the controversy and gone on to have successful careers. One of Hill\u2019s congressional colleagues, Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, is running for reelection despite being charged with using campaign funds to finance romantic flings with lobbyists and congressional aides.\n\nThat\u2019s prompted some to question why Democrats supported Hill\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cSome of her behavior, if a man did it, we would say it was wrong and inappropriate. But she is being held to a different standard,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nHill acknowledged the relationship with the campaign aide after private photos of her with the woman were posted online, first by a conservative website. Hill said the relationship was consensual and blamed her estranged husband for revealing the information. Hill and her husband are in the midst of an acrimonious divorce.\n\nHill has denied another allegation that she was having an affair with a male congressional adviser, a relationship that would have run afoul of House rules put in place last year that ban any relationship between lawmakers and staff. Those rules were enacted following a string of misconduct allegations involving male colleagues.\n\nThe House opened an ethics investigation into the allegations about Hill, but the California Democrat announced her resignation within days of the committee launching the probe.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who had tapped Hill for a coveted leadership post after she unseated a Republican in the suburban Los Angeles swing district, called her continued service \u201cuntenable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces,\u201d Pelosi said Sunday in a statement.\n\nHill\u2019s defenders say she is the victim in this situation, given the publication of private photos that exposed her relationship.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s under attack by a vengeful ex and an opportunistic media, and a society that \u2026 is all too eager for a woman to be taken down, and quote-unquote \u201c#MeToo-ed,\u201d said New York lawyer Carrie Goldberg, who often represents victims of such attacks. \u201cThis is not a #MeToo situation.\u201d\n\nThe #MeToo movement felled a half-dozen lawmakers last year for a range of offenses. But not all who faced misconduct allegations resigned from office.\n\nHunter, a San Diego Republican, resisted calls to resign even after his indictment, which he calls politically motivated. Former Nevada Democratic congressman Ruben Kihuen served out his first term despite a 2018 ethics probe that upheld three credible reports of sexual harassment. He ran unsuccessfully this year for a Las Vegas City Council seat.\n\nTiffany Barnes, an associate professor at the University of Kentucky, said her research has shown that certain voters are more critical of women involved in sex scandals. Those who hold \u201chostile sexist attitudes,\u201d and believe women have progressed too far in society, are less likely to reelect a female candidate following a sex scandal than a man, her 2014 research found.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a backlash effect,\u201d Barnes said Monday.\n\nHill\u2019s situation also raises questions about what the future holds in an era where more people who came of age in the iPhone era are being elected to political office.\n\n\u201cThe future has to be more accepting,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be without politicians if we become so prudish about their sexuality becoming public.\u201d\n\nHill, describing herself as the \u201cimperfect\u201d daughter of a nurse and a police officer, expressed that very fear Monday as she vowed to fight the growing tide of online harassment against women. She is divorcing Kenneth Heslep, who in court papers described himself as a house husband being rejected by an ambitious wife. His lawyer did not immediately return a call for comment Monday.\n\n\u201cI will not allow my experience to scare off other young women or girls from running for office,\u201d Hill said in the video. \u201cWe cannot let that happen.\u201d", "description": "The resignation of a female Democratic congresswoman over a consensual, sexual relationship with a campaign aide has sparked questions about whether women", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/ceabc8_congresswoman-resigns-10407-katie-hill-in-nov-2018-file-photo-katie-hill-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
