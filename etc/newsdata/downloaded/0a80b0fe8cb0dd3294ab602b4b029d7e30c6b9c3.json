Suppose a political opponent committed murder, what are we going to do? He\u2019s a political opponent, so you\u2019re not going to investigate him? The fact is this is not a political opponent. It didn\u2019t start that way\u2026 The reality is this Biden stuff, I\u2019ve known it for six months, I started this investigation long before he was a candidate. I started it in November of 2018, solely for one single purpose, because I\u2019m his defense lawyer and it exonerates him. It shows there was a lot more collusion in Ukraine than in Russia and that Joe Biden materially assisted in getting some of that covered up, and also, by the way, got his son out and got a five billion dollar crooked oligarch free who is now running around Ukraine thanking Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On this weekend's broadcast of Fox News's \"Media Buzz,\" President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Trump had \"every right\" to ask other countries to help him investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Rudy-Giuliani-angry-upclose-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
