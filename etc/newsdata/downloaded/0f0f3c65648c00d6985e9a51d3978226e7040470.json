Those companies, such as Comcast, Charter and Dish, all take a chunk of revenue for providing \u2014 and often promoting \u2014HBO.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese are companies AT&T does not own. And they\u2019re companies that have a vested interest in not shifting their consumers over to HBO Max. Why would they? They don\u2019t stand to take in any of the dollars once that happens.\n\nA Comcast representative and a Charter representative, the company\u2019s two biggest cable providers, would not comment.\n\nAnalysts, however, were plenty verbose.\n\n\u201cThe existing [traditional] subscribers \u2013 do you need to go back and reopen their current...agreements?\" John Hodulik of UBS asked executives after the presentation.\n\n\u201cSo I sign up for HBO Max on Comcast or Charter\u2019s Spectrum\u2026how does that sausage all work?\u201d queried Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners.\n\nAD\n\nTheir meaning: Sure, all these conversions are not a problem when it comes to subscribers of DirectTV, which AT&T owns, or the existing HBO Now. HBO said it will let them switch right away, and why not? The money\u2019s going into the same corporate pocket.\n\nAD\n\nBut what about everyone else? Why would those companies help in this effort? They would, if anything, have motive to stop subscribers from switching to HBO Max.\n\nHBO sought to downplay these concerns.\n\n\u201cWe are in active discussions with our distributors. The intent is indeed to get these existing 30-plus million consumers access to HBO Max as quickly as we possibly can,\u201d said Tony Goncalves of Warner subsidiary Otter Media, who has been tasked with the effort.\n\nAD\n\nAn FAQ on HBO Max\u2019s site played things equally close to the vest.\n\nTo the question of what happens if you subscribe through a (non-AT&T) provider, it offered \u201cIf you subscribe to HBO through a cable or TV provider, stay tuned for more details as we get closer to our launch date.\u201d\n\nSo how would this seemingly irresolvable stalemate play out?\n\nAD\n\nIn one scenario HBO would have to pay an enormous sum for these providers to facilitate an HBO Max transition, something WarnerMedia would decidedly not want to do for a service that\u2019s already costing it as much as $2 billion more a year with no timeline for profitability. The whole point of streaming, after all, is to reduce the payout to distributors.\n\nAD\n\nIn another scenario, HBO actually would have to go to war with its own distributors \u2014 target people currently paying Comcast or Spectrum for HBO and woo them away. Not exactly likely or ideal, since for the foreseeable future it\u2019s still getting tens of millions of subscribers through these companies.\n\nIn yet another scenario, HBO could raise the price of Max for non-AT&T customers so there\u2019s enough money to go around to the Charters and Comcasts of the world too. That\u2019s equally unpalatable given that HBO Max is already priced higher than every other large streaming service.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWarnerMedia is caught between a rock and a hard place,\u201d veteran L.A.-based investor Lloyd Greif said. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly competitive space and it\u2019s not called the streaming wars for nothing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAll of this highlights a key problem in those wars and the legacy companies that want to do battle in them. A firm like WarnerMedia wants to reach consumers directly \u2014 the technology allows it, the revenue is better with it, and Wall Street loves it.\n\nBut it still does business with the traditional distributors. (A lot of business \u2014 of the 50 million subscribers to HBO Max it forecasts for 2025, about two-thirds will be existing HBO subscribers, many of whom get the service through these distributors.)\n\nAnd that makes for a difficult problem: a company trying to get into distribution at the same time as it needs distributors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic and hopeful we\u2019ll open up the deals and be able to do something proactively,\u201d WarnerMedia chief executive John Stankey said Tuesday of the distributor relationships. Then he cautioned, \u201cObviously it takes two parties to [make a change].\u201d\n\nAnd one of those parties may be wondering exactly why it should.\n\nAD", "description": "Why AT&T could run into some real challenges getting us the service", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OVQBqTQKlDEnFUY5nuYVeoeon_A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QZ4AYCX3AQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
