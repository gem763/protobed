Don't drink lemon juice first thing in the morning\n\nIf you're following health trends, you'll know starting the day with a glass of warm water and lemon is a must.\n\nHowever, citrus fruit or drinks like kombucha, apple cider vinegar and sports drinks can harm your teeth as the high acidity level can destroy the enamel.\n\n'Exposing the dentin (dense bony tissue forming the bulk of a tooth underneath the enamel) is bad news as that can lead to tooth sensitivity and discolouration,' Dr Verdian said.\n\n'After consuming acidic foods, rinse your mouth with water and avoid brushing your teeth for 30 minutes so the enamel has time to re-calcify.'\n\nAdditionally, minimise damage by using a straw.\n\nLemon and water is a popular morning tonic, however, unless you drink it through a straw the acidity of the fruit can damage your tooth enamel (stock image)\n\n2. Take inspiration from celebrities\n\nWhen it comes to 'teeth makeovers', don't be afraid to turn to celebrities for inspiration.\n\nAccording to Dr Verdian, the smiles of Blake Lively and Candice Swanepoel are two of the most highly requested celebrities women consistently seek to emulate.\n\n'New digital scanning technology means we can copy their fabulous smile with extreme accuracy,' he said.\n\n'It means we can tailor the veneers to the patient's preferred shape and length, and to suit their face shape and smile before we even touch the teeth.'\n\n3. Don't rely on charcoal toothpaste or baking soda\n\nCharcoal toothpaste has become the trendy way in recent years to whiten teeth, but according to the expert, the problem is many charcoal toothpastes don't contain fluoride.\n\nDr Verdian said fluoride is essential for healthy teeth and along with helping to repair any tooth damage before it becomes serious.\n\n'Baking soda is popular, but it's also abrasive,' Dr Verdian said adding 'so if you use it daily, you are actively wearing away your enamel.'\n\nCharcoal toothpaste may not contain fluoride, a mineral which is essential for healthy teeth (stock image)\n\nWhat is fluoride? Tooth decay occurs when acid attacks the surface of the tooth. Fluoride helps repair any damage before it becomes serious. A constant low-level supply of fluoride is best for this.

Drink water which contains fluoride\n\nDr Verdian said fluoride is essential for teeth at any age and drinking tap water is an easily available, affordable way to keep teeth healthy.\n\n'Health professionals report extensive tooth decay in those parts of Queensland that have opted not to add fluoride to their water,' he said.\n\n'Queensland kids aged between 5 and 15 have a 55 per cent rate of tooth decay, while in New South Wales where most people drink fluoridated water, and only around 20 per of children in this age group have decay.'\n\n5. Get your teeth professionally whitened\n\nThese days there are a plethora of options when it comes to teeth whitening, including many DIY versions.\n\n'Most at-home options are simply not strong enough to produce the wow-factor results people want,' Dr Verdian said.\n\n'An in-chair whitening treatment is faster, safer and far more effective.'\n\n6. Ditch coffee and red wine\n\nDr Verdian explained the problem with coffee and red wine were they had a 'double whammy' effect on the teeth.\n\n'The tannins stain teeth and their acidity damages the enamel,' he said.\n\n'If you do have a cuppa or a glass of wine, have it together with a low-pH food like wholegrains or cheese as that can act as a bit of a barrier to the acid.'\n\nTo minimise any issues that can arise, the expert advised always rinsing your mouth with water after.\n\nCoffee and red wine can stain the teeth and the acidity can cause tooth decay (stock image)\n\n7. Always chew sugar-free gum\n\nDentists, including Dr Verdian, believe chewing sugar-free gum creates saliva, which itself fights decay.\n\n'Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after eating can prompt your mouth to produce more saliva,' he said.\n\n'This can helps neutralise acid attacks that cause dental decay.'\n\n8. Understand how to properly brush your teeth\n\nWhen it comes to brushing teeth, many operate under the assumption a quick going over is all that's needed.\n\nDr Verdian said it's not only important to brush properly but also ensure you're not brushing too hard as doing so can damage the enamel.\n\nHe explained the correct way to brush teeth is to angle a soft bristle toothbrush at 45 degrees and use small circular motions.\n\n'Electric toothbrushes mimic that so it takes out the guesswork,' he said.\n\nHow often should you change your toothbrush? * Replace toothbrushes every three to four months. * Consider getting a new toothbrush sooner if you have been sick, especially if the toothbrush is stored close to other toothbrushes. * When in doubt, look at the bristles. If they are frayed, they won't clean teeth as thoroughly. * Because children often brush more rigorously than adults, they may need their toothbrushes replaced more often. Source: Colgate\n\n9. Don't go on a 'dental holiday'\n\nRegardless of the fact it can cheaper to travel overseas for dental work like veneers and implants, there are risks and this type of work can go wrong.\n\n'Research shows that the 10-year success rate of porcelain veneers done by someone experienced versus moderately experienced is 91 per cent to 47 per cent respectively,' Dr Verdian said.\n\nHe advised booking this type of dentistry with a trusted local dentist as you're more likely to see a professional who can create a straighter, brighter smile with the latest technology in a safe, clean environment.\n\n10. Be prepared to go under the microscope\n\nDr Verdian is the only dentist in Australia who utilises Microscope-Enhanced Dentistry for all of his procedures.\n\nMicroscopic-enhanced dentistry magnifies the tooth up to 20 times - something that allows for a level of precision dentistry like no other.\n\n'That kind of detail makes the world of difference - it means we can do veneers with little or no tooth preparation, so the tooth structure is not compromised,' he said.\n\n'Microscopic dentistry is undoubtedly the future and it is a path I aim to pave for the next generation of dental surgeons.'", "description": "A Sydney cosmetic dentist has revealed how to keep your smile perfectly white.
