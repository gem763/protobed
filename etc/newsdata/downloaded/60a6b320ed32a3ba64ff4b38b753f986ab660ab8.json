It\u2019s another to let him,\u201d she said in a series of postings. \u201cThe integrity of our democracy isn\u2019t threatened when a president breaks the law. It\u2018s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP\u2019s silence & refusal to act shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Ours is.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional Democratic leaders have so far resisted calls to impeach the president, fearing it would be harmful to Democratic candidates seeking re-election in Republican-leaning areas in 2020. There also is little prospect that any effort would be successful in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nPelosi has said Congress should pass laws so a sitting president can be indicted. Several House committees are also pursuing investigations of the Trump administration.\n\nYet, calls for a stronger Democratic response are coming not just from the freshman congresswoman from New York and her allies, but much of the Democratic presidential field. Elizabeth Warren, who leads in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN Iowa poll, pressed Congress to \u201cstep up\u201d and begin impeachment proceedings against Trump while campaigning in the state.\n\n\u201cWhat the president has now demonstrated is that he thinks it\u2019s pretty clear, he doesn\u2019t have to follow the law and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d Warren said Friday in Cedar Rapids.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, widely known as AOC, also retweeted a post from presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u201cWhat is Congress waiting for?\u201d O\u2019Rourke asked while elevating a tweet on the Ukraine issue and Pelosi\u2019s lack of impeachment response. \u201cThis is crazy. Unless we take action now, we will see the end of American democracy.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Karen Leigh in Hong Kong at kleigh4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shamim Adam at sadam2@bloomberg.net, Derek Wallbank\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Democrats were being weak on President Donald Trump, in the wake of reports that he asked Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate the son of Democratic front-runner Joe Biden.\u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking", "authors": ["Karen Leigh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
