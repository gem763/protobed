That fact somehow went amiss last week, when the show\u2019s 10th series delivered an underwhelming, slightly clunky premiere. Things are looking up in this second episode, which revives the tried and true Bake Off hallmarks that have turned a baking competition into a global phenomenon over the past decade.\n\nIt\u2019s biscuit week in the tent and we waste no time diving into this episode\u2019s signature challenge: decorated chocolate biscuit bars. As any Bake Off fan will know by now, biscuits mean judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith will be paying close attention to texture, be it snappy, crumbly or shortbready. The bakers, naturally, display admirable creativity when it comes to riffing off this week\u2019s theme \u2013 Helena\u2019s making matcha-flavoured \u201cwitch fingers\u201d, while Henry\u2019s going for an intricate combination of hazelnut shortbread with a coffee and cardamom mousse and hazelnut caramel. Upon getting teased by Hollywood and co-host Noel Fielding about wearing a tie, 20-year-old Henry proudly declares that his sartorial goal is to look \u201clike a prepubescent American schoolboy\u201d. At this point, who knows how his chocolate biscuit bars will turn out, but his witty repartee is certainly baked to perfection.\n\nTime goes by fast during the signature challenge, meaning the bakers, of course, scramble to finish. Participants unite to help a struggling Priya and Jamie salvage their bakes. The contestants have had a week to get to know one another, and it shows \u2013 throughout the episode, they exchange encouragements and words of support, and later on, when Michael gets upset over his showstopper, Priya rushes to comfort him. This is the kind of good-natured solidarity fans of Bake Off have come to crave, and it\u2019s good to see it in action once again.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But the title Annie Hall was eventually settled on, inspired by actress Diane Keaton's real name, Diane Hall, and her nickname, Annie. United Artists 2/27 Dynasty (1981-89) Original title: Oil Oil The hit series, which revolves around the family of an oil magnate, was originally supposed to be titled\u2026 wait for it\u2026 Oil. But it was then changed to Dynasty to compete with rival soap Dallas. CBS Television Distribution 3/27 Back to the Future (1985) Original title: Spaceman from Pluto Spaceman from Pluto Steven Spielberg genuinely thought the title Spaceman from Pluto was a joke suggestion, so it didn\u2019t last long, and was soon replaced by the now iconic name Back to the Future. He contacted the Universal Studios head Sid Sheinberg who had suggested the Pluto title, with a message thanking him for sending his wonderful \"joke\" name, saying the office \"got a kick out of it\". Ouch. Universal Pictures 4/27 The Breakfast Club (1985) Original title: The Lunch Bunch The Lunch Bunch The original script for this classic high-school movie went by the very naff name The Lunch Bunch, but thanks to the son of one of director John Hughes's friends, who had a school detention class called The Breakfast Club, the title was changed. Universal Pictures 5/27 Fatal Attraction (1987) Original title: Affairs of the Heart Affairs of the Heart The much friendlier sounding Affairs of the Heart wasn\u2019t a great match for the psychological thriller that brought us the bunny boiler, and after it received a poor reception from audiences, the film\u2019s title was changed to Fatal Attraction. Paramount Pictures 6/27 Licence to Kill (1989) Original title: Licence Revoked Licence Revoked This Bond film was, at one time, called Licence Revoked, but test audiences associated the title too much with driving, so thankfully it was changed to something far punchier. United Artists 7/27 Saved by the Bell (1989-93) Original title: Good Morning, Miss Bliss Good Morning, Miss Bliss NBC\u2019s Good Morning Miss Bliss centred on Hayley Mills as the eponymous teacher but, after the comedy briefly moved to the Disney Channel and then back to NBC, it was re-tooled to focus on the teenage students instead, therefore taking on a new name: Saved By The Bell. CBS Studios International 8/27 Goodfellas (1990) Original title: Wiseguy Wiseguy The Scorsese classic is an adaptation of a mobster novel called Wiseguy, which was originally also the title of the film, but the name had to be changed because it had already been taken for an 80s TV series. Warner Bros 9/27 Pretty Woman (1990) Original title: 3000 3000 Originally a dark drama about class and sex work, Pretty Woman\u2019s first title was 3,000 \u2013 the amount of money that Richard Gere's character Edward spends on a week of Vivian's (Julia Roberts) time. Disney changed the name as it came across as \u201ctoo science-fictiony\u201d, as well as the tone of the movie which was turned into a rom-com fairytale. Buena Vista Pictures 10/27 Friends (1994-2004) Original title: Six of One Six of One The beloved sitcom went through many different name changes, with all the following titles considered: Friends Like Us, Six of One, Across the Hall, Once Upon a Time in the West Village, and Insomnia Cafe. It\u2019s now hard to imagine the show becoming such a monumental hit with any of those names. Warner Bros Television Distribution 11/27 Pulp Fiction (1994) Original title: Black Mask Black Mask Pulp Fiction was initially inspired by the detective crime stories in the seminal magazine Black Mask, hence its first name. The publication was a pulp magazine, which goes some way to explaining the new title. Miramax Films 12/27 Titanic (1997) Original title: The Ship of Dreams The Ship of Dreams In a line from the classic 1997 film, the older version of Rose says: \"Titanic was called the ship of dreams, and it was, it really was.\" It was also the original title of the film, before the simpler name of Titanic was chosen. 20th Century Fox 13/27 That '70s Show (1998-2006) Original title: Teenage Wasteland Teenage Wasteland Early ideas for the 70s sitcom\u2019s name included Teenage Wasteland and The Kids Are Alright, but because the creators couldn\u2019t get song title rights from The Who, they were forced to change the name of the show. Carsey-Werner Distribution 14/27 American Pie (1999) Original title: Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate It was a bold move from screenwriter Adam Herz when he submitted his spec script to studios under the title Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But The Executive Will Hate. But the risk paid off, with the film, eventually named American Pie, grossing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worldwide. Universal Pictures 15/27 Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) Original title: Dairy Queens Dairy Queens The black comedy was originally supposed to be called Dairy Queens. However, the company that owns fast food chain Dairy Queen apparently didn't love the idea of being associated with the movie, so they filed a lawsuit and, lo and behold, Drop Dead Gorgeous was born. New Line Cinema 16/27 8 Simple Rules (2002-03) Original title: 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter This family sitcom originally had a longer name, but when star John Ritter \u2013 who played the concerned father in the show \u2013 suddenly died after filming the third episode of the second series, the show changed its format and name to 8 Simple Rules and Ritter\u2019s death was written into the plot. Buena Vista International Television 17/27 Cars (2006) Original title: Route 66 Route 66 The animated hit was initially called Route 66 after the iconic road in America, but the title was changed to Cars to avoid confusion with a 60s TV show of the same name. Buena Vista Pictures 18/27 Hannah Montana (2006-11) Original title: Alexis Texas Alexis Texas Miley Cyrus\u2019s Disney comedy was originally called Alexis Texas but, because a porn actor shares the same name, it had to be changed in case children looked up the show\u2019s title and accidentally found pornography. Disney-ABC Domestic Television 19/27 The Big Bang Theory (2007-19) Original title: Lenny, Penny and Kenny Lenny, Penny and Kenny The Big Bang Theory\u2019s original rhyming title was forced to change after the character Kenny\u2019s name switched to Sheldon, who was then brought to life by Jim Parsons. Warner Bros Television Distribution 20/27 Samantha Who? (2007-09) Original title: Sam I Am Sam I Am Clearance issues with the estate of Dr Seuss led ABC to change the name of its Christina Applegate-led show, as the original title, Sam I Am, drew on the first lines of Dr Seuss\u2019s classic Green Eggs and Ham. Disney \u2013 ABC Domestic Television 21/27 The Good Wife (2009-16) Original title: Leave the Bastard Leave the Bastard The Good Wife\u2019s creators got a call from CBS pushing them to change the title just as it went into production. The network did actually consider Leave the Bastard, but ultimately decided to play it safe with The Good Wife. CBS Television Distribution 22/27 Shutter Island (2010) Original title: Ashecliffe Ashecliffe Ashecliffe, the name of the hospital in Martin Scorcese\u2019s thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was originally going to be the film\u2019s title before it was changed to Shutter Island. Paramount Pictures 23/27 New Girl (2011-18) Original title: Chicks and Dicks Chicks and Dicks New Girl was initially pitched as \"a young ensemble comedy about the sexual politics of men and women\u201d, hence its original, provocative title: Chicks and Dicks. Not only did this name attract the wrong kind of attention, but New Girl better reflected the content of the sitcom, which ended up revolving around Zooey Deschanel\u2019s Jess. 20th Television 24/27 Edge of Tomorrow (2014) Original title: All You Need Is Kill All You Need Is Kill The Tom Cruise action movie was originally known as All You Need Is Kill, the title of the book on which the movie is based, but filmmakers changed the title because they felt the word \"kill\" was too problematic. \"I think the word 'kill' in a title is very tricky in today's world\u2026\" producer Edwin Stoff said. \u201cWe see it enough in real newspaper headlines, and I don't think we need to see it when we're looking at a movie.\" After a lucklustre box office opening, the film's name was changed once again, in marketing and for home release, to Live, Die, Repeat. Warner Bros Pictures 25/27 Lovesick (2014-18) Original title: Scrotal Recall Scrotal Recall The relationship comedy drama starring Johnny Flynn was renamed after one series because, perhaps unsurprisingly, it was suffering from a lack of word of mouth, with people reluctant to say the word \u201cscrotal\u201d. Clerkenwell Films 26/27 Stranger Things (2016-) Original title: Montauk Montauk The original title of the Netflix hit was Montauk, as the plan had been for it to be set in a village of the same name in New York. However, when creators the Duffer brothers later relocated the show\u2019s action to the fictional town of Hawkins in Indiana, the name changed to Stranger Things. Intriguingly, Montauk also happens to be the title of a short film which the Duffer brothers were accused of plagiarising. Netflix 27/27 Arrival (2017) Original title: Story of Your Life Story of Your Life The sci-fi film starring Amy Adams originally went by the title of the novella it was based on, Story of Your Life, but because producer Shawn Levy thought it \"sounds a bit like a One Direction song\u201d and \"multiword titles can be really problematic\u201d, the movie changed its name to Arrival.

Paramount Pictures\n\nMichelle\u2019s Bakewell-themed signature wins over Hollywood and Leith, suggesting that last week\u2019s Star Baker could now be this year\u2019s clear frontrunner. But skilled challengers emerge in Rosie and Alice, whose respective virgin mojito biscuit bars and honeycomb peanut mallow bars are runaway successes. Not doing so great are Helena (whose witches fingers fail to impress Hollywood), Jamie (whose bake isn\u2019t set, but who demonstrates an admirable sense of humour when confronted by Leith\u2019s judging), and Amelia (whose nougat biscuit bars are a bit \u201crough and ready\u201d and not cooked properly, says Hollywood).\n\nMoving on to the technical challenge, which this year consists of fig rolls, a childhood favourite of Hollywood\u2019s. This is announced by Fielding, who forgets he\u2019s supposed to specify the bakers\u2019 rolls must be identical in shape and size \u2013 meaning it\u2019s up to co-host Sandi Toksvig to swoop in to fill in the blank, eliciting giggles from the bakers. \u201cIt\u2019s a given at this point,\u201d Fielding remarks, almost breaking the fourth wall. This is a lighthearted, fleeting moment, but it\u2019s also a sign that the Fielding-Toksvig pairing (which seemed risky when it was announced after Bake Off\u2019s move from the BBC to Channel 4) is beginning to work.\n\nHelena, who accidentally makes 11 fig rolls instead of the mandatory 12, comes bottom of the technical, while Jamie\u2019s egg-washed rolls land him in 11th position. Alice comes first, confirming her status as the rising star of this episode \u2013 and with that, we\u2019re on to the showstopper challenge, a biscuit sculpture.\n\nFor their 3D pieces, the bakers must demonstrate their construction skills, without compromising on appearances and flavours. Rosie, a veterinary surgeon, sets out to craft a chicken out of an impressive 212 biscuits, while Henry aims to build an organ (the church kind) out of gingerbread and brandy snaps. Jamie goes for a biscuit guitar made out of chocolate gingerbread and lemon shortbread, David for a delicate wedding spray, Amelia for a \u201cswimming with dolphins\u201d seascape, and Helena for a spider and her web. Jamie\u2019s biscuits collapse as he takes them out of the oven, pretty much all the bakers mutter to themselves as they rush to finish on time, all of which makes for decently suspenseful television. Ultimately, Rosie\u2019s chicken and David\u2019s wedding spray are hits with the judges, while Henry\u2019s organ and Jamie\u2019s guitar are both deemed underwhelming (this is Bake Off, mind you, so even crafting a church organ out of eggs and flour doesn\u2019t necessarily qualify as a feat). Helena redeems herself with her flavour, which, as Hollywood points out, demonstrates her \u201cmassive artistic flair\u201d, but Amelia\u2019s nautical scene is just \u201cOK\u201d.\n\nAll in all, this is a good episode of Bake Off, which revives many of the show\u2019s beloved features while allowing the personalities of this year\u2019s bakers to shine through. There\u2019s sweetness, creativity and a trademark sense of good-natured competition. Let\u2019s hope this series keeps moving in this direction \u2013 with perhaps an extra hint of tension as the stakes get higher.", "description": "Can you believe it\u2019s been 10 years since The Great British Bake Off entered our lives, causing us to care more about genoise sponge and caramel work than we ever thought possible?
