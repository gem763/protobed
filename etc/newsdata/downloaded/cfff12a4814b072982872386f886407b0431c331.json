This can help you come up with new ideas.\n\nVerity Aylward\n\nIn Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler said: 'The great masses of the people ... will more easily fall victims to a big lie than to a small one.'\n\nTo become an effective independent learner, you need to ask questions about new information you come across. You should consider whether the information is true or not.\n\nCritical thinking skills are valuable not just for learning, but also in understanding yourself and making big decisions. Sometimes they may help you to think creatively and come up with new ideas.\n\nCritical thinking skills\n\nReasoning\n\nWe are thinking critically when we: think carefully rather than simply react to our emotions.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages in Europe, many people believed the earth was flat. They were frightened to disagree with the Church. Scientists like Copernicus and Galileo had to look beyond the most powerful of human emotions: fear.\n\nBy doing so they proved the earth was round and rotated on an axis and orbited around the sun. Thinking 'outside the box' allowed them to come up with new understandings about the universe. Critical thinkers are concerned more with finding the best explanation rather than proving they are always right. They ask questions and weigh up the evidence in order to reach their judgments.\n\nSelf-awareness and honesty\n\nWe are thinking critically when we: Consider people's motives and acknowledge our own assumptions or point of view.\n\nSo why did powerful people in the church during the Middle Ages want people to believe what the priests told them about the universe? Some were motivated by faith, others were motivated by power; they wanted to hold onto it at all costs.\n\nWhen you hear or read new information, think about your own views and beliefs. Your beliefs are not necessarily wrong, but to think critically, you need to be aware of your own prejudices to understand the bigger picture.\n\nOpen-mindedness\n\nWe are thinking critically when we: Consider a variety of possible viewpoints or perspectives.\n\nLike scientists, political leaders need to be open-minded. When presented with new information, politicians must acknowledge alternative views if they are going to resolve conflicts. At times though, ego can get in the way: We want to be right at all times; we want to win. Can you think of any examples where this might be the case in the modern world?\n\nDiscipline\n\nWe are thinking critically when we: Acknowledge other interpretations and resist manipulation of information.\n\nIn 2002, Gavin Menzies, an amateur historian, wrote a book - 1421: The Year China Discovered America. He claimed that Zheng He's fleet discovered America about 70 years before Columbus. These claims have been widely rejected by historians. Some say he manipulated evidence to prove a theory he wanted people to believe.\n\nThe fact that he sees history differently is not so much the problem. It's the process that he used to reach his conclusions that his critics object to: too many assumptions and not enough proven fact.\n\nJudgment\n\nWe are thinking critically when we: Decide which alternative assumptions, perspectives and evidence have merit.\n\nDuring a court case, the jury needs to make a judgment by listening to the evidence and considering its strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes the evidence is so overwhelming that it's easy to come to a decision.\n\nAt other times, there are a lot of 'grey areas' - it's harder to be sure, so judgments may not always be correct. The number of innocent people who were found guilty and were either imprisoned or killed for their 'crimes' has never been firmly established, but there are plenty of them.\n\nTrue or False\n\nWhich of these qualities best describe a critical thinker?\n\n1 Always has to win an argument\n\n2 Looks for evidence to prove they are always right\n\n3 Recognises different interpretations\n\n4 Believes in rumours\n\n5 Understands how language can be used to manipulate information\n\nAnswers\n\n1.
