According to the indictment, Stone\u2014who is charged with obstruction of justice, making false statements, and witness tampering\u2014not only lied to Congress, but attempted to persuade another witness to do so as well. Stone \u201cspoke and texted repeatedly\u201d with the unnamed witness, who has been identified in press reports as the conservative radio personality Randy Credico, to try to get him to \u201cdo a \u2018Frank Pentangeli\u2019 before the House intelligence committee in order to avoid contradicting STONE\u2019s testimony.\u201d (Pentangeli is a character from the mafia film The Godfather: Part II who lies to a congressional committee.)\n\nThe indictment also states that Stone regularly emailed with Trump-campaign officials about the timing of releases from the organization WikiLeaks\u2014document dumps that were meant to damage Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton. The documents were released by WikiLeaks after being stolen by an officer of Russia\u2019s military intelligence directorate, the GRU. Believing that the messaging service WhatsApp was shielded from government surveillance, Stone texted Matt Boyle, a reporter for the pro-Trump website Breitbart News, \u201cSpoke to my friend in London last night. The payload is still coming,\u201d an apparent reference to WikiLeaks.\n\nRead: It was all in plain sight\n\nBut Stone is hardly the only example of a Trump adviser breaking the Stringer Bell rule.\n\nIn July, Trump\u2019s former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, who has been charged with fraud and tax evasion, was jailed after prosecutors claimed that he sought to use \u201cphone calls, text messages and encrypted apps\u201d to shape the accounts of other potential witnesses in the investigation. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former campaign surrogate and national-security adviser, who was indicted for lying about his interactions with Russian officials regarding sanctions, was undone in part by emails that showed he \u201cwas in close touch with other senior members of the Trump transition team both before and after he spoke with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, about American sanctions against Russia.\u201d\n\nEmails also showed that George Papadopoulos, the Trump foreign-policy adviser whose remarks to a foreign diplomat about obtaining Clinton\u2019s emails set the Russia investigation into motion, had kept the campaign apprised of his outreach efforts to Moscow. Papadopoulos ultimately served time for lying to federal investigators. Prosecutors also cited extensive email communication in charges that Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, engaged in illegal lobbying on behalf of the Ukrainian government. Prosecutors said Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen sent invoices for the hush money he used to facilitate the silence of women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump, in violation of federal campaign-finance laws.", "description": "Roger Stone is the latest of the president\u2019s associates to ignore the most important rule in a conspiracy: Don\u2019t take notes.", "authors": ["Adam Serwer", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/01/RTS2C6TF/facebook.jpg?1548435442", "published_at": "2019-01-25"}
