Power hitters in the lineups. Hard-throwing relievers out of the bullpen.\n\nThe National League Division Series between the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers is a perfect fit for Hollywood. There are stars all over the field.\n\nHaving won a franchise-record 106 games in the regular season, the Dodgers are aiming for a third consecutive World Series appearance after losing to Houston and Boston the last two years.\n\n\u201cOur only goal is to win a championship,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cWe are equipped to accomplish that goal.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals have a streak of their own they want to end: four losses in the Division Series since 2012.\n\nThe Dodgers haven\u2019t played a meaningful game in a couple of months. They cruised to their seventh straight NL West title by 21 games over Arizona.\n\nThe Nationals eked their way into this round with a dramatic wild-card victory over Milwaukee, helped by a Brewers error in the eighth inning. They slept in their own beds Wednesday night, flew all day Thursday and arrived at Dodger Stadium early in the evening for a workout ahead of the best-of-five series.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all excited about what happened yesterday,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said, \u201cbut they understand what\u2019s ahead of them.\u201d\n\nHere are some things to watch for going into Game 1 on Thursday:\n\nBUEHLER?\n\nFor the second straight year, Clayton Kershaw won\u2019t be opening the postseason for the Dodgers. A year ago, they went with Hyun-Jin Ryu against the Atlanta Braves, ending Kershaw\u2019s streak of six consecutive playoff appearances starting Game 1.\n\nThis year, right-hander Walker Buehler gets the nod.\n\n\u201cAround here I don\u2019t know if one, two or three really matters,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cThe order\u2019s a little bit less significant than people want to make it out to be.\u201d\n\nBuehler worked on his mechanics in his final tuneup last Friday at San Francisco, where he gave up two runs and walked four in five innings. Last season, he debuted a new slider in a start against St. Louis.\n\n\u201cAfter that one went well, all the kind of doubt went away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think what I\u2019m doing now and the tinkering is a little bit overblown. I\u2019m just working on things like I have my whole career.\u201d\n\nNATS BIG THREE\n\nThe Nationals are going with Patrick Corbin in Game 1 for his postseason debut, their so-called third ace among a trio that includes Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Corbin, Strasburg, we haven\u2019t had a whole lot of success against those two guys,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cThe success or limited success we have had against Scherzer, it\u2019s very limited still.\u201d\n\nCorbin has a 3.36 ERA in 21 career games against the Dodgers, having faced them regularly when he was in the NL West with Arizona.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to fool them. They know what I have,\u201d he said. \u201cJust going to go out there, treat it like any other start and just be myself.\u201d\n\nMR. CONSISTENT\n\nWashington third baseman Anthony Rendon is having a huge year. He batted .319 with 34 home runs and 126 RBIs, all career highs that have put him in the MVP conversation.\n\nThe 29-year-old All-Star attributes his numbers to mostly luck, joking that he gets a lot of cheap hits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting broken-bat hits, I\u2019m getting flares, I\u2019m trying to pull the ball to left field, and I\u2019ll hit it off the end and it will trickle down the right field line, stuff like that,\u201d Rendon said. \u201cWe talk about it in the clubhouse or in the dugout, it\u2019s like, of course, he has another one that falls.\u201d\n\nMartinez has called Rendon \u201cMr. Consistent\u201d since before he became manager last year.\n\n\u201cWhat makes him really good is that he\u2019s not afraid to hit with two strikes,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe\u2019ll battle you up there and hit the ball the other way. But when he gets to two strikes, there\u2019s no panic.\u201d\n\nBELLINGER\u2019s MVP BID\n\nCody Bellinger allowed himself to soak in the chants of \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d during the Dodgers\u2019 regular-season finale in San Francisco. The slugger didn\u2019t have as strong a second half as before the All-Star break, but still ended up hitting .305 with 47 home runs and 115 RBIs.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s out of my hands, so I\u2019m not going to worry about that right now and put all my focus in on these next games,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Dodgers aren\u2019t letting it go, though.\n\nThey\u2019re giving away a Bellinger bobblehead at Thursday\u2019s game, the team\u2019s first ever in the postseason. The first 40,000 fans will receive one with Bellinger doing his home run trot in either his home white uniform or road gray jersey.\n\nKEEPING IT CLOSE\n\nThe Nationals haven\u2019t announced their starters for Games 2 and 3, which Roberts pointed out while declining to reveal which order Kershaw and Ryu will go in. However, Roberts already said 39-year-old left-hander Rich Hill will start Game 4, if necessary.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cYou think about your girlfriend that broke up with you like 20 years ago? Probably not, so no.\u201d _ Rendon on whether he still thinks about losing to the Dodgers in the 2016 NLDS.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The National League Division Series between the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers is a perfect fit for Hollywood.
