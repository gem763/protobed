To improve sleep quality, one needs to know the exact condition of his sleep.\n\nPeople's gaits convey unique personal traits including mental and physical health. It has been confirmed in previous studies that the way people walk, such as pace, can indicate the length and quality of their sleep.\n\nCompared with existing sleep monitoring methods like smart bracelets, polysomnography and questionnaires, gait analysis is accurate, noninvasive, low-cost, and easy to use.\n\nAided by Kinect, a line of motion sensing input devices, the research team with the Institute of Psychology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences collected sleep quality scores and gait data from 56 participants and analyzed the connection between the two, coming to an conclusion that gait can reveal sleep quality quite well.", "description": "BEIJING - Chinese researchers said people's manner of walking, or gait, can help monitor their sleep quality with the aid of machine learning models, according to a study recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/14/5da3ea74a310cf3e97a11f87.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
