Just chop all the ingredients before you start cooking, open the tin of tomatoes and take the top off the cider (don\u2019t drink any!), then it\u2019s just a matter of adding everything to the saucepan in order.\n\nAlternatively, everything could be browned in a frying pan, transferred to a casserole dish or slow cooker and left to cook for longer if you are too busy to stand over the hob.\n\nWhichever way you cook it, be sure to make extra, as the flavour is even better the following day.\n\nThis stew freezes really well and, if you pour into freezer bags and freeze flat, it will defrost very quickly.
