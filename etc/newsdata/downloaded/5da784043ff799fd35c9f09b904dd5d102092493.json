But the way it\u2019s doing it isn\u2019t always distinctly coercive or overtly invasive. While there\u2019s been an important focus on technologies such as 5G, surveillance and cyber-enabled espionage, that narrow view misses the bigger picture. The Chinese Communist Party has a much more ambitious vision for harnessing a broad suite of current and emerging technologies in support of its own interests, including some that might seem relatively benign, like language-translation technologies.\n\nBy leveraging state-owned enterprises, Chinese technology companies and partnerships with foreign entities\u2014including Western universities\u2014the CCP is building a massive data-collection enterprise that gives it control over large data flows.\n\nFor the Chinese party-state, data-gathering is a means of generating information to enhance state security\u2014and, crucially, the political security of the CCP\u2014across multiple domains. The party-state intends to shape, manage and control its global operating environment so that public sentiment is favourable to its own interests. The CCP\u2019s interests are prioritised over the Chinese state\u2019s interests and the Chinese people\u2019s interests. The effort requires continuous expansion of the party\u2019s power overseas because, according to its own articulation of its threat perceptions, external risks to its power are just as likely\u2014if not more likely\u2014to emerge from outside the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s borders as from within.\n\nAs this approach continues to take shape, many Western governments will find themselves both struggling to understand the problem and struggling to respond.\n\nA new report from ASPI\u2019s International Cyber Policy Centre uses the company Global Tone Communications Technology (GTCOM) as a case study to explain how this new phenomenon can work. GTCOM is a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned enterprise that the Central Propaganda Department directly supervises. It provides both hardware and software translation tools. GTCOM describes itself as a \u2018cross-language big data\u2019 business: it collects bulk data globally in more than 65 languages and processes it for output into other products and services for government and corporate clients. The products can be applied to tools that have global implications, such as parts of China\u2019s social credit system.\n\nGTCOM claims to collect \u2018billions\u2019 of pieces of globally sourced unstructured data. Through just one of its many platforms, focused on traditional and social media, GTCOM claims to gather 10 terabytes of data a day (equivalent to 5 trillion words of plain text) as part of its \u2018cross-language big data\u2019 business, and 2\u20133 petabytes a year (equivalent to 20 billion photos on Facebook). Anything translated by the company\u2019s translation services is part of the bulk data it collects.\n\nThe company uses bulk data collection and artificial intelligence processing of data for information platforms and tools provided to the party-state. Such tools include propaganda, intelligence, social credit system\u2013linked creditworthiness determination products, and government services.\n\nAs GTCOM is a company openly contributing to state security and intelligence data collection, the case study sheds light on many other issues that should be of critical importance to global decision-makers. It demonstrates, for instance, the global consequences of the PRC\u2019s military\u2013civil fusion priority, which \u2018seeks to break down the barriers between China\u2019s civilian and military sectors\u2019.\n\nNational and local governments across the globe\u2014under liberal and illiberal regimes alike\u2014are choosing to buy technologies from PRC companies such as GTCOM\u2019s strategic partners Alibaba Cloud and Huawei. For instance, ASPI\u2019s Mapping China\u2019s technology giants report conducted research into 75 smart city projects around the world, most of which involved Huawei. Many of those projects include more coercive and overtly invasive technologies, such as surveillance cameras and facial and numberplate recognition technologies, but they can also include services like smart transportation and smart parking meters.\n\nCompanies such as GTCOM and its strategic partners can simultaneously act in their best interests to provide services and generate profits and to support the party-state\u2019s larger objectives. After all, it\u2019s the party-state that allows them to operate. No single PRC-based actor is shielded from the reality of the CCP\u2019s suite of state security legislation, which delivers the consistent message that every individual and entity is responsible for state security.\n\nWhile ideal solutions to this emerging set of problems don\u2019t exist yet, partly because research on these issues hasn\u2019t been in-depth or forward-looking, there are a range of areas that governments should be investing in and working with industry and civil society on. The report recommends strengthening data privacy laws and foreign influence transparency schemes. It also recommends greater investment in data literacy and data transparency programs, and calls for a rethink of how governments deal with foreign propaganda in the digital age.", "description": "The Chinese party-state\u0092s technology-enhanced authoritarianism is expanding globally.
