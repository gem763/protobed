The parody stars Cecily Strong as Judge Connie Schaumberg, a no-nonsense judge from the Upper West Side who resides over a court comprised entirely of \u2014 wait for it \u2014 dogs. If that isn\u2019t enough to pique your interest, just wait until host David Harbour and Kate McKinnon get into it as two ornery dog-owners who had an unfortunate interaction involving Harbour\u2019s dog and McKinnon\u2019s bosom at the dog park on 110th and Amsterdam.\n\nThe real star of the sketch doesn\u2019t appear until halfway through, when Strong unsuccessfully attempts to hold a pug that is simply not having it. As the pug squirms about, Judge Connie Schaumberg admits that she doesn\u2019t bring her dog to the park because she doesn\u2019t allow her dog to walk: \u201cI don\u2019t like how she does it. Now, she rides around in a little football helmet. Mmkay? Think about that.\u201d Not only does that pug clearly need to be walked, but she also needs to be featured in every episode of SNL going forward. She\u2019s ready for primetime.", "description": "\u2019Saturday Night Live\u2019 host David Harbour appeared with Kate McKinnon and Cecily Strong in a court-show parody sketch featuring a very frantic pug.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/13-Dog-Court.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
