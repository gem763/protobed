A variety of cream- and khaki-coloured sofas decorate the living room, from which the neighbouring study is in full view due to a set of sliding glass doors.\n\nWhile technically a four-bedroom unit, it\u2019s currently configured with three bedrooms and a high-end home gym occupying the fourth. There\u2019s also a wine cellar and tasting bar, an informal dining room and a secondary family room.\n\nMASS Beverly, which has done homes for Beyonce and Calvin Klein, chose earthy tones for most of the home with the exception of blue accents\u2014such as a velvet armchair in one of the bedrooms\u2014a colour that ties into the San Francisco Bay below.\n\nSan Fran's highest home The study.

Matt called it \u201cthe most seismically sound residential buildings in the world,\u201d with 42 of the caissons drilled 80m into the bedrock.\n\nAt the moment, the grand penthouse also boasts some $US7 million worth of contemporary artwork, which is for sale through separate negotiation, says Matt.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Mansion Global.", "description": "The tallest residence west of Chicago has hit the market in the heart of San Francisco, asking $46 million ($AU67.1m).", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/12124724/181_Fremont-Penthouse-0905.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
