Photo: Courtesy of Starface\n\nHistorically, we\u2019ve been very violent toward pimples. We pick at the them, pop them, scrub them, burn them with acids, and when that doesn\u2019t work, slowly suffocate them with concealer and foundation. We even continue to openly watch pimple snuff films; so much so that they now air on national networks. But the resistance has arrived, and it\u2019s planting the seeds of a countermovement.\n\nGen-Z celebs are bestowing tender names upon their zits, brands are inviting breakouts to photoshoots, and Starface, a new line of photogenic hydrocolloid pimple patches, is here to protect your pimples and style them, too. \u201cI saw a million dermatologists, read a thousand studies, and tried a zillion products, and my skin didn\u2019t really change,\u201d says Julie Schott, Starface co-founder and former beauty director of Elle.com. \u201cI still had the low-key acne that I always had, and I was finding that nothing really made a difference, except a change in my attitude.\u201d\n\nSchott\u2019s new line of \u201cHydro-Stars\u201d doesn\u2019t shame your zits. The stars have all the benefits of a hydrocolloid patch (\u201cthey absorb fluid so it flattens the pimple itself, and they protect the pimple from outside bacteria and your urges to pick, squeeze, and further aggravate it\u201d). But they also decorate them with \u201ccute as f*ck stars,\u201d turning your face into a glorious, selfie-ready star map.\n\nEach kit comes with 8 of these 4-sticker sheets.\n\nSchott landed on the star shape because the li\u2019l arms help each patch grip to any curve on your face; an important factor, considering we\u2019re not all blessed with pimples that have convenient Cindy Crawford\u2013mole coordinates. Today\u2019s Starface launch is a good day for pimples worldwide, but the rest of your skin may thank you for learning to style breakouts instead of ambushing them. \u201cI\u2019d much rather have a couple of pimples and some human skin with some glow to it instead of full-on destroying everything,\u201d says Schott.\n\nJustin Bieber, budding beauty entrepreneur and arbiter of style, once boldly declared that \u201cpimples are in,\u201d and though the pimply photo he posted is no longer with us, I\u2019d like him to know he was basically right. Scroll through some of the Starface look book below with any pimples currently hanging out on your face and ask them if they\u2019d like to shop for a new outfit. They\u2019re going to like the way they look. I guarantee it.\n\nClockwise from left: Photo: Courtesy of Starface Photo: Courtesy of Starface Photo: Courtesy of Starface Clockwise from left: Photo: Courtesy of Starface Photo: Courtesy of Starface Photo: Courtesy of Starface\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Former beauty editor Julie Schott\u2019s newest venture, Starface, is a line of photogenic pimple patches that will make you start loving your breakouts.", "authors": ["Erica Smith"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/05/starface/lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
