Here's What the Charts Say", "language": "en", "text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is due to report its third quarter earnings after the close of trading Monday. Let's check the charts and indicators ahead of time, so we can zero in on the chart points that are worth watching later in the day.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of GOOGL, below, we can see that prices are just a few dollars short of a new all-time high and fresh upside breakout. GOOGL is above the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day line, as well.\n\nThe 50-day average moved above the 200-day line in early August for a buy signal, commonly known as a golden cross. This moving average crossover system tends to be late, but can be effective in long-trending markets. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) has been moving sideways the past four months, but it is not all that far from making a new high for the move up. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bullish configuration above the zero-line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of GOOGL, below, we can prices are making what is probably the third serious test of the $1,300 area. Prices are trading above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been \"saw-toothing\" lower from April and is not the most positive looking indicator in the toolbox. The MACD oscillator is well above the zero-line and rising. So, on balance, this is a bullish set-up.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of GOOGL, below, we can see that a trade at $1,307.68 will be a new high for the move up and a key breakout on this kind of chart. This trade would open the way to further gains and the chart's potential upside price target of $1,615.\n\nBottom line strategy: GOOGL looks set to make a bullish upside breakout. Traders who can afford to risk below $1,240 could go long or add to existing longs here. Strength above $1,308 is very bullish.", "description": "As Alphabet trades higher as investors expect a positive earnings report, the indicators show a bullish path for the the tech giant....GOOGL", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Searching For Answers On Where Googl Is Heading", "Here'S What The Charts Say", "As Alphabet Trades Higher As Investors Expect A Positive Earnings Report", "The Indicators Show A Bullish Path For The The Tech Giant.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Jim Cramer"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/e385c81a-9f56-11e9-9fed-1df46c506627.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
