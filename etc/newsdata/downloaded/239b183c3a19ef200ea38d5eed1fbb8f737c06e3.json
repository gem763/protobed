Money just sitting there, catching dust.\n\nThe amounts are jaw-dropping when you consider that up to 3% of people sleeping rough in England are ex-servicemen and women.\n\nAround 3,500 homeless veterans across the UK are not getting the support they are entitled to. A number that that cash could easily wipe out.\n\n(Image: Daily Post Wales)\n\nAccording to figures compiled by Plaid Cymru last year, more than 60,000 armed forces veterans in the UK have either broken the law, found themselves homeless or are suffering from mental health issues.\n\nThe stats suggest 10,000 are in prison, on parole or on probation having turned to crime.\n\nSo for the military charities to have the equivalent of the money pile in the TV series Breaking Bad sitting in a vault somewhere, doing nothing, is a disgrace.\n\nThe Mirror\u2019s Pride of Britain Awards are in their 20th year of celebrating veterans as well as everyday people whose acts of bravery and selflessness were an inspiration to us all.\n\nThere are so many worthy charities working hard to alleviate the suffering of men and women unable to help themselves physically, practically and emotionally.\n\n(Image: TIM ANDERSON)\n\nIt is a scandal that they are not backed by the finances that could change lives. Especially when so many are bracing themselves for yet another cold winter on the streets.\n\nIt is no good Edward Parker, Chief Executive for the Walking With The Wounded charity, calling for more to be done to help those in need to access services. The money is there to get out on the streets and take the help to them.\n\nPeople want to keep giving to back up the work of those on the front line. What they could grow tired of doing is topping up a money mountain while the people who need it most suffer.", "description": "Britain\u2019s 10 biggest military charities have combined assets of over \u00a31.4billion - with reserves of nearly \u00a3280million - just sitting there, catching dust", "authors": ["Darren Lewis", "Image", "Daily Post Wales", "Tim Anderson"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743609.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Poppy-AppealED.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
