I knew going into @thexfactor anything could happen & the level of talent was so high this year!\n\n\"I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity as it has completely pushed me out of my comfort zone, reminding myself I love to be up on that stage. That being said, yes my elimination came as a shock.\n\n(Image: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX)\n\n\"I was confused why Simon would tell me I could win this competition and then ultimately send me home. It was a punch in the gut.\n\n\"People have emotions and mine got the best of me...because I REALLY wanted this.\n\n\"I\u2019m proud of my performance last night and that\u2019s what matters to me. Good luck to all my new friends I\u2019ve made a long the way.
