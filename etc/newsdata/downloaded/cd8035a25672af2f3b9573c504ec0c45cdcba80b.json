The fair has gone from dusty irrelevance during a long sojourn in the suburbs to a glittering fixture on the art world calendar.\n\nLondon galleries are launching new spaces in Paris, and US dealerships, who would once have chosen London as their European base, are going to Paris instead. Is it the Brexit effect? The Macron effect? Or is it simply that with a revitalised art fair rivalling Frieze for international clout, a vibrant gallery scene, a growing number of serious young collectors and world-class museums, Paris is having a moment?\n\nIn February 2018 the Los Angeles gallery Freedman Fitzpatrick opened a second space near the Hotel de Ville because, says its co-director Robbie Fitzpatrick, \u201cover four years exhibiting at FIAC we realised we were making our highest number of sales outside the US in France, both to private collectors and institutions\u201d.\n\nThey are not the only ones. On Wednesday, FIAC\u2019s preview day and private viewing, David Zwirner inaugurates his first continental outpost in the 8,600sq ft space once occupied by the famed French gallerist Yvon Lambert. Meanwhile, White Cube has announced it will open offices and a viewing room on Avenue Matignon early next year, and rumour has it that Pace Gallery and Hauser & Wirth are \u201clooking\u201d. Neither will confirm or deny this, but both sent ambiguous emails when asked. \u201cAs always, we would need the perfect combination of the right strategy, opportunity and passion,\u201d wrote Iwan Wirth. \u201cUltimately, we remain completely committed to being embedded in London\u2019s vibrant cultural scene; that will not change.\u201d\n\nTova Ossad, who founded the consultancy Ossad Art Management this year, does not think Paris will replace London. \u201cI don\u2019t see it. There\u2019s too much to unravel. London\u2019s roots are too deep, and it is so international \u2013 you have Asia, the US and the Middle East. But galleries that identify as European may want to open there. And that\u2019s good for us both \u2013 two thriving markets working together.\u201d\n\nAll the galleries coming from London emphasise its significance as a global art hub and while most concede that Brexit is a factor in their move across the Channel, it is not the only reason.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tracey Emin and Jay Jopling, who epitomise the Young British Art movement, are putting their faith in Paris. Photograph: Richard Young/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nMathieu Paris, senior director of White Cube in London for the past six years, is returning to his native city to run the new space. \u201cThis is absolutely not an emergency solution to the political situation,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact is that for the last seven years Paris has been back on the map.\n\n\u201cIt was always a city for artists and collectors but there was a decline after the second world war. You can really feel its renaissance now and we want to tap into the French tradition of the marchand d\u2019art, showing great masterpieces in an intimate, discreet way from a beautiful Haussmann apartment in a prestigious area.\u201d\n\nThis sounds like the antithesis of the pared-down Young British Artist movement of 1990s London from which White Cube emerged, its owner, Jay Jopling, the preeminent YBA dealer. Not so, says Tracey Emin, who lives in France for some of the year and has a studio there. \u201cJay only has two YBA artists now \u2013 me and Damien [Hirst]. Opening a space in Paris is a way of changing perceptions and expressing the gallery\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\nGerman-born Zwirner has said that identity is central to his decision, telling the Financial Times: \u201cBrexit changes the game. After October my London gallery will be a British gallery, not a European one. I am European, and I would like a European gallery too.\u201d\n\nGlenn Scott-Wright\u2019s assertion that in these times of uncertainty \u201ceverybody needs a European base\u201d seems to be the general consensus. Scott-Wright, co-director of Victoria Miro Gallery, says he sees \u201ca definite shift towards Paris\u201d.\n\n\u201cFrench auction houses have a more serious presence on the contemporary scene than before, and [Fran\u00e7ois] Pinault and [Bernard] Arnault are hugely influential,\u201d he says of the magnates and collectors.\n\nParis\u2019s fashion and luxury-goods houses are intrinsic to the art scene. There is huge excitement over the \u201chome-coming\u201d of Pinault whose two magnificent Venice art spaces look set to be eclipsed by his $170m contemporary art museum set to open in Paris next June. to the Louvre des Antiquaires building opposite the Louvre, in 2024, will transform a dreary tourist parade into a booming contemporary art centre. And Arnault\u2019s Fondation Louis Vuitton has produced a stunning run of exhibitions over the past four years.\n\n\u201cLouis Vuitton\u2019s sponsorship of Yayoi Kusama\u2019s retrospective [Tate Modern in London, the Whitney in New York, Museo Nacional Centro de Art Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid, and the Pompidou in Paris] helped to make her a household name with a broader non-art world audience,\u201d adds Scott-Wright.\n\nAs part of FIAC\u2019s Hors les Murs programme which places outdoor artworks in public spaces, Victoria Miro has collaborated with David Zwirner and Ota Fine Arts to commission a vast Kusama installation for Place Vend\u00f4me. \u201cKusama says no to an awful lot,\u201d says Scott-Wright, \u201cbut she couldn\u2019t say no to this. Paris holds tremendous allure for artists.\u201d\n\nEmin agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s an antidote to everything we don\u2019t like in the world right now: the beauty of the city, the fact that you walk everywhere; it feels artisanal, a place to reclaim your soul.\u201d", "description": "A reinvigorated contemporary art fair, opening this week in the Grand Palais, is one sign of a renaissance for the French capital", "authors": ["Sophie Hastings"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/885785ec2800042aa2b92a4e50aea79666fd9c30/0_226_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=416b98f458de7d9f32130a663aebfe7d", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
