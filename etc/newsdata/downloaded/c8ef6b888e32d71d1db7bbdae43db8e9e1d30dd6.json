Previous industry thinking had been limited to only ground transportation technology. Now we're thinking in three dimensions.\"\n\nThe partnership with AmeriSource Bergen revolves around using drones to deliver pharmaceuticals and supplies to medical campuses served by the drug wholesale company.\n\nMeanwhile, UPS and Kaiser Permanente will work together on ways to transport healthcare supplies between buildings at Kaiser Permanente medical campuses. Similarly, the partnership with the University of Utah will focus on delivering medical supplies instruments, supplies and documents across the medical school campus.\n\nOn top of the new partnerships, UPS also announced that it will form a new UPS Healthcare and Life Sciences Division to study the market and find more industry in roads for Flight Forward.\n\nEarlier this month UPS announced that Flight Forward achieved the highly restricted Part 135 air carrier certification, which allows for approved UPS drones to fly over people, at night and out of the operator's line of sight. The certification, the highest level of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval for a drone delivery operation, is a key step in the company's plan to integrate drone delivery into the broader UPS logistics network.\n\nRELATED STORIES:", "description": "UPS' drone delivery subsidiary, UPS Flight Forward, is also partnering with AmeriSource Bergen, Kaiser Permanente and the University of Utah.", "authors": ["Natalie Gagliordi"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/26/4fe11e05-1508-4a4d-ae34-b6d6f91dd349/thumbnail/770x578/956e1070e0263974b86ae6f478f91e78/ups-matternet-drone.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
