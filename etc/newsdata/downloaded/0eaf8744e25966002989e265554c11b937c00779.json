He never saw the call \u2014 heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is \u2014 they\u2019re almost a spy,\u201d Trump said in a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart, right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nAfter learning of Trump\u2019s remarks, former Vice President Joe Biden, who Trump asked Zelensky to investigate, took the president\u2019s comments as a death threat.\n\n\u201cAnd now we know that President Trump\u2019s response to all of this was to privately issue a thinly veiled threat this morning to execute the national security professionals who followed their oath to uphold the Constitution by bringing this to light,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\n\nPhoto: Alex Brandon/AP More\n\nFor days, the Trump administration and many of its Republican supporters have sought to discredit the whistleblower who submitted the complaint, but acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire said during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower \u201cacted in good faith throughout\u201d and believed he or she had \u201cdone everything by the book and followed the law.\u201d\n\nIn the complaint, the whistleblower, whose identity has yet to be made public, alleged that Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in order to gain an advantage in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe whistleblower noted that he or she did not acquire the information regarding the call with Zelensky and the documenting of it first hand; rather, the whistleblower wrote in the complaint, it came from \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\u201d\n\nIf true, that means that members of Trump\u2019s own staff likely leaked it.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "President Trump likened the person who leaked information to a federal whistleblower to a spy.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AOHlBWhObgFt8V0aUT86OA--~B/aD0zMzAxO3c9NDk1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3bd9f2d0-e09c-11e9-bffc-574eb4aa28f7", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
