WHO SHOULD USE PURPLE SHAMPOO? According to celebrity colorist Rita Hazan, the New York-based hair pro behind Beyonce's blonde locks, purple shampoo can be a real asset to those who struggle with brassiness. '[Purple shampoo] can help get rid of orange, brassy tones,' she told DailyMail.com, while sharing that the product is best used by those with brown or blonde hair. Colorist Larisa Love, who is a Joico Brand Ambassador, chimed in to note that purple shampoo is only truly necessary for use by those who have lightened their hair, or for those with gray or silver hair. 'Many of the best candidates for this product are those who have lightened their hair, such as color-treated blondes or brunettes who have gone blonde, that want to keep brassy or yellow tones away,' she explained, adding that anyone who has dyed their hair purple may also want to invest in order to keep their color looking fresh. 'The lighter you are the more obvious results you will see (blonde, gray or silver hair),' she noted. 'I definitely recommend purple/violet shampoo to all of my blonde clients that want a beautiful bright, cool-toned blonde.' WILL IT CHANGE THE COLOR OF YOUR HAIR? All experts agree that purple shampoo, and other purple-toned hair products, are meant to remove brassy tones, and take away any yellow or orange tint, leaving a nice, cool shade. However, celebrity hairstylist Sally Hershberger noted that anyone with very light hair, such as blondes or those with platinum locks, could notice that they start to 'pick up the purple hue', particularly if the product is over used. CAN IT DAMAGE HAIR? While the shampoo certainly has its benefits, Rita offered a warning to those who are using it again and again in the hopes of achieving a dramatic transformation to show off on social media, explaining that overuse of the product can actually cause damage to the hair. 'Overuse can make hair dull,' she revealed, adding that this warning applies particularly to those with dyed hair. Even for those with blonde hair, Rita advises only using purple shampoo once every two weeks, in order to avoid ruining the color. 'Too much purple shampoo can make colored hair lose its brightness,' she added, while suggesting that those who are eager to rid their hair of brassy or orange tones without risking over exposure to purple shampoo should try her Ultimate Shine Gloss instead. 'It will [help hair] to keep its shine, as well as rid it of brassiness,' she explained. Sally added that it isn't just purple shampoo you need to be careful about in terms of over use, telling DailyMail.com: 'Just like any other shampoo, you run the risk or drying out your hair. 'Every time you wash your hair, you are taking out the natural oils that are moisturizing your hair.' She explained that purple shampoo should only be used every so often in order to remove brassy tones from the hair, and suggested it is best used with a nourishing conditioner, like her own 24K Get Gorgeous Conditioner.", "description": "Videos involving purple shampoo - a product to remove brassiness - are going viral on TikTok as users seem to have misunderstood what the shampoo is for.
