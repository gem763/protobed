The flames were coming up from the salon compartment below, which is where the bunkroom\u2019s emergency escape hatch leads.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Mayday Audio Raises Questions About Circumstances in Dive Boat Fire \u2014 Were Passengers Trapped?\n\nHe alerted the four other crew members with him, and as the captain radioed a distress message to the Coast Guard, the team made attempts to make their way down to the salon, the report said.\n\nBecause the ladder leading down was on fire, they jumped to the main deck, with one crew member breaking his leg in the process.\n\nAt this point, the report said, the crew tried to reach the salon through a window.\n\nRELATED: Last Missing Victim from Tragic California Boat Fire Found\n\n\u201cUnable to open the window and overwhelmed by smoke, the crew jumped overboard,\u201d the report said.\n\nAfter entering the water, two crew members and the captain swam to the back of the boat, got back on board, and opened the hatch to the engine room, where they saw no fire.\n\nThey eventually launched a skiff, picked up the two crew members who were still in the water, and were rescued by a nearby boat called the Grape Escape, the report said.\n\nAP/Shutterstock More\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said the source of the fire has yet to be determined, though investigators are looking at documents from recent inspections, and have also visited a boat similar in shape and size to the Conception.\n\nThe report confirmed that there were two smoke detectors in the bunkroom where the passengers were sleeping.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times previously reported that investigators were \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the size of the ship\u2019s emergency hatch.\n\nRELATED: Nationwide Heartbreak: Remembering the 34 Victims of the California Boat Fire\n\n\u201cIt surprised me how small it was and how difficult it was to access,\u201d said Jennifer Homendy, who is overseeing the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s investigation, adding that she and the investigators also had difficulty finding a light switch.\n\nThe final victim from the tragedy was recovered from the water on Wednesday, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\n\nOfficials are still in the process of conducting DNA tests in order to confirm identities of seven of the 34 victims recovered.", "description": "Crew Members Were Sleeping When Boat Fire Broke Out: NTSB Report", "authors": ["Rachel Desantis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/92EdhajN3kPLKaqzxQFhiw--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/7094824f0b73179568e908e1471e1f0f", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
