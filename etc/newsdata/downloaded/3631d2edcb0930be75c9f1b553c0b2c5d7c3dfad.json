Yes, but it still stands. Books will be written about the rivalry between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy. Plays will be staged. Their faces will be carved into mountains.\n\nWhy, exactly? You didn\u2019t see? OK, here\u2019s the short version: at 10:29am on Wednesday morning, Rooney tweeted a long and rollicking tale of intrigue via a screenshot from the iPhone Notes app. Someone, she said, had been passing the Sun information contained in her private Instagram stories. So she set a trap.\n\nA trap? Yes. Rooney says she blocked everyone but one person from accessing her stories, and then made up a series of elaborate lies to see if they would still reach the newspaper.\n\nWhat lies are we talking about? There was a story about her signing up to Strictly Come Dancing, and one about her flying to Mexico to have gender-selection treatment for her next baby. All lies, she says, made up simply to trap the person she suspected. And the stories appeared in the paper.\n\nSo, who did she suspect? My God, this is tense. To quote Rooney\u2019s tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nOh. But that doesn\u2019t matter, because the drama has entertained us all day.\n\nReally? Oh God, yes. Within minutes of this happening, people had mocked up memes of Guess Who? boardgame boxes and Scooby Doo featuring Rooney uncovering Vardy\u2019s identity. And asking what mystery she will uncover next. It\u2019s been amazing.\n\nSo people are on Rooney\u2019s side? A million per cent. She\u2019s everyone\u2019s new hero. Wagatha Christie, they\u2019re calling her.\n\nColeen Rooney accuses Rebekah Vardy of leaking stories to Sun Read more\n\nHas Vardy responded to this? Almost immediately. In another screenshot, she denied the claims, pointed out that \u201cI\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money\u201d, and claimed that Rooney was the real villain for doing this \u201cwhen I\u2019m heavily pregnant\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced. Very few people are. But it\u2019s probably worth pointing out that Rooney isn\u2019t a legally qualified detective, so we shouldn\u2019t necessarily jump to any public conclusions.\n\nWhat about private conclusions? Are you kidding? Jump away! How could you not? This is the most entertaining thing that has ever happened in the history of the world.\n\nYes but Brexit. Listen, the planet is a cascade of unending misery right now. Two Wags having an unnecessarily public barney on the internet is exactly the distraction we all need. Give us this, you grump.\n\nDo say: \u201cColeen Rooney is the world\u2019s greatest detective.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cBut what if they both made this up to trick you into leaking it to the press?\u201d", "description": "The footballer\u2019s wife set a trap for a friend she suspected of giving stories to the press \u2013 and social media was gripped", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2a92e3786aabd54c538761ac9f6dca91b34de89/0_129_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e8c00bb51b474b16d31c6c00818542a3", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
