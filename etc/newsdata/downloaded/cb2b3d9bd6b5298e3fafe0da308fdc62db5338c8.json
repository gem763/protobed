He has had four in the 31 regular-season games since, including none this year.\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Elliott said Wednesday what asked about it. \u201cI just think you know it may be luck of the draw, something that\u2019s off about me. I\u2019ve just got to be better.\u201d\n\nElliott\u2019s last game-breaker came in the Cowboys\u2019 postseason victory over the Seahawks in January.\n\nHis longest run on 28 carries Sunday was 13 yards, but his second carry, which went for 12, could have gone for a 75-yard touchdown. It\u2019s one he wants back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a play I wish I could get back, a play that could have changed the game and a play that could have won the game,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWhen I look back on the first six weeks of the season, I need to leave Sunday not having those regrets or not having those plays that I wish I could get back.\u201d\n\nElliott said he\u2019s \u201cnot really hunting\u201d long runs, but he would love to have one.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to press it,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try too hard to create a big play. Just opportunities like [the one Sunday], just making sure I take full advantage of it so Monday, I\u2019m not regretting or thinking that I could have done something different or done something better.\u201d\n\nElliott\u2019s longest run this season is 27 yards, and his 491 rushing yards ranks sixth. Elliott won the league rushing title in 2016 and last season and led the league in yards per game in 2017 when he served a six-game suspension.", "description": "Ezekiel Elliott had five carries of 30 yards or more as a rookie in 2016.
