You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve got three matches at Wembley in the group stage is hugely exciting, so to qualify for any major tournament is a big deal, and just because to this point we\u2019ve made that look comfortable, we should never take it for granted.\n\n\u201cI can remember the last time we qualified for the World Cup, it was very flat and then we were watching France and Portugal celebrate, it seemed very strange. So, I let them all have a drink in Lithuania and we got on with it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. England Euro 2020 predicted squad Show all 23 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

You\u2019ve always got to enjoy any wins. One of the difficulties of the job is, again, we were talking about post-Kosovo, we weren\u2019t very happy. So, you win 5-3, I\u2019m miserable for a month! They get another game two days later. But, that\u2019s the standard we\u2019ve set. So, we have expectations of ourselves, and we don\u2019t expect to be doing laps of honour for qualifying. But equally, it\u2019s a step on the road and it\u2019s something that you should enjoy. So, we\u2019ve got to do it first.\u201d\n\nSouthgate said it reflects how exciting the job has become.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m enjoying the development of the team and the players because we\u2019re seeing\u2026 I think we\u2019ve been able to encourage a different style for them. It was very difficult to take over and rebuild the confidence of the team from a really difficult European Championship and World Cup.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think the team was in a confident place when we took over. Two changes of coaches in a very quick period of time. [I] needed to get to know more of the senior players better and now, of course, the majority of the squad we\u2019ve worked with for a long period of time at junior and senior level, so we know what\u2019s possible, we know the potential; they excite us, their application every day is top and they want to drive those standards themselves as well, so that\u2019s definitely more enjoyable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been one of the best jobs going in football because you\u2019re manager of your own country. There can be no bigger thrill and honour than that. Worldwide, England have always been one of the most respected football nations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has ever looked at it and said it isn\u2019t an incredible job. I think what we\u2019ve tried to do is enjoy it, and try and change the emphasis for the players so that they can enjoy it, that the shirt is one to be worn with pride but one that they feel they can really go and express themselves in,and not a burden.\n\n\u201cSo, I think you\u2019ve just got to attack challenges like that and, as you say, long term for England \u2013 whoever\u2019s in charge \u2013 because these guys who are 18, 19, I\u2019m unlikely to see all of their career out. English football, young players coming through, looks in a healthy state, but Raheem [Sterling] made the point in there: it\u2019s only when we deliver, it\u2019s only when the players deliver on big stages that we can really say that.\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s lots of good potential, we\u2019ve won youth tournaments, which is a real positive step and good for the mentality of the players. But you have to constantly deliver.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate has said his players should enjoy a celebration if they do clinch Euro 2020 qualification with victory away to Czech Republic\u00a0on Friday, arguing that such feats should \u201cnever be taken for granted\u201d.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/08/Gareth-Southgate-spoke-about-the-potential-for-racist-abuse-in-Bulgaria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
