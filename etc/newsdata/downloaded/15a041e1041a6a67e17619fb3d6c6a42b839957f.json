It\u2019s hard to say. Few typefaces are this freighted with public opinion.\u201d\n\nBut strongly held beliefs can be unifying. Holly Combs, 43, fell in love with her husband, David Combs, 20 years ago over their shared contempt for Comic Sans.\n\n\u201cHe told me it was his goal to learn every typeface, and I was like, \u2018That\u2019s so sexy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Combs said. When a local art gallery gave her a work assignment in Comic Sans, the pair bonded over their mutual distaste for what they deemed the \u201cleast thoughtful\u201d font. \u201cHe was like, \u2018What if we ban Comic Sans?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Wow, we\u2019re spending the rest of our lives together.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pair went so far as to publish an anti-Comic Sans manifesto online and began selling a line of products. They affixed stickers to walls and billboards around their hometown boasting the slogan: \u201cBan Comic Sans.\u201d\n\nBorn in October 1994, Comic Sans would now be eligible for its quarter-life crisis \u2014 if it hadn\u2019t spent its first 25 years in an identity crisis. The idea for the font came when Mr. Connare was helping to develop an easy-to-use operating system for Microsoft. While sketching a talk bubble for \u201ca cute little yellow dog,\u201d Mr. Connare had an epiphany: \u201cDogs don\u2019t talk in Times New Roman!\u201d He decided the program needed a new font, zanier and more childlike, for which he took inspiration from comic books and graphic novels.", "description": "Even the creator of the font thinks it\u2019s a joke \u2014 but he\u2019s tired of the tweets.", "authors": ["Emma Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/fashion/00COMICSANS/00COMICSANS-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
