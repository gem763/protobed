But it hinted that it won\u2019t likely cut again this year.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s move reduces the short-term rate it controls \u2014 which influences many consumer and business loans \u2014 to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%.\n\nA statement the Fed released after its latest policy meeting removed a key phrase that it has used since June to indicate a future rate cut is likely. This could mean that Fed officials will prefer to leave rates alone while they assess how the economy fares in the months ahead.\n\nThe economy is in its 11th year of expansion, fueled by consumer spending and a solid if slightly weakened job market. By cutting rates, the Fed has tried to counter uncertainties heightened by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade conflicts, a weaker global economy and a decline in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nThe third rate cut of the year has partly reversed the four hikes that the Fed made last year in response to a strengthening economy. That was before rising global risks led the Fed to change course and begin easing credit. Lower rates are intended to encourage more borrowing and spending.\n\nChairman Jerome Powell has said that the central bank\u2019s rate reductions are intended as a kind of insurance against threats to the economy. Powell has pointed to similar rate cuts in 1995 and 1998 as precedents; in both those cases, the Fed cut rates three times. He and most other Fed officials credit their rate cuts with lowering mortgage rates, boosting home sales and generally keeping the economy on track.\n\nThe Fed is also weighing the consequences of a decline in expectations for inflation. Lower inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling. This can pose a problem for the Fed because its preferred inflation gauge has been stuck below its 2% target for most of the past seven years.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump, via Twitter, has renewed his attacks on the Fed for not lowering its benchmark rate closer to zero. The president has contrasted the Fed\u2019s actions unfavorably with central banks in Europe and Japan, which have slashed their rates into negative territory. Though Trump has argued that this puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage, most economists regard negative rates as a sign of weakness.\n\nSome international tensions have eased since the Fed previously met in mid-September, which might suggest to some that further rate cuts are less necessary. The U.S. and China reached a temporary trade truce earlier this month and are working on a preliminary agreement that could be signed soon by Trump and President Xi Jinping. It\u2019s not clear, though, how meaningful such an agreement might be, and Trump hasn\u2019t dropped his threat to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods on Dec. 15.\n\nAnother source of global tension has been Brexit, which has also eased. The European Union has agreed to delay the deadline for Britain\u2019s exit from the trade bloc from Oct. 31 to Jan. 31. That postpones what could have been a hugely disruptive exit, right after the Fed meeting ended, that would likely have damaged the U.K. and European economies.\n\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and hiring remains steady, though there have been signs of a slowdown in recent data. Americans cut back on spending at retailers and restaurants last month, a worrisome sign because consumer spending is the leading engine of economic growth. Still, consumer confidence remains high, and shoppers could easily rebound in the coming months.\n\nAnd businesses have reduced their spending on industrial machinery and other equipment, mostly because the U.S.-China trade war has made them reluctant to commit to big purchases. The tariffs and retaliatory tariffs between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, have also reduced U.S. exports.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the government estimated that the economy grew at a tepid but steady 1.9% annual rate during the July-September quarter.\n\nThe job market remains sturdy, with the unemployment rate at just 3.5%, the lowest in 50 years. On Friday, the government will report on employment growth for October. Steady hiring and decent wage gains should help underpin consumer spending in coming months, keeping the economy expanding. That could keep the Fed on the sidelines.\n\nThe housing market has also improved, after slumping in 2018, thanks in part to the Fed\u2019s rate cuts. Mortgage rates have fallen more than a full percentage point from a year ago, on average, for a 30-year fixed rate loan.\n\nThat\u2019s helped boost sales of existing homes while sales of new homes have soared. Auto purchases, another interest rate-sensitive industry, have also picked up.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for the third time this year to try to sustain the economic expansion in the face of global threats.
