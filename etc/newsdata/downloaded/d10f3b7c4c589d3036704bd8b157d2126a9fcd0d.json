The three of them went absolutely mad so I came downstairs to see what was wrong.\n\n'Not much had happened at that point, so I don't know if they sensed that something was about to happen.\n\n'They were brilliant. Who knows what would have happened had they not alerted us to it.'\n\nMoments later the back of the semi-detached property - near the village of Bronwydd, near Carmarthen, Wales - was engulfed by falling rocks and mud.\n\nMr Wright added: 'Another few minutes and one of us could have been in that car, trying to move it.\n\n'I don't think anyone would walk away from that. There's probably about 30 or 40 tonnes of rock on top of it.'\n\nHaving spent three years renovating their home they now face months of fixing the damage.\n\n'This was always our dream, but on that night, when it was pitch black and the rain was torrential, it felt like it could be the end of the dream.\n\n'We didn't know at that moment if the house would still be there in the morning. But we can rebuild and we've spent too long on this house to just walk away from it.'\n\nShown is the family's Nissan X-Trail almost completely buried underneath the mass of rocks and earth\n\nLarge rocks are shown lying against the wall of the home, having smashed a wall near the kitchen window", "description": "Andy Wright, 57, was tucked up in bed when his dogs (pictured) 'started going crazy' in the early hours of the morning.
