ITV, as a major broadcasting corporation with a worldwide reach, are currently tarnishing a long-lasting legacy by using one of their highest-performing programmes as a vehicle to spread hate and intolerance.\u2019\n\nIt goes on to add: \u2018I understand that viewers are important, numbers mean business and high engagement suggests success, but are there really no other ways to achieve it?\n\nDespite Good Morning Britain\u2019s current performance, to be conscious of a majority of their viewership being sexist, racist, transphobic, and generally unwilling to accept minorities or viewpoints aside from their own is repulsive, for lack of a better term\u2026\n\n\u2018Wake up to the reality of Morgan\u2019s behaviour. Hate crimes are on the rise, transphobia and discrimination over gender identity is becoming commonplace both upon social media and in the real world, and ITV continue to sit idly and let it play out in the name of entertainment.\n\n\u2018It should be obvious by now that this has far surpassed an acceptable threshold, with Morgan\u2019s rhetoric and actions sitting firmly in dangerous territory.\u2019\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
