Don\u2019t deprive us of a chance to spring a surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we will react sharply,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said in a separate interview with the Kommersant newspaper, state-media reported. \u201cSuch impertinence cannot be tolerated.\u201d\n\nRussian officials said earlier in the week that 10 members of the country\u2019s UN delegation were unable to attend the annual meeting at the organization\u2019s New York headquarters due to having their visa applications denied by the U.S. government.\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately comment on Mr. Lavrov\u2019s latest threat. A spokesperson previously told The Washington Times that visa records are confidential and that the agency is unable to discuss individual cases.\n\nThe episode unfolded nearly a month after two American lawmakers critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s policies \u2013 Sens. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, and Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat \u2014 similarly complained about being blocked by Moscow from participating in a congressional delegation to Russia organized by members of Congress.\n\nRussian government officials previously said that the U.S. lawmakers are among Americans included on a blacklist barring them from entering the country.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
