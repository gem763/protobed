(Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nThe panicky Saturday night evacuation of a crowded suburban Washington entertainment district was apparently triggered by a boy shouting that an active shooter was present, Arlington County police said Sunday.\n\nPolice said that \u201ca thorough investigation \u2026 determined that no shooting occurred\u201d at a movie theater in Ballston Quarter mall.\n\nHowever, police said their preliminary investigation \u201csuggests that an unknown juvenile male entered a theater playing the movie \u2018IT Chapter Two\u2019 and shouted that there was a shooter, causing patrons to run from the theater yelling for people to call 9-1-1.\u201d\n\nIn the ensuing panic, police were dispatched to multiple emergency calls to the 4200 block of Wilson Boulevard at about 8:38 p.m.\n\nPatrons from the surrounding area, which includes restaurants and shops, began self-evacuating, while police locked down the theater and Ballston Quarter and started a systematic search. The search was completed in about an hour, and the garage reopened after midnight, police said.\n\n[Panic in Times Square, chaos at another Walmart: Anxiety is through the roof. So are false alarms.]\n\n\n\nAuthorities said they have found no evidence that a shooting occurred at a movie theater that\u2019s part of the mall. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nOne person suffered a minor injury while fleeing and was transported to a hospital, police said. Police directed people who left personal property to claim it through individual businesses, or if their belongings were left in a public food hall area, to call the county\u2019s emergency communications center to retrieve them from the police department.\n\nThe investigation remains active, and police asked people with information related to the incident to call the Arlington County Crime Solvers hotline at 1-866-411-TIPS (8477).\n\nThe mall is near N. Glebe Road and Wilson Boulevard, a main commercial intersection in North Arlington.\n\nSaturday night\u2019s panic marked the latest spontaneous chaos to erupt in a public place after a string of mass shootings this year in the United States, including incidents that killed seven people in drive-by assaults in Odessa, Tex., 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, nine people at an entertainment district in Dayton, Ohio, and 12 people at a municipal building in Virginia Beach.\n\nThe panic echoed a June 8 episode at Dupont Circle in Washington, when a man with a BB gun who was angry at another man for hitting his partner prompted hundreds of people to flee the Capital Pride Parade, sending crowds running through the streets, fearing an active shooter.\n\n\n\nEmergency responders walk outside where a shooting was reported at Ballston Quarter mall on Saturday.
