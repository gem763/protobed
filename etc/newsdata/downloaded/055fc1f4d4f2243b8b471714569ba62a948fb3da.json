Has it happened to the Democrats yet? I think so, yes. I think so.\n\n\u201cWhistleblower\u201d is already being enrolled in the lexicon of political disasters, and not just on account of pictures of the priapic Bill Clinton with Monica Lewinsky and featuring a rude joke about \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d (\u201cYou know how to whistle don\u2019t you? You just put your lips together and blow\u201d).\n\nNo, \u201cwhistleblower\u201d has entered the joke book of American politics because of the wild discrepancy between aspiration and reality that it represents.\n\nJust last week, an all-points bulletin was blaring from the Get Trump media and the assorted fantasists in the Democratic Party. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got him, lads. Impeachment is just around the corner.\u201d The New York Times said so. So did CNN and MSNBC. So did Nancy Pelosi, soon-to-be-former speaker of the House. Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was so certain of it that he thought he could get away with pretending to read the transcript of Donald Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president while actually just making stuff up.\n\nReally. There he was, piece of paper in hand, addressing the House Intelligence Committee (and millions of viewers at home), exuding his signature \u201cthe-President-is-not-above-the-law-deer-in-the-headlights-automaton\u201d countenance. The whole thing, Schiff said, was a \u201cmafia-like shakedown.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you,\u201d he pretended to read, \u201cto make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it, on this and on that. I\u2019m going to put you in touch with people, not just any people, I\u2019m going to put you in touch with the attorney general of the United States, my attorney general Bill Barr. He\u2019s got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him.\u201d\n\nWhen it was pointed out that Donald Trump said none of that, Schiff replied that his words\u2014his lies\u2014were a \u201cparody.\u201d Oh.\n\nAchievement Unlocked: Mental Helplessness\n\nIn general, one tends to admire perseverance. We like to think it betokens a certain seriousness of purpose. We remember The Little Engine That Could from our childhood and want to root for the blundering but stalwart underdog. \u201cI think I can, I think I can, I think I can.\u201d But in this case, the Democrats are not bringing the Christmas presents of impeachment and the destruction of a duly elected president they dislike to the boys and girls on the other side of the mountain. On the contrary, they are making fools of themselves. What we are seeing unfold before our eyes is not a reprise of The Little Engine That Could but a signal illustration of Chesterton\u2019s observation that madness means \u201cusing mental activity so as to reach mental helplessness.\u201d\n\nI do not mean to fall prey to Godwin\u2019s Law, but watching the behavior of the Democrats and their media enablers these past few years, it is hard to avoid the suspicion that that have been unduly impressed by the opinion of a former Austrian corporal that if one is going to tell a lie, one should take care that it is a big one.\n\nThe trouble is, it is not at all clear that this strategic deployment of mendacity actually works. It did not, in the end, work for the Austrian corporal. And it hasn\u2019t worked for the Democrats, their media hirelings, and their NeverTrump camp followers.\n\nBeginning in 2015 and continuing until the day before yesterday, we had wall-to-wall lies about Donald Trump \u201ccolluding\u201d with the Russians. We spent tens of millions of dollars, destroyed countless careers, and came up with zilch. There was no collusion, though not for want of intimidation, fabrication, and round-the-clock hysteria on the part of the media and damaged souls like Bill Kristol, Pastor David French, and poor Max Boot, among many others.\n\nLike so many pseudo-Hamlets, they looked around and decided that \u201cthe time is out of joint. O curs\u00e8d spite/that ever was I born to set it right.\u201d The problem is, they have no play to catch the conscience of the king. They only have made-up gossip, lies fabricated by people on the payroll of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee, hearsay, rumor, innuendo, and hate-inspired fantasy. They brought it to bear against Donald Trump during his campaign and in the first two years of his first term: nada.\n\nThey tried the same thing, twice, against Brett Kavanaugh. Again, nothing, nichts, rien. And now they are trying it yet again against the president.\n\nA Preposterous Gambit\n\nAn unnamed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d (personally, I think it is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of John Brennan or possibly Michael Avenatti) cites various rumors he has overheard second- or third-hand, writes it up as an official complaint, and the whole stinking pile of malignant calumny is carefully fed into the Trump outrage machine and takes over the media narrative for a week or so.\n\nIt is impossible to overstate how preposterous the whole whistleblower gambit is. As Sean Davis has pointed out at The Federalist, the \u201cintelligence community\u201d (another phrase that has entered the lexicon of political malfeasance) recently, and secretly, changed the rule that \u201cwhistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings.\u201d\n\nThe new rules, which were made public only after the transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was released, \u201celiminates the first-hand knowledge requirement and allows employees to file whistleblower complaints even if they have zero direct knowledge of underlying evidence and only heard about [wrongdoing] from others.\u201d Interesting, what?\n\nImpeachment frenzy cascaded over airwaves and displaced every competing story, even the exploitation of that sick child crusader Greta Thunberg, for about 48 hours. But the floodwaters are rapidly receding and the malodorous muck and detritus that has been left behind are already being subject to the sanitizing scrutiny of people who don\u2019t like being lied to.\n\nSeveral of my friends are resigned to the prospect of Trump\u2019s impeachment by the House. There is no question\u2014despite Bill Kristol\u2019s active fantasy life\u2014that the Senate will not muster a two-thirds majority to convict him and remove him from office. But, the Democrats presumably are reasoning, the very fact that a president was impeached would tarnish his reputation and diminish his chances of success in the election.\n\nI am not at all sure that is correct. It didn\u2019t happen with Bill Clinton. And beyond that, I am not convinced that the move to impeach the president would even garner the requisite 218 votes in the House. Already, pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa, you can hear the furious sounds of backpedaling as a dim consciousness of what they have done with their impeachment frenzy steals over the reptilian brains of the impeachment choristers.\n\nTicking Time Bombs\n\nBut it is actually worse than that, much worse. I think Thomas Lifson, writing for The American Thinker, is right. The whoops of the impeachment war dance are echoing in an otherwise silent and most severe chamber. All this frenetic activity\u2014the screaming front-page headlines, the salivating attacks on Trump in the now-routinely anti-Trump Drudge Report\u2014all that, as Lifson says, is but the \u201cprelude to the coming time bombs about to explode in their faces.\u201d\n\nThe bombs in question, Lifson points out, have names: Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general whose report on malfeasance in the FBI and the \u201cintelligence community\u201d is due any day; John Durham, the U.S. attorney looking into the origins of the attempted coup against Donald Trump; and John Huber, the U.S. attorney who is looking into the FBI\u2019s surveillance of Carter Page and connections between the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One scandal.\n\nThose time bombs are indeed ticking, and even the Dems must be able to make out the tick-tick-tick above the fury of their anti-Trump skirling. Some people say that what we are witnessing is just an instance of hardball politics. They hate us, we hate them, let the game begin.\n\nI think it is much worse than that. There were plenty of hints and adumbrations before, but it really took shape with Donald Trump. What we have seen over the last few years is an effort to render a large part (indeed, a majority) of the electorate illegitimate.\n\nDonald Trump won the presidency in a free, open, and democratic election. And yet a sliver of the population\u2014the Antifa thugs, the Hollywood brats, the media sissies, the beautiful people with expensive degrees, and, of course, the radical fringe of the Democratic Party\u2014all refused to accept the results of the election.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that they disliked Donald Trump. They declared him illegitimate. By implication, they declared anyone who supported Trump illegitimate, too. In essence, they bowed out of the social compact that underwrote the legitimacy of the American regime.\n\nThey adopted the extreme rhetoric and tactics of revolutionaries. \u201cJusq\u2019au-boutisme\u201d became their rallying crying: by any means necessary. Whatever it takes to rid the country of the Bad Orange Man\u2014and (often unstated but always implied) his unenlightened supporters, whose lack of enlightenment is guaranteed by their support for a man who is \u201cliterally Hitler\u201d etc., etc.\n\nDestroying the American Consensus\n\nIt is difficult to take the measure of this political wrecking ball, but of this I am confident. The only thing that might\u2014might\u2014assuage our troubled polity is a systematic exposure of the destructive tactics, motives, and political presuppositions of the anti-Trump onslaught. That exposure will require the candid scrutiny of the law, and anyone who cares about the future of American democracy can be heartened that William Barr is the attorney general. Nancy Pelosi is not, as she floated on Friday, going to be able to impeach him any more than Kamala Harris is going to be able to impeach Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nWhat has been happening these last three years is not just an effort to destroy Donald Trump. That, indeed, is merely incidental to the larger project of destroying the fundamental American consensus. I do not think it will succeed. But I am sufficiently disillusioned to realize just how grave a threat these forces pose to what we used to be able to call, without irony, the American dream.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-610598368.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
