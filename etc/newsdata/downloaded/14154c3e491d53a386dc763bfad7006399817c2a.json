A memorable highlight was the wigs, poufy creations with bangs, in shades of pink, yellow, orange, turquoise and deep blue. Another was the tall, shimmering, over-the-thigh boots in everything from metallic silver to purple to bronze to green to ice blue.\n\nScott said after the show that he\u2019d been inspired to create \u201can intergalactic imaginary synthetic pop band, a rock opera in outer space.\u201d\n\nBut the idea, specific as it was, was not triggered by any particular experience, either musical or visual, Scott said.\n\n\u201cCreativity is such an obtuse thing, you know,\u201d the designer said in a backstage interview.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know how all these ideas come to me, I just try to keep myself really open \u2026 like a vessel, to receive these inspirations. I just feel them and don\u2019t try to dissect why I am feeling colorful or not colorful or bold or \u2026 well, I\u2019m always bold,\u201d Scott said. \u201cBut as for something versus another, I just try to feel it, go with it, (be) open, embrace it and let it come in and follow the process.\u201d\n\nIt was almost, Scott said, \u201clike breadcrumbs are being left by a higher divinity.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Designer Jeremy Scott sent his models down the runway in electric hues, crystal-embedded garments, sparkly sky-high boots and brightly colored wigs, evoking what he called an \"intergalactic pop band.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jocelyn Noveck"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/fashion_jeremy_scott_42054_c0-140-3907-2417_s1770x1032.jpg?0a6849929cb503442613b064ba0418a15791d649", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
