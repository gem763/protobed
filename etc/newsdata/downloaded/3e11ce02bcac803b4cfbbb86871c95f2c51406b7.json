His current ambassador to the United Nations, for instance, is a Republican fundraiser with negligible diplomatic experience who once said there are many fine scientists on both sides when it comes to climate change. His Secretary of Education is another Republican big spender who knows zero about public education. And his personal \"lawyer,\" Rudy Giuliani, is actually more of a rodeo clown who runs in to get kicked in the face every time the bull starts bucking too hard under the president. But as of this fine Wednesday morning, it looks like The Artist Formerly Known as America's Mayor might take more than a beating for the president. He might be in some serious legal peril.\n\nIn Trumpland, after all, you either leave diminished or stay long enough to go to jail. Everyone who wanders into this president's airspace enters an escalating state of ethical and professional decay. And based on Giuliani's conduct over the last 24 hours or so\u2014the climax of months of shady, unscrupulous shit hitting the fan\u2014he may well believe the double-decker bus has swung around the corner and someone just shoved him into the street.\n\nA new report from the Washington Post, which has nailed the Ukraine story throughout, centers Giuliani in a caper wherein the State Department and other official channels were shoved aside so that the Presidential Lawyer could get up to...something...in Ukraine. Actually, we know what the something was: both Trump and Giuliani have openly admitted they pressured the president of Ukraine to open an investigation that could damage Joe Biden. This is the offense that led Nancy Pelosi to\u2014finally\u2014open an impeachment inquiry Tuesday. Anyway, here's the Post:\n\n...the person who appears to have been more directly involved at nearly every stage of the entanglement with Ukraine is Giuliani.\n\n\u201cRudy\u2014he did all of this,\u201d one U.S. official said. \u201cThis s---show that we\u2019re in\u2014it\u2019s him injecting himself into the process.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Drew Angerer - Getty Images More\n\nSeveral officials traced their initial concerns about the path of U.S.-Ukrainian relations to news reports and interviews granted by Giuliani in which he began to espouse views and concerns that did not appear connected to U.S. priorities or policy.\n\nThe former New York mayor appears to have seen Zelensky, a political neophyte elected president of Ukraine in April and sworn in in May, as a potential ally on two political fronts: punishing those Giuliani suspected of playing a role in exposing the Ukraine-related corruption of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and delivering political ammunition against Biden.\n\nAs Josh Marshall pointed out, the Manafort detail points to this being more than just Giuliani's work. What does Giuliani care about Manafort? It's Trump who cares about Manafort. Maybe he wanted something that would muddy the waters around his former campaign manager's activities in Ukraine, perhaps just enough to justify pardoning him. That would be commensurate reward for Manafort's refusal to \"break\" and properly cooperate with federal prosecutors. (Remember when the President of the Untied States used mob lingo to describe his campaign manager's Very Loyal activities?) Either way, there's ample reason to believe the president has been directly implicated in this from the beginning.", "description": "The performance, which extended from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning with a sideshow on Twitter, indicates he can feel himself becoming Trump\u2019s latest fall guy.", "authors": ["Jack Holmes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FjZx5UFPQAq4a42.yUGC4g--~B/aD0yNTE7dz01MDE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/esquire_269/528b004839c7d9651dfd51a22c8616db", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
