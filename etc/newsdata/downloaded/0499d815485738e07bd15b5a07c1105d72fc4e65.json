It was filmed inside New York\u2019s Sing Sing prison. Apparently President Trump was watching because he launched a Twitter war brought on by a bruised ego. Singer John Legend took fire and his wife Chrissy Teigen voluntarily enlisted in the battle.\n\nTrump can rightfully claim criminal justice reform as a victory for his administration. The First Step Act he signed into law seeks to reform the federal prison system by reducing mandatory minimum sentences and reducing recidivism. During the town hall special, the First Step Act wasn\u2019t included in the conversation. I didn\u2019t see the show but I assume the legislation wasn\u2019t included because the town hall centered around state and local incarceration issues. The First Step Act addresses federal prison reforms. The Washington Post reports that the legislation was acknowledged in a special re-aired before the town hall and showed Trump signing the bill into law.\n\nSinger John Legend was a guest of Holt\u2019s. He is often in the headlines for his political activism, usually criticizing President Trump and his administration. His wife, Chrissy Teigen is even more aggressive in her criticism of Trump. The two are egged on by Democrat Party leadership. I wrote about an appearance by the two celebrities at a Democrat retreat back in April at the invitation of Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPresident Trump didn\u2019t appreciate being left out of the conversation during the town hall and tweeted out his displeasure. He produced a tweetstorm.\n\n\u201cWhen all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help. I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it,\u201d Trump wrote in a series of tweets on September 8. \u201cObama couldn\u2019t come close, and many others, were profusely grateful (at that time!). I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. \u201cBut now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is\u2014but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed.\u201d Trump also hit out at Holt for failing to \u201cbring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans\u201d when discussing the passing of the Criminal Justice Reform and how all that people want to \u201ctalk about now is Impeaching President Trump!\u201d instead of his achievements.\n\nShots fired. Legend responded. He even dragged Melania into the fray.\n\nImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody\u2013ANYBODY\u2013will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nYour country needs you, Melania \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nHe also included a dumb tweet about the fuss made in the media over a kiss during a greeting between Melania and Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit.\n\nChrissy weighed in and a vulgar (even for her) hashtag was born.\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nLegend realized how foul-mouthed his wife truly is and the two sought to do a little gaslighting about it.\n\nPlease don't make this foul mouthed hashtag trend #PresidentPussyAssBitch https://t.co/TMaq58hzIx \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nSo, there we are. Just another Sunday night, right?", "description": "Legend drags in Melania, too.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1f7d27a2-45bf-4afb-bfdd-f54e6094a084.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
