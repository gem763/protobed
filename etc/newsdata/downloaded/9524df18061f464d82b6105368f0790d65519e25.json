(Photo by Gallo Images/Alaister Russell)\n\nFormer Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi is expected to return to the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture on Wednesday morning.\n\nThis comes after Armaments Corporation of South Africa CEO Kevin Wakeford was granted permission to cross-examine him and the company\u2019s former head of central business, Frans Vorster.\n\nWakeford was among many people who benefited from Bosasa, according to Agrizzi's testimony in January.\n\nSenior ANC and former government officials were also not spared by Agrizzi during his testimony. Among those he implicated were ANC chairperson and Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe, former minister Nomvula Mokonyane, former president Jacob Zuma's ally Dudu Myeni, politicians and unnamed journalists.\n\nAgrizzi testified that Mokonyane was furnished with R50 000 a month in cash from Bosasa, meat and alcohol for family functions, maintenance to her home, including a garden service, repairs to electric fencing and new camera systems.\n\nHe claimed he was present on one occasion when Mokonyane was handed a grey security bag of cash when she was Gauteng premier, between May 2009 and May 2014.\n\nBut Mokonyane claimed the allegations were false and she promised to testify at the commission.\n\nShe said the allegations were of a \"serious nature, self-contradictory in many respects and are designed to cast aspersions of impropriety against me in my personal and official capacities\", News24 previously reported.\n\nSpeaking at a memorial service for former CEO Gavin Watson on August 30, Mokonyane threatened to tell the nation what Agrizzi had done.\n\nSecurity upgrades\n\nAgrizzi also estimated that security upgrades at three homes belonging to Mantashe cost R650 000.\n\nBut Mantashe rejected Agrizzi's claims, saying he had \"no dealings with Bosasa\".\n\nIn February 2019, Mantashe went as far as inviting journalists on a tour of his homes in Boksburg, Gauteng, as well as Cala and Elliot in the Eastern Cape.", "description": "Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi is expected to return to the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8429/ec14df823acb4a39b0ea709f9c3613ac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
