MORE was leading in the polls on Election Day,\u201d said one Democratic fundraiser. \u201cI want to see this poll again when we start having people testify over the course of a few months after Republicans stay on message and use Fox News to their advantage. If by then independents are still for it, OK. But I don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d\n\nTrump and his allies have only just begun running millions of dollars worth of ads attacking Democrats for launching the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s approval rating, which has been locked in the low 40 percent range for most of his presidency, has not budged. Overall, the president maintains near universal support from Republicans in most polls.\n\n\u201cAmericans always support inquiries and investigations,\u201d said Mark Penn Mark PennPublic opinion polls show shift toward impeaching Trump Poll: Most Americans support sending troops, missile defenses to Saudi Arabia Voters evenly split on whether Trump's Ukraine actions amount to 'impeachable offense' MORE, the co-director of Harvard CAPS\u2013Harris Poll.\n\n\u201cWe see a modest uptick in [support for] impeachment but his job approval is holding steady and if people really soured on him you would see it plummet 20 points. That would be a big deal.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans are largely united behind Trump, and while a handful of GOP senators have criticized the president for his actions \u2014 led by Sens. Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyTrump defends Syria move: 'It's time to come back home' GOP senator: 'Not appropriate' to ask foreign governments to investigate Biden Senators call for Trump administration to testify on Syria MORE (R-Utah) and Ben Sasse Benjamin (Ben) Eric SasseGOP senator: 'Not appropriate' to ask foreign governments to investigate Biden Republicans urge Trump to reverse course on Syria withdrawal GOP lawmakers blast Trump's Syria decision as 'grave mistake,' 'disaster in the making' MORE (R-Neb.) \u2014 none are publicly advocating for impeachment.\n\n\u201cResearch shows opinion often follows elite signaling and the slightly less than 1 in 5 Republicans who now back impeachment are likely the kind of Trump-skeptical Republicans who public criticism from people like Romney and Sasse would motivate,\u201d said Chris Wilson, a veteran Republican pollster and CEO of WPA Intelligence.\n\n\u201cThis doesn't represent the first drip in a wave of Republicans breaking against Trump so much as it represents anti-Trump Republicans responding to elite signals.\"\n\nStill, it appears that the Ukraine controversy is beginning to test the limits of GOP loyalty toward the president.\n\nThe latest USA Today\u2013Ipsos poll found that 30 percent of Republicans view Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden as an abuse of power, with 17 percent of GOP voters supporting the House inquiry.\n\nAnd a Monmouth University survey found GOP support for the impeachment inquiry doubling month-over-month to 16 percent in October.\n\nIn the Washington Post poll, two-thirds of independents surveyed and one-third of Republicans said Trump was wrong to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden. Overall, 62 percent of voters said Trump\u2019s actions were inappropriate and 58 percent support impeachment.\n\nA strong majority of voters in most polls view Trump\u2019s conduct as inappropriate, leading Democrats to believe there is significant room for support for impeachment to grow if they continue to make the case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEvery day new pieces of this story come out and lead voters to grow warmer to the idea of impeachment,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cThis goes well beyond his stupid tweets and attacks; involving a foreign government crosses a line for a great many people.\u201d\n\nGOP leaders are working furiously behind the scenes to calm the troops and keep the party united.\n\nOn a Monday phone call with Republican lawmakers, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyHouse GOP touts poll showing impeachment advantage for Republicans Trump told Republicans he doesn't want impeachment on his 'resume': report Trump holds call with House GOP amid impeachment inquiry MORE (R-Calif.) presented data from a poll conducted on behalf of the House GOP campaign arm that has more optimistic data for the president and his allies, particularly in the battleground districts where Democrats will be on defense in 2020.\n\nThe survey of 95 battleground districts found that 67 percent of independents view impeachment as politically motivated. A GOP candidate who opposes impeachment leads a pro-impeachment Democrat 50 percent to 42 percent in the poll.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiEx-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown Former George W. Bush chief of staff endorses Trump impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Calif.) slow-walked a drive for impeachment for months over concerns it would cost the Democrats newly won House seats in districts Trump carried in 2016.\n\nThere are 44 Democrats in the party\u2019s \u201cFrontline Program\" to protect vulnerable lawmakers and 31 Democrats represent districts that Trump carried in 2016. Republicans need to flip 19 seats to take back the House in 2020.\n\nThe House GOP survey found that in districts that Trump carried in 2016 that are currently held by Democrats, the generic GOP candidate holds a 54 percent to 38 percent lead.\n\nSome Democrats, such as Rep.
