A lot of pancake mixes, for example, are perfectly fine with no additions, but adding just one extra ingredient can transform the mundane into something special.\n\nI\u2019ve been on a cottage cheese pancake rampage, but my coworker Tim recently turned me on to lemon zest pancakes, which are deceptively delicious, and extremely easy to make.\n\nJust make a batch of (approximately six or eight) pancakes however you normally would, pausing to mix the zest of an entire medium lemon into the dry ingredients before you add your wets. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all you have to do.\n\nMix up the batter, making sure to leave it lumpy, then fry \u2018em up on the griddle. The resulting pancakes are sunny and lightly lemon-flavoured, with yellow bits of funfetti-like zest distributed throughout. Rather than tasting fruity and sweet, they taste lightly floral and fancy. The zest lightens and brightens, tempering the richness of the pancake and sweetness of the syrup (or perhaps some chocolate chips).", "description": "I am an unapologetic champion of baking mixes.
