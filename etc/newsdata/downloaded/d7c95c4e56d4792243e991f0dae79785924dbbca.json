Reports said that a deal between Apple and the Irish government allowed for a tax rate of just 1 percent in 2003 and at one point in 2014, just .005 percent, far below the nation\u2019s normal rate. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent, one of the lowest in the EU.\n\nEU member nations are not allowed to offer incentives and tax rates that are not offered in other nations.\n\nRegulators from the commission will meet with the Irish government and Apple officials on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week over the tax row. All findings will be published on Sept. 24.\n\nThe charge is that Apple has paid just a fraction of what they are obligated to pay, basically diverting its European profits through Ireland and using a special deal with the government to circumnavigate the billions they allegedly owe. If the finding holds and the firm owes over $14 billion, Apple\u2019s payment would far eclipse the largest back tax payment in Ireland\u2019s history, the number 40 times greater than the previous record holder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not an uncommon practice for corporations to funnel money through certain countries with friendly tax structures to evade larger payments.\n\nOn Friday, Disney\u2019s CEO Bob Iger stepped down from Apple\u2019s board of directors at the same time that Apple TV\u2019s launch date was announced. Iger told FOX Business' Deirdre Bolton in May that he recused himself from conversations on the Apple board that might conflict with his company\u2019s vision and future such as \u201cApple Television or Apple Plus or other movies discussed.\u201d", "description": "Apple faces the possibility of paying the European Commission over $14 billion in back taxes", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Apple-grab.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
