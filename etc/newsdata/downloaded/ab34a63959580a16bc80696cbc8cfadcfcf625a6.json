Crashes are part and parcel of motorsport, but there are certain accidents where instinct kicks in and a voice is immediately heard: \u201cPeople don\u2019t walk away from accidents like that one.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTragically, so it proved. Less than an hour and a half after the crash, Hubert was pronounced dead and the motorsport world went into mourning. In one single moment, a story confined to the sport and its fans suddenly became headline news across the globe. Front and back pages included pictures and words of a young man that those newspapers had never mentioned before, news bulletins featured the words \u201ctragedy strikes Spa\u201d and other headlines to similar effect.\n\nIt is perhaps the most difficult thing in sports journalism at that point to separate the sadness from the story, and writers very much go into autopilot mode, filtering out the rumours and the false reports to bring readers only the facts. I certainly know that\u2019s what I did on Saturday. Only once the official F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile statement lands, the news is published and the tributes flow, do you really have time to take in what has happened.\n\nI did not know Anthoine Hubert, but the sight of a paddock in mourning was enough to make even the most ardent petrolheads question whether it was all worth it. However, doing something so exhilarating, so frightening and so ridiculous that it feels as though it should not be legal to do so, is integral to many fans\u2019 love of the sport.\n\nThe next day, Hubert\u2019s mother and brother were stood at the front of the F1 grid during a minute\u2019s silence, unifying the paddock in strength as 20 Grand Prix drivers prepared to hurtle towards the corner that killed him at speeds in excess of 170mph. It was the perfect reminder of why we do something we love in the knowledge of the risk involved, and it\u2019s why we will continue to do it tomorrow, and the next day, and the next.\n\nYours,\n\nJack de Menezes\n\nDeputy sports editor", "description": "Breaking a story of someone\u2019s death is never easy, no matter what area that story falls under, but there is something particularly difficult about doing so when that person is a young individual with their best years ahead of them.
