(Photo: Kelly Wang, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTiffany's latest idea for counting down to the holidays? A calendar priced at six figures.\n\nThe luxury jeweler unveiled its \"Ultimate Advent Calendar\" with unique pieces of jewelry for each day over a 24-day period. But prepare to splurge: The collection costs $112,000.\n\nThe calendar includes 24 items wrapped in the company's signature blue boxes, each ensconced within the Advent calendar that measures more than 4 feet tall, resembling its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nItems available in the calendar include an extra large smile pendant in 18-karat rose gold with diamonds, an 18-karat rose gold bracelet with diamonds, and gold earrings. You can view the complete list of items on Tiffany's website.\n\nTiffany says the Advent calendar is assembled upon delivery using its White Glove Service. Only four of the calendars are available for purchase.\n\nThis month, the jeweler launched its first collection for men, and is also expanding to home items such as cocktail shakers and beer mugs.\n\nBro bling?: Tiffany introduces men's jewelry collection\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/23/tiffany-selling-advent-calendar-priced-112000/4069894002/", "description": "Jewelry company Tiffany is selling a limited edition Advent calendar, stuffed with earrings and bracelets, but it will cost customers $112,000.", "authors": ["Brett Molina", "Published A.M.
