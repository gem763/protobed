I can walk to some of my locations. Barley Mac and Taco Rock are only two blocks from the condo.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCordero\u2019s move got him into a great position to walk to work to two of his restaurants, but it wasn\u2019t without a few hiccups. The house he was living in sold faster than he thought it would and there were no units available on the coveted upper floors of the condo building so the chef put his stuff into storage and rented living space in Rosslyn for four months.\n\nA unit he liked opened up and Cordero dropped about $1 million for 1,645 square feet complete with a balcony offering views of Georgetown University. But the interior needed work. Cordero has a personal and professional partnership with Yvette Irene 47, who has made her own splash in the interior design world by appearing on shows that aired on HGTV, the Food Network and DIY.\n\nAD\n\nIrene tweaked Cordero\u2019s house in south Arlington and designed the interiors of eight of his nine restaurants. After the partial renovation of his house and the first four restaurants, they began dating and are now engaged. Although the condo was livable as it was, the couple decided to make some changes, with Cordero playing the role of client, not fiance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI told her what I didn\u2019t like,\u201d Cordero says. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the floor, I didn\u2019t like the wall colors and I thought the ceiling was very dull. In a commercial setting I have to cater to many clients \u2014 it has to be very neutral looking. I wanted to put my personal touches, and I spare no expense to live the way I want to.\u201d\n\nRemodeling a condo is always a challenge because of the [condo association\u2019s] rules of what can and cannot be changed as well as the approval process. \u201cYou can only work from 9 to 5,\u201d Irene says. \u201cYou only use a certain elevator \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of restrictions. It prolongs the process because you have to wait for their approval.\u201d\n\nThe changes were more than cosmetic as Irene drew up plans for coffered and tray ceilings. The floor in the main living area was an area of concern as the hardwood planks ran lengthwise from the front door to the far wall. \u201cIt looked like a bowling alley,\u201d Irene says. The renovation lasted six weeks and was supposed to cost $125,000, but the budget spiraled up to $160,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of the condos in the building, including Cordero\u2019s, have semiprivate elevators that open into the units. The couple viewed the vestibule as a design challenge and untapped potential for a grand opening into the space that would go beyond the traditional layout of desk, lamp, coat rack and umbrella stand. What used to be an awkward foyer is now the chef\u2019s 500-bottle wine room.\n\nThe wine room is one of my favorites,\u201d Irene says. \u201cWhen I first saw that elevator room, I saw that as an opportunity to make it a wine room for him and he loved it. We produced a [computer-aided design] drawing of the space so we know how many bottles will fit.\u201d\n\nCordero was onboard with the idea from the beginning. \u201cSometimes I have long days in the restaurant business and, we\u2019re talking about 16-hour days, but when I get in the elevator and open it up it\u2019s such a great feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cI know all the wines, but sometimes I stop and admire the room.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust off the wine room is what used to be a den. Irene added a closet and drama by installing a tray ceiling. A convertible sofa turns the den into a guest bedroom. The kitchen came through the makeover mostly unmodified, although the chef did swap out the stove for a five-burner Viking range.\n\nThe bowling alley flooring was removed and replaced with wide-plank, naturally stained maple laid width-wide across the space. The ceiling was coffered to break up the space and to increase interest. Lighting was enhanced with dimmable pin lights that add accents where needed. Irene also created seating vignettes to provide for a variety of dining options.\n\n\u201cInstead of having the typical table and chairs behind the breakfast bar, we have three stools and a banquette on the other side of the space,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fireplace was another feature that Mike lost by moving into the condo from a single-family home, so we added one. And then you have the dining table for the proper dinner and the bar for after dinner.\u201d\n\nIrene also brought wallpaper into the mix in the living area and bedrooms. The master suite features an upholstered headboard and another tray ceiling. But even with all the improvements on the inside, Cordero\u2019s favorite space is outdoors.\n\n\u201cThe balcony is exceptional. For a condo to have a balcony where you can fit 30 people comfortably \u2014 it\u2019s like you\u2019re living in some high-rise penthouse drinking cognac and smoking cigars,\u201d Cordero says. \u201cI love it; I do a lot of my thinking out there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the topics Cordero thinks about is what\u2019s happening in his community. The Amazon effect, or at least the hype is already filtering down to Rosslyn, which is experiencing its own slate of renovations near the Metro station. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) The most visual work in progress is what\u2019s already underway in what will be known as Rosslyn City Center.\n\n\u201cRosslyn City Center will greatly transform a major urban center in Rosslyn,\u201d says Mary-Claire Burick, president of the Rosslyn Business Improvement District.\n\n\u201cPedestrians will have expanded retail options and connectivity to Central Place Plaza, where we have many new restaurants \u2014 Open Road, Salt and Common Ground \u2014 opening this fall,\u201d Burick adds. \u201cThe 40-year-old mall will be completely reimagined with a curated food hall.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCordero says he is banking on things heating up in Rosslyn and happy to finally enjoy the building and lifestyle he wanted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy the renovations going on in Rosslyn,\u201d he says. \u201cClarendon had their day, Ballston is coming up, but Rosslyn will be the next phase of Arlington, where there\u2019s going to be more restaurants, more shops. It will be like Reston Town Center.\u201d\n\nAlong with new places to eat, there\u2019s another factor in play. \u201cI walk over the Key Bridge and I\u2019m in Georgetown,\u201d Cordero says. \u201cI can get on [Interstate] 66 or it\u2019s a 10-minute Uber ride into D.C. I love the location.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Restaurateur and designer work together on a home that delivers style and comfort in an amenity-heavy high-rise tower.", "authors": ["Scott Sowers Photos Amanda Andrade-Rhoades"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JhopIzaEVRaHb3Rn8zWGPEI5OhI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4J3QV4XOHUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
