In some cases, HUD may still approach the Justice Department about a possible False Claims Act violation. And in instances where a third party alerts the Justice Department about possible violations, the two departments will coordinate their investigations.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the Justice Department reached large settlements with many lenders including Bank of America BAC, +0.40% , Wells Fargo WFC, +0.60% and JPMorgan Chase JPM, +0.40% under the auspices of the False Claims Act. The settlements were intended to resolve issues related to FHA lending activity at these banks, such as underwriting loans that did not comply with federal rules. Quicken Loans previously sued the federal government after being threatened with a fine for a supposed False Claims Act violation.\n\nAll told the Justice Department collected around $7 billion through these settlements from lenders, FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery said Monday, according to a report from housing industry news website HousingWire.\n\nBanks have largely exited the FHA market\n\nBanks previously comprised a significant share of the FHA market, but have pulled back in recent years. Back in 2010, nearly 44% of FHA mortgages were written by bank. As of 2018, depository banks only account for roughly 13% of the market.\n\nThe fear of being sued by the federal government for alleged violations of FHA regulations is what has steered banks and credit unions away from this market, Carson argued Monday. \u201cWe know that at least part of the reason for the decade-long decline in depository participation is because of uncertainty about how federal agencies apply the False Claim Act,\u201d he said.\n\nBanks themselves have echoed this sentiment. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon criticized the FHA\u2019s use of the False Claims Act (FCA) in levying fines against FHA lenders. \u201cA first step to increasing participation in the FHA program could be the communication of support for only using the FCA, as originally intended, to penalize intentional fraud rather than immaterial or unintentional errors,\u201d Dimon wrote in his annual letter back in 2017.\n\nWhile non-bank lenders \u2014 meaning mortgage companies that don\u2019t also hold consumers\u2019 deposits \u2014 have risen up to fill some of that gap, government officials have argued that banks\u2019 pull-back from this market may be hurting consumers. In particular, the pull-back has affected lower-income and first-time home-buyers who tend to seek FHA loans because they require lower down payments. It has also increased the risk to the FHA, because non-bank lenders aren\u2019t always as well-capitalized as banks that hold deposits, meaning they are more likely to suffer losses in instances where a borrower forecloses.\n\n\u201cThis trend impacts consumer access to credit and increases counterparty risk to FHA\u2019s Single Family mortgage insurance programs,\u201d the FHA said in its most recent annual report on the state of its mortgage insurance fund.", "description": "HUD, DOJ plan to issue fewer violations against major mortgage lenders under the False Claims Act.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF534_ben_ca_ZG_20190312142137.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
