On top of this, it is removing its CFO, Tyler Painter, the brother of the CEO and co-founder (and car business veteran) Scott Painter. He\u2019s being replaced in the interim by Kirk Shryoc.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people 40% translates to in terms of headcount, nor which areas of the business will be affected. Fair\u2019s CEO Painter is not disclosing the full number of employees the company has across the U.S., or which parts of the business are going to be restructured. (As a marker though, there are some 539 employees listed on LinkedIn, which would work out at about 215 people.)\n\nHe did note that the business is not planning on shuttering any specific operations: leasing services for those driving for on-demand services, and its consumer-focused service, will both remain operational, even as certain geographies and certain segments of the markets that Fair is serving are proving to be unprofitable.\n\nThis is one area where the CFO change will play.\n\n\u201cAs Fair has grown, the skill sets needed to drive the business forward change. Kirk has a decade of experience running treasury and capital markets for large fleet companies, and is well known on the capital markets side,\u201d the company said in a separate statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with him over the course of this year, and given our renewed focus on our acquisition and financing approach, now was the right time to ask him to step in to manage our upstream banking relationships and the fleet management.\u201d\n\nThe full internal memo that Painter sent out to staff is included below.\n\nPainter (the CEO) said in an interview earlier today that the reason for the move was to proactively come out to make changes to help the company become more profitable at a time when the \u201ccapital markets\u201d are focused on profitability \u2014 perhaps more than the over-focus on growth that has fueled a lot of the biggest investments in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard building a sustainable company and these are the choices you have to make,\u201d he said of the news.\n\nFair has been growing at a fast clip in the last couple of years, at a rate of 5x, Painter said. In 2018, ahead of its funding from SoftBank, the company picked up the unprofitable leasing business of Uber; and earlier this year it picked up Canvas, a car leasing business previously owned by Ford. In both cases, the terms of the deals were undisclosed.\n\nAt the time of the Canvas deal, Fair said it had about 45,000 subscribers currently in the U.S., with 3.2 million downloads across 30 markets, adding some 3,800 subscribers coming on from Canvas.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that Fair is backed by the same investor that helped propel both WeWork and Uber to giant valuations ahead of the companies seeing their fortunes change: Uber\u2019s in the public markets where it\u2019s been pounded for its losses and WeWork before it ever got to its IPO (the company had to withdraw its filing and just this week saw SoftBank scoop up 80% of its business at a cut price in order to keep the whole thing from going under).\n\nCautionary tales for Fair, which is only profitable in certain parts of its business and is now turning its attention to fixing that.\n\nPainter maintained that this was a proactive move, made not because SoftBank or another investor leaned on it to do so. It\u2019s notable that the last time the company raised equity funding was close to one year ago, so this could help put it in a healthier position were it considering to raise again.\n\n\u201cSoftbank is a big shareholder and supporting my focus, and that is the reality right now,\u201d Painter said. \u201cLeaning on us is not the term,\u201d he added in response to my multiple questions of whether SoftBank pressured it to make these changes. \u201cThey are supporting us \u2014 there is a big difference,\u201d he stressed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the world is changing and there is a lot of noise in system, but for us we are doing this proactively, on our terms. We recognise what we are seeing so we are being proactive to avoid this. We wouldn\u2019t have the ability were it not for capital partners like SoftBank. Despite all this noise they remain a steadfast believer in Fair.\u201d\n\nLast week\u2019s big story was about how Airbnb, which has reportedly been planning to go public next year, has seen a widening loss. Today\u2019s news could be a sign that we will see more of these rationalizations to come.\n\nMemo here:", "description": "As the market continues to turn against the wave of highly valued venture-backed startups operating with little end in sight to their huge losses \u2014 Uber and WeWork being two prime examples \u2014 another startup is taking a proactive step to get ahead of the story, by cutting costs and restructuring before public opinion forces [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fair-cars.jpg?w=712", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
