Unlike Silicon Valley, where equity incentive plans have become as ubiquitous as fussball tables and midday yoga sessions, the options culture has yet to take root in many European countries.\n\nOnerous tax rates and restrictions\n\nEuropean consumers and lawmakers here have long decried outsized paydays as unfair and vulgar. A few years ago the Dutch capped bonuses for bankers, money managers and other financial professionals at 20 per cent of their base salaries.\n\nEntrepreneurs must navigate onerous tax rates and restrictions that often make equity sharing and options more trouble than they're worth. When employees in Germany exercise options, they have to pay income tax on the difference between the fair market value and the strike price, and that rate runs from 14 per cent to 47.5 per cent. They also have to pay a 25 per cent capital gains tax on additional profits when they sell their shares.\n\nIn contrast, American employees typically pay a 0 per cent to 20 per cent rate on capital gains when options are redeemed, though they may have to pay additional levies when they're exercised, depending on the timing and the type of equity incentive program.\n\nFor entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, the problem isn't just about attracting top talent. The compensation bind may also be a big reason why Europe doesn't produce world-beating tech companies at the same level as the US.\n\n\"There are two ingredients to growth in a startup,\" says Martin Mignot, an Index Ventures partner. \"One is capital, and the other is talent, and when you're not highly profitable you have to incentivise employees on the promise of the upside. Your currency is that promise.\"\n\nSpotify, Klarna and TransferWise lead a roster of European companies that have shaken up industries with new products and created wealth for their investors and employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet they're the exceptions. In many other European markets, startup founders have to use various workarounds to vest employees in their businesses. In Sweden, options can be taxed as income at rates of more than 50 per cent. Klarna, a digital payments powerhouse, sidesteps the bill by issuing warrants priced at fair market value using the Black-Scholes model, which are taxed as capital gains at 25-30 per cent at the time of sale. But, as incentives, fully-priced warrants aren't as potent as cheaper-priced options, Knut Frangsmyr, Klarna's chief operating officer, says.\n\n'The economy of the last century'\n\nIn Germany, at least, help may finally be on the way. Bettina Stark-Watzinger, chairwoman of the Finance Committee in the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, has crafted legislation that would cut the tax rate on stock options in half by treating them as capital gains instead of income. Stark-Watzinger, a member of the centrist opposition Free Democratic Party, argues that Germany has become complacent about supporting digital innovation.\n\nShe worries that promising tech companies will decamp to other countries if lawmakers don't change things. \"We are so preoccupied with the economy of the last century,\" Stark-Watzinger says in her office suite near Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate.\n\nIt won't be easy for Stark-Watzinger to persuade parties in Germany's governing coalition to embrace legislation that might be seen as favouring workers in the relatively well-off tech sector. Germany has been far less comfortable than the US and the UK about carving out exceptions in its tax system for specific sectors, even to stimulate innovation, says Michael Mandel, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington who has studied the issue.\n\nMandel says that just because Washington is willing to bet that forgoing tax revenue now will result in bigger inflows later, that doesn't mean Berlin should. \"Germany has a very successful industrial system, so why should they break something that's working?\" he says. \"And while German leaders would love to have more unicorns, they might want to develop them their way, not the Silicon Valley way.\"\n\nEven so, there's little doubt that stock options have fueled wealth and innovation in the US companies such as PayPal, the online payments pioneer, haven't just made their founders wildly rich; members of the so-called PayPal mafia like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman went on to start ventures that minted fortunes for rank-and-file employees who can then start their own companies and begin the cycle anew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetYourGuide's Reck, for one, is relieved the issue is finally on the agenda. In many respects, his company looks like a classic Valley performer. It's backed by SoftBank Vision Fund, and in September it moved its headquarters into a renovated electrical substation that's a model of post-industrial hipness, with exposed red brick walls, cast-iron beams, and fridges stocked with high-caffeine Club-Mate drinks.\n\nEven though Reck was determined to add the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance \u2013 options \u2013he gave up after realising that the upfront tax bill would empty workers' pocketbooks. So he implemented ersatz shares that are essentially cash awards tied to GetYourGuide's valuation.\n\nThose payouts are taxed as income, but only when they're redeemed, and there's no capital gains tax. But GetYourGuide, which isn't profitable yet, must reserve cash to cover the outlays. \"This has massive disadvantages for the company,\" says Reck. \"We have a huge liability on our balance sheet toward employees, which is obviously weird. And in an IPO scenario, this is something that you have to explain to investors, and that's not great.\"\n\nBiting the bullet\n\nRaisin, another startup, did bite the bullet, granting stock options to its employees. Located in Prenzlauer Berg, a Berlin neighborhood of funky cafes and old Soviet-style apartment buildings, Raisin runs an online \"deposit marketplace\" that matches European savers with banks offering the best interest rates. Backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and PayPal, it's invested \u20ac16 billion ($17.7 billion) in assets.\n\nScott Chacon is an American entrepreneur who co-founded the software development site GitHub Inc. He's been spending time in Berlin with his latest venture, an online language-tutoring service called Chatterbug Inc.\n\nChatterbug chose to base itself in San Francisco and Berlin to tap into the German capital's diverse expatriate pool. It offered employees a choice of US-style options or German-style virtual shares. But ensuring the different programs were equitable was impossible. Chatterbug now offers new employees restricted stock units that aren't pegged to a strike price (as options are) and are taxed as income if they're cashed in during a sale of the company.\n\nStanding alongside Chacon, Anne Leuschner, the company's COO, chimes in. She says Chatterbug's compensation fudge isn't ideal, but it'll do for now. \"I wish we had the same system as the US,\" she says. \"But they don't want us to get rich in Germany.\"\n\nBloomberg", "description": "For decades, tech mavens in the US have used stock options for employees to spur innovation and unprecedented wealth but it's a different story in Europe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6639%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_423%2C$y_550/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/56b637bd84d0a113547e0e761a0528f86bef8653", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
