OK, somebody can score an equaliser, but it does not mean we cannot win the game any more. These are the things we have to keep. We all worked for it and deserve it and earned it all together but cannot take it for granted.\u201d\n\nRe-energising Anfield was part of the strategy from day one, whether it was the manager claiming he felt \u201calone\u201d when fans left prior to the final whistle before his first home loss in 2015 (coincidentally also against Palace), or inviting ridicule when ordering players to link arms and thank the Kop for staying with the players after a late equaliser against West Bromwich Albion later in that debut season.\n\nThese moments were a means to an end, serving the romantic notions of the 12th man. But the loudest venues are useless without a top-class side.\n\n\u201cWe do not do it only in home games, but have this run because we put in a specific mix of attitude and the potential of the boys, plus the crowd,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThat can make life difficult.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we have to respect and use is the good things we do in home games. We just go for it. The numbers \u2013 if you did not tell me what they were, I would not remember. It is not important. This is how you do it in sports.\n\n\u201cIf you win the gold medal at the Olympic Games, you don\u2019t win the gold medal again next time because you won it last time. You win it because you ran quicker than the others again. That is exactly how sports work.\u201d", "description": "It was a little after 6.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe", "Sam Dean", "Jamie Carragher", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000211786017-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqmRnaWIkzDVpCKltYOKrpmcLIczUCHTSM0F8Rd7epHWk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
