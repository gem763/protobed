I nearly dropped Lola from my lap,\u201d said Barki. \u201cA researcher can never take his eyes off the job, even when watching Christmas movies at home.\u201d\n\nThe painting disappeared in the 1920s, but Barki recognised it immediately even though he had only seen a faded black-and-white photo from an exhibition in 1928.\n\nThe big-eyed children: the extraordinary story of an epic art fraud Read more\n\nHe sent a flurry of emails to staff at the film\u2019s makers, Sony Pictures and Columbia Pictures, and received a reply from a former set designer on the film \u2013 two years later.\n\n\u201cShe said the picture had been hanging on her wall,\u201d Barki said.\n\n\u201cShe had snapped it up for next to nothing in an antiques shop in Pasadena, California, thinking its avant garde elegance was perfect for Stuart Little\u2019s living room.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Sony, she sold the painting to a private collector who has now brought the picture to Budapest for sale by auction.\n\nBer\u00e9ny, the leader of a pre-first world war avant garde movement called the Group of Eights, fled to Berlin in 1920 after designing recruitment posters for Hungary\u2019s short-lived communist revolution in 1919.\n\nIn the German capital, he had a romance with the actor Marlene Dietrich, and \u2013 according to Barki \u2013 is also rumoured to have had a fling with Anastasia, the mysterious daughter of Russia\u2019s last tsar, Nicholas II.\n\nBer\u00e9ny\u2019s painting will be sold on 13 December, with a starting price of around \u20ac110,000 (\u00a387,000), staff at the Virag Judit auction house said.\n\nAccording to Barki, the buyer at the 1928 exhibition, who was possibly Jewish, is likely to have left Hungary before or during the second world war.\n\n\u201cAfter the wars, revolutions and tumult of the 20th century, many Hungarian masterpieces are lost, scattered around the world,\u201d he said.", "description": "Researcher spots Sleeping Lady with Black Vase by Robert Bereny being used as a prop in Hollywood children\u2019s movie", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Budapest"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/27/1417112053124/da55bcb8-cd42-4f13-861a-d346f664d344-540x324.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a3dd37806741377c36704df61dff81fa", "published_at": "2014-11-27"}
