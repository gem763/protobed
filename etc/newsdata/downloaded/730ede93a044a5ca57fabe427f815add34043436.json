The crown prince plans to list 5% of Aramco, through a domestic and a later planned international listing, to raise billions of dollars to diversify Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy from its dependence on oil. Until recently, progress has been fitful.\n\nThe prospectus, which will be published in Arabic on Oct. 25 and in English two days later, according to a document outlining the timeline seen by The Wall Street Journal, will be used to market the shares of the state-owned company. This will precede a book-building process in November during which Aramco will test interest in the company\u2019s shares, the people said. A decision on whether to go ahead would likely be made after the book building.\n\nThe response of investors during the roadshow will inform the final offer price of the shares and whether the current sole shareholder \u2014 the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \u2014 decides to move forward with listing 1% to 2% of the company domestically, they said.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\nWhite House says it won\u2019t cooperate with impeachment inquiry.\n\nTesla needs its battery maker.
