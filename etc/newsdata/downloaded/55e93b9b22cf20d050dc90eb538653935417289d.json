Tracy spent months searching for answers \u2014 refusing to believe that her beloved dad was the one responsible for the factory blaze \u2014 and the truth finally came to light last week, when she discovered that Kerry was the one who started the inferno \u2014 a fact which ultimately makes her responsible for Frank\u2019s death.\n\nAfter a confrontation between the pair, Kerry was left seriously injured and taken away to the hospital. With Tracy riddled with guilt over her actions, she has been unable to inform the police about what Kerry did to her dad, and \u2014 tonight \u2014 she made yet another attempt to do so, but was unable to turn Kerry in, as it would leave Amelia without a parent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Kerry finally having come round, Vanessa wasted little time in marching round to hospital to have it out with her dad\u2019s killer. The pair argued \u2014 and Vanessa grew increasingly angry \u2014 and when a nurse tried to get her to calm down, she accidentally knocked the nurse into the wall, resulting in her getting arrested.\n\nLater, at the police station, an irate Vanessa attempted to explain her actions, and \u2014 as she was put into a cell \u2014 she shouted at the top of her lungs about how she has a very good reason to be so angry. It\u2019s pretty clear that she\u2019s threatening to reveal the truth about Kerry.\n\nWill she perhaps take advantange of her time in the police station and reveal what she knows about the fire?\n\nMeanwhile, Kerry and Amy (Natalie Ann Jamieson) pondered over whether or not Vanessa would reveal everything \u2014 and the worry was extremely evident on their faces.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Wednesday 9th October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Vanessa holds all the cards \u2014 but will she reveal what she knows about Kerry?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/08_10_emm_vanessa_arrest_01-60bb-e1569252077157_1570527975.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
