The audition process was intense.\n\nThey ask you to perform acting challenges, sending you scripts. You have sewing challenges, taking them through the process and the idea for your outfit. You have to be prepared for runway, with 10-14 looks.\n\nI doubt there is any show out there with an audition process this rigorous. That is why every season is more and more polished than the one before it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally made it onto the show, RuPaul said he\u2019d been watching me for three years, waiting for me to get to the perfect stage to appear on the show. It really is all about timing.\n\nBut back to the werk room. Stepping into it is like stepping into another world and you just think \u2018let\u2019s make some really great TV.\u2019 You\u2019re surrounded by your sisters (and in our case, Lady Gaga) who you share a special bond with.\n\nI\u2019m still in touch with pretty much all the queens from my series: Sasha, Farrah, Alexis, Nina, Jaymes Mansfield and Peppermint.\n\nIt was winning my first challenge that was the best bit of the show for me, though. Sasha and I were both crowned winners for our performance on \u2018Good Morning Bitches\u2019, the challenge where we had to act as presenters on an early morning TV talk show.\n\nThen when I went on to win three more (the first queen of colour to win that many challenges). I felt validated, like all my hard work had paid off.\n\nThe worst bit of the series was definitely the Gayest Ball Ever episode, where we had to create three looks (rainbow she better do, sexy unicorn and Village People eleganza extravaganza), celebrating queer culture. There was also a rhythmic gymnastics aspect.\n\nI haven\u2019t actually managed to watch my series back \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to do. Watching yourself is a really confronting and strange experience. You think \u2018do I really sound like that?\u2019 \u2018Do I really make that face?\u2019. The only bits I can manage to watch through is where I\u2019m acting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s one of the lessons Drag Race has taught me \u2013 and one I would pass on to the Drag Race UK queens.\n\nJust like in my season, I think it\u2019s too early to tell who is going to be strong competition and I don\u2019t want to place premature bets.\n\nBut I have met a handful of the queens before and I know they are going to deliver. I\u2019ve toured with Cheryl Hole \u2013 she is a riot, kind and fun. Blu Hydrangea I met at Dublin Pride and Gothy Kendoll at New York Drag Con. With both of them I was taken aback by their beauty.\n\nThe queens of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK(Picture: BBC/ Leigh Keily / Matt Burlem)\n\nMy advice to all the UK queens is to have a lot of fun, don\u2019t take yourself too seriously and be there for each other. Most importantly: don\u2019t read the comments.\n\nAs my mom always says: \u2018You can be the sweetest, juiciest peach but you\u2019ll always meet somebody who doesn\u2019t like peaches.\u2019\n\nTrolls want to be seen. They have an ego and search for validation \u2013 when you engage you give them that validation.\n\nBut in terms of challenges \u2013 the most notorious being Snatch Game \u2013 my advice is to just give into the character. Don\u2019t overthink it as it will only slow you down.\n\nIn my season I did Naomi Campbell. I was at my first Drag Con on a panel when an audience member told me she had replied on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI literally burst into tears and forgot everything going on around me. Her comments meant everything to me. She is a goddess in my opinion and has been an inspiration since I was four. In my mind she can do no wrong.\n\nDrag has the power to change lives. I applied for the show because I wanted to share my art on a bigger platform, and it did that for me.\n\nBut in a wider sense, people are looking for an outlet and drag does nothing but encourage self expression and identity.\n\nPolitically \u2013 especially in the US \u2013 people just want to be seen and heard and nothing is louder than drag. It allows us to be bold.\n\nAs for whether I would go on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All Stars, I guess we\u2019ll just have to see.\n\nI\u2019ve been rumoured to be on season five \u2013 just as I was on season four \u2013 and all I have to say is that rumours are rumours for a reason.\n\nYou can follow Shea on Instagram and Twitter, and find their website here.\n\nMORE: RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK bursting with \u2018sophisticated filth\u2019 as bosses confirm we\u2019re \u2018dirtier\u2019 than American stars\n\nMORE: Strictly\u2019s Michelle Visage supported by BFF RuPaul and it\u2019s the crossover we needed\n\nMORE: Slay away in these fierce RuPaul themed Primark pyjamas", "description": "Shea Coulee tells Metro.co.uk about their time on RuPaul's Drag Race ahead of the show's UK premier", "authors": ["Shea Coule\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shea-coulee-main_1570137730.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
