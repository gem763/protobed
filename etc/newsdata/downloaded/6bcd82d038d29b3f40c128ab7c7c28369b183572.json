Did the Fed have a \u201cbias\u201d on which way rates would move next? He answered: \u201cWe made one decision, to lower the federal-funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\u201d\n\nThe immediate reason for this studied unhelpfulness is that the principal risk to the economy\u2014a trade war between the U.S. and China\u2014is impossible to forecast. But there is a larger purpose too: talking less about the Fed\u2019s intentions minimizes miscommunication while maximizing flexibility when economic and trade-war developments change.\n\nMany of Mr. Powell\u2019s hardest moments have come from when he sought to elaborate on the Fed\u2019s plans, triggering backlash in the markets: Rates were \u201ca long way from neutral,\u201d balance sheet shrinkage was on \u201cautopilot,\u201d and July\u2019s cut was a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment.\u201d The descriptions weren\u2019t wrong or misleading, but turned Mr. Powell into a target when markets didn\u2019t like the answer, or when events forced him to change course.\n\nGenerations ago central bankers avoided scrutiny by saying nothing. \u201cNever explain, never apologize,\u201d was the Bank of England\u2019s unofficial motto. That began to change in the 1990s as the Fed and other central banks decided that explaining what they did and why both delivered accountability, and ensured markets worked with, rather than against, monetary policy.\n\nTransparency morphed into \u201cforward guidance,\u201d such as biases on the central bank\u2019s next move, and eventually broad descriptions, charts and quasi-commitments about the path rates would follow.\n\nYet there is such a thing as talking too much. If transparency got markets better aligned with the Fed, it also accentuated the damage if markets misunderstood, or if events turned out differently than expected.\n\nMr. Powell is looking for the right balance between transparency and ambiguity.\n\nHe will no doubt return to forward guidance if the course of action is obvious or markets have seriously misread the Fed.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should the Fed chairman be less forthcoming about future decisions? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nNor is it possible, or even desirable, to clam up. The public demands much more transparency from the Fed than in the 1980s. Mr. Powell gives eight televised news conferences a year. He and his colleagues give countless speeches and interviews. You can\u2019t talk that much without occasionally saying something you regret (ask Joe Biden ).\n\nThen there is the \u201cdot plot,\u201d the quarterly schematic showing where every member of the Federal Open Market Committee expects rates to be over the next three years. Absent other guidance, markets will assume that is what the Fed will do next.\n\nMr. Powell\u2019s response Wednesday was to subtly suggest the dot plot be ignored. It didn\u2019t represent \u201chardened views or a prediction.\u201d Indeed, he returned to the posture he struck at his first press conference, early last year, when he turned aside questions about the dot plot by saying: \u201cWe made one decision at this meeting.\u201d\n\nWrite to Greg Ip at greg.ip@wsj.com", "description": "By refusing to elaborate on what the Fed will do next, Chairman Jerome Powell leaves less room for misinterpretation and forces the market to think for itself.", "authors": ["Greg Ip"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108519/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
