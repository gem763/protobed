So if this officer's brother were to assault his own wife and that officer happens to be at an accident his brother is in and checks and sees that the brother has a warrant out for his arrest for domestic battery then the officer can choose to not act on it? I don't see how they can tell them to act on some warrants and not others. That is letting the officers decide which to pursue and which to not. Do we, as a society, want officers to have that type of discretion? I always thought justice was supposed to be blind, not discretionary.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NpSoVHvGxoPv_YrnLJjVyw--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MTIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cr_fashion_book_791/5bbbf3727ec4837085791879f9c1b35d"}
