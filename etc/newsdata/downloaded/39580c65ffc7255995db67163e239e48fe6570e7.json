Chris Daughtry? Our best guesses on the celebrities in disguise.", "language": "en", "text": "As host Nick Cannon said at the top of the show, it\u2019s a bit more challenging to tell just who is under the masks this season. Here are our best guesses on the famous faces behind this season\u2019s crop of mystery performers. (Spoiler alert: We\u2019ll update this post as the other celebrities are revealed.)\n\nButterfly\n\nWhat we know about them: \u201cLike a butterfly, for the past year I\u2019ve been waiting patiently in my cocoon for the promise of metamorphosis,\u201d the Butterfly told us from behind its iridescent costume. The masked celeb referenced achieving \u201csuccess in many stages of life\u201d and being \u201cterrified by the one place I used to call home\u201d \u2014 as a photo of London\u2019s Big Ben flashed on the screen. Before taking the stage to perform a powerhouse cover of \u201cBang Bang\u201d (by Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj), the Butterfly promised: \u201cI\u2019m here to take you to church \u2014 can I get an amen?\u201d\n\nWhat the judges thought: \u201cThat was electrifying,\u201d Nicole Scherzinger said. The former Pussycat Doll and Jenny McCarthy agreed Butterfly is a singer and spent a great deal of time debating whether she is young or \u201colder.\u201d Camera flashes in Butterfly\u2019s intro package led Scherzinger to think of model turned actress Cara Delevingne. Butterfly\u2019s voice made McCarthy think of someone else: singer and \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d alum Fantasia. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s kind of throwing me is that she\u2019s from somewhere else,\u201d McCarthy said, alluding to the Big Ben photo in Butterfly\u2019s intro package. Scherzinger also threw out the name of a \u201cmore seasoned\u201d legend: Diana Ross. Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong just seemed stumped.\n\nPrevailing social media theories: Michelle Williams, of \u201cDestiny\u2019s Child\u201d fame; Jessie J\n\nOur guess: The soulful voice and church reference makes us think of Williams.\n\nThingamajig\n\nWhat we know about them: Thingamajig\u2019s intro package sounded like a riddle: Hello, all, how you do? What is a Thingamajig? What does it do?\u201d From behind a feathery disguise, Thingamajig told us they are \u201cmore than fashion shoots and dreams.\u201d And Thingamajig alluded to multiple talents: \u201cAll the stars led to this gig. I\u2019m the singing, dancing Thingamajig.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t get much from his brief exchange with Cannon, who asked the question on all of our minds. \u201cA Thingamajig,\u201d is, apparently, \u201ca thing that likes to majig.\u201d\n\nWhat the judges thought: The panel was blown away by Thingamajig\u2019s soulful rendition of \u201cI\u2019m Easy\u201d by the Commodores. \u201cThingamajig, you\u2019re so whatchamacallit,\u201d Jeong joked before admitting he had not been expecting to hear such polished vocals. \u201cYou might not be known for being a professional singer,\u201d Scherzinger piped, \u201cbut you have a really natural voice and you have a beautiful tone.\u201d\n\nThough a reference to \u201ca magic case\u201d in Thingamajig\u2019s intro package got the panel thinking of a magician, the judges concluded that Thingamajig \u2014 who towered over the \u201cabout 6-1\u201d Cannon \u2014 is probably an athlete. His intro package referenced the number 4, which the judges took to be a jersey number. Thicke said Thingamajig\u2019s swagger made him think of a cross between Larry King and a Muppet (we have no idea what this means) and suggested he could be NFL star turned media personality Michael Strahan. Other panel guesses included Dennis Rodman. (\u201cHe\u2019s in North Korea,\u201d McCarthy asserted.) The judges were torn between \u201clean basketball player\u201d and football player.\n\nPrevailing social media theories: Wayne Brady, of \u201cWhose Line Is It Anyway?\u201d fame; NBA player Iman Shumpert; Indiana Pacers Victor Oladipo\n\nOur guess: Oladipo. The Silver Spring, Md., native has posted soulful covers to YouTube. He also happens to wear a No. 4 jersey with the Pacers.\n\nSkeleton\n\nWhat we know about them: \u201cI have no fear of death and I don\u2019t overeat,\u201d Skeleton told us with a raspy laugh. He mentioned having played \u201csecond fiddle,\u201d promising to \u201cknock 'em dead\u201d once he had \u201cthe spotlight.\u201d And he certainly got our attention with a melodic rendition of Sugar Hill Gang\u2019s \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight.\u201d After his performance, Cannon asked why Skeleton shakes his bones, and Skeleton explained it\u2019s because he has \u201cno booty to shake.\u201d A perfectly normal exchange!\n\nWhat the judges thought: \u201cI\u2019m getting Vegas vibes,\u201d Scherzinger said. The panel agreed Skeleton is probably a comedian. \u201cLike a drunk Ken Jeong at a wedding,\u201d Thicke said. The panel threw out Jon Cryer, Nathan Lane and Dana Carvey (he did say \u201cParty on,\u201d Cannon chimed in). Jeong, meanwhile, put his bets on one of his comedy idols. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely Martin Short,\u201d the doctor turned comic declared. \u201cI know it in my bones.\u201d But a smackdown-round performance of \u201cHard to Handle\u201d by the Black Crowes added yet another layer to the Skeleton\u2019s disguise. \u201cHe\u2019s soulful!\u201d Scherzinger declared.\n\nPrevailing social media theories: Short.\n\nOur guess: We can\u2019t believe we\u2019re saying this, but Short? This one is tough.\n\nLadybug\n\nWhat we know about them: Ladybug referenced a \u201clifetime of drama,\u201d and having been \u201cborn into the limelight.\u201d Her intro package also alluded to several game shows as Ladybug recalled \u201cspinning my wheels\u201d and a family feud. \u201cI\u2019m here to perform on my own terms without fear of being judged,\u201d she told us before singing Bonnie Tyler\u2019s \u201cI Need a Hero.\u201d She later told the judges: \u201cI\u2019ve been through so much in my life that I just feel so lucky to be here.\u201d\n\nWhat the judges thought: The panel loved her song choice. \u201cI grew up on that,\u201d Thicke said. They agreed she might be a professional singer. Thicke thought of Lily Collins, daughter of Phil. McCarthy brought up Willow Smith, daughter of Will and Jada. \u201cI think you\u2019re a performer who happens to sing very well.\u201d Jeong guessed. \u201cMaybe a Lindsay Lohan.\u201d After detecting a Southern accent, Scherzinger threw out another erstwhile singer from a famous family: Jamie Lynn Spears.\n\nPrevailing social media theories: Spears. Susan Lucci. Kelly Osbourne.\n\nOur guess: Spears, but we\u2019re not totally convinced.\n\nRottweiler\n\nWhat we know about them: They put a lot of stock in their appearance \u2014 Rottweiler talked about a love of fashion in his intro package. He also mentioned pigskin and Friday night lights (or is it \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d?). Rottweiler told us he was bitten by a Rottweiler as a kid, inspiring the unusual costume choice. He also told Cannon that he\u2019s \u201cloyal\u201d and \u201cfierce\u201d with a \u201cbit of a wait-and-see attitude.\u201d\n\nWhat the judges thought: The panel agreed they were about to see an athlete and not a \u201cprofessional singer\u201d \u2014 until Rottweiler stopped the show with his rendition of \u201cManeater\u201d by Hall & Oates. \u201cI\u2019m so confused right now,\u201d McCarthy confessed. By the end, Scherzinger declared Rottweiler her favorite. Jeong told him: \u201cYou\u2019re a star underneath that dog mask. We just have to figure out who that star is.\u201d Thicke said he was lost, but threw out a name anyway: Russell Wilson (\u201cHe might be able to sing. He\u2019s with Ciara,\u201d Thicke reasoned). The panel then turned its focus to Boy Band members: Brian Littrell of the Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync\u2019s JC Chasez and Nick Lachey.\n\nScherzinger, meanwhile, upped the ante \u2014 and vocal range: \u201cI was like, \u2018Bruno Mars come out here!\u2019 \u201d\n\nPrevailing social media theories: A good deal of social media users are convinced Rottweiler is \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d alum Chris Daughtry.\n\nOur guess: Who are we to argue with Daughtry fans?\n\nTree\n\nWhat we know about them: Tree\u2019s intro package focused an awful lot on being known for one thing and being thought of only once a year \u2014 a theme that was paired with Yuletide images. She also used the phrase \u201cgetting dolled up.\u201d\n\nThen she performed \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d by Panic! at the Disco.\n\nWhat the judges thought: \u201cIs it Martha Stewart?\u201d Scherzinger wondered. Jeong thought she must be \u201cfamous for something Christmas\u201d \u2014 Beverly D\u2019Angelo, he offered. McCarthy suggested Wendi McLendon-Covey (of \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d and \u201cBridesmaids\u201d fame). She also threw out Zooey Deschanel, whose voice was ruled \u201ctoo smoky\u201d by Scherzinger. Scherzinger also pointed out that Tree\u2019s intro package included several culinary references \u2014 \u201cdelicious treats,\u201d among them \u2014 which made her wonder if Rachael Ray could be behind the mask. Thicke said he loved how committed Tree was to her character.\n\nJeong, meanwhile, guessed Tree was older than ... well, we never found out because the Tree started dancing in a way that made the comedian backtrack: \u201cYou\u2019re a young millennial tree. I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\n\nPrevailing social media theories: Ray; Ayesha Curry (eagle-eyed viewers noted a prominently displayed \u201c30\u2033 in the Tree\u2019s intro package, which could be a reference to Steph Curry\u2019s jersey number.\n\nOur guess: Curry seems to be a promising guess. But honestly, we\u2019re stumped.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe 37 actors you probably think have an Oscar (but inexplicably don\u2019t)\n\nDolly Parton on 'I Will Always Love You\u2019 is the great tearjerking high point of \u2018Country Music\u2019", "description": "Two singers were unmasked in the Season 2 premiere of Fox's wacky reality show.
