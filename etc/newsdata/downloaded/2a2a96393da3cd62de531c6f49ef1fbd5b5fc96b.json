The airline still had several flights in the air as of Sunday night, but was expected to cease operations once they landed at their destinations.\n\nAround 600,000 Thomas Cook customers were reported to be traveling, of which were 150,000 British and were abroad, scheduled to fly home with Thomas Cook, according to reports.\n\nThe British Department for Transport and Civil Aviation Authority prepared plans, under the code name \"Operation Matterhorn,\" to repatriate stranded passengers. However, travelers face delays of up to two weeks, according to the Telegraph.\n\nThe scale of the task has reports calling it the \"largest peacetime repatriation effort\" in British history.\n\nCosts of the flights were expected to be covered by the ATOL\u2014 or Air Travel Organiser's License \u2014 protection scheme, a fund which provides for repatriation of British travelers if an airline ceases operations.\n\nAirplanes from British Airways and easyJet would be among those transporting stranded passengers home, according to the Guardian, as well as chartered planes from leasing companies and other airlines. Thomas Cook Airlines' destinations included parts of mainland Europe, Africa, the US, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. Airplanes were being flown to those destinations on Sunday night, according to the BBC.\n\nRead more:Singapore Airlines, one of the most ritzy airlines in the world, is partnering with a high-tech urban farm to make sure it serves the best meal on every flight. Take a look inside the futuristic operation.\n\nThe company was still selling tickets until Sunday night in the UK.\n\nOne Plymouth, England-based traveler, who had booked a holiday to the Greek island Zakynthos for August 2020, told Business Insider that she saw Thomas Cook had charged her more than \u00a3600 by direct debit on Sunday afternoon for the trip \u2014 she said that she was not due to be charged until September 26th. It was unclear whether she would be able to recoup the funds with the bankruptcy declaration.\n\nOn Sunday, the holiday company was left scrambling to secure \u00a3200 million \u2014 about $249 million \u2014 in emergency funding following a demand from its lenders. The company's executives were believed to have met Sunday with its biggest shareholder and creditors at a London law firm, according to Sky News and iTV.\n\nReports indicated that the tour operator failed to secure the needed funds during the meeting.\n\nAlthough Thomas Cook had reached an agreement for a \u00a3900 million rescue deal, with Chinese company Fosun Tourism Group providing half of that funding, creditors had demanded the British company secure an additional \u00a3200 million.\n\nThomas Cook owns a Nordic operation, as well as airlines in the UK, Germany and northern Europe \u2014 proposals to fund those, while letting the UK tour operating arm fail, were deemed unfeasible, according to Sky News, as have several other options which would take too long to implement.\n\nThomas Cook, as well as a union representing some of its 9,000 UK employees, had sought an emergency funding plan from the British government. However, government sources \"had questioned the financial wisdom of stepping in to save the company,\" according to the BBC. The company employs 21,000 globally.\n\nThe company had filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US last week, although it stopped short of declaring insolvency.\n\nAlthough Thomas Cook had managed to recover from a risk of insolvency in 2011, it continued to be held back by lingering debts. It also suffered by lower demand over the past two summer travel season, as major heatwaves led many Britons to stay home. Brexit uncertainties and a weak pound also contributed, according to the Telegraph.", "description": "The 178-year-old tour operator failed to secure a \u00a3200 million rescue on Sunday, leading it to suspend its flights and bookings.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d880afa2e22af02343d2962-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
