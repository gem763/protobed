She will be a 42-year-old mother of two by the time the Tokyo Games begin, but she isn\u2019t quite ready to stop just yet.\n\nShe has three more Paralympic golds to gather if she is to surpass the overall record of 16 set by Mike Kenny, but such is the remarkable nature of Storey\u2019s achievements that few would now put it past her to create further history yet.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nAs she prepares to compete at this week\u2019s UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships in Emmen, her desire to add to her unparalleled success is as strong as ever \u2013 Storey has certainly never doubted herself.\n\n\u201cTokyo has always been the main focus since I came back to racing after having [son] Charlie in 2017,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to be selected for both road and track at the 2020 Games. The plan is to try and defend the three titles I won in Rio \u2013 individual pursuit, time trial and road race.\n\n\u201cI came back from having Charlie a little bit slower than I did from having [daughter] Louisa with it being my second child, but I made sure I didn\u2019t give myself any unrealistic targets.\n\n\u201cIt was always about consolidating my fitness to get back on track towards Tokyo, and I wanted to get fit at my own pace.\u201d\n\nEarly starts, long hours and countless rehearsals make training for a Paralympic Games gruelling enough \u2013 add recovering from pregnancy into the mix and it becomes a whole lot tougher.\n\nReturning to world-class fitness after having a baby takes some doing, but in the world of women\u2019s cycling, it is slowly becoming the norm.\n\nStorey won Paralympic gold in Rio less than three years after having her first child and secured two titles at the UCI 2018 Para-cycling Road World Championships just ten months after giving birth to her second.\n\nIf selected, Tokyo will be Storey\u2019s first Paralympics as a mother-of-two.\n\nAnd while Storey wants her achievements to be a source of inspiration for other women on the saddle, she insists making a comeback from pregnancy is far from a cycling phenomenon.\n\n\u201cI think coming back after having children is possible in any sport, not just cycling,\u201d Storey said.\n\n\u201cPeople go back to work after having children in all sorts of different physically demanding jobs, so why not sport? You just have to perfect that balancing act.\u201d\n\nThe likes of Laura Kenny and Lizzie Deignan have joined the pantheon of sporting super-mums in recent years, proving it is possible to juggle motherhood with a comeback to elite level cycling.\n\n\u201cIt just so happens that at the moment in cycling there\u2019s both Laura and I who are at the top of our sport after becoming mothers, but Liz McColgan did it, so did Sally Gunnell, Denise Lewis and so many other athletes.\n\n\u201cHelen Jenkins still has the desire to compete again after having two children \u2013 it\u2019s definitely possible, it just depends on you as an athlete and how you prefer to complete your career.\n\n\u201cSome people may save having children until the later part of their career, so there is no pressure or definite need to come back, but others may not see it that way.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just all about the support you have around you and whether or not you are able to travel with your children. The health of your children is the most important thing and I\u2019ve been very lucky to have two very healthy children, who can share my adventures with me.\u201d\n\nRecovering from pregnancy is the first task, but continuing to train alongside the demands of parenthood is quite the challenge when you\u2019re trying to figure out how to win your next Paralympic gold.\n\nThere are plenty of ups and downs, but for Storey, having her children witness her achievements is a beneficial experience for all.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for any parent who is working, especially on the road, is making sure you have time to see your children \u2013 if I didn\u2019t take them with me, they\u2019d never see me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing them experience it and have the opportunity to see a different culture.\n\n\u201cWe were training in Spain recently and it was amazing to hear Charlie speak his first Spanish word \u2013 \u2018Gracias!\u2019 He\u2019s not two until October, so hearing him pick up those little bits of knowledge is amazing.\n\n\u201cThese experiences give them so much as growing individuals \u2013 you can\u2019t put a price on what it gives them development-wise. It\u2019s definitely a job that is beneficial to both myself and my little ones.\u201d\n\nParenthood is not the only challenge Storey has had to face. Having switched from swimming to the saddle in 2005, Storey is certainly no stranger to the issues that face professional women\u2019s cycling.\n\nA trailblazer in women\u2019s and para sport, Storey wanted to do something about it. So, amidst her hectic schedule, she set up her own racing academy to help ease the process for Britain\u2019s next set of road race champions.\n\n\u201cOriginally, we decided to launch the team with the support of crowdfunding to continue to give me a platform to race, but the added bonus from my perspective is being able to support young women who are at different stages in their cycling careers,\u201d Storey said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real mix of athletes, from the Backstedt sisters taking on the world to junior riders who are hoping to be selected for the Yorkshire World Championships. For us, it\u2019s all about supporting younger athletes and helping them find UCI contracts \u2013 Grace Garner came through our team in 2016 and also Lizzy Banks, who recently won a stage of the Giro [Rosa]. These riders have utilised our team as a stepping stone to move up in the sport. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do \u2013 give them that essential experience to help them further their own careers.\n\n\u201cWe started working with Skoda this year, too, to further enhance the opportunities for riders at a lower level. We want to give them that all-round experience of being a modern athlete and set something up that would allow us to close the gender gap in cycling in the UK.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s launched her own team, won countless medals and wants to use her own experiences to inspire other women \u2013 Storey has done all she can to eliminate inequalities from sport. Now she\u2019s calling for more recognition from elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI face the same problems as a woman and as a para-athlete,\u201d she said. \u201cToo often you see articles about women\u2019s bodies or their lifestyle, rather than their athletic achievements.\n\n\u201cIf you read articles about para-athletes, the first thing people talk about is their disability. It\u2019s not right that we put those ahead of their athletic achievements.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. We need more coverage to harness the development of para sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be known, people must be able to see what is happening, so people who are interested can enter the right pathway, whether they\u2019re male or female, able-bodied or a para-athlete.\u201d", "description": "Barcelona 1992.
