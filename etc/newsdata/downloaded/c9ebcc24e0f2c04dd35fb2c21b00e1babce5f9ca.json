Other commentators said the language of \"pathways\" was lukewarm at best, and didn't suggest the talks had turned a corner.\n\nThe two main sticking points concern the 500km border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is why Mr Varadkar's role is key.\n\nIreland wants to avoid any kind of trade-impeding border - particularly one that would require putting customs inspection infrastructure on the frontier, creating a potential target of renewed sectarian violence.\n\nBut that would mean keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's customs union and single market - and in effect drawing the border between Northern Ireland and the British mainland instead.\n\nMr Johnson relies on the support of the 10 MPs from Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which vehemently opposes any plan that would delineate the province from the rest of Britain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe impasse has bedevilled the talks for years, and Mr Johnson's deal tried to get around it with two borders: a customs border on the island of Ireland, but without physical checks); and a regulatory (single market) border in the Irish Sea.\n\nIreland has been unconvinced about the customs plan, and also about Mr Johnson's proposal to allow Northern Ireland leaders a periodic veto on the regulatory plan.\n\nNo details were released on Thursday as to what pathway Mr Johnson and Mr Varadkar see for getting out of this, and there was no indication on whether it can be ironed out before a crunch EU leaders' summit next Thursday and Friday.\n\nAre Irish eyes smiling? Ireland's PM Leo Varadkar with British PM Boris Johnson. Getty\n\nMr Johnson wants to leave on October 31 with no Brexit deal at all if he can't get his latest proposed plan through the EU and his parliament. But MPs have passed a law preventing this.\n\nSo if he can't get a deal in the coming days, he'll probably have to ask the EU for a three-month delay to Brexit. He then wants to fight an election as the only party promising to deliver Brexit by January 31 - with or without a deal - and blaming the other parties for failing to leave on October 31.\n\nOpposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Thursday he's ready to fight that election, although some in his Labour Party would rather see Brexit resolved, possibly through a second referendum, before going to the polls.", "description": "Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar identify a \"pathway\" to a deal - but it sounds like there's still a long way to go in a very short time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6565%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1112%2C$y_369/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/99569600c80d2a02e8360a64a88b41aa6472f0fd", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
