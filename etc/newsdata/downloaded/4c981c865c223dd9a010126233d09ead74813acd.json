With some Democrat candidates proposing elimination of private health insurance in favor of a government-run health plan and increased scrutiny of healthcare costs, UnitedHealth stock had fallen about 11% this year.\n\nBMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said the stock may have risen as much as it did because the report eased concerns about the potential for elevated medical costs and 2020 earnings. \"There's been this massive relief this morning,\" he said.\n\nFor the quarter, the company's medical care ratio, or the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services, was 82.4%, worsening from 81% last year but in line with the average analyst estimate.\n\nRevenue from the health insurance business rose 4.7% to $48.11 billion in the third quarter, while Optum posted a 13.3% jump to $28.76 billion.\n\nExcluding items, UnitedHealth earned $3.88 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 13 cents, bolstered by higher Optum revenue as well as its core health insurance business.\n\nTotal revenue rose 6.7% to $60.35 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $59.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nUnitedHealth shares were up nearly 8% at $238.00 after climbing as high as $239.84 earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr and Bill Berkrot)", "description": "The largest U.S. health insurer, which also raised its 2019 earnings forecast for the third time this year, is targeting earnings growth of between 13% and 16% in the long term.
