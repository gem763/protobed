The bill also allows judges to issue search warrants at the same time as they grant the orders. The warrants can be used immediately if the gun owners are served with the relinquishment orders but fail to turn over the firearms or ammunition.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has outperformed the rest of the nation, because of our gun safety laws, in reducing the gun murder rate substantially compared to the national reduction,\u201d Newsom said as he signed the measures surrounded by state lawmakers. \u201cNo state does it as well or comprehensively as the state of California, and we still have a long way to go.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Fox News", "Foxnews.Com Politics California-Expands-Gun-Seizure-Law"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
