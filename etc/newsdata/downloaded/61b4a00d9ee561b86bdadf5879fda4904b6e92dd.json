A previous plan showed China would send 10 BDS satellites into space this year.\n\nTo meet the tight launch schedule, satellite developer China Academy of Space Technology said it streamlined the development process of BDS satellites, halving the development cycle of a single satellite model to 18 months.\n\nOn Sept 23, two new medium earth orbit satellites equipped with lightweight hydrogen maser clocks were launched into space, which will make the satellite navigation system work more accurately.\n\nThe system has been applied in many industries, including transport, maritime affairs, electricity, civil affairs, meteorology, fisheries, surveying and mapping, mining and public security.\n\nChina has established BDS cooperation mechanisms with countries and organizations, strengthening technical exchanges and personnel training, and building BDS overseas centers.", "description": "China will possibly launch all BeiDou-3 satellites to complete the global network of its BeiDou Navigation Satellite System into space by the end of June, about half a year ahead of schedule, according to a top system official.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/22/5dae6f68a310cf3e97a263b4.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
