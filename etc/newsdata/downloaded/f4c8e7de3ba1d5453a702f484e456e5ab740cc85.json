It could also put more strain on Trump's already-tense relationship with the US intelligence community.\n\nThe Post reported that Trump interacted with at least five foreign leaders in the five weeks before the whistleblower filed their complaint: Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar.\n\nPutin is the only one Trump is known to have spoken on the phone with, a call Trump initiated.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee is fighting with the Trump administration to obtain the full complaint\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, first revealed the existence of the complaint last week, when he subpoenaed the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, to turn over the full complaint to the committee in accordance with federal law.\n\nThe IC IG determined that the complaint was credible and a matter of \"urgent concern.\" But the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) overruled the IC IG after consulting with the Justice Department and concluding that the complaint does not fit the definition of \"urgent concern\" under federal law.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on the phone in the Oval Office.

For that reason, after consulting with the Justice Department, the agency concluded it was not required to forward the complaint to the intelligence committees.\n\nSchiff said on Tuesday that Klitenic's letter added to concerns that the ODNI was acting to shield Trump or someone in his inner circle from public scrutiny.\n\nIn addition to flagging the complaint with the Justice Department \u2014 which is unusual in and of itself for matters like these \u2014 Maguire also refused to comment on whether the White House was involved in the decision to withhold the complaint from the House Intelligence Committee, and whether it related to any matters being investigated by the panel.\n\nSchiff said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that Maguire said he was not turning over the complaint, even though federal law mandates it, \"because he is being instructed not to\" and \"answering to a higher authority\" on the matter.\n\n\"This involved a higher authority, someone above the DNI,\" Schiff said, alluding to Trump. \"Well, there are only a few people above the DNI.\"", "description": "The whistleblower was deeply troubled by a phone call President Donald Trump had with a foreign leader, and a \"promise\" Trump made during the call.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a51082e22af13fb3abb9e-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
