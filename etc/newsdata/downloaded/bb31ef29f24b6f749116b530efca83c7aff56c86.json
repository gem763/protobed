Again, I\u2019m not asking for a parade. I\u2019m not asking for a pardon. I\u2019m not asking for a pass. What I\u2019m asking for is a fair trial.\u201d\n\nSnowden explained to the \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d panel that a jury would consider whether his actions were lawful or unlawful, as opposed to right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but that defeats the purpose of a jury trial,\u201d he said.\n\nThe infamous whistleblower said that he didn\u2019t want to reside in Russia but was trapped there when the United States canceled his passport while traveling to Latin America.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to continue on my journey into asylum,\u201d he said.\n\nGayle King pointed out that the \u201coptics are not good\u201d that he\u2019s in Russia, to which Snowden agreed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right and I\u2019m on the same side,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s problematic and of course I would like to return to the United States.\u201d\n\nThe ex-National Security Agency contractor blew the lid off U.S. government surveillance methods in 2013. Moscow has resisted U.S. pressure to extradite Snowden, who faces U.S. charges that could land him in prison for up to 30 years.\n\nThe Guardian in Britain published the first story based on Snowden's disclosures. It revealed that a secret court order was allowing the U.S. government to get Verizon to share the phone records of millions of Americans. Later stories, including those in The Washington Post, disclosed other snooping and how U.S. and British spy agencies had accessed information from cables carrying the world's telephone and internet traffic.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Edward Snowden \u2013 who is now living in exile in Russia -- said Monday he would like to return to the United States but only if he can receive a fair trial by jury.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
