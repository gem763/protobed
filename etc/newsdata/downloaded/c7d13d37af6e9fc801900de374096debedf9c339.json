On the same day Jolie King and Mark Firkin were set free, an extradition request for an Iranian student to be sent from Brisbane to the United States was denied. Instead, Dehbashi Kivi will be sent back to Iran. Attorney-General Christian Porter has refused to confirm the details but released a statement about the case. Mr Porter says, \"While it is likely that because of Mr Kivi's nationality some will speculate regarding this matter... consistent with prior practice, I do not intend to comment further on the particular details of this case.\" \"Particularly when any such response from me may diminish our Government's capacity to deal with future matters of this type in Australia's best interests,\" he said.
