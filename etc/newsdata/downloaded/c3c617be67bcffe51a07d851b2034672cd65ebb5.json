The current price of NVDA \u2014 $167 \u2014 suggests a market capitalization just over $100 billion. Nvidia has agreed to pay just under $7 billion for Mellanox.\n\nWhat the Suddenly Shaky Mellanox Deal Means for Nvidia Stock More\n\nSource: Hairem / Shutterstock.com\n\nThat said, the acquisition might be more important than the numbers suggest. And it\u2019s possible uncertainty surrounding its approval is part of the reason why NVDA stock continues to trade sideways.\n\nAfter all, the Mellanox deal touches on key aspects of the case for \u2014 and against \u2014 Nvidia stock at the moment. Meanwhile, with MLNX stock near a post-acquisition low, the market clearly is pricing in a shrinking chance of approval.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question for Mellanox stock is whether the potential upside is worth the risk of the deal breaking. The question for Nvidia stock is whether a broken deal at this point would raise more concern \u2014 or could potentially be even good news.\n\nWhere the Deal Stands Now\n\nBack in March, Nvidia won a bidding war for Mellanox. Reports leading up to the announcement suggested that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) all were interested in the Israeli networking provider.\n\nIt was Nvidia that was willing to pay the highest price \u2014 and perhaps with good reason. The addition of Mellanox\u2019s interconnect portfolio (adapters and switches) gives Nvidia an edge in its datacenter business. The acquisition, as CEO Jensen Huang put it, allowed Nvidia to \u201cdouble down\u201d in that key end market.\n\nAt the time that the acquisition was announced, approval seemed assured. The \u201cdeal spread\u201d \u2014 the return on MLNX stock assuming the deal closed at the $125 per share acquisition price \u2014 initially was just 6%. That narrowed at one point to as little as 3.4%.\n\nIt\u2019s now near 17%, however \u2014 almost at its widest point ever. Trade war concerns are the primary factor. China blocked the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) last year. It may see the Nvidia-Mellanox deal as another way to score trade war points.\n\nMLNX traded around $90 at the beginning of this year before falling amid chip sector concerns and then rising amid takeover speculation. The current price of $107 thus probably suggests the market sees a roughly 50-60% chance of approval at this point, assuming the stock would head back to the $90 level if Nvidia walked away. Again, the interesting question is what that means for NVDA stock at the moment.\n\nDoes Nvidia Stock Take a Hit From Losing Out on Mellanox?\n\nThe simplest thesis is that NVDA stock takes a hit if the Mellanox deal falls through. For one, Nvidia, according to its 10-Q, would owe Mellanox a $350 million termination fee.\n\nBut that fee is relatively insignificant: about 0.34% of the current Nvidia market capitalization. It\u2019s the impact to the NVDA \u201cstory\u201d that looks much more important.\n\nAfter all, the two big risks to Nvidia stock right now seem to be in datacenter and in sector/macro sentiment. Datacenter demand has slowed notably across the industry so far this year. Nvidia management continues to see a second-half rebound, but clearly investors aren\u2019t convinced.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S.-China trade battle has been a negative for chip stocks across the board. Stocks in the sector, including NVDA, INTC and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), have been repeatedly rattled by tariff concerns. And the macro concerns amplify the category-specific worries in datacenter: a global recession likely means Nvidia over promises in the second half of FY20, just as it did a year ago with the \u201ccrypto bubble\u201c.\n\nOn top of those two risks, a broken deal means management worries start getting a little louder. Nvidia whiffed on crypto last year. It could whiff on datacenter this year. Management insisted on the Q2 conference call last month that the deal would close by the end of the year. If it\u2019s wrong again, three big forecasting misses in roughly a year will erode the credibility of Huang and CFO Colette Kress.", "description": "To be sure, the acquisition by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) of Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ:MLNX) isn't a transformative deal for Nvidia stock.
