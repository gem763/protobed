Courtesy One Medical\n\nBig bets on companies changing the way we got to the doctor\n\nThis week (not that it's all that different any other week), one topic has consumed most of my waking thoughts and conversations: Primary Care.\n\nMost notably, as CNBC reported Tuesday, One Medical is reportedly gearing up for an IPO. The 12-year-old company has raised $408 million and has a private valuation of $1.5 billion for its primary care service that charges a $200 annual fee and uses your insurance.\n\nIt got me thinking about about the precedent of a publicly traded primary care company. Most of the time, it seems like medical practices are relegated to the private equity space.\n\nThe news that One Medical has hired bankers wasn't the only vote of confidence for investors taking a more serious look at at companies looking to change the way we go to the doctor. On Wednesday, Andreessen Horowitz promoted Julie Yoo to general partner at the firm's biofund. She'll be investing in companies that are using software to transform healthcare. Here are the top 3 areas she plans to invest in.\n\nThen, on Thursday, Parsley Health, a doctor's office that charges $150 a month and doesn't take insurance, raised $26 million to take its model national.\n\nThe news this week gave me a lot of chances to update this always evergreen post of the big players in the primary care space. It's shaping up to be an even more interesting time for primary care startups.\n\nWith so much funding pouring in, will we see more from the list prep for an IPO? Any gossip? Tips? Speculation? I'm all ears at lramsey@businessinsider.com.\n\nClarrie Feinstein spent a day with one of the vans in Manhattan's East Village to see how people without insurance get care in the wealthiest city in the world.", "description": "Welcome to Dispensed, our weekly dispatch of healthcare, biotech, and pharma news from Business Insider.", "authors": ["Lydia Ramsey"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c2f7f05bd77305daf6487b5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
