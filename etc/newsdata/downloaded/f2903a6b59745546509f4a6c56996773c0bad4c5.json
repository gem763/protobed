The firm charged the parody \u201cdraws a parallel between Hitler and his officers, on the one hand, and [the refinery manager] on the other.\u201d Australia\u2019s Fair Work Commission agreed. And so the law \u2014 or at least Australian labor law \u2014 has officially deemed Downfall parody videos to be accusations of Nazism.\n\nIf you are too young, or perhaps too old, to recall Downfall parodies, it is a genre that uses a scene from the 2004 German-language Hitler movie, but replacing subtitles of the Fuhrer\u2019s monologue for a rant about a contemporary subject, which could be politics, sports, or culture. They began not long after the film came out, were already being covered in the New York Times by 2008, and had grown pass\u00e9 by Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nThe culture has long since moved on from Downfall (with a handful of isolated exceptions, such as the people living on oil rigs off the Australian coast). The internet has cycled through several generations of memes in the intervening years, from a dog calmly sipping coffee in a burning house to biker dudes shouting at each other. Given the speed of online discourse, Downfall parodies today feel as antiquated as the events of the film.\n\nAnd yet now we find ourselves living in en era when the Downfall scene is eerily on point. To be perfectly clear, Donald Trump is not Hitler. His many crimes are not going to rise anywhere close to the level of genocide or global war. But Trump is distinctly less not-Hitler than other presidents.\n\nAnd not only is the president an erratic, compulsively dishonest demagogic nationalist with an instinctive loathing for democracy, he is also prone to the sort of behavior depicted in the famous Downfall scene where Hitler berates his aides for a predicament Hitler himself has created. Episodes like this now appear in the news every week.\n\nCoda to this \u2066@sbg1\u2069 piece - what the president has been doing a lot of this summer within the White House and at Bedminster is yelling at his aides,\n\nflashing temper more than he has in months, according to multiple current and former officials. https://t.co/yPR5P2ruxf \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) September 4, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s entire presidency is lurching from one hyperaggressive plan to the next, angrily insisting his unique genius has saved the country, while railing at the enemies who surround him. You can even watch versions of the bunker scene play out in real time on Twitter, as Trump calls his hand-picked Federal Reserve chair an \u201cenemy,\u201d his former secretary of State \u201cdumb as a rock,\u201d his former communications director a \u201cdope,\u201d his former attorney a \u201cbad lawyer and fraudster,\u201d and so on. And every account of the White House staff is basically the Germans standing outside Hitler\u2019s office grim and stone-faced while they listen to his tirade.\n\nYet Downfall parodies have all but disappeared even as they are a far closer approximation of reality than anybody could have imagined possible when they were in vogue. It is as if people stopped using the distracted-boyfriend meme and then Bill Clinton became president, or we somehow elected a coffee-sipping dog who calmly sat through a White House fire, and the internet\u2019s response was to write parodies of \u201cThis Is Just to Say.\u201d (I have sipped/the coffee/that was in/my dog bowl/instead/of doing something/about/the huge fire.)\n\nPerhaps the internet is incapable of reviving a meme once it has moved past. Or maybe the Downfall meme has become unusable because it is uncomfortably close to reality: Likening somebody to Hitler is a good joke until it\u2019s possible you\u2019re not joking any more.", "description": "Parodies of \u201cdownfall,\u201d the 2004 film about Hitler\u2019s final days, have gone out of favor. But it\u2019s an internet meme that almost eerily captures the real world dynamic of Donald Trump, the erratic demagogue who often berates his staff.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chait"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/05/trump-downfall.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
