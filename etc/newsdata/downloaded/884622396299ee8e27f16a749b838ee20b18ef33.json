Minor delays are still reported on the lines.\n\nFour protesters have been arrested, British Transport Police (BTP) said.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said the disruption was \"necessary to highlight the emergency\".\n\nImage copyright Extinction Rebellion Image caption Protesters climbed to the top of a train carriage at Shadwell station\n\nIn the footage shared on social media from Canning Town station, a passenger waiting for a train is seen climbing on the carriage to get to one of the protesters.\n\nThe activist is grabbed by the knees and dragged down, falling to the platform where he appears to then be kicked and hit by angry commuters on the platform.\n\nOthers can be heard shouting and swearing at the protesters.\n\nOne shouts: \"I have to get to work too - I have to feed my kids.\"\n\nImage copyright @CharWilkoo Image caption Extinction Rebellion protesters climb on to a Jubilee line at Canning Town station\n\nA second protester was chased along the top of the train carriage by a commuter before being dragged off.\n\nA third Extinction Rebellion activist, who was broadcasting the protest on the group's social media accounts, said he was also attacked and \"kicked in the head\".\n\nIn a statement BTP said: \"We continue to urge protesters to not target the London Underground network. This is dangerous, not only for protesters but for commuters.\n\n\"We have increased our patrols on the London Underground and at other rail hubs throughout London.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent\n\nEven from within Extinction Rebellion there has been disagreement on targeting public transport - particularly London's Tube and DLR which are pretty efficient, very well-used and low carbon.\n\nMany think public transport is part of the solution to achieving net zero-carbon transport systems.\n\nBy targeting the transport network, protesters are confusing their messages.\n\nHowever, you have to remember Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised umbrella term for lots and lots of smaller groups and as such they have differing methods - some more radical than others - and can operate independently.\n\nAnd - ultimately - what they want is publicity for the cause.\n\nExtinction Rebellion co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube action, saying \"the public, I don't think, realise quite how serious this situation is\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC she added: \"Someone has been hurt today. We understand that putting ourselves in these positions is potentially dangerous for us.\n\n\"But what else can we do?\"\n\nAt Shadwell station several activists glued themselves to trains, including 83-year-old Phil Kingston,\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said in a statement: \"I strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning.\n\n\"This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work.\"\n\nImage copyright Extinction Rebellion Image caption At Shadwell station, one of the protesters who had glued themselves to trains was 83-year-old Phil Kingston\n\nTrain drivers' union Aslef said the Tube and other public transport services were \"part of the solution to climate change, not the problem\".\n\nExtinction Rebellion should \"stick to protesting against those who create the problem - not our industry, members and hard-working commuters\", the union added.\n\nA public order ban has been put in place on Extinction Rebellion activities in London since Monday.\n\nIn response, Extinction Rebellion called on \"all London rebels and friends\" to defy the ban.\n\nWere you at one of the affected stations?
