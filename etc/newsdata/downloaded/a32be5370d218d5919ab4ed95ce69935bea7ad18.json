Previous versions have also been connected to wires, he said, or have been limited to creating movement in just one limb.\n\nWatch the exoskeleton at work:\n\nThe man is now able to walk using an exoskeleton that relies on commands by signals from his brain. 0:50\n\nIn this trial, two recording devices were implanted, one either side of the patient's head between the brain and the skin, spanning the sensorimotor cortex region of the brain that controls sensation and motor function.\n\nEach recorder contained 64 electrodes which collected brain signals and transmitted them to a decoding algorithm. The system translated the brain signals into the movements the patient thought about, and sent his commands to the exoskeleton.\n\nOver 24 months, the patient carried out various mental tasks to train the algorithm to understand his thoughts and to progressively increase the number of movements he could make.\n\nCommenting on the results, Tom Shakespeare, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it was \"a welcome and exciting advance\" but added: \"Proof of concept is a long way from usable clinical possibility.\"\n\n\"A danger of hype always exists in this field. Even if ever workable, cost constraints mean that high-tech options are never going to be available to most people in the world with spinal cord injury.\"", "description": "A man paralyzed from the shoulders down has been able to walk using a pioneering four-limb robotic system, or exoskeleton, that is commanded and controlled by signals from his brain.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5308745.1570195078!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/exoskelton-walking.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
