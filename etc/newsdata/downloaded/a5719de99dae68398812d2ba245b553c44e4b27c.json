For former police officer, Amber Guyger, who had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for killing an innocent man, it was also a foretaste of the Last Judgment.\n\nBotham Jean had been minding his own business, when a distracted off-duty police officer was returning home to her apartment in the same building as his. Mistakenly she entered the 28-year old man\u2019s apartment thinking it was her own, and discovered who she thought was an intruder. She drew her firearm and killed him in his own home.\n\nAt the sentencing, Botham\u2019s 18-year old brother, Brandt, gave victim impact testimony, since victims have the right to be heard in the presence of the accused regarding the impact of their offence. There is the judgment of law first, but then there is also the very personal judgment that victims may justly render, and that courts ensure are heard by the accused.\n\nA soft-spoken, bespeckled young articulate man, dressed in a shawl-collared black suit coat, blue shirt, and a pink tie took the witness stand to be heard. He began, haltingly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say twice or for the hundredth time how much you\u2019ve taken from us. I think you know that.\u201d Brandt Jean looked like a man who was ready to give a sentence.\n\n\u201cI hope you go to God with all that guilt,\u201d he proceeded. \u201cIf you truly are sorry\u2026I forgive you.\u201d He pushed quickly past his own forgiveness, and back to God. \u201cI know if you go to God and ask Him, He will forgive you.\u201d\n\nOne can imagine a victim telling the accused to beg for God\u2019s mercy, as if it was unlikely to come. Yet Brandt wanted Amber to know that God would forgive her if she was truly sorry. He wanted her to know that though she took the life of his beloved big brother, that he also loved her. \u201cI love you just like anyone else\u2026I personally want the best for you\u2026I don\u2019t even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you, because I know that\u2019s exactly what Botham would want\u2026And the best would be to give your life to Christ. Giving your life to Christ is the best thing Botham would want you to do. Again, I love you as a person, and I don\u2019t wish anything bad on you.\u201d Turning to the Judge, Brandt almost begged, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is possible, but can I give her a hug please? Please?\u201d The Judge conceded to the request, and Amber wept in Brandt\u2019s arms.\n\nIt must be said that Brandt would surely have preferred the embrace of his deceased brother. This would have been greater in all the most obvious ways. And yet in another sense, Brandt must know that there is, in this embrace, a greater love \u2014 a love which finds its reason in God alone.\n\nIn Deus Caritas Est, Benedict XVI writes: \u201cLove of neighbour\u2026consists in the very fact that, in God and with God, I love even the person whom I do not like or even know. This can only take place on the basis of an intimate encounter with God, an encounter which has become a communion of will, even affecting my feelings. Then I learn to look on this other person not simply with my eyes and my feelings, but from the perspective of Jesus Christ. His friend is my friend.\u201d\n\nBrandt looked upon Amber as someone loved by God. Not everyone sees this way, nor can we expect or demand that everyone see this way. Nietzscheans will find it to be nothing but slave morality and weakness. Yet many did see something in that Dallas courtroom. We saw an intimate and personal love that wasn\u2019t sexual, or self-serving, or demanding, or needy. The world saw someone will the good of another, purely, and truly. In the midst of so much darkness, the world saw a great light \u2014 we saw charity in a Dallas courtroom, and in seeing charity, we see God. Not directly but indirectly we see that the love of God and neighbor are one \u2014 we can glimpse, through a single extraordinary act of charity, the One who is Love Itself.", "description": "The world saw God in a Dallas Courtroom on Wednesday afternoon.
