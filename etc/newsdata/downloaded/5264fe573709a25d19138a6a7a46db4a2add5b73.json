Instead, maybe performers can follow in Kim Petras\u2019s cloven platform footsteps and release a Halloween album in their own unique style. Just as soon as the calendar clicked over to October 1 tonight, the \u201cHeart to Break\u201d singer released Turn Off the Light, a full Halloween album featuring songs with very promising names like \u201cBloody Valentine\u201d and \u201cDeath by Sex.\u201d\n\nWhile the album technically has 17 tracks, eight of them are songs from the Halloween EP Petras released last year, which was entitled Turn Off the Light, Vol. 1.
