REUTERS/Johanna Geron\n\nThe EU agreed earlier on Friday to London\u2019s request for a Brexit deadline extension but set no new departure date, giving Britain\u2019s divided parliament time to decide on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s call for a snap election.\n\n\u201cFrance wants a justified and proportionate extension. However, we have nothing of the sort so far,\u201d the source told Reuters. \u201cWe must show the British that it is up to them to clarify the situation and that an extension is not a given.\u201d\n\nOne EU diplomat said France favoured a delay until Nov. 15 or Nov. 30 to keep pressure on the British parliament to approve the departure deal Johnson negotiated with the EU or face a disorderly Brexit.\n\nThe source close to Macron declined to say for how long Macron would agree to extend. French officials have previously suggested that the holding of an election or referendum could provide a political justification for an extension.\n\nMacron believes time pressure is important to ensure the ratification process by Britain\u2019s parliament can be completed, with or without an election.\n\n\u201cPressure must be maintained,\u201d the source added.\n\nAny extension must serve a clear purpose, such as ratifying the current deal, or holding a new election, French officials said. It is up to Britain to explain how much time it needs in each scenario, a second French official said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not being firm for the sake of being firm. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve seen that simply giving time to time leads to nowhere,\u201d the official told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt is up to the British to tell us how much time they need to pass a bill. You don\u2019t need 110 years to pass a bill, surely,\u201d the official said, adding that if parliament simply needed time for ratification, then 10 or 15 extra days should suffice.\n\nMore time could be granted if parliament supported Johnson\u2019s call for a new election, the official added.\n\n\u201cWe want to respect British sovereignty. If it must be expressed by elections, we would understand that. But what we need is clarity,\u201d the official said.\n\nAsked what France made of other EU countries\u2019 preference for a long-term extension to Jan. 31, the official said: \u201cThis period of uncertainty is toxic. What is the point of just giving time to time?\u201d", "description": "Brexit negotiations should only be extended beyond Oct. 31 for as long as Britain can justify to the European Union's 27 remaining members, a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday.", "authors": ["Michel Rose", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444879832&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O15L", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
