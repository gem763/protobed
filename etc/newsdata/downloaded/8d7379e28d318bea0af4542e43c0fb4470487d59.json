The Fed\u2019s balance sheet, Parker notes, jumped from $3.77 trillion last month to $3.97 trillion. It had previously been higher, while the Fed\u2019s own projections call for a balance sheet worth $4.7 trillion by 2025.\n\nWorld \u201csleepwalking\u201d into the next financial crisis\n\nFor holders of assets that cannot have their supply inflated, such as gold and Bitcoin, money printing has regularly sparked calls to decrease reliance on fiat currency.\n\nParker\u2019s suggestion that investors should buy BTC now came amid warnings from even the fiat establishment itself about the ailing health of the banking system.\n\nIn a speech at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s general meeting last week, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King told attendees the world was \u201csleepwalking\u201d into a financial crisis even worse than that of 2008.\n\n\u201cBy sticking to the new orthodoxy of monetary policy and pretending that we have made the banking system safe, we are sleepwalking towards that crisis,\u201d he summarized.\n\nThe concept that interventionist economic practices on the part of governments and central banks leads to financial destruction forms one of the central tenets of Saifedean Ammous\u2019 \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard.\u201d\n\nReleased in March 2018, the book focuses on Bitcoin as it compares to fiat currency and commodities such as gold.\n\nAs Cointelegraph noted, at ten years old, Bitcoin has now lasted 40% of the average fiat currency\u2019s lifespan.", "description": "Fed\u2019s balance sheet expands to $3.97 trillion in weeks as ex-Bank of England governor predicts a looming financial crisis", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMTRjOTBhNWQ5M2UyY2U0ODg1ZGI1YmFmNWE5MTc4YTkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
