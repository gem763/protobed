But for how long?\n\nBack when Paul was just 14, Kel would return home from the pub and sexually abuse the teenager. Naturally, Paul was horrified to see the ghost of his past walk back into his life.\n\nJoe Alessi, who by his own admission has the misfortune of playing a creep of the Cobbles, appeared on Lorraine today to confirm his time on the soap will come to an end. He just doesn\u2019t know when.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have no idea [how long I have left], it is open-ended,\u2019 he told the host.\n\n\u2018The character I\u2019m playing is finite, I\u2019ll never be a regular on Corrie that\u2019s sure.\u2019\n\n\u2018My role will come to an end,\u2019 he confirmed, but not before there \u2018will be a lot of fall out\u2019.\n\nPaul is reliving his childhood hell in Coronation Street (Picture: ITV)\n\nJoe insisted Kel comes as a warning to viewers. \u2018A lot of these people seem to be normal people; they\u2019re not monsters \u2013 they\u2019re not the child catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,\u2019 he said.\n\nPaul put Kel in hospital this week, after trying to kiss his groomer and claiming Kel was only interested when he was \u2019young\u2019. But Kel is back under Paul\u2019s skin. \u2018They think I\u2019m the victim here; not you,\u2019 Kel sniggered.\n\nPaul has turned to Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank), but can the vicar help bring Kel down?\n\nCoronation Street continues tonight at 7.30pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
