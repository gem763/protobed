For Schumer, it\u2019s \u201cone of the most disturbing things we\u2019ve learned yet.\u201d\n\nSounding the alarm in a Twitter thread, Schumer called it \u201cextremely harmful to both our national security and the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House should immediately provide the Congressional intelligence committees with all the records of that meeting so we can get to the bottom of it,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most disturbing things we\u2019ve learned yet.\n\n\n\nThe White House should immediately provide the Congressional intelligence committees with all the records of that meeting so we can get to the bottom of it. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) September 28, 2019\n\nOn Friday night, The Washington Post published published yet another bombshell in what was already a chaotic week for the White House, citing three former officials who said the president made the remarks during a 2017 Oval Office meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n\nDuring their discussion, Trump purportedly said he was not concerned about Moscow\u2019s meddling in the United States\u2019 2016 presidential election because the U.S. has done the same abroad.\n\nAccording to the Post\u2019s sources, the assertion \u201cprompted alarmed White House officials to limit access to the remarks to an unusually small number of people.\u201d\n\nNow, Schumer is urging Congress to act, demanding that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stop blocking election security bills in the chamber.\n\nIn July, McConnell opposed a House-passed measure to strengthen state election systems with $775 million and a paper ballot requirement. Less than two weeks ago, he reversed course, backing $250 million in election security funding.\n\nHowever, McConnell has also thwarted a proposal that would have ordered candidates, their staffers and family members to inform federal authorities if approached by foreign governments offering aid. Trump himself did not commit to alerting the FBI in such a situation when pressed on the matter during a June ABC News interview.\n\nShortly after the Post\u2019s latest report appeared, Trump tweeted that it was \u201cJust more Fake News,\u201d pointing to former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster\u2019s past claim that the 2017 conversation was \u201cwholly appropriate.\u201d\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, Trump had not yet spoken out further about the Post\u2019s story, spending the morning tweeting out his campaign slogans and repeating his often used claim of \u201cpresidential harassment.\u201d", "description": "New allegations have surfaced that the president told Russian officials he didn't care about election interference.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8f9d8f2200005a00deef60.jpeg?cache=wdaofewfmk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
