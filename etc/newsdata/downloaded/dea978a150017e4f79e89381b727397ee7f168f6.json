Kurdish groups seized the opportunity to carve out an autonomous statelet in northeastern Syria, buttressing the southern Turkish border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kurdish presence, abutting the Turkish border, enraged the Turkish government, which considers the Kurdish-led militia an enemy because of its ties to a Kurdish guerrilla force inside Turkey.\n\nMilitants fighting on behalf of the Turkish president advance on border areas in northern Syria in the drive against the Kurds.

At least 16 Kurds were reported to have been killed, one monitoring group said.\n\nMembers of the Syrian Democratic Forces were killed in the area of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn in northeastern Syria, along with six attackers of unknown identity, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. US troops had withdrawn from both areas Monday.\n\nAn additional 33 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces were wounded, the monitoring group said.\n\nDays after greenlighting the Turkish operation, Trump condemned it as a \"bad idea\" on Wednesday. He said this week that Turkey, a NATO ally, would face economic punishment if it did anything he considered \"off limits.\"\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Turkey's defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said the aims of the operation were to \"ensure the security of our borders and the safety of our people,\" naming Kurdish militias and Islamic State militants as threats.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "A Turkish offensive - dubbed Peace Spring - against former US Kurd allies has already killed four civilians, including a baby, and wounded more than 70.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2759%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_13/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0558914d9cbade8204af4211107e529e095ce58c", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
