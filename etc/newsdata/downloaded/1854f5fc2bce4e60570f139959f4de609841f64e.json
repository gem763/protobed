(AP) \u2014 Only one person remained missing Wednesday after searchers recovered 33 bodies from the charred underwater wreckage of a dive boat that caught fire off the Southern California coast and sank on Labor Day.\n\nAmong the victims were an engineer for Apple who went on the trip with his wife and daughter to celebrate the teen's 17th birthday, a special effects designer for Disney, a nature photographer, a nurse and a physics teacher from Northern California who was with his 26-year-old daughter.\n\nFive crew members, including the captain, managed to escape the Conception after Monday's pre-dawn fire that engulfed the boat as the victims slept below decks near the island of Santa Cruz during a three-day scuba diving excursion. The vessel eventually sank and overturned, making the recovery of bodies challenging.\n\nThe only crewmember to die was 26-year-old Allie Kurtz, who quit her corporate job at Paramount Pictures to work on dive boats and had recently been promoted to deckhand on the Conception.\n\nShe was sleeping with the other divers below deck when flames moved quickly through the 75-foot (23-meter) vessel, blocking a narrow stairway and an escape hatch leading to the upper decks.\n\nDNA will be needed to identify the victims. Authorities will use the same rapid analysis tool that identified victims of the deadly wildfire that devastated the Northern California town of Paradise last year, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\nApple engineer Steve Salika and his wife, Diana Adamic, went on the trip with their daughter Tia Salika to celebrate the teen's 17th birthday, company senior vice president Deirdre O'Brien told The Mercury News newspaper. Apple colleague, Dan Garcia joined them.\n\nTia was a student at Pacific Collegiate Charter School, a high-performing school serving grades seven to 12 in Santa Cruz. Also with her was a fellow student Berenice Felipe, according to a letter sent to the school community obtained by NBC News.\n\nO'Brien said in a statement that Salika's \"energy and enthusiasm touched so many people across our company \" during his 30-year career there, and that Garcia \"was as passionate about his job at Apple as he was about his love of diving. Both leave many friends behind and will be deeply missed.\"\n\nAdamic volunteered at the Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter, as did Tia and Berenice, Jen Walker, a former humane educator at the animal shelter, told the Los Angeles Times in a statement.\n\nAdamic \"was an ally to all living things \u2014 orphan kittens, wild birds, youth volunteers \u2014 and a champion for the natural world around us,\" Walker said.\n\nAnother diver aboard was visual effects designer Charles McIlvain, who was known for his work on films such as \"Spider-Man\" and \"Green Lantern.\"\n\nHis wife, Jasmine Lord, said in a family statement that he was with their close friend Marybeth Guiney, who was also the couple's neighbor in Santa Monica.\n\nBoth lived their lives to the fullest, according to the statement.\n\n\"His laugh was the greatest and his smile could light up the dark,\" the family said in a statement. \"He embraced life with exceptional joy, openness and humor, and all who knew him felt that warmth.\"\n\nMcIlvain worked as a visual effects designer for Walt Disney Imagineering and a pipeline engineer and technical animation supervisor at Sony Pictures Imageworks. He also worked for Netflix.\n\nAnother passenger was Lisa Fiedler, a 52-year-old hairdresser and photographer from the community of Mill Valley north of San Francisco, her mother, Nancy Fiedler, told San Francisco's ABC affiliate, KGO television.\n\n\"Everybody loved her,\" her mother said.\n\nSusana Rosas of Stockton, California, posted that her three daughters \u2014 Evan, Nicole and Angela Quitasol \u2014 were with their father, Michael Quitasol, and stepmother, Fernisa Sison. Evan Quitasol was a nurse in Stockton, where her father and Sison had worked, and her sister Angela was a Stockton science middle school teacher while Nicole worked at a restaurant in Coronado, near San Diego.\n\n\"Everybody's devastated,\" said Dominic Selga, Sison's ex-husband.\n\nThe fire started shortly after 3 a.m. Monday as the boat sat anchored in Platt's Harbor off Santa Cruz Island, among the rugged, wind-swept isles that form Channel Islands National Park.", "description": "Only one person remained missing Wednesday after searchers recovered 33 bodies from the charred underwater wreckage of a dive boat that caught fire off the Southern California coast and sank on Labor Day.
