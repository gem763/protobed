Ron Hubbard, David Koresh, Lyndon LaRouche and Jim Jones\u2019, writes noted cult expert and Harvard Medical School professor Steven Hassan in his upcoming book The Cult of Trump, published by Free Press.\n\nOnce a member of the dangerously manipulative Sun Myung Moon\u2019s Unification Church in the 70s, Hassan escaped the Moonies and believes that \u2018Trump has gotten where he is today because he has exploited that same cult leader playbook \u2013 with his absolute confidence, grandiosity of \u201cOnly I can fix this\u201d, sowing fear and confusion, lying about the facts and belittling critics\u2019.\n\nFollowing the cult leader profile, Trump commands devotion from his audience at rallies, uses patriotic music to herald his appearance while supporters wearing his hats stand cheering behind him on camera.\n\nHe harangues endlessly about how misunderstood he is by the media that he now labels as \u2018corrupt\u2019 and not just \u2018fake news\u2019, and repeats how great his followers are and how much he loves them.\n\nPresident Trump uses rallies that he ostensibly attends to help other Republicans get elected as charging stations where he can demonize his perceived enemies\n\nOnce a member of the dangerously manipulative Sun Myung Moon\u2019s Unification Church in the 70s, author Hassan escaped the Moonies and believes that \u2018Trump has gotten where he is today because he has exploited that same cult leader playbook\n\nThe author likens Trump to cult leaders like David Koresh who had an absentee mothers and that created \u2018insecure parental attachment\u2019 as well as narcissism\n\nHassan maintains the president sounds like cult leader Jim Jones, who directed a mass suicide and murder of more than 900 followers at Jonestown in Guyana in 1978 In his dying breath, Jones said it was \u2018all the media\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t believe them\u2019\n\nHassan writes that the Trump presidency can be evaluated by studying the psychology of mind manipulation and influence from these past cult leaders so that we don\u2019t ignore the lessons of history \u2013 of Jonestown and other destructive groups --- at our own peril.\n\nIt is fear that defines Trump\u2019s philosophy, his personality and his presidency, according to the author.\n\nOne of his first campaign issues was to build a great Wall along the Mexican border to \u2018insulate, isolate and elevate America\u2019 from the rest of the dangerous world.\n\nThe Cult of Trump is published by Free Press and is available on Amazon October 15\n\nThe concept of the Wall allowed Trump to play on images of murderers and rapists gathering at the southern border -- instilling fear in people\u2019s minds of the danger posed by these presumed unruly and hostile immigrants \u2013 and that included Mexicans and even Muslims -- all part of the vast migrant caravan.\n\nHe pumped up the immigration crisis at the border trying to get funding for the wall and belief in the fear he conjured up.\n\nTrump\u2019s other enemies include globalists, radical left-wing Democrats, socialists, Hollywood actors, and the liberal media.\n\nAccording to him, they all want to destroy America.\n\nTrump has copied dictators and cult leaders throughout history with his fear mongering and playing on existing fears, amplifying those fears and distorting them with competing versions of reality and then using the tag line, \u2018Trust me\u2019, or \u2018Believe me\u2019.\n\nHe now sounds like cult leader, Jim Jones, who directed a mass suicide and murder of more than 900 followers at Jonestown in Guyana in 1978. In his dying breath, Jones said it was \u2018all the media\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t believe them\u2019.\n\nTrump is a master media manipulator who never played by traditional political rules.\n\nHe called media outlets to insult his opponents, brag and lie about his own accomplishments while getting billions of dollars worth of free publicity because of the outrageous things he was willing to say.\n\nCult leader and presidential hopeful Lyndon LaRouche gestures at a news conference saying the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court and the Senate Chairman, Senator Joseph Biden were both, 'two evils'\n\nThe 11 cult leader tactics Trump uses 1. Absolute confidence Cult leaders come across as self-assured and all-knowing, leading their followers to have confidence in them too. 2. 'Only I can fix this' grandiosity Trump follows the pattern by teasing secret information or playing up the problems his supporters have, then uses the tag line, \u2018Trust me\u2019, or \u2018Believe me\u2019 to instill faith in him. 3. Sowing fear and confusion Trump has copied dictators and cult leaders throughout history with his fear mongering and playing on existing fears, amplifying those fears and distorting them. 4. Lying about the facts Lies are standard operating procedure and by 2017, Trump had told 2000 lies but that number climbed to 10,000 two years later. Again, lies are \u2018right out of the Cult Leader Playbook\u2019, writes Hassan, and are used to stoke fear and hold onto power \u2013 just a business strategy to keep people watching. 5. Belittling critics Trump is known for coming up with insulting nicknames for his opponents such as Crooked Hillary and Pocahontas for Elizabeth Warren. 6. Commanding devotion Trump uses the same arsenal of indoctrination techniques to grab attention and devotion \u2013 \u2018shunning, shaming, expulsion and physical punishment\u2019. His supporters wear his gear, copy his phrases and are vocal about their admiration. 7. Claiming he's misunderstood Trump rails against the media for not understanding him. Jim Jones, who directed a mass suicide and murder of more than 900 followers at Jonestown in Guyana in 1978. In his dying breath, Jones said it was \u2018all the media\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t believe them\u2019. 8. Praising his followers and boasting about how much he loves them 9. Use of music, vocal patterns, repetition of phrases Trump's clich\u00e9s and the loaded language from \u2018lock her up\u2019, build the wall, are all for mind control. 10. Us vs. them mentality Trump uses rallies where he can demonize his perceived enemies, from the media, globalists, radical left-wing Democrats, socialists, Hollywood actors, and the liberal media. 11. Sense of entitlement Trump exhibits the same sense of entitlement in evading paying tax, just like Sun Yung Moon, as well as a serious lack of empathy after Puerto Rico was wiped out by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and he refused to send money but instead went down and tossed out rolls of paper towels.\n\nThe clich\u00e9s he uses and the loaded language from \u2018lock her up\u2019, build the wall, and insulting nicknames for his opponents from Crooked Hillary and Pocahontas are all for mind control \u2013 to fan fear and implant phobias.\n\nHe consciously lied about questioning President Obama\u2019s birth certificate \u2013 to grab headlines.\n\nAll of these techniques are just another bullying behavior of an impulsive, incompetent president who rants on through his barrage of daily tweets sowing confusion and distorting reality, according to Hassan.\n\nTrump uses these rallies that he attends to help other Republicans get elected to office as charging stations where he can demonize his perceived enemies.\n\nHe exhibits the same sense of entitlement in evading paying tax, just like Sun Yung Moon, as well as a serious lack of empathy after Puerto Rico was wiped out by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and he refused to send money but instead went down and tossed out rolls of paper towels.\n\nHe expressed envy when he witnessed the massive number of people admiring North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Un and Russian President Putin under their regimes.\n\n\u2018He knows the cult playbook tactics\u2019, writes the author.\n\nHe uses false enemies citing the Mexicans, Muslims and media to reinforce the us-versus them thinking.\n\nHe sets up mass rallies with supporters wearing slogans on wardrobe and chanting slogans and he continually fans fear and implants phobias.\n\nLies are standard operating procedure and by 2017, Trump had told 2000 lies but that number climbed to 10,000 two years later, according to the Washington Post that\u2019s keeping a close tab.\n\nAgain, lies are \u2018right out of the Cult Leader Playbook\u2019, writes Hassan, and are used to stoke fear and hold onto power \u2013 just a business strategy to keep people watching.\n\nTrump has reinvented himself many times, and the latest from being a brash and controversial reality TV star to the most powerful person on earth, solely thanks to the Apprentice.\n\nHe had no ideal ideology other than the one he had as a businessman \u2013 which was winning.\n\nFred Trump first rescued his son and took him under his authoritarian wing when his cold mother cared little about her children.\n\nCult leaders Charles Manson, Jim Jones and David Koresh all had an absentee mothers and that created \u2018insecure parental attachment\u2019 as well as narcissism, writes Hassan.\n\nFred exposed his son to religion through Norman Vincent Peale, considered a cult leader when Peale claimed he was God\u2019s salesman.\n\nFred regularly took Donald into NYC to hear Peale speak and it was a highlight of Trump\u2019s youth spent in Queens.\n\n\u2018If you believe in yourself 100 percent and pray for financial success, God will grant you blessings\u2019, Peale preached.\n\nPeale used repetition and rhythmic vocal cadences as well as vivid imagery in his preaching and that effect remained with Trump all his life that he regurgitated for use with \u2018the Wall\u2019 and \u2018dangerous foes\u2019.\n\nFred Trump pumped up Donald by telling him, \u2018You are a killer. You are a king\u2019.\n\nBut when the little \u2018king\u2019 who was an aggressive little bully started collecting knives, Fred packed him off to military school where he continued to bully other kids and teachers as well.\n\nOne teacher from his military school recently remembered Trump as a troublemaker in school: \u2018Even then he was a little sh*t\u2019.\n\nThe Rev. Moon Sun Myung, at center, performs a mass wedding ceremony for 1,800 couples from 20 countries at Seoul's Changchung gymnasium on February 8, 1975\n\nTrump wanted to be recognized as handsome and charming but those two descriptions never came up in his profile description.\n\nHe had always been fascinated with Hollywood and movie making and desperately wanted to attend USC but he was rejected because of lousy grades so he turned to Fordham University in the Bronx, a Jesuit school.\n\nAfter two years, he transferred to the Wharton school at the University of Pennsylvania where he graduated without honors.\n\nFrom there it was business with dad who had a longstanding reputation for being a swindler who went after mid and low income housing in New York\u2019s outer boroughs.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard was the founder of the Church of Scientology\n\nFred had a reputation of being mobbed up and made use of mob-owned construction companies.\n\nHe was pals with Roy Cohn, Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s chief council and fixer during his communist and homosexual witch hunts in the \u201850s.\n\nCohn became Trump\u2019s lawyer and fixer in the early eighties when he was looking to escape his father\u2019s outer-boroughs empire and move into Manhattan\u2019s real estate world.\n\nBut first Trump had to borrow more than $60 million from dad to start his business in New York, hang out at trendy nightclubs and bars with models \u2013 and learn the ways of Cohn.\n\nCohn had a reputation for attacking, never apologizing, stopping at nothing to reach his goals, distracting his opponents as well as lying and cheating.\n\n\u2018Those are the rules of war. Donald learned that from Roy\u2019, stated Trump adviser and Cohn prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Roger Stone.\n\nWhen Trump was cast as host of the Apprentice, he was labeled as a D-lister. He was a clown-like figure who couldn\u2019t be taken seriously.\n\n\u2018We knew Trump was a fake...but we made him out to be the most important person in the world, made the court jester the king\u2019, stated the show\u2019s supervising editor, Jonathan Braun.\n\nThe smoke and mirrors rehabbed Trump\u2019s image into a \u2018Master of the Universe\u2019 and the show was the single biggest factor that put Trump in the national spotlight.\n\nAuthor Steven Hassan is a noted cult expert and Harvard Medical School professor\n\nDamaging racist and sexist remarks are purported to be on those Apprentice tapes that have been secreted away.\n\nShows were also reportedly heavily edited because Trump was not articulate.\n\nTrump ran with the notoriety of the show after fourteen years to promote his self-branded companies and seek out licensing deals.\n\nFollowing the cult leader profile, Trump is known to lie, cheat and steal with no empathy, no conscience in his own businesses.\n\n\u2018The question is to what extent does Trump exhibit a similar malignant narcissistic profile of a destructive cult leader just like Moon\u2019, asks the author.\n\nHe uses the same arsenal of indoctrination techniques to grab attention and devotion \u2013 \u2018shunning, shaming, expulsion and physical punishment\u2019.\n\nTrump has more than 3500 litigations in the courts that he has used to harass and discourage people. He was the plaintiff in 1900 cases.\n\nTony Schwartz, Trump\u2019s ghostwriter, wrote, \u2018Trump felt compelled to go to war with the world. It was a binary, zero-sum choice for him: you either dominated or you submitted. You either created and exploited fear or you succumbed to it\u2019.\n\nNow the Republican Party under Trump has been transformed into its opposite. It used to be about deficit spending but since taking office, Trump has racked up a trillion dollar federal deficit.\n\nThere are a variety of cults, according to Hassan, including political cults that \u2018deceptively recruit, indoctrinate, and ultimately control the lives of their members\u2019.\n\n\u2018It may be hard to view the president of the United States in this light --- but the warning signs are in plain sight\u2019.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not their beliefs that define these groups as cults but the way they deceptively recruit, indoctrinate and ultimately control the lives of their members\u2019, writes Steven Hassan, who warns again not to ignore the lessons of history.\n\n", "description": "In his upcoming book The Cult of Trump , mind control expert Steven Hassan claims that Trump has copied dictators and cult leaders throughout history.", "authors": ["Caroline Howe For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19503918-0-image-a-44_1570643828713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
