She suffered organ failure and later died of her injuries.\n\nSpeaking after the inquest last Wednesday, Ms Moffatt had said her daughter was an 'incredible mum,' and said she would never stop trying to get more answers surrounding her death.\n\nMrs Moffatt (left) had vowed 'never to give up fighting for justice' for her daughter Kelly Slater (right)\n\nKelly Slater, 33, was taking selfies and videos on her mobile phone when her go-kart spun out of control on December 27 2017 and the vehicle crashed into some tyres\n\nMs Moffatt said after the hearing: 'We just feel like that inquest was a waste of time.\n\n'We've just been working on everything including a translation of a police report but we have had no help.\n\nPictured: Teaching assistant Kelly Slater\n\n'We just feel all this has been covered up as regards the health and safety negligence.\n\n'I believe there were no tyres on that part of the track meaning she just went off it. We gave all this information that we'd found out to the coroner but nothing happened.\n\n'We understand the go karting place have completely retracked their circuit and got brand new cars - all things that should've happened before.\n\n'Kelly flew 16m down a ravine and landed on an adjoining farm. If there had been tyres around the whole track she would've been injured but she'd still be here to tell her tale.\n\n'We've had no help from Spanish police and not even heard from the business itself. Not even condolences, no compensation no nothing.\n\n'The last two years have been incredibly hard. No answers. No justice. Ringing around but nothing.\n\n'We thought we'd get somewhere with this inquest but it was a complete waste of time. We will always fight for Kelly. They are trying to relate it all to the fact she had her phone out but there were only two of them on the track at the time.'\n\nAn inquest into the mother-of-one's death today heard she had been drinking beforehand and was wearing flip flops, a loose-fitting helmet and no seat belt when her go-kart at the Karting Las Americas track (pictured) crashed\n\nFamily friend Sara Nicholls said everyone who knew and loved Ms Moffatt had been left in a state of 'utter shock.'\n\nShe said: 'Barbara had been disappointed at the outcome of the inquest and felt as though she still had many unanswered questions about Kelly's death. But she had been okay after we left Burnley Magistrates' Court and we all knew we were never going to give up fighting for justice.\n\n'We can't even start to get our heads around this, she was so loved and would have done anything for anyone. It is as though she has died of a broken heart. We just feel as thought she wanted to be with Kelly.'\n\nFriends are now rallying around Ms Moffatt's eight-year-old grandson Archie, who she had been helping to care for after his mother died.\n\nHundreds of people have now paid tribute to Ms Moffatt, with more than \u00a32,700 raised for her funeral on a GoFundMe page.\n\nShe leaves her two sons Aiden and Wayne.", "description": "Barbara Moffatt, 63, was found dead in her home in Burnley the day after she vowed she would 'never give up fighting for justice' at her daughter Kelly Slater's inquest.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19484114-0-image-a-2_1570614730265.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
