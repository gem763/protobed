Trump's action has opened the door for a Turkish military attack on Syrian Kurds who have been aligned with the U.S. in fighting the country's long-running war.\n\nTrump kicked off the meeting bragging about his 'nasty' letter to Turkish President Recep Erdogan, according to a Democrat familiar with the meeting.\n\nIn the letter, Trump warned the Turkish leader, with exclamation points, not to be 'slaughtering' the Kurds.\n\nPelosi mentioned the House vote and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, started to read the president a quote from former Defense Secretary James Mattis on the need to keep U.S. troops in Syria to prevent a resurgent of Islamic State fighters.\n\nBut Trump cut Schumer off, complaining that Mattis was 'the world's most overrated general. You know why? He wasn't tough enough.'\n\nTrump went on, 'I captured ISIS'.\n\nTrump also told lawmakers that 'fewer than 100' ISIS prisoners have escaped and they're the 'least dangerous ones'.\n\nTrump published this photo from inside the meeting of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, flanked by (left) Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and (right) House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer saying: 'Do you think they like me?'\n\nTrump tweeted this picture of the empty chairs left by the three Democratic leaders when they left following the White House meeting on Wednesday\n\nPelosi explained to Trump that Russia has always wanted a 'foothold in the Middle East,' and now it has one with the U.S. withdrawal.\n\n'All roads with you lead to Putin,' Pelosi said.\n\nThen it began.\n\nTrump said to Pelosi: 'I hate ISIS more than you do.'\n\nPelosi responded: 'You don't know that.'\n\nSchumer intervened at one point and said: 'Is your plan to rely on the Syrians and the Turks?'\n\nTrump replied: 'Our plan is to keep the American people safe.'\n\nPelosi said: 'That's not a plan. That's a goal.'\n\nTrump turned to Pelosi and complained about former President Barack Obama's 'red line' over Syria. According to Schumer, he then called her 'a third-rate politician'.\n\nAt that point, the genteel Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the House Majority Leader, interjected, saying 'This is not useful.'\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi walks out of the White House with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer\n\nPelosi and Hoyer then stood and left the meeting. As they did, Trump said: 'Goodbye, we'll see you at the polls.'\n\nFrom the White House driveway, Pelosi told reporters Trump was having some kind of 'meltdown' inside. She said they had to leave because Trump was unable to grasp the reality of the situation.\n\nLater, she would insist he even botched the insult, calling her 'third-grade' rather than 'third-rate.'\n\nShe said the impeachment inquiry never came up during the meeting.\n\nTrump insisted later on Twitter that it was Pelosi who had a 'total meltdown', calling her 'a very sick person!'\n\nHe also tweeted pictures from the room.\n\n'Do you think they like me?' he asked mockingly about one that showed Pelosi and Schumer looking exhausted and glum.\n\n'Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!' he tweeted with another.\n\nIn that photo, Pelosi can be seen, surrounded by congressional leaders and military brass around a table at the White House, finger outpointed. She is standing up, literally, to Trump.\n\nPelosi turned the photo into the banner on her Twitter page.", "description": "It was a White House meeting on Syria policy that quickly turned explosive on Wednesday when President Donald Trump called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0a 'third-grade' politician.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/03/19817474-0-image-a-61_1571278829093.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
