Others expressed anger over the president\u2019s abandonment of Kurdish allies in Syria\u2026\n\nA few Republicans are starting to say they flat-out won\u2019t [defend] it anymore \u2014 particularly the president\u2019s choice of his Trump National Doral Miami golf resort for next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit of world leaders, a selection that will benefit him financially.\n\n\u201cYou have to go out and try to defend him. Well, I don\u2019t know if I can do that!\u201d steamed a frustrated Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). \u201cI have no doubt that Doral is a really good place \u2014 I\u2019ve been there, I know. But it is politically insensitive. They should have known what the kickback is going to be on this, that politically he\u2019s doing it for his own benefit.\u201d\u2026\n\nMeanwhile, several GOP lawmakers have reached out to White House officials to urge Trump to reconsider his Doral decision, which they worry smacks of corruption, according to GOP officials familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly. At the very least, they\u2019re pressing Trump to publicly commit to hosting the international leaders free, to avoid any appearance that he\u2019s using his office to enrich himself.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
