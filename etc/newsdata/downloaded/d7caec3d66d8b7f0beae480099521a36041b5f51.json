up from 74 per cent when the sector was previously polled 10 months ago - and profitability.\n\nNearly two thirds also said a no-deal Brexit will hamper their ability to win overseas businesses and will also struggle to invest in their UK operations.\n\nAlmost three quarters of automotive firms have already put in place additional measures to prepare for the possibility of no deal.\n\nThe UK's motor industry has arguably been the sectors hardest hit by Britain's impeding divorce from the EU\n\nThis includes around half of businesses spending extra money on stockpiling and warehousing to mitigate against the risk of border delays and production stoppage.\n\nMeanwhile, a third have made adjustments to logistics and shipping routes, and over a quarter have been forced to invest hard-won profits in new customs infrastructure, despite a recognition that such systems cannot guarantee against border delays in the event of no deal.\n\nMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said this latest survey revealed the 'bleak future that awaits this vital sector' in the event of no deal.\n\n'Damage has already been done: investment is haemorrhaging competitiveness being undermined, UK jobs cut and vast sums wasted on the impossibility of preparing for no deal,' he continued.\n\n'Make no mistake, every day no deal remains a possibility is another day of lost investment, another day that makes it harder to recover investor confidence in the UK.'\n\nAround half of UK motor businesses have spent money on stockpiling and warehousing to mitigate against the risk of border delays and production stoppage\n\nHe suggested that the damage already caused to the sector was 'not irreversible' but a Brexit deal would need to be agreed to help firms bounce back.\n\n'A deal that, in the short term, enables a \"business as usual\" transition for as long as it takes to negotiate and implement the future trading relationship,' Hawes added.\n\n'In the longer term, that deal must replicate all of the benefits we currently enjoy which means an ambitious deal that delivers free and frictionless trade.\n\n'UK jobs, innovation, trading strength and economic growth all depend on the automotive sector so we urge all parties to get a good deal done before it is too late.'\n\nThe SMMT said car manufacturers would be crippled by 10% tariffs on completed vehicles under WTO rules because they're already operating on 'wafer-thin margins'\n\nSeparate SMMT research has suggested that some of Britain's biggest automotive manufacturers have spent more than \u00a3500million in an attempt to mitigate at least some of the risks of a no-deal scenario.\n\nHowever, it claimed that car makers will unlikely survive under World Trade Organisation terms and the application of 10 per cent tariffs on finished vehicles because they already operating on 'wafer-thin margins'.\n\nThe automotive sector is Britain's single biggest exporter of goods, trading with some 160 countries worldwide, and accounting for more than 14 per cent of total exports.", "description": "The SMMT said one in three UK motor firms are laying off staff with Brexit creeping closer, up from one in eight when it last surveyed the industry a year ago.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
