Politico first reported on the poll.\n\nMore than two-thirds of voters said Democrats\u2019 impeachment push was more about politics and that they should be more concerned about addressing issues of the day.\n\nA generic \u201canti-impeachment GOP candidate\u201d also held a 50% to 42% advantage over a \u201cpro-impeachment Democrat\u201d in the survey.\n\nAnd among voters in the 31 congressional districts that Mr. Trump carried and are represented by Democrats in Congress, 62% said the president\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that prompted a whistleblower complaint was not an impeachable offense.\n\nThe whistleblower alleged that Mr. Trump improperly tried to pressure Mr. Zelensky into investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son \u2014 a charge the president has denied.\n\n\u201cCongressional Democrats who represent Trump districts appear to be in a precarious position here, as their voters clearly side against impeachment and are much more willing to vote for a GOP candidate opposing impeachment than a Democrat supporting it,\u201d pollster Neil Newhouse wrote in a polling memo.\n\nThe survey was conducted from Oct. 1-3 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.46%.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
