Certainly, the Houston Astros have confidence for good reason on the brink of another World Series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Justin Verlander,\u201d reliever Ryan Pressly said.\n\nGeorge Springer and Carlos Correa each hit three-run homers and the Astros got another wild ace off the hook to beat the disheveled New York Yankees 8-3 Thursday night and reach the cusp of a second World Series visit in three years.\n\nThe Astros lead the AL Championship Series 3-1, putting the 2017 World Series winners a step away from a showdown with the NL champion Washington Nationals.\n\nHouston still has Verlander and Gerrit Cole queued up for this series, and the Yankees will have to beat both to survive. Verlander will start Game 5 on Friday night against James Paxton.\n\nSpringer lined an errant splitter from playoff star Masahiro Tanaka in the third inning for his homer, and Correa battered Chad Green\u2019s fastball when New York turned to its vaunted bullpen. Those All-Star sluggers have combined for just five hits in the series, but four have been homers.\n\nEarlier in the day, Astros manager AJ Hinch ardently denied that his team has skirted rules to steal signs after an allegation by the Yankees, which was investigated and cleared by Major League Baseball. He also made it clear: If a pitcher is tipping what\u2019s coming, Houston will take advantage.\n\nThe Astros are tired of that talk detracting from their sluggers.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s disrespectful that every time we score a lot of runs, people talk about tipping,\u201d Correa said. \u201cNobody was tipping today and we scored, what, eight runs? We\u2019re great hitters. We\u2019ve been doing it for a whole season.\u201d\n\nNew York worked starter Zack Greinke hard during a 28-pitch first inning, but just like against Cole in Game 3, the clutch hit never came. Pressly dodged a bases-loaded jam in the fifth, and many fans had left Yankee Stadium by the time it ended shortly before 12:30 a.m.\n\nThe Yankees are at risk of failing to make the World Series for an entire decade for the first time since the 1910s. They are 0 for 13 with runners in scoring position the past two games. Didn\u2019t help when they committed four errors in Game 4, most ever for the club in a home postseason game.\n\n\u201cWe played poorly tonight, there\u2019s no other way to explain it,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cAnd we need to flush this immediately.\u201d\n\nTanaka allowed four runs \u2014 three earned \u2014 for New York, his most in eight postseason starts.\n\nCC Sabathia pitched in relief for New York but was pulled with a left shoulder injury during the eighth inning. Planning to retire after the season, an emotional Sabathia covered his face with his glove as he left the field for likely the final time. Fans shouted his name as he walked off, and Cole and Springer were among the Houston players who stood and clapped for the 39-year-old.\n\n\u201cI hate to see that for him,\u201d said Hinch, who played with and against Sabathia. \u201cI hate to see that for the sport.\u201d\n\nGary S\u00e1nchez ended a lengthy postseason slide with a two-run homer, but a reshuffled Yankees lineup \u2014 still without injured Giancarlo Stanton \u2014 again couldn\u2019t string together its damage.\n\nDuring warmups, a buzzing Bronx crowd jeered Greinke with chants of \u201cDonald! Donald!\u201d \u2014 his given first name \u2014 and the veteran right-hander wobbled early. He walked three in the first inning for the first time since April 2007, including a four-pitch, bases-loaded free pass to Brett Gardner, and fell into a quick 1-0 hole.\n\nGreinke struggled especially to locate his fastball before blowing one past S\u00e1nchez during a three-pitch K to end the inning. He sharpened up and retired nine straight before the Yankees pushed him out of the game while loading the bases in the fifth.\n\nPressly struck out Gleyber Torres \u2014 on a tight check swing \u2014 and Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n to escape.\n\n\u201cSo far this series our bullpen has been huge to complement a really good starting rotation,\u201d Hinch said.\n\nGreinke was charged with just one run, working around four walks against the patient-but-punchless Yankees.\n\n\u201cJust missing by a little bit early,\u201d Greinke said.\n\nSpringer is batting .132 in these playoffs, slumping just like he did in 2017 before breaking out to win World Series MVP. This homer was his 13th in the postseason, snapping a tie with teammate Jose Altuve for the club record.\n\nCorrea made it 6-1 in the sixth. At 25 years, 25 days, he is the youngest player with 10 postseason home runs, surpassing Albert Pujols.\n\n\u201cI grew up a huge fan of Albert Pujols,\u201d Correa said. \u201cI even wear No. 5 all the way growing up.\u201d\n\nCorrea ended Game 2 with a home run in the 11th inning and connected again in October after missing a lot of time this year with injuries.\n\nS\u00e1nchez snapped a 2-for-23 skid to start this postseason with his two-run homer in the sixth.\n\nOtherwise, the AL East champion Yankees looked like they belonged in a lesser league. Sure-handed first baseman DJ LeMahieu booted two groundballs, Torres also made two errors at second, and reliever Adam Ottavino was pulled before getting an out for the fourth time in seven appearances this postseason.\n\n\u201cOur guys are studs and I think they embrace the challenge,\u201d Boone said. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve got our backs against the wall now.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: Stanton has missed the past three games after straining his right quad in Game 1. Boone said Stanton was available to pinch hit and could be New York\u2019s designated hitter Friday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPaxton said he watched tape from his Game 2 start and insists he wasn\u2019t tipping pitches. Houston grinded him out of the game after 2 1/3 innings. Verlander pitched two-run ball into the seventh, the only damage coming on Aaron Judge\u2019s two-run homer.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 They have the pitching, and they don't need the pitches.
