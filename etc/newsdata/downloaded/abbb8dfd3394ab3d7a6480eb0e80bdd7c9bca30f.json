We realised we could not possibly tell the end of these nine films without Leia. We realised that we had footage from Episode VII and we could use it in a new way.\u201d\n\nIt was announced last year that Fisher\u2019s family had approved previous footage of her being used for The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nHer brother Todd said in a statement at the time: \u201cAs we, her family, as well as her extended family of fans around the world so believe, Carrie\u2019s Princess Leia is forever entrenched in the franchise and her indelible presence is fundamental to the film.\n\n\u201cJJ Abrams understood Carrie\u2019s iconic role, and he has masterfully recrafted this final entry to include this unused and very last footage of Carrie ever taken, without resorting to CGI or animatronics.\u201d\n\nFans have already noticed Fisher's top billing on the poster and seem touched by the move:\n\nSmall but lovely detail -- on the poster, Carrie Fisher is the first name listed among the actors. pic.twitter.com/uEraZ3xUmG \u2014 Ned Raggett (@NedRaggett) October 22, 2019\n\nI just noticed that Carrie Fisher has top billing in this poster.
