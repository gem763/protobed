I thought all was fine until someone started speaking through the camera two nights in a row.\n\n'If you do have one, be very careful about what it can see!'\n\nAnother reviewer of the same camera complained: 'Strangers were viewing my family and speaking to us through the mic. Horrible Experience.\n\n'One evening the camera moved on its own and someone spoke to us, this was extremely unsettling... Was a horrible feeling knowing people had been viewing our everyday lives.'\n\nWhich? said it was 'worryingly simple' to gain root access to the Victure 1080p, which means having the ability to connect to, control and monitor a device as an administrator, so giving a hacker complete control of the camera.\n\nWHAT ARE THE DOWNSIDES TO THE INTERNET OF THINGS? 1. Your devices can spy on you (and your kids) 2. Many IoT devices are vulnerable to hacking 3. Your devices are never really yours, even after you pay for them 4. Your devices know your weaknesses 5. It's almost impossible to know what you're getting yourself into, or how long it will last 6) The law may not protect you\n\nOne reviewer of a related product, the Victure Baby Monitor Pet WiFi Camera, which is listed at \u00a319.99, wrote a review as recently as July, warning: 'Just now, I went to check on my baby physically and whilst leaning over her crib a voice emanated from the device's speaker and said 'hello' in a softly spoken female voice.\n\n'It sent chills down my spine.'\n\nWith the Vstarcam C7837WIP, the default username was set to the basic 'admin' and an easily guessable default password, a practice condemned by the government's code of practice covering products that connect to the web under the heading the 'Internet of Things'.\n\nThe Internet of Things refers to products that connect to the web via a WiFi link and can be controlled remotely through a smartphone, tablet, computer or home hub device, such as an Alexa smartspeaker.\n\nIncreasingly, household appliances, products and services, including everything from home cameras to lighting, heating, washing machines and dishwashers, will connect to the web in this way, becoming part of the Internet of Things.\n\nWhich? said it was 'worryingly simple' to gain root access to the Victure 1080p (pictured), which means having the ability to connect to, control and monitor a device as an administrator, so giving a hacker complete control of the camera\n\nThe ieGeek 1080p and Sricam 720p (pictued) cameras share an app and inbuilt security flaw.
