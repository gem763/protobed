He was recorded in November 2018 threatening to kill Tekashi 6x9 (right) on a phone call to another gang member\n\nHe begged a judge to take leniency on him, saying he had joined the criminal world at the age of just 15 and did not know any better.\n\nThe judge however handed him an 11 year sentence. He is the latest in a string of the gang's members to have been sentenced since the case erupted with Tekashi's involvement.\n\nThe rapper had been arrested along with others but 'as soon as he was in custody' agreed to testify for the prosecution.\n\nIt was a decision that alienated him from the Hip Hop community, but he hopes it will improve his chances of getting a lighter sentence.\n\nHe testified at the trial of Anthony 'Harv' Ellison, 31, and Aljermiah 'Nuke' Mack, 33.\n\nThey were convicted earlier this month of racketeering and gun-related charges.\n\nOver three days of testimony last month, the 23-year-old rapper unleashed a cache of damning details about the illegal acts he witnessed running with Nine Trey, painting his former associates as ruthless gang leaders who used intimidation and violence to further their own criminal activity.\n\nDefense lawyers attorneys for Ellison and Mack attempted to cast doubt on Tekashi's testimony by suggesting it was embellished because he hopes it will earn him a break at his own sentencing, where he faces up to 47 years in prison. The jury was shown the photo above of Tekashi posing with an assault rifle\n\nHe described being abducted and robbed at gunpoint after a falling out with Ellison - who was found guilty on a kidnapping charge related to that incident as well as for assault with a dangerous weapon.\n\nTekashi was charged along with five other Nine Trey members in November 2018 indictment outlining the gang's alleged involvement in drug sales and two shootings in New York City.\n\nOthers were brought afterwards.\n\nDuring his testimony he described how he joined the Nine Treys to gain street credibility in exchange for a cut of his music industry earnings.\n\nDefense lawyers attorneys for Ellison and Mack attempted to cast doubt on Tekashi's damning account by suggesting it was embellished because he hopes it will earn him a break at his own sentencing, where he faces up to 47 years in prison.\n\nThe rapper was labeled a snitch on social media after reeling off the names of other stars he says were involved in the gang, including Cardi B (who denies any association with the gang) and Jim Jones.\n\nHis testimony was so unreserved it prompted many to question how safe he would be on the outside, once whatever prison term he negotiated with the government is complete.\n\nTekashi already said he will not accept witness protection and hopes instead that the notoriety from the trial will reboot his career.\n\nTHE CASE AGAINST THE NINE TREY GANGSTA BLOODS\n\nTekashi was one of five people charged by federal prosecutors in an indictment last November.\n\nAn additional six were later charged, bringing the total to 11.\n\nAll but two pleaded guilty to a variety of crimes including racketeering, drugs offenses and firearms offenses.\n\nSome have been sentenced and some, like Tekashi, are waiting for their sentenced.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the other defendants cut deals like he did to win leniency for themselves.\n\nThe 11 charged were: Jamel Jones aka Mel Murda, Kifano Jordan aka Shotti, Jensel Butler aka Ish, Daniel Hernandez aka Tekashi 69, Fuguan Lovick aka Fu Banga, Faheem Walter aka Crippy, Dernard Butler, aka Drama, Kintea McKenzie aka Kooda B, Roland Martin aka Roe Murda, Anthony Ellison aka Harv and Aljermiah Mack aka Nuke.\n\nOver three days of testimony last month, 23-year-old rapper Tekashi - whose real name is David Hernandez - painted the Nine Treys as ruthless crew that used intimidation and violence to further their own criminal activity. He is seen in a leaked video from the courtroom\n\nMack and Ellison are the only two who did not plead guilty. Their trial is where Tekashi testified.\n\nAccording to prosecutors' indictment, they were all part of the violent Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods and committed, among other things, murder, robberies and drurg trafficking.\n\n'This gang...wreaked havoc on New York City, engaging in brazen acts of violence.\n\n'Showing reckless indifference to others\u2019 safety, members of the gang were allegedly involved in robberies and shootings, including a shooting inside the crowded Barclay\u2019s Center, and a shooting in which an innocent bystander was hit,' US Attorney Geoffrey S Berman said when the indictment was handed down.", "description": "Jamel 'Mel Murda' Jones, 39, was jailed for drug dealing and racketeering charges he pleaded guilty to in April this year.
