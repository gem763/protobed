It was devastating and horrible and is unprecedented too that they would do that to me,\" Barr, 66, told The Daily Mail in an interview released Tuesday.\n\n\"It was a perfect storm. That's what I think, just the perfect storm at the perfect time,\" she told the outlet. \"Kind of a little bit too perfect. Sometimes I think, 'Was this orchestrated? The whole thing?'\"\n\nROSEANNE BARR TALKS JUSSIE SMOLLETT, CALLS OUT ALYSSA MILANO AND DEMOCRATS\n\nABC canceled the \"Roseanne\" reboot last May after a tweet where she compared President Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to \"Planet of the Apes.\" She apologized at the time and blamed her remark on Ambien, but the damage was done. ABC launched a spinoff, \"The Conners,\" which killed off Barr's character.\n\nSince then, Barr says she's ditched Ambien \u2014 and her former co-stars.\n\nROSEANNE BARR SAYS MICHELLE OBAMA GOT HER FIRED OVER RACIST TWEET\n\nROSEANNE BARR TWEETS 'I'M FINE' AFTER RUMORS OF HEART ATTACK\n\n\"I've been [Ambien] sober for a year and a half since I got fired,\" she said. \"I haven't used Ambien and my life is really, really so much better and I really would like people to understand that. That's a very powerful drug that does a lot of negative harm to people who use it. I haven't used it since my Ambien tweet and you've got to be real careful. It makes you do whack stuff.\"\n\nBarr also reiterated her claim that her tweet wasn't the one that got \"Roseanne\" axed, alleging that co-star Sara Gilbert's tweet calling her remark \"abhorrent\" was \"the tweet that got the show canceled to be honest.\"\n\nROSEANNE BARR SAYS SHE'S 'NEVER PRACTICED' RACISM\n\nBarr hasn't kept in touch with her former co-stars since she got the boot from ABC, nor does she keep up with \"The Conners.\" She said of Gilbert specifically, \"When somebody just doesn't care how their actions affect you, what's there to talk about? There's nothing to talk about.\"\n\nAn outspoken supporter of Trump, Barr thinks her political leanings made her a target for the network despite the massive ratings success of \"Roseanne.\"\n\nROSEANNE SLAMS 'LOW-RATED' ABC FOR FIRING HER, KILLING OFF HER CHARACTER\n\nROSEANNE BARR COMES OUT AS 'QUEER'\n\n\"All of Hollywood, they just hate him and they hate those of us who like him. There is no way around it,\" she said of Trump. \"So, yeah, I think they took me off because I liked him and I like him because I'm a Jew and he likes Israel.\"\n\nIn March, Andrew Dice Clay announced that he and Barr would embark on the Mr. and Mrs. America Tour, something Barr says she looks forward to despite getting jitters ahead of their first performances this month.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I was really nervous ... you know, really nervous,\" Barr said. \"Dice talked me into it. He goes, people are wanting to hear what you have to say. I said, 'I'll do a couple, we'll see how it goes.' I love stand-up comedy and it's just a blast to be able to go do it and have backup in the form of another great comic.\"", "description": "Roseanne Barr believes she was fired from her eponymous sitcom revival because of a conspiracy against her spawned by her support for President Trump.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/et-story-use-only-eto_a04_roseannefolo_060118_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
