It's so unnecessary and that's why we need to consign the fur trade to the history books.'\n\nThe Only Way is Essex's Pete Wicks, who visited a fur farm where around 4,000 animals are housed, said the smell and the noise are 'indescribable'.\n\n'To be purchasing anything that is from a farm that is like this what you're saying is this is an ok way to treat animals.'\n\nFinnish animal rights organisation Oikeutta Elaimille, that visited the farms with Humane Society International, said that the appalling scenes are 'far from the exception'.\n\nTheir spokesman added: 'Small, barren cages and suffering of the animals are the norm in the fur industry.'\n\nThe animals were shown being kept inside small wire cages before they are killed for their fur\n\nThis fox stayed huddled in a corner of its cage when it was pictured by animal rights activists\n\nThis is a front view of a Finnish fur farm, an animal rights campaigner claimed that these appalling scenes are 'far from the exception'\n\nAn investigation by Humane Society International last year found mink, foxes and raccoon dogs forced to tear each other apart as they suffered in appalling conditions.\n\nThe miserable animals were left with open lacerations on their bodies while trapped in tiny cages in Finland before being taken to slaughter.\n\nFur farming confines animals for all their lives before they are harvested for the coat on their back - mink are killed by gassing and foxes and raccoon dogs are killed by anal electrocution.\n\nThe UK outlawed the practice in 2000 but continued to import coats from foxes, rabbits, mink, coyotes, raccoon dogs and chinchillas.\n\nMoving to stop this trade would make it the first country to do so, after regional authorities in West Hollywood, Berkley and San Francisco banned it.\n\nAfter the investigation last year Claire locked herself in a cage for 24 hours outside the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in London.\n\nAs a member of the European Union, the country is subject to European welfare codes on how to keep animals for this industry.\n\nMink are the most popular animals to keep on fur farms, followed by the blue and silver fox.\n\nThe trade bloc also bans the import and export of cat and dog fur.", "description": "WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT: Taken by animal rights activists from Humane Society International in Finland, campaigners hope it will re-ignite calls for ban on UK fur imports.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19876356-0-image-a-4_1571394435839.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
