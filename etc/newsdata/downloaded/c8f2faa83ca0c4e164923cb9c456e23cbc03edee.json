We must respect his or her 20-year efforts. Misjudgments are not allowed.\u201d\n\nAt these world championships, where Russia, China and Japan on Wednesday took gold, silver and bronze, respectively, in the men\u2019s team event, computer-assisted judging is being used on a limited basis, on four of 10 events: men\u2019s vault, pommel horse and still rings, and women\u2019s vault. Moreover, it is being used only for the \u201cD\u201d score, which reflects a routine\u2019s difficulty, and not the \u201cE\u201d score, for execution. And it is being used in one of two circumstances: when a gymnast or national governing body files an \u201cofficial inquiry\u201d disputing the judging panel\u2019s D score; or if there is a profound disparity between judges\u2019 \u201cD\u201d scores.\n\nIdeally, the technology will safeguard against the pitfalls of human judging, such as judging bias, whether willful or subliminal, or simple mental fatigue on the part of judges who lose focus after scrutinizing routine after routine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMoreover, according to Fujitsu and FIG executives, it will shorten event time by automatically generating \u201cD\u201d scores. They tout other applications of the computer-generated images, as well, which capture every phase of a gymnast\u2019s routine with yellow lines indicating their skeleton, along with precise data about their body positioning. For example: Are a male gymnast\u2019s arms perfectly 90 degrees from his body on the still rings\u2019 iron cross, or 89?\n\nSuch images, backed by precise data, could be invaluable for coaches during training.\n\n\u201cIt can measure things you can\u2019t see with the human eye,\u201d noted Steve Butcher, sports director and technical coordinator for the FIG, who has worked closed with the project since 2017. \u201cA coach may tell a gymnast that everything looks perfect, but it\u2019s not necessarily so.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe technology could also add entertainment value to TV broadcasts and cellphone apps. One day, it could represent potential revenue for gymnasts themselves, who, Fujitsu officials suggested, will be able to market and monetize their data.\n\nYet there are real-world concerns. Can the technology be fully protected against tampering or hacking? And how might a computer-based judging system evaluate an innovative, never-before performed skill by a gymnast who is bold enough to push the sport\u2019s boundaries, such as six-time world and reigning Olympic all-around champion Simone Biles?\n\nBrett McClure, a former Olympic silver medalist and the current high-performance director of the U.S. men\u2019s national team, concedes he has reflected on the range of pros and cons but favors the computer-based judging technology, seeing more good than harm in the extra set of eyes \u2014 even if those eyes aren\u2019t human.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe potential is awesome; just to have that kind of innovation and technology available is incredible,\u201d McClure said Wednesday, after the U.S. men rebounded from a disastrous qualifying performance to finish fourth in the team competition. \u201cI think it\u2019s gonna take some time to work out the kinks of how it\u2019s going to be most effectively used. I think it\u2019s a sign of the times, and we\u2019ve got to move with them.\u201d\n\nNot all gymnasts, however, consented to the full-body scan, which was not mandatory. According to a Fujitsu official, more than 90 percent of athletes did, including the U.S. men. The U.S. women\u2019s team, however, declined.\n\nNonetheless, the technology can still be employed without their personal data.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, their performances are evaluated against a standard body dimension, but officials concede that determining the position of athletes\u2019 joints is more precise, given the variation in athletes\u2019 muscle thickness, if the computer has individual data.\n\nAD\n\nDuring competitions, the data collection is inobtrusive. Multiple laser sensors that look like oblong speakers are positioned around the apparatus. When the gymnasts perform, their dynamic movements are captured in multiple spots by the lasers and transmitted to the judges, helping them \u201cview a performance\u201d from multiple distances and angles.\n\nJudges can call up a host of data that reveal, via the computer-generated skeleton of the gymnasts, the precise deviation of the body from the pommel horse, the piking angle of a body on a vault, the time that an athlete holds an element on still rings and so on.\n\nAD\n\nTechnology for the balance beam is currently under development. The hope is that by 2024, it will be perfected for all 10 events \u2014 the floor exercise being the most complicated.\n\nLike McClure, Mark Williams, head coach of the U.S. men\u2019s team, also endorses the technology. But he doubts it will ever fully replace human judges.\n\n\u201cIt is a subjective sport,\u201d Williams said. \u201c[Judging] is sort of a balancing of everyone\u2019s opinions \u2014 even the computer\u2019s. So you mix that into the equation and maybe you just double-check difficulties and angles and position and things that go into any evaluation by a judge. I think it\u2019s all fair game to get the right score.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Human judges may get help from artificial intelligence in time for 2020 Tokyo Games.", "authors": ["Liz Clarke", "Sports Reporter Focusing On Tennis"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cbebvmDFW5UI97t6x5a_tvLLovA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WBDIUFXKXII6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
