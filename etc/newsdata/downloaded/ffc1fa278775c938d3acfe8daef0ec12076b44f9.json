People see it on their way from the airport, and it immediately draws their attention.\"\n\nToday one of the pillars is empty, while the other is residential. The rotating restaurant was last open in the 1990s.\n\nKeen to capitalize on the interest, Belgrade authorities are now considering opening parts of another masterpiece of Yugoslav brutalism: the Palata Srbija government building, which is currently only open once a year.\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art stands in Belgrade, Serbia.

Initially allied to the Soviet Union, Tito broke with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948.\n\nResidential blocks, hotels, civic centers and monuments made of concrete shot up across the country.\n\nThe architecture was supposed to show the power of a state between two worlds \u2014 Western democracy and the communist East, looking to forge its own path and create a socialist utopia.\n\nBut after Tito died in 1980, and economic crisis took hold, the new elites sought to distance themselves from the socialist regime, including its architecture. In 1991 the series of wars began that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia.\n\nA crystal chandelier hangs beneath a nineteen meter dome weighing more than nine tonnes in Yugoslavia saloon inside the The Palata Srbija building, Belgrade, Serbia.
