A senior security official added that the 27-year-old man is from the town of Benndorf, about 24 miles west of Halle.\n\nAD\n\nOutside the targeted synagogue in the eastern German town of Halle, about 100 people assembled to mourn the two victims, as police officers stood by. But some of the mourners said the police presence came too late.\n\n\u201cHad there been police here yesterday, this would have ended differently,\u201d Max Privorozki, chairman of the Jewish community in Halle, told The Washington Post. He added that officials had rejected his requests for more police protection before the attack. \u201cThey considered the situation be under control,\u201d he said. More widely known synagogues and Jewish institutions in Germany are usually protected by police at all times.\n\nAD\n\nIgor Matviyets, 28, a resident of Halle and a member of the local Jewish community, said he and others had long felt unsafe. Anti-Semitic crimes have risen significantly in a number of European countries in recent years. Deadly synagogue attacks in Pittsburgh and in Poway, Calif., have also rocked the Jewish community in the United States.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven before the events of yesterday, I wouldn\u2019t have left my home with the kippah,\u201d Matviyets said, referring to the traditional Jewish skullcap, as he stood in the historic old town district targeted by the attacker.\n\nHis worst fears have now been confirmed, he said.\n\nWednesday\u2019s attack could have resulted in a far higher death toll if the attacker had entered the synagogue as planned, according to a manifesto released online and verified by security analysts.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe only narrowly avoided a terrible attack on those inside the synagogue. It could have ended much worse,\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday.\n\nIn his manifesto, the writer said that one of his aims was to \u201ckill as many anti-Whites as possible, jews preferred.\u201d\n\nIn chilling echoes of a far-right attack on two New Zealand mosques earlier this year, the helmet-mounted camera video from Halle shows the suspect arriving at the synagogue in a car. But his plan soon appears to go awry, as explosives and his firearm prevent him from entering the synagogue.\n\nAD\n\nInside the building, where 70 to 80 worshipers were present, a synagogue official almost immediately noticed the attack on a surveillance screen, said a witness, Christina Feist, 29.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe and others started barricading the front door,\u201d she told The Post.\n\nIn his live-streamed video, the attacker swears repeatedly as he is unable to enter and apologizes to his audience, at points blaming his homemade weapons, which included nearly nine pounds of explosives, investigators said. According to the manifesto attributed to the suspect, he also used 3-D-printed components to make his equipment.\n\n\u201cIt took 15 to 20 minutes for officers to arrive,\u201d Feist said.\n\nBy that point, the man already had allegedly shot a woman in the street and a man at a nearby kebab shop. Despite a shootout with the police, the suspect was initially able to escape, but he was later taken into custody.\n\nOliver Malchow, a representative of the police union, said the incident showed \u201chow thin the level of police coverage is.\u201d Speaking on public television, he also noted, however, that full protection of all religious sites is not feasible.\n\nWednesday\u2019s attack drew quick condemnation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, said in a statement: \u201cThe leadership of the international community must declare that in our post-Holocaust global society, there is no room for antisemitism, racism or xenophobia.\u201d\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier called Wednesday a \u201cday of shame and disgrace.\u201d Those who show even only a \u201cspark of sympathy for right-wing extremism and racial hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be complicit.\u201d\n\nOffering her condolences Thursday to the relatives of the victims, Merkel vowed to combat anti-Semitism by investing more in education and prevention efforts.\n\nJustice Minister Christine Lambrecht called for new measures to protect \u201cJewish fellow citizens significantly better,\u201d including more pressure on digital companies to flag threats to authorities.\n\nAD\n\nIn Germany, about 1,500 anti-Semitic verbal and violent attacks have been reported annually in recent years, but researchers say the actual figures are higher. One recent survey found that about 70 percent of anti-Semitic incidents go unreported, according to researchers at the Technical University of Berlin.\n\nAD\n\nA number of mainstream German politicians pointed at the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on Thursday, blaming its officials for radical rhetoric, even though it condemned the attack. Members of the AfD, said Green Party senior official Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, were still responsible for the transition from radical ideology \u201ctoward actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point where we finally have to come around and face the facts: Right-wing extremists, racists and anti-Semites will not only try to spread hatred, but also use violence,\u201d G\u00f6ring-Eckardt said.\n\nAD", "description": "The attack comes amid fears about rising anti-Semitism in Germany and Europe.", "authors": ["Luisa Beck", "Reporter Covering Europe The Washington Post'S Berlin Bureau", "Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VaaVFONszvPjIoQpf3VDuT7F_0k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P27HX2HLMQI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
