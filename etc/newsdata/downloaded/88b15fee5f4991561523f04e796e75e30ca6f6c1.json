There was also a colony established in Norfolk but there is little information on it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It may have been climatic or it may have been due to woodland management. Those are probably the main factors, but at the time there wasn\u2019t the same knowledge and scientific research.\n\n\u201cAfter it disappeared in the 60s it went back to being a very rare migrant and certainly it was not spotted every year. Since 2000 it\u2019s been turning up in increasing numbers,\u201d said Mr Tunmore who says it might be getting less picky about its habitat choice.\n\nIt has long been regarded as a holy grail among moth enthusiasts and there have been numerous sightings across the south of England and Wales this year. That suggests they are now colonising Britain, as opposed to just being a migrant.\n\nMr Tunmore said: \u201cClimate change is a very likely reason why it\u2019s coming in but it\u2019s hard to know what aspect of climate change might be helping it.\u201d\n\nRichard Fox, from the charity Butterfly Conservation, said: \u201cThere\u2019s never been a better chance of a thrilling encounter with this impressive insect. This year, the Clifden nonpareil is turning up all over southern Britain, in the Midlands, East Anglia and Wales, in Ceredigion and Monmouthshire, as well as in south coast counties.\n\n\u201cThe Clifden nonpareil is a fantastic addition to our wildlife and it is great to know that it is resident again in the UK, after an absence of 40 years or so.\n\n\u201cIts caterpillars feed unnoticed up in the canopies of aspen and poplar trees, so the adult moths are the best indication of how widely established this species now is.\u201d\n\nThe moth\u2019s forewings are camouflaged so it can blend in with tree bark or a stone wall. However, if it is spotted it snaps open its forewings and displays the bright blue colour which confuses the birds, giving the moth a few seconds to get away.\n\nPeople are being asked to record sightings of the Clifden nonpareil and other moths on the Moth Night website, which was founded by Mr Tunmore.\n\nHe said: \u201cSeptember is a special time for studying moths in the British Isles, with a colourful range of resident species mixing with more exotic species from Europe or even North Africa as warm air currents sweep them northwards.\n\n\u201cAlready this year, we have received reports to our migrant insect news service, Flight Arrivals, of Clifden nonpareil sightings from Cornwall, Devon, Sussex, Warwickshire, Suffolk, Dorset, Kent, Norfolk, Somerset and Northamptonshire.\n\n\u201cSome of these are likely to be immigrants and some part of the recently established resident populations.\n\n\u201cWhen we started Moth Night 20 years ago, this moth was a very rare immigrant but it is now becoming familiar to moth enthusiasts across southern Britain.\n\n\u201cThis illustrates just how quickly change can take place and that\u2019s why moths are such a fascinating group of insects to study.\n\n\u201cComing at the peak of the Clifden nonpareil season, Moth Night 2019 is a fantastic opportunity to map the current range of this species in Britain.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "A striking blue moth that was thought to have gone extinct in Britain 50 years ago has now recolonised and is breeding, conservationists have revealed.
