He said security forces fired teargas canisters and \u201cthousands of bullets\u201d towards the protesters.\n\nTekege said UN intervention was needed to bring peace to West Papua and asked \u201cinternational parties to support West Papua independence\u201d.\n\nThe Deiyai deputy regent has confirmed the death count at eight, the Jakarta Post reported. But police have disputed the toll, saying only one protester was killed, along with one soldier, and that security forces opened fire only after being attacked.\n\nWhy are there violent clashes in Papua and West Papua?

Many of them are being interrogated without lawyers, Emanuel Gobay, the director of the Papua Legal Aid Institute, told the Jakarta Post on Wednesday.\n\nThe protests were sparked by the racist abuse and arrest of Papuan students in Surabaya, on the island of Java, but have morphed into a broader political demand for a referendum on independence. A long-running independence movement has existed since Indonesia forcibly took control of the provinces in the 1960s.\n\nThe exiled leader Benny Wenda told the Guardian the deteriorating situation in West Papua required United Nations intervention.\n\n\u201cIndonesia is sending 6,000 troops on military exercises to West Papua. There is no war going on, this is peaceful demonstrators against a huge military. My people are in danger. We need to act now before it is too late.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:26 Indonesian paratroopers conduct military exercises over Papua \u2013 video\n\nIn a show of force, and perhaps an indication of a willingness to escalate military action if protests continue, the Indonesian military conducted exercises at Sentani and Wamena airfields in Papua. Footage from Jayapura showed dozens of paratroopers parachuting from the back of an airforce plane, part of a Quick Reaction Strike Force exercise.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s defence force chief, Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto, said the exercises were held annually at different locations across Indonesia, and this year was organised for Papua. \u201cThe jump drills ran smoothly and safely,\u201d he said.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s ministry of public works and public housing has dedicated IDR100bn (US$7m) for rebuilding state offices destroyed by protesters during protests in Jayapura in Papua on 29 August.", "description": "Activists say Buchtar Tabuni, seen as a mastermind of recent protests, was forcibly taken into custody by armed troops", "authors": ["Marni Cordell", "Ben Doherty", "Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f9e49458a4a2429ec3db48c4c61f0d960b8779/0_425_3923_2355/master/3923.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a38b40ad00b51f81fdca2ce7a1d9b122", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
