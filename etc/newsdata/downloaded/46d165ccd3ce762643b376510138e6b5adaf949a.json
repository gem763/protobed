Kathleen Hopkins and Jean Mikle, Asbury Park Press\n\nCandy cigarettes are one thing; prop cigarettes are another entirely, according to some of the Instagram masses.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Roger Mathews \u2014 Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley's ex-husband \u2014 shared a photo of their two children, Meilani and Greyson, dressed as \"bad\" Sandy Olsson and Danny Zuko from \"Grease,\" respectively. While a popular Halloween costume since the release of the 1978 movie musical, there was one controversial addition: prop cigarettes for the 5- and 3-year old.\n\nMathews anticipated the response, concluding his caption, \"Please comment on the fake cigarettes so I can block you. Please. They nailed the role and if you don\u2019t get it you most certainly would never get us. #Peace\"\n\nMathews' threat didn't deter everyone, as some braved blocking to make their displeasure known.\n\n\"Not liking it. They're too little,\" said one comment.\n\n\"How cute! Teaching this innocent little kid about cigarettes,\" sarcastically quipped another.\n\nBlowup backstory: 'Jersey Shore' JWoww, Angelina, Snooki Point Pleasant Beach meltdown\n\nMessy: Mathews claims JWoww Farley is trying to keep him from her money\n\nJersey Shore: JWoww calls estranged husband Mathews an 'abuser'\n\nHowever, Mathews' threat may have been a classic case of over-anticipating a negative reaction, as the majority of the comments seemed to praise how good the kids looked and supported the use of the fake cigarettes.\n\n\"They look adorable and roger let the haters sit there behide there [sic] phone and write hate comment all they want the kids look adorable and bet they had fun all that matter. \ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\" said one supporter, a common refrain.\n\nA lot of comments also lashed out at the perceived outrage.\n\n\"Its funny people try mad about the cigarettes but then let their kids have fake guns or axes pretending to kill people on Halloween.. these costumes are amazing I love it,\" read one of many similar comments.\n\nOthers took the highest of high roads: \"Could we please get this much outrage over climate change, poverty, and healthcare?\"\n\nJenni \"JWoww\" Farley, Nicole \"Snooki' Polizzi and Angelina Pivarnick at Teak Restaurant and Bar in Red Bank on Aug. 22, 2019.
