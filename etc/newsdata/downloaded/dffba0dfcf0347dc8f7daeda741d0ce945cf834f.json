(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nThe president\u2019s China tariffs may inflict short-term pain on American consumers, but it\u2019s a small price to pay to combat an existential threat to the U.S.\n\nWhen President Trump first took office, American tariffs on Chinese imports stood at 3.1 percent, little more than a barnacle on the hull of a $600 billion trading relationship. After the latest round of tariffs took effect on Sunday, that number stood at 21.2 percent, and if the next round is implemented on schedule, it will soon reach 30 percent. Economists and business leaders used to nervously reassure themselves that China tariffs were a temporary negotiating tactic to get President Xi to make concessions in a future trade agreement, but the truth is emerging that trade war is the new normal. The Trump administration has ceased talk of soybean-purchase agreements and begun talk of \u201cdecoupling.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to change our posture toward China from free trade to trade war is one of the most significant policy shifts in recent American history \u2014 and one of the most misunderstood.\n\nFree-trade advocates tend to think of tariffs as misbegotten economic policy, intended to give the American economy a leg up by protecting domestic businesses from Chinese competition. They point to data indicating that tariffs are injuring the American economy more than they are helping it, notably by increasing prices. Americans for Tax Reform has protested that China tariffs \u201charm American companies and consumers who rely on low-priced products to run their businesses and budget their households.\u201d The George W. Bush Institute has claimed that when consumers have to pay more for products, \u201cthe nation is less prosperous.\u201d Thomas Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, announced his opposition to trade war with China by noting that tariffs are \u201ctaxes paid for by American families and American businesses.\u201d\n\nDonohue is right that tariffs are a tax on American businesses, consumers, and investment. But we should be happy to pay taxes toward a worthwhile end. Indeed, if the end is important enough, and a tax helps us achieve it, paying could be a patriotic duty. The Chinese call this \u201ceating bitterness.\u201d\n\nFew ends are more important than economic growth, but the free traders err in assuming that a China trade policy that fails to immediately deliver more of it is bad, because one more-important end is geopolitical survival. The true value of the trade war lies in preventing American businesses from aiding the rise of an adversary.\n\nNOW WATCH: \u2018Trump\u2019s Chinese Tariffs Means It\u2019ll Cost Americans $1,000 More a Year Just to Live\u2019\n\nWatch: 0:44\n\nTrump\u2019s Chinese Tariffs Means It\u2019ll Cost Americans $1,000 More a Year Just to Live\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is pursuing a long-term goal of global hegemony. The foundation of its authoritarian system is high-tech surveillance, which it uses to monitor its citizens\u2019 every move. To build this panopticon more efficiently, China is seeking to lead the world in AI, telecom, and other advanced technologies, and so requires foreign companies that enter the Chinese market to \u201cshare\u201d some intellectual property while running aggressive industrial-espionage operations to take the rest.\n\nBecause China doesn\u2019t have the natural resources to dominate high-tech industries, it is also pursuing a neo-colonial foreign policy to acquire them. That requires power projection, so China has turned a dozen countries around the world into client states through debt peonage, collateralizing abusive loans with concessions for military bases and deep-water ports. Larger countries such as Pakistan and Burma have been brought into the Chinese orbit through dependence on infrastructure financing from the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, China\u2019s answer to the U.S.-led World Bank.\n\nChina\u2019s growth strategy represents a direct threat to the United States. Historically, the emergence of a peer competitor to an existing hegemon has always resulted in bloodshed. Beijing\u2019s economic expansion is already fueling a policy of military expansion in Asia, which threatens to bring China into conflict with American allies Japan, South Korea, India, and the Philippines. Optimists who believe that economic interdependence will forever forestall conflict must be made to explain why, following its integration into the world economy, China became more authoritarian and more militaristic rather than less. We should expect the trend to continue, not reverse. The Pentagon certainly does: Its 2018 National Defense Strategy is built around a shift from small wars to \u201cgreat-power competition\u201d with China.\n\nThis state of affairs raises many questions. Why is our industrial supply chain located inside of an adversary? Why does our military readiness therefore depend on that adversary? Why are American companies allowed to transfer critical technologies to China in exchange for short-term market access? Why can Tesla build self-driving cars in Shanghai? Why can Google run an AI lab in Beijing after canceling an AI contract with the Pentagon?\n\nThe free traders have an answer: because the market wills it. But of course, markets have no reason to prefer one global power over another, and there\u2019s no market rule barring a surveillance state from winning the competition. In that competition, our ideological commitment to free trade is nearly as great a handicap as the Soviet Union\u2019s commitment to central planning was during the Cold War. Free trade with China means allowing its distortions into our market. Refusing to allow our government to \u201cpick winners\u201d by rejecting industrial-policy support to key sectors means that Beijing will pick winners for us. Depending on Ricardian comparative advantage to organize supply chains means, in effect, that we will watch helplessly as American innovations are transformed into growth-boosting industries elsewhere, as firms reap efficiency gains by locating their engineering and management operations next to their manufacturing.\n\nInevitably, the innovation will depart too. A recent survey of 369 manufacturers found that American firms are moving their R&D operations to China not just to take advantage of lower costs, but to be in close proximity to their supply chains. Some 50 percent of foreign R&D centers in China are now run by American companies, helping China achieve first place in market share for manufacturing R&D. If we remain neutral as to where supply chains are located, \u201cwe innovate, they build\u201d will become \u201cthey innovate, they build.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nicholas Phillips", "Nationalreview.Com Us-China-Trade-War-Smart-Geopolitics"], "top_image": ""}
