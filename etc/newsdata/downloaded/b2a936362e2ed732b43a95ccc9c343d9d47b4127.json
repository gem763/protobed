And it\u2019s an architectural marvel, too.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The housing estate is comprised of almost 100 \u2018ultra low-energy homes\u2019.

The 105 creamy-brick homes are designed to stringent Passivhaus environmental standards, meaning energy costs are around 70% cheaper than average. The walls are highly insulated and the roofs are cleverly angled at 15 degrees, to ensure each terrace doesn\u2019t block sunlight from the homes behind, while letterboxes are built into external porches, rather than the front doors, to reduce any possibility of draughts.\n\nImmense thought has gone into every detail \u2013 from the perforated brick balconies to the cleverly interlocking staircases in the three-storey flats at the end of each terrace \u2013 to ensure that every home has its own front door on the street. The back gardens look on to a planted alley, dotted with communal tables and benches, while parking has been pushed to the edge of the site, freeing up the streets for people, not cars.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly proud moment for Norwich,\u201d said councillor Gail Harris, cabinet member for social housing. \u201cWinning this prestigious award shows that it is possible to build fantastic new council homes, despite the challenges posed by central government cuts and restrictions around right to buy receipts.\u201d\n\nCurrent rules mean that councils can only use receipts from council homes sold through the contentious right to buy policy to cover just 30% of the cost of new homes, with a tight three-year limit in which to spend it. Goldsmith Street was funded by a mix of borrowing, council reserves and right-to-buy receipts, but Harris said they could do so much more if the right to buy was reformed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The street won the annual Stirling prize ahead of a field of nominees including a house built from cork in Berkshire and a \u2018hi-tech and futuristic\u2019 distillery in Scotland. Photograph: Tim Crocker/Riba/PA\n\nThe architects won the original competition because they were one of the few firms to propose streets, rather than slabs of apartment blocks. They took inspiration from the city\u2019s Golden Triangle, a desirable neighbourhood of Victorian terraced houses, where the streets are laid out more tightly than modern overlooking regulations would allow. The architects used this precedent to argue that their new neighbourhood could be just as humanely scaled, while fitting in more homes.\n\nMarking the first time in the 23-year history of the Stirling prize that it has been awarded to social housing, the project beat stiff competition from the revamped London Bridge station, an opera house in a former stable block, the Macallan whisky distillery in Scotland, a visitor centre for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, and a house made entirely of cork. The decision represents a welcome contrast from last year\u2019s winner, Norman Foster\u2019s \u00a31.3bn headquarters for Bloomberg, which involved importing 600 tonnes of bronze from Japan and a quarry-full of granite from India, while claiming to be the most sustainable office building ever conceived.\n\nThis year\u2019s choice sends a clear message that, despite government cuts, it is eminently possible for brave councils to take the initiative and build proper social housing. With a recent survey suggesting that more than two-thirds of local authorities are directly engaged with delivering housing again, through a variety of methods, there may come a time when projects like Goldsmith Street are not an anomaly.", "description": "Street of 105 homes hailed as high-quality architecture in its most environmentally and socially conscious form", "authors": ["Oliver Wainwright"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ada88b527c7b9d95bef0474e1f902f6ce5416769/0_138_3203_1922/master/3203.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8ad4863640b3900dd6e1087b26663cc4", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
