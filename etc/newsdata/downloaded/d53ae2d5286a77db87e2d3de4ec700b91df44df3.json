There's a break now and I worry about what I have to do to try and beat Hearts. That's all I will focus on.\n\nFormer Spurs striker Jermaine Defoe bagged a hat trick and was the pick of the bunch\n\n'It's still very early days in the season. I have said to the players not to get carried away, there's a lot of hard work. We have still got to improve, we have still got to grow.\n\n'But the answer to the question is yes, we are better than last year, and yes, we are stronger. The 11 is stronger, the squad is stronger, and we've got people coming back from injury. So we're in a good place.'\n\nGerrard added: 'Look, it's October. There's still tons and tons of football to be played.\n\nSunday's win puts Rangers top of the Scottish Premiership ahead of arch rivals Celtic\n\n'This time in the last block of fixtures we lost an Old Firm 2-0 and a lot of criticism came our way, and rightly so because we didn't perform well enough on the day. So we all deserved that.\n\n'This time round we have won four out of four in the league and lot of strong, positive performances, especially here at home, we have shown a lot of hunger and aggressive play about us.\n\n'So that's what I am looking for, but it's October and there's no point worrying about where we stand in the league or getting carried away.'", "description": "Rangers took advantage of Celtic's defeat at Livingston in emphatic fashion as Jermain Defoe's hat-trick, a Connor Goldson header and Borna Barisic's free-kick saw them grab the win.", "authors": ["Gavin Mccafferty", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/18/19366764-0-image-a-76_1570383579822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
