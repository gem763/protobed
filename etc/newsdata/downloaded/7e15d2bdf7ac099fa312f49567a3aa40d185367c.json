The bipartisan rebuke was approved 354 to 60 in a rare break with Trump by most House Republicans. \"Today we make clear that the Congress is a coequal branch of government and we want nothing to do with this disastrous policy,\" said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.). The vote came as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo headed to Ankara, Turkey, to press Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to accept a ceasefire. [The New York Times]\n\n2.\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) died early Thursday from \"complications concerning longstanding health challenges,\" his office said. Cummings was 68. The Baltimore Democrat did not return to his office this week after undergoing an unspecified medical procedure. Cummings was chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and had become a central figure in the House impeachment inquiry of President Trump. A former Maryland state delegate and trial attorney, he clashed frequently with the Trump administration, including in his committee's court fight over subpoenas for Trump's personal and financial records. In July, Trump blasted Cummings and his district, describing the congressman's hometown as \"rat and rodent infested.\" Cummings did not respond directly, but criticized \"racist language\" used by the nation's leaders. [The Baltimore Sun]\n\n3.\n\nNegotiators from Britain and the European Union reached a draft Brexit deal Thursday ahead of the start of a two-day EU summit. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs the EU to approve the deal at the summit, which starts Thursday, to pave the way for an orderly Brexit on Oct. 31. If the EU approves the revised divorce deal, British lawmakers, who have rejected previous proposals, will vote on it Saturday. Negotiators worked through the night Wednesday trying to finalize customs and sales tax regulations on trade between the Northern Ireland and Ireland. The proposal appeared to hit a last-minute snag when Northern Irish party allies Johnson needs to ratify the deal said overnight they could not support the proposal \"as it stands.\" [CNBC, BBC News]\n\n4.\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday tried to downplay the significance of his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria ahead of Turkey's offensive against Kurdish forces who helped the U.S. fight the Islamic State in the region. Trump said the Syrian Kurdish fighters were \"no angels.\" He added that the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, is \"worse at terror and more of a terrorist threat, in many ways\" than ISIS. Trump's characterization of the PKK, a militant Kurdish nationalist group that has launched attacks in Turkey, echoed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's depiction of them. In an Oct. 9 letter, Trump told Erdogan not to be a \"tough guy\" or \"fool,\" and warned him against \"slaughtering thousands of people\" in Syria. Erdogan reportedly threw the letter in the trash. [The Washington Post]\n\n5.\n\nFormer State Department official Michael McKinley, who served as a top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told Congress in closed-door testimony on Wednesday that he resigned over frustration with the Trump administration's undermining of career diplomats in Ukraine, The New York Times reported Wednesday, citing several people with knowledge of his statements. A person familiar with McKinley's testimony said he felt he had seen career diplomats \"mistreated\" and \"their careers derailed for political reasons\" while serving under Trump. McKinley spent 37 years in the State Department until his resignation last week, which appeared to have been prompted by Marie Yovanovitch's firing as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and the State Department's failure to \"defend\" her from partisan attacks. [The New York Times, The Washington Post]\n\n6.\n\nLeading congressional Democrats walked out of a White House meeting on Wednesday, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) saying they left after President Trump had a \"meltdown.\" The Democratic leaders went to meet with Trump about Syria shortly after the bipartisan House vote opposing Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria. Pelosi said Trump appeared \"shaken\" by how overwhelmingly the measure passed. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Trump unleashed \"a nasty diatribe, not focused on the facts,\" and the Democrats walked out. Trump reportedly got angry when Pelosi told him \"all roads with you lead to Putin.\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump \"was measured, factual, and decisive, while Speaker Pelosi's decision to walk out was baffling, but not surprising. She had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues.\" [CNN, NBC News]", "description": "1.The House voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to condemn President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria, which cleared the way for Turkey to launch its offensive against Syrian Kurds who fought alongside U.S. troops against the Islamic State.
