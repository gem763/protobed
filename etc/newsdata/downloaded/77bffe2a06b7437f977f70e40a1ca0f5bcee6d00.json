General Assembly meetings.\n\nBIARRITZ, France \u2014 President Donald Trump said Sunday that a trade deal with Japan \u201cis done in principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been working on a deal with Japan for a long time,\u201d he said at the G-7 summit alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and teams from both countries. \u201cIt involves agriculture and it involves e-commerce and many other things. It\u2019s a very big transaction, and we\u2019ve agreed in principle.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBoth Trump and Abe said they expect to sign the deal around meetings of the United Nations General Assembly next month in New York. They asked aides to accelerate negotiations over unfinished aspects of the trade deal in order to have a final agreement prepared in time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to every point and now we\u2019re papering it and we\u2019ll be signing it at a formal ceremony,\u201d Trump said.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the preliminary agreement is three-fold, addressing industrial tariffs, agriculture and digital trade. It does not eliminate 2.5 percent tariffs on Japanese vehicles or major auto parts, he said. Japan has repeatedly asked the Trump administration to lift the tariffs in previous negotiations.\n\n\u201cThere are a series of industrial tariffs that are being reduced. Auto tariffs are not in that group,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nHowever, the deal, if finalized, is expected to eliminate the possibility that Trump could impose a 25 percent tariff on Japan's auto and auto parts exports to the United States, as he has threatened to do in the past.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed the news but urged the Trump administration to strike a more comprehensive agreement with Japan that also covers issues such as services trade, regulatory barriers and intellectual property protection.\n\nThe United States had agreed a comprehensive trade agreement with Japan as part of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, but Trump withdrew from that pact on his third day in office. As a result, U.S. exporters have been losing sales in Japan to the remaining TPP nations and the EU, which has a separate trade pact.\n\n\u201cAmerican companies and agriculture exporters are at a clear disadvantage to their Asia-Pacific and European counterparts in the absence of a comprehensive trade deal with Japan,\" the Chamber said in a statement.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

He described the digital trade provisions as setting a new international \"gold standard.\"\n\nThe two countries have spent months negotiating behind closed doors and White House officials told POLITICO ahead of the G-7 summit that Trump had hoped to strike an agreement with Japan to underscore his claim that he is making progress on trade. However, the Obama administration achieved a more a comprehensive agreement with Japan as part of the TPP, without threatening to impose punitive duties on Japan's auto exports to the United States.\n\nThe possibility of a deal was thrown into uncertainty earlier Sunday after Trump and Abe offered vastly different assessments of North Korea\u2019s nuclear development program and ballistic-missile tests.\n\nDuring a bilateral meeting, Trump said the recent launches of two short-range ballistic missiles by North Korea did not violate UN Security Council resolutions that prohibit Pyongyang from testing nuclear or ballistic missiles. Abe called the latest tests \u201cextremely regrettable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been doing nuclear testing. He has done short range, much more standard missiles. A lot of people are testing those missiles, not just him,\u201d Trump said of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nTrump added, \u201cWe\u2019re in the world of missiles, folks, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nDoug Palmer contributed to this story.", "description": "Trump and Abe announced the agreement at the G-7 summit in France, with hopes for a formal signing in September alongside U.N.
