Add Interest\n\nHowever, for about 2 1/2 weeks, this unassuming office turns into buzzing political hub as presidential candidates (or their designated representatives) stream in with staff and supporters in tow and the media gathers around to watch the candidates fill out the paperwork to get on the ballot in New Hampshire -- home to the first-in-the-nation primary.\n\nThe primary is expected to take place in February, and although New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner has not set the exact primary date yet, it is expected to take place on February 11.\n\nGardner, who has been the state's secretary of state since 1976, said that every U.S. president has won at least one New Hampshire primary since Dwight D. Eisenhower won the 1952 primary. Richard Nixon won the primary three times.\n\n\"This is a very open, inclusive primary, it's not exclusive,\" Gardner told ABC News. \"Many states, the secretary of state just decides who gets on the ballot. But here, it's wide open for anyone who wants to have a chance to run for president, they can come here, file, and have their chance.\"\n\nThe campaigns have been increasing their staff in the Granite State ahead of the nation's first primary. The Buttigieg campaign has one of the largest staffs on the ground with roughly 60 staffers, while Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is at the other end of the spectrum with a much smaller contingent.\n\nMuch like the process in 2015, this election cycle's candidates will fill out their paperwork at the desk of Stephen A. Bullock, the New Hampshire legislator who sponsored the original measure that established the state's primary. The desk was donated by Bullock\u2019s family and is usually housed at the New Hampshire archives building just over a mile from the state house.\n\n\"We're using the desk to honor him,\" Gardner said.\n\nThe Bullock desk has arrived at the New Hampshire Secretary of State\u2019s office.

The bill passed the legislature in May 1914 and the first primary was held in 1916, one week after the Indiana primary.\n\nThe following election cycle, New Hampshire became the first in the nation to hold a primary on March 9, 1920, because Indiana had moved their primary back to May.\n\nIn 1975, New Hampshire passed a law requiring the New Hampshire primary to be the first in the nation. The law states that New Hampshire\u2019s primary \u201cshall be held on the second Tuesday in March or on a date selected by the secretary of state which is 7 days or more immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election, whichever is earlier, of each year when a president of the United States is to be elected or the year previous.\u201d This is \u201cto protect the tradition of the New Hampshire first-in-the-nation presidential primary.\u201d\n\nIn order to secure a spot on the ballot, presidential candidates, or their designated representatives, visit the secretary of state\u2019s office at the state house, pay a $1,000 filing fee in cash or a bank certified check and fill out the necessary paperwork. Candidates can only file to be on the ballot on weekdays from Wednesday, October 30, 2019 until Friday, November 15, 2019 from 8 am until 4:30 pm (except on Veteran\u2019s Day). To celebrate the centennial first-in-the-nation primary anniversary, Gardner says that there will be a special commemorative ballot used, just as they had done for the 2016 ballot.\n\nDarren Mccollester/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe campaigns arrange a time to file with staffers from the secretary of state\u2019s office so they can avoid having multiple candidates arrive at the same time.\n\nOnce a date and time is arranged, the public won\u2019t be able to find the calendar online. That information is only available by stopping by, or calling the office to find out when candidates are scheduled to stop by. The office writes the appointments in pencil on a printed out calendar.\n\nChristopher Donato/ABC News\n\nCandidates often turn the filing into a mini-celebration with their supporters. This year Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is holding a rally outside the New Hampshire State House after filing his paperwork.\n\nIt\u2019s not only high profile candidates who fill out paperwork to get on the ballot.\n\n\"In the filing period...we get a lot of interesting candidates to say the least,\" Gardner said.\n\nOne of those interesting candidates came to the attention of his office in 1980 when a gorilla named Colossus attempted to get on the ballot.\n\nChristopher Donato/ABC News\n\nGardner told ABC News that Colossus\u2019 campaign manager, a chimpanzee, had gone into the secretary of state\u2019s office to fill out the paperwork on behalf of Colossus. Gardner said that Colossus was born in Detroit and was living at an animal park in New Hampshire.\n\nColossus\u2019 owner had pointed out that New Hampshire law did not stipulate that those filing to be on the ballot had to be a human and said that the gorilla met the age requirement and the requirement of having been born in the United States to get on the ballot.\n\nGardner said he rejected Colossus\u2019 paperwork.", "description": "For years, presidential candidates have sought to get on the ballot in New Hampshire -- home to the first-in-the-nation primary.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/new-hampshire-state-house-gty-aa-191028_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
