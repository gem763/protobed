So it was hard to know what promise these pensions could make in return for the ability to opt out.\n\nWhat are 'pot of money' and final salary pensions? Defined contribution pensions, also known as 'money purchase', take contributions from both employer and employee and invest them to provide a 'pot of money' at retirement. More generous gold-plated defined benefit pensions, also known as 'salary related' or 'final salary' pensions, provide a guaranteed income for life after retirement.\n\nIn the end, it was decided that rather than allow workers and firms to pay NI contribution at a reduced level (as with defined benefit contracting out), instead the NI rebate would simply be paid as a cash amount into the pension fund.\n\nThis money would be invested and could be used to buy a pension at retirement. So, from 1988, it was possible to be part of a 'contracted out' workplace pension run on a 'pot of money' basis, and it was also possible to take out an individual personal pension on this basis.\n\nSo keen were the government to encourage people to take out personal pensions that they allowed people to take them out on a 'rebates only' basis \u2013 in other words, without actually putting in any money of their own \u2013 and they also temporarily offered an extra National Insurance bonus to anyone who took out a personal pension.\n\nThis led to millions of personal pensions being taken out and also unfortunately led to 'personal pension mis-selling' where some people who were in perfectly good workplace pensions were encouraged to switch to personal pensions in order to take advantage of these NI rebates.\n\nAs it has turned out, the rebates that were paid into 'pot of money' pensions have in most cases not delivered nearly as much pension as people would have received had they stayed in the state scheme.\n\nThis is mainly because low interest rates and increased longevity have meant that the amount of pension you can buy with a given pot of money is much lower today than was expected when the rebates were set back in the 1980s and 1990s.", "description": "When I was contracted out and paying into a private pension I did not receive a deduction in National Insurance payments during this period.
