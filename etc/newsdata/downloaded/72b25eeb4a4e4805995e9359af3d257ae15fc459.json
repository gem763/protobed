Then another. And another. Until they scrolled through all 43 frames from the exclusive photoshoot.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nA huge chunk of their precious 300 photos were gone. To make matters worse, they had been taken in a location far from the reception, meaning the bridesmaid, her family and the photographer had sneaked away purposely to do them in private.\n\nThe unhappy newlywed finishes the post headed Am I Being Unreasonable? by saying her bridesmaid has just messaged her asking her to see the wedding pictures and she was yet to reply.\n\nWith everyone agreeing she is right to be livid, attention quickly turned to how she could get her own back.\n\nOne commented: \"Oooh, you could have so much fun with this. Transfer all the pics onto another memory stick minus her 43. Go through them and play dumb. Watch her squirm!\"\n\nOthers thought the photographer was the one in the wrong, suggesting she pays a reduced rate and advises them to chase the bridesmaid for the rest.\n\nWhatever happens, we wouldn't swap places with either of them right now.", "description": "Her bridesmaid has messaged asking to see the photos and she's not sure what to reply", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images Vetta", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20129611.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Bridesmaids-helping-gorgeous-bride-to-dress-up-and-get-ready-for-her-wedding-ceremony.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
