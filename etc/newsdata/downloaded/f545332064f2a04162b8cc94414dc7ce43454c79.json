(David Weigel/The Washington Post)\n\nJACKSON \u2014 Jim Hood, the Democrat running for governor of Mississippi, started his Labor Day remarks with his highest possible compliment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not many groups that would get me out of a dove field on Labor Day, expect for working people,\u201d Hood told a crowd of labor organizers and Democrats in a downtown Jackson park. \u201cWorking people have been kicked to the curb.\u201d\n\nHood, first elected to the attorney general\u2019s office in 2003, is the last Democrat still holding statewide office in Mississippi. His party has never been weaker in the state, reduced to a super-minority in the legislature and losing power in rural counties with every election this century.\n\nYet both parties agree that Hood is in a competitive race for the governor\u2019s office, thanks in part to his last-moderate-standing image \u2014 he is serious about the dove hunts \u2014 and thanks to Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, the Republican who locked up his party\u2019s nomination after an unexpectedly heated primary.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a liberal Democrat, he has been for 16 years, he continues to be, and that's okay,\u201d Reeves said of Hood after a Tuesday visit to a supporter\u2019s farm equipment factory near Jackson. \u201cThere are some people in Mississippi that are looking for a liberal Democrat to represent them in the governor's office. But if you are a conservative, I think that you only have one option.\u201d\n\nPublic polling has found Reeves ahead of Hood by single digits, while Democratic polling has put the race at a tie, with Hood slightly favored. Either set of numbers represents the first real race for governor in years; last time, the Democrats were so weak that a truck driver who barely campaigned won their nomination.\n\nHood, who has been out-fundraised by Reeves, reintroduced himself to voters with ads about stopping \u201cchild pornographers\u201d and going to \u201cchurch on Sunday.\u201d Reeves spent the summer fending off Bill Waller, the state\u2019s former chief justice, and Robert Foster, a conservative state senator. Both of them endorsed the expansion of Medicaid \u2014 anathema for Republicans just a few years ago \u2014 and Waller endorsed a higher gas tax. Hood sat back and watched.\n\n\u201cTate Reeves spent $3 million on just TV this summer and I spent $262,000,\u201d Hood said. \u201cWe were ahead in June, then he spends $3 million on TV, and we're still ahead. I don't see his avenue, you know? I don't know if the pope could help him.\u201d\n\nRepublicans see a clear path to victory for Reeves: Be a Republican. Since 2003, the party has never given up a statewide office once winning it. (It has not won the attorney general\u2019s office since Reconstruction but is favored to in November.) The two high-water marks of Democratic strength this century were special elections for the Senate, in 2008 and 2018, when they lost by 10 and seven points. Even Democrats assume that the president will eventually endorse and rally for Reeves, and expect that to solve most of the nominee\u2019s base issues. It happened in 2018; it would make sense if it happened again.\n\n\u201cWhat typically happens after primaries is that 90 percent of Republicans end up coming home,\u201d said Henry Barbour, a Jackson-based lobbyist and Republican National Committee member. \u201cThe last thing the president is going to want is to lose a conservative governor\u2019s office heading into 2020. That will bring home a lot of voters who voted for change in 2016.\u201d\n\nWaller\u2019s first show of strength came at \u201cteacher town halls,\u201d in which he organized voters who were furious at the lieutenant governor; Reeves had snuck $2 million in school voucher funding, previously killed by the GOP\u2019s supermajority, into an unrelated construction bill. Other Republicans experimented with euphemisms to explain why the wonkish Reeves, who won his first election before he turned 30, struggled to connect to voters like Waller or even Hood did.\n\n\u201cPeople like to vote for people who are likable,\u201d Gov. Phil Bryant told Mississippi Today before the primary, praising Waller\u2019s charisma and style even though he\u2019d endorsed Reeves as his successor.\n\nReeves\u2019s defeat of Waller was decisive; asked about the margins, especially in suburbs where Waller did best, Reeves emphasized that Republican turnout hit record highs. But after attacking Waller as a Democrat in disguise, Reeves watched around 46 percent of Republicans vote for his policies. (Waller told Mississippi Today this week that he would not endorse Reeves.)\n\nThat set up a theoretical path to victory for Hood. First, motivate the party\u2019s African American base, freshly organized from Mike Espy\u2019s unsuccessful 2018 Senate run. Next, convert the moderate Republicans who\u2019d rejected Reeves into Democrats, by running against Reeves as an ideologue who\u2019d cut corporate taxes while rejecting money that could save rural hospitals.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 dislike of Reeves has, for the moment, submerged any of their qualms about Hood. In conversations around Jackson, Democrats often cited something they\u2019d broken with Hood on \u2014 his defense of the state\u2019s \u201cheartbeat\u201d antiabortion bill, his punt on questions about this summer\u2019s raids of undocumented immigrants. Just as quickly, they said they\u2019d be voting for Hood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m voting for him, but it\u2019s by process of elimination,\u201d said Patricia Ice, an attorney at the Mississippi Immigrants Right Alliance.\n\n\u201cTate\u2019s evil,\u201d said Natalie Maynor, a retiree who\u2019d heard Hood address the Labor Day picnic. \u201cNone of us liked Phil Bryant, but he wasn\u2019t as horrible as the Tater Tot.\u201d\n\nReeves, who said the race was \u201creset to zero\u201d after the runoff, said he would happily run on conservatism, low taxes and jobs.\n\n\u201cThis is the best economic condition Mississippi's ever been in,\u201d Reeves said Tuesday.\n\nBut Hood, who watched Waller draw close to Reeves without running negative ads, is not planning on the same light touch. He\u2019d talked to Waller since the runoff, he said, and was confident that he wouldn\u2019t endorse Reeves. He was just as confident that attempts to portray him as Hillary Clinton or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) would flop.\n\n\u201cI don't fit that mold,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I reload guns. I'm pro-life. People have seen my record for 16 years, so it gives a comfort level to Republicans to cross over.\u201d\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\u201cOn Labor Day, presidential candidates turn the conversation to guns,\u201d by Cleve R.

(Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe coming of Hurricane Dorian had the potential to freeze the 2020 primary, with candidates who weren't already making news being sidelined by coverage of the storm. The president's personal response to the storm, however, has nudged Democrats into doing something they've only rarely tried: making fun of him. On the trail this weekend, several 2020 Democrats chastised the president, who said he was skipping a trip to Europe to monitor the storm, for playing golf.\n\n\u201cI think he just does not have the ability to really have a sense of empathy for people who are enduring hardship and enduring pain,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) told reporters. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s playing golf while all this is happening is not surprising.\u201d\n\nAt a press gaggle in Iowa, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg was even harsher. \u201cAs I recall, the president said he was remaining in the U.S. to deal with the emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cApparently, his idea of dealing with the emergency is to go golfing. To be fair, when he shows up in emergency zones, I'm not sure it helps or hurts, but it would be nice for him to at least show some respect for the Americans who aren't currently fleeing for their lives from evacuation zones.\u201d\n\nThose comments stood out because, unlike the GOP of the Obama years, the 2020 Democrats are cautious about mocking the president. Their fear, learned the hardest way in 2016, is that doing so only obscures their own messaging; the memory of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) flailing and apologizing after making fun of Trump during the Republican primary still resonates.\n\nBut recent Democratic polling has found that attacking the president as incompetent is more resonant than most ideological attacks on him. The golf mockery fits into that theory. \"A Category 4 hurricane is headed toward the East Coast and Donald Trump canceled his trip so he could monitor his golf handicap,\" DNC Chairman Tom Perez tweeted on Labor Day, responding to a tweet about the president returning to the links.\n\nDemocrats also think the attack could sink in because Trump himself invested so much in deriding President Barack Obama's golf habit. It was a theme of his 2016 pitch, in sync with Fox News: Obama was frittering away the power of the presidency, and letting crises mount, because he retreated to the golf course to play with friends.\n\n\u201cI love golf,\u201d Trump said during the campaign, \u201cbut if I were in the White House, I don't think I'd ever see Turnberry [in Scotland] again. I don't think I'd ever see Doral again; I own Doral, in Miami. I don't think I'd ever see many of the places that I have. I don't ever think that I'd see anything. I just wanna stay in the White House and work my a-- off, make great deals, right? Who's gonna leave? I mean, who's gonna leave?\u201d\n\nDoral, of course, is the site Trump is now pitching as a host for the next Group of 7 meeting. The activist campaign to get House Democrats lined up on impeachment made little headway in August. Democrats are far more comfortable with investigations or narratives that portray the president as a self-dealer who is playing games instead of governing. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a question about the Buttigieg and Harris attacks; he had, however, tweeted a defense of his golf habit in the process of attacking London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a frequent online enemy.\n\nLaura Hughes contributed reporting.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nMississippi Strong, \u201cNot Us.\u201d The Republican Governors Association, like many Washington-based party groups, often creates election-specific committees to run advertising through. In the Reeves-Hood race, that committee is \u201cMississippi Strong,\u201d which has been on the air for a month with a fairly straightforward attack ad, linking Hood to the Democrats' 2016 presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cHood stood with liberals in Washington and refused to fight to stop Obamacare,\u201d the ad says, a veiled reference to Hood's refusal to join lawsuits against the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHood even stood with Hillary, after she called Trump voters 'deplorable.' \" Hood, a delegate for Hillary Clinton in 2016, did support her in the general election.\n\nAndy Beshear, \u201cMy Family.\u201d The attorney general's office is generally a good place to launch another statewide run from; see Hood's story in Mississippi. Beshear, the Democratic nominee for governor in Kentucky, centers his latest ad on his decision to join most Democratic attorneys general and defend the ACA from a lawsuit filed by a rump of Republican AGs. \u201cI'm fighting to prevent insurance companies and the government from taking away coverage for preexisting conditions,\u201d Beshear says, a typically wordy description of what that lawsuit \u2014 a political time bomb for Republicans \u2014 is designed to do.\n\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox three times a week.

But this poll, taken after the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, but before this past weekend's shooting, found generic, high support for nearly every liberal gun control proposal. Even the \u201cbuybacks,\u201d so easily characterized as \u201cgun grabbing,\u201d had just 49 percent of registered voters opposed to them \u2014 more than enough to scare off swing- district Democrats, but not as high as the public opposition to a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the purchase of Greenland or a ban on private health insurance.\n\nIN THE STATES\n\nColorado. State legislator Mike Johnston, an early entrant in the race against Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, abandoned his bid Tuesday, saying he would not want to go negative against former governor John Hickenlooper.\n\nMinnesota. Republicans recruited former lieutenant governor Rebecca Fischbach to challenge Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson, whose western Minnesota district is now the most rural and most Republican represented by any Democrat; Barack Obama lost it by 10 points, and Hillary Clinton lost it by 31 points. Fischbach, who briefly held her statewide office after Democrat Tina Smith was elevated to the Senate, reintroduced herself to voters as a Trump loyalist, attacking Peterson for voting to \u201cban the wall.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania. Lou Barletta, the four-term congressman who presaged northeast Pennsylvania's swing toward the GOP, will not challenge the state's most vulnerable Democrat, Rep. Matt Cartwright. Barletta told the Times Leader that he would not \u201cclose the door\u201d on future runs for office \u2014 he's 63 \u2014 but would focus for now on launching a consulting firm. The 2018 court decision that reshaped Pennsylvania's maps put Cartwright in a seat that backed the president by nine points, after backing Barack Obama by 12, but the populist Cartwright won a new term last year by 10 points.\n\n2020\n\nMark Sanford. He extended his timeline for a decision on whether to run for president, citing the need for his home state to prepare for hurricane damage. \"As governor he dealt with many storm preparations, and given the gravity of this storm, he encourages residents along the East Coast to pay heed to the warnings and declarations of state and county emergency operation teams,\" his spokeswoman Sarah Allred said Monday.\n\nElizabeth Warren. She scrapped a trip to South Carolina because of the hurricane; she had intended to hold a town hall in Orangeburg with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the House sponsor of her student debt-relief bill.\n\nCory Booker. He released his own Climate and Environmental Justice Plan ahead of tomorrow's CNN climate town halls, with its own moonshot budget and annual goals: $3 trillion in renewable energy over 10 years and a carbon-neutral economy by the year 2045.\n\nBernie Sanders. His sit-down with Ady Barkan, the health justice activist with ALS, was the first to be published; in it, Sanders speaks more openly than usual about fatherhood and his relationship with his family, before arguing that Medicare-for-all can be passed via a grass-roots pressure campaign.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro. He released his pre-town hall climate plan, People & Planet First, which calls for $10 trillion in renewable investment and transition funds and net zero emissions by 2045, with a 50 percent cut in emissions by 2030.\n\nMarianne Williamson.

Elizabeth Warren speaks at a campaign house party in Hampton Falls, N.H., on Monday. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nThe Warren/Sanders cold war. Bernie Sanders refuses to attack Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren refuses to attack Bernie Sanders. \u201cWe've been friends forever,\u201d she repeated, for the umpteenth time, to reporters with her on Labor Day in New Hampshire.\n\nBut we're nine days out from the first debate that will put Sanders, Warren and Joe Biden on the same stage, and the attacks on Warren are already being beta-tested. The ones to watch:\n\n\n\nWarren the hawk. After 2016, Warren joined the Senate Armed Services Committee; from there, she supported the 2018 defense budget, which Sanders voted against. (Both candidates voted against the 2019 budget.) That's one in a series of Warren decisions that have put her closer to the Democrats' interventionist mainstream than Sanders (I-Vt.), who worked after his 2016 run to hone his critique of military adventurism and America's approach toward Venezuela and Israel. Sanders supporters confidently argue that their candidate would break from the Washington consensus on foreign policy but Warren, like Barack Obama, would continue it; see the semi-viral video that mashes up Warren's goofy, feather-boa'd jog around a gay pride parade with images of violence in the Middle East.\n\nWarren the Medicare-for-all scab. With Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris amending their Medicare-for-all endorsements to say they'd prefer to phase in single-payer health care more slowly, Warren is the only 2020 Democrat who hasn't muddled her support for Sanders's bill. Of the 10 Democrats who will be onstage next week, only Warren and Sanders have endorsed the eventual abolition of the for-profit insurance industry. But Warren often skips past the term \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d and there's a constant lookout for evidence that she's buckling.\n\nA Sept. 1 tweet from Warren, which linked to a video of her telling an Asian American news network that she wants the government to make generic drugs (\"if the market isn't working, then the government should manufacture it\"), described her approach as \u201cimproving access to health care.\u201d Since \u201caccess\u201d is often used by Medicare-for-all opponents, that was a red flag to Warren critics; the replies to that tweet largely consist of people saying she has revealed that she won't change the health-care system.\n\nWarren the Republican. It's part of the senator's origin story: She never intended to run for office and would have been happy in academia. Part of that story, well told since her political career began eight years ago, is that she was a Republican voter until 1996, when she was 47 years old. (Ronald Reagan, the most famous party-switcher to win the presidency until Donald Trump, was 51 when he abandoned the Democrats.)\n\nWarren rarely gets into detail about her Republican years. Friends have described her as personally conservative; asked about which votes she cast, she said she supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan and Michael Dukakis over George H.W. Bush. But Warrenworld increasingly expects her opponents to ask how she could have stayed inside the party during the Reagan era, when Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were, respectively, leading a resistance in the Senate and attacking the president's foreign and domestic policy from Burlington. An offhand comment from Susan Sarandon at a Sanders event (\u201cHe's not someone who used to be a Republican\u201d) resounded in Democratic circles.\n\nMost of the could-be hits on Warren would come from further to her left. The party loyalty attack could come from anywhere.\n\nCOUNTDOWN\n\n\u2026 one day until CNN's climate town halls\n\n\u2026 seven days until the special election in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District\n\n\u2026 nine days until the third Democratic debates", "description": "In this edition: Mississippi's curiously close race for governor, Democrats learn to hate golf again, and the coming attacks on Elizabeth Warren.", "authors": ["David Weigel", "National Reporter Covering Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/5cde71edee29def8bf43330d4cd68b50-4032-3024-70-8-msgovweigel_tstmp_1567543552.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517"}
