He condemned the lack of practical actions by the United States and South Korea for better bilateral relations.\n\n\"Now the United States and the South Korean authorities, instead of responding to our goodwill gestures, are talking about better relations and dialogues in the international arena, but they are introducing a large number of new strike weapons behind our backs, conducting joint military exercises and thus annoying our country, their negotiating partner,\" he said.", "description": "Speaker for the lower house of the Russian parliament and chairman of the legislature body of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) condemned the policy of sanctions and trade wars pursued by the United States, an official Russian statement said Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/23/5dafc4a6a310cf3e97a29252.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
