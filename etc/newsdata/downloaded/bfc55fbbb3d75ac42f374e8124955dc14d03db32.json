(AP) - When Cam Newton left the shotgun and began creeping toward the line of scrimmage, Buccaneers cornerback Vernon Hargreaves knew exactly what was coming.\n\nThe Bucs sniffed out a fourth-and-1 play from the 2-yard line with Hargreaves shoving Christian McCaffrey out of bounds with 1:22 left to preserve a 20-14 win over the Carolina Panthers and cap off a terrific defensive performance on Thursday night.\n\nJameis Winston threw for 208 yards and a touchdown, Chris Godwin had 121 yards receiving and a score and Peyton Barber ran for 82 yards, but it was the Bucs defense that won this game. Tampa Bay held the Panthers without a touchdown and limited McCaffrey to 53 total yards to give coach Bruce Arians his first victory with the team.\n\nThe goal-line stand, particularly the fourth down play, was just the icing on the cake.\n\nAs Newton cleared out of the way, McCaffrey took the direct snap from center, faked a reverse to Curtis Samuel and raced around left end but couldn\u2019t find the edge. He tried to extend the ball, but didn\u2019t pick up the first down as Hargreaves rode him out of bounds.\n\n\u201cYou watch any football and you\u2019ve seen it a few times,\u201d Hargreaves said of the play. \u201cOnce I saw Cam walk up to the line of scrimmage and act like he was talking to me I had a pretty good idea what was going on.\u201d\n\nIt would be hard to imagine the Panthers taking the ball out of their 6-foot-5, 245-pound quarterback\u2019s hands in the past. Even Hargreaves said a few years ago, Newton \u201cdefinitely, 100 percent\u201d would have tried to run and score.\n\nBut this is a different time for the ninth-year quarterback. Although he has more TDs rushing than any other QB in the league, he has just minus-2 yards on five carries this season with two fumbles .\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t take them hits like that,\u201d Hargreaves said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to eat his body up. So not really. We expected more throwing as he is getting older in his career.\u201d\n\nPanthers coach Ron Rivera said there is nothing wrong with Newton\u2019s shoulder or foot that prevented him from running the ball. He believed the Panthers had the right play called.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can tell. We felt good about the play.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey said it was his job to get into the end zone - or at least pick up the first down - and he failed.\n\n\u201cThe ball is in my hands and I have to make that play,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cI have to get better.\u201d\n\nActually the entire Panthers offense needs to get better, Newton said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to look defensive guys in the eyes after a game like this because we didn\u2019t uphold our end of the bargain,\u201d Newton said. \u201cAll fingers are pointed back to the offense and me specifically.\u201d\n\nNewton finished with 324 yards passing , but was held without a touchdown for the second straight week.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) got plenty of pressure on Newton with three sacks coming from Shaquil Barrett. The Panthers failed to reach the end zone, only scoring on Joey Slye\u2019s four field goals and a safety by Luke Kuechly . They are 0-2 for the first time since the 2013 season.\n\nNewton said it\u2019s embarrassing being booed off the field on some third downs. He said you can\u2019t blame the fans and \u201cthey deserve better.\u201d\n\nWINSTON AVOIDS TURNOVERS\n\nAfter throwing two pick 6\u2019s last week, Winston played a turnover-free game.\n\nAnd with the defense playing well, that was good enough.\n\n\u201cI thought he was outstanding,\u201d Arians said. \u201cHe had a hell of a week as far as mentally preparing and getting ready for this ball game. I think that\u2019s the type of game he can play.\u201d\n\nNEWTON THROWS DEEP\n\nAfter fielding plenty of questions about only attempting only one pass of more than 20 yards downfield in the season opener against the Rams, Newton connected on a 44-yard strike to Curtis Samuel late in the first quarter. It was one of handful of deep balls the quarterback threw.\n\nJEERS TO CHEERS\n\nAfter fumbling his first two punt return attempts, Ray-Ray McCloud was greeted with sarcastically cheers as he fielded his third punt cleanly. But the jeers quickly turned to cheers when McCloud raced up the middle of the field for a 39-yard return.\n\nSLYE GUY\n\nUndrafted rookie Joey Slye made all four field goals, including a 54-yarder and is now 6 of 7 on the season in place of the injured Graham Gano.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBuccaneers: Linebacker Devin White left the game in the first quarter with a knee injury and cornerback Jamel Dean suffered a lower leg injury in the third. Neither player returned to the game. Kevin Minter, who replaced White, was given the game ball after finishing with eight tackles.\n\nPanthers: None reported.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBuccaneers: Host New York Giants on Sept. 22.\n\nPanthers: At Arizona on Sept. 22.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Cam Newton left the shotgun and began creeping toward the line of scrimmage, Buccaneers cornerback Vernon Hargreaves knew exactly what was coming.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/buccaneers_panthers_football_33515_c0-142-3389-2117_s1770x1032.jpg?f867db28953b03298f98c3c4ba185a4b690ed2bd", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
