Larry Hogan (R) is ramping up his opposition to the plan\u2019s anticipated cost \u2014 part of the reason so many people felt it was necessary to flood Dorothy I. Height Elementary and demand that the recommended amount of money come through for the city\u2019s historically underfunded schools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEducation officials went over the details of the commission\u2019s recommendations and rallied families to fight for them during next year\u2019s General Assembly session, when legislators are expected to take more action. The group brought a pep rally\u2019s energy to a discussion on complex funding mechanisms and policy changes.\n\n\u201cThere are forces out there that don\u2019t want to see the commission recommendations implemented,\u201d said William E. \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, chairman of what is officially called the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. \u201cOver the next six months, we are going to be in a battle for the soul of Maryland. What kind of state do we want to be?\u201d\n\nAliyah Abid, a 17-year-old Baltimore City College senior, knows her answer: She wants to live in a state where \u201cthe amount of wealth surrounding you doesn\u2019t affect the quality of education you\u2019re able to receive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there will be challenges.\n\nWhile Marylanders overwhelmingly say they are willing to pay more in taxes to improve public education, according to a new Goucher College poll, more than three-quarters of them know nothing about the work of the Kirwan Commission.\n\nAs people entered the auditorium, they were handed a packet with a Kirwan Commission fact sheet and another aiming to bust myths about group\u2019s work.\n\nOne idea it challenged? \u201cThe Kirwan Commission funding formula is too expensive to fund.\u201d\n\nBy 2030, the funding formulas would require the state government to spend $2.8 billion more on schools and mandate $1.2 billion more from local governments for their county school systems, for a total boost of $4 billion annually. Baltimore alone would need to spend $330 million more on public schools, a number some leaders say will be challenging for a city with high levels of poverty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHogan has said implementing the recommendations would require significant tax increases, and he\u2019s nicknamed the commission the Kirwan Tax Hike Commission. Other elected officials also have expressed concern about how they will come up with the money that\u2019s called for in the proposal.\n\n\u201cThe teachers union can hold all the pep rallies they want, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that there is still no clear plan whatsoever for how either the state or the counties will pay this massive price tag,\u201d Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci said in a statement. \u201cMarylanders deserve more accountability and better outcomes, not pie-in-the-sky unfunded spending proposals.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders dispute this characterization.\n\nAD\n\nEconomic growth will cover some of the costs, according to Del. Maggie McIntosh, the Baltimore Democrat who is chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee and a member of the Kirwan commission.\n\nAD\n\nLegislators are considering other revenue streams, too, such as legalizing marijuana and sports betting, eliminating some existing tax credits and expanding a tax on online sales from out-of-state companies.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Democratic senators decided unanimously in their caucus to recommend that Baltimore Sen. Bill Ferguson take over the gavel from longtime Maryland Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller. As Senate president, Ferguson, a former teacher who also was a commission member, will have a massive role in ensuring Kirwan\u2019s passage. The Dorothy I. Height crowd cheered every time his name came up in discussions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make this generational moment real,\u201d said Ferguson, who raced from Annapolis to make it for the end of the meeting.\n\nAt the heart of Thursday\u2019s event was a call to action, a plea to knock on doors, write letters and show up in Annapolis until the Kirwan proposals are fully funded.\n\n\u201cWe need you to continue to raise your voices,\u201d city schools CEO Sonja Santelises told the crowd in a recorded video message. \u201cDo not let up until we win for every one of our young people. I\u2019m counting on you to be relentless.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun\n\nAD", "description": "Gov.
