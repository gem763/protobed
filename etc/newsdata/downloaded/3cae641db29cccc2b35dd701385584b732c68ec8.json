King Princess - If You Think It's Love\n\nKing Princess released her full-length album, Cheap Queen, last week and one of our favourite songs in the critically acclaimed body of work is titled If You Think It's Love.\n\nIt's a sparse reflection on modern romance, and its eclectic composition really highlights the young singer/songwriter's incredible talent.\n\n2. Nasty C \u2013 Uno (Cemix)\n\nNasty C is one of the best rappers in South Africa, and whenever he releases something new, we can't wait to press play. On one of his latest releases the local lyricist admits his admiration for music trends but reiterates hip hop is his number one.\n\nHe raps: \"I like Kwaito and Amapiano, but I can never turn hip hop to a side...\"\n\nThis song is definitely one to get the party started!\n\n3. JP Saxe - If The World Was Ending featuring Julia Michaels\n\nThis melodic new track reflects on the end of a relationship. If you haven't been there yet, it can feel like the end of the world, and for the music video, the two artists are taking it quite literally.\n\nOne of the editors here at Channe24 described it as: \"A beautiful song about two people that are meant to be together but can't be.\"\n\n4. Selena Gomez - Look at Her Now\n\nSelena Gomez has released new solo music for the first time in years and the two songs \u2013 Look at Her Now and Lose You to Love Me \u2013 are about bouncing back after heartbreak and self-affirmation.\n\nInterestingly, both songs' music videos were filmed on iPhones and have garnered the A-Lister praise in some circles.\n\nOf course, last week's double release came with its own share of negative gossip headlines, but that was always to be expected. As the saying goes: \"Haters gonna hate.\"\n\n5. PJ Powers, Skiv & Cash - I Got Faith\n\nPJ Powers - affectionately known as Thandeka - has consistently topped charts and sold-out shows in SA from the word go when she released early hits which still remain popular such as Jabulani, Feel So Strong with Steve Kekaha (banned during Apartheid), and You're So Good To Me.\n\nNow she's back with a new collaboration with Skiv & Cash, the song is titled I Got Faith, and it's the upbeat anthem that radio needs right now.\n\n6. Tame Impala - It Might Be Time\n\nOur freshest entry on this list comes from Tame Impala who have announced that their next studio album will be titled The Slow Rush. The highly-anticipated follow-up to 2015's Currents will arrive on 14 February 2020.\n\nAhead of the forthcoming album, to whet fans' appetites, the band have released a brand-new song called It Might Be Time.\n\nWhile Pitchfork said the song \"feels like nothing new\" in a not-so-glowing review, a lot of other listeners have enjoyed its nostalgic sound.\n\n7. Sam Fender - The Borders\n\nSam Fender is one of the most creative and exciting artists making waves right now. His new video is for The Borders, which is the latest track to be taken from his acclaimed debut album Hypersonic Missiles.\n\nThe song is Sam's favourite from his album and in the heart-breaking video \u2013 which was directed by Thomas James \u2013 two childhood friends go their separate ways.
