Jim Himes, D-Conn., said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that the House Intelligence Committee has \"not heard from a second\" whistleblower, adding that \"people around the president, professionals who are in the Oval Office, who are in the situation room, are watching what is happening and finally saying, 'My God, this cannot happen anymore.' \"\n\nThe seven-page whistleblower complaint released to the public Sept. 26 had helped spark an impeachment inquiry by revealing that Trump had pressured Zelensky to open an investigation into his political rival former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nThe complaint also said White House officials had tried to \"lock down\" details of the call.\n\nRepublicans had criticized the first whistleblower for not having firsthand knowledge of the call, though the intelligence community inspector general had found the complaint credible, and other information consistent with the complaint was publicly reported.\n\nTrump has railed against the whistleblower as having the \"facts wrong about the phone call\" and tweeted on Saturday evening in response to a New York Times report Friday about a second whistleblower coming forward.\n\nIt is unclear if the whistleblower represented by Zaid is the same person.\n\n\"The first so-called second hand information \u201cWhistleblower\u201d got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another 'Whistleblower' is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming,\" Trump wrote.\n\nZaid later tweeted what appeared to be a response to those who had criticized the first whistleblower for not having firsthand information.\n\nAccording to Zaid, the second whistleblower had firsthand possession of \"certain info,\" but \"there is NO legal requirement for any (whistleblower) to have such knowledge. Law only requires a \"'reasonable belief.'\"\n\nRep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, when asked on \"Fox News Sunday\" about a second whistleblower related to the Trump's call with Zelensky, said, \"It does not matter.\"\n\n\"This person is going to come forward and say, 'Yep, the president had this phone call,' \" Stewart said. \"And yep, we have this transcript. Why should I care at all?\"", "description": "A second whistleblower \"in connection to\"\u00a0the call between Trump and Zelensky, will be coming forward, according to that person's attorney.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/05/USAT/54c64b8e-47dc-4bd5-9574-9fd2ea65c121-AP_Trump_4.JPG?crop=2839,1597,x852,y84&width=2724&height=1597&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
