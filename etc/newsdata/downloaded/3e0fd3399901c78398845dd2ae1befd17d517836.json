Victoria Beckham\u2019s show was being held in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, so there was a queue snaking down King Charles Street in Westminster while ID cards were checked, bags were scanned and the audience lolled in the sunshine. On the other side of the road, the fashion queue was mirrored by an orderly lineup of climate crisis activists \u2013 many dressed not dissimilarly from the fashion crowd, with a lean toward asymmetric clothing and unusual sunglasses \u2013 holding placards reading \u201cThe Ugly Truth About Fashion\u201d and \u201cBusiness As Usual Is Killing The Planet\u201d.\n\nSara Arnold, an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson, talked eloquently about the need to \u201cwake people up to their power as citizens, not consumers\u201d. A fashion photographer, perhaps misjudging the mood, began to heckle her, only to be shushed by the very showgoers who the protesters were facing off against. \u201cIf we realise and act now, we have the power to change our course,\u201d Arnold continued. The fashion industry audience listened politely, until all the Saint Laurent and Gucci handbags had been through the scanner and we could file into the show space, where a view of David Beckham and Dame Helen Mirren displaced from our minds any thought of the imminent demise of the human race.\n\nWelcome to Late Stage Capitalism: The Musical \u2013 the show formerly known as fashion week. Fashion week has never just been about fashion. It is a microcosm of everything that is compelling and seductive about modern life, and of everything that is terrifying about modern life as well. The gaudy consumerism that makes fashion week an increasingly queasy spectacle isn\u2019t just about handbags: it\u2019s about the processed food we eat, the packaging we use, the trips we make by car and plane. Fashion week is an all-singing, all-dancing, jazz-hands live-action hot take on how we live.\n\nFashion has been the golden child of popular culture for two decades. From Sex and the City to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s politically charged wardrobe in the Formation video, from the Oscar red carpet to Chanel\u2019s Superbowl-sized catwalk shows, fashion has broadcast to the whole world. Fashion weeks in Lagos and Copenhagen as well as London, New York, Milan and Paris have fed on the intravenous energy of their cities, becoming a modern version of the royal box at the opera house: the place to see and be seen as both powerful and glamorous. (We have a word for that, in fashion. It\u2019s called being fabulous.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Retro chic: models dancing at the 16Arlington show, SS20, London Fashion Week, Photograph: Jeff Spicer/BFC/Getty Images\n\nFashion\u2019s lure to celebrity extends way beyond the ranks of reality TV stars. Last Thursday, the day London fashion week began, I was at a lunchtime event with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and then spent the evening down-table from Theresa May at a women\u2019s-only dinner thrown by the designer Anya Hindmarch. If fashion is the new opium of the masses, fashion week is the A-list\u2019s guilty pleasure.\n\nBut the climate crisis has set fashion on a collision course with the zeitgeist. This is both a practical and a philosophical problem for fashion. Practical, first, because of the ever-increasing production of new clothes and the churn of landfill this leaves in its wake. But philosophical, too, because fashion has to be about looking ahead. If fashion doesn\u2019t engage with the future, it literally isn\u2019t fashion.\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis is this generation\u2019s war, and wars change everything,\u201d said Hindmarch at dinner on Thursday. There is a new seriousness to the mood music in fashion. Alpha front-row reading now means Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes by Dana Thomas, or The Testaments. (The most-Instagrammed bag of show week was a tote bag printed with the cover of the new Atwood novel. If you can\u2019t track that down, there\u2019s a Guardian x Katharine Hamnett tote in partnership with Friends of the Earth, on sale Thursday.) If you are reading a magazine, make it the new issue of Teen Vogue with Greta Thunberg on the cover.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Preen by Thornton Bregazzi show, SS20, London fashion week.

Deadstock \u2013 unsold clothes from past seasons \u2013 is a buzzword all of a sudden. Backstage after the Preen show on Sunday morning, the designer Justin Thornton told me that some pieces in the collection would be made in limited runs, as they were being produced \u201cout of deadstock we had in the studio from old seasons, that we wanted to reuse rather than buying new fabric\u201d. Ganni, the cult Danish label that opened its first London store this week, regularly makes capsule collections out of old-season stock. Roland Mouret, who is on a mission against the wastefulness of single-use clothes hangers \u2013 \u201cthe plastic straws of the fashion industry\u201d \u2013 also featured upcycled baseball caps by the Berlin milliners ReHats.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Upcycled baseball caps at the Roland Mouret show, SS20, London Fashion Week.

Curated edits of pre-loved clothes are emerging as a model to bring hanger-appeal and contemporary relevance to secondhand clothes. At its most upscale, this can mean vintage Paris fashion hand-picked by Marie Blanchet at William Vintage. But it can also be rented designer pieces from MyWardrobe.com, from where you can borrow a Gucci handbag or a Burberry trenchcoat, boosting your wardrobe and the circular economy at the same time. Also on the rise is peer-to-peer rental on Hurr Collective, where a week\u2019s rental of a new designer piece is usually around 15% of the retail price.\n\nIt has become fashionable to predict that the future of fashion is the end of trends, but I\u2019m not convinced. Watching models in white sunglasses and silk headscarves dance in feathered minidresses and foxy tailoring by the British luxury brand 16Arlington at its show this weekend, where the collection was inspired by the glamour of 1960s Italy, reminded me how evocative and desirable a retro look can be. These clothes were newly made, but a vintage-oriented fashion mindset could take such a show as a jumping-off point to fall back in love with old pieces in a wardrobe, an attic, or a secondhand store. With the future not looking all that pretty, nostalgia could be a rising stock. Fashion isn\u2019t going away any time soon. But to keep pace with the zeitgeist, it needs to smarten up its act.", "description": "The trends at Britain\u2019s biggest fashion event?
