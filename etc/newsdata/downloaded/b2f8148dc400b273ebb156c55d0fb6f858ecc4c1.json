IBM\u2019s current Q System One machine has 20 qubits.\n\n\u201cThis effort is poised to be a major catalyst for Europe\u2019s innovation landscape and research capabilities,\u201d said Martin Jetter, senior vice president and chairman of IBM Europe.\n\nThe quantum computer - the first to be deployed by IBM outside the United States - will be shipped to Germany and set up next year. In the meantime, German researchers will gain access to IBM\u2019s U.S.-based Q Network research forum.\n\nBuilding a research community around the project has the potential to create \u201ca unique concentration of skills\u201d, Jetter told Reuters, drawing parallels to the origins of Silicon Valley in the United States.\n\nSUPERCOOLED COMPUTING\n\nDeveloping viable quantum computers has proved to be hugely challenging because they rely on superconductivity that can only be achieved in temperatures close to absolute zero.\n\nAny instability in the qubits, for example from vibrations, can lead to \u201cnoise\u201d that causes calculation errors and undermines a quantum computer\u2019s power to solve problems.\n\nThe Q System One, launched in January, has been deployed primarily in a research setting but IBM - which has branched into cloud computing and artificial intelligence in recent years - hopes to turn it into a commercial proposition.\n\nResearchers will be able to access the quantum computer via the IBM cloud, with potential tasks ranging from mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to making artificial intelligence more powerful.\n\nAnother application is financial risk and portfolio analysis, as the equations that run on quantum computers resemble economic systems, said Torsten Uwe Siebert, manager of the Quantum Technology Program at the Fraunhofer Society.\n\nMerkel\u2019s government last year said it would make available 3 billion euros to sponsor the research and development of artificial intelligence by 2025 as it seeks to regain ground in cutting-edge research.", "description": "IBM is joining forces with a German research institute to explore the potential of quantum computing, backed by a government plan to invest 650 million euros ($717 million) over two years in wider research in the field.", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428365768&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891FW", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
