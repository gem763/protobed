Lakers fun and games\n\nSo the Los Angeles Lakers, eventually, are going to be great. LeBron James and Anthony Davis will make their slow crawl to playing the four and five, respectively. Kyle Kuzma will return. The spacing will sort itself out. But in the early days, every Lakers loss is going to engender mass hysteria (or schadenfreude) on NBA Twitter. On that note, here\u2019s your Lakers Twitter Bingo card for every time they lose, with reactions, justifications, overreactions, concern, trolling, and my personal favorite: concern trolling.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n(Yahoo Sports illustration)\n\n2. In support of the coach\u2019s challenge\n\nDuring the Bucks\u2019 matchup against the host Rockets on Thursday night, fans got one of their first tastes of the coach\u2019s challenge, a new rule allowing coaches to challenge one referee call per game. If the call isn\u2019t overturned, the coach is charged one timeout, a measure I assume exists to deter game stoppage for the sake of 50-50 calls.\n\nAnd let me tell you, it really extinguishes some of the worst experiences of watching a basketball game. In the first quarter, Giannis Antetokounmpo plowed into P.J. Tucker, who was established in the paint for multiple seconds, yet the referee still called a block. The call \u2014 viewed on-screen \u2014 was so obviously wrong that it elicited mass outrage from fans, from the Rockets\u2019 bench and from this viewer\u2019s couch. It was a minor injustice, but I realized the call-and-response was similar to seeing something patently wrong happening. I rolled my eyes, felt my blood curdling. I was itching to tweet.\n\n(Yahoo Sports illustration)\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd, then, voila: coach Mike D\u2019Antoni challenged the call, providing the perfect release valve for the consternation of 20,000 people in the building. It should also work to reduce the tension between players and referees by giving teams a psychological sense of control over their livelihoods and referees cover in the face of bad calls that could only be determined as such on camera.\n\n3. Giannis can\u2019t escape his own free-agency hype\n\nOn Thursday, 2021 free agent Giannis Antetokounmpo denied telling a Harvard Business Review researcher this: \u201cI want the Bucks to build a winning culture. So far, we have been doing great, and, if this lasts, there's no other place I want to be. But if we're underperforming in the NBA next year, deciding whether to sign becomes a lot more difficult.\u201d\n\nPer Matt Velazquez of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"As I said, the last \u2026 What is it called? Quote? Paragraph? It\u2019s words that I didn\u2019t use,\" he said. \"Underperforming or whether or deciding, all those words I\u2019ve never used in my life. As I said, I\u2019m not going to talk about it. There are going to be stories that come out \u2014 I said that, I said this \u2014 but I\u2019m not going to get into it at all.\"\n\nI tend to think that, over the course of an in-depth conversation, he said it. I also think he might not remember saying it.\n\nA: Why lie?\n\nB: The sentiment wasn\u2019t all that different from Antetokounmpo\u2019s general free-agency stance: winning is the most important thing to him. It was just framed a little bit differently.\n\nWhich leads us to the problem: It\u2019s become nearly impossible for free agent\u2019s to handle free agency quietly. A fairly innocuous quote that revealed nothing new ate up multiple news cycles and was deemed sensitive enough to warrant a denial. In the modern age, you either go silent like Kawhi Leonard \u2014 an easier proposition for someone who is predisposed to that kind of behavior \u2014 or brace for the storm. Antetokounmpo has vowed he won\u2019t let his impending decision be a distraction. The events of the past few days have illustrated just how hard that\u2019ll be.\n\n4. Buddy Hield, saying it out loud\n\nNobody wants to feel bad for millionaires. Especially athlete millionaires. Which is why Buddy Hield, who signed an extension this week, was ripped to shreds after getting candid with the media about the psychological toll of his contract negotiation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if things are going to get done,\u201d Hield said. \u201cIf it don\u2019t get done, me and my team will look for something else \u2014 probably another home. Until then, we\u2019ll see if they really want me here. That\u2019s the goal: to be here. I love Sacramento, but if they don\u2019t want me here, if they don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m part of the core \u2026 I want to be here. If they don\u2019t want me here, [I\u2019ll] find somewhere else to be.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: the NBA is a league defined by stars who consider $90 million an \u201cinsult.\u201d Hield just said it out loud. We\u2019ve all heard it, but we like to ignore it: money doesn\u2019t buy happiness. Mostly because money, when we\u2019re talking in the millions, isn\u2019t really about money. Getting paid is about feeling wanted, which is why contract negations can be so tricky and why hardball can permanently dissolve relationships. The message: You want me, sure, but not enough to lock me up here and now, and not as bad as you want to lock up some other guy on the team. Forget hardball. The course of regular negotiations can register as a dismissal and bruise egos.\n\nThese are the ugly truths that players don\u2019t tell because nobody really has ears for them, but the situation the Kings just got out of with Hield is instructive of what often turns good locker rooms bad.\n\nMost NBA teams are composed of two kinds of players. There are first-contract players, singing \u201cKumbaya\u201d and in love with their teammates, and then there are second- and third-contract players. The challenge of rebuilding through the draft is transitioning from the first contract to the second without becoming fractured along the way.\n\n5. Basketball is very good\n\nIt turns out The Ringer was onto something. And it just bears repeating: The hype is real. The stars are perfectly balanced. There is a show every night. We got Kawhi Leonard vs. LeBron James on opening night. Wednesday night\u2019s 11-game sensory overload featured a 50-piece from Kyrie Irving, the return of Luka Doncic and two playoff rematches that went down to the wire. On Thursday, there were only three games, yet four former MVPs played: Steph Curry, Giannis, James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Oh, and Kawhi Leonard, the league\u2019s best player. Everyday \u2014 hell, almost every game \u2014 is star-studded. There\u2019s never been less fluff in the schedule.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Every Lakers loss is sure to bring out the overreactions, so why not track them with a little bingo fun?", "authors": ["Seerat Sohi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e4qEIThkN6qjfJ_IFNa.xA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02ODkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uU4C02adWGSvpPyzikBKkQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MzM0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c4db1110-f756-11e9-95de-5bd04a85a326", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
