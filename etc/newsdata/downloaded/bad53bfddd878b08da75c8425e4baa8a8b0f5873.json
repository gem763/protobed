The policy may also begin to impact and reduce other tobacco-related outcomes, such as initiation on flavored tobacco, as exposure to flavored tobacco among young people continues to decline.'\n\nIt comes on the heels of a federal investigation into a slew of vaping-related illnesses, which health officials say affected teens and young people the most because flavored e-cigarettes were marketed towards them.\n\nNearly 1,500 people had developed EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung illness) and 33 people have died in 24 states, according to the CDC.\n\nMost of the victims are under the age of 35 and the youngest was just 13 years old.\n\nAbout 78 percent of people who've fallen ill have reported using products that contain THC, the main psychoactive component in marijuana.\n\nAmid pressure, e-cigarette company JUUL announced it will no longer sell flavored pods like creme brulee, cucumber, mango, mint and fruit anywhere.\n\nLast month, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker issued a four-month temporary ban on all vaping products.\n\nSuffolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled on Monday that Baker should reissue the ban as an emergency regulation, reported WBUR.\n\nThis would require a statement on the full impact to small businesses and a public hearing. It would also end the ban on Christmas Eve, one month earlier than the Baker ban.", "description": "A new study from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found when the town of Lowell ban flavored tobacco products, it reduced availability and the number of teen users.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/22/19262842-0-image-a-41_1571866814155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
