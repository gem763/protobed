But it did not mention uprating the pupil premium.\n\nSpeaking from the Labour Party conference, the shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \u201cBoris Johnson has twice stood on an election pledge to protect the pupil premium, yet this research shows there is now a \u00a3200m black hole in real-terms funding.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing about this cut is that it hits hardest those children who most need extra help and the schools that serve them.\u201d\n\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cThe pupil premium has not been cut. The amount spent on the pupil premium to help disadvantaged pupils has more than trebled from \u00a3705m to almost \u00a32.4bn since 2011-12.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely normal for allocations to schools each year to fluctuate as the number of eligible children changes.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cThis government has also announced a \u00a314bn investment in schools over three years \u2013 the biggest cash boost for a decade.\u201d", "description": "Funding for the poorest children in England\u2019s schools has been cut by more than \u00a3220m in real terms since the Conservatives came to power, analysis suggests. Pupil premium money, which is given to schools to help support the most disadvantaged pupils, will have declined by 8.4 per cent in real terms by 2020, figures shared with The Independent show.", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/18/primary-school.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
