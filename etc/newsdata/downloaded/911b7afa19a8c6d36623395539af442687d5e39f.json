A cloud refers to networks comprised of hyper-scale data centers built using open-source software and commodity hardware.\n\nWith the demand for cloud-based solutions only growing, enterprises are turning to software companies to provide the digital infrastructure they need to keep pace with a world that\u2019s increasingly online.\n\nBut how are investors supposed to know which stocks are poised to soar beyond the clouds? One way to find these stocks is by using the TipRanks Stock Screener. The Stock Screener lets you sort stocks by sector and analyst consensus to pinpoint the most compelling investments.\n\nUsing this tool, we were able to find 3 cloud-based software stocks that have garnered substantial support from Wall Street with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d analyst consensus. This is based on the last three months\u2019 worth of ratings from all other analysts.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nAs the pioneer behind customer relationship management (CRM) software, Salesforce has cemented its status as one of the leading players in the space.\n\nBased on its solid performance in its most recent quarter, investors are liking what they\u2019re seeing. On August 22, the company posted a second quarter earnings and revenue beat driven by the strength of its Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. Sales cloud, the company\u2019s largest product, generated $1.13 billion in revenue while the Service Cloud reached $1.09 billion, up 13% and 22%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThat being said, CRM has been branching out as part of a larger effort to diversify its product offerings.\n\nBack in 2018, CRM acquired Mulesoft\u2019s software business for $6.5 billion. The deal allowed CRM to offer solutions using data stored in disparate systems, some in the cloud and some in legacy on-premises software.\n\nThis was followed up by an even larger acquisition of data visualization company Tableau. At $15.3 billion, the purchase was the company\u2019s largest acquisition in its history.\n\nWhile some investors originally expressed concern that CRM was biting off more than it can chew with the acquisition, RBC Capital analyst Alex Zukin believes the current valuation of 5.5 times enterprise value to expected 2021 revenue represents a unique opportunity. \u201cWe see little meaningful competition and no evidence of pricing pressure or market saturation at Salesforce,\u201d the five-star analyst explained. As a result, he assumed coverage with a Buy while raising the price target from $181 to $200 on August 23. He believes shares could surge 32% in the next twelve months.\n\nWall Street clearly agrees as CRM has received 26 Buy ratings and no Holds or Sells in the last three months, giving it a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 analyst consensus. Its $188 average price target indicates 24% upside potential.\n\nServiceNow Inc. (NOW)\n\nWhile not as well-known as CRM, ServiceNow has been deemed a must-watch name in the workplace software space. Its cloud-based solutions get rid of paperwork by enabling its customers to digitize manual business processes that have typically needed to be performed on paper. With shares already up 48% year-to-date, it\u2019s easy to see why analysts are excited about this cloud stock.\n\nStory continues", "description": "As more and more businesses go digital, cloud-based software providers stand to reap the benefits.
