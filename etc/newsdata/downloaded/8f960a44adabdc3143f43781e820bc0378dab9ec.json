For example, in 2016, they elected a man named Donald Trump. He is still the president. Go suck an egg if you don\u2019t like it.\n\nIt also means that American voters get to choose where our soldiers, sailors and airmen get deployed around the world. They choose that by electing \u201crepresentatives\u201d to Congress, who vote to declare wars. They also get to choose the commander in chief of America\u2019s mighty military. (Again, see previous paragraph about a man named Donald Trump, who is still president. And feel free to go suck another egg.)\n\nIn addition, American voters get to choose \u2014 again, through the \u201crepresentatives\u201d they have elected \u2014 how much money we spend on bombs and ammunition and where we deploy them. Most important, American voters choose where all that firepower gets launched and who, exactly, gets killed by American bombs and bullets.\n\nThat is the way this is supposed to work.\n\nFor more than two years, Britain under Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill begged American President Franklin D. Roosevelt to join the fight against Nazi Germany. Roosevelt was more than sympathetic. But he understood that he could not do so unless and until the American people understood the fight, knew who the enemy was, comprehended the risk of getting involved and supported the mission.\n\nThen \u2014 and only then (with a little push from the Japanese navy) \u2014 could Roosevelt join Churchill to defeat the greatest threat to civilized world in the 20th century. And with the approval and enthusiasm of the American voter, the enemy was annihilated.\n\nThere are a lot of differences between the global threat Roosevelt defeated in Germany and the global threat Mr. Trump faces now in the Syrian civil war. But one thing remains the same: American voters are still in charge.\n\nTherein lies the great political sickness of our time. American voters of every stripe are nearly unified against U.S. involvement in these endless wars in places like Syria at the very same moment when American politicians in Washington of every stripe are nearly unified in favor of same said wars.\n\nThe disconnect between voters back home and politicians in Washington is cavernous. Mr. Trump is one of the only politicians to hear the voice of the people and obey it.\n\nOf course, these very same politicians could be brave adults about it and Congress could vote to declare war in Syria. But that might cost them an election back home.\n\nA common response around here when you suggest that Congress should vote to declare war is: \u201cDeclare war on whom?\u201d\n\nExactly! Even these people don\u2019t know whom to fight over there. Yet it is the American people (and Mr. Trump) who are so deeply immoral for wanting to get out of this insane, faraway fight.\n\nThe other explanation you hear from people around here is that we are not really at war over there. Sure, we are helping kill people and all, but we are actually on a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d mission.\n\nOK. That\u2019s probably the biggest reason to get out of Syria. All our \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d is not working.\n\n\u2981 Contact Charles Hurt at [email protected] or on Twitter @charleshurt.\n\nSign up for Charles Hurt's Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
