He dropped the F-word during a live interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. I was so surprised to hear the word in a Sunday morning interview \u2013 even on a cable news network \u2013 that I quickly noted it on Twitter.\n\nBeto just used the f-word on CNN. \u2014 Karen Townsend (@penguinponders) September 1, 2019\n\nI know that in Trump\u2019s America we are all supposed to be in acceptance of the coarsening of our language in political conversations. This is an escalation, though, for a presidential candidate to be so unwilling to self-censor, even in nationally televised interviews.\n\nFoul-mouthed candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke wears his f-bombs as a badge of pride and now you can, too. As America relaxes during a long Labor Day weekend, Beto\u2019s supporters can hang out in a t-shirt with his latest crudely worded quote. The campaign began promoting it mere hours on Twitter after Beto\u2019s appearance on CNN. The quote is repeated six times on a black t-shirt and \u201cEnd gun violence\u201d. For a smooth $30 you, too, can purchase one.\n\nNew in the store\u2026 100% of the proceeds will benefit @MomsDemand and @AMarch4OurLives. This is fucked up. We can change it. https://t.co/PFRWFCypAl pic.twitter.com/Us1V4mz1cf \u2014 Team Beto (@TeamBeto) September 1, 2019\n\nThe proceeds will be split equally between Moms Demand Action \u2013 the gun control group formed by parents after the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, and March for Our Lives \u2013 the gun control group formed after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting. Beto is all about confiscating guns and this works well for him. As has been pointed out, all of this sure is well-coordinated, as though it\u2019s part of a plan for his floundering campaign to create some headlines and buzz, even if it is on the backs of shooting victims. For a candidate known for flying by the seat of his pants, his campaign wasted no time jumping on this.\n\nThe t-shirt is safe for progressive purchasers \u2013 it is printed by a union and made in the U.S.A. just in time for Labor Day sales. Think of all the cool skateboarders sporting such woke messaging on behalf of the O\u2019Rourke campaign.\n\nT-shirt sales have been used in this political cycle to raise money but not to exploit a tragedy. The RNC, the Trump campaign, and Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign have all offered t-shirts for sale that used quotes or ideas that caused a buzz in the media.\n\nIt is not the first time a campaign has turned a viral moment into a T-shirt for sale. The National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, started selling T-shirts showing Greenland as a part of the U.S. to raise money following President Donald Trump\u2019s dispute with Denmark over a sale of Greenland. The Trump campaign sold a \u201cFredo unhinged\u201d shirt mocking CNN anchor Chris Cuomo\u2019s altercation with a man who had called him \u201cFredo.\u201d And after the first Democratic presidential debate, the Kamala Harris campaign started selling \u201cthat little girl was me\u201d T-shirts \u2013 a reference to a debate between Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden about school busing.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is known in Texas for foul language on the campaign trail. His speeches during his 2018 run against Ted Cruz for a seat in the Senate were frequently peppered with f-bombs and other language that his supporters lapped up. The rest of America now knows this is his schtick. It\u2019s his way of showing how sincere he is about issues, however misguided the delivery of his thoughts may be.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke is a foul-mouthed gun-grabbing socialist who never met a government program he didn\u2019t like. The Beto O\u2019Rourke running for president is much more authentic than the one who ran for the U.S. Senate in Texas. No wonder he has refused to drop out of the presidential race to come back to Texas and run against Senator John Cornyn in 2020.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter: @penguinponders", "description": "That's the ticket", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bo.jpg"}
