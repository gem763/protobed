Its largest spending increase was in sales and marketing, in which it spent US$367 million, a 58 per cent increase from Q1 2018. \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on the figures, but 2019 is a big investment year in support of our hosts and guests,\u201d said an Airbnb spokesperson. (The Information)\n\nTalking point: Airbnb is a private company, so it hasn\u2019t yet released detailed financial statements\u2014though it has previously said its revenue \u201csubstantially\u201d passed US$1 billion in the second quarter of this year. It\u2019s common for firms to spend more in marketing just before going public, which the company said it aims to do in 2020. The heightened losses, however, may spook investors, especially in the wake of disappointing debuts from fellow tech firms Uber and Lyft, and WeWork\u2019s abandoned IPO in September. Airbnb posted a profit of US$18.7 million last year, before interest and taxes. But it isn\u2019t yet clear whether it can bring in enough extra business from its increased spending to justify it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hanna Lee"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
