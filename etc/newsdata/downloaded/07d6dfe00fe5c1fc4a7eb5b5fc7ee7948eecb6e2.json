We have said our ambition on securing workers' rights will be stronger than the provision of the bill.\"\n\nA legal commitment\n\nEnvironmental groups have also raised concerns after the document was leaked, calling on ministers to introduce legal guarantees on current standards in the Environment Bill, which is due to be debated for the first time in the Commons on Monday.\n\nBenjamin Halfpenny from Greener UK, a coalition of groups including the RSPB, Friends of the Earth and the National Trust, said: \"The government has had plenty of opportunities to put a commitment to existing standards into law, but has thus far not done so.\n\n\"Such a commitment would not prevent future governments from going further on things like water quality and chemical safety, just stop them going backwards.\"\n\nA Brexit department spokesman said the government \"has no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights or environmental protection after we leave the EU\".\n\nHe said the UK already exceeds the minimum standards in areas such as maternity leave, shared parental leave and greenhouse gas emissions targets.", "description": "But the government says reports that employee rights could be downgraded are \"way exaggerated\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16211/production/_109414609_c0000ddc-bea5-4bb9-bc55-e99b1ddcd8fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
