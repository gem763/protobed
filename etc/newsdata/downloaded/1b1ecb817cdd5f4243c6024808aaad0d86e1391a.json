Eight police officers were injured, they said.\n\nAuthorities are eager to avoid scenes that could embarrass the central government in Beijing on the eve of the anniversary after months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Police said several major roads will be closed on Tuesday near the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where a flag-raising ceremony is scheduled to take place.\n\nAuthorities on Monday rejected a permit for a march planned for Tuesday from Victoria Park in the bustling tourist district of Causeway Bay to Chater Road, next to government headquarters, on security grounds. Demonstrations are expected across Hong Kong regardless.\n\nAdmiralty, Wan Chai, and Prince Edward metro stations will be closed, Mass Transit Railway (MTR) said on Monday. The airport-bound express train will only stop at the central Hong Kong station, and only people with air tickets will be allowed entry to the terminal.\n\nSeveral shopping malls - including Elements in Tsim Sha Tsui and Telford Plaza in Kowloon Bay - have said they will close their doors.\n\nThe airport has previously been a target of protesters. Some demonstrations in shopping malls have ended in violence.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public are reminded to remain vigilant and mind their own safety,\u201d a government spokesman said on Monday.\n\nCLEAN-UP\n\nA huge clean-up was under way on Monday after roads, shops and buildings across the financial centre were daubed in graffiti, windows in government buildings smashed and parts of pavements uprooted by protesters at the weekend.\n\nSome underground stations were vandalised and streets strewn with debris from roadblocks and the charred remains of fires.\n\nAn Indonesian journalist was hit in the eye by a rubber bullet and hospitalised on Sunday. The Indonesian Consulate confirmed that one of its citizens had been injured.

The embattled leader had sent out invitations \u201crequesting the pleasure of your company\u201d at the flag-raising ceremony and a reception in Hong Kong on Tuesday.\n\nAn anti-government protester throws a lit molotov cocktail after retreat from the clash with riot police in Hong Kong, China September 29, 2019.

The government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her at the ceremony.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping made brief mention of Hong Kong at a National Day reception in the Great Hall of the People on Monday, saying it would have a bright future.

The protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nThe weekend marked the fifth anniversary of the start of the \u201cUmbrella\u201d protests - pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 that failed to wrest concessions from Beijing.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nThe clashes began mid-afternoon on Sunday and went on into the night. Thousands of masked protesters roamed the streets, facing off against riot police amid plumes of tear gas and raging fires.\n\nPolice said an officer fired a warning shot after they were \u201csurrounded and attacked by a large group of violent protesters\u201d.\n\nBy early morning on Monday all MTR metro stations on the city\u2019s main island were open, but staff could be seen repairing damage and clearing debris.\n\nWorkers at a Starbucks store were shovelling broken glass into garbage bags and peeling anti-China posters off the walls.
