It\u2019s going to be a tough challenge.\u201d", "description": "South Africa have to shut down two high speed Japanese 'Ferraris' if they are to prevail in the World Cup quarter-final on Sunday, according to Springboks assistant coach Mzwandile Stick.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441102628&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E10S-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
