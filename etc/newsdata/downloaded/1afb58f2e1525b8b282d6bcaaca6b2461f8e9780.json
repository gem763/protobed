One stat says yes", "language": "en", "text": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Jordie Barrett\u2019s unruffled performance as a makeshift All Blacks fly-half won the praise of coach Steve Hansen \u2014 and put him one up on his big brother, two-time World Player of the Year Beauden.\n\nThe Barrett family accounts for nearly one-tenth of New Zealand\u2019s 31-man Rugby World Cup squad, with playmaker Beauden the eldest brother and the senior All Black compared to Scott, a lock, and utility back Jordie.\n\nBut Jordie, youngest of the brothers, earned bragging rights when he took a personal haul of 21 points in New Zealand\u2019s 71-9 win over Namibia \u2014 bettering Beauden\u2019s World Cup high of 16, scored against the same opposition in 2015.\n\nA try and eight-from-nine kicking in the second half \u2014 after he missed his first two conversions in the first \u2014 left the 22-year-old \u201celated\u201d, according to Hansen.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s pretty excited and happy with how he played, how he did the job that Ian (Foster, the assistant coach) and I wanted him to do, and the team needed him to do,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nJordie has a long way to go to improve on the exploits of his big brother Beauden, who scored a try in the final as New Zealand won the 2015 World Cup and was World Player of the Year two years running.\n\nWhen told he\u2019d beaten Beauden\u2019s personal haul in a World Cup game, Jordie said \u201cthat\u2019s nice to know\u201d but stressed he wasn\u2019t out to get one over on his brother.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t go there and play for. I\u2019m just happy I found my rhythm off the tee after missing the first two,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve been working at the last couple of months, my goal-kicking, so it\u2019s nice it came off.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Two days to prepare \u2013\n\nJordie\u2019s pride in his performance is understandable. He has told how he was often left in tears when the Barretts\u2019 competitive instincts took over during games on the family dairy farm in Taranaki.\n\nAfter playing on the right wing against Canada, he was drafted in at fly-half at the last minute for the Namibia game, after being given just two days to prepare.\n\nGiven he hadn\u2019t started at fly-half since university, it was an assured, all-round performance from the youngest Barrett, whose cross-field kick set up the opening try.\n\nHe stood up to a physical test from the Namibians, made a storming break to create Anton Leinert-Brown\u2019s second try and capped his afternoon by diving over for his own score five minutes from time.\n\nJordie also had to steer the defending champions through some sticky moments when they were just 10-9 up against a willing Namibia team after half-an-hour.\n\n\u201cI loved it, loved every minute even in that first 30 when we were up against it, as a good challenge for me mentally to stay in focus, be where my feet are,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed today, felt like I could grow into the game as it went on.\u201d\n\nHansen, who will step down after the World Cup, said he wasn\u2019t sure if Jordie would play fly-half again.\n\nBut the All Blacks are on alert for all eventualities after 2011, when injuries to Dan Carter, Colin Slade and Aaron Cruden handed fourth-choice Stephen Donald kicking duties in the final.\n\n\u201cWe all know he\u2019s not a first five-eighth, and I don\u2019t know how many Tests he\u2019ll play there, because after this tournament I\u2019m not going to be in charge but it\u2019s certainly not his number-one position,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cSo to be able to come out and play like he did, he should be really, really excited and fulfilled and proud.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Jordie Barrett\u2019s unruffled performance as a makeshift All Blacks fly-half won the praise of coach Steve Hansen \u2014 and put", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/1bf3ba_jordie-barrett-scored-21-points-as-makeshift-fly-new-zealand-is-all-blacks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
