In a game that saw the men in green rarely tested, the Irish delivered a composed and controlled performance to comfortably beat Russia 35-0 underneath the bright lights of the Misaki Stadium.\n\nIt was the sort of result, earning the Irish a crucial bonus point, that head coach Joe Schmidt will have been eager to see following his side\u2019s stunning defeat at the hands of Japan. Whereas Ireland had wilted under pressure in that match, here they made no such mistake, dictating the run of play from the first whistle to the last.\n\nNonetheless, there was still plenty to be desired of, with repeated handling errors and conceded turnovers, 23 in total, limiting Ireland\u2019s ability to put together the flowing, piercing rugby with which they\u2019ve terrorised opponents in the past. Against a defensively stubborn Russian side, the second-lowest ranked team here in Japan, Schmidt\u2019s men were perhaps made to work harder than they should have been.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Sexton, who captained his country for the first time, was removed at half-time and seen icing his thigh on the bench after the break. The versatile Carbery was due to cover scrum-half from the bench but never even made it that far, having picked up a possible recurrence of the ankle injury that almost kept him out of the tournament, while flanker Jordi Murphy also suffered a suspected rib problem.\n\nThe first half, at least, was clinically simple and effective in nature. A bright start saw Rob Kearney and Peter O\u2019Mahony dive over in the space of 11 minutes as Ireland set about breaking the game line with ease, before man of the match Rhys Ruddock added a third.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6.

Gareth Davies (Wales) Australia could not keep Davies out of the game in Tokyo, with the scrum-half twice intercepting Will Genia and Bernard Foley and nearly bagging himself a third in the second half.

AP\n\nFor the first, the Russians were unpicked by a sly inside ball off Tadhg Beirne, with Kearney charging into the pocket of space and driving away from a cluster of red shirts to dive over. There had been questions of a crossover with Bundee Aki, but referee Jerome Garces was happy with the passage of play as Johnny Sexton kicked the extras.\n\nThe second came off the fly-half\u2019s boot, a smart grubber kick sitting up nicely for O\u2019Mahony five or so metres out from Russia\u2019s white line, while the third was a pure distillation of Irish physicality. After softening up their opponents, the Irish forwards doing the heavy work down in the right corner, Rhys Ruddock eventually knocked down the door to make it 21-0.\n\nBut the second half made for a slightly different story. Play became stodgy and drawn out, with fumbled balls and a distinct lack of creativity creating for a dry spectacle. Even after Andrey Ostrikov had been sent to the bin \u2013 a second yellow for the Bears after Bogdan Fedotko suffered the same fate in the first half \u2013 Ireland still lacked the means to add to their earlier scores.\n\nRussia\u2019s iron wall, growing in conviction as the game wore on, certainly complicated matters. But it wasn\u2019t until the Irish returned to the tactics of the first half that the flood gates were finally reopened.\n\nJack Carty, on for Sexton, seized his opportunity on 63 minutes, dinking the ball over the top to release Keith Earls in behind. The wing was quick to make the offload to his counterpart, with Andrew Conway whizzing away to spark a late flourish for his side.\n\nGarry Ringrose added the fifth and final try, finishing off a sweeping movement down the left flank, as Ireland made sure to close out the final 10 minutes in full control.\n\nIt was, in truth, far from perfect. But after the introspection and scrutiny of the Japan defeat, this will no doubt help to steady some nerves as Schmidt\u2019s side look to wrap up qualification for the knockout stages. How such a performance will see them fare against their heavyweight rivals, though, remains to be seen.", "description": "After the humiliation of Shizuoka, a return to winning ways for Ireland.
