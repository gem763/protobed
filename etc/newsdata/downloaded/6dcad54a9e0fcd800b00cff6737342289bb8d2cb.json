The book is released in France on Thursday but English language readers will have to wait until next March for the translation.\n\nCapital in the Twenty-first Century by Thomas Piketty \u2013 review Read more\n\nAmong the proposals in the book are that employees should have 50% of the seats on company boards; that the voting power of even the largest shareholders should be capped at 10%; much higher taxes on property, rising to 90% for the largest estates; a lump sum capital allocation of \u20ac120,000 (just over \u00a3107,000) to everyone when they reach 25; and an individualised carbon tax calculated by a personalised card that would track each person\u2019s contribution to global heating.\n\nIn an interview with the French weekly news magazine L\u2019Obs, Piketty made no apologies for the impact his ideas would have on the stock market. He said: \u201c[Yes], it will also affect the price of real estate that is crazy in Paris, and it will allow new social groups to become owners and shareholders.\u201d\n\nThomas Piketty's Capital: everything you need to know about the surprise bestseller Read more\n\nCapital in the 21st Century, with its references to Jane Austen, proved to be one of the few books on economics to appeal to a mass market. It drew comparisons with John Maynard Keynes\u2019s 1936 book, the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money as its reputation spread during the period of weak growth that followed the financial crisis of a decade ago.\n\nBut Piketty\u2019s work has so far proved far more popular with readers than it has with governments. The General Theory was the template for the full-employment policies pursued by most western governments in the decades after the second world war, whereas Piketty\u2019s call for a global wealth tax to counter inequality has not been heeded.", "description": "French economist\u2019s Capital and Ideology expands on themes in Capital in the 21st Century, which sold 2m copies", "authors": ["Larry Elliott", "Thomas Piketty", "Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f29eecf112de54259ad9e33f5b953f302f6cb621/0_307_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e796e79b2124457b5528b6dd3c1f63e1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
