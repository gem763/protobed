'Frank has got players that have been on loan for one or two seasons in the Championship. The difference between my youngsters is that they are almost stepping right now onto the scene.\n\n'Axel Tuanzebe has missed the last couple of games, but he has been out on loan (at Aston Villa last season) and you can see the benefit. I think Chelsea's young players benefit from that now. They are a mature young team.'\n\nSolskjaer admits that it has been a big challenge for young players like Mason Greenwood, Tahith Chong, Angel Gomes, James Garner and Brandon Williams to step into the first-team as United have struggled at the start of the season, but he believes they will benefit from the experience.\n\nMason Mount shone on loan at Derby last season (left) and is now in Chelsea's first team\n\nTammy Abraham has continued his prolific form from Aston Villa (left) at Chelsea this season\n\nFiyako Tomori is now part of Frank Lampard's plans after an impressive spell with Derby\n\n'Character will be revealed in tough times, but I think the young kids have been excellent,' added the United boss. 'I can't give them any more responsibility and I couldn't be any more happy with many of the youngsters.\n\n'We know it's been tough, and we know that we have asked a lot of them because Paul (Pogba), Luke (Shaw), Anthony (Martial) and loads of other players have been injured. The youngsters have stepped up in a difficult period. But in the end they will be stronger for it.'\n\nAxel Tuanzebe helped Aston Villa (left) to promotion before returning to Manchester United\n\nSolskjaer admits that it has been a big challenge for his young players like Mason Greenwood\n\nAsked if Garner and Williams will face Chelsea after starting against Partizan Belgrade in Serbia last week, Solskjaer said: 'I would think so. Jimmy played 10-15 minutes (against Norwich) and was excellent. He calmed us down and made some good decisions when we wanted to see the game out. We have not made a decision on who is going to play, but you will probably see the two of them.'\n\nUnited beat Chelsea 4-0 at Old Trafford on the opening day, but Solskjaer admits that it was not a true reflection of the contest and expects another difficult game against Lampard's side who are on a run of seven straight wins.\n\nHe said: 'I think Frank has done a good job because the performance against us was good. The result was bad. We held our hands up then as well and said 4-0 was flattering.\n\n'We got pegged back and they pressed us but we scored two goals within a minute, the second and third, which decided the game for us. But we didn't think we were 4-0 better than them. It is going to be an interesting game. We don't make it easy for ourselves in the cups with the draws.'", "description": "Solskjaer and Frank Lampard have focused on youth this season - the United boss because he has chosen to recruit more heavily from the club's academy, and Lampard because of a transfer ban.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/11/20322404-0-image-a-2_1572349218764.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
