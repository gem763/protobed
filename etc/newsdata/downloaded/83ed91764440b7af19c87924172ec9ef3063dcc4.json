Then, with its massive black sail, the yacht could be seen in the distance beside the Statue of Liberty on the cloudy day, making its slow approach to Manhattan.\n\nThe Swedish teenager\u2019s voyage to the United States from Britain on a zero-carbon yacht has focused the world\u2019s attention on the urgent issue of climate change, as she is set to attend the United Nations summit on zero emissions next month. From a modest protest in front of the Swedish parliament, she will now be invited to speak among international dignitaries.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

And vote for leaders who actually make changes.\u201d\n\nMs Thunberg is set to attend events at the United Nations just miles away in Manhattan during her stay in America, including a strike outside of those offices led by high school students just like those who came to greet her. The UN will conduct its climate summit in September.\n\nShe is expected to travel to Chile later this year, too, where world leaders are scheduled to meet for annual United Nations climate talks.\n\nMs Thunberg first drew international attention for starting a sit-down protest outside of the Swedish parliament just one year ago, demanding action on climate change.\n\nHer initial sit-down protest in August of last year quickly drew the support of fellow students internationally, as the efforts were reported on in the media and the \u201cFridays for future\u201d movement was created.\n\nMs Thunberg\u2019s trip across the Atlantic on the 18-metre yacht that landed in Manhattan started in the British port city of Plymouth 14 August, where fans waved her off.\n\nThe voyage encountered some rough waters along the way, delaying her plans some, even as she and the crew posted photos and tweets along the way.\n\nThe issues facing Ms Thunberg included criticism after a spokesman for the boat-s co-skipper told Berlin newspaper TAZ that people would be flying to New York to take the yacht to Europe \u2014 even though the solar panel laden yacht was chosen as a form of travel in order to avoid carbon emissions from plane travel.\n\nWhen the boat arrived in New York harbour on Wednesday, just as it was passing the Statue of Liberty, it was welcomed by a flotilla of 17 sailing boats, each with a sustainable development goal written onto their sails.\n\nMs Thunberg has not said when she might return to Europe.\n\nBut, for now, she said she is going to take it slow after what has been a remarkably fast journey to international fame since she first began her protest one year ago.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m going to first finish this press conference and then go back to the boat and get my stuff and then I\u2019m going to rest,\u201d she said.", "description": "After 15 days at sea, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg has arrived at a pier in New York City\u2019s lower Manhattan, as she continues her quest to raise awareness about climate change \u2014 and fight for a zero carbon future.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/28/18/Greta-Thunberg-climate-change-united-nations.jpg"}
