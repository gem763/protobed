Chanting about the climate emergency, frankly, they seemed a bit sheepish, not used to it. Their ordinariness makes Extinction Rebellion, or XR, especially effective: farmers, scientists, doctors, Cumbrians and other local platoons stand at the 12 key roadblocks.\n\nAfter their successful capture of central London in April, local cells or \u201caffinity groups\u201d all over the country have trained and planned for this protest. Deciding who would be \u201carrestable\u201d for highway obstruction \u2013 and who wouldn\u2019t be, because of jobs or young families \u2013 they were primed to expect a tougher police response after rightwing press complaints against the friendly policing last April, when officers were caught dancing at a blocked Oxford Circus.\n\nExtinction Rebellion has won the first battle \u2013 now it must win the war | Leo Barasi Read more\n\n\u201cI do wonder if protest makes a difference,\u201d an office manager in her 40s from Hertfordshire said to me. \u201cBut what else can you do? My children really made me feel I must.\u201d A steward in a pink gilet, a mother from south London, said the same: \u201cIt was my children who got me into this.\u201d Thousands more are expected to join.\n\nFor those who doubt the effect of last April\u2019s XR protests, Ben Page of Ipsos Mori says: \u201cIn our polls in 2013, 59% said the planet was \u2018heading for disaster\u2019. This year it\u2019s gone up to 78%.\u201d He reckons Greta Thunberg, the school strikes and XR action played their part. What packs an extra punch is that London is just one of 60 global cities engaged in \u201cuprising\u201d at the same time. To those who say why bother, when the UK is too small for our carbon emissions to matter, this synchronised global action reaches all those leaders who attended last month\u2019s UN climate change summit \u2013 where the UN general secretary warned: \u201cWe face a direct existential threat.\u201d\n\nI think few of these protesters read the rightwing press to know what they\u2019re up against. In a double-page spread in the Mail on Sunday, Douglas Murray, Spectator associate editor and author of Neoconservatism: Why We Need it, launched a blistering attack on climate protesters and soft policing tactics. He writes: \u201cTheir refusal to acknowledge any view but their own deranged belief and their defiance of democratic norms is authoritarian, even fascistic \u2026 Despite the childish certainty these extremists promote, the science of climate change is deeply contested. Most scientists agree there are variations going on but they disagree on exactly what causes it.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:00 'We have the right to rebel': Extinction Rebellion begin Westminster shutdown \u2013 video\n\nSo that\u2019s where the climate deniers are now, ignoring Nasa\u2019s survey showing 97% of global climate scientists agree that the five warmest years have been the past five, \u201cextremely likely due to human activities\u201d. Never mind the science: what free-market obsessives like Murray can\u2019t bear is that solving the climate crisis requires state and international action. He would rather boil to oblivion, faithful to his free-market creed, than see the planet saved by means he regards as statist or even socialist. \u201cAnarchists\u201d and \u201cwarmed-over communists\u201d demanding \u201cdraconian solutions\u201d, he calls the protesters. His disgust spews out at Thunberg, \u201cthis privileged young girl \u2026 hectoring others on things she barely understands \u2026 delivering unhinged sermons to the credulous global elites\u201d. Among the deadly weapons used against activists is that too many are middle class, and they are all climate hypocrites. Progressives are prone to self-flagellation, but being climate-pure is impossible. Do what you can, cast off the guilt. Murray\u2019s is the blind rage of the losing side. David Attenborough is believed, not the Mail on Sunday. Even delivery drivers angry at the roadblocks weren\u2019t denying the gravity of the cause. Weekly the news tells of sea ice and glaciers melting, species vanishing, the emergency evident: pollsters find people well understand it and trust the scientists who say humans are the cause.\n\nMurray accuses XR of wanting to \u201cengineer the complete destruction of the global economic system\u201d. But this highly democratic group is carefully nonprescriptive. All they ask is for politicians to accept the emergency, for a much tighter target than 2050 for net-zero carbon (the UK is already badly behind, our statutory Committee on Climate Change says) \u2013 and for a citizens assembly, such as President Macron has just set up with a sample group of 150 citizens to advise on how France can cut carbon emissions. That\u2019s the task: finding solutions people will vote for.\n\nAt the party conferences, the Tories barely mentioned climate, while Boris Johnson talks of fuel tax cuts. But Labour puts a green industrial strategy at the heart of its spending plans, building renewables in wind and solar, solar panels and insulation for a million social homes, \u00a33.6bn on charging points and free loans for electric cars, nationalising the grid for a vast expansion of 37 offshore wind farms, tidal energy from Swansea Bay and no fracking.\n\nThe UK may be entering a climate culture change that Page compares to the shift in our lifetimes from locking up gay people to a recent poll that found 66% would have no concerns about a same-sex marriage in the royal family. Flying, driving, eating beef may go the way of smoking \u2013 but only if the heavy lifting is done by the state.\n\n\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The public is finally waking up to the gravity of the cause, says Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee", "authors": ["Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48d37b7594e801547e45bffcb5327164bb6fa62f/0_294_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d98068655ac4508cdd46780cbde32a67", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
