The final agreements have been submitted to the Tanzanian Attorney General for review and legalization.\n\nThe terms of the agreement include the payment of $300 million to settle all outstanding tax and other disputes; the lifting of the concentrate export ban; the sharing of future economic benefits from the mines on a 50/50 basis; and the establishment of a unique, Africa-focused international dispute resolution framework.\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with the finalization of the agreement, a new operating company called Twiga Minerals Corporation (\u201cTwiga\u201d) has been formed to manage the Bulyanhulu, North Mara and Buzwagi mines. (Twiga is the Swahili word for giraffe, Tanzania\u2019s national symbol.) The GoT will acquire a free carried shareholding of 16% in each of the mines and will receive its half of the economic benefits from taxes, royalties, clearing fees and participation in all cash distributions made by the mines and Twiga. An annual true-up mechanism will ensure the maintenance of the 50/50 split.\n\nSpeaking after a meeting with the chairman of the Negotiating Committee of the Government of Tanzania, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi, Barrick president and chief executive Mark Bristow said the agreements introduced a new era of productive partnership with the GoT and would ensure that Tanzania and its people would share fully in the value created by the mines they hosted. It also marked the end of the long impasse between the GoT and Acacia which had led, among other things, to the closure of North Mara and the freezing of export concentrate from the two other operations.\n\nBarrick took over the management of the mines after its buy-out of the Acacia minorities last month. Since then it has negotiated the re-opening of North Mara and is engaging with the mines\u2019 host communities to restore their social license.\n\n\u201cRebuilding these operations after three years of value destruction will require a lot of work, but the progress we\u2019ve already made will be greatly accelerated by this agreement. Twiga, which will give the government full visibility of and participation in operating decisions made for and by the mines, represents our new partnership not only in spirit but also in practice,\u201d Bristow said.\n\nHe noted that Tanzanian nationals were already being employed and trained to replace expatriate staff as had been done very successfully at Barrick\u2019s other African operations.\n\nBarrick Enquiries\n\nPresident and chief executive\n\nMark Bristow\n\n+1 647 205 7694\n\n+44 788 071 1386 COO, Africa and Middle East\n\nWillem Jacobs\n\n+44 779 557 5271\n\n+243 820 678 040 Investor and media relations\n\nKathy du Plessis\n\n+44 20 7557 7738\n\nEmail: barrick@dpapr.com\n\nWebsite: www.barrick.com\n\n\n\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\n\nCertain information contained or incorporated by reference in this press release, including any information as to Barrick\u2019s strategy, projects, plans, or future financial or operating performance, constitutes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d.

In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks).\n\nMany of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us.
