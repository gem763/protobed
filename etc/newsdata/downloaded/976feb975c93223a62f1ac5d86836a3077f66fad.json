My bet is there will be Tiffany boutiques\u2014featuring jewelry and a corporate gift section\u2014within larger LVMH stores.\u201d\n\nLVMH encompasses 75 upscale brands, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Sephora, Givenchy, Fendi, and Bulgari. And all the major brands have stores globally.\n\nThis past weekend, news leaked that LVMH approached Tiffany with a takeover offer of $120 a share in cash. Both companies confirmed they were in preliminary discussions about a cash buyout.\n\n\u201cThere can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement,\u201d LVMH said in a press release Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Tiffany said its board of directors is reviewing the unsolicited proposal \u201cto determine the course of action it believes is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.\u201d\n\nBoth companies didn\u2019t respond to requests for further comment.\n\nThe LVMH Group\u2019s jewelry and watch lineup, currently including brands such as Bulgari, Hublot, and TAG Heuer, mainly competes with Cartier\u2014a subsidiary of Switzerland-based Richemont Group\u2014and Tiffany.\n\nThis business unit only brought in about 9% of LVMH\u2019s overall revenue in the first quarter of 2019. Meanwhile, fashion and leather goods accounted for almost half of the total quarterly revenue of \u20ac12.5 billion (US$13.9 billion), according to the company\u2019s quarterly filings. The company\u2019s annual revenue in 2018 was close to \u20ac46.8 billion.\n\nHowever, jewelry is the fastest-growing business within the luxury sector overall. In 2018, the global jewelry market grew 7% and was worth about \u20ac18 billion, according to Bain & Co., a global management consultancy.\n\n\u201c While investors know Tiffany for silver jewelry, the reality is that it is very adjacent to Cartier, notably with mainland Chinese consumers. \u201d \u2014Erwan Rambourg\n\n\u201cWere the bid for Tiffany to go through, it would increase the separation between LVMH and competitors,\u201d said Erwan Rambourg, global co-head of consumer and retail at HSBC, in a client note. \u201cWhile investors know Tiffany for silver jewelry, the reality is that it is very adjacent to Cartier, notably with mainland Chinese consumers.\u201d\n\nIn the past years, the 182-year-old Tiffany has pushed an expansion into China, with plans to open stores in several major cities. Its flagship New York store on Fifth Avenue has been renovated to include a restaurant decorated with its iconic Robin\u2019s egg blue colors, to be more immediately associated with the famed movie Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\n\n\u201cTiffany is now more about the \u2018T\u2019 brand, the blue color, and the experiential breakfast, which is auspicious to appeal to a broader consumer group, especially international tourists,\u201d Newlin says.\n\nWith skyrocketing costs of real estate for luxury retail, Tiffany needs an infusion of money and support, she says.\n\nOn the other hand, large LVMH stores are also underperforming. \u201cIf you got a marque name like Tiffany, luxury customers do want to come to,\u201d she says.\n\nFounded in 1837 by jeweler Charles Lewis Tiffany, and expanded under the artistic direction of his son, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Tiffany & Co. was sold to Avon Products Inc. for about US$104 million in November 1978. In August 1984, Avon sold Tiffany to an investor group led by William R. Chaney for US$135.5 million in cash. Tiffany went public in 1987.\n\nThe company has an annual revenue of US$4 billion. LVMH\u2019s US$120-per-share offer values the company at US$14.5 billion. At Tuesday\u2019s close, Tiffany was trading at US$126.8 a share, up from US$98.55 on Friday.\n\nA fair valuation of the jeweler would be about US$160 a share or higher, according to Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen. He wrote in a note that Tiffany\u2019s \u201cstrategic positioning as a gifting authority, brand DNA as a diamond and bridal authority, are leading qualities and deserve an exceptional premium.\u201d\n\nHSBC estimates that US$135 a share \u201cwould be enough to convince the Tiffany board and holders to accept LVMH\u2019s bid,\u201d the bank\u2019s clients\u2019 note said.\n\nIn any case, Tiffany would be one of the biggest acquisitions by Bernard Arnault, LVMH\u2019s chief executive and controlling shareholder. The 70-year-old is the third-richest person in the world, with a net worth over US$100 billion.", "description": "The famed New York-based jewelry brand could be traveling to luxury stores around the world if a sale happens", "authors": ["Fang Block", "Erwan Rambourg"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-121891/social", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
