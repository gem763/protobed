Out of those, the SafeSport Center has 1,290 open cases, with 2,237 that have been closed. It has 18 investigators and lawyers (with four vacancies) on a staff of 37 (with six vacancies) to handle them. The center projects it will need to double its staff next year and triple it by 2023 to keep up with the work.\n\nThe stark numbers lend urgency to a fight over who should fund the center in the long term. The USOPC, which founded the center, is pushing the federal government to provide more than what it currently allots \u2014 a $2.2 million grant spread over three years, none of which can be used for investigations.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an \u2018And\u2019 question, not an \u2018Or\u2019 question,\u201d said USOCP CEO Sarah Hirshland, who has been lobbying lawmakers to provide government money to help.\n\nTwo senators, meanwhile, have proposed a bill that, in addition to adding oversight to the Olympic movement, would compel the USOPC and NGBs to essentially double what they provide now, increasing the grants to a total of $20 million a year.\n\nNearly half of the 50 NGBs operate on annual budgets of $3 million or less, and though each NGB pays according to its size and, in extreme cases, the number of reports its sport has referred to the center, there is concern that neither the NGBs nor the USOPC can absorb big increases in their SafeSport budgets.\n\n\u201cThe $20 million proposal would absolutely force us to make some difficult choices,\u201d Hirshland said.\n\nThe USOPC brought in around $323 million in revenue in 2018, up from $183 million in \u201917; the federation\u2019s numbers spike in Olympic years and go down during non-Olympic years. It uses the money to support athletes in a number of ways \u2014 including training, insurance, prize money for winners of major events and NGB funding. Last year, administrative costs rose to more than 11% of total spending ($31.2 million) because of payments to two law firms that did work involving the sex-abuse scandal and a severance to former CEO Scott Blackmun.\n\nHirshland and other leaders are pointing to the model that funds the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency; USADA received about $9.5 million of its $21 million in 2018 revenue from government, an additional $5.1 million from the USOPC and $6.7 million from \u201ctesting and other services,\u201d according to its annual report.\n\n\u201cI think that makes sense, because we\u2019re addressing societal issue, and government\u2019s authority to protect and serve fits in really well in that area,\u201d said Max Cobb, the CEO of U.S. Biathlon, who heads up the NGB Council.\n\nBut the red tape the center had to go through to receive the $2.2 million, combined with the restrictions put on the money and uncertainty over the congressional appropriations process, gives pause to the new center\u2019s CEO, Ju\u2019Riese Colon, about relying too heavily on government funding.\n\n\u201cThe USOPC and the NGBs must be invested in changing their sport culture, which means they must invest in the center,\u201d Colon said, while adding that she\u2019s not against receiving money from the government, as well. \u201cWhile I appreciate people connecting us (to USADA) because we\u2019re certainly similar, the job and scope is so different, and I think the funding is going to have to be a lot different.\u201d\n\nWhen he and Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., introduced the bill that calls for $20 million, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., called it a more direct and dependable pathway for the center to receive the money than relying on government.\n\n\u201cHaving a secure and stable source of funding is very important. It fortifies the independence and integrity\u201d of the center, Blumenthal said.\n\nRecently, the House passed a spending bill that included $2.5 million for the SafeSport Center. The Senate is expected to consider that bill next week.\n\nEven if that money gets approved, the center will need more to keep up with its caseload.\n\nAround the time it opened in March 2017, the center received an average of 31 reports a month. That number exploded in the beginning of 2018, when Larry Nassar\u2019s victims spoke up during his sentencing hearing for sex crimes. By last fall, with the #MeToo movement in full swing and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearing making headlines, the number spiked again.\n\nIt\u2019s grown even more in 2019, with each sex-related headline triggering more calls.\n\nMeanwhile, an independent consultant hired by the center projects the number of calls will continue to increase until it caps at around 8,000 a year \u2014 an average of 667 a month.\n\nColon says many of the reports could become less complicated as the knowledge from center\u2019s education programs seeps into sports communities and issues are reported before they become overly complicated. About one-fifth of the center\u2019s workforce (eight employees) is devoted to education and outreach programs to serve up to 18 million members of national governing bodies across the country. So far, the center has trained about 800,000 of those people.\n\nThe independent consultant suggested to Colon that, given the workload, the center could use $35 million in 2020. But the center has more modest hopes \u2014 hoping to increase USOPC and NGB donations to bring next year\u2019s budget to $16 million.", "description": "In the wake of high-profile sexual abuse cases in U.S. Olympic sports, the U.S. Center for SafeSport is now receiving an average of 239 reports a month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8223b53b0000c49fd6b193.jpeg?cache=bieqsjsomv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
