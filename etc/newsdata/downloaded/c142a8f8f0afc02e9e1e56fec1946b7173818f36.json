It has a polystyrene enclosure that is covered in aluminized mylar to \"minimize thermal radiation and protected by an infrared-transparent wind cover,\" according to the statement.\n\nIt eventually drew heat from the surrounding air and released it back into the night sky through a simple black emitter.\n\nRadiative cooling, as described by Space.com, allows a surface to pass its heat to the atmosphere and is cooler than the air that surrounds it.\n\n\"This phenomenon explains how frost forms on grass during above-freezing nights, and the same principle can be used to generate electricity, harnessing temperature differences to produce renewable electricity at night, when lighting demand peaks,\" the statement added.\n\nRaman and the other researchers believe that if they're able to make some modifications, the device could be used on a wider scale and also in particularly hot and dry climates.\n\nARMY EYES PEARLS IN INNOVATING PROJECT TO BOLSTER BODY ARMOR\n\n\"Our work highlights the many remaining opportunities for energy by taking advantage of the cold of outer space as a renewable energy resource,\" Raman added. \"We think this forms the basis of a complementary technology to solar. While the power output will always be substantially lower, it can operate at hours when solar cells cannot.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "An innovative new device is able to generate electricity from the night sky, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/NIGHT-SKY-ENERGY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
