I was looking for an opportunity to speak to her,\u201d he says. But when he told her his name, her reaction wasn\u2019t quite what he expected. \u201cI was shocked because he had the same name as my previous boyfriend, who was killed in a car crash a few months earlier,\u201d Emily says. Though she had only dated him for a short period, she was devastated by his death. \u201cHe was very young and it was all over the news, so it had been quite a hard time for me.\u201d Though she didn\u2019t believe in fate, she says the chances of meeting two people with the same name \u201cfelt spooky\u201d.\n\nAt the party they chatted about their interest in photography, before she invited him to see her band play the following night. It wasn\u2019t until a week later that she told Takahiro about her previous boyfriend. \u201cI suddenly understood why her expression went a bit funny,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt all made sense.\u201d\n\nEmily, who is originally from Tasmania, had been living in Japan for three years and was working as a teacher when they met. \u201cAfter he came to my gig, we had our first date in Starbucks and some of my students came in. They were asking if he was my boyfriend, which was embarrassing,\u201d she laughs.\n\nWithin a week, though, Takahiro had asked Emily to meet his family. \u201cI thought it was fast,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it felt so normal and natural to be together. It was the first time I\u2019d felt that with another person.\u201d\n\nA few months later, Takahiro had the chance to be interviewed for a job in Jamaica, but didn\u2019t take up the offer. \u201cI knew it would mean leaving the country for a couple of years. I turned it down at the very last minute. Maybe it was my subconscious telling me to stay.\u201d\n\nOver the next two years, the couple explored Japan, taking their cameras with them everywhere they went. They also shared a passion for food, and enjoyed trying out ramen restaurants and whisky bars in new places.\n\n\u201cWe would travel to see my family regularly and I also had the chance to visit Tasmania in 2010, which was beautiful,\u201d says Takahiro.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emily and Takahiro on their wedding day in 2011.

We celebrated with 20 of our closest family and friends who came from Tasmania and Japan,\u201d says Emily. \u201cThen we went on honeymoon to Hawaii, which is a really popular destination for Japanese couples.\u201d\n\nShe adds that she didn\u2019t have to change her name like most Japanese spouses must do by law. As she was a foreigner, it wasn\u2019t compulsory for the couple to have the same surname.\n\nThe couple speak English and Japanese. \u201cI do get homesick sometimes,\u201d Emily says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that he understands my language and perspective.\u201d She says he is easygoing and a great sounding board when she is feeling stressed; he loves how open-minded and accepting she is. \u201cShe\u2019s also a brilliant cook. When I first met her, she wasn\u2019t good but I never told her. She\u2019s amazing now though.\u201d\n\nThe couple are now living happily in the area of Japan where they first met, with their four-year-old son. However, Emily admits she misses her home, and their long-term plan is to move to Australia. \u201cJust before we met I had been planning to go back to Tasmania, but now I\u2019ve been here 13 years because it just felt right,\u201d says Emily. \u201cI\u2019d never believed in finding \u2018the one\u2019 or anything like that. But when he told me his name I had this internal freakout. It\u2019s been 10 years since we met but I\u2019ve never met another Takahiro since.\u201d\n\nWant to share your story?
