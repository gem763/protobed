Elizabeth Warren responds to a question during a forum held by the Giffords group and March For Our Lives in Las Vegas, Nev., October 2, 2019. (Steve Marcus/Reuters)\n\nThose of us who are not fans of Elizabeth Warren and who think she\u2019s gotten mostly a free ride from the media are enjoying the current moment, where Democratic rivals are hammering her over a stubborn refusal to admit that paying for Medicare for All would require tax increases on more than just \u201cthe rich\u201d and big corporations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last debate, when asked, \u201cSenator Sanders acknowledges he\u2019s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for all. You\u2019ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?\u201d Warren responded by shifting to discussion of \u201ccosts\u201d and hoping no one would notice the difference.\n\n\u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Warren, her rivals did notice.\n\nPete Buttigieg called the issue a \u201ca yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer.\u201d Amy Klobuchar said, \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Biden got in on it, too: \u201cThe plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget . . . If you\u2019re making \u2014 if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan.\u201d\n\nAsk Warren about the costs, and she\u2019ll respond a non sequitur about how awful it is when insurance companies refuse to cover particular treatments.\n\nNow Warren is promising to come out with a more detailed plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bad news for those of us who like seeing her grilled is that her answers or non-answers may not matter much. She\u2019s following a well-worn playbook by previous successful Democratic candidates. Democratic presidential candidates insist that their plans will not increase taxes on the middle class, and furthermore pledge to reduce the tax burden on the middle class. And then, once inaugurated, they suddenly reveal, \u201coh, wait, never mind, your taxes are going up after all.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail in 1992, Bill Clinton promised an income tax cut for the middle class; once he was in office, he abandoned the plan to cut income taxes and enacted a variety of tax hikes, some of which hit the middle class: raising the federal tax on gasoline, raising the percentage of Social Security benefits subject to income taxes, phasing out various deductions, and raising the alternative minimum tax.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen-Senator Obama promised, on Sept. 12, 2008, speaking in Dover, N.H., \u201cI can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as president, Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, which enacted 21 new taxes, some of which hit the middle class.\n\nSeparately, under President Obama temporary payroll tax break was not renewed in in 2013, creating a de facto tax increase for millions of workers. A worker making $50,000 per year found his tax bill going up by about $1,000.\n\nAny country that has almost $23 trillion in debt is not one that spends a lot of time worrying about how the government is going to pay for its promises. While running for president, Donald Trump pledged to completely eliminate the debt \u2014 not the annual deficit, but the entire federal debt \u2014 within eight years. Needless to say, he hasn\u2019t come close; we\u2019re back to trillion-per-year deficits again. If Republican primary voters aren\u2019t asking about how we\u2019re going to pay for things, there\u2019s no way Democratic primary voters are.\n\nSure, the pledge to not raise taxes on the middle class is a lie. But a lot of voters want to believe the lie.", "description": "The bad news for those of us who like seeing her grilled is that her answers or non-answers may not matter much.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
