(Image: EPA)\n\nThe same could be true with men who sink loads of drinks because they are showing they are hard enough to deal with the physical impacts of necking tonnes of booze.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Binge drinking among young men serves as a \u201ccostly signal\u201d to potential mates, such that the binge drinker is capable of bearing the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption,\u2019 academics wrote in a paper for the journal Evolutionary Psychology.\n\nThey added: \u2018Binge drinking could communicate information about resources, underlying mate quality, mating competition, and mating strategies.\n\n\u2018Because alcohol is a luxury good, alcohol consumption may reflect wealth.\u2019\n\nThe paper explored how the \u2018operational sex ratio\u2019 between men and women (which indicates how many partners of each gender are single and looking to mingle).\n\nIt suggested that men were more likely to binge drink when there were relatively low numbers of available women \u2013 whilst ladies showed the opposite effect and drank less.\n\nPubs and clubs are sites of male competition for female attention in which \u2018young men gathered and drank alcohol primarily to compete for female attention and show off their masculinity to both women and other men\u2019, the authours added.\n\n\u2018The ability to withstand these detrimental effects could signal \u201cvigour\u201d and advertise mate quality,\u2019 they continued.\n\n\u2018This idea is related to [a theory called the] handicap principle, where females of many species prefer males that display exaggerated traits that are costly to maintain and develop; hence, these traits serve as \u201chonest\u201d signals.\n\n\u2018Indeed, occasional drinkers and frequent drinkers were rated as significantly more attractive than nondrinkers, especially in short-term mating contexts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Additionally, a recent review of the evolution of human sex-specific cognitive abilities by Geary (2017) identifies alcohol as a stressor/intoxicant that compromises the building, maintenance, and expression of sexually selected traits.\n\n\u2018Thus the ability to function despite consuming alcohol (i.e., to \u201chold your liquor\u201d), especially among men, might signal that the binge drinker is of sufficient quality to cope with the harmful consequences of alcohol.\u2019", "description": "A new study has proposed that heavy boozing among young adults shows 'the signaler\u2019s willingness to take risks'.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRI_85973315_1570440901.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
