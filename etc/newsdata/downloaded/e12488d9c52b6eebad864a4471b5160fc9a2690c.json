That is risky for media freedom and diversity in South Africa,\" he said in a statement.\n\nBut Icasa spokesperson Paseka Maleka said the number was around 29 stations and their closure was because they did not possess the required broadcasting licences.\n\nIcasa had not embarked on a mission, nor had plans, to shut down any validly operating community service, Maleka said.\n\n\"Whilst Icasa appreciates and supports the critical role that the community radio sector plays in promoting social cohesion, fostering diversity and uplifting or empowering our communities, Icasa will neither promote nor allow illegal broadcasting and illegal use of the radio frequency spectrum,\" added Icasa CEO Willington Ngwepe.\n\n\"It is for this reason that the closing down of any community radio station or any other licensee becomes a step that is taken as an absolutely last resort, after repeated instances of non-compliance and repeated attempts on the side of the authority to get the licensees to remedy same.\"\n\nThe ministers called upon the sector to ensure compliance with the legislation and use existing support mechanisms provided by Icasa and MDDA.\n\n\"The ministers have also resolved to continue engagements with the respective portfolio entities towards finalising a support strategy which is imperative in finding a lasting solution for the sustainability of community media,\" their departments said.", "description": "Two ministers have entered the fray over the closure of around 29 non-compliant community radio stations by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa , stating that they want to find a solution urgently.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8340/0ff0374d68df4b859ab50166c321ddc1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
