Additionally, we look to what a successful implementation might mean for bilateral relations between the two NATO allies. If the roadmap announced by the United States and Turkey can be implemented in a sustainable fashion acceptable to all parties, it could mark an upswing in the bilateral relationship and possibly lead to an easing of tensions over Syria.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA small city in northern Syria, Manbij was under the control of ISIS until the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a grouping of U.S.-backed Syrians heavily dominated by the YPG, captured the city in August 2016. The YPG is the armed branch of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), which Turkey considers to be the Syrian branch of the PKK (Kurdish Workers' Party), a terrorist organization that has been waging a war in southeastern Turkey for several decades.2 While the United States recognizes the PKK as a terrorist organization and Obama administration officials repeatedly admitted that ties exist between the PKK and the PYD, the Obama administration declined to end its support for the PYD.\n\nThe United States had begun communicating with the PYD via intermediaries by October 2014,3 but U.S. coordination with and support for the YPG began to greatly expand in 2015, when the Obama administration decided to move away from train-and-equip programs aimed at starting up new organizations in favor of supporting existing groups in Syria.4 The 2015 decision, which Turkey saw as a sign that the United States had never been committed to the train-and-equip program, fostered mistrust in an already strained relationship. As part of the new strategy, the Syrian Kurdish YPG and some Syrian Arab militias grouped under the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAC) established the Democratic Forces of Syria (later the Syrian Democratic Forces, SDF) in October 2015 and announced that they had been promised weapons and supplies by the United States.5 A U.S. official told reporters at the time that the group would launch an offensive down the eastern bank of the Euphrates River towards Raqqa, ISIS's capital city in Syria.6\n\nSince then, the United States has maintained its partnership with the SDF and the YPG components of that organization. Under both the Obama and Trump administrations, Washington has equipped the SDF with supplies, vehicles, weapons, training, air strikes and other support. Since 2014, the SDF, and thereby the YPG, has expanded its territory to include all of the Turkish-Syrian border east of the Euphrates, giving it a 250-mile border with Turkey, and pressed south towards Raqqa and Deir Ez-Zor, capturing the Syrian town of Manbij on the west side of the Euphrates.\n\nEVOLUTION OF U.S.-TURKISH RELATIONS\n\nThe status of Manbij and surrounding territories has been an issue between the United States and Turkey since even before the SDF began operations to recapture the city in June 2016. After the U.S. special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, Brett McGurk, made a trip to Kobani \u2014 confirmed in February 2016 \u2014 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked, \"Am I your partner or are the terrorists in Kobane?\"7 Turkish officials repeatedly stressed throughout 2015 and 2016 that they would not accept a Kurdish presence west of the Euphrates or attempts to establish a contiguous Kurdish statelet along the Syria-Turkey border. In both public statements and private meetings, U.S. officials offered guarantees to Turkey about the YPG and U.S. relations with the group. These statements included warnings to the YPG not to engage in any hostile action against Turkey and commitments to Turkey that the U.S. relationship with the SDF was temporary and transactional. Despite these U.S. assurances, Turkey remained concerned about the relationship and continued to try to persuade Washington of the adverse effects that its partnership with the YPG would have on the Turkish-American alliance and the region as a whole.\n\nThe SDF operation to retake Manbij threatened to cross Turkey's red line regarding a YPG presence on the western Euphrates. On June 1, 2016, U.S. officials told Reuters news agency that U.S.-backed groups in the SDF had begun operations to retake what they called the \"Manbij pocket,\" the area surrounding the town of Manbij. However, the official stated that YPG forces comprised only a fifth or sixth of the total SDF forces and that \"after they take Manbij, the agreement is, the YPG will not be staying.\"8 Ahead of the operation to take Manbij, in April 2016, a U.S. delegation including diplomats and military officers reportedly visited Turkey to discuss the planned operation.9 In May, the United States reportedly brokered a meeting between SDF and Turkish officials to allow the SDF to launch the assault on Manbij without triggering a Turkish military response.10", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
