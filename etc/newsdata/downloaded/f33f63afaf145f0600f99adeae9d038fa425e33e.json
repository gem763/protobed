Libra\u2019s creator, Sentis, said it \u201cwould like to apologize publicly\u201d in response to Brydge\u2019s complaint, and that it does not expect product delays because of the redesign. But after reviewing mock-ups of the changes, Brydge says they don\u2019t go far enough.\n\nBrydge sued to take down the Libra keyboard last week, claiming that the product infringed on a patent it owns and on which its own keyboards rely. The patent largely focused on the pair of U-shaped hinges that Brydge\u2019s keyboards use to hold onto an iPad and then rotate open and closed like a laptop. Brydge\u2019s CEO said it was \u201ca bit of a kick in the face\u201d to see Libra launch on Kickstarter.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is important that your backers are aware of this.\u201d\n\nIn an update to backers, Sentis said it was \u201cunaware\u201d of the similarities between their designs. \u201cIn order to avoid further arguments, we have decided to redesign Libra\u2019s keyboard hinge,\u201d the company wrote. The new design will have a different look, and Sentis said it will share images later this week. Mock-ups included with the post still show a U-shaped hinge design, just one that connects across the entirety of the keyboard, rather than having separate hinges at either end.\n\n\u201cAgain, please accept our sincerest apologies,\u201d Sentis wrote.\n\nBrydge says that, based on the images posted, the Libra keyboard still infringes on its patent. \u201cWe believe it is important that your backers are aware of this so that they can make an informed decision,\u201d Brydge wrote in a comment beneath Sentis\u2019 post.\n\nThe Libra keyboard immediately stood out when it launched on Kickstarter for being one of the very first iPad keyboard attachments to include a trackpad. Apple just added mouse support to iPadOS last month, and for people who want to turn their iPad Pro into something that closely resembles a MacBook Pro, Sentis quickly gave them an option. (Though shipping isn\u2019t expected until January.)\n\nMy colleague Sam Byford tried out the keyboard last week, writing that \u201cthe Libra isn\u2019t perfect but is useful for writing and editing.\u201d\n\nBrydge revealed that it, too, is working on an iPad keyboard with a trackpad. It intends to start shipping limited quantities in January or February.\n\nSentis\u2019 redesign throws another wrench into Brydge\u2019s already complicated lawsuit over the Libra. Brydge didn\u2019t actually sue Sentis, seemingly because it could not find any information on Sentis, and it instead sued a company called OGadget, which later said it had only done marketing for Sentis. Brydge also sued Kickstarter, seemingly with the intent of getting the product taken down before the crowdfunding campaign could end.\n\nBrydge says its lawsuit will continue \u201cuntil our intellectual property rights are respected and infringement of our patent ceases.\u201d Despite claims from Sentis that the two companies are \u201cactively communicating,\u201d Brydge says that it still hasn\u2019t heard from Sentis directly.\n\nSentis\u2019 Kickstarter campaign now has almost 1,780 backers and $228,000 raised.", "description": "Libra\u2019s creator, Sentis, said it \"would like to apologize publicly\" in response to Brydge\u2019s complaint, and that it does not expect product delays because of the redesign.
