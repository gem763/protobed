We won some great balls in midfield and counter-attack, but it was just that last little bit and then obviously the mistakes.\n\n\u201cOverall, we can be better of course, and like I say we\u2019ll take responsibility. We\u2019ll move forward and try and react in the right way.\u201d\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp added: \u201cThis was a much better game than we played last time when we lost 1-0 in the last minute (to Napoli last season). It was an open game, in moments we controlled the game, but we had a lot of counter-attacks and didn\u2019t finish them off.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a problem. Then in the second half we had this wild game, we were running, they were running. They\u2019ve killed everybody on the pitch, started controlling again and then we\u2019ve conceded a penalty. Of course that doesn\u2019t help and I\u2019ve seen it now, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a penalty.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s clear and obvious, no penalty, because Callejon jumps before he has any contact. But we cannot change that so we have to be critical with ourselves. We did well in a lot of moments, we played a lot of good football but we didn\u2019t finish off.\n\n\u201cWe controlled it in moments, but we had not enough chances in the end. What you saw was a lot of respect from both sides, we both defended well and each ball we lost, or they lost, was immediately a threat.\n\n\u201cThe last ball is the most difficult ball anyway, and if you are not in the right circumstances it\u2019s even more difficult. And so there were moments when we should have done better, for sure.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has blamed his side\u2019s lack of cutting edge for their 2-0 defeat away from home by Napoli.
