These agencies are continually engaged in proactive and reactive investigations and prosecutions of persons involved in child abuse and exploitation involving the I\u200bnternet.\u201d\n\nIn a recent statement, U.S. Attorney Matthew Krueger said the nation is dealing with an \u201cepidemic of child sexual abuse, with the Internet making it too easy for predators to communicate with children across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department is committed to working with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to prosecute child sexual abuse aggressively,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "A suspect was arrested after he reportedly walked 351 miles to have sex with someone he thought was a 14-year-old girl.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Tommy-Lee-Jenkins-32-was-arrested-after-he-allegedly-walked-hundreds-of-miles-from-Indiana-to-Wisconsin-to-try-to-have-sex-with-a-14-year-old-girl.-Brown-County-Jail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
