The video was actually from a Kentucky gun range.\n\nIn a Monday statement, ABC News said that it took down the video \u201cimmediately after questions were raised about its accuracy\u201d and that it \u201cregrets the error.\u201d\n\nABC News has not yet provided a full accounting of what happened, and the network offered no additional comment on Wednesday. An ABC News source told POLITICO that the video was provided by a source who claimed to be in a sensitive position at the Syrian border. The network is continuing to investigate the matter.\n\nTrump tweeted on Monday that ABC News \u201cgot caught using really gruesome FAKE footage of the Turks bombing in Syria.\u201d And at Wednesday\u2019s news conference, he said the network \u201cowes an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should get your accounts correct,\u201d Trump told Karl. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t be showing buildings blowing up in Kentucky and saying it\u2019s Syria, because that really is fake news.\u201d\n\nKarl, who also serves as president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, told POLITICO he hadn\u2019t expected Trump to bring up the network\u2019s Syria error when calling on him.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s jabs at his employer, Karl continued to ask the president questions about the Syria pullout and criticism of the move from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is normally one of Trump\u2019s strongest congressional supporters.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/63/91/67532ee0412aa743bc9d152a4afb/191016-trump-karl-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
