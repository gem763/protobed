We believe in socialism. And if we believe in internationalism and socialism - why on earth would we back Brexit?...We all say no, no, no to Brexit.\"\n\nCiting reports that some members of the shadow cabinet wanted to campaign for Remain, she said: \"No s*** Sherlock. Yes we're campaigning to Remain.\"\n\nMs Thornberry said it would be a gift to the Liberal Democrats and SNP if Labour pledged to deliver Brexit, and criticised suggestions that anti-Brexit voices in the party were undermining Mr Corbyn.\n\nShe continued: \"When people have taken a position that we hate Brexit, that we wish to remain and reform the EU, don't you dare question our commitment to socialism and don't you dare question our loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\"It's because of our commitment to socialism and because of our commitment to Jeremy Corbyn that we are here today demanding an outcome that will give Jeremy Corbyn the best chance possible of getting into Number 10.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This time last year we were talking about keeping the option of a People's Vote on the table and now the Labour Party has said whatever the outcome, whether its under this government or the next, it's got to go back to the public to decide a basic question: are you prepared to leave on the terms on offer or do you want to remain?\n\n\"When that time comes I will campaign for Remain alongside millions of other people in this country, because it's not just a technical question of whether you want to be in or out of the EU, it's about what sort of country we want to be.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If you want to make the case for Remain, vote Labour and let's get on with it.\"\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Sir Keir said he wanted to \"work with members\" to find an agreed position, adding: \"I think it's very important that members are heard in this - that's why we have conference...It's undoubtedly the case that the members want to have a view on this, do have a view on this and want to be heard on this.\"\n\nHe told The Independent: \"I think any polling of the party and any engagement with the members demonstrates that a majority of members want to back Remain and therefore we've got to listen to what they've got to say about it, but we do have to find a way forward that everybody is comfortable with.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, a motion proposed by Labour's National Executive Committee was dismissed as a \"procedural stitch-up\".\n\nDespite 90 per cent of motions submitted to the conference by local Labour parties backing Remain, the NEC proposed that a Labour government should delay adopting any position in a possible second Brexit referendum until it had tried to negotiate a new exit deal with the EU.\n\nLabour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said: \u201cThis conference is our one chance before an election to get out of the fudge \u2013 we cannot allow that to be taken away from us in some procedural stitch up.\u201d", "description": "Senior members of the shadow cabinet have piled pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to fully oppose Brexit after telling members at Labour's annual conference that the party should back Remain.
