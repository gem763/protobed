They played with verve and determination against a sluggish England who delivered their worst performance since Gareth Southgate took over as manager.\n\nThe defeat ended England\u2019s decade-long unbeaten run in European Championship and World Cup qualifiers going back to a 1-0 loss to Ukraine in Dnipropetrovsk exactly 10 years ago.\n\nSouthgate\u2019s side lacked precision in their passing, fluency in their movement and solidity at the back and the coach was clearly not happy with the display.\n\n\u201cI think we have had a lot of credit over the last couple of years and tonight we did not do enough. Our performance was not good enough, it\u2019s as simple as that. The goals we conceded were typical of the chances we gave away,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCollectively we have to accept there were not enough good performances. We conceded too many poor chances and we gave the ball away too many times,\u201d added Southgate.\n\nSubstitute Zdenek Ondrasek grabbed the winner five minutes from time when he confidently fired past keeper Jordan Pickford after Lukas Masopust burst down the right and picked him out.\n\nIt was a special moment for the burly Ondrasek who was making his national team debut at the age of 30 having enjoyed a recent run of scoring form for FC Dallas in Major League Soccer.\n\nHarry Kane had put England ahead with a penalty in the fifth minute after Raheem Sterling was brought down by Masopust.\n\nBut the Czechs drew level four minutes later when Jakub Brabec turned the ball home at the back post after the ball fell to him when Ondrey Celustka beat Michael Keane to a corner.\n\nThe home side looked sharper and hungrier, with Vladimir Darida excellent and influential in midfield, while England\u2019s shape never looked right.\n\nThe midfield, featuring two holding midfielders in Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice, was unable to get a grip on the game with the result that wingers Sterling and Jadon Sancho received little service.\n\nPickford did well to tip over a dangerous dipping shot from Masopust on the hour but chances were rare until Ondrasek popped up inside the area to end England\u2019s unbeaten qualifying run.\n\nThe result means the Czechs join group leaders England on 12 points with four wins, although they have played one game more.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nEngland face Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday and Kane said they would need to improve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a wake-up call but we\u2019re in a good position. There\u2019s still stuff to work on for sure. We gave the ball away too cheaply and we\u2019ll have to go away and look at it. There\u2019s no need to panic and we\u2019ll go again on Monday.\u201d\n\nGroup A\u2019s other game between Montenegro and Bulgaria ended goalless.", "description": "England suffered their first tournament qualifying defeat for 10 years when they lost 2-1 away to the Czech Republic in their Euro 2020 qualifying Group A clash on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439837002&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A231", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
