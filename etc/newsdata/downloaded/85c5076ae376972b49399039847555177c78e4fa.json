I always give it my all but unfortunately my life depends on the votes to save me from the competition,\u201d said Yiba.\n\nThe King William\u2019s Town-born 24-year-old software developer said that whatever happens tonight \u201cit is God\u2019s plan. I am ready for anything.\u201d\n\nLast week Yiba performed Dance Till You Drop by Naak MusiQ and Idols\u2019 judge Somizi Mhlongo wasn\u2019t impressed with his performance. Mhlongo said he felt the song didn\u2019t fit well with the theme, Showstopper.\n\nNot everyone is going to like you, even if you do the best you can Luyolo Yiba\n\nBut the other two judges, Randall Abrahams and Unathi Nkayi, were pleased with his performance. Yiba said he respected the judges\u2019 views but he enjoyed his performance.\n\nYiba said that he took criticism well especially if it was constructive.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is going to like you, even if you do the best you can,\u201d Yiba said.\n\n\u201cIf I win it\u2019s going to be a bonus. I am an artist even outside Idols.\u201d\n\nJudging by the judge\u2019s comments, it\u2019s safe to say last weekend belonged to Viggy Qwabe and Sneziey Msomi.\n\nBut it seems a contestant who might go home tonight could be between Qwabe, simply because Qwabe divided the judges with her performance of Mafikizolo\u2019s Uhuru Khona, or Nolo Seodisha with his rendition of Da Capo\u2019s Speed of Sound.\n\nMicayla Oelofse\u2019s performance of Fifth Harmony\u2019s Worth It, was also met with some qualms by all the three judges as they felt she could have done better.\n\nBut it\u2019s not about how the judges feel \u2013 it is the votes that count.\n\nIf Yiba\u2019s votes save him tonight, he would like to have an opportunity to perform Justin Timberlake\u2019s popular song, Cry Me A River.", "description": "It\u2019s hard to speculate on who is going home tonight, as all the remaining Idols\u2019 contestants did their best to set the stage on fire last Sunday.", "authors": ["Ntombizodwa Makhoba"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/971170ca6a044fe69b112de5043fe083.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
