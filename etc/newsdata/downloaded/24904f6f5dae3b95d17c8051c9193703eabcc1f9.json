And as Democrats earlier this year talked about a Green New Deal plan that would attempt to overhaul the economy to ferret out greenhouse gases, Republicans went on the offensive to, as Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming put it, decry the plan because it meant saying \u201cgoodbye to dairy, to beef, to family farms, to ranches.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, only a small percentage of Democrats are actually vegan or vegetarian\u2014by one measure, the percentage of vegetarians in the country hasn\u2019t moved much since 1999\u2014but with Booker\u2019s veganism now trailing him on the presidential campaign trail, the beef over meat isn\u2019t going away.\n\n\u2014 Saahil Desai\n\nDemocratic Debate 3.0\n\n(ROSARIOSCALIA/ SHUTTERSTOCK FREDERICK M. BROWN / STRINGER / ETHAN MILLER / CHIP SOMODEVILLA / GETTY / ARSH RAZIUDDIN / THE ATLANTIC)\n\nThree Down, Nine More to Go: About Last Night\n\nCandidates have a plan for that\u2014but do they have a plan for passing that? Many candidates declined to go into the weeds, but \u201cthe level of detail in a proposal doesn\u2019t always correspond to its seriousness. Just look at Trump.\u201d Edward-Isaac Dovere reports from behind the scenes in Houston.\n\nHedge of the night: There was at least one direct question that detailed-plans candidate Elizabeth Warren didn\u2019t want to answer: Will she raise taxes on the middle class to fund Medicare for All? Russell Berman examines the taxes-for-government-services tightrope Democrats have long had to navigate.\n\nWhere was the college talk?: K\u201312 education is largely the domain of local governments, Adam Harris notes. Considering all the attention that candidates from Elizabeth Warren to Bernie Sanders to Amy Klobuchar have given this cycle to making college more affordable, why weren\u2019t more of them talking last night about education issues that the executive branch can actually affect?\n\nGuns N\u2019 Poses: The waning candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke leaned into the El Paso\u2013focused reinvention of his campaign: \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he declared. But a moment like that has the potential to permanently change the primary debate on regulating guns, Emma Green writes.\n\nWhat Else We\u2019re Following\n\nHoward University graduates await the commencement speaker Chadwick Boseman in May 2018. (Eric Thayer / Reuters)\n\nWhy do Democrats win cities? There\u2019s no obvious reason for why a movement led by Irish Catholic factory workers in the 1800s became the party of progressives in 2019, but much of it can be traced to the politicization of issues such as abortion and climate change, Derek Thompson writes.", "description": "Is eating meat following plastic straws onto the front lines of the country\u2019s various culture wars?
