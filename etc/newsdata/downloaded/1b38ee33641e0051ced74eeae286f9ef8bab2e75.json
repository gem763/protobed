(AP) - The head of a southeastern New Mexico coalition supporting plans to build a facility to temporary store spent nuclear fuel says supporters have around 18 months to go.\n\nEddy-Lea Energy Alliance Chairman John Heaton last week encouraged fellow board members to keep pushing for the proposed multimillion-dollar facility despite opposition from environmentalists and nuclear watchdog groups, the Hobbs News-Sun reports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the final push. I think this is not the time to be weak of heart,\u201d Heaton told the newspaper while attending the meeting from Washington, D.C. \u201cWe expect a draft (Environmental Impact Statement) to come out in March. Then, there will be hearings following that draft Environmental Impact Statement.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey-based Holtec International is seeking a 40-year license from federal regulators to build the complex near Carlsbad.\n\nHoltec executives say the project is needed because the federal government has yet to find a permanent solution for dealing with the tons of spent fuel building up at nuclear power plants.\n\nThe Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance is a public entity formed through a joint powers agreement among the New Mexico cities of Carlsbad and Hobbs and the counties of Eddy and Lea. The organization owns 1,000 acres of land on which Holtec International Inc. hopes to build and operate the $2.4 billion facility, pending a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nBut New Mexico and industry officials also have concerns about potential effects on oil and gas development, as Holtec\u2019s proposed site is located within the Permian Basin - one of the world\u2019s most prolific energy production regions.\n\nEnvironmentalists and nuclear watchdog groups also have expressed concern about the project.\n\nIn June, U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, D-Albuquerque, sent a letter to the U.S. Energy Department and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, suggesting existing railways weren\u2019t built to withstand the weight of the special casks that would be used to transport the high-level waste from sites around the country.\n\nThe development of a proposed long-term storage site at Nevada\u2019s Yucca Mountain was halted during the Obama administration, but the Trump administration has moved to restart the licensing process despite stiff resistance in Nevada.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Hobbs News-Sun, http://www.hobbsnews.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The head of a southeastern New Mexico coalition supporting plans to build a facility to temporary store spent nuclear fuel says supporters have around 18 months to go.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
