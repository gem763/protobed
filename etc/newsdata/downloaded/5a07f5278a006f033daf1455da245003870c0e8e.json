But the question of how the U.K. will leave the bloc remains unanswered.\n\nJohnson addresses the House of Commons on Tuesday. UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor\n\nThe British public voted for Brexit 2016 but this is the third time the departure has been postponed. It is now on its fourth revised \"deadline\" to leave the E.U.What many lawmakers and E.U. officials fear above all else is that they will reach this deadline without having agreed a deal at all. This \"no deal\" Brexit scenario could cause chaos for the U.K. and its neighbors, possibly triggering economic pain, food shortages and civil unrest.But Parliament is deadlocked because it can't agree which E.U. rules to keep and which to scrap. London has become so closely tied to this continental union that unpicking these will be a complex process.Meanwhile, Johnson wants an early general election that could secure him the parliamentary majority to deliver his Brexit plans \u2014 and perhaps more importantly bolster his power as prime minister.Lawmakers were set to vote this later Monday.", "description": "It is the third such postponement this year.
