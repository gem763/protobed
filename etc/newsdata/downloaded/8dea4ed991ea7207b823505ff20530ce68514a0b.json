The 19-minute film condenses the story of Hiyori Kon, a student and sumo prodigy pushing back against the age-old edict that prevents women from competing in the sport professionally. \u201cI study gender theory,\u201d Hiyori explains in Japanese. \u201cWe learned about many women fighting gender issues all over the world, but there weren\u2019t many Japanese women. Japanese people don\u2019t ask for radical change.\u201d\n\nHiyori Kon and her teammates are an exception. They are determined athletes in a sport that traditionally and controversially does not allow women to compete professionally. But their love of sumo is a ticking time bomb; unless the rules change, they will be forced to retire at the age of 21. Hiyori believes that if female sumo grows in popularity, it will eventually be permitted at a professional level. It is this battle for basic equality that drives her to be the best.\n\nLittle Miss Sumo, directed by Matt Kay, focuses on Hiyori\u2019s preparation for the Sumo World Championships in Taiwan. In the film\u2019s opening minutes, she describes the demoralizing effects of growing as up a little girl who loved wrestling but knew she would one day have to give it up. Over fuzzy home video footage of Hiyori as a small child, wearing gym shorts beneath the ceremonial loincloth, the now 20-year-old narrates, \u201cBoys can aspire to be professional wrestlers. They can easily see a future in sumo. After elementary school, girls tend to quit. There weren\u2019t that many wrestlers little girls could look up to.\u201d Onscreen, young Hiyori barrels into another pigtail-crowned first grader, propelling her out of the ring, or dohyo.\n\nSumo is rooted in ancient rituals that still guide the way it is practiced today, like the use of salt to purify the dohyo. The rules are simple, with each match lasting only a few intense seconds. As soon as a wrestler is forced out of the dohyo or touches the dirt-covered ground with any part of her body except the soles of her feet, the wrestler loses. Competitors wrestle barefoot to grip the ground with their feet.\n\nKay relies on beautiful slow-motion shots to convey the extreme strength and artistry required of each athlete. Flesh ripples against flesh, then against the sand with a hollow thud as Hiyori slips her toes underneath the ball of her male opponent\u2019s foot. Calf muscles strain in a fight to remain erect against the force of another wrestler\u2019s body weight. Unsurprisingly, a physical therapist informs Hiyori that knee injuries are the most common risk of sumo wrestling. With a grin, Hiyori retorts, \u201cBecause we\u2019re too fat?\u201d (Fat jokes are, according to the film, a common fixture in sumo wrestling\u2014as the women board their flight to Taiwan, one of them deadpans, \u201cI\u2019m scared the plane might crash because we\u2019re too heavy.\u201d)\n\n\u201c Boys can aspire to be professional wrestlers. They can easily see a future in sumo. \u201d \u2014 Hiyori Kon\n\nThe fight against sexism in sumo wrestling came to a climactic head last year when the mayor of a town outside of Kyoto collapsed in the ring at a local tournament. As several female EMTs rushed to offer him medical aid, the referee demanded they leave the ring and after they left, administrators sprinkled \u201cpurifying\u201d salt on the ground. The incident sparked a widespread debate about the oppressive and archaic devotion to upholding the sexist ban.\n\nWhen Hiyori makes it to the final round of the world championships, her Russian opponent appears to stand at least a full foot taller than her. It does not look good for our heroine. Hiyori is brought to the floor after a particularly heated struggle. Wiping tears from her eyes with a pink striped towel, she says, \u201cEven if you\u2019ve worked so hard, for so long, you can lose in a flash.\u201d But for Hiyori, it was never about winning. \u201cI believe that as a result of my hard work,\u201d she concludes, \u201cwomen\u2019s sumo will stop facing discrimination. I will continue to strive for it with that belief.\u201d", "description": "Hiyori Kon, the subject of the new Netflix documentary short \u2018Little Miss Sumo,\u2019 is fighting for gender equality.
