Yolando Solano, who was shot and survived, testified Tuesday that God told her to 'play dead' if she wanted to survive\n\nA survivor of a shooting in Missouri has described her ordeal at the triple-murder trial of Demetrius 'Meechie' Davis.\n\nYolanda Solano, 51, survived the shooting spree April 25, 2018 that killed her boyfriend, son and neighborhood friend at her home in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nDavis, 28, is charged with three counts of first-degree murder and Solano, who was wounded, took the stand Tuesday.\n\nSolano said: 'After he shot me the first time, God said to me, \"Drop dead and play dead because that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to get out.\"'\n\nAfter killing Solano\u2019s boyfriend Brandon Stephenson, 36, her son Timothy Solano, 20 and Melissa Tierney, 40, a neighborhood friend, Davis found Solano coming out of the bathroom and shot her, too, assistant prosecutor Tom Dittmeier said.\n\n'I dropped to the floor,' Solano said. 'I didn\u2019t breathe. I didn\u2019t move, and just laid there bleeding. I thought I was going to die.'\n\nWhile on the bathroom floor, Solano said she heard Davis say 'I got them all,' as he walked out of the house, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said.\n\n'I thought Demetrius and I were friends,' Solano told jurors. 'I don\u2019t think he cares at all that he shot me.'\n\nTriple-homicide survivor Yolanda Solano testified Tuesday that she 'dropped to the floor' after being shot in April 2018. 'I didn't breathe. I didn't move'\n\nThe home in St. Louis, Missouri where a three people were killed in an April 2018 spree is pictured. One witness and survivor told jurors 'I thought I was going to die'\n\nHer brother hid in his bedroom and was not injured.\n\nSolano, who suffered wounds to her hands and face, explained to the jury that she escaped through a bedroom window, stumbling to a next door neighbor for assistance, as she left a trial of blood in her wake.\n\nAccording to her testimony, Solano said the shootings were the result of an arsenal of rifles in her home that had been stolen a week earlier from another home.\n\nDavis was 'was supposed to middleman those guns,' Solano said, as a plan to sell off the weapons.\n\nBut Davis\u2019 defense lawyer, Nick Zotos, told jurors there\u2019s no physical evidence connecting Davis to the shooting scene and no murder weapon.\n\nHe also spent time discrediting Solano, focusing on her long addiction to painkillers and heroin.\n\nTimothy Solano, was among three murder victims at a St. Louis, Missouri home in 2018. His mother Yolanda Solando survived the shooting and testified at the trial of Demetrius Davis\n\nShe had acknowledged prison time in Idaho for drugs and overdosing on heroin twice this year, the Post-Dispatch said.\n\n'I\u2019ve probably tried every drug there is,' she said, adding that she has been sober for 52 days.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Solano told jurors she hadn\u2019t used heroin at least two days and was having withdrawal symptoms.\n\nZotos accused her of lying - saying she was high and unable to recall clearly.\n\n'I am being truthful, and I know who shot me,' she said.\n\nThe Assistant Prosecutor Dittmeier calls the crime, 'a tale of betrayal and coldblooded execution.'", "description": "The murder trial of Demetrius 'Meechie' Davis, 28, is underway in St. Louis County.
