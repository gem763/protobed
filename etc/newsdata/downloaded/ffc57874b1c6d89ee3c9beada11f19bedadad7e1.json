And here\u2019s the rub.\n\nIn his musical, composer Lin-Manuel Miranda briskly glosses over Hamilton\u2019s early years in the Caribbean and hastens to America, where he became a confidant of George Washington, helped shape the US Constitution and supported the fight to abolish slavery.\n\nThat support has now been judged by some prominent historians to be half-hearted. A similar shadow hangs over Nevis\u2019s other heroic connection: Nelson.\n\nThe first great popular British hero met his wife Fanny Nisbet on Nevis and married her near the Montpelier Plantation Inn, now a luxury hotel once visited by Princess Diana.\n\nDowntown Charlestown, the capital of Nevis. It is the birthplace of Alexander Hamilton\n\nNelson, it has been discovered, was an ardent supporter of slavery. And Nelson\u2019s marriage to Fanny was as storm-tossed as Charles and Diana\u2019s proved to be.\n\nCrown Princess offered a wide range of intriguing excursions at all the islands we visited.\n\nIn St Lucia we enjoyed a Segway Safari on a forest path with stunning island views.\n\nIn Antigua we were whisked away to a private beach where we swam in the blood-warm sea and had lunch in a lively beach restaurant.\n\nOn Barbados there is the chance to swim with turtles, while in St Thomas we could have swum with sea lions.\n\nBack to nature: Swimming with sea turtles in Barbados\n\nCruise companies cater to different sectors of the market. Small-ship cruises generally have more thoughtful itineraries and better food. But you can enjoy small-ship-style service on some bigger vessels.\n\nOn the Crown Princess you can pay a little extra and relax in the utmost calm and comfort of the Sanctuary, which sits above the ship\u2019s excellent spa.\n\nAlso elevated to smaller-ship levels was the food at the main restaurants, which offer lots of healthy and low-fat options.\n\nBut most striking about this cruise experience was the staff. I can put hand on heart and say that they were the most efficient and kindest I\u2019ve met \u2013 they could hold their own on cruises that cost five times as much.", "description": "Frank Barrett joined a sailing from Fort Lauderdale and stopped off at St Kitts and Nevis, the latter being the birthplace of Alexander Hamilton.
