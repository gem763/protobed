Last time he was in the ED someone threw acid over his car, so he\u2019s understandably reluctant to come to Holby. He\u2019s convinced he\u2019s still in danger and someone is out to get him.\n\nOf course we know that it was Archie who threw the acid, so despite Will (Jack Nolan)\u2019s efforts to get rid of any CCTV evidence she can\u2019t help worrying. If Millbank works out it was her who attacked his car, her career could be over. As Millbank becomes increasingly paranoid, is Archie about to get into serious trouble?\n\nMeanwhile, Ethan (George Rainsford) gets a visit from Effie\u2019s dad Theo (Jim Sturgeon). After previously warning Ethan to stay away from his daughter, Theo now wants his help to find out whether Effie is in the trial group that gets the experimental treatment, or the placebo group. Ethan knows it would be incredibly unethical to do as Theo asks \u2013 but his old friend is desperate enough to try a spot of blackmail, reminding Ethan that he hasn\u2019t been entirely professional in his dealings with Effie so far. How will Ethan react?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Rash (Neet Mohan) is angry that Mason (Victor Oshin) hasn\u2019t talked to Ethan about the D-dimer mistake he made recently. There\u2019s even worse to come when he uncovers other mistakes Mason has let Rash take the blame for. Once again the two of them have to work together on a case. Is this Mason\u2019s opportunity to make amends for his behaviour, or will Mason go to even greater lengths to cover his tracks?\n\nSue Haasler is the author of five novels and the official BBC Holby City book, which you can read about here.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Worrying times ahead for Archie.", "authors": ["Sue Haasler"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/archie-casualty-9-d9cf_1571152600.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
