It\u2019s pathetic.\u2019\n\nMegan was in a relationship with Aaron for two and a half years\n\nShe added: \u2018What if I had died? It\u2019s like my life is only worth a couple of months.\u2019\n\nWorthington was convicted of a Section 20 GBH offence, which carries the lowest maximum sentence of the two GBH charges.\n\nHis early release is partly due to the time he spent on remand, between his arrest on January 1 and sentencing on June 28.\n\nThe MoJ also said a prisoner on an HDC is automatically freed half-way through their sentence, but a prison governor can release them up to 135 days before this date.\n\nRemembering the brutal attack at their home in Chorley, Lancashire, Megan said: \u2018It was 5am on New Year\u2019s Day and we\u2019d been drinking.\n\n\u2018He hit me once and I kicked him. He hit me again and it all went black.\n\n\u2018Then I woke up and he wouldn\u2019t get me an ambulance, he was calling me \u201cdramatic\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Then my neighbour came round and called one. It turned out I had a bleed on the brain and had hours on my life.\u2019\n\nMegan says her brain injuries affect \u2018every aspect\u2019 of her life.\n\nShe said: \u2018Sometimes when I\u2019m talking I\u2019ll forget what I was saying. I can\u2019t smell like I used to or taste.\n\nMegan said the justice system is \u2018an absolute joke\u2019 (Picture: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018The doctors said my senses will never come back but hopefully they will.\n\n\u2018I have a massive scar all the way from the right side of my head down to the back. You can see the stitches in my pictures.\n\n\u2018It makes you stronger going through something like this but I\u2019m so lucky, if it was a few centimetres deeper I could have just died.\n\n\u2018The surgeons told me the force of it was worse than injuries people get in car crashes.\u2019\n\n\u2018I did have some complications at the beginning. I couldn\u2019t walk for a while, but I built up my strength quite well because of my age.\n\n\u2018I still have pains. I\u2019ve lost vision in my right eye. Everything is affected. When I do too much I feel the pressure and the screws in my head. They stick out.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have a human head anymore and I never will.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMegan was 16 when she met Worthington and they were in a relationship for two and a half years.\n\nIt didn\u2019t start out violent but within a year, smacks started turning into punches.\n\nShe said she knew he was manipulating her, but she felt \u2018trapped\u2019 at the time.\n\nShe said: \u2018When I was in that relationship, I was so weak, I cried every single day. I never had any confidence.\n\n\u2018But now that he\u2019s not here, I\u2019m unbreakable. I don\u2019t cry, nothing bothers me.\u2019\n\nAn MoJ spokesperson said: \u2018We want all victims to have confidence in the justice system and we understand the distress caused when an attacker is released early.\n\n\u2018While decisions to release a prisoner on home detention curfew are a matter for individual governors, everyone is electronically tagged and subject to strict licence conditions.\n\n\u2018These include an overnight curfew and exclusion zones that prevent them going near their victims. If these restrictions are breached they face a return to prison.\u2019\n\nNeed support?
