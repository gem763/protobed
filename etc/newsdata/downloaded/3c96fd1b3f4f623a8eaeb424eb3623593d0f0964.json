As I said, there is no allegation against me, I've not done anything wrong. These allegations, let's be clear here, are about Alberto Salazar,\" Farah said.\n\n\"There are no allegations against Mo Farah for any wrongdoing.\"\n\nFarah insisted he was clean, adding \"I can't win whatever I do.\"\n\n\"I'm probably one of the most tested athletes in the world,\" he said. \"I get tested all the time and I'm happy to be tested anytime, anywhere and for my samples to be used for whatever they need to do.\n\n\"Keep it and freeze it, there is not much more I can do.\"\n\nFarah refused to answer directly when was asked several times whether he was disappointed in his former coach.\n\nHe added his success comes from hard work and maturity and not from performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n\"(Don't) try and take away what I have earned from hard work .... I have learned to win races and control races,\" he said.\n\nUS distance runners Galen Rupp and Jordan Hasay were also coached by Salazar until last Monday.\n\nRupp said he has not communicated with Salazar since the ban but is supporting his former coach.\n\n\"I understand that it's under appeal and I support him in that appeal,\" Rupp told reporters.\n\nAs for Hasay, she also has not had any contact with Salazar since the ban but missed his positivity.\n\n\"It's hard because he's very, very close to me. Usually the last few weeks before the marathon are fun because he starts getting anxious and starts calling three times a day about 'You should bring your grey socks instead of white socks' or this or that.\n\n\"Just little stuff. Just in the sense of having that mentor and that friendship and those last moments of advice and excitement before the race, that's been tough. I really miss that,\" Hasay said.\n\nShe added that she had no knowledge of any wrongdoing by Salazar.\n\n\"I've never been offered anything or seen anything and if that were to happen I would have left long ago,\" Hasay said.", "description": "A defiant Mo Farah angrily hit back at critics, saying he was never given any banned drugs while a member of the Nike Oregon Project.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8785/6462a220b3c1481c90782b267ec6bc89.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
