I can't explain it any better than that.\n\n'He is a serving police officer with three years service. Up to now he has had a spotless record, a clean licence and no previous convictions.\n\n'He spotted the cyclist and the intention was to overtake and give plenty of room. His focus was on the primary hazard - the cyclist - and for some reason he did not see the oncoming hazard.\n\n'Even police officers can make mistakes. It has not affected his career. He has undertaken a driving refresher course and been given certain re-training by the police.\n\n'Mr Chance is understandably rather embarrassed by this and wants to deal with it as quickly as possible. He is aware points on his licence are inevitable.'\n\nSheriff William Wood told Chance: 'It is arguably at the higher end of the range of careless driving, with it being a lit traffic light.\n\n'I take into account the accused's employment in the public service, his previous good character and clean driving licence, and will deal with it without disqualifying him.'\n\nChance admitted driving carelessly and was fined \u00a3600 and had six penalty points added to his licence (pictured, the Peugeot 308 after it crashed into traffic lights)\n\nA Police Scotland spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the outcome of the case and a report will be made to Deputy Chief Constable for People and Professionalism Fiona Taylor for consideration of misconduct proceedings.'\n\nThey declined to confirm the cost of damage to the police car.\n\nLast year, the same court heard how PC Chance and a colleague turned up to deal with a suspected robbery - and ended up being locked in the gunman's home as he fled.\n\nRobert Lambert, 62, lured the officers to his flat with a bogus robbery claim and then pulled a weapon and cornered them at gunpoint.\n\nThey fled into Lambert's flat and locked themselves in as they feared they were about to be shot in the common close of the Perth city centre flat.\n\nFiscal depute Vicki Bell said: 'He was holding a firearm in both hands with his arms extended and raised to shoulder height. He was pointing the firearm directly at them.\n\n'The firearm had the appearance of a handgun. Believing the firearm to be real the officers sought refuge within the home address of the accused, closed the door and locked it.'\n\nA senior police source said: 'Mark has only been in the force for about three years and has not exactly made what you would call an illustrious start.\n\n'There was speculation he was shouting to his colleague on the bike because he recognised him as he was going past and that's what distracted him.\n\n'However, he wasn't charged specifically with anything like that, so that must not have been the case. It's hard to know how to explain it.'", "description": "PC Mark Chance, 25, caused thousands of pound of damage when he smashed into the lights in central Perth, Scotland on May 1 this year.
