For me, that's probably the weakest part of their offense is him. Everything else is good. They've got a good running game, probably one of the best in the league. They've got real good receivers. You just want them to pass the ball. You want Kirk Cousins to get it in his hands.\"\n\nAlthough the 31-year-old Michigan State product has completed 68.3 percent of his throws in five games this season, he's accumulated just 1,041 yards with five touchdowns and two interceptions. He ranks 28th out of 33 qualified quarterbacks in ESPN's Total QBR.\n\nCousins' inability to create big plays in the passing game is a key reason for the team's up-and-down 3-2 start to the 2019 season. Some have speculated it is a factor in the displeasure of receiver Stefon Diggs, who has been fined over $200,000 for missing practice and meetings.\n\nCousins, a 2016 Pro Bowl selection, told reporters last week he's still confident in his ability:\n\n\"My confidence is strong. I think I'm trying to be self-aware \u2026 and be honest and say, 'Hey, when I mess up, I'm going to own it and point to it.'\n\n\"On the flip side, I'm not going to go up there and say, 'I'm awesome!' So when we have a good play, I'm not going to tell you about it. Sometimes, it can be one-sided. I've played a lot of football in this league, and I think you take confidence from the fact that I've been through this before. It's not my first rodeo being in a tough game, a tough loss. You just move forward with confidence.\"\n\nThe Vikings' aerial attack struggles\u2014they rank 29th in passing yards per game\u2014are made more frustrating by the number of playmakers within the unit.\n\nAlong with Diggs and Adam Thielen, one of the NFL's best receiving duos, Minnesota also features two capable tight ends in Kyle Rudolph and Irv Smith Jr. As well, running back Dalvin Cook is among the league's best at making plays out of the backfield in the passing game.\n\nCousins must play better if the Vikings are going to move into Super Bowl contention, so it's hard to argue with Brown's stance heading into the teams' Week 6 clash.", "description": "Philadelphia Eagles  linebacker  Zach Brown  said Friday that finding success against the  Minnesota Vikings  offense Sunday will come down to forcing quarterback Kirk Cousins to throw the ball...", "authors": ["Tim Daniels"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/832/584/hi-res-b018c0f5b98ed16164a6b893cb586fbc_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
