The feminist group previously released a statement on why they invited Murphy to speak, saying 'she is respected as an important feminist voice, not only in Canada, but around the world.\n\n'She has built one of the largest and most read feminist websites in the English speaking world, and has exemplified bravery and steadfastness in her refusal to back down on behalf of women.'\n\nAs she spoke, demonstrators aligned with Pride Toronto and others who felt Murphy was offensive to LGBT communities gathered outside the library\n\nThe statement added: 'We are not a hate group, and we do not espouse hate speech, or advocate for the removal of rights from any marginalized group.'\n\nThe library came under intense scrutiny for giving the event the green light.\n\nCity librarian Vickery Bowles released a statement earlier this month defending the library's decision and saying that it has 'an obligation to protect free speech'.\n\nBowles added that the library supports the LGBT community and would cancel any event that it believes would be promoting 'discrimination, contempt or hatred for any individual or group.'\n\nThe decision to hold the event faced intense backlash. Toronto Mayor John Tory even weighed in on the debate, saying he was 'disappointed' that the event had gone ahead.\n\nAn online petition calling for the cancellation of the talk had accrued more than 8,000 signatures by Tuesday.\n\nPride Toronto said in a statement that Murphy's views are 'a denial of the lives, experiences and identities of trans people.'", "description": "Writer Meghan Murphy who was put forward controversial opinions on transgender rights was met with hundreds of protesters as she gave a speech at Toronto Public Library on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/20375024-0-image-a-93_1572439591418.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
