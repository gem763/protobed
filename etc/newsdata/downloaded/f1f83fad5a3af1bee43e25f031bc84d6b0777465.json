Sanders, long a champion of a government guaranteed health care system, has said that he plans to raise taxes, including on the middle class, to pay for his plan. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills,\u201d he said at this week\u2019s debate in Westerville, Ohio. \u201cBut I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.\u201d\n\nWarren has not made such an acknowledgment, arguing that the framing of the question ignores that overall costs for the middle class will go down as they do not have to pay for premiums. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d she said at the debate this week.\n\nDemocratic presidential rivals such as former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar have been especially critical of Warren\u2019s answers as she has risen in the polls, taking direct at her in the recent debate and in the days afterward.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d Klobuchar said at the debate. \u201cAnd I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.\u201d\n\nAfter Warren announced that a plan for funding was coming soon, Biden\u2019s campaign signaled that the feud was far from over. \u201cIt's mystifying that for someone who has put having a plan for everything at the center of her pitch to voters, Senator Warren has decided to release a health care plan only after enduring immense public pressure for refusing to do so,\u201d said TJ Ducklo, the Biden campaign\u2019s national press secretary.\n\n\u201cWe hope her plan will be straight with the American people about how much middle class taxes will go up to pay for the $30+ trillion it will take to fund Medicare for All.\u201d\n\nAlice Ollstein contributed to this report", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6a/48/bb80459344d89862dd5e2c4e584b/20191020-warren-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
