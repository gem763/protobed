But this older queen is more introspective than the one played by Claire Foy in the first two seasons.\n\n\u201cOn days like today, ask yourself: In the time I\u2019ve been on the throne, what have I actually achieved?\u201d she says.\n\nNot only is the world around the royals rapidly shifting \u2014 their private lives are too.\n\nDes Willie/Netflix Princess Margaret (Helena Bonham Carter) dances with Antony Armstrong-Jones (Ben Daniels).\n\nAlthough Princess Margaret (Helena Bonham Carter) is still coping with her place in the royal family (like Vanessa Kirby\u2019s Princess Margaret did in previous seasons), her marriage to photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones (Ben Daniels) is beginning to unravel. And a quick shot of Princess Margaret in a bathtub with a tiara on \u2014 a reference to a famous photo Armstrong-Jones took of her \u2014 hints that viewers will get an intimate look at the highs and lows of this couple\u2019s turbulent relationship.\n\nAudiences also get to see an adult Prince Charles (Josh O\u2019Connor) as he contemplates his future within the royal family after taking a romantic interest in a woman named Camilla Shand (Emerald Fennell).\n\nTo see all the tea that will be spilled in the next season \u2014 which premieres on Netflix Nov. 17 \u2014 check out the trailer above.
