Bench: Marler, Cowan- Dickie, Genge, Lawes, Wilson, Heinz, Joseph, Cokanasiga\n\nEngland's World Cup starts in earnest against the Pumas and an inexperienced coach, in the knowledge that England will need to step up a few gears, might be tempted to crank it up in training and perhaps overcook it. Eddie won't do that.\n\nHe will have seen that England were where they needed to be physically and mentally against Tonga and the US. The more I reflect on those games the more impressed I am. England were strong, efficient and ruthless and there have been few distractions.\n\nAnd Eddie will trust the players. This might be England's youngest ever World Cup squad, but the key players have a lot of miles on the clock. There is nothing at club level that the Saracens players, for example, haven't experienced.\n\nMako Vunipola should be allowed to do the job he is capable of if the prop forward is fit\n\nThe point is they won't have to be told how big this match is. What defines very good players is that they personally take on the responsibility of bringing their 'A' game to proceedings when the stakes are highest.\n\nAs for selections, England will essentially use the starting lineup against Tonga as their template and just tinker a bit.\n\nMy gut reaction after the US game was to ask Joe Marler to go again but I have slept on that and changed my mind. If Mako Vunipola is fully fit, I would now look to start him.\n\nLet Mako do the job he is capable of and then bring Marler on. It might mean a shorter shift than normal for Mako, with Marler coming on just before half-time, but that is the logical way forward.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: It is not often you get a full nineday lay-off in tournament rugby these days and using this period to optimum effect is important for Eddie Jones and England.", "authors": ["Sir Clive Woodward For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/28/22/19055200-0-image-a-6_1569706061511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
