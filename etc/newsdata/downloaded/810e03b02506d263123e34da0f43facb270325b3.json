He said a Turkish military operation against the US-backed Kurdish forces could begin \"maybe today, maybe tomorrow\".\n\nThe Turkish military has been dispatching units and defense equipment to southeastern Sanliurfa province in the past month. Mr Erdogan had expressed frustration, threatening a unilateral operation, but this was his most specific threat amid concerns from the Syrian Kurds of a limited military operation.\n\n\"We have given all kinds of warning regarding the (area) east of the Euphrates to the relevant parties. We have acted with enough patience,\" Mr Erdogan said.\n\nA Turkish military operation, however limited, would put major pressure on the more 1,000 US troops in northeastern Syria and who operate closely with the Kurdish-led forces, whether to implement the security mechanism or in fighting IS.\n\nThe Turkish leader has repeatedly expressed frustration with Washington's support for Kurdish groups in Syria. His threats continued despite a deal reached with Washington in August to carry out joint patrols and move Syrian Kurdish fighters away from the border.", "description": "Turkey's president, in his strongest warning yet, threatened on Saturday to launch a military operation into northeastern Syria, where US troops are deployed and have been trying to defuse tensions between Washington's two allies - Turkey and the Syrian Kurds.", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff", "David Trimble", "Roderick Crawford", "Stephen Barclay"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/01/TELEMMGLPICT000193011644-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
