Trump, in turn, has consistently sought to strengthen the perception that America is in chaos, a perception that has enhanced his support while seeming to reinforce his claim that his predecessors, especially President Barack Obama, were failures.\n\nPetersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux find that those who meet their definition of having a \u201cneed for chaos\u201d express that need by willingly spreading disinformation. Their goal is not to advance their own ideology but to undermine political elites, left and right, and to \u201cmobilize others against politicians in general.\u201d These disrupters do not \u201cshare rumors because they believe them to be true. For the core group, hostile political rumors are simply a tool to create havoc.\u201d\n\nIn the past, chaos-seekers were on outer edges of politics, unable to exercise influence. Contemporary social media \u2014 Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and so on \u2014 has empowered this constituency, providing a bullhorn to disseminate false news, conspiracy theories and allegations of scandal to a broad audience. Examples include the lunacy of the Comet Pizza story (a.k.a. Pizzagate), the various anti-Obama birther conspiracies and Alex Jones\u2019s claim that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 20 children dead was a \u201ccomplete fake\u201d staged by the government to promote gun control.", "description": "", "authors": ["Thomas Edsall", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Voters-Chaos.Html"], "top_image": ""}
