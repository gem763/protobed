His reaction to the attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities a the weekend swung quickly from a warning that the US is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to the remark that \u201cI don\u2019t want war with anybody\u201d and that \u201cat some point it will work out\u201d. Though his secretary of state blamed Iran point blank, the president has said Washington wants more proof. He has already backed off one planned strike, in June.\n\nYet he could still swing in another direction. While his keenness to avoid getting embroiled in a conflict is evident, especially with his campaign for a second term well under way, he is a volatile and ignorant man in a chaotic and fractious administration, facing a crisis in which the stakes rise by the month. The assault on the Abqaiq petroleum processing plant, whether by drone or missile, which knocked out half the kingdom\u2019s production and caused the biggest spike in oil prices since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait three decades ago, has greatly increased the risks of war.\n\nIran insists it is not responsible, and the Houthi rebels it backs against the Saudi-led coalition in the devastating war in Yemen have claimed it as their triumph. No party to this situation can be regarded as a candid witness. But even if the Houthis carried it out, no one believes they would have been able to pull off such a sophisticated attack without the Iranian support they have received.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s early tweet implied that he was outsourcing US foreign policy to Riyadh \u2013 which was initially more cautious about attributing blame to Iran than Mike Pompeo, despite the bellicose character of its crown prince. Plausible deniability can be useful to targets as well as perpetrators, particularly when they have limited options for responding. Without retaliation, Riyadh fears further attacks, and the ruination of the long-awaited flotation of the state oil company Aramco, on which the crown prince\u2019s ambitious plans to overhaul the Saudi economy depend. But it understands that there are not many ways of doing so without risking a conflagration. Even if a potential measured response was identified \u2013 perhaps a cyber-attack on Iranian facilities, for which no one claims responsibility \u2013 it would be harder to effect when Mr Trump sees discretion as an absurdity and demands personal glory at every turn.\n\nIran looks alarmingly confident that he will shy away from military action even as the stakes rise, and has been keen to demonstrate that its people will not be the only ones to suffer thanks to the US stranglehold on its economy. Maximum pressure was supposed to bring it to heel; instead, it has increased Iran\u2019s aggression, because it has so little left to lose. Strikingly, the United Arab Emirates has stepped back somewhat from the confrontation with Iran following attacks on ships leaving its ports. Meanwhile, Europe, led by France, has increased its attempts to de-escalate. Yet that initiative can only succeed if the US is willing to bring Iran back to the table by loosening the economic chokehold. The scale and effectiveness of the weekend\u2019s attack has made that less likely in the short term at least \u2013 and lessened the prospect of a post-Trump president returning to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or agreeing to a similar one.\n\nMr Trump complained that the agreement focused on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme but did not address its missile development, human rights abuses and sponsorship of militias. Even were his claims taken at face value, which they should not be, the point is that the nuclear deal was achievable and important in its own right. Walking out of it has made it harder to deal with every other matter. The region risks stumbling into war \u2013 as these latest events have so clearly shown.", "description": "Editorial: The attack on a key oil facility has increased the dangers \u2013 but US actions triggered this crisis", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3f6c5091ec99b1e440bae734f9a30ab9915f61/94_0_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a89000cdc829a7ba16d4311cf16663d2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
