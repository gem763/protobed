John Hibbard, then in his late twenties, had sailed out to Rottnest Island, off Perth, Western Australia, and was windsurfing the best waves of his life in Stark Bay. The sun smiled down on him out of a clear blue sky and a 20-knot wind and 10ft swell propelled him across wave after immaculate wave. Finally satisfied and exhausted, knocking back an ice-cold Corona, he realised it could never get better than this. But the thought occurred to him: what am I going to do with the rest of my life? The answer to that question was Red Paddle Co, of which he is co-founder and CEO.\n\nWe had a plan, John Hibbard and I, to take out a couple of his stand-up paddleboards (or SUPs) and ride them along the River Dart in Devon, stop somewhere for lunch and paddle back. It would have been idyllic. The only problem was that it was pelting with rain all day, which put a bit of a dampener on the idea. But at least he had more time to show me around his dedicated new headquarters near Totnes on the south coast with a view out over Dartmoor.\n\nHibbard was British windsurfing champion in 2008. He was born in Basingstoke but brought up in Devon. He windsurfed around the world, from Maui to Tahiti, from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, sponsored by Nissan and Fat Face, and getting photographed while doing it. He loved the technical challenge, mastering the equipment, no matter how gnarly the conditions. It sounds like the dream life. And it was, but there were a couple of downsides. One was that it was lonely: his only friends were also his rivals so he couldn\u2019t hang out with them. The other was the sheer amount of kit. Hibbard recalls once checking in 50 bags at an airport (admittedly he was carrying stuff for a friend too).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAfter becoming British champion, and sustaining various injuries along the way, he was looking for something new. \u201cI thought there must be more to life on the beach.\u201d Then one day he was doing a photoshoot in Harlyn Bay and there was no wind and he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got this paddleboard thing in the back of the car.\u201d A friend had told him about it but he\u2019d never tried it before. He paddled out and caught a wave and rode it all the way to the beach. The shot made a double-page spread in the magazines. He had found the solution, not just for the lack of wind, but of what to do with his life.\n\nHe took the board out on a river and he realised two things: one, that it was easy for someone who had never been on a board before to pick it up \u2013 it didn\u2019t need the kind of dedication required by surfing or windsurfing. And secondly that it opened up a totally different perspective on the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d lived around that river for years, but I\u2019d never been up it before,\u201d he says. \u201cI was seeing things I\u2019d never seen before. So many trees, a kiln, an old pub. And standing up you have a better view than from a kayak.\u201d He had been all around the world but all he ever saw was beaches and airports. With the paddleboard you didn\u2019t need wind and you didn\u2019t need waves. This was \u201cthe bicycle of the water\u201d \u2013 the ideal leisure craft of the future. And it was sociable: you could go out with friends, you weren\u2019t competing for wave of the day. It wasn\u2019t extreme, but it was an experience.\n\nStand-up paddleboard originated in Hawaii. For hundred of years people had been standing on boards and using paddle power to punt them from island to island. Then Laird Hamilton, big-wave surfer extraordinaire, based in Maui, adopted and glamorised them in the early Noughties. Hollywood stars could be seen riding them on the west coast. But the reality is that they were huge, unwieldy, and vulnerable to dings.\n\nHibbard, fired up with enthusiasm, first of all tried his hand at selling them around the country. But it was, as he says wryly, \u201ca slow burn\u201d. Windsurfing shops had shrunk in size along with windsurfing boards and sails and they didn\u2019t have the space for these bigger ones. By chance, Hibbard came across an inflatable board, made in South Korea for an American company, and he realised that this was the future.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Korean manufacturer made him a board but it wasn\u2019t great. For one thing Hibbard was too out of breath after pumping it up to come out with a decent sales spiel. And for another the board itself was too spongy, more like an airbed or a lilo than a proper board. \u201cIt was a great idea but badly executed,\u201d he says. Which is what inspired him to come up with his new mission statement: it has to be authentic. Without compromise. The board has to be a real board.\n\nHibbard asked an old friend of his, a surfer and animator, to design him a logo. His designer friend told him that he needed a name before he could have a logo. He realised that he\u2019d done everything but he still didn\u2019t have a name for the company. They were sitting on the beach in Woolacombe watching the sun go down and Hibbard looked into the sunset and said, \u201cThere it is: red \u2013 red sky at night.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Everything collapses down so that it\u2019s portable and it all goes in a custom-designed bag (wheels or backpack). The pump is now double-barrelled and takes half the time with half the effort. And when the board is inflated there\u2019s a patented stiffening system to make it as rigid as the old foam and fibre glass but even more robust with a double skin and dimpled surface. I inspected their boards and I can confirm \u2013 having paddleboarded in Hawaii \u2013 they look and feel like real boards. They don\u2019t bend. (Check out YouTube, where they have a 22-ton JCB grinding over one with no ill effects.) Everything is designed and engineered by Red and produced in house, using a 3D printer for the smallest parts.\n\nNow they\u2019re exporting thousands of boards to 60 countries around the world \u2013 selling them even in Hawaii, which feels like carrying coals to Newcastle. \u201cCustomers do the selling for us,\u201d says Hibbard. And there is a blind paddleboarder called Dean Dunbar in Scotland riding a Red paddleboard. Mission accomplished.\n\nJohn Hibbard had one stroke of genius. When he took people out on an SUP for the first time they fell in love with it but then they would say, pointing at the nose, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d And he would say, \u201cThat\u2019s the valve.\u201d And they would go (with an air of deflation), \u201cOh, really?\u201d So he simply moved the valve from the front of the board to the back. Now nobody even notices it\u2019s inflatable. Until he shows them. And they go, \u201cWow, I don\u2019t believe it!", "description": "It was one of those perfect days.
