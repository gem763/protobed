Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for not providing a full explanation for her Medicare for All plan at Tuesday night's Democratic presidential primary debate.\n\nButtigieg, who was positioned right next to Warren during the CNN debate, directly confronted Warren on the issue, asking, \"I don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everybody is to obliterate private plans?\"\n\nDuring his interview with CNN on Wednesday, Buttigieg said she was \"more forthcoming\" about the number of pictures she has taken with her supporters than her Medicare For All plan.\"\n\n\"I have a lot of respect for Senator Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she\u2019s taken than about how this plan is going to be funded,\" the South Bend, Ind. mayor said. \"And that\u2019s a real problem, especially when there\u2019s a better way to deliver health care coverage to everybody.\" (emphasis added)\n\nButtigieg explained many Americans want to keep their private health insurance plans, which is why his proposal would a be voluntary.\n\n\"And I think that\u2019s the right answer, especially when you do the math and realize it\u2019s also an answer that is paid for, unlike the Medicare for All, whether you want it or not plans, that still have this giant question mark over how it\u2019s supposes to work,\" he said.\n\nWarren defended her idea during the debate by saying costs will only go up for the wealthy and large businesses. She added that she will not sign a bill that would raise costs on middle class families.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/16/2019 16:50:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/289/fb270aa9-e701-4d95-9db2-2166fd895c9c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
