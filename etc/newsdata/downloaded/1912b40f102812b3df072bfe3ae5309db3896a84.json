The match was stopped twice and a third time would have meant it being abandoned.\n\nBut skipper Kane questioned whether that system is the answer.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is an announcement and two or three steps before players go off.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable to be racist once so I feel there can be stronger punishments.\u201d\n\nAnti-racism network Fare executive director Piara Powar said there was no shortage of evidence to have a \u201clegally safe prosecution of the Bulgarians\u201d over the disgusting behaviour of fans.\n\nSports Minister Nigel Adams has written to UEFA urging it to act \u201cswiftly\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen international problems like this arise, we have to speak up, we have to demand action.\u201d\n\n(Image: VASSIL DONEV/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nShadow Sports Minister Rosena Allin-Khan urged Uefa to consider booting Bulgaria out of the qualifying competition. She said the scenes were \u201cutterly, utterly deplorable\u201d.\n\nBut UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin stressed football associations cannot solve the issues alone.\n\nHe said: \u201cOnly by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress.\u201d\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate stressed English football also had to tackle racism.\n\nFIFA said \u201cWe may extend worldwide any sanctions that a Confederation or Member Association imposes for racist incidents, such as those which occurred in Sofia during the UEFA EURO 2020 qualifier match between Bulgaria and England.\u201d\n\nThe Mirror is campaigning to Boot Out Racism from football.\n\nFar-right thugs have been stain on game for 25 years\n\nThe neo-Nazi thugs who subjected England stars to a torrent of racist abuse have been a vile stain on \u00adBulgarian football for 25 years.\n\nYet despite their history of violence, they were still allowed into a national stadium to peddle their hate, in front of millions of TV viewers around the world.\n\nAnd campaigners have accused Bulgarian football chiefs of doing nothing to halt their game\u2019s far-right infiltration.\n\nWitnesses even claimed stewards were spotted removing their bibs before joining the thugs in their sick abuse of England\u2019s black players during Monday night\u2019s 6-0 drubbing of Bulgaria.\n\nCalling themselves the Usual Suspects, the cowardly 50-strong Lauta Army mob arrived at Sofia\u2019s Vasil Levski stadium on Monday night with only one thing in mind \u2013 boosting their sick notoriety.\n\nAnd one Bulgaria player told how they deliberately abused Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford and Tyrone Mings with monkey taunts and Nazi salutes in a bid to get the match abandoned.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBut the stars bravely continued, after two \u00adstoppages, to thump their opponents six nil in the Euro 2020 qualifier. England fans also revealed they were ambushed by yobs.\n\nBolton supporter Theo Ogden, 18, from London, said: \u201cAs we walked into the dark streets away from the security of the stadium we realised the Ultras were waiting for us.\n\n\u201cThey were dressed in black like the yobs we\u2019d seen doing Nazi salutes. A group came close to us then more appeared and we \u00adrealised they were trying to head us off and we braced ourself for a kicking. It was terrifying.\u201d\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nTheo and his friends were only saved when a police car came to their rescue.\n\nThe Lauta Army, who follow Bulgarian team Lokomotiv Plovdiv, is no secret \u00adorganisations. It is so open about its violence and \u00adneo-Nazi ideals it has its own Facebook page, where brawls with other hooligans are planned.\n\nThe mob even claimed it had \u00adorganised a battle with Three Lions fans in Sofia.\n\nIn the hours before the game, the Lauta Army posted a photo with the message: \u2018In Sofia before Bulgaria - England after the arranged meeting with two English clubs didn\u2019t happen as the English didn\u2019t stick to the agreement and turned their phones off. Some English decided to fight between themselves.\u201d\n\nThe poster appeared alongside bare-chested images of their \u201cfighters\u201d arriving for games. YouTube footage showed the Lauta army clashing with supporters of Lokomotiv Plovdiv\u2019s fierce rivals Botev, wearing hoods and performing Nazi salutes.\n\nTheir banner was again on show in front of a section of Bulgarian fans where Monday\u2019s offensive chanting took place.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOn Lauta\u2019s Facebook page it has a post of Donald Trump wearing a one of its jackets with the message: \u201cWe don\u2019t like immigrants either.\u201d Other images showed thugs lined up, dressed in black, in \u201cteam\u201d photos, with their faces blanked out as they do Nazi salutes.\n\nThe thugs are so notorious they were escorted into the stadium by police. They were removed after the abuse and match stoppages.\n\nThe Levski arena already had 5,000 empty seats as a punishment for previous racist chanting.\n\nBut Fare, an umbrella organisation that fights inequality in football, insisted Bulgarian football bosses are not listening to its concerns.\n\nLeaflets were handed out before the England game warning local fans against racism, that \u201cdid nothing to change behaviour and tackle the problem of racism and discrimination\u201d.\n\n(Image: VASSIL DONEV/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n(Image: Michael Zemanek/BPI/REX)\n\nFare\u2019s Pavel Klymenko said: \u201cBulgarian football has been infiltrated by far-right groups who use the stadiums to spread their message of hate. The Bulgarian FA\u2019s response has virtually been non-existent.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to work with the Bulgarian FA to do more positive things, but they are not interested. They have not even responded to our letters.\n\n\u201cWe do not even have the provision of banning orders within Bulgarian \u00adfootball. Even when the perpetrators are identified they continue to attend matches. The question is, is the will there within the Bulgarian FA to do anything about racism and \u00addiscrimination within their game?\u201d", "description": "Campaigners have accused Bulgarian football chiefs of doing nothing to halt their game\u2019s far-right infiltration by neo-Nazi thugs", "authors": ["Jeremy Armstrong", "Ben Glaze", "Image", "Vassil Donev Epa-Efe Rex", "Reuters", "Getty Images", "Michael Zemanek Bpi Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581066.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
