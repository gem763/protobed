It\u2019s just such a pivotal time right now in women\u2019s sports, and we\u2019re seeing change happen.\u201d\n\nThe six-time Olympic and 11-time world champion had a baby girl in November and will compete on the women\u2019s relay team next week at the worlds in Doha, where she will have a new apparel sponsor, Athleta, after spending years with Nike.\n\nNike responded to the outcry, as well, announcing in May that it would not apply performance-related pay reductions for pregnant athletes for a consecutive period of 12 months. Then, last month, the company expanded that to 18 months - starting eight months before the due date - and pledged to include specific language about pregnancy in its contracts to reinforce the policy.\n\n\u201cWe recognize we can do more and that there is an important opportunity for the sports industry to evolve to support female athletes,\u201d Nike said in a statement.\n\nThe fights for women\u2019s rights in soccer and track have taken different trajectories and centered on different issues, but both had been underway for several years before they came to a head this summer.\n\nThe members of the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team, with Megan Rapinoe spearheading the move, brought their longstanding struggle for equal pay to the fore during their march to the World Cup title this summer.\n\nAt issue is the difference in the collectively bargained pay structures between the U.S. men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, which for decades has left the women making less per game.\n\nThe women\u2019s team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit in March, and in the aftermath of its victory in the World Cup, momentum has been building for a revisiting of the pay gap, including a bill in Congress that would ensure equal pay for athletes who represent the United States in global competitions.\n\nTrack and field hasn\u2019t dealt with as many equal-pay issues, in part because men and women compete at the same time at the same venue, so there\u2019s never been an accurate way to measure attendance and viewership for one gender over the other.\n\nThe women\u2019s side of the sport has long produced as much talent and star power as the men: Felix, Sanya Richards-Ross, Marion Jones, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, and the list goes on. Meanwhile, USA Track and Field has established a pay system based on merit and potential that pays men and women equally.\n\n\u201cI understand the discrepancies in other sports, and exposure and differences in that sort of thing,\u201d said agent Paul Doyle, who represents a number of track athletes, including hurdler Nia Ali, a mother of two. But in track and field, \u201cthis is the same exposure. Diamond League meets have just as many female events as male events. It\u2019s as interesting a sport as the men\u2019s sport.\u201d\n\nBut, as the world found out this year, the conversation changes when it comes to endorsement contracts in a sport in which an increasing number of female athletes are putting careers on hold to have babies, then returning to compete at a high level.\n\nIn May, Montano, the six-time U.S. champion who famously raced while she was eight months pregnant, broke nondisclosure agreements with Nike to produce a video describing the reality of being a woman in track and field.\n\n\u201cThe sports industry allows for men to have a full career, and when a woman decides to have a baby, it pushes women out at their prime,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I told (Nike) I wanted to have a baby during my career, they said, \u2018Simple, we\u2019ll just pause your contract and stop paying you.\u2019\u201d\n\nMontano is five months pregnant with her third child and now has a sponsorship deal with an active wear company, Cadenshae, which has vowed to support her regardless of whether she returns to the track.\n\nHer message led Felix and Goucher to both go public with their stories, as well.\n\nIn a New York Times opinion piece, Felix recounted how Nike \u201cwanted to pay me 70% less than before.\u201d She eventually helped push the company to change the way it deals with pregnant athletes. When Nike revised its contracts, she celebrated.\n\n\u201cThis means that female athletes will no longer be financially penalized for having a child,\u201d Felix wrote on Instagram.\n\nGoucher also participated in the op-ed, describing the pressure she felt from Nike to go back to training instead of caring for her newborn son, Colt. Despite Nike\u2019s changes, Goucher now lists Altra as her shoe sponsor.\n\nWhile Goucher and Montano will not compete in Doha this week, Felix will be there, and she won\u2019t be the only mother on the track.\n\nAli, the 2016 Olympic silver medalist in the 100 hurdles, will be there . Two-time Olympic sprint champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of Jamaica is a mom. Marathoner Roberta Groner has three kids.\n\nJoanna Hayes, the 2004 Olympic gold medalist, now coaches 20-year-old hurdler Sydney McLaughlin. Nine years ago, Hayes put her career on hold to have a baby, then \u201ccame back on a whim, just to have fun, and I ran OK.\u201d But nearly a decade later, the issue is resonating much more widely, and not only on the track and the soccer pitch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a big difference,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cYou hear stories about this in corporate America - so many things that women go through just to have children, and so I think it\u2019s just great to see women standing together for a cause.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For decades, the message to women in track and field was crystal clear: get pregnant, lose sponsorship money.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eddie Pells", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/worlds_pregnancy_penalty_athletics_65574_c0-222-5292-3307_s1770x1032.jpg?dc93cd1e7671e4c6ec89e4da55702e4422405141", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
