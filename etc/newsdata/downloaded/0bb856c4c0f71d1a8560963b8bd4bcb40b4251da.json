Mr. Semprevivo has admitted that he paid $400,000 to get his son admitted to Georgetown as a tennis recruit. ev en though the son did not play tennis competitively.\n\nAnticipating that other parents scheduled for sentencing in the weeks ahead might follow Mr. Semprevivo\u2019s lead and hire similar consultants, Judge Talwani warned: \u201cI maybe should say to you, before I get nine more of these: I don\u2019t feel I need an expert report from a criminologist to tell me how to rule here, particularly where it\u2019s the same criminologist that\u2019s going to be probably presenting for everybody in L.A.\u201d\n\nHiring consultants for criminal sentencings is perfectly legal, and former prosecutors said they did not fault defendants for drawing on expert help to try to avoid going to prison. Lawyers for poor defendants also sometimes submit videos or reports from sentencing consultants or mitigation experts during sentencing. But public defenders and court-appointed attorneys have limited budgets for commissioning such materials.\n\nJudge Talwani sentenced Mr. Sloane and Mr. Semprevivo, who were among the first parents in the case to be sentenced, each to four months in prison \u2014 less than prosecutors had sought, but more than defense lawyers had argued for. Each man had pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud; the judge calculated that the four-month sentences fell within federal guidelines.\n\nThe actress Felicity Huffman \u2014 whose lawyers commissioned and submitted a statistical analysis of sentences for similar defendants \u2014 was sentenced to 14 days in prison for conspiring to cheat on her daughter\u2019s SAT exam.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Semprevivo did not respond to questions about his sentencing presentation. One of Mr. Sloane\u2019s attorneys, Nathan J. Hochman, defended Mr. Sloane\u2019s proposed community service project and said it was an effort not to avoid punishment but to give back to society in a substantive way.", "description": "Some parents who have pleaded guilty in the admissions fraud case are turning to consultants and doctors in an effort to secure lenient sentences.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/us/00richjustice-01/00richjustice-01-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
