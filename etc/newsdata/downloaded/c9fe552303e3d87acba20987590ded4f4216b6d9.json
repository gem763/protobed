It was not immediately clear what effect the ruling would have.\n\nA government official said Johnson believed parliament remained suspended pending a ruling by the Supreme Court.\n\nJohnson announced on Aug. 28 that parliament would be prorogued, saying the government wanted the suspension so it could then launch a new legislative agenda.\n\nOpponents said the real reason was to shut down debate and challenges to his Brexit plans. The court was shown documents that showed Johnson was considering prorogation weeks before he formally asked Queen Elizabeth to suspend the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe UK government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda,\u201d a government spokesman said in response to Wednesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cProroguing parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks after Britain\u2019s parliament voted on whether to hold an early general election, in Parliament in London, Britain, September 10, 2019, in this still image taken from Parliament TV footage.

In their full ruling, published on Wednesday, the judges ruled the issue was not a matter for the courts.\n\nAn appeal in that case is due to be heard on Sept. 17 at the Supreme Court.", "description": "Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was unlawful and should be annulled, Scotland's highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday in a damning verdict on the British prime minister's reasons for the shutdown.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428690736&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0O1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
