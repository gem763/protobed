The United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those plans violate China\u2019s market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology.\n\nU.S. and Chinese tariff hikes on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s imports have disrupted trade in goods from soybeans to medical equipment and battered traders on both sides.\n\nChinese exporters also face pressure from weakening global consumer demand at a time when Beijing is telling them to find other markets to replace the U.S.\n\nChina\u2019s politically sensitive trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed to $31.3 billion in August from $27 billion a year earlier.\n\nChina\u2019s global exports fell 3% to $214.8 billion, while imports were up 1.7% at $180 billion. For the first eight months of 2019, exports were off 1% from a year earlier and imports were down 5.6%.\n\nChina\u2019s global trade surplus rose 25% from a year earlier to $34.8 billion. Exports to the European Union rose 3% from a year earlier to $38.3 billion.\n\nU.S. and Chinese negotiators are preparing for talks in October, later than initially planned, but neither side has given any sign of offering concessions that might break a deadlock over how to enforce a deal.\n\nBeijing says Trump\u2019s punitive tariffs must be lifted once an agreement takes effect. Washington says some must stay to ensure Beijing carries out any promises it makes.\n\nThe decision to go ahead with talks despite the latest tit-for-tat tariff hikes on Sept. 1 encouraged global financial markets.\n\nIn their latest escalation, Washington imposed 15% tariffs on $112 billion of Chinese imports and plans to hit another $160 billion on Dec. 15. That would extend penalties to almost everything the United States buys from China.\n\nBeijing responded by imposing duties of 10% and 5% on a range of American imports. More increases are due on Dec. 15 in line with the U.S. penalties.\n\nU.S. tariffs of 25% imposed previously on $250 billion of Chinese goods are due to rise to 30% on Oct. 1.\n\nChina has imposed or announced penalties on an estimated $120 billion of U.S. imports. Some have been hit with increases more than once, while about $50 billion of U.S. goods is unaffected, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries.\n\nBeijing also has retaliated by canceling purchases of soybeans, the biggest single U.S. export to China.\n\nThe Chinese government has agreed to narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. but is reluctant to give up development strategies it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\n\nSome analysts suggest Beijing is holding out in hopes Trump will feel pressure to make a more favorable deal as his campaign for the 2020 presidential election picks up. Trump has warned that if he is re-elected, China will face a tougher U.S. negotiating stance.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "China's trade with the United States is falling sharply as the two sides prepare for more negotiations with no sign of progress toward ending a worsening tariff war that threatens global economic growth.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/China_Trade_03952.jpg-d4d02_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
