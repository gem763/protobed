But as of late, the rain has been quite torrential, meaning no parent should step out the door without a puddle suit to kit their kid out in.\n\nA puddle suit is usually a lightweight, all-in-one garment that is splash proof rather than watertight, although every brand is different.\n\nBut what to look for in a puddle suit?\n\nIdeally, you want something that is lightweight and easy to do up and take off; pay special attention to the location of zips and poppers. Pack away suits are particularly useful \u2013 as they\u2019ll be easy to stow away and are perfect for travel.\n\nWe recommend buying a size larger to enable layering up underneath when the temperature dips. However, some puddle suits are fully lined and therefore warm enough.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up the very best puddle suits out there, all of which will ensure that rain never stops play\u2026\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The middle is elasticated, the hood (complete with peaked cap) is detachable. There is every bell and whistle you can imagine \u2013 the designers clearly really know their stuff.\n\nBuy now\n\nPackaway waterproof dungarees: \u00a329, Jo Jo Maman Bebe\n\nSure, these don\u2019t have arms but we don\u2019t think this matters too much, if you are in possession of a waterproof jacket, or for summer days where it is wet underfoot but not raining.\n\nMade from recycled polyester with a PU coating, we love that these feel so sturdy \u2013 check out the durable buckles on the straps \u2013 but are also light and easy to move about in. They are also wind resistant which makes them unexpectedly warm.\n\nBuy now\n\nCharco waterproof puddle suit: \u00a315.95, Regatta\n\nMade from breathable Isolite fabric which has a durable water repellent coating, this suit is waterproof and ensures little ones are kept cosy thanks to breeze blocking at the garment\u2019s wrists and ankles.\n\nThe zip runs from the neck right down to the right ankle which makes taking it on and off is not only easy, but clean and tidy. We love the playful tiger design: bright orange with a detailed face on the hood, complete with ears. It\u2019s very light indeed.\n\nBuy now\n\nMuddy Puddles all-in-one puddlepac: \u00a323, Muddy Puddles\n\nThis completely waterproof suit is made from recycled plastic and boasts a gorgeous dandelion print which is wonderfully at odds with rainy days. As any parent or carer knows, keeping little heads warm and protected is no mean feat. We really appreciated that the elastic hood stayed nicely in place despite a particularly breezy day.\n\nUnlined, it folds right down into a diminutive pocket so it won\u2019t feel like a burden to pop it into a handbag or even coat pocket. It even features a little carabiner so you can attach it to a buggy.\n\nBuy now\n\nNext pink unicorn puddle suit: From \u00a311.50, Next\n\nThis shower resistant suit will brighten up any rainy day \u2013 let\u2019s face it who doesn\u2019t want to morph into a unicorn from time to time? We especially appreciated the little touches like the pastel coloured \"mane\" on the back of the hood.\n\nThis is lightweight and roomy, splash-proof rather than waterproof. There are no stirrups on the legs but we found the elasticated bands stayed snugly in place over wellies.\n\nBuy now\n\nMarks & Spencer duck puddle suit: \u00a320, Marks & Spencer\n\nWe\u2019ve tried to come up with a cuter image than a child in a duck suit jumping in puddles and we\u2019re stumped. This cosy fleece-lined puddle suit is simply adorable. The duck beak peak on the hood is a clever touch, although the hood is a little small to be practical.\n\nWhat we really liked was that the zip (with two poppers at the top) was extra-long, travelling all the way down the suit\u2019s right leg. This is hugely helpful when getting children (particularly much younger infants) ready for outside.There are \"hidden\" elasticated cuffs at wrists and ankles which only adds to the cosiness.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Puddle suits\n\nWet Wednesdays wins the day for its durability, the quality of the design and the chic colourways.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
