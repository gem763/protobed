She was working as a brand manager in New York, but now appears to devote her time primarily to Extinction Rebellion\n\nBrand manager Michele Radinovic, 33, was building a successful career in marketing before illness forced her to leave her job in New York and move back to Sydney in 2017.\n\nTwo years on, she is protesting full time, with her job listed as the 'media and messaging coordinator' for Extinction Rebellion.\n\nMs Radinovic was arrested during a sit in at Broadway on Monday, where she held a sign reading: 'Create the world our hearts know is possible.'\n\nShe shared a photograph of herself being walked out by police, captioning it 'for climate justice', before a photograph of herself smiling while holding her court summons.\n\n'Between extinction and rebellion, I choose rebellion,' she wrote.\n\nShe told AAP on Tuesday climate change was 'the biggest issue of our time,' and intervention by authorities did not frighten her.\n\n'I am willing to put my liberty on the line for this,' she said.\n\nMs Radinovic is heavily involved in Extinction Rebellion, and lists the organisation as her employer on her LinkedIn page\n\nSophie Thompson, 22, is another who put her life on hold to protest.\n\nThe former midwife, quit her job in Rockhampton two weeks ago to become a full time activist.\n\nOn September 30, she shut down both lanes of the Victoria Bridge by climbing up a 10 metre tripod about 7.30am - causing peak hour chaos.\n\nPictures show her holding an umbrella that read 'climate denial is child abuse'.\n\nShe also broadcast the event live on Facebook for around 40 minutes while demanding 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2025.\n\nEric Serge Herbert, 20, was studying nanoscience in Sydney before taking on a role as a leader for extinction rebellion in Brisbane.\n\nHe made headlines in June after supergluing himself to a zebra crossing in the Brisbane CBD, and has since been the face of many outlandish protest actions.\n\nMidwife Sophie Thompson, 22, perched up a 10m bamboo tripod on Monday for an hour on Brisbane's Victoria Bridge. Ms Thompson quit her job as a midwife two weeks ago to become a climate activist\n\nHerbert, an unemployed former university student who is supported by his parents, told the court he was protesting the 'genocide of life on earth' after he was arrested earlier this year\n\nHerbert has since become one of Extinction Rebellion's most recognisable faces, and often takes centre stage at protests\n\nHerbert is believed to be supported by his wealthy parents, who live in a waterfront home in Pelican Waters.\n\nHe claimed on social media he did not live there, but told a Magistrate differently during a court appearance earlier this year.\n\nHerbert, is a triplet and one of five children. He went to Unity College, a Catholic and Uniting Church school in Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast.\n\nHis triplet sisters Elisha and Renee each have 1.4 million Instagram followers and contracts with Chadwick and Elite Models in Sydney and Los Angeles.\n\n'Yeah, he lives in Sydney and studies science \u2013 he's super smart,' they told Husskie magazine in 2017 before their brother dropped out.\n\n'He's not into [us being models and influencers] at all, he's so not about it. He doesn't let us take photos. We have like one photo of him.'\n\nTodd Dent, 40, was arrested in Brisbane on Tuesday for concreting his hand inside a barrel.\n\nHe was pictured wearing a rainbow sombrero and smiling as he sat in the back of a ute with his hand inside the green cylinder.\n\nMr Dent is a carpenter by trade, but also considers himself an artist.\n\nFour years ago he founded Primal School, which turns discarded timber and other building materials into artworks or furniture.\n\nTodd Dent (pictured) was seen with a colourful sombrero on his head and his arm in a concrete-filled barrel during a protest in Brisbane on Tuesday\n\nDr Martin Wolterding, who teaches biology at the University of Western Sydney, was arrested in Sydney on Monday after refusing to get up during the sit in on Broadway.\n\nDr Wolterding, a father of two, was born in the US but lives in Springwood, NSW.\n\nAs police took him away from the crowd, he told officers: 'Leave me alone, you're hurting me.'\n\n'I'm 75 years old for God's sake,' he said.\n\nDr Martin Wolterding, a biology lecturer at the University of Western Sydney, was also arrested on Monday\n\nFormer Greens candidate Jonathan Doig was also arrested during Monday's sit-in.\n\nHe told friends on Facebook he was charged with failing to comply with a police direction regarding the road, and was one of 29 people arrested.\n\n'We were held in Goulburn St police station for six hours before release,' he said,\n\n'Three to a small cell, with a glass front wall, like puppies in a pet shop. The mood was buoyant as we sang protest songs and cheered each new arrival.\n\n'Police made regular checks on our well-being, gave us chilled water and allowed us toilet breaks and phone calls.\n\n'They also switched the TVs to ABC News so we could watch the coverage.'\n\nFormer Greens candidate Jonathan Doig (pictured) said he was pleased with the treatment protesters received from police on Monday. Protesters were reportedly given cups of chilled water and allowed to watch ABC news from their holding cells", "description": "Many of the Australians protesting across the country this week have not protested before, but are leaving behind jobs and study to take up the cause of climate change.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/04/19424946-0-image-a-58_1570503929825.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
