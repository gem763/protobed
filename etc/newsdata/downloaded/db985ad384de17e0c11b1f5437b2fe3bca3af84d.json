(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring a 91-minute campaign rally, a mere 14 seconds left an indelible imprint on President Trump.\n\nRousing supporters in Manchester, N.H., in the aftermath of two gun massacres last month, Trump proclaimed that he would \u201calways uphold the Second Amendment.\u201d The arena crowd burst into applause so rapturous that the president paused for those 14 seconds to absorb it.\n\nThe cheers were the most electric of the night and, in Trump\u2019s view, a searing reminder of the perils of crossing his base \u2014 especially on the issue of guns. The president was taken by the crowd\u2019s overwhelming response and has been recounting it to advisers as they weigh possible policy prescriptions to address the epidemic of mass shootings, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal private deliberations.\n\nWith the gun debate taking center stage in Washington as Congress reconvenes this week, lawmakers in both parties are looking to the president for signals on what legislation \u2014 if any \u2014 might be possible. Yet many hoping for stricter gun laws fret that Trump, despite at times advocating tougher restrictions, will ultimately be reluctant to break with gun rights supporters, especially as he heads into his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nTrump campaigned for president as a dealmaker with few ideological convictions and a promise to reach across the aisle and summon bold results. Instead, on a host of issues including guns, immigration and the trade war with China, Trump has hewed closely to the expectations of MAGA nation \u2014 the millions of high-intensity, hard-right supporters who helped lift him to victory.\n\n\u201cThe base is in the calculus, but it\u2019s not calculus in the traditional sense that you\u2019d think,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman. \u201cHis base likes what he\u2019s doing, and they trust him to advocate on their behalf, and that includes working to ensure mentally ill people don\u2019t get guns and at the same time protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms.\u201d\n\n\n\nSupporters cheer before President Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally in Manchester, N.H., on Aug. 15. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to the president and Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager, argued that Trump has both advanced conventional conservatism, such as by cutting taxes and opposing abortion, and bucked it, such as by supporting same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to define the so-called \u2018Trump base\u2019 in conventional political terms,\u201d Conway said. \u201cHe won millions of Obama voters and other disaffected Democrats. He appealed to Americans as the \u2018forgotten man\u2019 and the \u2018forgotten woman,\u2019 not as the red team and the blue team. He tackled concerns others had ignored, like China, the drug crisis and imbalanced trade deals. This will help to secure and expand his base of support.\u201d\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents the El Paso district where one of the recent mass shootings occurred, said she was disappointed that, in her view, Trump seems poised to make little meaningful progress on gun control measures.\n\n\u201cMy only theory is that he knows that if some of the core issues that are important to his base get eroded, that that could cost him those key votes that helped him win the electoral college, because he lost the popular vote,\u201d she said.\n\nEscobar added that while Trump\u2019s base is \u201cpretty solid,\u201d there are nonetheless \u201csome things for his base that would be unforgivable\u201d \u2014 including serious restrictions on guns and \u201cif he doesn\u2019t stop brown people from Central America from coming into the country.\u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s political advisers believe that if the president pursues gun control, it would represent a serious breach with his base of gun rights supporters.\n\n\u201cHis base is loyal to him and won\u2019t vote against him, but there could be some dealbreakers that cause them to stay home altogether,\u201d said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid political assessment.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump walks out to greet Romanian President Klaus Iohannis at the South Portico of the White House on Aug. 20. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nA Queens-born Manhattan real estate developer, Trump has not always approached the issue of guns as he does now. In his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d Trump staked out his own middle ground. \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support a ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSince running for president in 2015, however, Trump has adopted the current Republican hard-line position on guns. Some current and former White House aides said that while Trump may not approach the topic with deeply held convictions, he has come to appreciate the cultural significance of protecting gun rights to his supporters and therefore is reluctant to take any action that might alienate them.\n\n\u201cHe feels a little insecure about them, because he\u2019s not one of them,\u201d said a conservative operative in frequent touch with the White House.\n\nRecent polling data provided to the White House also found that gun control measures could be problematic for Trump with the core supporters he needs to activate to secure a second term, according to someone familiar with the data. The New York Times first reported the existence of the polling data.\n\nOther polling paints a more complicated picture. Americans across party and demographic lines overwhelmingly support expanded background checks for gun buyers and allowing law enforcement to temporarily seize weapons from troubled individuals, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week. More Americans also say they trust congressional Democrats over Trump to handle the nation\u2019s gun laws, 51 percent to 36 percent, with independents siding with Democrats by a 17-point margin, the poll showed.\n\nTrump may yet help push through gun legislation when Congress returns from its summer recess this week. The White House and Congress are still discussing a range of options, and aides on both sides privately express cautious optimism for some sort of deal.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) \u2014 whose previous failed bipartisan background checks legislation with Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) serves as one template for potential compromise \u2014 has counseled Trump that he has the clout as president to take action without paying a political price with his supporters, a Manchin aide said.\n\nManchin pointed out to Trump that his base did not desert him after his administration late last year imposed a ban on bump stocks, a device that allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster, the aide said. Manchin also told the president how he has been able to defend his support for background checks to his constituents in West Virginia, where Trump won nearly 68 percent of the vote in 2016.\n\n\n\nJoe Grogan, domestic policy director, and Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, wait for President Trump to make remarks on opioids at the White House on Sept. 4. (Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) also has been talking to Trump about a policy response to this summer\u2019s mass shootings, detailing for the president how he navigated the political terrain as Florida governor after the 2018 Parkland school shooting, a spokesman said. Scott convened discussions among educators, law enforcement and mental health professionals, and signed new state legislation, including a \u201cred flag\u201d law.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s told the president and Senate leadership is to look at Florida as an example,\u201d Scott spokesman Chris Hartline said.\n\nWhite House officials rejected the notion that Trump is making decisions because he\u2019s worried about his base.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a political calculus that exists, but as the president has said, it\u2019s not about what helps him politically,\u201d Gidley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political calculus in the sense of what actually can pass getting bipartisan support and what actually works to prevent these shootings.\u201d\n\nOutsiders, however, are deeply skeptical that electoral calculations are not at play. Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat whose Ohio city suffered a mass shooting in August, said she thinks it\u2019s \u201call a political maneuver\u201d for Trump.\n\n\u201cHe is in a pickle come 2020 around his base,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cHe has to keep them engaged and the intensity hot, and if he walks from them on an issue, he\u2019s worried they\u2019ll walk from him and intensity will leave him.\u201d\n\nOne Republican Senate aide, who requested anonymity to candidly assess the president, said that on an issue like guns, the president simply \u201cdoesn\u2019t care enough\u201d to engage in the legislative arm-twisting required to broker a deal.\n\nTrump has long had difficulty navigating the racial and cultural dynamics within his overwhelmingly white base, including drawing criticism for declining to forcefully condemn white supremacy and other forms of bigotry.\n\nIn July, when the crowd at a North Carolina campaign rally began chanting, \u201cSend her back,\u201d echoing Trump\u2019s racist tweets about Somali-born Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), the president stood silently at center stage to take it in. He did not condemn his supporters.\n\nThe next day, at the White House, Trump sought to distance himself from the chanters. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with that message that they gave,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt was quite a chant, and I felt a little bit badly about it.\u201d\n\nThen Trump seemed to change course again by commending his chanting rallygoers as \u201cincredible patriots.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Trump stops to talk to reporters as he walks to Marine One to depart from the South Lawn of the White House on Aug. 9. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOn some issues, such as immigration and his trade war with China, Trump has long-held personal beliefs that predate his presidential candidacy. But even in those areas, Trump occasionally vacillates and shuffles toward the center before returning to the siren calls of his hard-right base.\n\nDuring his first year in office, Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress seemed to have reached a broad deal on immigration, which would have included protections for young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. But amid outcry from conservatives and conservative pundits, Trump scrapped any prospects of major immigration compromise and retreated behind his \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d campaign mantra.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s base, the trade war with China, meanwhile, is less about his policies and more about the president\u2019s combative posture and implicit promise to stand up to those he has accused of taking advantage of Americans for decades, according to the president\u2019s advisers.\n\nAt moments when Trump has wavered on China, Vice President Pence and national security adviser John Bolton have both prodded the president back to a more forceful position by reminding him, in part, that this is what his base wants, someone familiar with the discussions said.\n\nCurrent and former aides have described Trump\u2019s approach to an array of issues as a form of stress-testing \u2014 throwing out ideas to gauge reaction, not only from his base but also in the media and from his kitchen cabinet of advisers.\n\nCliff Sims, a former White House official, has a phrase for it: \u201cStrong opinions, weakly held.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has strong opinions on almost anything under the sun and he\u2019s not afraid to share them with anybody, but the only two issues he has deeply held beliefs are immigration and trade,\u201d Sims said. \u201cEverything else he\u2019s willing to be convinced that he should change his position if shown compelling evidence. And isn\u2019t that what we should want from our leaders?\u201d", "description": "\u2018His base is loyal to him and won\u2019t vote against him, but there could be some dealbreakers that cause them to stay home altogether,\u2019 one senior administration official said.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter", "Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tGRMZg7ooC37frYCxICUVYmRr18=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7ZPHVNF7XYI6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
