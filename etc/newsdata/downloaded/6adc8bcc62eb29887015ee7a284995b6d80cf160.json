For others, it means fall allergies: itchy and watery eyes, coughing, sneezing, congestion, and runny nose. Such is the life of a seasonal allergy sufferer. If you don\u2019t have to put up with allergies every spring or autumn, consider yourself lucky. But an estimated 50 million Americans fall into the \u201cunlucky\u201d category. Allergies are the result of your body\u2019s overreaction to a normally innocuous substance. In the case of seasonal allergies, symptoms develop when a susceptible person comes in contact with an allergen (which in the fall is usually ragweed)\u2014through the mucous membranes in your eyes, nose, or mouth and throat. The allergen gets absorbed into your blood, causing white blood cells to produce billions of antibodies (IgE). The IgE antibodies travel through the bloodstream and combine with mast cells\u2014the storage sites for histamine and other chemicals involved in the inflammatory process. The antibodies cause mast cells to release their stores of histamine into the blood\u2026and thus, allergy symptoms begin. Most Americans rely on over-the-counter corticosteroids,\n\nStep 1: Minimize Exposure to Allergens\n\nConsider removing rugs and carpets, which trap debris and allergens.\n\nUse a HEPA air purifier on every floor of your home.\n\nWash your clothes, including outerwear, every day (or at least as often as possible). They can carry microscopic allergens into your home.\n\nGet a few houseplants. They\u2019re Mother Nature\u2019s air filters, absorbing impurities in the air and breaking them down in the soil.\n\nStep 2: Nasal Irrigation\n\nantihistamines , and decongestants to find relief. While many of these drugs work, a fair share of people experience side effects like dizziness, a dry nose or mouth, and extreme drowsiness. The good news is that there are plenty of effective alternatives to traditional allergy medications. These natural options not only ease symptoms, they\u2019re safe and free of side effects. Here\u2019s my four-step approach for relieving allergies:The first step is to avoid exposure as much as possible . I know this can be difficult. You can\u2019t lock yourself in your house until the wintertime. But there are a few steps you can take to make sure you don\u2019t track pollens and other irritants into your home.You\u2019ve probably heard of neti pots , but if you haven\u2019t tried using one, you\u2019re missing out on one of the best sinus-clearing techniques around. To use a neti pot, fill it with 1 cup of warm (not hot) distilled water (do NOT use tap water!) mixed with \u00bc teaspoon of table salt. Stand over a sink, tilt your head to one side, and insert the spout into your upper nostril. Pour the solution into your nostril and allow it to drain out of your lower nostril. Repeat on the other side, then blow your nose to fully clear your nostrils. Understandably, many people cringe at the idea of pouring salt water into their nose, but studies show using a neti pot can effectively manage the symptoms of sinus infections, mild to moderate allergic rhinitis, and acute upper respiratory infections.\n\nStep 3: Supplements\n\nQuail Egg Powder has also been shown to reduce allergy symptoms. It was first discovered in the 1970s, when a French doctor noticed that farmers who raised quails had fewer allergy symptoms than others in the area. Later research revealed that a concentrated, standardized quail egg powder alleviated symptoms in as fast as 15 minutes. Even better, after 90 days of use, 70-80 percent of patients no longer experienced any unpleasant symptoms. I recommend 80 mg once a day.\n\nhas also been shown to reduce allergy symptoms.

Quercetin is a bioflavonoid naturally found in the skins of grapes, apples, and onions. It is known as a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, but it also has the ability to prevent mast cells from releasing histamine. Even though quercetin is in these foods, if you really want to fight your allergies you\u2019ll need to take a supplement. To improve quercetin\u2019s absorption, take it with a digestive enzyme like bromelain. I recommend 400 mg twice daily on an empty stomache.\n\nis a bioflavonoid naturally found in the skins of grapes, apples, and onions.

Stinging Nettles is a medicinal herb that works by putting a stop to several inflammatory events that contribute to the start of allergy symptoms. One study showed that 57 percent of allergy sufferers rated stinging nettles as an effective allergy remedy, and 48% stated the supplement was more effective than medications they had used in the past. There are many different preparations of different parts of the plant. I recommend following the directions for capsules of freeze dried leaf.\n\nis a medicinal herb that works by putting a stop to several inflammatory events that contribute to the start of allergy symptoms.

There are many essential oils that help lessen allergy symptoms, but eucalyptus is one of the best. Breathing it in helps to open up the sinuses and lungs. Plus, it has anti-inflammatory properties and works as an expectorant, clearing irritants and other \u201cgunk\u201d out of the lungs.\n\nA few supplements have a great track record for alleviating allergy symptoms. It\u2019s important to note that for maximum effect, you should start taking them at least two weeks or more before the start of allergy season, straight through until the end of it.\n\nStep 4: Adrenal Support\n\nAn often overlooked cause of allergies is adrenal fatigue. The adrenals sit just above the kidneys, and their job is to produce hormones\u2014one of which is cortisol, the \u201cstress hormone.\u201d So what does this have to do with allergies? Well, during periods of prolonged stress, the adrenals become overtaxed and fatigued, eventually unable to function effectively. This ultimately disrupts the proper production of hormones, which leads to a multitude of symptoms such as insomnia, lack of energy, depression, blood sugar swings, and\u2026increased risk of allergies. Furthermore, inadequate amounts of cortisol can result in a hyperactive immune response. This happens a lot when the body doesn\u2019t get what it needs\u2014it reacts the opposite of how you would expect it to. As such, without proper hormone release, the body produces inflammatory reactions even if there\u2019s no immediate threat or infection. In this state, you are much more prone to become allergic to pollen, grasses, ragweed, dust, dander, or any number of other irritants. There\u2019s no real test to check for adrenal fatigue per se, but a knowledgeable holistic doctor should be able to determine if you have this based on symptoms and other indicators. There are many adrenal support supplements available, containing ingredients such as licorice root, rhodiola, ashwaghanda, magnesium, and B vitamins. Improving your diet, exercising regularly, and reducing your stress load are also extremely helpful. I encourage you to try these natural remedies as we approach allergy season. Start now, before the peak!\n\nReferences", "description": "For some people, the fall season means football, cooler weather, .09/02/2019 3:13:26AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
