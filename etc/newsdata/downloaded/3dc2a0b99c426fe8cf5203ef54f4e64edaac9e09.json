The aircraft was filled with passengers and set to take-off.\n\nAt 10:30 a.m. on July 17th, American Airlines flight 2834 pulled out of gate 49 at Miami International Airport headed for the Bahamas. But pilots noticed a problem and as the plane, with 150 people aboard, moved into position on the runway, they were forced to turn around.\n\nAccording to investigators, American Airlines mechanic Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani, who appeared in a Florida court Friday, was seen on surveillance video tampering with the plane's navigation systems just an hour before it was scheduled to depart. Alani, who's worked for American since 1988, said he tried to sabotage the plane because he was upset about a stalled contract dispute between his union and American Airlines and that it had affected him financially.\n\nCaptain Laura Einsetler said had the plane taken off, it could have been catastrophic.\n\n\"It is significant. Any time we reject a takeoff, that's a big deal,\" she said.\n\nAlani said he hoped sabotaging the plane would allow him to get overtime pay to fix it. American Airlines called it a disturbing event and said that it has been cooperating with the investigation.", "description": "According to investigators, he was seen on surveillance video tampering with the plane's navigation systems just an hour before it was set to depart", "authors": ["Jeff Pegues"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/07/466e8ded-2f91-4dd5-82e5-6c459fed0be0/thumbnail/1200x630g9/8a0834ec3dffd70c0de011cabe237d72/americanplane.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
