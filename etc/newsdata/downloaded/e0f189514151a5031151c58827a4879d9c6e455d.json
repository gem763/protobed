The 53-storey building at Circular Quay, which will be called Salesforce Tower to reflect its largest tenant, is part of a new precinct which will include a public plaza, retail laneways and wellness facilities.\n\n\"The deal we did for Salesforce reflects a couple of things \u2013 it reflects a company that's growing globally, but also wants a much different presence in the Sydney market,\" says John Burton, managing director of urban regeneration at Lendlease.\n\n\"Most of those people want well-curated, well-managed, mixed-use precincts. For their employees, the ability to connect to not just shopping but facilities and services and wellness and activation is critical.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen major consultants taking additional space for IT projects associated with the increase in risk mitigation and control.\" \u2014 Darren Steinberg, Dexus\n\nAs well-located sites become harder to find, developers are developing unconventional sites and capitalising on their quirks. Builder and developer Built is constructing a new office tower at 183-185 Clarence Street \u2013 which TH Real Estate purchased last year for $180 million \u2013 on the site of an old power substation. Built will retain the cavernous ground-level hall for cultural and other activities.\n\nSome drivers of demand are unusual. Following last year's banking royal commission Australia's four largest banks are splitting from their troubled wealth-management divisions. Westpac is transferring its BT arm to Viridian, NAB will sell MLC, Commonwealth Bank is selling various assets as it exits from wealth management and ANZ is selling its pensions and investments arm to IOOF.\n\nThese various transactions are also spurring demand for office space, Rawnsley says.\n\n\"These entities will be spun out and they definitely won\u2019t be in the same buildings any more,\" he says. \"They\u2019ll be looking for 30,000-40,000sq m of prime space.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDarren Steinberg, head of Dexus, the country's largest office landlord, says a further driver for demand is coming from the post-royal commission environment that is demanding a greater investment in compliance within financial services.\n\n\"Additional office space is being absorbed as groups spin off divisions, expanding to meet increasing compliance requirements and upgrading the technology needed to meet them,\" he says.\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen major consultants taking additional space for IT projects associated with the increase in risk mitigation and control; a strong driver of take up in Sydney and Melbourne.\"\n\nOther sources of cranes are Brookfield's $1.8 billion Wynyard Place, a precinct at 10 Carrington Street that will feature a 59,000sq m office tower across 27 levels, two restored heritage buildings \u2013 Shell House and 285 George Street \u2013 and an upgrade of Wynyard train station's George Street entrance. Insurer Allianz and NAB are anchor tenants.\n\nGlobal phenomenon\n\nThe strength of demand that has pushed vacancy rates as low as 3.7 per cent in Sydney \u2013 an 11-year-low \u2013 and a near-record 3.3 per cent in Melbourne is not just a local thing. Steinberg says buoyant city economies are a global phenomenon.\n\n\"London\u2019s office market should be faltering as the Brexit chaos rolls on. Instead its vacancy rate is only 5.5 per cent on the back of resilient demand,\" he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how long will that demand last? Steinberg agrees it will ease, given that the current cycle of strong demand has been under way for four years already, but says the sustained strength of leasing markets is surprising.\n\nHis investors certainly see the cycle continuing for a while. Dexus shares rose more than 3 per cent on Wednesday after the developer and landlord said it expected to be able to raise rents further when leases due to expire in the next couple of years come up for renewal.\n\nIndustry estimates indicate net take-up of office space in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane CBD will remain strong for some years. They show nearly 183,000sq m will be absorbed in the current year \u2013 with 70,000sq m of that in Sydney and 100,000sq m in Melbourne \u2013 followed by 116,500sq m next year (as Sydney drops to just 10,000sq m) and then pick up again to 192,000sq m in 2022 and 199,000sq m in 2023.\n\nLendlease's Burton says the \"pretty benign\" office supply pipeline means Sydney's vacancy rate will only pick up to about 5 per cent by next year.\n\n\"What we are going through at the moment is what is nearly historically low levels of vacancy and that looks as though that will probably run for the next 18 months to two years before there is the likelihood of supply coming forward,\" he says.\n\nNext cycle\n\nThe wave of office projects \u2013 at a time when residential projects are waning \u2013 represents a rebalancing of the development cycle. It's a far cry from the heady days of 2016 when the City of Sydney, concerned about the rapacious appetite for residential development, brought planning changes to limit the spread of new apartments in the CBD.\n\n\"Three or four years ago we were worried that residential development was crowding out commercial development in the most productive parts of our cities,\" Rawnsley says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Commercial\u2019s been able to reassert itself in its traditional locations.\"\n\nThe challenge, he says, is to consider where will the prime locations for office space will be in the next cycle.\n\nBurton expects to see a lot more construction in the Sydney CBD over the next few years.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of stock in the overall Sydney CBD that is ripe for either serious replacement or refurbishment,\" he says. \"Companies like ours never stop looking for those opportunities.\"\n\nBut Sydney's ongoing growth \u2013 particularly along new transport corridors \u2013 will extend a process of expansion out from the CBD, Rawnsley says.\n\n\"The Sydney metro crane map shows there\u2018s more expansion away from the traditional expensive CBD locations, providing for more high-quality office space across the city.\"", "description": "The wave of commercial property developments is a consequence of strong CBD economies \u2013 and marks a rebalancing after the residential boom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2129%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1600428ce8b32982a5d651cc37ae27462987e12f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
