One industry source said, \"Just 10 years ago, there were many young foreign laborers, but there are so many old ones now. There are rumors that the main clients of herb medicine clinics in small towns these days are not Koreans but foreign laborers.\"\n\nAnd a staffer at an employment agency in Daelim-dong in southern Seoul said, \"Construction site foremen shun ethnic Koreans from China who are 65 or older, so they have to find cleaning jobs instead.\"\n\nThe main reason behind the aging trend is that more ethnic Koreans from China are coming here in search of work, according to a staffer at the Labor Ministry. \"They settle down here, because it is easier for them to get visas than for other foreigners.\"\n\nEthnic Koreans from overseas with F4 visas are not allowed to take menial jobs, but most ethnic Koreans from China are doing that kind of work at construction sites and small factories.\n\n", "description": "Foreign Migrant Workers Growing Older", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/21/2019102100421_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
