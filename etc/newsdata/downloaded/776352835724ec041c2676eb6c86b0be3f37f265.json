The Sarov nuclear center is also where the old Soviet Union created its first atomic weapon back in 1949 and houses powerful supercomputers.\n\nBaykov is the latest scientist at the center docked for diverting computing resources to mine bitcoin.\n\nTwo other scientists at the base \u2014 Andrei Shatokin and Andrei Rybkin are also facing charges relating to illegal bitcoin mining. Both men are still awaiting a decision from the court.\n\nAccording to Alexei Kovalyov, defense counsel for one of the accused scientists said his client employed means to avoid detection and had successfully mined some bitcoin before being caught.\n\nKovalyov\u2019s conjecture points to the fact that perhaps someone inside the base ratted out the bitcoin miners, adding:\n\nI can say one thing for sure: they were not detained on the first day they began to mine.\n\nMining Anywhere and Everywhere\n\nA top-secret Russian nuclear weapons facility is one of a growing list of bizarre locations for bitcoin mining around the world. The activity seems to no longer be restricted to vast mining farms in places like China and North America.\n\n\u2018instead, there are reports of crypto mining activities in college dorms, workplaces, and anywhere else with electricity and internet connection. Earlier in the year, bitcoin miners in Iran reportedly flocked to mosques to enjoy free electricity.\n\nThis trend led to authorities in Tehran enacting a special electricity tariff for crypto miners. This act also legalized the industry in the country, with the government offering a substantial tax holiday to miners to repatriate their foreign earnings.\n\nSince the hash rate fell by 45% in December 2018, the computing power expended on the Bitcoin network has risen dramatically. Fears of a mining capitulation have given way in 2019 to increased bitcoin mining activity.\n\nWhat do you think about people using work computers to mine for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?
