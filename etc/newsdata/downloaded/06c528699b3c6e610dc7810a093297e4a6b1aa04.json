And they\u2019re going to say to the UK side \u2013 this is why this negotiation is going to be very ugly and very difficult \u2013 they\u2019re going to say, \u2018No we\u2019re not giving you tariff-free access to our markets if you\u2019re going to start using a whole lot of competitive tax and regulatory measures in order to undercut us\u2019.\"\n\nThe UK could still crash out at the end of the transition period if there is no agreement on the future relationship by then.", "description": "A leaked government memo appears to show how protections will be watered down", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Bbc Afp Via Getty Images", "Bpm", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735575.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
