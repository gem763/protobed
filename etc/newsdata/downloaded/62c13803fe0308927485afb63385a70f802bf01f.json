County Official Uses Anti-Gay Slur For Buttigieg", "language": "en", "text": "During a Monday night meeting in Sevier County, Tenn., county commissioner Warren Hurst directed homophobic language at a 2020 Democratic candidate, referring to the politician as \u201cqueer,\u201d and that their sexuality is \u201cabout as ugly as you can get.\u201d\n\nThe term queer \u201chas been reclaimed by some LGBTQ people to describe themselves,\u201d according to GLAAD, but \u201cit is not a universally accepted term even within the LGBTQ community.\u201d It is otherwise still widely viewed as a slur.\n\nWhile \u201cMayor Pete\u201d Buttigieg, was not mentioned by name, he is the only openly gay person currently running for President.\n\nRead more: Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s Unlikely, Untested, Unprecedented Presidential Campaign\n\nCommissioner Hurst was, at first, discussing an upcoming vote on gun sanctuary laws, according to CBS affiliate WVLT. A gun sanctuary is a place where the local jurisdiction does not enforce certain gun control laws that can be viewed as violations of the Second Amendment.\n\nBut he segued to tell local residents in attendance at the meeting that, \u201cit\u2019s time we wake up people, it\u2019s time, it\u2019s past time.\u201d He added his concerns about a \u201cliberal agenda\u201d and its impact on the United States.\n\n\u201cWe got a queer running for president, if that ain\u2019t about as ugly as you can get,\u201d Hurst continued. \u201cLook what we got running for President in the Democratic party. We can go over here to [the Sevier County Sheriff\u2019s] jail and get better people out of there than those [Democrats] running to be President of the United States.\u201d\n\nVideo from the meeting shows another man believed to be on the commission putting his hand over his face as Hurst uses the word queer. There is consternation in the audience and some audible complaints, WVLT footage shows. One woman in attendance gets up to leave. \u201cThis is not professional,\u201d she said before exiting, adding an expletive.\n\nHurst went on to claim that he is not prejudiced, adding \u201cbut by golly, a white man in this country has very few rights and they\u2019re getting took more every day.\u201d\n\nThe county that Hurst serves is 95% white, 6.3% Hispanic or Latino and 1.3% black, according to 2018 U.S. census data.\n\nAt the conclusion of Hurst\u2019s speech, some people in the audience are heard clapping. Others are seen waving American flags.\n\nNeither Hurst nor other Sevier County officials responded to TIME\u2019s request for comment prior to publication, but Hurst did speak with WVLT. He told the station that he stood by his comments because he is entitled to his opinion.\n\nA statement was posted Tuesday afternoon on the Sevier County\u2019s Twitter page, stating that the comments made by Commissioner Hurst do not represent the county\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThe statements made by Commissioner Hurst at the Sevier County Commission meeting of October 21, 2019, do not reflect the opinion or position of Sevier County administration,\u201d the tweets read. \u201cSevier County is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or status in any other group protected by law.\u201d\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.", "description": "During a commission meeting in Sevier County, the commissioner criticized 2020 Democratic candidates, referring to one of them as \"queer\".", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/time-logo-social-1.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
