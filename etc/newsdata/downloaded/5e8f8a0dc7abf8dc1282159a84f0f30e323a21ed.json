Mike Quigley Michael (Mike) Bruce QuigleyDemocrats warn GOP, Trump putting whistleblower safety at risk Democratic lawmaker: Trump responsible for 'greatest crime a president has committed in my lifetime' House Intel Dem: Giuliani could be held in inherent contempt if he ignores subpoena MORE (D-Ill.) asked if TIGTA is investigating any allegations of possible misconduct in the IRS mandatory audit program. The tax administration inspector general, J. Russell George, said TIGTA isn\u2019t conducting any investigation. But deputy inspector general James Jackson acknowledged media reports of a whistleblower, adding \u201cwe can\u2019t confirm or deny that we may or may not be doing anything.\u201d\n\nA different Treasury inspector general announced Friday that it is investigating Treasury's handling of Neal's request for Trump's tax returns, in response to a request from the chairman.\n\nThe growing interest in the IRS-audit complaint has led to new pressure on Neal. The committee chairman has acted cautiously when it comes to efforts to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns, at times frustrating progressives.\n\nRyan Thomas, spokesman for the progressive group Stand Up America, said that \u201cif this whistleblower complaint shows that Donald Trump has unduly influenced the IRS, then Chairman Neal has a duty to expose this blatant act of corruption.\u201d\n\nThe campaign for Neal\u2019s Democratic primary challenger, Holyoke, Mass., Mayor Alex Morse, criticized Neal\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cThe bungled handling of the tax whistleblower is yet another example of Congressman Neal failing to lead on critical opportunities to hold the president accountable,\u201d Morse campaign spokeswoman Gina Christo said in a statement.\n\nNeal\u2019s campaign responded by arguing that Morse wants to distract voters from his mayoral record.\n\nNeal told reporters in late September that whether he releases the whistleblower complaint is \u201csubject to what counsel advises.\u201d He told reporters in Massachusetts last week that his lawyers are trying to interview the whistleblower.\n\nThe chairman has also faced criticism from Republicans. Grassley criticized Neal for revealing that the complaint exists before lawyers followed up with whistleblower.\n\n\u201cWhistleblowers face tremendous risk in making their complaints and they need to be reassured that their complaints will be handled seriously and with care,\u201d Grassley said in a statement. \u201cAnyone who receives a whistleblower complaint should also make some effort to evaluate the facts as alleged before going public with such a complaint.\u201d\n\nAfter the Post reported that Grassley received the complaint in addition to Neal, Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenIran-linked group targeted email accounts for US presidential campaign, government officials FBI chief calls Facebook's encryption plans a 'dream come true' for child predators Voting machines pose a greater threat to our elections than foreign agents MORE (D-Ore.) called for Grassley to launch a bipartisan effort to investigate the whistleblower\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cIt would be negligent for the Finance Committee to fail to investigate a whistleblower\u2019s allegations of political interference in the presidential and vice-presidential audit process,\u201d Wyden said on Twitter. \u201cA bipartisan committee effort to get to the bottom of this should have been started months ago.\u201d\n\nHow to handle the complaint poses a challenge for Neal.\n\nLegal experts said that one way Neal could release the whistleblower complaint if he wanted would be by reading the complaint\u2019s contents aloud during a committee hearing or on the House floor. That would allow Neal to have protection from liability under the Constitution\u2019s speech or debate clause, the experts said.\n\nBut some who support Democrats\u2019 efforts to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns say there may be good reasons why Neal shouldn't make the complaint public.\n\nSeth Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said that the public doesn\u2019t know enough about the complaint to know whether the complaint's contents would identify the whistleblower \"and therefore whether it would be prudent to release more information.\u201d\n\nSteve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said whether Neal \u201caccomplishes anything from releasing more information is unclear.\u201d\n\nRosenthal said the complaint may not have provided much detail, so Ways and Means Committee staff should talk to the whistleblower before sharing more information. He said it\u2019s unclear why committee staff are moving slowly in conducting the interview.\n\nHanging over the complaint and its allegations is Neal's court fight to obtain Trump's tax returns. Rosenthal added that releasing the complaint might undercut Neal in court.\n\n\u201cI think if Neal simply releases the letter publicly, Neal might look like he\u2019s more interested in publicizing the information than pursuing the information,\u201d Rosenthal said.\n\n\"At least that\u2019s what Trump\u2019s lawyers would allege.\"", "description": "A whistleblower allegation about possible misconduct in the IRS presidential tax-return audit program is receiving new attention amid House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_taxreturns_100219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
