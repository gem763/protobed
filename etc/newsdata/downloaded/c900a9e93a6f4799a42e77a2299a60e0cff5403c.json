The proper category would be \u201cdestructive dictator,\u201d because Mr. Trump, like Hitler and Stalin, has the personality of a grandiose-paranoid dictator who would destroy all he saw as his enemies while endangering the nation that he supposedly was advancing through his leadership.\n\nThat puts him far beyond the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder into a much more dangerous zone for our nation.\n\nHenry J. Friedman\n\nCambridge, Mass.\n\nThe writer is an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.", "description": "Readers offer their answers.
