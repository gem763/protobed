Please help us by supporting our independent journalism\n\nThe All Blacks head coach, Steve Hansen, has revealed his deep respect for England\u2019s Eddie Jones after the duo swapped messages as their tactical dual approaches.\n\nAlmighty All Blacks lay waste to the side that inspired their rebuild | Liam Napier Read more\n\nOn Saturday night in Yokohama, when England and New Zealand collide in their first World Cup meeting since 1999, respect will be quickly set aside as a place in the final is furiously contested. But whatever transpires, the content of Hansen\u2019s text exchange with Jones suggests tensions will be left there.\n\n\u201cI said: \u2018Looking forward to seeing you and win, lose or draw we\u2019ll have a beer afterwards,\u2019\u201d Hansen said as he parked New Zealand\u2019s crushing 46-14 quarter-final victory over Ireland to focus on preparing for England.\n\nAt the start of this highly anticipated test week, Hansen was happy to detail why he held England\u2019s head coach in such high regard.\n\n\u201cHis passion, he loves the game. He\u2019s got a work ethic second to none \u2013 he put himself in hospital when he was here, he worked that hard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who loves the game will get my support. He\u2019s done a fantastic job with England. They\u2019ve got a world record for most wins in Test rugby along with ourselves. They\u2019ve got a harder edge about them.\n\n\u201cEddie has been part of a winning World Cup team with South Africa, he\u2019s had the disappointment of losing to England when he was coaching Australia but to get to the final is being successful anyway, even if you don\u2019t win it. He\u2019s got to the ability to understand what\u2019s coming and he\u2019ll share those with his coaching and playing group.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aaron Smith scored an early try in a dominant New Zealand win over Ireland in Saturday\u2019s quarter-final.

Hansen previously enjoyed similar close ties with the former Springboks coach Heyneke Meyer, the pair often hosting midweek dinners when touring their respective nations.\n\nWales come from behind to beat 14-man France in World Cup quarter-final Read more\n\nAs the teams warmed up before Saturday\u2019s quarter-final Hansen and the Ireland coach Joe Schmidt chatted animatedly in the middle of Tokyo Stadium for 10 minutes.\n\nHansen has, however, also fired plenty of verbal barbs in his time. The departing Australia coach Michael Cheika has been on the receiving end on several occasions. So, too, the Wales and British & Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland. Hansen claims these jibes are fun and games, part of the preliminary to the main theatre.\n\n\u201cYou see some of the banter which is really only to help promote the game as being, \u2018Oh these guys don\u2019t like each other\u2019, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\n\u201cCoaches, regardless of whether you\u2019re playing against their team or not, go through the same emotions. You spend a lot of time in the same mental space. It\u2019s a game of footy, it\u2019s not life or death. The closer you are the more you communicate. It\u2019s like when you play against your brother or your sister: it\u2019s important, but it\u2019s not life threatening.\n\n\u201cRugby is a special game. Those of us that have been around long enough understand the game is bigger than everybody else. It\u2019s the game that\u2019s more important than all the coaches and players.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest things about the game is the camaraderie,\u201d Hansen continued, \u201cnot only in your own team but that you get from being involved in a contest and sharing those moments and then moving on to the next one.\n\n\u201cThe game has been professional for a wee while but if you look back in time, and this is where history is important, teams always shared those moments after Tests together. It\u2019s something that is really important that we don\u2019t lose.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks suffered one minor injury blow in their victory over Ireland with the openside flanker Matt Todd aggravating a troublesome shoulder complaint.\n\nHansen indicated Todd was unlikely to recover for England, which could pave the way for the larger physical presence of Shannon Frizell, the more traditional blindside option, to take a spot on the bench.", "description": "All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen has revealed his deep respect for England\u2019s Eddie Jones after the duo swapped messages before next weekend\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final", "authors": ["Liam Napier At Tokyo Stadium"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad91d14bcd1b49b090786fb34fc5548f1da2a128/1115_581_2623_1573/master/2623.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96d7882adb4820c96e876c087abab4e0", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
