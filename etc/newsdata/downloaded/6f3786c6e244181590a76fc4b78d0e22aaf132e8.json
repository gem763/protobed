It will be very competitive.\n\n\u201cWe think the race is a great initiative and it is a privilege to be a part of it. Ryan knows the horse very well and we wanted him to ride the horse in The Everest.\u2019\u2019\n\nMoore is due to arrive in Sydney on Friday and he will be heartened to learn that Ten Sovereigns has thrived at Canterbury since his arrival last month.\n\nO\u2019Brien keeps in daily contact with his stable representatives in Sydney and believes Ten Sovereigns is in \u201cvery good shape\u201d for the rich Randwick race.\n\n\u201cThe horse he has travelled out well to Australia, the lads are very happy with him at the moment, and it is good to hear we will get a dry track,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien said.\n\nTen Sovereigns has won four of his seven starts and is regarded as one of Europe\u2019s premier sprinters.\n\nHe was a Group 1 winner as a two-year-old in the Middle Park Stakes and has returned at three to win the Group 1 July Cup when he monstered his rivals in the Newmarket sprint earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe think he is a very good colt,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe won our big, open-age sprint, the July Cup and we have always thought the world of this horse.\n\n\u201cWe know he is only a three-year-old and this is towards the end of the season for him but he seems to be in good form.\u2019\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien said Ten Sovereigns had legitimate excuses when only sixth to Battaash in the Group 1 Nunthorpe Stakes (a1000m) at York last start.\n\n\u201cHe missed the start in the York race, he was standing at the start and the race didn\u2019t work for him,\u2019\u2019 the trainer said.\n\nTen Sovereigns is the only international raider in a crack 12-horse Everest field that includes 10 individual Group 1 winners of 22 majors. Collectively, The Everest runners have earned more than $42 million prizemoney.\n\nThe sheer quality of the field is undeniable and because Ten Sovereigns has not raced in Australia, the colt is now the rank outsider at $31 for the big race.\n\nO\u2019Brien conceded the barrier draw had not been kind to Ten Sovereigns with the sprinter to come out of gate 11 but he is still expecting his colt to run a competitive race.\n\n\u201cIt is never ideal to be wide on a round track,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien said. \u201cBut this horse does go forward in his races, although he doesn\u2019t have to lead.\u2019\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien said Ten Sovereigns could stay on in Sydney to contest the $7.5 million Golden Eagle (1500m) at Rosehill Gardens on November 2.\n\nBut O\u2019Brien also revealed Coolmore plans to send out another promising northern hemisphere three-year-old, Never No More for the Golden Eagle.\n\n\u201cTen Sovereigns is a possibility to run in the Golden Eagle but it is also possible he could go to Melbourne,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\u201cHe nearly got a mile in the (2000) Guineas, he ran very well but then we decided to shorten him up (sprint distances) and he has been very comfortable. But we do have Never No More in quarantine to come to Sydney. He\u2019s a lovely straight forward horse.\u2019\u2019\n\nNever No More won a Guineas trial at Leopardstown earlier in the year but O\u2019Brien said a \u201clittle hold-up\u2019\u2019 prevented the colt from contesting the classics.\n\nO\u2019Brien said Never No More\u2019s good effort when a close second at Group 2 level at Doncaster last start has convinced them to send the colt to Sydney.\n\n\u201cNever No More ran very well at Doncaster and we have been happy with him since,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe think he has speed and almost gets a mile so we are hoping the race might suit him.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Irish training genius has also set his sights on the Melbourne spring carnival with Magic Wand set to contest the $5 million Cox Plate (2040m) at Moonee Valley on October 26, while Hunting Horn and Il Paradiso are Coolmore\u2019s big hopes for the $8 million Melbourne Cup (3200m) on November 2.\n\n\u201cMagic Wand is going to run in the Cox Plate and Hunting Horn might run in a race on Cox Plate Day (Moonee Valley Cup) before the Melbourne Cup,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIl Paradiso is going straight to the Melbourne Cup.\u2019\u2019\n\nCoolmore\u2019s main base is in Ireland but it has a huge racing and breeding presence in Australia where the booming prizemoney is the envy of the racing world.\n\n\u201cThe thoughts of everyone over here is that Australian racing is very progressive and is the place to be,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien said. \u201cYour sport is very healthy and is one of the most competitive race nations anywhere in the world.\u2019\u2019", "description": "Aidan O\u2019Brien, the Irishman many regard as the world\u2019s leading trainer, has endorsed the $14 million The TAB Everest by sending his stable jockey Ryan Moore down under to ride Ten Sovereigns in the world\u2019s richest turf race at Royal Randwick on Saturday.", "authors": ["Ray Thomas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e9fb6c58ef771c748fe152bb737fded9?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
