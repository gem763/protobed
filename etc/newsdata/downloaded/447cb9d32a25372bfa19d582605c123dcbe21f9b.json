Ankara considers the Kurdish forces to be \u201cterrorists\u201d linked to Kurdish rebels inside Turkey.\n\n\u201cIf the promises are kept until Tuesday evening, the safe zone issue will be resolved,\u201d Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul. \u201cIf it fails, the operation\u2026 will start the minute 120 hours are over.\u201d\n\nThe suspension of hostilities looked designed to help Turkey achieve its main territorial goals without fighting, but its Syrian proxies continued to clash with Kurdish fighters on Friday.\n\nFourteen civilians were killed in Turkish air strikes and mortar fire by allied Syrian fighters in and around the village of Bab al-Kheir, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\n\nThe Britain-based war monitor said eight fighters of the SDF \u2014 the de facto army of the embattled Kurdish autonomous region \u2014 also died.\n\n\u2013 No enforcement by US troops \u2013\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday there was also \u201csome very positive activity\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re hopeful in the hours ahead that both the Turks who were part of the agreement alongside of us as well as the YPG fighters in the region will take seriously the commitments they made,\u201d he told reporters in Brussels.\n\nUnder the deal, Kurdish forces are required to withdraw from a border strip 32 kilometres (20 miles) deep.\n\nPentagon chief Mark Esper said Friday that US troops were continuing their \u201cdeliberate withdrawal\u201d from northeast Syria.\n\n\u201cNo US ground forces will participate in the enforcement of this safe zone, however, we will remain in communication with both Turkey and the SDF,\u201d Esper said.\n\nA senior Pentagon official said US forces would carry out aerial reconnaissance of the \u201csafe zone\u201d with the goal of watching over prisons holding Islamic State fighters.\n\nThousands of IS fighters and their family members are held in Kurdish-run jails and camps across northern Syria.\n\nThe Kurds have said hundreds of IS-linked women and children have escaped a camp, while other reports have emerged of a handful of jihadist breakouts.\n\nThe prospect of thousands of the world\u2019s most radical jihadists escaping in the chaos caused by Turkey\u2019s invasion has caused widespread alarm.\n\nTrump said Friday that \u201csome\u201d European countries, which he did not name, \u201care now willing, for the first time, to take the (captured IS) Fighters that came from their nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is good news, but should have been done after WE captured them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Complicated region\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe Turkish offensive was sparked by Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal of US troops from Syria, a move that triggered fierce bipartisan criticism in Washington.\n\nKurdish forces have put up fierce resistance in Ras al-Ain, with a network of tunnels, berms and trenches that held off the Turkish onslaught for a week.\n\nThe Turkish military and its Syrian proxies \u2014 mostly Arab and Turkmen former rebels used as a ground force \u2014 have so far seized around 120 kilometres (70 miles) of territory along the border.\n\nMore than 500 people have been killed on the two sides, including nearly 100 civilians, while around 300,000 have been displaced, according to the Observatory.\n\nThe SDF fought alongside US forces to defeat IS in Syria and Iraq, but Trump has argued that it was no longer the US\u2019 role to ensure calm in the volatile area.", "description": "Tal Tamr (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has attacked President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops from Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/e9803f_kurdish-held-syrian-border-town-ras-al-ain-has-major-goal-turkish-offensive-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
