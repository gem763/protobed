Friday\u2019s big move was likely in response to the company\u2019s third-quarter revenue guidance of between $237 million and $241 million, far exceeding consensus analyst estimates of $231.9 million. DocuSign\u2019s full-year fiscal 2020 revenue guidance of between $947 million and $951 million also came in well ahead of consensus estimates of $920.3 million.\n\nSeveral analysts have weighed in on DocuSign\u2019s mixed quarter and huge guidance numbers. Here\u2019s a sampling of what they\u2019ve had to say.\n\nInflection Point\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Stan Zlotsky said the earnings report is a clear indication DocuSign is getting back on track.\n\n\u201cBig beat in Q2, Q3 billings guidance ahead of consensus expectations and tough comps, and full year billings outlook range moving up should all assuage investor fears of a protracted deceleration at DocuSign,\u201d Zlotsky wrote in a note.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives said billings and revenue growth were the highlights of the quarter.\n\n\u201cWe believe the company's e-signature value proposition and unmatched partner channel/API network this quarter illustrated why this company is in the early innings of a massive green field growth opportunity set to play out over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Rob Owens said the second quarter marks an inflection point for DocuSign\u2019s business.\n\nView more earnings on DOCU\n\n\u201cA positive inflection in revenue and billings growth is the culmination of increased momentum in e-signature, ramp in Agreement Cloud sales, and additional positive factors including its new federal contracts and strong growth in high ACV customers,\u201d Owens wrote.\n\nValuation A Concern\n\nBank of America analyst Kash Rangan said the strong report reaffirms DocuSign as the market leader in electronic signatures, but the stock\u2019s steep valuation is keeping him on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cBest in class SaaS companies (CRM, NOW, WDAY) at $1bn in revs have shown higher rev growth with significantly higher OM (10-14%) + FCF margins (11-23%),\u201d Rangan wrote.\n\nJMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens said DocuSign shares still look cheap trading at a projected 2020 EV/revenue multiple of just 9.2 times.\n\n\u201cWe believe DocuSign warrants a premium valuation due to its strong competitive position, attractive financial profile and impressive leadership team,\u201d Walravens wrote.\n\nRatings And Price Targets\n\nMorgan Stanley has an Overweight rating and $67 target.\n\nBank of America has a Neutral rating and $62 target.\n\nJMP has a Market Outperform rating and $70 target.\n\nWedbush has an Outperform rating and $65 target.\n\nKeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $65 target.\n\nThe stock traded around $54.77 per share at time of publication.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nA Step In The Right Direction: Cloudera Rallies After Impressive Q2 Earnings\n\nAnalysts Weigh In On MongoDB's Slowing Growth\n\nLatest Ratings for DOCU\n\nDate Firm Action From To Sep 2019 Maintains Overweight Sep 2019 Reiterates Neutral Sep 2019 Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for DOCU\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
