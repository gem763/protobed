It is quite surreal. I think you have to go back to Preben Elkj\u00e6r in the 80s to find someone with the same cult-hero status.\u201d\n\nThe striker, who has not played since 28 April, has started training and is expected to play his first game for the reserves against the club\u2019s arch-rivals Br\u00f8ndby on Tuesday. However, considering the level of interest in Bendtner\u2019s arrival and the fact that they are playing Br\u00f8ndby, the club have chosen to play the game without fans for security reasons.\n\n\u201cThis game is against Br\u00f8ndby and then it\u2019s war,\u201d said Solbakken. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible. We have to close it [for fans]. There would have been supporters from both sets of teams, meaning 3-4,000 fans for a reserve game. We can\u2019t house them there. Our training ground would have blown up.\u201d\n\nTV 2 SPORT (@TV2SPORTdk) Nicklas Bendtner brugte f\u00f8rste FCK-tr\u00e6ning p\u00e5 at indstille sigtekornet \ud83c\udfaf\u26bd\ufe0f #fcklive #sldk pic.twitter.com/1uzfwQgW80\n\nThe Denmark striker was convicted of assaulting a taxi driver and sentenced to 50 days in jail in November 2018, which he served with an electronic tag at his home in Denmark.
