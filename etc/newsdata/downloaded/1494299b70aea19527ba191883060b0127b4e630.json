While all the candidates were vying to be seen as a champion of LGBTQ rights, according to many people online, Warren came out on top.\n\nHow would I respond to someone who says marriage is between one man and one woman? #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/8uNXqXI5n7 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 11, 2019\n\nAt one point during the Equality town hall, Morgan Cox, chair of the Human Rights Campaign Board of Directors, challenged the presidential hopeful about how she would respond to an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d supporter whose faith teaches them that \u201cmarriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d Warren quickly replied: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that. And I\u2019m going to say, \u201cThen just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that,\u201d Warren nonchalantly replied, shrugging her shoulders.\n\nThe crowd immediately responded cheers and applause at her quick comeback but then, in a line that\u2019s being talked about all over social media, she replied: \u201c...Assuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nSince the town hall, a video clip of the moment has gone viral online with LGBTQ individuals, allies and celebrities alike retweeting the moment and singing her praises for her priceless responses, including retweets from Ellen Degeneres and support from prominent drag queens Jujubee and Trixie Mattel.\n\nWork bitch \u2014 Trixie Mattel (@trixiemattel) October 11, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team all-star Megan Rapinoe retweeted Warren\u2019s sassy one-liner with fire and laughing emoji\u2019s, and actress and activist Alyssa Milano tweeted that it \u201cmade [her] day,\u201d as late-night talk show host James Corden called the moment \u201csensational.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe TIMING. The DELIVERY. The TWINKLE IN HER EYE. I can\u2019t wait to see Elizabeth Warren wipe the debate stage with Donald Trump\u2019s haystack of a toupee,\u201d tweeted Sam Stryker, a former senior editor at Buzzfeed.\n\nEmily Andras, a Canadian TV producer and writer tweeted, \u201cGod give me an ounce of the wisdom, empathy and comic timing of Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone found the comeback to be a good one. Many conservative pundits and people of faith have spoken out to say that they do not appreciate Warren\u2019s zing, and believe she was mocking people of faith.\n\n\u201cWOW. Elizabeth Warren mocks religious people of faith about views on marriage,\u201d Tipping Point host Liz Wheeler tweeted. National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Matt Whitlock agreed. \u201cIn the same CNN town hall, Elizabeth Warren touted her faith, opining that \u2018hatred for people of faith can be shocking\u2019 but ALSO mocked religious traditional marriage supporters. That might be one of the more Warren things we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nWOW.

They are precious in his sight. Jesus loves all the children of the world,\u2019\u201d Warren addressed onstage after she was questioned about her own faith. \u201cThat is the basis of the faith that I grew up in.
