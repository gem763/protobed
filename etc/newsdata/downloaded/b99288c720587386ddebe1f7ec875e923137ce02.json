In other words, have we moved back to complacency? I don't think so.\n\nI think we have a tug of war going on right now. There are the bulls who are in what I would term the Fear of Missing Out -- or FOMO -- camp. They are afraid the market will rally without them over the course of the next two months, and they will need to \"make their year.\"\n\nThen there are the bears, who recall last year's fourth quarter. Or, they remember that each and every time we've tagged this 3000 area on the S&P 500, we have in fact not busted on through, but have retreated. Let's call them the Recency Bias Camp. Whatever has just happened recently, they expect to happen again.\n\nSo, these two groups are in a tug of war. And right now, it is my belief, that the FOMO bulls have tugged the Recency Bias bears over the line, but not by a lot. One or two more up days, and I think the Recency Bias bears will be pulled over further. And if that happens, we might just find ourselves back at complacency, just as we're getting short-term overbought again.\n\nOne reason I can see this happening is that the Volatility Index put/call ratio has been triple digits for two of the last three trading days. I was somewhat surprised to discover this doesn't happen very often. We'll get a high reading, but then won't get a second high reading for weeks. It is so atypical to get it so close, that I discovered in the last 10 years it's only happened eight times.\n\nWhat surprised me even more is that there were three outcomes trading-wise, but in the end, within two or three weeks, there was a pullback in stocks, and an up move in the VIX, every single time. The one exception was in the summer of 2016 when we went sideways for nearly a month or so before going back down.\n\nSometimes we rallied then pulled back. Sometimes we rallied then went sideways and then pulled back. And sometimes we just pulled back. Basically in every single instance, the VIX went up at some point in the ensuing weeks, proving the indicator as a contrary one.\n\nMost of the time, however, the pullbacks were just pullbacks, kept to a few percentage points -- that would be in keeping with the sentiment tug of war. Big declines in the market tend to come when complacency is high, not when it's still a tug of war.\n\nAll of this is in keeping with the indicators that have been mixed and remain mixed.", "description": "In this market tug of war, the bulls fear the market will rally without them, while the bears fret about last year's fourth quarter and that every time we've tagged 3000 on the S&amp;P 500, we have retreated.", "authors": ["Helene Meisler", "Here'S How The Bulls Could Pull Over The Bears", "The Bulls Worry The Market Will Rally Without Them", "While The Bears Fret About Last Year'S Fourth Quarter", "The S P Tagging -- But What If We Have Some Up Days", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Bruce Kamich", "Mark Sebastian"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/15abd912-b02d-11e7-8ef6-b954c70cd1c7.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
