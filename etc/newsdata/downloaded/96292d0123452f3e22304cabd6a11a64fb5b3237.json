Instead of offering some encouraging words or kindness after the tragic loss of life, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) thought it\u2019d be best to go the sarcastic route, taking a jab at all those gun owners who\u2019ve used their firearm for good.\n\nThe comment came after Swalwell retweeted a message from Beto O\u2019Rourke that said \u201cBuy them all back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeto is spot on,\u201d the California Democrat said. \u201cIf you believe assault weapons are dangerous, it\u2019s irresponsible to support a ban on future sales but grandfather in possession of the 15 million already in our communities. Either they\u2019re dangerous & should be taken off the streets or don\u2019t ban them at all.\u201d\n\nBeto is spot on.

You know who you are. Thanks a million,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201c*btw, Texas IS an open carry state.\u201d\n\nBig shout out to all the civilian \u201cgood guys with guns\u201d who saved lives in Odessa.

Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) September 1, 2019\n\nContrary to whatever world Swalwell lives in, \"good guys with guns\" are real and there are countless stories about guns saving lives every day that rarely get the attention they deserve. One that recently did, however, took place in Springfield, Missouri, where an off-duty fireman likely prevented a mass shooting at a Walmart--just days after the shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed.", "description": ".09/02/2019 20:02:13PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/94a3cd3e-eeea-4657-94c2-97e02f23676f.png"}
