Shortly after this otherwise stern, dour sci-fi deals one of film history\u2019s least expected needle drops in the bouncy form of Keri Hilson\u2019s Pretty Girl Rock, we cut to the daft but oddly affecting sight of Pattinson, playing a gauzy-eyed simpleton at the mercy of the wilderness, sitting in a darkened car and singing softly along to the song\u2019s cocky, skittering R&B beat: \u201cAll eyes on me when I walk in / No question that this girl\u2019s a ten / Don\u2019t hate me \u2018cause I\u2019m beautiful / Don\u2019t hate me \u2019cause I\u2019m beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe Lighthouse review \u2013 Robert Pattinson shines in sublime maritime nightmare Read more\n\nIn an otherwise strenuously masculine film, this small moment of unabashed camp is delicious, winking as it does at the young, predominantly female fanbase that followed Pattinson from the Twilight films into artier, more eccentric realms. But it also acknowledges his unusual, anti-macho star image: Pattinson is beautiful, in a willowy, alabaster, slightly aloof way that Hollywood doesn\u2019t tend to seek in leading men, though it couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for the goth androgyny of vampire romantic Edward Cullen.\n\nThe original millennial softboy before the next generation took up that phrase in earnest, Pattinson\u2019s dreamboat allure was defined by a degree of embedded femininity, a vulnerable beauty \u2013 and indeed, pace Hilson, some did hate him for it. In certain male-led quarters of the internet, hating Twilight and its fangirl following was a fixation for several years: the common line on Pattinson became that he was a wan, ineffectual pretty-boy who couldn\u2019t act. The coarsest version of this teasing, of course, was confined to sweaty incel-net forums, yet it trickled into film criticism too \u2013 egged on, at the zenith of Cullenmania, by non-Twilight script choices that played unabashedly to his besotted fans. Water for Elephants, Bel Ami and Remember Me were hardly great films, yet critics laid into their lush, feminine romanticism with unseemly glee.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Pattinson in Cosmopolis.

Sure enough, it was only when Pattinson started playing the latter game that he started getting some respect: in 2012, when he scowled and suited up for David Cronenberg\u2019s terse, chilly adaptation of Don DeLillo\u2019s Cosmopolis, the \u201cR-Pattz can act!\u201d headlines duly followed. This wasn\u2019t a revelation to those who had noticed his subtly self-mocking, script-defying intensity in the Twilight, or even his game matinee-idol flexing in Water for Elephants; the context was just a little more acceptable.\n\nRather like his Twilight co-star and ex-girlfriend Kristen Stewart \u2013 herself the brunt of insistent, tedious \u201ccan\u2019t act\u201d criticism as punishment for the franchise \u2013 Pattinson thus took the arthouse route to elevating his reputation, picking ever more challenging roles in ever more idiosyncratic auteur projects: from the aforementioned The Rover to James Gray\u2019s The Lost City of Z, from Brady Corbet\u2019s The Childhood of a Leader to the Safdie Brothers\u2019 Good Time. His leading role as a frenzied, worn-to-the-bone lighthouse keeper\u2019s apprentice in Robert Eggers\u2019 marvellous maritime nightmare The Lighthouse is a perfect example. His beauty, still present, is hollowed out and exhausted in harsh monochrome, pockmarked and saddled with scraggly sailor\u2019s moustache: Whether beating up seagulls or raging through ugly exchanges of deep-stewed 19th-century seadog vernacular, it\u2019s a role that, on the face of it, seems all but tailored for someone trying to shed a teen-idol stigma.\n\nYet look closer at these roles and performances, and Pattinson\u2019s elegant reshaping of his own stardom looks a little less plainly reactive, and more like a subversion: the softness is still there, just in harder surroundings. In the caffeinated, tarmac-pounding New York heist thriller Good Time, he\u2019s cast seemingly against type as a crude, scuzzy, coked-up fuckup, though as his character\u2019s rickety criminal plans fall apart from the get-go, his gaping, unloved vulnerability is as glaring as his peroxided hair. In Claire Denis\u2019s ingenious sensual space odyssey High Life, he\u2019s an introverted, celibate criminal turned tenderly doting father, though only through being summarily raped by Juliette Binoche\u2019s controlling astrophysicist; joining victimhood and paternal protectiveness in one fraught swoop, it\u2019s a character arc unlike that of any male protagonist in the movies.\n\nEven in The Lighthouse, Pattinson\u2019s gnarled, calloused performance is principally characterised by helpless, flailing defeat. He\u2019s cultivated a rich, riveting line in outwardly hardened men a little too beautiful, a little too fragile, for the harsher worlds in which they find themselves \u2013 upending expectations of what a leading man can do, or more pointedly can\u2019t do, on screen. And now the multiplex comes calling again: seven years after the Twilight saga concluded and liberated its young stars from studio franchise handcuffs, he\u2019s signed up for the umpteenth reboot of The Batman, with a leading role in Christopher Nolan\u2019s latest action whirligig Tenet to come before then.\n\nPattinson\u2019s arthouse dabblings have potentially prepared him well to play Bruce Wayne, the superhero with a more human, angsty backstory than the rest of them, even if many of those to play him over years \u2013 Christian Bale\u2019s clenched, ungiving Dark Knight included \u2013 have been loth to dwell on his weaknesses. Could Pattinson be the softboy Batman we haven\u2019t yet seen, or a flawed manchild to match Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s revised Joker? Fanboys certainly fear so: it felt like the clock had been turned back to the early 2010s when the casting news was announced, and basement-dwelling geeks seized on Twitter to protest that the erstwhile Edward Cullen (still) \u201ccan\u2019t act\u201d, and that he isn\u2019t macho or invulnerable enough to play their beloved caped crusader. On the latter charge, Pattinson has amply cleared himself; on the former, the trolls might be more right than they know.", "description": "Twilight\u2019s high school heartthrob has became an indie mainstay but will his newfound niche survive after he takes on the role of Batman?", "authors": ["Guy Lodge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecd66f08728c728130549e5a59297a47a84cb465/0_187_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f5ad1cbc200854239bd4382190688664", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
