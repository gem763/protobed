The report comes short of singling out Huawei for its ties to the Chinese government, but notes that suppliers with a \u201cstrong link\u201d to governments \u201cwhere there are no legislative or democratic checks and balances in place\u201d could present major security threats. It also flags the need to diversify so one supplier isn\u2019t managing all aspects of a network, such as hardware, software and operations. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: The EU has resisted calls to join the U.S. in banning Huawei from supplying equipment and infrastructure for its 5G networks. However, member countries may look to the commission\u2019s report as justification for banning\u2014or at least limiting\u2014Huawei\u2019s involvement. In response to the report, the EU will now build a \u201ctoolbox\u201d to address the risks the commission identified, due by year\u2019s end. Canada, meanwhile, is currently undertaking its own risk assessment on 5G, which will inform its decision on whether or not to ban Huawei.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
