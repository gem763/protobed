We've got a mind-warping \"yes\" but not quite \"no\".\n\nImage copyright David Becker/Getty Images Image caption The airbase which has been associated with aliens\n\nWhat is AlienStock?\n\nYou might remember the Storm Area 51 Facebook event which went viral back in July. A \"hoax\" or \"satirical\" call to gather at the airbase.\n\nThe creator of that was due to launch a music festival, called AlienStock, in the town of Rachel - with a population of 87.\n\nOn seeing his social media prank turn into an internet sensation, Matty Roberts, 21, decided to create an actual event scheduled to take place on 20-22 September.\n\nNow he says it's cancelled and claims it's for safety reasons and wanting to avoid creating another Fyre Fest - the world's most infamous festival flop.\n\nThis view was repeated in a statement on the organiser's website that claimed there was a \"lack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard\" for the safety of the expected 10,000 attendees.\n\n\"We foresee a possible humanitarian disaster in the works, and we can't participate in any capacity at this point,\" they wrote.\n\n\"We just don't want anyone to get injured or stuck in the middle of the desert,\" they added.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The festival was due to take place in the small town of Rachel, Nevada\n\nSo it's clearly off?\n\nThe official event isn't going ahead.\n\nBut Connie West, a bar owner in the town who signed up as a key partner, says a festival is \"still happening\".\n\n\"I'm going to do it on my scale,\" she told KVVU-TV - a television news outlet in Nevada.\n\n\"It is what it is... if [Matty Roberts] chooses to go somewhere else, that's his choice.\"\n\n\"I'm still having a party because people are still coming to Rachel.\"\n\nAnd according to Connie West's event site, there will be a line-up of local bands looking to beam attendees into musical space.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Area 51 is often the focus of alien-related conspiracy theories\n\nAny other ways to get your supernatural freak-on?\n\nMatty Roberts has decided to help host an alien-themed club night in Las Vegas on 19 September instead.\n\nHe revealed on Facebook that his event had been renamed the \"Area 51 celebration\".\n\nSo yes, that's two pieces of top-secret alien entertainment taking place in Nevada.\n\nHopefully though, they all come in peace...\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Confusion over whether AlienStock is still happening in Nevada?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1823A/production/_108747889_gettyimages-1128874019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
