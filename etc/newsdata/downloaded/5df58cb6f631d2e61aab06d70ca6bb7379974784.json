Andrew Cuomo, of New York, said he disagrees with the court\u2019s decision and is evaluating aoptions including an appeal.\n\n\"The bottom line is this policy is unprecedented, unlawful, punitive and politically motivated \u2014 and it must be stopped,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said her office was considering all of its options, as well.\n\nJoe Pizzimenti, a tax director specializing in state and local tax services at Margolin, Winer & Evens, told FOX Business he would be surprised if New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland let the court\u2019s decision end their quest to have the cap lifted.\n\n\u201cI would be surprised if they don\u2019t go up the federal court system and perhaps even after that if they lose,\u201d Pizzimenti said.\n\nPizzimenti, who anticipated the court\u2019s ruling, said he believes this issue has a better chance of being resolved through legislative action, not judicial.\n\nThe four states sued the Treasury Department in July 2018. The government had asked for the suit to be dismissed.\n\nEarlier this year, the IRS officially struck down a strategy of classifying property tax payments as charitable donations to help residents evade the SALT cap. There is legislation floating around Capitol Hill to undo the provision, however, it is unlikely to pass while Republicans retain control in the Senate.\n\nMeanwhile, as previously reported by FOX Business, the provision of the Republican tax law is one the administration is hoping to extend past 2025 \u2013 when it is currently set to expire. A potential extension would be part of a Tax Cuts 2.0 package that White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said the administration is aiming to put out around the middle of next year.\n\nTrump has slammed high-tax states, particularly New York, over its tax laws \u2013 saying they are causing people and businesses to flee the state in \u201crecord numbers.\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in Nov. 2017 that he hoped changes to the SALT deduction would send a message to state governments to \u201cget their budgets in line,\u201d questioning why they needed state taxes as high as 13 percent.\n\nThe cap has caused an exodus of residents from high-tax states to states with lower or no statewide taxes. The average SALT deduction claimed in California is $22,000, according to Kevin de Leon, a Democratic member of the California Senate.\n\nFlorida received more movers than any other state last year, New York's outflows to the Sunshine State were the highest \u2013 63,772 people. New York had the third-largest outflows of any state, with 452,580 people moving out within the past year.\n\nNew York\u2019s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he expects the cap on state and local tax deductions to have a negative impact on the state\u2019s population \u2013 and tax receipts. He blamed a $2.3 billion budget deficit on the new tax law, calling the state\u2019s financial situation \u201cas serious as a heart attack\u201d as wealthy residents leave.\n\nMeanwhile, the exodus from high-tax states may continue to heat up. Many experts told FOX Business they saw a spike in inquiries about establishing a new domicile during tax season, when taxpayers began to see the financial repercussions before their eyes.\n\nThe financial benefits of moving from a high-tax state to a low-tax state can be substantial. Individuals earning $650,000 can save more than $69,700 in taxes per year by moving from New York to the Sunshine State.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "New York\u2019s Democratic Gov.
