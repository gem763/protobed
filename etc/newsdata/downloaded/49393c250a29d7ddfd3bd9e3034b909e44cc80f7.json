But for David Quessenberry it represented a long journey.\n\nQuessenberry, a Tennessee Titans offensive lineman, scored the most emotional one-yard touchdown of the day as the big man, who has overcome non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, caught a scoring pass from Marcus Mariota on a tackle-eligible play in the third quarter of a 19-17 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nCancer survivor David Quessenberry just scored a \ud83d\udea8BIG MAN TOUCHDOWN!\ud83d\udea8\n\nAwesome moment. #INDvsTEN@Titans | #Titans\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa : CBS\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app\n\nWatch on mobile: https://t.co/QyaknqVhhg pic.twitter.com/DGMOUmqAug \u2014 NFL (@NFL) September 15, 2019\n\nA sixth-round draft pick by the Houston Texans in 2013, Quessenberry\u2019s cancer was diagnosed in June 2014 and he returned to the Texans in 2017 with the disease in remission. He spent last season on Tennessee\u2019s practice squad. He grew close to Tennessee Coach Mike Vrabel and Vrabel\u2019s son Tyler, now an offensive lineman for Boston College, when Mike Vrabel was Houston\u2019s defensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cI watched him rehab and he took my son, who was changing positions and being an offensive lineman, and he would work out with him,\u201d Vrabel said in 2018 (per ESPN). \u201cI would walk in the weight room and Quess would be in there with Tyler trying to help him as this guy\u2019s recovering from cancer. When you have those type of guys that have the ability and they\u2019re also a quality person, it makes it an easy thing to add them to your team.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nFor the first time in his career, Aaron Rodgers is wearing a play sheet on his wrist\n\nWho\u2019s Gardner Minshew II?
