He\u2019s on a one-way ticket to nowhere.\"\n\nThe source said that Gemma stood by Arg when he went to rehab in the past but now he is 'refusing to go.\"\n\n\"She's told him she will no be with him until he sorts himself out,\" they claimed.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nArg, 31, is expected to fly out to Spain next week to perform, despite pals worrying his partying is spiralling out of control.\n\nHe said of the incident on Thursday: \"I wasn't speaking to a certain person so I didn't reply. They became concerned and called the police and ambulance. They turned up and checked on me. They came up to my room to make sure I was fine.\n\n\"My parents were already there. Then this person must have called again and the ambulance turned up at around 4pm and we had a quick chat on the doorstep. He said it was a lovely house.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"I wasn't speaking to this person for a reason and they were worried about my safety because I wasn't answering the phone. I was perfectly fine, we all had a chat and carried on the day with my parents, we were just hanging up pictures.\"\n\nArg added: \u201cThe police and paramedics were only here for about ten minutes. I'm slightly embarrassed really. I apologise for any wasted police time as I was absolutely fine.\"\n\nIn a statement, Metropolitan Police said: \"Police were called at 13.11hrs to a residential address following concerns for the welfare of male occupant. Officers attended with LAS [London Ambulance Service]. The male, in his 30s, was spoken to. He was left in the company of family.\n\n\"Officers were called at 16.21hrs to the same address, again due to concerns for the same male's welfare. The male declined assistance.\"\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\nAfter years of brief couplings up, Arg officially declared his love for TOWIE co-star Gemma in 2017 in the show's Christmas special.\n\nBut the following year Gemma appeared to cool off with an appearance on Celebs Go Dating.\n\nAfter she failed to find lasting love on the E4 dating show Gemma got back together with Arg in 2018.\n\nHe supported her through her stint on Dancing on Ice this year, but the pair have got together and split many times since following a series of rows.\n\nMirror Online has contacted reps of Gemma and Arg for comment.", "description": "Gemma Collins has told her TOWIE co-star it's over for good this time as she fears 'drugs could kill him'", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Rex", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Splashnews.Com", "Wireimage", "Instagram", "Supplied Wenn"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663600.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-30-Apr-2018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
