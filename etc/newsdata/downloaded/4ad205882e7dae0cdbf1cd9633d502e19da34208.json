'It's a big opportunity for us on Tuesday. We must use that.\n\n'Then Sunday is a big opportunity. Look, we're a team, let's go again. Let's go, like that second half. Our best, it's all we can do.'\n\nDele Alli scored a late equaliser to stop Tottenham from losing against Watford on Saturday\n\nUnder-fire boss Mauricio Pochettino, meanwhile, refused to say whether the club would delve into the January transfer market to solve any of their problems.\n\n'I am clear with you. I don't say yes or no,' he said after the draw. 'I don't say we are going to sign or not sign, sell or not sell.\n\n'It is not the moment to talk, when the time arrives we are going to take that decision in one way or another.\n\n'Now is the time to stay all together, all of the squad, with the staff and the fans and try and change the atmosphere.\n\nMauricio Pochettino remained coy when asked if he'd sign players in January amid struggles\n\n'We are not going to get any benefit to talk about January, it is too far away, we have got a lot of games to play.\n\n'That is the structure of the club that is working and thinking and they need to be ready if we need to do something, if not we keep going, but I am happy with the squad, I am happy with the players.\n\n'Like always, what is going to happen in January I cannot guess today, what happens will happen.'", "description": "Things do not appear to be getting any easier for Spurs with a Champions League game against Red Star Belgrade followed by a trip to Anfield, but Alderweireld is determined to remain positive.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/10/19983208-0-image-a-17_1571649255584.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
