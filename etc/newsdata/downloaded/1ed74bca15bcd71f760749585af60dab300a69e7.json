an attempt to move the focus on the party from Brexit to something else entirely.\n\nThe DUP, for its part, says it has consistently called for the return of Stormont - and says any MLA opposed to abortion law reform should \"step outside party shackles\" and join them in recalling the assembly.\n\nBut would recalling the assembly stop the law changing?\n\nNo it wouldn't.\n\nFirstly, recalling the Stormont assembly is a rare occurrence in itself.\n\nThe power rests with the assembly speaker - not the secretary of state - and they must receive a request from at least 30 MLAs to have the assembly recalled.\n\nThe DUP has 28 MLAs, but the speaker (currently the DUP's Robin Newton) cannot sign a petition for the assembly to be recalled.\n\nTherefore, three MLAs from other parties would need to back the proposal too.\n\nIndependent unionist MLA Claire Sugden tweeted that she would back such a move.\n\nFurthermore, the terms of the legislation which set out the conditions for abortion law reform and same-sex marriage coming into Northern Ireland require more than just the assembly being recalled.\n\nThe Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act specifically states that positions within the Stormont Executive must be filled on or before 21 October 2019, in order for the new laws not to take effect.\n\nIt is also understood the first order of business in any return of the assembly would be the election of a new speaker.\n\nSo even if the DUP managed to get enough MLAs to back a recall this week or on Monday, the chances of nominating and naming new executive ministers in order to squash the terms of the Westminster laws seems pretty slim.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sinn F\u00e9in has given no indication it is willing to nominate ministers to the Stormont power-sharing executive\n\nIt would require the biggest nationalist party - currently Sinn F\u00e9in - to nominate some ministers to the power-sharing executive, and there is no indication it is willing to do so.\n\nWhere do talks to restore Stormont come into this?\n\nSince the Northern Ireland Act was passed by MPs, all-party talks to restore Stormont have mostly fallen by the wayside.\n\nSome commentators believe Sinn F\u00e9in and other Stormont parties in favour of the law changing on those issues are content to wait it out until after 21 October, to allow those reforms to happen and see them removed from the wider talks process.\n\nHowever, in the past couple of weeks, Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith was pushing for fresh talks ahead of the 21 October deadline, arguing it was better for the Stormont parties to legislate on such matters.\n\nHe is due to chair 11th hour \"intensive\" cross-party talks on Thursday and Friday at Stormont.\n\nIt is not clear how the DUP's bid for the assembly to be recalled might impact those discussions.\n\nBut given the negative reaction from some party sources already to the DUP's recall proposition, a breakthrough of any kind at Stormont in the near future seems unlikely.", "description": "Sinn F\u00e9in dubs the move to recall the Northern Ireland Assembly a \"political stunt\".", "authors": ["Jayne Mccormack", "Bbc News Ni Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4A28/production/_109248981_gettyimages-1167234358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
