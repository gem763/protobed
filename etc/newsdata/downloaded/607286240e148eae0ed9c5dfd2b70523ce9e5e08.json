Roem has been hailed as the first transgender woman elected as a state legislator.\n\nThe Daily Mail picked up on the Sunday Times story that focused on the generation gap between mother and daughter when it comes to embracing the homosexual agenda:\n\nIt may appear Hillary and Chelsea Clinton always see eye-to-eye, but in a recent interview one topic cracked the facade of the like-minded mother-daughter power duo. The one issue Hillary and Chelsea don\u2019t appear to agree on entirely is transgender self-identification. In an interview with the Sunday Times, journalist Decca Aitkenhead asked the Clintons if someone with a beard and a penis can ever be a woman, to which Chelsea replied emphatically, \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\nBut Aitkenhead reported that Hillary seemed \u201cuneasy\u201d about the subject.\n\n\u201cErrr. I\u2019m just learning about this,\u201d Hillary said. \u2018It\u2019s a very big generational discussion, because this is not something I grew up with or ever saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot more time and effort to understand what it means to be defining yourself differently,\u201d Hillary said.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported.\n\nAccording Aitkenhead\u2019s account, she tells Hillary during the interview that many British feminists of Hillary\u2019s generation have a problem with the idea that a \u2018lesbian who doesn\u2019t want to sleep with someone who has a penis is transphobic. The journalist then adds that many women of Hillary\u2019s generation are uncomfortable with biological males sharing women\u2019s bathrooms.\n\n\u201cI would say that, absolutely,\u201d Hillary said. \u201cAbsolutely. Yes.\u201d\n\nChelsea, meanwhile, expressed approval of the British National Health Service\u2019s decision to assign patients to single sex wards based on their gender identity instead of their biological sex.\n\n\u201cHow can you treat someone if you don\u2019t recognize who they feel and know in their core they are?\u201d Chelsea said. \u201cAnd I strongly support children being able to play on the sports teams that match their own gender identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we need to be doing everything we can to support kids in being whoever they know themselves to be and discovering who they are,\u201d Chelsea said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "An interview with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton about their new book revealed that they may not agree on transgenderism.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Hillary-and-Chelsea-Promote-Book-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
