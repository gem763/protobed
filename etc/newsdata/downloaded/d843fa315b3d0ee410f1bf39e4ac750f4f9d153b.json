I lie on my back to count shooting stars and while I wait for the next streak of light, I mark the passage of time by watching the constellations slowly wheel overhead.\n\nIt\u2019s my birthday next month and I wonder which of the millions of stars I\u2019m looking at is far enough away that its light left the year I was born and is only reaching the Earth at that very moment. When you\u2019re alone with the stars, it\u2019s easy to start thinking about time and the tiny place you take up in a vast universe.\n\nGrasslands National Park has a way of making you stop to think about the big picture. Located in the south of Saskatchewan, not far from the border with the United States, the vast, 907 square-kilometre park is actually made up of two non-contiguous parcels of land, the East Block and the West Block, and while the two are meant to preserve mixed-grass prairie ecosystems, they both offer noticeably different experiences to visitors.\n\nThe West Block is known for its virgin prairie landscape that supports bison and prairie dog populations while the East Block is a wilder area that features stunning badlands that look like scenery from a cowboy movie.\n\nMy first day in the park is in the East Block where I am awed by the rolling hills and the distant horizons. Anyone who thinks Saskatchewan is boring and flat has never spent any time admiring the beauty of the big sky over Grasslands.\n\nVisitors who stay here can camp in the park\u2019s campground, either in their own tents, trailers or RVs, or rent one of the park\u2019s oTENTiks. I choose to sleep my first night in a tipi, one of a half dozen that the park rents out in the East Block. It uses modern materials, but is erected in traditional Sioux style with 13 long support poles.\n\nI sleep in a sleeping bag on a cot with a pillow and a camping mattress which is surprisingly comfortable, but the wind makes the walls flap like a sail and the sound wakes me frequently. The consolation is that I get to peek at the stars shining down above my head through the hole where the poles emerge from the tipi. I\u2019m awake for good once the sun rises as the constant yipping and howling of coyotes in the nearby brush rouses me from my dreams.\n\nDuring an interpretive walk with a Parks Canada guide, we learn that tipis like these were commonly used by the First Nations people that lived here long before Europeans arrived. Our walk takes us past a circle of rocks that was once used by an Indigenous family to weigh down the sides of their tipi. Known as tipi rings, we\u2019re told that more than 2,500 of such rings have been documented throughout the park, some of which are centuries old, while others are thousands of years old.\n\nEverything changed for the Indigenous people once European settlers began arriving in this area. Our walk takes us past the remnants of a century-old homestead that once belonged to a pair of brothers who tried to farm the valley we are in. All that\u2019s left is a hole in the ground, overgrown with grasses and brush. A metal stove that they used to keep themselves warm during the harsh prairie winters remains is all that is left to mark the few years they spent here.\n\nIt feels like we are travelling back to that era when we take a horseback ride through the park with Teresa Broeder of Gold Willow Ranch. She leads us city slickers on a late afternoon ride over hills and across coulees towards the Valley of a Thousand Devils in the park\u2019s badlands. As the wind blows over the stalks of undulating grass below us, it looks like we are wading across an ocean of green and yellow.\n\nAfter our ride, we enjoy a steak dinner cooked on one of the park\u2019s communal propane barbeques and settle in for an evening singalong while we eat bannock baked on a campfire. While we try to remember the words to the songs that we\u2019re singing, we automatically reach for our phones to look up the lyrics online, but that\u2019s when you remember that at Grasslands, cellular phone coverage in the park is sketchy at best.\n\nThat turns out to be a good thing since being disconnected from the world lets you appreciate this place and this moment in time. Instead of checking for notifications on your phone, you can look at the scenery, feel the wind in your face, smell the sagebrush around you and free your mind to think about time and the big picture.\n\nA few days later, we drive to the West Block. Along the way, we stop in the town of Val Marie, a classic Saskatchewan farming town that has a Chinese restaurant on the main street and where the tallest building is towering grain elevator at the edge of town. It\u2019s the hometown of NHL legend Bryan Trottier and it feels like we\u2019ve been travelling back in time again.\n\nThe landscape in the West Block is more gentle and we walk through a black-tailed prairie dog colony. The park has several such colonies and is the only place in Canada where you can see these endangered animals. They are easy enough to watch as they stand like sentinels on the edge of their holes. If you get too close, they chirp out warnings to their neighbours then dart to safety underground.\n\nThe park is home to several other threatened and endangered species like the burrowing owl, greater sage grouse and swift fox, but we see none of them during our time here. What we do see is a lone male bison in a valley near the prairie dog colony. He\u2019s likely a young bull that\u2019s been kicked out of the herd by more dominant males. A short drive away, we tour the park\u2019s bison facility where we learn about how they manage a herd of plains bison that was introduced to the park in 2006, bringing back a species that once would have ranged here in vast numbers before being hunted nearly to extinction by settlers.\n\nIt\u2019s too late for the dinosaurs that once lived here. They\u2019ve been extinct for millions of years. We learn about them during our hike out to 70 Mile Butte, the highest place in the park. From the summit, we look out at the valley below that was carved out by retreating glaciers during the last Ice Age. As we walk in the hot sun, we learn that we are periodically stepping on rocks that are actually fossilized bone fragments from the animals that lived here millions of years ago when this was the Bearpaw Sea.\n\nAs we look at the nearby buttes that were carved out during the Ice Age, we can see the coloured layers that represent different eras of geologic time that came before, like the Cretaceous-Palogene boundary which signals the moment when an asteroid smashed into the Earth, wiping out the dinosaurs.\n\nThe next night, when I look at the stars above Grasslands, which also happens to be Canada\u2019s darkest Night Sky Preserve, I think about all that these celestial guardians have witnessed below and the arrow of time that stretches behind me. These are the same stars that rose above the settlers that first came here; the First Nations that came before them and the bison they followed; the Ice Ages that formed this landscape and the dinosaurs buried beneath it. My hope is that the stars will continue to rise above this special land long after we\u2019ve moved on and that those that come after will be able to enjoy it for generations to come.\n\n\u2013 The author was a guest of Destination Canada and Tourism Saskatchewan, neither of which read or approved this article before publication.\n\n\u2013 Mark Stachiew is a Montreal-based freelance writer who shares travel news and tips at www.stachiew.com and curates a collection of cool travel gear at www.jetsetgeneration.com.", "description": "Grasslands National Park has a way of making you stop to think about the big picture.", "authors": ["Updated", "October"], "top_image": "https://postmediacanadadotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/grasslands3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
