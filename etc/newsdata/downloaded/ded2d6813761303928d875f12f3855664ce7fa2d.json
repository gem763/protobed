Rand Paul (R-KY) said during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Wednesday that basketball star LeBron James should stand up for freedom of speech in Hong Kong, instead of siding with the Chinese Communist regime who is trying to brutally suppress it.\n\nAfter Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey prompted a backlash from China and the National Basketball Association (NBA) after he tweeted in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, James criticized Morey for not being \u201ceducated\u201d when he spoke and suggested that criticizing China could hurt the NBA financially.\n\nAsked what he would tell James, Paul \u2014 a libertarian staunchly against communism \u2014 said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019d say, LeBron, it\u2019s time to step up, understand what your country\u2019s about, understand what made our country great, which is freedom. Being allowed to speak, being allowed to be treated equally regardless of your race, these are great things about our country \u2014 and they don\u2019t have them in China.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should stand up. And it shouldn\u2019t be about making a buck in China. Because frankly, there are a lot of people in our country who make a lot less than LeBron James, but they\u2019re willing to stand up for freedom of speech and the people in Hong Kong and I think if LeBron would think about it, then maybe he could stand up and do something to help the people of Hong Kong,\u201d he added.\n\nPaul recently authored The Case Against Socialism, which delves into how socialism has killed millions in China and all over the world, but is growing in popularity on the left in America.\n\nThe book cover\u2019s inside flap reads, \u201cSocialist dictatorships like the People\u2019s Republic of China crush freedom of speech and run massive surveillance sates while masquerading as enlightened modern nations. Far from providing economic freedom, socialist governments enslave their citizens.\u201d\n\nAsked about the NBA\u2019s response to Morey\u2019s tweet, Paul said, \u201cIt makes me sad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think of when the world sort of rallied against apartheid\u2026and the world came together and said we\u2019re going to boycott. College students got together, and it was sort of actually \u2014 sort of a proud moment that people voluntarily changed the world by getting rid of apartheid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a weakness for LeBron James or the NBA. Look, I\u2019m all for money, I\u2019m all for capitalism, but they\u2019re whining they might lose a little money from China,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think LeBron James could live with a couple million less? He probably makes 80 to 100 million a year, you know?\u201d\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Paul said LeBron James should stand up for freedom of speech in Hong Kong, instead of siding with the Chinese Communist regime.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1180610358-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
