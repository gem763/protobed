There have been far worse altercations occurred in the Rose Garden and by members of the press in the past.\u201d\n\nKarem, the magazine\u2019s senior White House correspondent, is suing President Donald Trump and White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham in an attempt to overturn a 30-day suspension of his hard pass, a long-term credential that allows journalists to enter and leave the White House with relative ease.\n\nGrisham imposed the suspension after a high-profile altercation with conservative radio talk show host Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump White House aide, at an event in the Rose Garden in July. The two men traded insults, which were caught on video and quickly went viral. Karem was heard saying, \u201cThis is a group of people who are eager for demonic possession.\u201d In turn, Gorka was heard saying: \u201cYou\u2019re not a journalist \u2014 you\u2019re a punk!\u201d\n\nKarem\u2019s suit accuses Grisham of violating his due process rights by revoking his pass based on unwritten rules. A federal judge in Washington is expected to make a decision on whether to restore Karem\u2019s pass in the days ahead.\n\nIn the interview, Karem \u2014 with Ted Boutrous, his attorney \u2014 countered Stelter\u2019s suggestion that his conduct at the White House event seemed unprofessional by saying that it was only true of the White House\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u201cYou cannot sanction actions by one and then make OK the actions of the other in that type of environment,\u201d Karem said.\n\nBoutrous, who filed a suit that got CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s pass restored last year after it was revoked by the White House, said many of the arguments he made in court this week on Karem's behalf were the same as those made in Acosta\u2019s case. Boutrous reiterated that Karem\u2019s pass was suspended \u201cout of the blue\u201d and that the decision was \u201cbased on nonexistent standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is part of a war by President Trump and his new press secretary, Ms. Grisham, to try to squelch and intimidate reporters from asking tough questions at the White House,\u201d Boutros said. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is. It violates the First Amendment. It violates due process, and they\u2019re trying to send a message to other reporters there in the Rose Garden, \u2018Watch out, we\u2019ll do this to you.\u2019\u201d\n\nKarem told Stelter the White House\u2019s actions reflected an anti-press agenda.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this administration, they\u2019re never going to come at you straight on, Brian,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re never going to come at you and say, \u2018Hey look, we don't agree with the First Amendment.' They\u2019re going to come at you sideways.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Suspended journalist Brian Karem accuses the Trump administration of mistreating the press.", "authors": ["Bianca Quilantan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3pV8nmjjvJZnPow5NVqszQ--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/0c24e04b266dffd1d161eb8363aa5366"}
