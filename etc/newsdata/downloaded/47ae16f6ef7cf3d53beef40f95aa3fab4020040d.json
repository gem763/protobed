When your entire house is rumbling \u2013 it\u2019s traumatising. My first instinct was, \u2018What do we do if it starts collapsing? How do we get out?\u2019 And then it stopped and, of course, everyone is okay. But it weighs on your mind. I keep thinking: what if the next one is bigger? What if it doesn\u2019t stop so quickly?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The biggest of these \u2013 that which jolted Ms Cox in bed \u2013 was a 2.9 shaker on bank holiday Monday, felt from Blackpool to Preston. Pictures posted online showed garden walls toppled and cracks in ceiling plaster. It was followed just 14 hours later by a 1.0 tremor.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They are almost certainly manmade. The earth shaking has coincided exactly with the recommencing of drilling nearby at the UK\u2019s only active fracking site.\n\n\u201cThey are making us live in an earthquake zone,\u201d says Ms Cox, a long-term campaigner against fracking there. \u201cMaking people live with this constant danger is unforgivable.\u201d\n\nWork at the hugely controversial shale gas site \u2013 just off Preston New Road near Little Plumpton village \u2013 has now been indefinitely suspended while the Oil and Gas Authority investigates the seismic activity.\n\nBut residents are demanding more than a mere a moratorium.\n\nOn Tuesday, they delivered an open letter to Cuadrilla \u2013 the company that runs the site \u2013 demanding it is now mothballed for good. On Wednesday, as rain poured, more than 40 people picketed the site itself. Many dressed themselves in white as a sign of peaceful protest.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t come out in weather like this unless you are being pushed beyond your limits,\u201d noted 63-year-old Barbara Richardson, a campaigner with Frack Free Lancashire, from under a sodden umbrella. \u201cBut what\u2019s being done to us \u2013 and to the future generations who will have to live with the consequence \u2013 isn\u2019t right. We have to fight it. We have no other option.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Among their numbers have been Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace activists but most of those who turn up, week in, week out, are simply residents concerned by both the earthquakes and environmental damage, including high-level emissions and toxic waste. Because many are women of a certain vintage, they have nicknamed themselves the Lancashire Nanas and \u2013 as a symbol of this \u2013 quite often don tabards.\n\n\u201cBecause nanas get things done,\u201d Tina Rothery, the group\u2019s de facto spokeswoman previously told The Independent. \u201cAnd, believe me, we will get this done. We will get fracking stopped.\u201d\n\nIndeed, these recent tremors may, in the long-run, help with this goal. A smaller quake measuring 2.3 on the Richter scale led to the UK\u2019s only other fracking site being shut down permanently in Blackpool in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s now time for the same thing to happen here,\u201d says Tina, a 57-year-old grandmother-of-one. \u201cIsn\u2019t it common sense that you don\u2019t start earthquakes in places where people live?\u201d\n\nDrilling at the Preston New Road site itself started just last year. It did so only after initial proposals to frack the area were rejected by Lancashire County Council \u2013 but then approved on appeal by the government.\n\nAn initial exploratory drilling period between October and December 2018 led to more than 50 incidents of seismic activity being recorded by the British Geological Survey. After an eight-month pause since then, drilling started on a second well on 15 August. The first seismic activity came within hours.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was scared [when the house shook],\u201d says Julia Stribling, a 70-year-old retired pharmaceutical dispenser who lives just off the Preston New Road. \u201cI\u2019m a Lancashire woman. Being scared isn\u2019t in my nature. But it\u2019s unsettling. My husband was looking at me wondering what was happening. I was looking at our family antiques in the cabinet. If they got smashed, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. They don\u2019t have much value but they\u2019re priceless to me \u2026 It\u2019s things like that that Cuadrilla don\u2019t care about. They wouldn\u2019t compensate me for smashing my mum\u2019s heirlooms.\u201d\n\nThe company itself did not respond to The Independent\u2019s request for comment but, in an earlier statement, said it appreciated the tremor had \u201ccaused concern\u201d for people.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting,\u201d it said in a statement on the 2.9 shaker, \u201cthat this event lasted for around a second and the average ground motion recorded was 5mm per second. This is about a third of that permitted for construction projects.\u201d\n\nLonger-term, it says, fracking can meet huge swathes of the UK\u2019s energy needs and is environmentally cleaner than traditional fossil fuels, if not renewable sources.\n\nThe Oil and Gas Authority, meanwhile, said that \u201coperations at the site will remain suspended for as long as it takes for our scientists to examine the data from what happened over the weekend \u2013 there\u2019s no fixed timeframe\u201d.\n\nYet such assurances, here among the campaigners, seem unlikely to appease.\n\nThey say that fracking should not only be ended in Lancashire but outlawed across the country to prevent future sites ever being set up \u2013 a policy which would only put England in line with Germany, France, Scotland and Wales.\n\n\u201cA temporary shutdown isn\u2019t good enough anymore,\u201d says Ms Cox again. \u201cOne of these days one of these quakes is going to cause things to fall down and put lives in danger. Does someone really need to die before, as a country, we finally say we can\u2019t allow this any longer?\u201d", "description": "Miranda Cox was enjoying a morning cup of tea in bed at her home in Kirkham,\u00a0Lancashire, when the earthquake struck.
