(If you\u2019re not interested in paying Apple eight bones every month to access its games, make sure you cancel your automatic renewal in Subscriptions so that you won\u2019t be charged when your trial ends.)\n\nAfter activating, you\u2019ll have access to dozens of brand new games, including a new version of Frogger, LEGO Brawls, Skate City, Sayonara Wild Hearts, and more. Arcade \u2014 which Gizmodo Senior Reviews Editor Alex Cranz says is pretty damn great and probably worth its $7.99 monthly price tag \u2014 will be ad-free and available for offline play on iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs, or Macs.\n\nApple didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment about the early rollout.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t running a beta version of the latest iOS, don\u2019t stress. Arcade will officially launch in the App Store on September 20. You\u2019ll likely have to do an update to see it, but we won\u2019t know for sure until Thursday.", "description": "If you\u2019re an iOS 13 beta user who\u2019s been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Arcade, it looks like you may be able to pop the hood on Apple\u2019s subscription gaming service a full three days ahead of its official launch date....", "authors": ["Victoria Song", "Germain Lussier"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/lq4abphacipsb0brt6ir.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
