Photo: Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n\nDays after Donald Trump embarrassed his former national security adviser, John Bolton by firing him on Twitter, a new report suggests that the president is zeroing in on an unconventional replacement for the foreign policy hawk: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nCNN reported Thursday that Trump may ask Pompeo to pull double duty, serving as both national security adviser and the head of the State Department. It would be quite an elevation for Pompeo, who was Bolton\u2019s main rival in the Trump White House and quite clearly happy to see him fired this week. While Bolton and Pompeo didn\u2019t diverge much along ideological lines, they were reportedly quite different in temperament. Bolton is combative and known for knocking down ideas and Pompeo is better at playing to Trump\u2019s whims.\n\nFor now, Trump has elevated Charles Kupperman, Bolton\u2019s former deputy, to temporarily fill in as national security adviser. He said Wednesday he has five \u201cvery highly qualified\u201d people who want the job. Reportedly among the top contenders are Trump\u2019s special representatives to North Korea and Iran, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, and a retired army colonel who went on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show hours after Bolton was fired to audition for the job.\n\nIf Trump decides to tap Pompeo, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019s given a trusted aide extra responsibilities. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is also director of the Office of Management and Budget and previously served as Trump\u2019s head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has a portfolio overflowing with responsibilities.\n\nThe same person serving as both national security adviser and secretary of State would not be unprecedented either. In 1973, Richard Nixon tapped his then-national security adviser Henry Kissinger to serve as secretary of State. Kissinger served in both roles simultaneously for two years.", "description": "If Mike Pompeo replaces John Bolton, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time one man served as secretary of State and national security adviser simultaneously.
