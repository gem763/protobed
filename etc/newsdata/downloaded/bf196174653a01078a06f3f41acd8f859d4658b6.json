During the Q & A following a screening of \u201cBlindspotting\u201d \u2014 a movie that engages with police brutality against black people, systemic racial inequalities and gentrification \u2014 an older white woman in the audience asked the director if he was \u201cafraid\u201d while they while they were filming on location in Oakland, Calif. Instantly and jarringly, I was reminded of my other-ness within the room.\n\nAt a press screening of Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d several years ago, I sat through the dramatized depiction of the life of the slave Solomon Northup, in all of its austere, made-for-the-Oscars glory. After sitting through the subjugation of several black characters, especially Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Patsy, who is raped onscreen by her master and later suffers an excruciatingly unflinching whipping, I was emotionally drained by the weight of the horrors that had been depicted onscreen.\n\nAs the mostly white audience trickled out of the theater at the end, I overheard a man expressing relief to his companion: \u201cI couldn\u2019t last 12 minutes of all that, never mind 12 years!\u201d\n\nDuring the Black Out performance of \u201cSlave Play,\u201d I was shielded from having to endure such gross remarks for a couple of hours. Sure, it was awkward to see Kaneisha twerk to a Rihanna song in Mammy-ish garb for her white husband, who was dressed as a plantation overseer. Watching the researchers conducting the retreat (an interracial lesbian couple) lead the black participants in unpacking their resentment, anger and irritation toward their white partners was discomforting. (It also resurfaced many emotions based on my own past experiences with white romantic partners.) And it was difficult to sit with the play\u2019s final moments, which involve a sexually violent and emotional catharsis.\n\nBut that night there seemed to be a fellowship among everyone, as people collectively gasped, provided audible ad-libs (\u201cShe\u2019s crazy!\u201d someone exclaimed, referring to the extremely oblivious and frequent interrupter Alana) and erupted into laughter or applause at some of the more outlandish or scabrous moments. If we all interpreted and felt about it differently, it still meant something to have the relief of freedom from judgment to express those responses.\n\nThere were fewer of us the second time I saw \u201cSave Play,\u201d during one of the final preview showings last week. The audience was mostly white, and, unsurprisingly, that sense of community didn\u2019t have quite the same power as it did during the Black Out. The audience was much more muted, though some of the show\u2019s most pivotal moments and biggest comedic beats garnered similarly audible reactions.\n\nIt probably helped that I already knew what I was in for, but the experience wasn\u2019t as uncomfortable as I thought it might be. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that Harris\u2019s script is clear in its intentions: The entire point of the therapy, and the reason the black characters desire to role-play antebellum fantasies, is because they want their partners to acknowledge their whiteness and the role racism plays in their every day lives.", "description": "Experiencing Jeremy O.
