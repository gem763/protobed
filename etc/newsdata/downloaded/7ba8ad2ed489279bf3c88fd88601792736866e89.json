(Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nA note to add to Michael Brendan Dougherty\u2019s excellent column on the home page, arguing that \u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric about ending stupid and wasteful wars in the Middle East is not matched by the reality of policy.\u201d In fact, it is fair to argue that Trump\u2019s rhetoric about U.S. forces in the Middle East is not matched by reality, period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThursday on the White House lawn, Trump told reporters, \u201cwe have no soldiers in Syria. We\u2019ve won. We\u2019ve beat ISIS. And we\u2019ve beat them badly and decisively. We have no soldiers.\u201d\n\nJust today, the Department of Defense put out a statement about secretary of defense Mark Esper and Turkish Minister of National Defense Hulusi Akar speaking by phone Thursday, where Esper, \u201creiterated his strong concern that, despite U.S. force protection measures, Turkey\u2019s actions could harm U.S. personnel in Syria.\u201d\n\nTuesday, chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman, declared, \u201cwe have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety. We have made no changes to our force presence in Syria at this time.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. special forces member who spoke to Fox News\u2019 Jennifer Griffin is characterized as one of \u201cthe 1,000 or so U.S. troops who remain in Syria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither the president is not being honest about the presence of U.S. soldiers in Syria, he\u2019s blurring the line between his desired goal and current conditions, or he is . . . unaware of where our troops are.
