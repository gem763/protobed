Even at his most switched on, he tends to come across as tetchy and distracted. However, that said, his press tour for Joker doesn\u2019t exactly seem to be helping the matter. Early on, he walked out of an interview with the Telegraph after not unreasonably being asked if he was worried that the film would inspire copycat crimes.\n\nWhy so stupid: how Joker is too juvenile to be provocative Read more\n\nAnd then this week, on Jimmy Kimmel Live, he gave a truly baffling interview. It was full of all the same rambling half-answers as usual, but was also shot through with some half-joking aggression. At one point Kimmel teased Phoenix about his old breakdancing, to which he testily replied: \u201cYou\u2019re making fun of it, but it was pretty serious to me\u201d. And then came an \u201cexclusive outtake\u201d from Joker, where Phoenix railed Christian Bale-style at an offscreen crew member. Phoenix claimed to be surprised by the clip, and apologised for his terrible behaviour. It was, all in all, very odd.\n\nPhoenix\u2019s publicist has since said that the clip \u2013 and the ambush, and the response \u2013 were all planned in advance, and that this was yet another I\u2019m Still Here-style fakeout on Phoenix\u2019s part. But nevertheless, it goes to show how much more interesting these sorts of interviews can be when the thick smear of Hollywood grease gets rubbed off. To commemorate Phoenix\u2019s awkwardness, here are some other wonderfully derailed press tours from days gone by.\n\nJeremy Renner, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\n\nBy 2013, Jeremy Renner had gained a reputation as the Next Big Thing thanks to his turn in The Hurt Locker and his roles in the Mission: Impossible and Avengers films. But then came Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, a bad film that Renner had to promote knowing how bad it was. Vulture has compiled an exhaustive list of his most sullen interviews from the tour \u2013 the sarcastic \u201cwooo\u201d after a clip is shown on Fallon is a highlight \u2013 but look at the video above. Look how much he hates being there. Look at the effort it takes him to say anything positive at all. Look at Gemma Arterton\u2019s body language. I know someone who interviewed Renner on this tour. \u201cAngriest man I ever met\u201d was his takeaway recollection.\n\nMatt Damon, Downsizing\n\nA press tour that took place in the wake of #MeToo, and went so badly that he had to skip his own premiere. What went wrong for Matt Damon? Was it that he defended men who patted women on the bottom, because they weren\u2019t also rapists? Or when he said that more recognition should be given to men \u201cwho don\u2019t do this kind of thing\u201d? Either way, it was the worst Matt Damon press tour since the one where he whitesplained diversity to a black woman.\n\nDakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, 50 Shades of Grey\n\nAdmittedly the excruciating interview format did a lot of the work here \u2013 you try maintaining your good humour while chirpy strangers yell at you from an iPad \u2013 but Glamour\u2019s interview with the stars of 50 Shades of Grey was nevertheless an unscalable wall of awkwardness. There\u2019s little eye contact between Johnson and Dornan, and chilly silences, and overblown exhalations of boredom. It looked, to all intents and purposes, like the pair absolutely hated each other; a sensation backed up by monosyllabic TV interviews and photo after photo after photo in a Jezebel post entitled Double Crap: Fifty Shades of Grey Stars Can\u2019t Fucking Stand Each Other.\n\nJesse Eisenberg, Now You See Me\n\nEisenberg\u2019s reputation for playing aloof, better-than-you entitled pricks more convincingly than anyone else may well have its roots here. In the space of two minutes and 43 seconds, Eisenberg repeatedly manages to belittle his interviewer to the point where he eventually tells her \u201cDon\u2019t cry now; cry after the interview\u2019s over\u201d. It went down so badly that, in a later interview, he asked the interviewer to \u201cspread the word that I\u2019m not an asshole\u201d. Even when Now You See Me 2 was released, the reputation lingered; in one interview he asked whether or not he came across as an \u201cindulgent prick\u201d.\n\nSamuel L Jackson, RoboCop\n\nSometimes, just sometimes, an awkward interview isn\u2019t down to the star. It\u2019s down to an interviewer accidentally thinking that he\u2019s interviewing a different black person than the one he\u2019s actually interviewing. All that anyone remembers about the 2014 RoboCop remake is the interview where local news anchor Sam Rubin asked Samuel L Jackson if he enjoyed his recent Super Bowl commercial. Except Samuel L Jackson hadn\u2019t starred in a Super Bowl commercial; Laurence Fishburne had. \u201cWe don\u2019t all look alike,\u201d Jackson shouted, before refusing to let Rubin off the hook for four agonising minutes.", "description": "A string of uncomfortable interviews with Joaquin Phoenix for Joker join a well of other awkward run-ins between actors and journalists", "authors": ["Stuart Heritage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e9708e043858efeb96b79981a206fb1b8d9d638/249_812_1432_859/master/1432.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=280319efb4faddd891301679929f343a"}
