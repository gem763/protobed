(AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nBasketball players have long worked hard to maneuver, contort and control their bodies to avoid contact.\n\nApparently, being aware of the movement of referees\u2019 bodies just got added to the list of responsibilities.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nChicago Sky center Astou Ndour got hit with the mother of all bad calls on Sunday during a season-closing game against the Washington Mystics. It started with Ndour standing still as her teammate lobbied a walking ref and ended with her ejection.\n\nGet ready, you\u2019re about to see one of the most comically bad calls of your life.\n\nHere's the video replay of the Astou Ndour ejection: pic.twitter.com/MipIgQdfSM \u2014 Nick Niendorf (@niendorf21) September 8, 2019\n\nThe muted outrage of the referee\u2019s face as he immediately assumes what happened, his emphatic signal to eject Ndour, Ndour\u2019s teammate\u2019s stunned reaction, it\u2019s all just too perfect. As is the simple picture of a man walking into a stationary woman while looking the other way and concluding she was the one at fault.\n\nThe Sky sure could have used Ndour for the rest of the game, as the team eventually lost 100-86 to the league best Mystics. The Sky will finish the season at 20-14, the league\u2019s fifth-best records.\n\nWe\u2019ll see if they run into any obstacles in the playoffs. Or, rather, have any obstacles run into them.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Chicago Sky's Astou Ndour got hit with the mother of all bad calls on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QjGQwqXrJ3okeSBE_di3IQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7syE2n5x2t8jPIUVWoZMEw--~B/aD0yODU4O3c9NTA4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/9a5fcb00-d295-11e9-bfbf-d5a0a0cb0945", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
