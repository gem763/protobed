(AP) - Talented and deep, mature and hungry, No. 7 Maryland brings the potential for greatness into coach Mark Turgeon\u2019s ninth year at the school.\n\nThe leading scorer from last season, senior guard Anthony Cowan Jr., will be accompanied by forward Jalen Smith, who has added some bulk to his lean frame following a strong freshman season. Starters Eric Ayala and Darryl Morsell are also back, to be joined by a skilled freshman class that includes 6-foot-10 twins Makhi and Makhel Mitchell.\n\nCenter Bruno Fernando left for the NBA, but the Terrapins are nevertheless poised to improve upon a 2018-19 season in which they went 23-11 and came within a 3-pointer from advancing to the Sweet 16.\n\nNo one\u2019s openly talking about adding a national championship to the one coach Gary Williams claimed in 2002, but the possibility is there.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re coachable and they\u2019re selfless,\u201d Turgeon said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll get continue to get better and we\u2019ll do some great things.\u201d\n\nSeven of the eight players from last season\u2019s rotation are back, and Turgeon likes what he\u2019s seen from the five freshmen on the roster.\n\n\u201cI would probably say it\u2019s my deepest team,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will be times in games this year where we sub and we get better. And that\u2019s not always hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know heading to Maryland\u2019s 2019-20 season:\n\nSENIOR POWER\n\nCowan entered his name in the NBA draft but withdrew to return for one more campaign with the Terps.\n\n\u201cI want to win. That\u2019s been my main goal this whole time,\u201d said Cowan, who was voted second-team All-Big Ten last season after averaging 15.6 points per game and leading Maryland in assists.\n\n\u201cIn a world where it\u2019s not great to become a senior, I am really proud of Anthony,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cMaybe he can make it cool again to do it.\u201d\n\nSTIX AND LOGS\n\nAs a freshman, the rail-thin Smith was nicknamed \u201cStix.\u201d\n\nAfter working long hours in the weight room during the offseason, the 6-10 sophomore has earned the moniker \u201cLogs\u201d from Turgeon.\n\nSmith was sensational in the NCAA Tournament, getting 19 points and 12 rebounds in a 79-77 win over Belmont before tallying 15 points, eight rebounds and five blocks in a heartbreaking 69-67 loss to Louisiana State.\n\n\u201cLast year pretty much just motivated me to get stronger and work on my weaknesses,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI was 215 pounds last year and now I\u2019m 225-227. It\u2019s going to help me withstand hits and have a longer endurance.\u201d\n\nBIG MEN\n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard to replace Fernando\u2019s unrelenting enthusiasm, but the physical presence he provided in the lane could very well be handled by a trio of freshmen.\n\nIn addition to the Mitchell twins, 7-2 Chol Marial of South Sudan should end up altering many an inside shot. Marial will get a late start after having surgery to repair stress fractures in both legs, but the Mitchells can contribute immediately.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dominant bigs,\u201d Makhi said. \u201cI can step out and dribble it a little bit. Makhel can shoot a 15-footer, shoot a 3. Defensive-wise, we both block shots, great rebounders.\u201d\n\nThe brothers both went to Wilson High in the nation\u2019s capital and made a pact to stay together in college.\n\n\u201cIt was a package deal,\u201d Makhi said.\n\nHIGH HOPE\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Turgeon has entered a season surrounded by lofty expectations. In 2015, a team with Diamond Stone, Jake Layman and Melo Trimble started 15-1 and reached the AP Top 10 but lost in the semifinals of the conference tournament and was blown out by Kansas in the third round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nMaryland fans are looking for greatness this season, too, but Turgeon and the players have no intention of getting swept up by the hype.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re embracing the expectations much better than that team did. That was kind of new for us,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared for it.\u201d\n\nFINISHING TOUCH\n\nBefore opening Big Ten play, Maryland faces a fairly soft schedule with the possible exception of Notre Dame at home in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge.\n\nThe Terrapins hope to be playing their best basketball toward the end of the regular season, because the final five games include trips to Ohio State and Minnesota, along with home matchups with Michigan and Michigan State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Talented and deep, mature and hungry, No. 7 Maryland brings the potential for greatness into coach Mark Turgeon's ninth year at the school.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/maryland_preview_22114_c0-112-2700-1687_s1200x700.jpg?cbd9ae3fb211e20fbf966eba0d7a69dcc9f74cdd", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
