(Getty)\n\nWhen you\u2019re 6-foot-8 and play for a city\u2019s professional basketball organization, it\u2019s tough to remain incognito. When you wear a division rival\u2019s jersey into the midst of a hometown tailgate, trouble can ensue.

We will have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll update as we get more information.\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
