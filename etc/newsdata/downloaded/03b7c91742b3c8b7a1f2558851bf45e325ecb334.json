Was he on the same call that I was? Can't be possible!\"\n\nRepublicans mobilized to undercut Vindman's credibility, questioning his loyalty by noting he immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union at the age of three, and suggesting he is part of an effort by the US national security bureaucracy to undermine Trump.\n\n\"Donald Trump is innocent. The deep state is guilty,\" said Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz, one of the president's most strident defenders in Congress.\n\nFirst White House witness\n\nAppearing against White House orders to not comply with a congressional subpoena, Vindman is the first witness to have personally listened in on the July 25 phone call at the core of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRepublicans have argued that nine previous witnesses only knew of the call's contents second-hand, although a heavily edited official \"transcript\" of the call appears to match testimony that Trump pressured Zelensky for political reasons.\n\nVindman says in the prepared testimony that a senior US diplomat close to Trump, ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, was the first person he witnessed pressing Ukraine for the investigations, in a July 10 meeting with Ukraine national security official Oleksandr Danylyuk.\n\n\"Following this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Ambassador Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,\" he says, referring to a Ukraine energy company on whose board Biden's son Hunter sat while his father was vice president.\n\n\"I stated to Ambassador Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security,\" he says.\n\nHe says the same of the Trump-Zelensky call.\n\n\"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government's support of Ukraine,\" he says.\n\n\"I realised that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play,\" he says.\n\nVindman reported both his concerns about the July 10 meeting and the July 25 call to the chief attorney of the NSC.\n\nDemocrats push impeachment forward\n\nWhile Trump continued to insist the call was \"perfect,\" Democrats made plans to step up the impeachment effort with a House vote formalising procedures Thursday.\n\n\"Everybody has read your words on the call,\" Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a tweet directed at Trump Tuesday.\n\n\"The Ukrainian President asks for military aid to fend off the Russian attack, you say 'I want you to do us a favor though,' and then you spend the rest of the call asking for bogus investigations to smear your political opponents.\"", "description": "A new witness in the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump rocked the White House Tuesday with testimony that he personally witnessed officials pressuring Ukraine to help Trump politically.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9514/8a7c7bd58fe44bb98ef88857a12d326f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
