Most days are spent struggling to keep your own life under control.\n\nJust the idea of having an influence in decision-making, beyond A-level choices, is something we rarely get to experience.\n\nBut, occasionally \u2013 like when you and fellow teenagers go on strike and protest climate change and in turn irritate the prime minister into calling people like you a \u2018uncooperative crustie\u2019 \u2013 you realise the power in your own words and actions.\n\nWhen Boris Johnson referred to the thousands of climate activists blockading London as \u2018uncooperative crusties\u2019 this week he gave fuel to a fire burning in all of us.\n\nThat statement was not the words of someone who feels indifferent \u2014 that was the immature aggression of someone who feels threatened, someone who realises they are losing a battle. Because politicians do not issue angry statements unless they are afraid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe climate justice movement is just made up of people, who might have absolutely nothing in common except one shared goal: a livable planet and a better future.\n\nThe unity you see on the streets is far greater than what you see in Parliament. The uncooperative behaviour that so many politicians have been quick to condemn is global cooperation on an enormous scale.\n\nThe uncertainty we face cannot, and will not, be solved by \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 childish bullying\n\nIt is thousands of people working together to fight for the survival of our planet and all the life that depends on it. The community that has been built on the streets of London could not exist without cooperation \u2014 generalisations and stereotypes from our politicians do not change the fact that the climate justice movement is diverse, it is powerful and it is united.\n\nFor every \u2018traditional\u2019 environmentalist on the streets right now there is a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, a parent with their child standing alongside them.\n\nThe uncertainty we face cannot and will not be solved by childish bullying (Picture: REUTERS/Henry Nicholls)\n\nSolidarity is lacking in the political dialogue that dominates our conversations, our media and our lives. People are angry and afraid, and rightfully so. We live in a time of uncertainty. But the uncertainty we face cannot and will not be solved by \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014childish bullying.\n\nI don\u2019t take particular offence to what he said. He has used language far worse to many other groups and individuals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there is actually some truth in his words: I refuse to be complacent in a system that is destroying my future. I refuse to stop fighting.\n\nSo condemn us all you want. Just remember, insults and stereotypes are nothing more than a waste of time \u2014 time we cannot afford to lose.\n\nTime we don\u2019t have. Time that is costing people their lives.\n\nThis is a reminder to our government: We would not be here if you had done your jobs. If you hadn\u2019t continued in your oblivious support for fracking and airport expansion. If you were on track to meet emissions goals, if your priorities were in the right place, then the streets of London would not be the home of a rebellion.\n\nIt is your inaction that has led us here and we are facing a crisis. We are facing an emergency of enormous scale and we need to see more than words, supportive or otherwise, from our government.\n\nWe need to see action.\n\nMORE: London City Airport faces closure as Extinction Rebellion plan day of chaos\n\nMORE: Which Westminster roads have been closed by Extinction Rebellion protesters\n\nMORE: In pictures: \u2018Biggest ever\u2019 climate change protests in London and around the world", "description": "The uncertainty we face cannot, and will not, be solved by \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 childish bullying.", "authors": ["Izzy Warren", "Volunteer", "Social Media Coordinator", "Uk Student Climate Network"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175920047_1570694208.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
