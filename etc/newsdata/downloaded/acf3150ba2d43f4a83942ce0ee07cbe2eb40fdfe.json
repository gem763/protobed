Like, does he unwind after a hard day at the office by pouring himself a drink and dabbing on a little greasepaint? It seems plausible at this point that Trudeau has spent more of his life in blackface than out of it\n\nOr maybe Alex Griswold is right: \u201cHave we considered that Trudeau might just be a black guy frequently wearing whiteface?\u201d\n\nA fun subplot to all of this also flagged by Griswold is the reluctance of some parts of the media to use the term \u201cblackface\u201d to describe what he did. Whatever this handsome young beacon of progress is guilty of \u2014 \u201cdark make-up,\u201d \u201cface darkener,\u201d \u201ccosmetics of a conspicuously dusky hue\u201d \u2014 it can\u2019t be described as \u201cblackface.\u201d Blackface is what insensitive right-wing racists do.\n\nJustin Trudeau accused of using makeup, on his face, in a way that made his face look darker, almost black even pic.twitter.com/u1r5i7NNlw \u2014 Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) September 19, 2019\n\nWatching them try to accuse one of their favorite politicians of \u201cblackface\u201d feels like watching Fonzie try to say \u201csorry.\u201d It\u2019s so glaring that Trudeau himself called them out on it at his press conference this afternoon:\n\n\u201cI appreciate you calling it makeup, but it was blackface.\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he \u201cshared the moments that he recollected\u201d of his use of blackface, after three images of him surfaced in the past day pic.twitter.com/yF6SP5uplT \u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) September 19, 2019\n\nWhat keeps getting me is that he made the blackface as garish as possible. He didn\u2019t go for C. Thomas Howell \u201cSoul Man\u201d skin tones or a plausible-ish Robert Downey Jr \u201cTropic Thunder\u201d look. He went full shoe polish. And he didn\u2019t forget his hands and arms, notes Stephen \u201credsteeze\u201d Miller.\n\nWas this full-body coverage, all the way down to and including \u201clittle Justin\u201d? He was *really* owning this look.\n\nAnd he was doing it, I remind you, at the age of 29, as the son and heir to a Canadian prime minister of world renown. Someone needs to ask him at what age, precisely, and under what circumstances he finally grew aware that blackface is offensive. Did it dawn on him when he hit 40?\n\nHe\u2019s doing his best to be contrite, as you\u2019ll see in the final clip below. But if I were him, I\u2019d embrace a full woke defense: \u201cI don\u2019t do it to mock oppressed peoples, I do it to share their burden. In fact, I\u2019m going to put some on right now.\u201d Call it wokeface, not blackface. The full Dolezal. Alas, he\u2019s chosen to grovel instead.", "description": "\"I am wary of being definitive.\"", "authors": ["Hot Air Staff", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
