To get from The Rock to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson would take a real attitude adjustment.\n\nJohnson was still tethered to his WWF contract and his wrestling persona when he made his first proper Hollywood film in 2001. In The Mummy Returns, he played the thankless, shirtless role of the Scorpion King, an ancient warrior who sold his soul to the god Anubis only to return centuries later as a monster-man with spider legs and a bad CG facelift.\n\n\u201cThe Scorpion King and The Rock are both conquerers,\u201d The Rock said at the time, referring to himself in the third person while promoting the film. \u201cThe role was tailor-made for me.\u201d\n\nLuckily, the movie made money. (It also earned The Rock his first mainstream kudos\u2014the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Sleazebag, proof of how far he\u2019s come.) Its spin-off, The Scorpion King, was the payoff for The Rock; his first starring vehicle scored $160 million worldwide and gave him a foundation for a legit career in film.\n\nHe left the sword and loincloth behind and followed The Scorpion King with two grounded buddy actioners: 2003\u2019s The Rundown opposite Seann William Scott, which critics embraced, and 2004\u2019s Walking Tall with Johnny Knoxville, which they did not. In fact, as Johnson forged his path into the action game testing the waters in projects across multiple genres, few of them were winners. (Looking at you, Doom.)\n\nHe took chances and diversified with a surprising comedic turn as a gay bodyguard/aspiring actor in Be Cool, a cameo in Reno 911! The Movie, and a major role in Richard Kelly\u2019s ambitious sci-fi satire Southland Tales.\n\nAnd in this time, The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment became The Most Electrifying Man In All of Entertainment by shrewdly trading in his crowd-pleasing brand of brow-raising brio for a relatable strain of All-American humility.\n\nThat transformation started as The Rock went Disney as a footballer with a daughter he never knew he had in The Game Plan, his first family flick and his last credited picture as \u201cThe Rock.\u201d The movie made $147 million worldwide, making it the most successful Johnson-fronted film to not feature violent action at the time.\n\nThen came Get Smart, Race to Witch Mountain, and Tooth Fairy as Johnson followed in the tradition of Mr. Nanny-era Hulk Hogan and Diesel in The Pacifier with a dose of friendly neighborhood brawn for the whole family. A scene-stealing blip of an appearance in 2010\u2019s The Other Guys was a stroke of perfect casting: Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson as the NYPD\u2019s hotshot star cops.\n\nMeanwhile, he made sure to keep one bicep in the action game, starring in 2010\u2019s modest B-movie revenge thriller Faster. But his action cred skyrocketed when he joined the Fast & Furious franchise as U.S. agent Luke Hobbs, whose dogged international hunt for Dominic Toretto and his crew led to the most evenly matched and homoerotically charged mano a mano fight scene of the series.\n\nJohnson\u2019s cache as a marquee star was on the rise, too; he opened the adventure sequel Journey 2: The Mysterious Island to bigger global returns than its predecessor. Topping out at $335 million box office, the family sequel is still his best performing non-ensemble starring vehicle to date.\n\nHis four-movie 2013 ran the action gamut: Crime drama Snitch came and went, but Johnson notched another commercial win as Roadblock in G.I. Joe: Retaliation and co-starred in Michael Bay\u2019s violent black comedy Pain and Gain. And after reprising his Hobbs role in Furious 6\u2014this time as part of the Toretto family, sealing his place as a franchise staple\u2014he transcended a generic script and hot competition from Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Lucy to eke out a modest second-place showing at the weekend box office for Brett Ratner\u2019s Hercules, a sword-and-sandals hero\u2019s slice \u2019em-up that, in the very least, could claim that it boasted a starring turn by Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.\n\nLike Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, Johnson\u2019s displayed a social media savvy that\u2019s only enhanced his brand as America\u2019s brawniest sweetheart. Unlike Diesel, he\u2019s mostly avoided falling down rabbit holes of ill-advised passion projects along the way. (Coincidentally or not, Johnson\u2019s only enemy in San Andreas besides California\u2019s fickle fault lines is a character named Riddick.)\n\nIn the last few years he decided to carve a new career path. He switched agencies because his CAA reps were too \u201ccynical\u201d about how he should conform to leading man conventions, he told The New York Times, and didn\u2019t support his desire to return to the wrestling ring. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a blueprint of the half-black, half-Samoan former football player-wrestler, who then made his way to Hollywood,\u201d Johnson told Variety. \u201cI was willing to take the risk and then I became myself\u2014it sounds funny to say that.\u201d He also started his own production company. HBO\u2019s June sports drama Ballers, which Johnson stars in and executive-produces, debuts on June 21.\n\nBut first: In the new earthquake flick, Johnson plays an L.A. Fire Department helicopter-piloting hero who drops everything to save his daughter and estranged wife when the Big One rips its way up from Los Angeles to San Francisco. He doesn\u2019t throw a single punch, even if he\u2019s driven by the same primal paternal instinct that sent Liam Neeson after his daughter\u2019s kidnappers in Taken, putting that particular set of skills to good use.\n\nSure, the script is packed with groan-inducing, corny dialogue and a plot with more zany cracks than the poor, quake-ravaged streets of San Francisco.\n\nAnd maybe Johnson\u2019s hero shirks his duties as an emergency first responder to save his family as hundreds of thousands of faceless strangers perish to death in the rubble.\n\nHe\u2019s The Rock; he can be forgiven for a great many slights, including dereliction of duty. We want to see him win. It\u2019s the American way. And despite scathing early reviews, with no other big-name megastars to shoulder the messy San Andreas alongside him, it\u2019s Johnson\u2019s off-screen star power that will make many root for him this weekend. Because no matter what movie he finds himself in, he\u2019s become a new kind of People\u2019s Champion.", "description": "Here\u2019s how The Rock pummeled his way from pro wrestler and \u201cChoice Movie Sleazebag\u201d to the biggest action movie star in the world.", "authors": ["Jen Yamato"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492181024/articles/2015/05/28/the-rock-the-action-hero-america-deserves-and-the-one-it-needs-right-now/150427-yamato-rock-tease_ad9dgq", "published_at": "2015-05-28"}
