Through the first three games, the trio was starting to build chemistry. So, when Reirden decided to break the group up when Washington played Dallas for the first time this season Tuesday, a 4-3 overtime loss, there were some lingering doubts.\n\nAfter two games with Stephenson in the lineup over Dowd, that fourth-line combo is back. Through five games, Hathaway has one goal and one assist, while Leipsic has one assist. The trio looked like the best line on the ice in the later stages of the Capitals\u2019 2-1 win over the New York Islanders on Oct. 4 and had another solid showing in a 3-2 overtime loss to Carolina in the Capitals\u2019 home opener the next day.\n\nAD\n\nThe Capitals\u2019 other forward lines against the Stars remained the same. Ilya Samsonov will get his second start in net; his first came in the win over the Islanders. Samsonov, 22, finished with 25 saves in his NHL debut, while Braden Holtby has a 1-1-2 record.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLooking forward to seeing him in his second start. He was solid in the first one and hope we can do a better job of insulating him than we have Braden lately,\u201d Reirden said of Samsonov. \u201cSo that will be important against a very offensive group with the Dallas Stars, especially here at home.\u201d\n\nOn the blue line, the Capitals will still be without Kempny. Counting the contest against Dallas, Kempny will have missed six regular season games. Before the team\u2019s trip to Nashville, Kempny said he was progressing well and felt good on the ice but needed more practice time. After Saturday night, the Capitals will return to Washington to practice Sunday ahead of Monday\u2019s game against the Colorado Avalanche. That practice should provide more information about Kempny\u2019s availability against Colorado.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnxiously awaiting him to return,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cJust with the situation we have with the extra right-handed defensemen is not ideal, and it is the situation we are in right now and we will gladly have him back regardless of the situation, but especially this year.\u201d\n\nCapitals expected lines vs Stars:\n\n\n\nOvechkin-Backstrom-Wilson\n\nVrana-Kuznetsov-Oshie\n\nHagelin-Eller-Panik\n\nLeipsic-Dowd*-Hathaway\n\n\n\nSiegenthaler-Carlson\n\nOrlov-Jensen\n\nGudas-Lewington\n\n\n\nSamsonov\n\n\n\n*Dowd in as 4C over Stephenson \u2014 Samantha Pell (@SamanthaJPell) October 12, 2019\n\nRead more on the Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Samsonov will be making his second start for Washington this season.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/seHLIAq-kyUaQwsw_i-TL_eSKgc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HBLFNFG6IQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
