TBWA is part of Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nTBWA\\Media Arts Lab Chairman Emeritus Lee Clow tapped Mr. Milner as a lead creative on the firm\u2019s Apple business \u201cin or around\u201d 2000, according to the suit. Since then, Mr. Milner helped launch the iPod, iPhone, Apple TV and the iPad, working on high-profile ad campaigns such as \u201cMac vs. PC.\u201d\n\nThe complaint says Mr. Milner worked closely with Steve Jobs, the late chief executive of Apple, and helped grow the Apple account into one with more than $2 billion in billings a year. It is unclear how much Apple currently spends on the business. Billings typically refer to total ad and media spending, and agencies can, in some instances, get a percentage of that.\n\nTBWA in 2017 replaced Mr. Milner on the account with a younger employee, and moved Mr. Milner to MAL\\For Good, an agency formed by Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs\u2019s widow, the lawsuit says. There he managed far fewer employees and earned much less, according to the suit.\n\nMr. Milner became aware of \u201cthe ongoing narrative within the company of the need to hire \u2018digital natives,\u2019 i.e., younger people who were familiar with social media,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nAccording to the suit, Mr. Milner at one point told Kristen Clark, a chief talent officer for TBWA\\Media Arts Lab, \u201cIt\u2019s starting to look and smell like age discrimination.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Milner complained to TBWA CEO Troy Ruhanen about his compensation, Mr. Ruhanen cited the economics of the agency, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any agenda really beyond sort of just being treated fairly, and I just felt that wasn\u2019t the case and felt I didn\u2019t really have another alternative other than to file a suit,\u201d Mr. Milner said in an interview. \u201cI think [age discrimination] is something that is in the industry and isn\u2019t talked about that much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed in cases in the past few years that it\u2019s more and more rare for employees to reach retirement age in this industry,\u201d added Melissa Cardenas, an associate attorney at Shegerian & Associates, the law firm representing Mr. Milner.\n\nTBWA\\Media Arts Lab has been lauded for its work on the Apple account, but its relationship with the technology giant has also hit a few bumps over the years.\n\nAbout six years ago, Apple marketing leader Philip Schiller considered cutting ties with TBWA\\Media Arts Lab, according to emails revealed during a trial over an Apple and Samsung Group patent dispute. At the time, rival Samsung had been gaining traction with an ad campaign that made fun of buyers of Apple products.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "description": "The complaint, first reported by Adweek, alleges Mr. Milner\u2019s salary stagnated and his bonus declined after he spent years helping to build the highly profitable TBWA\\Media Arts Lab, an Apple-focused group within the larger agency network.", "authors": ["Alexandra Bruell", "Alexandra.Bruell Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104478/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
