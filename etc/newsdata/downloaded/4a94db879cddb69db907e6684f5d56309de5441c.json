Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday tweeted what she believed should be \u201cthe headline\u201d regarding John Bolton\u2019s departure from his role as White House national security adviser.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she captioned a screenshot of a chyron that read in part: \u201cTrump sides with Kim Jong Un.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously Bolton leaving is good \u2015 it was an enormous mistake to appoint him in the first place,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote in a second tweet about Bolton, who took a hawkish stance on foreign policy matters.\n\n\u201cOne doesn\u2019t need to boost authoritarians to make the point,\u201d she added.\n\nObviously Bolton leaving is good - it was an enormous mistake to appoint him in the first place. One doesn\u2019t need to boost authoritarians to make the point. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 11, 2019\n\nTrump on Wednesday appeared to side with the North Korean dictator when explaining the reasons for Bolton\u2019s exit. Trump and Bolton have disagreed on whether the latter was fired or resigned.\n\n\u201c[Bolton] made some very big mistakes when he talked about the Libyan model for Kim Jong Un. That was not a good statement to make,\u201d said the president. \u201cYou just take a look at what happened with [Muammar] Gaddafi. That was not a good statement to make. And it set us back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame Kim Jong Un for what he said after that,\u201d Trump added, in reference to insulting comments the North Korean regime later made about his adviser. \u201cAnd he wanted nothing to do with John Bolton. And that\u2019s not a question of being tough. That\u2019s a question of being not smart to say something like that.\u201d", "description": "\"That's it,\" the New York lawmaker captioned a chyron about President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7a015d230000580551b5de.jpeg?cache=q2txsitgnl&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
