Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Redskins made the announcement via Twitter, saying Gruden had been informed of the decision in an early morning meeting with owner Daniel Snyder and team president Bruce Allen.\n\nESPN reported Redskins assistant head coach/offensive line coach Bill Callahan will be the interim head coach.\n\nThe team scheduled a 1 p.m. ET press conference for Monday.\n\n\u201cThrough the first five games of the 2019 season, the team has clearly not performed up to expectations, and we all share in that responsibility,\u201d the team said in its release. \u201cMoving forward we are committed to doing all that we can collectively as an organization to turn things around and give our Redskins fans and alumni a team they can be proud of in 2019 and beyond.\u201d\n\nGruden was in his sixth season with the Redskins, compiling a 35-49-1 record that included Sunday\u2019s 33-7 home loss to the New England Patriots. Entering this season, he had won at least seven games in four straight years, including a 9-7 mark in 2015 that saw Washington reach the playoffs.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about his job status after Sunday\u2019s loss, Gruden said: \u201cNobody\u2019s told me anything. I don\u2019t have a concern. I\u2019ll just wait and see. If my key works on Monday, keep working, go attack the Miami Dolphins and plan on getting our first win next week.\u201d\n\nGruden signed a two-year contract extension in March of 2017, putting him under contract through the 2020 season. He lasted longer than any of Snyder\u2019s six previous head coaches, with none staying longer than four years.\n\nThe Redskins drafted quarterback Dwayne Haskins No. 15 overall in April and are expected to have a high pick in the 2020 NFL draft. They also have seven defensive starters who are 25 or younger.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Washington Redskins fired head coach Jay Gruden early Monday following the team's 0-5 start.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438069290&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960TM-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
