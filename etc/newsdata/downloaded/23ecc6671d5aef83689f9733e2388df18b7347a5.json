It has refused to respond to Seoul on other issues as well, like rice aid and the African Swine Fever outbreak.\"As the match won't be televised live, fans will likely have to check the score on the internet, but even that is unclear at this point.However, prior to kick-off, South Korea's national anthem will be played and South Korea's national flag will be raised as per the usual procedure at World Cup qualifiers.Oh Jung-hee, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
