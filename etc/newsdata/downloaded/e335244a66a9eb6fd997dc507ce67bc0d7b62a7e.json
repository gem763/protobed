Something is going to happen to a pregnant woman and a baby!'\n\nColeen's dramatic revelation enthralled Britain and sparked an angry denial from pregnant Rebekah, who said 'I don't need the money\u2019 and pointed out other people have had access to her Instagram account.\n\nThe wife of Jamie Vardy has now given an interview with The Daily Mail, in which she insisted arguing with Coleen is akin to rowing 'with a pigeon.'", "description": "The former glamour model, 35, put the WAG drama behind her as she enjoyed some quality time with her sons at\u00a0the Nickelodoen Slimefest at Blackpool Pleasure Beach on Saturday.", "authors": ["Niomi Harris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/13/19922796-0-image-a-80_1571489124273.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
