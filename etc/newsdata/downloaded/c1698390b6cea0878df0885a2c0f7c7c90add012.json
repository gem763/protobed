She didn\u2019t want to steal, but the store had been leveled, and looters were already ransacking it, so she figured she would see what she could find.\n\nWhat she found first, it turned out, was a bloated body by the store\u2019s entrance. He appeared to have drowned, Smith said.\n\nLater, Smith and a friend went to a trailer park to check on a coworker who lived there.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in his trailer but we found his body swollen up in the water,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the punishing sun outside Treasure Cay Airport on Thursday, Smith and hundreds of other stranded Bahamians waited for relief flights on Thursday that weren\u2019t guaranteed to come.\n\nFrom afternoon until night, stories of epic survival struggles permeated the crowd. Several told Reuters of running to neighbors\u2019 homes after theirs were destroyed, only for those homes to crumble as well.\n\nEven those whose houses survived say they must leave Abaco to find work, childcare and medical services. \u201cThere is simply nothing left there,\u201d said Anita Pinder, a 38-year-old mother of two. \u201cIt has vanished. It\u2019s just rubble.\u201d\n\nWhile they waited, the survivors relayed the traumas of the preceding days, scenes of drowned bodies, destroyed homes and the constant, nauseating smell of rotting flesh.\n\n\u201cYou smell the decomposing bodies as you walk through Marsh Harbor,\u201d said Sandra Sweeting, 37. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere. There are a lot of people who aren\u2019t going to make it off this island.\u201d\n\nSome of the waiting masses were promised a departure on Bahamasair, others on relief flights from volunteer groups or charters. Some were simply at the airport without a plan, hoping to land a ride to Nassau or the United States, and still others were there seeking supplies.\n\nThe small airport in Treasure Cay, a sliver of land connected to Abaco known for its resort, is now in ruins, its buildings toppled, the forest behind it stripped naked so the trees look like used matchsticks.\n\nBottles, trash and dirty puddles span the lot by the runway. Splintered chunks of roof, sprawled across the lot like beached whales, became bleachers for tired survivors, heads covered in shirts, towels and hats to soothe the hours of merciless Caribbean sun.\n\nAs would-be evacuees clamored for answers from anyone who looked to be in charge, tensions mounted. Police, as well as officers from the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, in camouflage and carrying weapons, kept the peace as locals argued over access to supplies coming in on relief flights.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an urgent need to get people off this island,\u201d said Marine Seaman Elmore Steele, 24.\n\nSteele, speaking to Reuters through dark glasses, gun pointed at the ground, said he has not seen any violence, and would neither confirm nor deny reports of violence breaking out in Abaco.\n\nResidents and visitors catch a flight from the island devastated by Hurricane Dorian at the airport in Treasure Cay, Abaco, Bahamas, September 5, 2019.

REUTERS/Aleksandra Michalska\n\nNIGHT AT TREASURE CAY\n\nDorian, the most powerful hurricane on record to hit the Bahamas, swept through the islands earlier this week, leveling neighborhoods and knocking out key infrastructure. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people are still missing. The death toll, which currently stands at 30, is likely to shoot up.\n\nThe Treasure Cay airport has no lights, so planes cannot take off after sunset. As the sun sunk low in the sky, tensions crescendoed. Crowds mobbed a Bahamasair organizer taking names for its final flight.\n\nAs the company furiously rushed families aboard, others raced between idling charter jets, asking if each had any space.\n\nWhen the dust settled, some 20 to 30 evacuees were forced to sleep in cars or make camp at the airport. Others left, though the sheer destruction of Abaco warded many off traveling away from the airport.\n\n\u201cThere is no community there,\u201d said stranded evacuee Wendy Hawkes. \u201cIt\u2019s just gone.\u201d\n\nTwo police officers stayed to serve as security guards, handing out water, cookies, cakes, tents and sleeping bags from a shed where incoming supplies were being stored.\n\nBy midnight, clusters of travelers dotted the flat expanse of total darkness that hours earlier had bustled with the chaos of a rescue mission. The stars shone bright in the dark, stragglers left to chat the night away or try to sleep against the faraway chorus of singing frogs.\n\n\u201cEveryone is quite calm,\u201d said Inspector Addison O. Ferguson, the supervising security guard. Ferguson downplayed reports of violence in Dorian\u2019s wake, saying most loiterers are just survivors looking for places to sleep.\n\nHawkes and her husband, Christopher Kennedy \u2014 a U.S.-based couple who had spent six months house-sitting for a family friend in Marsh Harbor \u2014 got food from a Bahamian customs worker they\u2019d befriended earlier. She brought them leftovers from her family\u2019s barbecue.\n\nAn emotional Hawkes, whose residence was largely destroyed, described seeing neighbors standing outside their front doors with shotguns, to ward off looters.\n\n\u201cThe dogs in the neighborhood would start to bark, and we\u2019d worry that people might be coming who shouldn\u2019t be coming,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when you start to realize there is danger here, now, not just the fear of dysentery later.\u201d\n\nDAWN DEPARTURE\n\nThe next morning, crowds began to gather by the runway as early as 4 a.m. They included many of the previous night\u2019s stranded, as well as a new crop of evacuees hoping to get on Bahamasair flights.\n\nCharters began arriving around 8 a.m. As survivors flocked toward pilots, in hopes of negotiating seats on flights, one family of 12 decided to split up.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nA flight to Nassau had four extra seats, so some flew to look for new housing, while the rest stayed behind. With cell service virtually nil in Abaco, the choice represented an indefinite parting.\n\nOn the flight, which included three Reuters reporters, 22-year-old Paul Manochka fretted about the future as the flight headed toward Nassau, the capital city.\n\n\u201cNassau is so small, so overpopulated already, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll find anything,\u201d Manochka said. \u201cWe might have to go to another island, but there are no jobs on the other islands.\u201d", "description": "Sam Smith, 25, was on her way to what was left of the local grocery store on the decimated Bahamian island of Great Abaco when she saw her first dead body.", "authors": ["Nick Brown", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427085564&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8526D", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
