In a tweet hashtagged #YangGang, AB touted the New York tech entrepreneur and universal basic income proponent\u2019s innovative ideas and concern for the average American. In under 24 hours, the post got 2.1K retweets and 13.8K likes.\n\nSaturday morning, Bryant was back at it. The 2002 second-round NFL draft pick for the Dallas Cowboys tweeted out eight reasons to support Andrew Yang for president:\n\nAntonio Bryant Is Not That AB\n\nWithin just four hours, \u201cAB\u201d had hundreds of retweets and nearly 3,000 likes on his second Yang tweet. His Twitter page is popular enough (with almost 95K followers) that Bryant has been getting hate tweets over the last month intended for another NFL wide receiver, Antonio Brown. In September, Brown\u2019s trainer Britney Taylor filed a lawsuit against him alleging sexual assault and rape. Bryant has had to repeatedly clarify: \u201cWrong AB!\u201d\n\nThe level of engagement with Bryant\u2019s endorsement of Andrew Yang says a lot about the presidential hopeful\u2019s popularity on the internet.\n\nThe likes and retweets on his Yang posts are on the same order of magnitude as most of the other AB tweets. And Touchdown Brown\u2019s Twitter page has 1.6 million followers.\n\nMaybe football fans appreciated it when Yang spoke out for them last month. He wasn\u2019t happy with the Democratic debate scheduled for the same time as an NFL season game.\n\nOther Andrew Yang Celebrity Endorsements\n\nAntonio Bryant is far from the first celebrity to endorse Andrew Yang for president. The businessman with an innovative political platform and upbeat personality has racked up an impressive roster of endorsements.\n\nOther Andrew Yang celebrity endorsements include billionaire engineer and business magnate Elon Musk. In August, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO simply tweeted, \u201cI support Yang.\u201d He then added: \u201cHe would our first openly goth president. I think this is very important.\u201d It\u2019s true.\n\nYang has also received campaign donations from Jack Dorsey, founder and CEO of Twitter. Dorsey, who also founded Square, has also contributed to Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s campaign. (Perhaps because all three support cryptocurrency?)\n\nOther celebrities who\u2019ve donated their own money toward nominating Yang in 2020 include powerhouse Hollywood A-lister Nicolas Cage and Weezer frontman, Rivers Cuomo.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all of Andrew Yang\u2019s celebrity endorsements. Other famous Yang supporters include YouTube royalty Casey Neistat (who has 11.5 million subscribers). Then there\u2019s fellow YouTube A-lister Ethan Klein, with 6.6 million subscribers to the h3h3 channel he produces with his wife, Hila Klein. And don\u2019t forget Tommy Chong of comedy duo Cheech and Chong.\n\nAndrew Yang racked up many of these endorsements in Q3 2019. That same quarter, his fundraising jumped an astounding 257% from $2.8 million in Q2 to $10 million Q3. That puts Andrew Yang in the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates by fundraising prowess. It was only a million shy of Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 Q3 take.\n\nYang is shaping up to be the dark horse of the Democratic presidential primary.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/andrew-yang-ap-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
