Friday's summit shifted the argument to child predators.\n\nMultiple officials noted that 90% of submissions to a child exploitation tip line, used by tech companies to notify authorities of misuse of their platforms, came from Facebook. If Facebook began to use strong encryption practices, authorities would lose some of that visibility.\n\nChanging the debate: Barr is explicitly narrowing his case for limiting encryption to chat apps and data at rest (i.e. data sitting on a hard drive). But encryption is also important for \"data in transit\" \u2014 it's what prevents eavesdroppers from capturing banking or e-commerce transactions.", "description": "Attorney General Barr and his team laid out their case for weakening encryption at an event last week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/OprS166Qs5XCJlgxw0S8EKP-giQ=/0x257:3000x1944/1920x1080/2019/10/08/1570544315466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
