I thought it was brilliant, a great response. I love a bit of banter like that, and I have no problem with comments like that.\n\n\u201cIt just says to me that players believe in their own ability. They want to be in the squad and they think they are good enough to be in the starting side.\u201d\n\nDavies said his comment was made purely \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d\n\nHe was struggling to find the right words, anyway, since he was not actually expecting to get the nod for the game at Oita Stadium.\n\n\u201cThe back row (forwards) have been outstanding in my eyes and I was a little bit shocked to get the call. But, like he (Gatland) said, I believe in myself and now I\u2019ve got the chance to show that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just worked hard really, every training session. You get disappointed with selection but it\u2019s about doing your best for the team then. You working hard makes the team train a bit better.\u201d\n\nGatland said it was hard to overlook Tipuric, who scored one of six Wales tries in their opening 43-14 win against Georgia. But intensifying competition for places is a necessity, with England or France to follow in the quarterfinals if Wales beats Fiji on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really happy with Tipuric\u2019s form but it\u2019s an opportunity to look at someone else, just in case he does pick up an injury,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cIt will show us whether James can fit into that spot.\u201d\n\nJames has one test try to his name, while his elder brother has 16. His tally includes four overall in World Cup play, one of those coming in the win against Georgia.\n\nBut even if both brothers score against Fiji, the Barrett boys will still have one over on them.\n\nBeauden, Scott, and Jordie all scored tries when New Zealand routed Canada 63-0 last Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New Zealand has the Barrett brothers, and Wales has the Davies boys running out for the Rugby World Cup match against Fiji on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
