Jordan Fights for Justice in a Suit", "language": "en", "text": "Your sweater-wearing boyfriend Michael B. Jordan is back and this time he\u2019s fighting for justice in a suit. Based on a true story, Just Mercy, which features Brie Larson and Jamie Foxx, tells the tale of Bryan Stevenson (Jordan) who graduates from Harvard Law and moves to Alabama to fight for the wrongfully condemned and those unable to receive proper representation. There, he meets Walter McMillian (Foxx), who is sentenced to death for the murder of a young girl. But he didn\u2019t do it. With help from a local activist (Larson), they do their best to right wrongs. If anyone can do it, it\u2019s Killmonger, Captain Marvel, and Electro, right? Out in select theaters this December 25, Just Mercy is the movie that\u2019ll make even your most talkative relatives from out of town sit and listen.\n\nRelated", "description": "Watch the latest trailer for Michael B.
