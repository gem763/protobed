Very emotive imagery and language. Very important messages,\u2019 one viewer wrote on Twitter while another agreed: \u2018#SevenWorldsOnePlanet has everything you need \u2013 fantastic awesome photography, suspense, drama, horror and romance. Hats off to Attenborough and the huge team behind this stunning work \u2013 as always.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as one of the nation\u2019s most well-known champions of conservation and protecting animals of all species, does Sir David Attenborough refrain from eating meat too, or is the national treasure still an omnivore?\n\nIs Sit David Attenborough a vegetarian or vegan?\n\nIn 2017 Attenborough revealed to the Radio Times that he\u2019d: \u2018given up meat, not for ideological reasons, I just don\u2019t care for it too much. I do eat fish. Poor fish,\u2019 and in a separate interview with Louis Theroux he revealed that his reasons for becoming \u2018increasingly vegetarian\u2019 were both for health and ethical reasons.\n\nSir David Attenborough, who has spoken of the \u2018tragic, desperate mess\u2019 human beings have made of the planet in the past. (Picture: PA)\n\nWhile he wouldn\u2019t label himself as a vegetarian, Attenborough did reveal to the Radio Times back in April 2019 that he eats \u2018very little meat at all\u2019 these days:\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not a vegetarian in the sense that I would actually throw up if I saw or touched a piece of meat, but I eat very little meat at all,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018Poultry a bit, but mostly fish. And I think most people are doing the same. The world is moving towards a dependancy on fish. And heaven help us, what we\u2019re doing to the ocean at the same time; we are crippling its fertility. So it\u2019s a very, very serious problem.\u2019\n\nWhen is Seven Worlds, One Planet next on TV?\n\nIn each episode of Seven Worlds, One Planet, the documentary will focus on a new continent, shining a spotlight on the unique animals that live there and the threats that they face daily as a result of the environment and climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the first episode focused on Antarctica and the threats posed to the species that live there due to the ocean warming, next week\u2019s episode will take a fascinating look at the rarely seen animals who inhabit Asia, travelling from the desert, to the jungle and to the highest mountains on earth.\n\nEpisode 2 of Seven Worlds, One Planet will air on BBC One again, on Sunday 3 November 2019 at 6.15pm.\n\nSeven Worlds, One Planet continues Sunday at 6.15pm on BBC One.", "description": "Sir David Attenborough had us all weeping as the first episode of his new series, Seven Worlds, One Planet aired on BBC One on Sunday night.", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92933259_1572255584.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
