An independent report in February this year described its workplace as \u201ctoxic\u201d.\n\nAmnesty said the union\u2019s course of action was disappointing.\n\nUnite believes the proposed cuts will \u201cgreatly reduce\u201d the charity\u2019s ability to deliver critical human rights work, and will result in the loss of expertise.\n\nThe union said it had no option but to ballot its members, given management\u2019s refusal to consider using donations to keep people in work, rather than using them to boost reserves. The organisation has 755 staff.\n\nAlan Scott, Unite\u2019s regional co-ordinating officer, said: \u201cUnite has exhausted all the available dispute resolution options open to it, including meetings at the conciliation service Acas.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Amnesty\u2019s management has refused to countenance reducing the amount of money being pumped into reserves in order to save jobs, and therefore members felt they had no option but to ballot for industrial action.\n\n\u201cAmnesty\u2019s management can still have the opportunity to prevent industrial action by tabling proposals that redundancies will be avoided by using a fraction of its reserves.\u201d\n\nUnite said the redundancies were a direct result of overspending by the senior management team.\n\nA spokesman for Amnesty said: \u201cIt is disappointing that Unite has decided to ballot its members employed by Amnesty International for industrial action. However, we fully recognise and support Amnesty International employees\u2019 right to strike.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to everyone who has engaged constructively with the consultation and enabled us to reduce the number of redundancies. Nonetheless, this provides little solace to those at risk of losing their jobs.\n\n\u201cWe deeply regret that these redundancies have been made necessary due to harsh financial realities and the need to put the secretariat on to a more stable footing for the future. This is a painful and difficult decision, and we will do everything in our power to support impacted staff.\n\nAmnesty International to make almost 100 staff redundant Read more\n\n\u201cRegrettably, we do not have the option to further reduce the level of reserve as it is at the absolute minimum to ensure the fiscal future of the organisation.\u201d\n\nOne insider at Amnesty said the threatened redundancies were the \u201cfinal straw\u201d for many staff at the organisation, who feel they have been treated badly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had damning wellbeing reports one after another. But the way they are conducting the consultation, we feel no lessons have been learned,\u201d another source said.\n\nThe crisis at Amnesty emerged last year when Ga\u00ebtan Mootoo, 65, a senior researcher, killed himself at his Paris office, leaving a note blaming work pressures and a lack of support from management. His death was followed by several reviews. One, conducted by James Laddie QC, found that \u201ca serious failure of management\u201d had contributed to Mootoo\u2019s death.\n\nA subsequent independent review of workplace culture found a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d at the organisation after a restructuring process.", "description": "Employees urge charity to consider using donations to fund jobs as management say job losses are unavoidable", "authors": ["Karen Mcveigh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d4eff91bfe6bc62e94be15ab40b3060a902341e/0_1054_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bba8bd07c72c07e4d77ea5e43055a8a8", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
