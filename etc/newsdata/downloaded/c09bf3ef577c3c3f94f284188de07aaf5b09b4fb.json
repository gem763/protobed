But It Matters.", "language": "en", "text": "In emphasizing both Rudy\u2019s silliness and enterprising spirit, \u201cDolemite Is My Name\u201d might reflect how much attitudes have changed since the Blaxploitation era died down in the late 1970s. At the time and for many years after, the films were wildly popular \u2014 and polarizing. There were many reasons to speak out against them: They almost always depicted black people in impoverished settings populated by pimps, prostitutes and drug dealers; they often wrapped the idea of black power in a superficial depoliticized bow; and, as the genre became more popular, black representation behind the scenes became minimal. \u201cSweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song\u201d and \u201cShaft,\u201d directed by Melvin Van Peebles and Gordon Parks, may be responsible for kicking off the genre, but the Blaxploitation films that followed and boasted black directors or writers were rare.\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P., Jesse Jackson and others campaigned for more \u201cpositive\u201d portrayals on screen \u2014 like, say, \u201cCornbread, Earl and Me\u201d or the rural family drama \u201cSounder.\u201d Even some of the stars of the genre expressed a measure of regret over their participation: \u201cThe stereotypes that we have are often what we perpetuated ourselves,\u201d Pam Grier, the star of \u201cFoxy Brown,\u201d said in the 2002 documentary \u201cBaadAsssss Cinema.\u201d \u201cI broke them, but I also created some, because everyone thought a black woman is a whoop-your-butt sister all the time.\u201d\n\nStill, for a brief period, black performers were getting steady work. Audiences were seeing more black people on screens than ever before, and thanks to characters like John Shaft, Foxy Brown and Youngblood Priest in \u201cSuper Fly,\u201d they were finally the heroes (and antiheroes). An entire generation of black artists have recalled fond memories of watching wild movies like \u201cDolemite\u201d as children, and have lovingly spoofed the genre in their own films (\u201cI\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka\u201d; \u201cUndercover Brother\u201d). \u201cThey\u2019re not these high-quality pictures,\u201d Mr. Murphy recently told The New York Times. \u201cBut black people, ourselves, we were just excited to see ourselves. We never felt like they were exploitation.\u201d\n\nThat tension between representation and exploitation is bubbling beneath the surface of \u201cDolemite Is My Name.\u201d Even as he gains a following through his self-released albums and live performances, Rudy refuses to tone down his profane and highly sexual material for radio play and mainstream audiences. Instead, he hopes his comedy will \u201cconnect him with the people.\u201d (Presumably, \u201cthe people\u201d are not white or the black intelligentsia.) He\u2019s not concerned about stereotypes \u2014 again, his character Dolemite is a pimp \u2014 but he does have an innate desire to inspire others like him, who might have the odds stacked against them. \u201cI want the world to know I exist,\u201d he says.\n\nThe final minutes of the film take place on the day of the \u201cDolomite\u201d premiere. As Rudy and his friends and collaborators make their way in a limo, the reviews they read in the paper are harsh: \u201cDullemite,\u201d one critic calls it. Yet when they get to the theater, an exuberant crowd awaits them. Rudy encounters a young fan who proudly boasts that he\u2019s listened to all of his albums and copies his rhyme-play, except \u201cI make it about me!\u201d\n\nThe moment is unabashedly earnest and doesn\u2019t attempt to engage with the valid critiques of the films, or the fact that most blaxploitation stars of the era struggled professionally and financially when Hollywood lost interest in telling black stories. But what it does conjure up is a re-evaluation of whose life gets to be the subject of dramatization \u2014 Rudy Ray Moore wasn\u2019t a civil rights leader (\u201cMalcolm X,\u201d \u201cSelma\u201d), nor was he an extraordinarily talented performer or athlete (the James Brown biopic \u201cGet On Up,\u201d \u201cAli\u201d).\n\nAnd how: The recreation of the \u201cDolemite\u201d scenes are silly, but Mr. Moore\u2019s ambitions are taken seriously in \u201cDolemite Is My Name.\u201d In Mr. Murphy\u2019s performance the Blaxploitation star is never treated as caricature, but with respect and empathy (when that movie producer comments that Rudy looks \u201cdoughier\u201d than the typical black leading man, pain briefly flickers across his face).", "description": "The 1970s genre of blaxploitation was polarizing for black audiences.
