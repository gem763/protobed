With Labour\u2019s leadership still under pressure over its ambiguous position on Brexit, senior figures hope that announcing eye-catching policies can refocus a coming election on its plans for public services.\n\nThe Observer also understands that the party is seriously considering a plan that would make care services for the over-65s free at the point of use, excluding accommodation costs.\n\nThis would deal with the long-running crisis in social care, but may well require tax increases.\n\nPledging to scrap Ofsted will cause huge debate. While some teaching unions have campaigned for the move, the inspectorate has denied a claim by Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, that it is biased against schools with more socially deprived intakes.\n\nIn an interview with the Observer today, Rayner said that England\u2019s schools inspectors were fuelling a crisis in teacher recruitment and failing to give parents an accurate account of school standards.\n\n\u201cWe would abolish Ofsted and we would replace it with a different system,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe Ofsted measures poverty. It measures deprivation. It doesn\u2019t measure excellence. And I think Ofsted has to measure excellence. It\u2019s driving these competitive league tables.\n\n\u201cI want parents to have confidence that regardless of where your child is educated or what your child\u2019s abilities are, they will get the best possible education. And at the moment the current Ofsted system does not measure that.\u201d\n\nShe also pledged to roll out a national version of the London Challenge, an \u00a380m New Labour improvement programme credited with helping to improve the capital\u2019s secondary schools. It would be led by the National Education Service Labour has already pledged to create.\n\n\u201cInstead of seeing schools as competing with each other, they should be collaborating with each other, and teachers should be enabled and empowered to teach in the classroom,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the moment, they\u2019re not given the tools with which to do that. You can see that in a number of things \u2013 in the curriculum, in the way that teachers are leaving the profession at record levels. I believe that the whole system at the moment is a hothouse to pitch school against school.\u201d\n\nRayner said Ofsted\u2019s rating system, which sees schools described as outstanding, good, requiring improvement or inadequate, did not give parents \u201ca clear understanding of what a school is and how good a school is\u201d.\n\nUnder the Labour plan, Ofsted would be abolished and replaced with a \u201ctwo-phase\u201d inspection system. All education providers would be subjected to regular \u201chealth checks\u201d led by local authorities. Where concerns arose, more in-depth inspections would be conducted by specialists.\n\nRayner said: \u201cCertainly some of the things that I\u2019ve been made aware of, when I\u2019ve gone round schools, is some of the gaming that goes on [during inspections]. There is no better judge of whether that school is right for your child [than] by actually physically going into the school and seeing whether the school environment is right for them. At the moment they\u2019ve been weaned off some of that.\u201d\n\nShe said that handing inspections to another authority was not a rebadging exercise. \u201cWe\u2019re removing the high-stakes single-point testing that Ofsted are doing currently,\u201d she said. However, the party will face criticism that removing the rating system will mean parents will struggle to understand whether a school is good or bad.\n\nIt means Labour is planning huge changes to the education system should it come to power. Jeremy Corbyn has already pledged that a Labour government would abolish Sats for seven- and 11-year-olds, as well as plans for baseline assessments for reception classes.\n\nIt is also understood that John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, could announce that care for over-65s should be free. The move, similar to measures already in place in Scotland, would spare millions of people from high care costs. However, it would require billions in funding, potentially through higher tax.\n\nLabour refused to confirm that the policy would be announced, but said: \u201cLabour in government is committed to creating a national care service to ensure people are able to access the services so desperately needed.\u201d", "description": "Party also considering free care services for the over-65s as it prepares to fight possible snap poll", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd4f795952e344b0fa5199d4548a6cec718d94c/0_218_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dfcf50b50cea3f2786408dd56b5b5aa5", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
