(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney has agreed to delay a subpoena seeking President Trump\u2019s tax returns until Tuesday, while a federal judge considers Trump\u2019s lawsuit seeking to have the subpoena thrown out.\n\nThat delay was announced late Thursday in a letter signed by both Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. (D) and Trump\u2019s private attorneys. Vance said he would not enforce a subpoena sent to Trump\u2019s longtime accountants, Mazars USA, until Oct. 1.\n\nVance is investigating hush-money payments made during the 2016 campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Trump. Trump sued to stop Vance\u2019s subpoenas earlier this month \u2014 arguing that, because he is president, he is immune from any criminal investigation by a local prosecutor.", "description": "Delay will provide time for a federal judge to consider a Trump lawsuit seeking to have the subpoena thrown out.", "authors": ["David A.
