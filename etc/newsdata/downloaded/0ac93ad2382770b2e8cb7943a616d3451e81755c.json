We also call on the public to get behind this dispute and your postal workers.\n\n\"We are very proud of our members today. They have stood by their union in record numbers and given hope to workers across the nation.\"\n\nRoyal Mail said it was \"very disappointed\" in the result of the ballot.\n\nIt added that the vote doesn't necessarily mean strikes will take place.\n\n\"A ballot result for industrial action does not necessarily mean there will be industrial action,\" the firm said in a statement.\n\n\"We are still in mediation with the CWU. Under our Dispute Resolution Procedure, set out in the Agenda for Growth, we are committed to reaching a resolution. No industrial action can be taken, and formal notification of industrial action cannot be given, before the conclusion of the Dispute Resolution Procedure.\n\n\"We want to reach agreement. There are no grounds for industrial action. Industrial action - or the threat of it - is damaging for our business and undermines the trust of our customers.\n\n\"Royal Mail wants to transform to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs as we post fewer letters and receive more parcels. Working together at pace, the transformation is about ensuring a more sustainable Company, a fairer working environment, the best terms and conditions in our industry and a contemporary Universal Service.\"", "description": "The dispute is over the implementation of a so-called Four Pillars Agreement that was reached last year", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article2118802.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Royal-Mail-Van-and-worker.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
