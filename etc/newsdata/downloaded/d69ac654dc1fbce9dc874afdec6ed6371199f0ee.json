It missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue estimates by about $175 million.\n\nAlphabet shares lost 1.6% after-hours, to $1,268.50, nearly erasing the 1.95% gain notched in regular trading when Reuters, citing sources, reported Google had made an offer to acquire U.S. wearable device maker Fitbit Inc <FIT.N>.\n\nGoogle has increased spending in recent years on areas including cloud computing and consumer electronics that it views as essential to maintaining its industry leadership in the face of stiff competition from Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> and Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O>.\n\nThe new businesses are pushing Google into sales of subscriptions, devices and technology licenses. But it has had to invest in people, facilities and content. Google is on track to hire more than 20,000 people this year, in large part to staff its newer units.\n\nNicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said he was not overly concerned by the spending.\n\n\"CEO Sundar Pichai can turn off the speculative spending at any time if he suddenly becomes more interested in profitability \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we suspect most investors would rather he stuck to the approach,\" Hyett wrote in a note.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphabet reports highest-ever quarterly expenses: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ALPHABET-RESULTS/0H001QXFP954/eikon.png\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphabet provides limited product-level financial disclosures compared with some peers, leaving investors increasingly uncertain about how pressures including regulatory scrutiny, advertiser boycotts and global trade tensions are affecting operations.\n\nFor instance, Alphabet reported $1.5 billion in unrealized losses in the third quarter from shares held in other companies, helping negate about $1 billion in profit. But an Alphabet spokeswoman declined to disclose which investments lost money.\n\nProfit also was hurt by a $554 million charge from a settlement with French tax authorities in September.\n\nAlphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, told financial analysts that the company's revenue growth rates underscored \"the strength and vibrancy\" of the company.\n\n\"In the last 12 months, we're generating over $150 billion in total revenues, that's about $25 billion of growth in the last year,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOSTLY PURSUITS\n\nGoogle has tried to demonstrate that its cloud-computing business is roaring, disclosing last quarter about $2 billion in revenue and saying that plans continued to hire thousands to stoke the unit's growth.\n\nIn hardware, Google's debut in May of the Pixel 3a, its most affordable smartphone yet, went well, according to technology analysts. It boosted Google's overall smartphone sales this summer in a typically slow quarter.\n\nGoogle also has tried to reassure investors that there is no weakness in its YouTube video unit, while expressing confidence in its business overall through share buybacks.\n\nBut spending has not been held back and higher costs loom as Google deals with clashes with regulators. Total quarterly expenses grew 25% compared to a year ago - a similar rate to recent periods - to $31.3 billion. It topped the previous high of $31.1 billion in the 2018 fourth quarter.\n\nAlphabet, which generates about 85 percent of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, reported total third-quarter revenue of $40.5 billion. In line with recent quarters, that was up 20% over last year. Analysts on average estimated 19.52% growth and $40.325 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nNet income for the third quarter rose to $7.1 billion, or $10.12 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of $8.811 billion, or $12.44 per share.\n\nThe operating margin was 23%, down from 24% in the second quarter.\n\nGoogle in the third quarter acknowledged investigations by the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice and 48 states into the company's competitive practices. It settled a privacy investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. It also got an additional 90-day reprieve from an export ban that would restrict its relationship with Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, one of its top partners in distributing mobile apps.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue estimates by about $175 million.
