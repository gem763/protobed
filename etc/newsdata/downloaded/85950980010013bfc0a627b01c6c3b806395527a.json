The bike costs nearly as much as a Tesla Model 3, and aims for a market that does not really exist: young, \u201cgreen\u201d and affluent first-time motorcyclists.\n\nThe sleek sport bike has been available for preorder in the United States since January. However, the bulk of the orders are coming in from existing and old riders, according to interviews with 40 of the 150 dealerships nationwide that are carrying the bike this year.\n\nThe dealers Reuters spoke with account for little over a quarter of LiveWire dealerships and are spread across Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, California, Nevada, New Jersey and New York.\n\nHarley has for years failed to increase sales in the United States, its top market accounting for more than half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-boomer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is finding it challenging to woo new customers.\n\nIn 2018, Harley posted the steepest sales decline in four years in the United States. U.S. sales are tipped to fall again this year.\n\nThe heavyweight motorcycle maker\u2019s stock price has declined by 42% in the past five years. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index has gained 47%.\n\nPRICE BARRIER\n\nWhen Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich announced LiveWire\u2019s launch last year, his hope was the ease of riding motorcycles with no gears or clutch would help attract young and environmentally conscious urban riders.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters in February 2018, Levatich said the bike would help address Harley\u2019s demographic problem.\n\n\u201cIt is more about the next century than the last century,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nThe preorders, thus far, have belied those hopes, according to the dealers.\n\n\u201cIt is appealing to a demographic that is already riding,\u201d said Gennaro Sepe, a sales manager at a Harley dealership in Chicago. His store has received four preorders for the bike. All of them are from existing riders.\n\nHarley declined to comment on LiveWire preorders.\n\nThe motorcycle maker is not the only company investing in battery-powered transportation.\n\nTougher emissions rules in Europe, China and the United States are forcing auto companies to switch to electrified models. A survey of U.S. millennial motorcyclists, published in February by the Motorcycle Industry Council, found 69% of the riders interested in electric motorcycles.\n\nHarley\u2019s dealers said they are getting inquiries from young customers, but are struggling to translate them into sales. A key reason: LiveWire\u2019s retail price.\n\n\u201cInterest is very high,\u201d said a sales manager at a New Jersey-based dealership, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media. \u201cBut once you get to pricing, interest is thrown out of the window.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Harley-Davidson is betting on electric motorcycles to attract the next generation of younger and more environmentally conscious riders to reverse declining US sales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harley-Davidson-Ebike.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
