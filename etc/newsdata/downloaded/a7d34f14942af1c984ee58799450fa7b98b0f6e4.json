On the podcast, he laid particular scorn on the new Rottweiler-Poodle hybrid, known as a Rottle or a Rottie-Poo.\n\nConron's original purpose in crossing a Labrador with a standard Poodle (which has a non-shedding coat) had been to provide a guide dog for a blind woman in Hawaii whose husband was allergic to dogs.\n\nThe resulting litter of three was small, but one of the puppies did not trigger the husband's allergies and was sent to Hawaii to be her guide dog.\n\nAs no one wanted the two remaining puppies, Conron asked the PR department at his work to spread the message of this new breed. Labradoodles quickly became popular in Australia and further afield.\n\nNow, designer breeds have become widespread -- but so has criticism of the consequences. Labradoodles, for example, can develop health problems common to Labrador Retrievers and Poodles such as hip dysplasia and eye disease.\n\nColin Tennant, a British expert on dog behaviour with 45 years of experience in the industry, told CNN: \"In essence, you are blindly breeding and altering genetics of the line without foreknowledge.\"\n\nAlthough Tennant said he doesn't have a problem with cross-breeding in general, he noted that breeders should pay more attention to dog's health.\n\nOne example, he said, was the Bichon Frise, whose eyes water. \"It must be in agony all the time,\" he explained. \"They breed the face flat so they look humanoid because we find that attractive, with no consideration for the permutations we are producing with regards the dog's welfare or health.\"", "description": "The creator of the Labradoodle cross-breed has said he inadvertently unleashed a \"Frankenstein('s) monster\".", "authors": ["Rory Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190926103202-labradoodle-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
