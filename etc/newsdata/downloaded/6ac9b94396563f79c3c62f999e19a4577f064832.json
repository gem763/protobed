By the next evening, the moon gains more heft.\n\nThe waxing moon approaches the quite bright Jupiter (-2 magnitude) on Oct. 3 and, from our earthly perspective, this young moon and Jupiter pull within 2 degrees of each other, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory.\n\nIn clear night skies, note that Jupiter has company, as the red supergiant star Antares appears to the lower right of our largest planet.\n\nThe fattening first-quarter moon sashays Oct. 5 to Saturn (0.5 magnitude, bright, but dimmer than Jupiter.) The ringed planet is to the upper left of Jupiter. The moon snuggles with Saturn that evening in the handle region of the constellation Sagittarius\u2019 tea kettle shape.\n\nAt the end of the month, the young moon ghoulishly treats our eyes to another dance with large, gaseous Jupiter on Oct. 31.\n\nVery low on the evening\u2019s west-southwest horizon, Venus emerges from a summer break, but stays low until December.\n\nMars returns from its summer vacation, where the planet hid in the sun\u2019s glare, but it loiters low on the morning\u2019s eastern horizon in late October.\n\nThe Orionids peak on the evening of Oct. 21-22. For this year\u2019s Orionids, don\u2019t expect much. It is predicted to be a small shower, with about 20 meteors each hour at peak, according to the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. Shooting stars are tiny bits of comet dust left behind as comets whiz by the sun. For the Orionids, it\u2019s specks of Halley\u2019s comet. Earth strikes these dusty trails, and these bits burn in our atmosphere, providing a free autumnal show.\n\nIf you\u2019re persistent, wait outside during the later evening and look up, you\u2019ll probably see a few meteors in an hour. On Oct. 22, the last quarter moon rises at 12:37 a.m., in the eastern time zone, according to the observatory. The moon\u2019s light will probably wash out some of the shower\u2019s peak.\n\nDown-to-Earth Events:\n\n\u25cfOct. 4 \u2014 \u201cImmortal Spacecraft: The Rise of In-Space Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing,\u201d a lecture by NASA\u2019s Benjamin Reed, at the Philosophical Society of Washington.
