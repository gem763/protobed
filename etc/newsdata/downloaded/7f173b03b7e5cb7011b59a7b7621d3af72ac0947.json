If you are at risk, please stop here and contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline for support. 800-273-8255\n\nI stood and looked down into the canyon, at a spot where, millions of years ago, a river cut through. Everything about that view is impossible, a landscape that seems to defy both physics and description. It is a place that magnifies the questions in your mind and keeps the answers to itself.\n\nVisitors always ask how the canyon was formed. Rangers often give the same unsatisfying answer: Wind. Water. Time.\n\nIt was April 26, 2016 \u2013 four years since my mother died. Four years to the day since she stood in this same spot and looked out at this same view. I still catch my breath here, and feel dizzy and need to remind myself to breathe in through my nose out through my mouth, slower, and again. I can say it out loud now: She killed herself. She jumped from the edge of the Grand Canyon. From the edge of the earth.\n\nI went back to the spot because I wanted to know everything.\n\nShow caption Hide caption My mom would see my kids several times a week, dropping by to play a game or read a book. She took them to a... My mom would see my kids several times a week, dropping by to play a game or read a book. She took them to a few Diamondbacks baseball games the last summer we lived in Phoenix. Laura Trujillo\n\nThe latitude and longitude where she landed, the last words she said to the shuttle bus driver who dropped her at the trail overlook, her mood when she met with her priest just four days prior. I read over the last letter she had mailed to my children. I looked for clues inside this little card with a cartoon penguin drawn on the front, written in block printing so my 5-year-old daughter could easily read it. My mom wrote of riding the Light Rail to a Diamondbacks game, of planting a cactus garden, of looking forward to summer in the already hot days of a Phoenix spring.\n\nI read and reread her last words written in cursive in the tiniest composition book that she had left in her Jeep, as well as the last text she typed, in which she both celebrates life and apologizes for it. I zoomed in on the photo she took with her iPhone from the ledge looking out to the sunrise that lit the canyon that morning to see if the rocks or shadows would share anything new. I replayed our last conversation, and each one before it that I could remember.\n\nI wanted to know every fact, every detail, to see everything she saw, because I didn\u2019t have the one thing I wanted \u2013 the why.\n\nI came back to the canyon for answers, or a deeper understanding of life and my mother, or maybe myself. But all I could see were the peaks miles away, the trees greener and prettier than I imagined, tiny dots of figures moving slowly up the switchbacks, and the stillness of the world.\n\nSuicide is as common and as unknowable as the wind that shaped this rock. It\u2019s unspeakable, bewildering, confounding and devastatingly sad. Don\u2019t try to figure it out, I told myself, stop asking questions, assigning blame, looking.\n\nYet there I stood, searching.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThe morning she jumped, she tried to reach me.\n\nI saw \u201cMom\u201d pop up on my phone shortly after 10 a.m. I was sitting at my desk on the 19th floor of the Cincinnati Enquirer building at a new job as the managing editor I hadn\u2019t quite settled into yet, just one photo of my children on my desk.\n\nI quickly texted: \u201cI love you mom. Crazy busy work day. Hard to break away to talk. But know I love you.\u201d\n\nOn my short drive home that night, I smiled when I noticed the iris were starting to bloom in our neighborhood. I stopped the car, hopped out and took a photo of an iris to text to my mom later. It was our favorite flower \u2013 hers because of the tenacity they need to grow in the rocky mountainside where she lived, and mine because when I was a kid, they bloomed for my birthday.\n\nI might take more after my dad; I have his olive skin and eyes that are so brown they are almost black, his look of quiet disdain when I am angry and his need for popcorn at the movies. But I was closer to my mom.\n\nWe lived 3.3 miles from each other for most of my adult life. Sometimes she would stop by to see my kids, and we would rub each other\u2019s hand while we talked about the day. When I moved to Ohio recently, we talked on the phone every day.\n\nWe could make each other laugh, and sometimes it seemed whatever she felt, I did, too.\n\nThat night, my husband said he needed to talk to me. \u201cCome upstairs, and let\u2019s sit down.\u201d\n\nI put a lasagna in the oven and walked upstairs and sat on our bed.\n\nWe\u2019d been fighting. We had moved from my hometown of Phoenix to Cincinnati three months earlier, and it had been a rough transition \u2013 a new city where we had no family, four kids in new schools, a house where the rent was too high and we seemed to be saying too often, \u201cCan you wait until next Friday?\u201d\n\nHe looked serious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your mom,\u201d John said.\n\nAnd somehow I knew. He read my face.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s gone. She was at the Grand Canyon. \u2026 They found her body in the canyon.\u201d\n\nHe used the word body.\n\nI couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t process order or time, and I took John\u2019s T-shirts out of a drawer to re-fold them.\n\n\u201cWe need to tell the kids,\u201d I said.\n\n- I started to cry in a way I wasn\u2019t sure I would ever stop, in a way that I was no longer aware that this might scare the children.\n\nHenry and Theo would understand this. They were 13 and 11, smart and mature. But Luke was only 9 and wouldn\u2019t even talk about the move. And Lucy was 5 and missing her grandma so much that every night she looked at a photo book my mother had recently made for them.\n\nWe came downstairs and found them waiting in the dining room, they knew something was up. My face was red and my eyes wet and swollen, which wasn\u2019t new, but part of who their mother had become lately. I sat on the wood floor leaning against the wall, pulling my knees to my chest. Lucy sat closest, and they formed a row next to me along the wall.\n\nThere was no way around this, no way to tell this.\n\n\u201cGrandma died,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nLuke and Lucy crawled into my lap. Henry looked afraid. Theo asked what happened.\n\n\u201cHer heart stopped working,\u201d I said. It was true, it did stop working. We would tell Henry and Theo the rest later, in private.\n\nI started to cry in a way I wasn\u2019t sure I would ever stop, in a way that I was no longer aware that this might scare the children. John called my psychologist, and although she worked 9 miles away, she happened to be at a church four blocks from our house. When she got to the house, I told her I was to blame.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYour mother made this choice.\u201d\n\nThe lasagna, I remembered. I yelled to John to take it out of the oven.\n\n\u201cLaura,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is not your fault, not your doing.\u201d\n\nBut maybe it was. The letter, I thought. I should not have sent that letter.\n\nThree days before, I had written an email to my mother. It was a letter I had written and deleted and written again. It talked about things that I\u2019d hidden for years, things I was finally trying to make her see. It doesn\u2019t matter, I told myself. It doesn\u2019t.\n\nShe is gone. She\u2019s gone because she wanted to be gone. But did I push her?\n\nNEWSLETTER: Personal updates from the writer and more on Surviving Suicide\n\nCounting backward\n\nLooking for answers after my mom's suicide David Wallace, The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nA few months before my mom died, in the fall of 2011, I sat in a Phoenix office with a psychologist, the first time I\u2019d done one-on-one counseling. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s making me sad, I told her.\n\nWe explored work. I loved my job working at my hometown newspaper. We explored family. I had a great husband and four wonderful kids.\n\nThen childhood. It was good, I told her. It was good, the bad couldn\u2019t take away that part. It was good, I said again, until slowly, the truth unraveled. The details came out one at a time, like from a leaky faucet, steady at first and then faster.\n\nI was 15 when I saw my stepfather naked.\n\nNot because I was looking, but because he wanted me to see.\n\nHe came into my room. Not because he needed to.\n\nHe told me not to say anything.\n\nAnd I knew I wouldn\u2019t. My mom was happy for what seemed to be the first time in her life. I couldn\u2019t ruin that, I told myself, no matter what he did to me. Close your eyes, count backward from 10. And again until it is over.\n\nPush it to a corner of your brain. Shut the box.\n\nFor years my stepfather raped me to the point that I questioned whether it was my fault. One day it stopped almost as quickly as it began, and I blocked it from my mind for decades. I told no one.\n\nI went to Sunday dinner at my mom\u2019s house, camped with her and my stepfather in their motor home in Flagstaff, and took care of their yellow Labrador, Moe, when they went skiing. I pretended it never happened until one day I couldn\u2019t.\n\nAfter a few appointments with my psychologist, I told my mom one evening in the front yard when she had stopped by my house. That day she didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t believe me, but she didn\u2019t seem surprised. She didn\u2019t reach over to hug me, didn\u2019t ask how, didn\u2019t say she was sorry. She went home to him.\n\nI struggled to understand how she didn\u2019t seem to want to know more, didn\u2019t seem angry with him, didn\u2019t seem to do anything about it. I was angry and sad in a way neither of us knew how to handle.\n\n- We\u2019re not supposed to blame ourselves when someone we love kills herself, but often do anyway. What if I hadn\u2019t moved away? What if I\u2019d kept quiet about my stepfather? What if I had answered her phone call that morning?\n\nFor a while we ignored the subject altogether. But slowly her denial gave way, and she started asking questions. She wanted to know how the man she knew, the one with the gentle heart who hired a homeless man to work in his bike shop, could be capable of this. We went days without talking, then talked until we both couldn\u2019t breathe from crying.\n\nOne night, maybe a month before she died, while she and I talked or mostly cried on the phone about how sorry she was and about how much it hurt me and how sorry I was and how much I missed her and needed her, she confronted him. I could hear her yelling at him with me on the phone: Did you do this? He kept saying, \u201cI don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Maybe he didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t. She was angry, yelling at him: \u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d\n\nHer husband was 66 and sick. He drank a lot, and a brain tumor and stroke left him dependent on her. My mom and I had been circling each other like wounded animals, each apologizing to the other, for a few months when I wrote and deleted and rewrote the letter and finally hit \u201csend.\u201d It didn\u2019t tell her anything she didn\u2019t know, but it spelled out that he had abused me for years, how hard it was to have him come into my room so many nights, and then there was this: I didn\u2019t tell her then because I wanted her to be happy. I told her I didn\u2019t forgive her, because I didn\u2019t need to. It wasn\u2019t her fault. I told her I loved her and needed her.\n\nWe\u2019re not supposed to blame ourselves when someone we love kills herself but often do anyway. What if I hadn\u2019t moved away? What if I\u2019d kept quiet about my stepfather? What if I had answered her phone call that morning?\n\nThe \"what if\" question held me the tightest at night, keeping me awake until the sun peeked through the shades.\n\nI needed to know if I was to blame.\n\nMy mom was a retired nurse and hospital administrator with a good pension. She had a book club and friends she hiked with weekly. While she hated that four of her grandchildren had moved so far away, she had four more who lived close and plans to visit the others soon. I needed to find out what I had missed. I needed to know, to understand how someone who seemed so happy could be so sad.\n\nI\u2019d comb through my mother\u2019s life, looking for clues. I\u2019d learn that she had been seeing a psychologist and had been prescribed antidepressants. I\u2019d talk to my sister, try to ask questions of my grandmother and aunt, and I\u2019d drive 966 miles to Florida to spend a week with my mom\u2019s best friend from when I was a child.\n\nI\u2019d learn everything I could from doctors who study suicide notes to psychiatrists who personalize medicine to treat depression. I would learn that suicide is now the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States, with numbers increasing in almost every state, and that money for research to better understand it remains low. I\u2019d explore the ugliness inside my own family and the ripples of sexual abuse.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Why we're sharing this story\n\nSUICIDE PREVENTION: It's one of the nation's top killers.

It wasn't on purpose, or it was subconscious that I could say it, but not write it yet. In my living room, I keep some of my favorite things from her, rocks collected from a trail near her home; notes she wrote the kids; the bendable and stretchy bunnies she sent. Laura Trujillo\n\nThe day before my mom\u2019s funeral, the church was quiet. It was May and already 100 degrees in Phoenix. I walked past the meditation chapel and through a healing garden and rock labyrinth to find the priest that my mom had been talking to the past few weeks.\n\nHe had a trim white beard, a bald head and round wire-rimmed glasses. He couldn\u2019t tell me what he had discussed with my mother but that she told him she thought she no longer needed counseling.\n\nI had learned that when some people decide to kill themselves, they seem more at ease than they have in a long time, because they know that if they show any suicidal signs or too much distress, others will try to talk them out of it.\n\nMy mom believed in God. I sat down and asked if my mom was OK. I thought he could explain.\n\nInstead of answering, he told me a story about his own mother who had died and how on an autumn day a few years ago he was lying in a hammock and he saw her again.\n\nHe was just a man in a Hawaiian shirt and Birkenstocks telling me a story.\n\nI wanted a new priest. I wanted someone to tell me my mom was OK.\n\nMy sister and I had talked and agreed on a few things: I would write the obituary, our mom would be cremated, the service would include a full Mass. We called it a Celebration of Life, as if there was such a thing in the moment.\n\n- They thought she wasn\u2019t strong enough to hear it. And maybe she wasn\u2019t.\n\nOne of my mom\u2019s favorite places was her garden, so we asked that friends bring flowers from their yard or someone else\u2019s. Roses and mums, prickly lantana and yellow branches of the Palo Verde lined the church. Lucy held Fred, a stuffed dog that was recently handed down to her by her biggest brother. Luke held Henry\u2019s hand.\n\nI wanted to ask my grandmother what happened, what she knew, the parts of the story she understood, her truth. Not right then, maybe later that week. But when I saw my grandma, she looked at me, my husband and our four children and she waved us off.\n\nShe blamed me, I learned later, as did my mom\u2019s sister and brother. My mom had told them I had told her about the abuse and she was upset. They thought she wasn\u2019t strong enough to hear it. And maybe she wasn\u2019t.\n\nTen minutes into the service, my stepfather walked in.\n\nAt the funeral I told stories of my mother, how she never wanted anyone to be cold, how she would knit caps for her grandchildren when they were babies, even in the summer, of how she collected socks for the homeless so their feet wouldn\u2019t be cold.\n\nIt was 34 degrees the morning she was found. She had on a lightweight jacket.\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d I told her, \u201cyou weren\u2019t alone. You weren\u2019t. And I hope you were not cold in the end.\u201d\n\nAs each person left the church, my mom\u2019s best friend handed them a piece of dark chocolate, my mom\u2019s favorite treat. It sat in my mouth taking forever to dissolve, like a communion wafer.\n\nA close call\n\nShow caption Hide caption My mom mailed sweet notes to my kids four days before she killed herself. We keep them on a shelf in the living room and... My mom mailed sweet notes to my kids four days before she killed herself. We keep them on a shelf in the living room and sometimes I notice my daughter Lucy reading them. I feel closer to her through her handwriting than photos. Laura Trujillo\n\nFor a while, Henry, Luke and Lucy each received a note from my mom in the mail. After we moved, she had sent cards and stickers, silly presents from the dollar store like stretchy rubber bunnies and colored beads, clutter that got caught in the vacuum cleaner, that I simultaneously loved and hated.\n\nTheo checked for weeks for a last letter that never arrived.\n\nI was angry at myself for not mailing all of the letters my kids had written her in the past weeks. But I didn\u2019t have a stamp or was in a hurry. I wondered if those notes would have sustained her until her pain could lift, medicine and therapy could work, or the burden of caring for her husband, who would die three months later, would pass.\n\nThere are researchers who will say that putting the onus on survivors is grossly unfair, that we need more money to understand suicide, to learn what works so we can do better.\n\nThey will say to look at how mental health screenings from primary care doctors or more training for therapists could reduce suicides. There are people who will say that a prevention measure such as a net or barrier could have saved my mother and that such measures buy more time for people to change their state of mind. They\u2019re all good things to think about, worthy places to direct anger or energy. But I spent most of my time looking inward.\n\nSometimes there were periods when all I could feel was her absence. I could look down at my knees, which wrinkle and bend in the same way as hers. But it wasn\u2019t her. I wanted to go be with her.\n\nThe summer after she died was the most difficult. I was working and taking the kids places and making dinner most nights, but even when I smiled or laughed, I was empty. I pretended I was fine, posted happy photos of my children on Instagram, and thought if I told friends that I was OK often enough it would be true.\n\nOnce a week, I ran 9 miles for the empty space, but all it did was give me time to think and wonder why. I would tick through the list of reasons why logically I should be happy. But something in my brain wouldn\u2019t let me get there.\n\nI went to counseling and lied to my therapist, saying the things I thought she needed to hear. I couldn\u2019t look her or anyone else in the eye and say I no longer wanted to live, even if it was true. I was afraid to say it out loud. She prescribed me antidepressants, which I reluctantly began to take.\n\nIt\u2019s a common feeling, this depression after losing someone to suicide, yet it often feels impossible to share. It\u2019s raw and scary, and sometimes it feels selfish or indulgent. My mom wasn\u2019t a child; she was 66, an adult who made her own decision. And yet it consumed me.\n\nMost of the time, as in the obituary that celebrated my mom\u2019s life, I neglected to mention how she died. I didn\u2019t want to tell people about my mother. Her suicide was not a secret, but it was a wound, and talking about it allowed people dangerously close to the darkest parts of myself. I didn\u2019t want to tell people that I had decided I didn\u2019t belong here anymore, that I had removed my seat belt while driving and sped toward a concrete wall underpass, jumped up to see if the pipes in our basement were strong enough to hold me or that I had fallen asleep hoping I wouldn\u2019t wake up. I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone that I had written notes telling my family goodbye.\n\n- Death seemed the only answer. One afternoon in the summer after she died, I took off work and bought a one-way, same-day plane ticket to Phoenix. I wanted to be with her in the canyon.\n\nMaybe we all are one step from the ledge. I couldn\u2019t understand it until I could.\n\nIt scared me.\n\nDeath seemed the only answer. One afternoon in the summer after she died, I took off work and bought a one-way, same-day plane ticket to Phoenix. I wanted to be with her in the canyon.\n\nI was crying. I told the kids I just needed to leave, to get out of the house for a bit. I was certain they would be better off without me. Theo handed me a note, I slid it in my purse without looking at it. I drove away.\n\nI got almost to the airport, and I pulled over into a parking lot. I was crying, and even though I wanted to die, I knew I couldn\u2019t drive, I couldn\u2019t go home, I couldn\u2019t be.\n\nI read Theo\u2019s note, handwritten in a thin magenta Sharpie on a 3-by-5 index card: \u201cI know U love me and I love U Theo.\u201d\n\nI could not do this. I saw my mom in Lucy, in her profile, in her eyes, the way she stood.\n\nI went home.\n\nShow caption Hide caption On a very bad afternoon, the summer after my mom died, when death seemed the only answer, my son Theo slipped this note into my... On a very bad afternoon, the summer after my mom died, when death seemed the only answer, my son Theo slipped this note into my purse before I left the house. I carried it in my wallet for years and now keep it on my dresser, a tiny piece of hope and love to see daily. Laura Trujillo\n\nTruth\n\nI have learned, as do many survivors of a family member\u2019s suicide, that I am now at risk. I accept that now and guard against it. It\u2019s a place of caution and checklists. A place where I know to not stay alone in my head too often and to say \"yes\" to walking the dog with my best friend.\n\nYears of therapy, antidepressants and luck have led me here. There was no aha moment with my psychologist, no time when everything suddenly felt clear, no moment when my guilt disappeared. Instead there was more a dull monotony of months of sessions talking through my worries and what ifs, and the reasons I shouldn\u2019t have them, until they slowly dissipated. I carried Theo\u2019s note in my wallet and later put it on my dresser to see each morning. In the worst times, I had friends who texted just to check in and a husband who knew to send a kid with me on errands so I wouldn\u2019t be alone. And with medicine, I now had the sense to listen.\n\nLEARNING TO COPE: Self-care tips in suicide survivors' own words\n\nIt took four years to tell Lucy the truth. I picked her up from her friend\u2019s house on my way home from work. It is a distance of 26 houses and two left turns.\n\nShe looked at me, this time as a 10-year-old, so much more grown up, not suspicious, not quite serious, just honest.\n\n\u201cTell me really,\u201d she said, \u201cHow did Grandma die?\u201d\n\nWhen I told her, Lucy looked sad and angry together. She got out of the car, dashed up the stairs to her room and slammed the door.\n\nI knocked.\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d\n\nShow caption Hide caption Sometimes when it feels overwhelming that my mom is gone, I look at Lucy.

This is a good memory of her with Lucy and me at one of our favorite Mexican food spots in Phoenix. Courtesy of Laura Trujillo\n\nI wanted to say so many things: How much her grandma loved her, how my mom adored Lucy \u2013 her first granddaughter after six boys. How my mom used to make Lucy a special doll cake each birthday. How much I missed her and how much it hurt me. How I squinted and tried to figure out how many of those times that my mom stopped by our house with a beautiful smile and a hug when she wasn\u2019t happy, that she must have been hiding it and I missed it.\n\nBut when she came out, maybe 20 minutes later, she just needed a hug.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do this,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t look up at me.\n\n\u201cWhat? Do what?\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise me. Just promise you won\u2019t do this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Lucy? Just tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Grandma did.\u201d she said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve decided that I need to live, not just for me, but my for children. I know what it felt like to be left behind.\n\nThe great unknown\n\nThere remained a yawning uncertainty. And questions, so many of them, about my mom.\n\nMy mom first saw the canyon when she was an adult, a visit with her sister shortly after she and my dad divorced. Later she hiked rim to rim with her sister \u2013 23.5 miles from the North Rim of the canyon and back up the south, a hike that is revered in Arizona, a point of pride \u2013 the equivalent of a 26.2 oval sticker on the back of your car. She hiked the last time with her husband, taking the easiest trail as his knees started to give out.\n\nThe year my mom took her life, 12 others died at the canyon, too \u2013 falls, heart attacks and suicides, mostly. Enough people die at our 58 national parks that the U.S. Forest Service has created a special team to deal with death. They are there to investigate and understand, to find the next of kin, to provide information and some context where there might not be any, and sometimes simply to stand quietly next to you.\n\nRanger Shannon Miller agreed to meet with me at the canyon four years to the day after my mom jumped.\n\nWill you be alone? She\u2019d asked me.\n\nNo.\n\nGood.\n\nNearing four years after she killed herself, a friend and I drove to the canyon from Phoenix at 1,000 feet above sea level, as a storm moved in and the sky darkened. It\u2019s just over a three-hour drive, a straight shot north on I-17 through the Sonoran Desert and then the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests. My mom would have made this drive in the middle of the night or just before dawn. As we gained altitude, the saguaros gave way to scrubby bushes and later to ponderosa pine trees at 6,900 feet. Mule deer and elk dotted the roadside. By the time we reached Flagstaff, about 90 minutes from the canyon in northern Arizona, it was snowing and the temperature had dropped more than 55 degrees.\n\nIt is a long time, Mom, to change your mind.\n\nShannon and I agreed to meet at Bright Angel Lodge, where you can pick up a permit to camp at the canyon\u2019s floor, reserve a mule to carry you down the trail, and stop in the gift shop to buy an \u201cI hiked the canyon\u201d T-shirt, a toddler-sized ranger replica uniform, and a dream catcher made by Native Americans for $26 or one not for $1.99.\n\nIn a row of books, the tales of the Harvey Girls and hiking trails, rafting and geology, I found something: \u201cOver the Edge: Death in the Grand Canyon, Gripping accounts of all known fatal mishaps in the most famous of the World\u2019s Seven Natural Wonders.\u201d It boasted: \u201cNewly Expanded 10th anniversary edition.\u201d A placard reads: \u201cGift Idea!\u201d\n\nI picked it up, glancing around to see if anyone was watching. There was the story of John Wesley Powell, the first to explore the river cutting through the canyon, and the TWA and United airplanes that collided over the rim in the 1950s and led to the creation of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nI flipped through, and on page 470, I found her.\n\nMy mom.\n\nI put it down.\n\nShannon met me in front of the lodge, and I followed her truck to the spot where they found my mother.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d she asked me. She had that just-right mix of ranger and detective, and her smile felt like a hug.\n\nWe walked down a concrete path along the canyon, juniper trees on the left, a ledge and waist-high metal pipe handrail on the right. I could see a short fence and jagged limestone that formed an overlook. When we neared the spot, Shannon pulled yellow caution tape from her bag and cordoned off the trail.\n\n\u201cYou might want some quiet,\u201d she said.\n\n- I looked around, worried how this intrusion could ruin someone\u2019s view on their only trip to the canyon. She reminded me that there are many places to see the canyon and for now, this was my spot.\n\nI looked around, worried how this intrusion could ruin someone\u2019s view on their only trip to the canyon. She reminded me that there are many places to see the canyon and for now, this was my spot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better this way,\u201d she said.\n\nThis spot along the 277 miles of canyon is known for one of the best views from the South Rim. The limestone here on the Kaibab layer is 270 million years old. It\u2019s the youngest layer of the canyon, an area that once was covered with warm, shallow sea. Its name is Paiute Indian and means \u201cMountain lying down,\u201d and somehow I like that image. It makes no sense and yet is perfect.\n\nThe rock at the bottom \u2013 the vishnu schist \u2013 is 2 billion years old, half as old as the earth. Shannon talked volcanoes and rivers, snow and dry wind, tectonic plates and tributaries widening the canyon, about how native people roamed this area for thousands of years.\n\nUp until 1858, when John Newberry was the first scientist to reach the canyon floor, the area was called the Great Unknown. And even with as much as we know, there is still some debate as to how the canyon formed and the Colorado River\u2019s relatively new role in it.\n\nHolding onto the rail, I peered over, looking down, farther now, to a second ledge about 100 feet below. There were pine trees and a pinon, scrubby brown earth and openness. It looked like a shelf.\n\n\u201cThere?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there,\u201d Shannon said.\n\n\u201cIt looks different,\u201d I said. Just 100 feet down, it already was a different terrain with different dirt and plants.\n\nIt\u2019s the Coconino layer, Shannon explained, a layer that formed 275 million years ago. The light sandstone forms a broad cliff. The lines you see in this layer, the cross-bedding that run through it, reveal the story of an area that used to be covered with dunes, the wind blowing them into shapes, over and over again. It appears there are waves within the rocks.\n\nI got lost in the geology for a moment, standing in a place that held rocks 2 billion years old, and my brain placed the two and six \u2013 no, nine \u2013 zeros to the right. That is not forever but an amount of time I could not understand.\n\nI focused on the facts. The trees and rocks, how the Colorado river snaked below almost exactly 1 mile down into the earth, the sound of a raven and the light rain that was slowly growing heavier and turning to snow.\n\nMy mom fell 5 million years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all I could say.\n\nTrying to understand\n\nJean Drevecky drove the Paul Revere shuttle bus that fourth Thursday morning of April, 2012. She would later tell the rangers that during her first round that morning she picked up a woman near Bright Angel Lodge who seemed calm. That woman was my mother. Jean remembered the woman sat alone, quiet, her hands in her pockets \u201clike she was cold.\u201d The woman got off the bus five minutes later. Phone records show that my mom called her husband several times that morning. He remembered only the one that came at 6:56. It lasted four minutes. She was crying.\n\nShe told him, \u201cThis is it. I am finished I cannot go on.\u201d\n\nHer husband told rangers he tried talking to her about all of the good things in life. The ranger report doesn\u2019t detail what he meant by that, but they had scuba-dived the Great Barrier Reef and taken a hot air balloon above Albuquerque, New Mexico. He found the adventurer in my mother, but he broke her, too. He broke us.\n\nShe did not say goodbye.\n\n\u201cYour mom must know this place pretty well,\u201d Shannon said, noting that of all the miles of canyons here, my mom knew the place to jump where she wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone else and would be easy to be found.\n\nI was quiet for a moment, for once not feeling the need to fill the space.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nI looked down the trail, to the 27 switchbacks I counted until they grew tiny and disappeared into the canyon.\n\nI\u2019d been here before, I realized. With her.\n\nShow caption Hide caption My mom and I hiked to the bottom of the Grand Canyon the summer after my freshman year of college. I try to remember the... My mom and I hiked to the bottom of the Grand Canyon the summer after my freshman year of college. I try to remember the details of the trip, but mostly remember how tired we were at the top. Courtesy of Laura Trujillo\n\nIt was the summer after my freshman year of college, from an overlook \u2013 this one.\n\nMy mom took just one day off from work, and we drove to the canyon on a Friday morning, sharing a double-bed in a hotel overlooking the South Rim. The next morning we woke before the sun to hike the South Kaibab Trail, 7.1 steep miles down.\n\n\u201cBetter down than up,\u201d she said in the happy singsong voice she used when any of us faced something difficult and that I now sometimes hear in my own voice. I try to remember the details, but only certain things stick out. Are the memories real or only built from photos? I had brought a Walkman that held the Depeche Mode \"Some Great Reward\" cassette tape. It was 1989, and I would not own a CD player for another three years.\n\nWe carried water and salami, string cheese and a peach. I still remember we didn\u2019t eat the peach, and the bumpy hike down turned the fruit to mush in my JanSport backpack.\n\nReaching the bottom, a severe drop in elevation to 2,570 feet, the temperature hit 101 degrees. Near the Colorado River it was as humid as a sauna.\n\nThat night we sat in a circle under the stars and listened to a ranger share a story about a mystery on the Colorado River. I leaned into my mom, her hair smelling like Ivory because she washed it with a bar of soap, and fell asleep.\n\nI have a photo of us at the top after hiking up Bright Angel Trail. She is smiling, her hair permed and curly. Mine is pulled up in a ponytail, likely with a scrunchie. It is hard to tell if I am happy or just exhausted. Every picture from the the past gets studied from time to time: Does she look happy? Was she happy? It\u2019s just one moment from almost 30 years ago, and I don\u2019t have the answer.\n\nHow does someone go from happy to suicide? Was she truly happy or did we just miss the clues?\n\nHad she been sick her whole life? Sometime after the funeral my sister and I discussed the day when we were kids that our mom set a fire in a bathroom garbage can. My mom put it out before it spread. Soon after, our grandmother and her grumpy miniature Schnauzer moved in with us.\n\n- So the thing with suicide is this: Everyone has their own part of a story, but many won\u2019t share. No one has the answer, and sometimes the bits they have, they lock inside. Or they remember the way they can, or want.\n\nAfter my mom died, we each tried to understand what happened and what we knew. My sister shared that at some point when I had been in middle school, my mom drove to a parking lot after her night shift at a hospital with a handgun she had bought for self-defense. She changed her mind.\n\nMy sister said that our grandmother told her that our mother was put in a hospital at some point before she got married, but when I asked my sister later about this she said she didn\u2019t remember and no longer wanted to talk about it. My mom\u2019s mother, brother and sister don\u2019t want to talk to me about my mom\u2019s suicide.\n\nSo the thing with suicide is this: Everyone has their own part of a story, but many won\u2019t share. No one has the answer, and sometimes the bits they have they lock inside. Or they remember the way they can, or want.\n\nAnd stories change over the years \u2013 memory, maybe, or survival. There are parts to this story that we each have but won\u2019t share. So none of us can see the contours and texture of this story, this woman, this life. We just have our disappointments, our myths and our guilt.\n\nFor four years, I was certain that the last letter my mom wrote had a stamp with the painting of the Grand Canyon on it. So certain that I never even checked, so certain that I couldn\u2019t even look at it until one day I did, and the canyon looked shallow. It actually was Cathedral Rock in Sedona, according to the U.S. Post Office. Even facts are our own, as are truths.\n\nWhen I recently asked my dad about my mom, if he remembered her being depressed or if there were signs, he said he doesn\u2019t remember any. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let things be, Laura?\u201d\n\nI told him that writing about it might help. Not me, but others.\n\nHis wife interrupted.\n\n\u201cYou might not know this, but my brother killed himself,\u201d she said. \u201cI blamed myself forever. He always called me before he left work to say, \u2018I love you, sis.\u2019 And one night he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLooking back, she said, that was unusual. \u201cI could have called him,\u201d she said, her voice disappearing, \u201cI could have checked.\u201d\n\nMy sister and I love each other. She is always polite, the one to simply smile when I say out loud what I am thinking. She also is the one who cleaned everything out of my mom\u2019s house, the one who claimed her ashes. She is the one who dropped off groceries weekly for our stepfather because she thought my mom would want that. She is the one who was called three months later when the newspapers were piled up in front of the house. Our stepfather was dead.\n\nThings fell on her that weren\u2019t easy, and there are stories she keeps to herself.\n\nPiecing together what we had\n\nMy mom knew there was a ledge; she would be easy to find. She knew there was no trail below; she wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone but herself. She had safety-pinned a tiny piece of paper onto her jacket with the name of her husband and his phone number. I wonder if the ranger is telling these details to make me feel better. I have a notebook and a pen, and we speak without emotion. This is better, I decide. I am a reporter learning the story. But I am also her daughter, trying to find answers.\n\n\u201cWe have people not as courteous as your mom,\u201d she tells me.\n\nThe first call to the park that April morning came at 7:15: A woman was threatening suicide. My mom had called her husband, telling him that this was it, she was ending it all. She told him she was at the canyon. He called the police, who alerted the National Park Service. Three rangers quickly searched 12.2 miles along the South Rim. By 10:45 a.m., as the weather cleared, the rangers launched a search helicopter. Within 15 minutes, they spotted her body.\n\nTwo rangers hiked down Bright Angel Trail and cut across the canyon where they walked another half-mile to reach my mother. They recorded the location.\n\nThe ranger zipped my mother\u2019s body into a bag, and that bag inside another. Because the winds were too strong, they couldn\u2019t fly her out that day, so he secured the bag to a skinny pine for the night. The temperature dropped to 28 degrees.\n\nThe next morning the same ranger hiked back to her body and waited until the same helicopter hovered overhead and dropped a basket. By happenstance, my friend Megan had hiked to the bottom of the canyon that morning. She saw condors, rare to see at the canyon, swooping close to the rim.\n\nWatching the birds, she almost didn\u2019t notice the helicopter. But hikers know what a helicopter means when a basket hangs below. People paused their hikes. Some crossed themselves and prayed, Megan said, or stood quiet. She didn\u2019t know who was in the basket. The helicopter was the only sound.\n\nThere were so many signs. It\u2019s easy to see them now.\n\nI learned later that my mother had told my sister she was staying at my grandmother\u2019s house and told my grandmother she was staying at my sister\u2019s house. They both had been worried, checking on her daily. My mom told her sister that she wanted to \u201cwalk in front of a truck\u201d and had told my sister she had been going to therapy, as she felt responsible for bringing her husband into my life.\n\nEarlier that week my mom had stopped to see her mother and given her one of her favorite turquoise necklaces that she made, looping a tiny silver heart into the clasp. We would learn that she had also recently moved her house into a trust for my sister and me and written her financial information and passwords in a green notebook. At the same time, she wrote letters full of hope and sweetness to her grandchildren. She went to Mass and talked to her priest.\n\nWhile researchers say most suicides are more impulsive, my mom\u2019s seemed to have left an obvious trail. She was feeling helpless, carrying blame, putting her affairs in order, giving away possessions. But it didn\u2019t look that way to any of us at the time.\n\nDespite all of the research, there still isn\u2019t a proven formula that can predict precisely who is going to kill themselves and who won\u2019t; which interventions work for everyone, or work for a while, and which don\u2019t; which words might save someone one day only to have them slip away the next. It doesn\u2019t make any sense why one person who demonstrates all the risk factors lives and another kills herself.\n\nThe only person who can explain is gone.\n\nSo we are left to guess, to piece together what we had. None of us had all of the pieces. The wreckage of my stepfather\u2019s behavior had left our family in a state of strain. We weren\u2019t sharing information or being honest with each other as we might have in smoother times, which made us normal.\n\nSomething the priest had told me stuck with me: \u201cAll families are difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cSome families just know it, and others don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe parked her white Jeep Liberty in the parking lot near Bright Angel Lodge. She wrote notes to her family in a tiny black and white composition book with her name handwritten on the front.\n\nIn one, she wrote, \u201cPlease don\u2019t try to find blame. \u2026 I have been sick for a very long time and didn\u2019t take care of me.\u201d\n\nTo me, she wrote: \u201cI can never make things right & no matter what I say or do you will never believe me. Maybe now you can get on with living. You have so much to live for and your family needs you. I do too. \u2026 Be kind to yourself. Love mom.\u201d\n\nShow caption Hide caption I asked each of my children to read this story before I could share it with USA TODAY. They each were sweet, pointing out a... I asked each of my children to read this story before I could share it with USA TODAY. They each were sweet, pointing out a missing word, asking for a new ending (I obliged) and saying they were proud that I did it. It's hard to get all four of them in a photo. This was taken on Mother's Day of 2018. From left: Lucy, Luke, Theo and Henry. Courtesy of Laura Trujillo\n\nThe arc of time\n\nMy kids have learned in their own ways to try to understand how their grandmother ended her life, as well as how she lived it. Henry, my oldest who even as a teenager would drop everything he was doing when my mom would stop by, smiles when he talks about her. Now a college junior, he still has a wallet-sized card she made for him when we moved, a photo of her yellow Lab on it and a handwritten note, \u201cAlways remember, Grandma loves you. Call me any time.\u201d\n\nTheo, who was just old enough to understand how she died, is now a high school senior and the one who sometimes shares stories about her that even I don\u2019t know: how she made chocolate chip cookie bowls for ice cream when he stayed the night at her house, or read \"The Hunger Games\" along with him when he was little, worried he might need someone to ask questions.\n\nLuke still doesn\u2019t talk much about her, but as he learned to drive this past summer, he teased me that I drive exactly like my mom: slow and deliberate, with the radio turned down, and I say the exact phrase she would say to me: \u201cDrive carefully. You have precious cargo.\u201d\n\nLucy talks about her frequently with a deep sense of closeness or connection that can surprise me now that my mom has been gone longer than she was here for Lucy. When I opened Lucy\u2019s locket, it had a photo of herself in it, which made me laugh. Until I saw that the photo on the other side was my mother. She always wanted them to be next to each other.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThere are days in the years since my mom killed herself that it has felt as if the canyon was everywhere: An OmniMax theater, a school assignment on national parks, vacation photos on Facebook and on the nightly news. Suicide, it seems, also is everywhere: A friend\u2019s son took his own life, as did the mother of a former co-worker. A friend shot and killed himself. Another friend told me his mother had killed herself when he was just 12, and for 40 years he has never told anyone but his wife. One celebrity after another dies by suicide, their faces dotting the news.\n\nCOLUMN: Media coverage of suicide must go beyond celebrities\n\nI have read and re-read the last text that my mom sent that morning, the one that said her eight grandchildren had been the joy of her life. \u201cI will miss you and seeing you grow to be beautiful adults. I\u2019m so sorry I disappointed all of you, in my heart I know this is not right, but it's all I can do. Pray for my soul.\u201d\n\nI have spread her ashes in many places she loved, from the highest hills in Corsica to this very spot at the Grand Canyon.\n\nAnd on a late summer night this year, after I walked the 197 steps from the shuttle bus stop to the point at which my mother jumped, after I learned every detail down to the height of the railing, I returned to the canyon with my daughter.\n\nOn a night without moonlight, you can just see a blanket of stars, more stars than sky it seems. At night the canyon is just a deep, dark hole, and in some ways it feels more impressive than in daylight, the emptiness of it all.\n\nJust as the canyon is so unknowable that geologists and scientists can study it, but will never know exactly how it began, the same is true about my mom. I\u2019m figuring out how to be OK with that.\n\nShow caption Hide caption In the end, I thought I was finally at peace with my mom's suicide. But it wasn't until I returned to the canyon in August... In the end, I thought I was finally at peace with my mom's suicide. But it wasn't until I returned to the canyon in August of this year, this time with Lucy, to see the beauty and quiet, that I truly realized that I'm OK. Kelley French / For the USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nI think of her that morning, walking to the ledge. Did she see the blush of the sky as the sun rose, casting the north wall of the canyon in gold and leaving the south in blue? Did she hear the hooves of the mules as they carried visitors to the bottom? Did she climb over the fence or go around it? Did she see how the juniper attaches to the rock, because that\u2019s in the nature of all living things \u2013 to cling to life and to the earth as if everything depended on it? Did she walk out onto that high limestone boulder? Did she sit for a while and take it all in? Did she cry?\n\nThe truth is that the timeline says she didn\u2019t make time for that. She was here, and she was gone.\n\nAnd so I bring my daughter to this place, not to see where my mom ended her life, not because I think I\u2019ll find an answer, but to show her the beauty and the quiet, the arc of time, the way something as immutable as rock looks completely different in the shifting light, to witness the grand design of the world, to feel the forces older and stronger than the earth itself, and to accept the vastness of the things we cannot know.\n\nLaura Trujillo and her husband and four children live in Ohio.
