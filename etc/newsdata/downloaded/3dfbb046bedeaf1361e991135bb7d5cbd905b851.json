Think about it\u2026 \u2014 Ellen Barkin (@EllenBarkin) October 6, 2019\n\nSure, Ellen, we\u2019re the dumb ones.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people like her read lines someone else wrote for a living.\n\nShe continued \u2026\n\nThe dude can\u2019t spell. I\u2019m not talking about big words like compulsory or obligatory but a single syllable word\u2026moat. He spells it \u201cmoot\u201d. But moot is already a ward. With a very different meaning. Can you see how something like this could crate a dangerous situation? \u2014 Ellen Barkin (@EllenBarkin) October 6, 2019\n\nCrate.\n\n*sigh*\n\nAnd Ellen thinks Trump supporters are the dumb ones. K.\n\nCreate. Crate. Get it? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Ellen Barkin (@EllenBarkin) October 6, 2019\n\nYeah, she TOTALLY meant to do that.\n\nOh, and \u2018ward\u2019.\n\nTotally.\n\nWhat a hyena.\n\nYou obviously havent been burned by autocorrect. Lucky you. \u2014 Blueskies (@blueskies6123) October 8, 2019\n\nWe have you criticizing someone's spelling to prove they are dumb and his voters are clearly dumb. Then you say \"moot\" is a ward, not word. Then spell create as \"crate\". I love a self-own. Yours was delightful! \u2014 Terry O' (@IrishTea1) October 8, 2019\n\nThank you for making the year 2020 the year for Trump. calling Americans dumb is just one more step closer to make President @realDonaldTrump president of the US for another 4 years. God bless you. \u2014 Xaser Nixeus (@XaserNixeus) October 8, 2019\n\nEllen must really want four more years of this.\n\nWhat\u2019s a cuz? Is that your mothers sisters child? \u2014 StasheMc'Stashe (@JMHaircut) October 8, 2019\n\nWe do believe this is called a self-own, although Ellen will likely claim she did this on purpose to make some point about spelling errors. And hey, let\u2019s go with that line of reasoning as well \u2013 being as stupid as the guy she just called stupid proves a point how?\n\nYeah, fail. So much fail.\n\nRelated:\n\nComplete and TOTAL coward: Clay Travis DROPS Warriors coach Steve Kerr for conveniently having NO COMMENT on NBA/China\n\nNothing to see HERE \u2013> Comey\u2019s FBI spokesman took \u2018monetary gifts\u2019 from CNN reporter (then lied about it under oath)\n\n\u2018Go reread ORWELL\u2019: Kimberley Strassel nails Dems/media about the terrible precedent they set under Obama and it\u2019s PERFECT", "description": "And Ellen thinks Trump supporters are the dumb ones.
