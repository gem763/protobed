REUTERS/Tom Kirkwood/File Photo\n\nDAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania has flown in nine black rhinos to its Serengeti national park from South Africa as part of efforts to restore its population of the critically endangered species.\n\nRampant poaching during the 1960s and 1970s in the Serengeti, famed for its sweeping planes and Africa\u2019s most spectacular wildebeest migration, devastated the population of rare east African black rhinos in Tanzania.\n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) estimates there were only 133 left in Tanzania by 2015.\n\nRhinoceros are hunted and killed by poachers for their horn which is prized in parts of Asia, where it is thought to have medicinal properties.\n\n\u201cThe arrival of the nine black rhinos is in line with the government\u2019s conservation plans that aim to increase the number ... in their natural habitats,\u201d Tanzania\u2019s deputy natural resources and tourism minister, Constantine Kanyasu, said.\n\nThe rhinos, which arrived on Tuesday, were donated by the Grumeti Fund, a non-profit organisation carrying out wildlife conservation in the Serengeti, Kanyasu told Reuters.\n\nThis is not the first time rhinos have been brought to Tanzania from South Africa. Conservationists flew five black rhinos to the Serengeti park in May 2010.\n\nTanzania\u2019s presidency said in July that the country\u2019s elephant and rhino populations have begun to rebound after a government crackdown dismantled organised criminal networks involved in industrial-scale poaching.", "description": "Tanzania has flown in nine\u00a0black rhinos to its Serengeti national park from South Africa as part of efforts to restore its population of the critically endangered species.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429038644&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0TV", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
