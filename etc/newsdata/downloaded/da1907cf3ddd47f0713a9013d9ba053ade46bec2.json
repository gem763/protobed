The financial consultant is one of 350 volunteers working on an ambitious new project in Monmouthshire, which could soon become Britain's blueprint to end an epidemic of loneliness.\n\nHarkness started volunteering two years ago, when he scaled back his work and wanted to find out more about Monmouth and the people who live in his town.\n\n\"I was away from home a lot and I didn\u2019t have a lot of contact with my community. When I scaled that back I had time and I wanted to get in touch with where I live,\" he explains.\n\n\"I was driving 60,000 miles a year. Now I drive people to things like lunch clubs or physio sessions.\"\n\nHe is part of a community of volunteers trialing artificial intelligence technology designed to match lonely people with others with similar interests and encourage them to do activities together.\n\nThis radical project aims to help people who feel isolated because they can no longer drive or rely on relatives, to run errands or to participate in activities they enjoy with friends and acquaintances.\n\nTheir work could make a big difference in the battle to reduce the 1.5 million people in the UK aged 50 and over who the Office of National Statistics claims suffer from \u201cchronic loneliness\u201d.", "description": "\"I've had all kinds of people in my car, from millionaires to people on pension credits,\" Patrick Harkness laughs.", "authors": ["Natasha Bernal", "Tom Hoggins", "Harry De Quetteville"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000168895292-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
