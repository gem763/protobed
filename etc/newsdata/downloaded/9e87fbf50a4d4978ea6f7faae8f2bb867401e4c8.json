(There\u2019s a reason the series opens with a re-creation of the Tulsa Race Massacre.) Rorschach, for one, has become a fabled hero and mascot for a sect of white supremacists called the Seventh Kalvary; they\u2019re on the rise, and the masked police force of Tulsa, Oklahoma, is on the case. Regina King leads as detective Angela Abar, a.k.a. Sister Knight.\n\nSo where does Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s 1943 musical Oklahoma! fit in? Well, we already know from the current Circle in the Square Theatre production, i.e., Sexy Oklahoma!, that not everything was O.K. while the titular state was being settled. The cheery, patriotic tale of romance and westward expansion tends to gloss over the whole genocide and displacement thing. Watchmen has comparable social commentary on its mind.\n\nIn the premiere episode, moments after a black police officer is shot dead in his patrol car by a member of the Seventh Kalvary, Sheriff Judd Crawford (played by Don Johnson) is shown with his wife sitting in the orchestra at an all-black production of Oklahoma! The staging of Black Oklahoma!, as it\u2019s teasingly called for the rest of the episode, is a nod to the series\u2019 setting, yes, but when asked about it at New York Comic Con earlier this month, Lindelof (a secret musical-theater nerd, it turns out) explained that there\u2019s more at play here.\n\n\u201cMy father was a big fan of Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, and he would bring me into the city and they would show them at the Ziegfeld [Theatre] with a live orchestra,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo we saw The King & I and South Pacific and Oklahoma!, and I was just completely and totally mesmerized. And it just felt like we wanted to make a real counterpoint between Oklahoma! the movie \u2014 where it\u2019s sort of like, \u2018Look at all these people singing and dancing and how wonderful Oklahoma is now that we\u2019ve gotten rid of all the Native Americans. Let\u2019s make it a state!\u2019 \u2014 versus what really happened in Oklahoma, which we\u2019re starting to uncover on the show.\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s just hope Lindelof\u2019s musical-theater love has rubbed off on King \u2014 the Oscar and Emmy winner could use a Tony on her way to EGOT!", "description": "In episode one of the HBO series, Don Johnson\u2019s character watches an all-black production of Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s musical \u2018Oklahoma!\u2019 Creator Damon Lindelof explains why this moment is more than a nod to the series\u2019 setting.", "authors": ["Benjamin Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/watchmen/watchmen-oklahoma.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
