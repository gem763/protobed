Buck \u201chas no regard for human life,\u201d the motion said.\n\nIn addition to operating a drug house, Buck is charged with furnishing methamphetamine and with battery causing serious bodily injury. He was scheduled for arraignment on Wednesday. Messages to his attorney, Seymour Amster, were not immediately returned.\n\nBuck, 65, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to California candidates, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, and is well known in LGBTQ political circles.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It was the second such death in two years, following the July 2017 death of Gemmel Moore, 26. Both men were black. Buck, who is white, was not charged and critics later questioned if wealth, race or political ties influenced the investigation.\n\nThe investigation into those deaths continues, county district attorney\u2019s spokesman Greg Risling said.\n\nBuck\u2019s attorney had said Dean came to Buck\u2019s home under the influence and didn\u2019t ingest any drugs while there. In their bail motion, however, prosecutors specifically blamed Buck\u2019s actions for the two deaths and they alleged he personally gave a dangerous dose of methamphetamine to a man who survived an overdose earlier this month.\n\nOn Sept. 11, the man returned and Buck injected him with two more dangerous doses, refused to help him and \u201cthwarted\u201d his efforts to get help until the man fled the apartment and called 911 from a gas station, prosecutors alleged. \u201cHis deadly behavior has not stopped,\u201d prosecutors contended.\n\nBuck\u2019s \u201cpredatory acts and willful disregard for human life must be stopped before another life is lost,\u201d their motion read.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Prosecutors describe Edward Buck, a prominent Calif.
