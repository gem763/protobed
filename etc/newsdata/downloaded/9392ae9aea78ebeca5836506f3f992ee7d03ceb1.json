But from the 1920s until 1959 it was, and the white Art Deco building that remains today is now a treasure trove of aviation nerdery.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

In its first year, it saw 2,000 passengers depart from its grassy airfield, with royals and world dignitaries arriving in limousines from Victoria Station or in chauffeured vehicles direct from their luxury homes and hotels.\n\nFlying was hardly glamorous back then. Planes had wicker chairs that weren\u2019t even bolted to the floor, there was no pressurisation in the cabin, and the toilet would have been a bucket behind a curtain. The pilot sat outside in an uncovered cockpit, and the planes would have to fly through the weather rather than above it. In short, it was noisy, bumpy and wildly uncomfortable.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In fact, the entire concept of air traffic control was developed here, and many of the protocols still used today were invented in Croydon. The mayday distress call (from the French \u201cm\u2019aidez\u201d, which means \u201chelp me\u201d) was coined by Croydon\u2019s own Stanley Mockford.\n\nWithout the use of radio, air traffic controllers would communicate with pilots waiting to taxi by hanging painted signs over the balcony of the control tower. If the sign had your airline\u2019s initials on it, it was time to head to the runway. When it was finally safe for take-off, an enormous bright lamp was shone in the direction of the plane to indicate their turn. A crude method by today\u2019s standards, this was revolutionary for the industry at the time.\n\nBy 1935, passenger numbers had increased drastically and as many as 130,000 people were departing from Croydon annually, flying to destinations all over the British empire from southern Africa to the far reaches of Australia. The world\u2019s longest international flight was launched here, too. You could fly from London to Brisbane in two weeks, stopping in locations like the United Arab Emirates for luxurious desert-based dinners and fabulous overnight stays.\n\nFlying became more glamorous over the years, with the invention of purpose-built airliner seats and the launch of Imperial Airways\u2019 Silver Wings service, which involved a three-course, silver-service dinner on the Croydon to Paris route. The airport really was the centre of the British empire, and became a hub for the likes of KLM, Air France and even Lufthansa (up until the first day of the Second World War).\n\nNumerous celebrities flew from here, too, with Rita Hayworth, Charlie Chaplain and politicians like John F Kennedy among many on the passenger lists. Even famous pilots came through Croydon. Charles Lindberg stopped off here after completing the first ever solo flight from the US to Europe. It ended in Paris but he detoured to Croydon on the way back to meet crowds of over 100,000 people lining the streets and waving from the airport\u2019s spectators gallery on the rooftop. It was the biggest reception for an aircraft until The Beatles landed at Heathrow in 1963.\n\nNow-famous aviatrix Amy Johnson took off from Croydon in 1930 as a nobody, but by the time she landed back here after her record-breaking flight to Australia she too was greeted by hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe airport\u2019s heyday was short-lived, sadly, as the creation of Heathrow took away most of the international air traffic from 1946. Croydon played second fiddle to the new airport and eventually closed its doors in 1959, so today most of its property has been sold off and turned into an industrial estate, and the Grade II-listed departures building is now an office block.\n\nCome the first Sunday of every month, though, you can relive the golden age of air travel with volunteer guides from the Croydon Airport Society, who\u2019ll show you around the old departures hall and take you up to the air traffic control tower where original equipment has been preserved. If that\u2019s not a good reason to hang around a Croydon industrial estate, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nCroydon Airport is open to visitors every first Sunday of the month; it\u2019s free to enter but donations are welcome.", "description": "I don\u2019t make a habit of hanging around on industrial estates in Croydon.
