They stopped and searched a number of young people dressed in black.\n\nThe crowds chanted \u201cBlack cop! Black cop!\u201d as they saw riot police. At about 2.20pm, before the march was due to start, officers fired several rounds of teargas at crowds congregating in front of the Sogo department store. Police had earlier subdued several protesters and angered the crowds.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protester throws a petrol bomb during the unrest in Causeway Bay.

Riot police later fired rounds of teargas at protesters outside an upmarket shopping centre in Admiralty and near the government headquarters. They also used water cannon to spray protesters with water mixed with blue dye and stinging chemicals.\n\nDozens of protesters were arrested after being chased by police, with many tackled to the ground and some left bleeding heavily. A number of protesters were also made to line up against the wall on the main road.\n\nAs activists retreated from Admiralty, some made makeshift barricades and set them ablaze. Street fires were also started in the Wan Chai district in an attempt to stop the police from approaching.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riot police move in outside Wan Chai station.

It also said undercover police wearing black clothing typical of protesters were seen retreating into the station with the help of uniformed officers. Police have admitted sending officers disguised as protesters to carry out operations during demonstrations.\n\nA young man in full protective gear said: \u201cI don\u2019t want violence either, but the authorities are using hardline measures against us, so I\u2019m fighting against them with my life.\u201d\n\nAfter dark, more clashes took place and police again fired multiple rounds of teargas. Large groups of riot police encroached on a diminishing group of protesters in Causeway Bay after a water cannon put out fires.\n\nDozens of protesters marched towards a large group of riot police, prompting officers to deploy teargas.\n\nLater in the evening, police left the scene in vans as protesters jeered at them. Some activists threw sticks and bricks and a police vehicle stopped to fire two rounds of teargas. More teargas was fired late at night in Wan Chai, local media reported.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters take cover using umbrellas as police use teargas.

Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.\n\nProtesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our next generation to lose our freedoms. We don\u2019t accept one country, one system.\u201d This was a reference to China\u2019s agreement to give Hong Kong semi-autonomy \u2013 \u201cone country, two systems\u201d \u2013 after taking control of the city back from the UK in 1997.\n\nMany shops in the area closed. Protesters spray-painted a closed Starbucks cafe in Wan Chai with messages calling on people to boycott it. The company that runs the cafe chain in Hong Kong is seen by protesters as being pro-Beijing.\n\nYoung protesters wearing black were digging up paving stones at a crossroads in Wan Chai while others smashed glass panels at a metro exit of Wan Chai station, which has been closed. The outer walls of the exit were also spray-painted with anti-police messages and \u201cFree HK\u201d, \u201cReclaim HK, revolution of our era\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters dug up paving stones in Wan Chai.
