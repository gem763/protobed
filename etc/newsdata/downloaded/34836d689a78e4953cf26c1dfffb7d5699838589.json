Limpopo and the Northern Cape saw big jumps in the number of carjackings reported, 27.2% and 27.6% respectively.\n\nIn the most dangerous provinces by Naked's calculations, meanwhile, hijackings decreased. In KwaZulu-Natal the decline was bigger than in any other province at 10.9%, and in Gauteng there were 4% fewer hijackings than in the year before.\n\nA police analysis of a subset of the hijackings reported last year showed that nearly half of all incidents took place in townships, and another big chunk of hijackings took place in suburbs. Only 5.5% of all hijackings took place outside built-up areas \u2013 of which the Northern Cape has very few, and Limpopo has relatively few.\n\nThe police statistics suggest that the newer and more expensive cars to be found in economic powerhouse provinces such as Gauteng have little to do with the their higher rates of hijacking.\n\nDocket analysis showed that 31.1% of hijacked cars were at least 10 years old, and two thirds of hijacked vehicles were worth less than R200,000.\n\n\"The older model vehicles are often hijacked for spare parts or used as local taxis operating within townships,\" the SAPS said in its analysis.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Analysis by an insurance company shows the probability of being hijacked or having your car stolen remains lowest in two provinces that saw spikes of more than 27% in carjackings last year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4085/9b1f32f221b84b84835118ee1084ee74.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
