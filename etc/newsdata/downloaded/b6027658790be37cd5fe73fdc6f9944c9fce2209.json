The league\u2019s rules prohibit players from wearing uniforms bearing slogans during official games, though they can sport them during practices and off-field events, according to WPTZ-TV.\n\nAt the Burlington game, the crowd cheered and chanted \u201cequal pay\u201d when the girls revealed the jerseys, more than 500 of which the team had already sold as part of a fundraising campaign.\n\nThe team\u2019s coach told Good Morning America that the girls were inspired by the World Cup-winning U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team, whose players are vocal advocates for closing the gender pay gap, specifically in professional soccer leagues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appalling, and it\u2019s ridiculous that that\u2019s still a thing,\u201d Burlington varsity soccer player Maggie Barlow told WPTZ-TV.\n\nThe team has sold the #EqualPay jerseys to other students, high school athletes and even Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and his wife. The Nike jerseys cost $25 \u2014 though male buyers were encouraged to pay 16% more to mark the average gender pay disparity in Vermont, according to the Free Press.\n\nThe school\u2019s boys soccer team wore the jerseys in solidarity with the girls team at a recent game, but the Free Press reported that they managed to avoid yellow cards by lifting up their jerseys without taking them off.\n\nThe money raised from jersey sales will reportedly go toward diversifying girls\u2019 youth soccer in Burlington.", "description": "The Vermont teenagers said they were inspired by the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team to advocate for closing the gender pay gap.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daccfcc210000e31dad3584.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
