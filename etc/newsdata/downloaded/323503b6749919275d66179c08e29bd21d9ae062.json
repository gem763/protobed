But Liu still kept very much his character, the Chinese character.\"\n\nCimarelli, who had lived in China for many years, said the exhibition is an excellent platform for American audience to learn more about the real Chinese culture.\n\nThe exhibition marks the first leg of a world tour of Liu's works, which is organized by the Central Academy of Fine Arts where Liu graduated and lectured.\n\nThe exhibition will also be shown in ACC's Washington D.C. branch on Nov. 14-26. Then it will travel to Boston, Los Angeles, Sydney and Melbourne in 2020.", "description": "An exhibition of late Chinese sculptor Liu Shiming's works was launched at the Asian Cultural Center (ACC) in here on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db8dcc9a310cf3e97a37beb.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
