Later, the agent returns and allows her inside.\n\nThe interaction intensifies later in the episode, \u201cThe World Is Watching,\u201d when Kansas City lawyer Andrea Martinez exits the center on a stretcher with a fractured foot and lacerations on her knee and leg. Because Netflix cameras weren\u2019t allowed inside, viewers don\u2019t see what transpired with Martinez inside the center, as she tried to assist her 3-year-old client in reuniting with his detained mother so they could both be deported to Honduras.\n\nA lawsuit filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court, Western District of Missouri fills in those blanks. Martinez, who is represented by ACLU of Missouri Foundation, is suing the U.S. government for \u201cexcessive force\u201d and \u201cunlawful search and seizure\u201d in violation of the Fourth Amendment, as well as two ICE agents, Everett Chase and Ronnet Sasse, for \u201cassault, battery, false arrest, false imprisonment and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is about standing up to ICE, not only for myself being personally bullied, but because if I didn\u2019t sue, ICE would just get away with it,\u201d Martinez told Vulture. \u201cAnd they get away with too much as it is. They hurt people. They abuse immigrants. They mistreat immigrants, and they just expect they\u2019re not going to be sued because immigrants are vulnerable and they\u2019re probably going to get deported before there\u2019s ever a lawsuit able to be filed. We tell our children to stand up to bullies, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing through this lawsuit. My bully just happens to be the United States of America.\u201d\n\nOn June 26, 2018, Martinez and attorney Megan Galicia escorted Noah, the boy, and his stepfather, Luis Diaz, to the center to meet with Kenia, who was five months pregnant and had been detained for nearly two months. The handoff was supposed to take place around 3:30 a.m. in the parking lot, where there were about three dozen protesters and Netflix\u2019s documentary crew waiting. But when they arrived, the ICE agents told the lawyers that Luis would need to bring the boy inside because of light rain. Although an ICE officer had previously told the lawyers that Luis Diaz, who is undocumented, would not be detained during the transaction, Martinez and Galicia worried he would be if they forced him inside.\n\nIn the documentary, after Martinez is pushed to the ground, she gets up on her own and eventually Chase allows her inside, but leaves Galicia outside. Although Martinez and Luis were wired for sound, Netflix did not air everything that transpired in the 30 to 45 minutes that Martinez was inside with Luis. In the documentary, viewers hear some of Luis and Kenia\u2019s emotional reunion and farewell, but the documentary doesn\u2019t show how, according to Martinez, Chase prevented her from retrieving Kenia\u2019s luggage from the car and how Chase responded to her injuries as her foot swelled and she discovered she was bleeding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to watch yourself [on the documentary] pop back up and have no idea that you have a broken foot,\u201d Martinez told Vulture. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in lawyer mode and you\u2019re representing a 3-year-old who just got forcibly separated, the attorney comes on and you\u2019re just concerned about Noah. There were so many things happening at once.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, after Kenia and Noah were taken away, Officer Chase called Federal Protective Services to arrest Martinez for trying to forcibly enter the building. Martinez told Vulture she tried to call police on her own, but Chase took her phone away and tried to access her passcode but failed. \u201cI realized he was trying to have me arrested, and we just had this awkward time where it\u2019s silent and I notice that my foot is throbbing and I\u2019m bleeding from my left knee and ankle,\u201d Martinez told Vulture. \u201cI told him I need medical assistance and he looks at my leg and goes, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not severe enough.\u2019\u201d\n\nEventually, Martinez says, Chase gave her her phone and an ice pack for her foot, but left her locked inside a conference room with Luis. When Chase exited the room, Martinez called Galicia and asked her to call the police and an ambulance. As the lawyers feared, Luis was detained and remained so for two months.\n\nMartinez told Vulture that filing a lawsuit was the only recourse she had after the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Missouri declined to charge Chase, after reviewing an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and Office of Inspector General. Both Chase and Sasse remain in their jobs. \u201cI have determined that the evidence does not support the allegations made against the ICE-ERO officer, and have formally declined to file charges for actions taken in the exercise of his official duties,\u201d U.S. Attorney Timothy A. Garrison stated in a January press release. \u201cIn light of circumstances created by more than 30 people who came to a routine law enforcement operation at 3 a.m. for the purpose of making a spectacle, the officer\u2019s actions were justified in order to secure and control access to the ICE office entrance from unauthorized persons.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit doesn\u2019t ask for a specific remedy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let the court make that determination,\u201d Martinez told Vulture. \u201cWe really believe that this is a matter of principle and it\u2019s a matter of not letting ICE agents get away with hurting people and making sure these individuals are held responsible. My opinion differs from the U.S. Attorney. People have a right to peacefully protest in public spaces, and there\u2019s no excuse for violence on the part of law enforcement just because they don\u2019t know what to do when they\u2019re being filmed.\u201d", "description": "Following a June incident shown in the Netflix docuseries, Missouri lawyer Andrea Martinez is suing the U.S. government and ICE agents for excessive force, unlawful search and seizure, and false imprisonment.", "authors": ["Maria Elena Fernandez"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/10/10-living-undocumented-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
