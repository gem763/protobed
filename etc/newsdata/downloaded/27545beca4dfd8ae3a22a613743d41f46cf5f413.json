Movies that play on Chinese screens must be approved by Beijing, which remains hypersensitive to any content that might portray the country in anything less than a positive light.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company has altered characters in its Marvel movie universe to avoid offending Beijing. The Disney-owned ESPN recently forbade its journalists from discussing the relationship between China and Hong Kong, after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement.\n\nApple recently removed an app used by Hong Kong protestors to track police activity from the iPhone app store following criticism from communist China.\n\nApple TV+ is set to launch in November and will compete with the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and the upcoming Disney+ streaming service.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
