But it has to be in some special place to give us all the scattering that we see.'\n\nWHAT ARE FAST RADIO BURSTS AND WHY DO WE STUDY THEM? Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are radio emissions that appear temporarily and randomly, making them not only hard to find, but also hard to study. The mystery stems from the fact it is not known what could produce such a short and sharp burst. This has led some to speculate they could be anything from stars colliding to artificially created messages. Scientists searching for fast radio bursts (FRBs) that some believe may be signals sent from aliens may be happening every second. The blue points in this artist's impression of the filamentary structure of galaxies are signals from FRBs The first FRB was spotted, or rather 'heard' by radio telescopes, back in 2001 but wasn't discovered until 2007 when scientists were analysing archival data. But it was so temporary and seemingly random that it took years for astronomers to agree it wasn't a glitch in one of the telescope's instruments. Researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics point out that FRBs can be used to study the structure and evolution of the universe whether or not their origin is fully understood. A large population of faraway FRBs could act as probes of material across gigantic distances. This intervening material blurs the signal from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the left over radiation from the Big Bang. A careful study of this intervening material should give an improved understanding of basic cosmic constituents, such as the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter and dark energy, which affect how rapidly the universe is expanding. FRBs can also be used to trace what broke down the 'fog' of hydrogen atoms that pervaded the early universe into free electrons and protons, when temperatures cooled down after the Big Bang.\n\nThe new FRBs are are also at unusually low radio frequencies.\n\nMost previously detected FRBs have had frequencies of around 1,400 megahertz (MHz), but the new ones fell within a range below 800 MHz.\n\nIn 2017 Professor Loeb and Harvard colleague Manasvi Lingham proposed that FRBs could be leakage from planet-sized alien transmitters.\n\nMysterious radio signals (artist's impression) have reached Earth - from a galaxy 1.5 billion light years away. The strange beams are known as fast radio bursts (FRBs) - and last only a millisecond (file image)\n\nRather than being designed for communication, they would more likely be used to propel giant space ships powered by light sails.\n\nA light sail works by bouncing light, or in this case radio beams, off a huge reflective sheet to provide forward thrust.\n\nProfessor Loeb, who discusses the idea in a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said: 'An artificial origin is worth contemplating and checking.'", "description": "Experts from British Columbia University in Canada believe they are likely to be caused by the left overs of an exploding star - or supernova - or a a supermassive black hole.", "authors": ["Tim Collins For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/10/09/8349820-0-image-a-2_1547112567587.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-09"}
