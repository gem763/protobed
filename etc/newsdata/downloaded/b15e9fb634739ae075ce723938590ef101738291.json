Indian authorities imposed a sweeping military curfew and cut off residents from all communications and the internet.\n\n\u201cFor 50 days, the people of Kashmir have been locked down by 900,000 soldiers,\u201d Khan said, describing mass arrests, non-functioning hospitals and \u201ca total news blackout\u201d in the region.\n\n\u201cEight million people in an open jail is unprecedented in this day and age,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThe biggest worry is what happens once the curfew is lifted? We fear with 900,000 soldiers there, there will be a massacre.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The region is one of the most heavily militarized in the world, patrolled by soldiers and paramilitary police. Most Kashmiris resent the Indian troop presence. Modi has defended the Kashmir changes as freeing the territory from separatism, and his supporters welcomed the move.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said after an earlier meeting with Khan that it would be great if Modi and Khan can resolve their standoff over Kashmir.\n\nBut while Khan said he has raised Kashmir with world leaders this week, he expressed no interest in meeting with Modi.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately India today is governed by a racist, a Hindu supremacist,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThey do not consider Muslims as equal citizens\u201d\n\nIndian U.N. Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin indicated in a recent interview that a meeting between Modi and Khan was unlikely: \u201cThere has to be an enabling environment before leaders meet.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday the talk that is emanating from Pakistan in certainly not conducive to that enabling environment,\u201d he said.\n\nKhan also addressed claims by India\u2019s army chief, Gen. Bipin Rawat, that Pakistan has reactivated militant camps in Pakistan-held Kashmir and about 500 militants are waiting to infiltrate India. He didn\u2019t provide any evidence to back his claims.\n\nKhan called the claims \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat possible benefit is Pakistan going to have now sending in terrorists when there are 900,000 security forces there? All that would happen is that there would be more oppression on the people of Kashmir,\u201d he said.\n\nKhan also said that he had begun, at the request of the U.S. president, to mediate between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani over a nuclear standoff. He provided no other details but said he had spoken to Rouhani on Monday after Trump asked Khan to \u201cdeescalate the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are trying our best,\u201d he said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Imran Khan has warned of possible war between Pakistan and India over what he called a brutal Indian crackdown in Kashmir.", "authors": ["Foster Klug"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/pakistan-imran-khan-india-war-kashmir.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C132px%2C5184px%2C2713px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
