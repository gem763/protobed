Thus, cryptoassets have served more as a highly speculative asset class for certain investors and those engaged in illicit activities rather than as a means to make payments.\u201d\n\nStablecoin taxonomy \u2013 defined as a money equivalent, contractual or property claim, or right against an issuer for an asset \u2013 will remain a preeminent legal question for the time being, the report continues. The effects of stablecoins on incumbent money systems such as wire transfers have yet to be fully understood as well.\n\nWhile stablecoins may offer faster, cheaper and more inclusive payments, they can \u201conly be realized if significant risks are addressed.\u201d\n\nIn a footnote, the G7 report says the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority\u2019s (FINMA) handling of the Libra Association, which falls under the regulator\u2019s purview in Geneva, agrees with the G7\u2019s stablecoin recommendations.\n\nFINMA recently said Libra highlights the need for international coordination and \u201cappropriate prudential requirements\u201d for all services offered over that of a payment system.\n\nThe report on stablecoins was prepared at the request of the G7 in July, soon after the launch of Libra back in June.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoin-image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
