But one must accept many, if not all, of Thompson\u2019s premises to defend Trump against accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nNow think of what it means to accept those premises: that there would be nothing wrong with the next Democratic president taking identical actions in turn.\n\nDefenders of Trump on this matter would seem to be conceding that a President Kamala Harris could pressure foreign leaders to investigate Don Jr., Eric, and Ivanka Trump for corrupt business dealings in their respective countries, marshaling the leverage of U.S. foreign policy to secure answers.\n\nThe inquiry could extend to anything related, however tangentially, to the official doings and responsibilities of their father, which would plausibly encompass nearly all of the Trump Organization\u2019s actions around the world.\n\nHarris could run the whole operation through a personal attorney chosen for his or her personal and political loyalty, bypassing the procedures and checks against corruption embedded within the federal bureaucracy. And she could do this to the Trump kids even if one of them were running against her for president\u2013\u2013indeed, it would not even matter if her motives were obviously venal.\n\nSo, Trump supporters: Do you think, as I do, that it would be an abuse of power for President Harris to investigate Don Jr., Eric, and Ivanka in this fashion? Or are you okay with the precedent that Trump is trying to set?", "description": "Defenders of Trump would seem to be conceding that a President Kamala Harris could pressure foreign leaders to investigate Don Jr., Eric, and Ivanka Trump for corrupt business dealings.", "authors": ["Conor Friedersdorf", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_060411026507/facebook.jpg?1569939718", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
