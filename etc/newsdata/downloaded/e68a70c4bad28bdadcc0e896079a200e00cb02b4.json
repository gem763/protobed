Monday is the stock\u2019s second day of trading after it was removed from the NSE index.\n\nThe wider Nifty private banks index lost 1.9%.\n\nShares in private-sector lender Yes Bank fell 9.7%. The bank said it had received approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to increase its authorised share capital in order to raise funds.\n\nThe market was being indecisive due to a lack of significant catalysts or drivers, said Kunj Bansal, chief investment officer at Acepro Advisors in Mumbai. \u201cOne of the factors which will help the market break out of its current range will be the earnings season.\u201d\n\nEarnings announcements for the quarter ended September are scheduled to begin from next week.\n\nThe Nifty metals index fell 2.5%.
