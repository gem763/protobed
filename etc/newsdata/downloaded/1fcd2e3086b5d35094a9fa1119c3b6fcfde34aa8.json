Australia will restrict access from Oct 26.\n\n\"This is our home,\" read a sign at the base of the rock. \"Please don't climb.\"\n\nSonita Vinecombe, visiting from Adelaide, lined up early in the morning to make the trek but said she had mixed feelings on the issue.\n\n\"You want to respect the cultural side of things, but still you want to have it as a challenge to get up the rock,\" she told Reuters.\n\nUsually most visitors do not climb Uluru's steep, red-ochre flanks, but the impending ban has triggered an upsurge in climbers. In early October, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park manager Mike Misso said that it has been the busiest time in more than a decade, with \u201cnear to 1,000\u201d people making the climb every day.\n\nAccording to the park 300,000 people visited Uluru in 2015, of whom 16.2 per cent climbed the rock - roughly 135 a day.", "description": "Hundreds of tourists flocked to Australia\u2019s Uluru on Friday to climb the world-famous red rock before a permanent ban comes into place.", "authors": ["Giovanni Torre", "Verity Bowman", "Emily Hill", "Nigel Farage", "John Longworth", "Tom Harris", "Asa Bennett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000214068467-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
