Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Florida Democrat, told reporters. \u201cThis filled in a lot of pieces of the puzzle.\u201d\n\nMs. Wasserman-Schultz, who was in the room for Mr. Taylor\u2019s opening remarks, and several other Democratic members said that disposition has been one of the most disturbing days in office for them.\n\nRep. Harley Rouda, California Democrat, said Mr. Taylor\u2019s opening statement drew \u201ca lot of sighs and gasps\u201d from the room.\n\n\u201cFrankly I\u2019m sad to see such a culture that enables corrupt behavior and too many people defending it,\u201d Rep. Dean Phillips, Minnesota Democrat, said.\n\nMr. Taylor, who appeared before lawmakers under a subpoena, became one of the most anticipated witnesses after text messages released by House Democrats after their meeting with former Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker showed him to be concerned about quid pro quo.\n\nIn the messages, Mr. Taylor openly objected to the administration\u2019s approach in Ukraine and told Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nMr. Sondland, who testified before lawmakers last week, denied in texts that there was no quid pro quo relating to the nearly $400 million in delayed military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI walk away with the impression Mr. Sondland is going to have some explaining to do,\u201d Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Illinois Democrat, said.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the president\u2019s top defenders on Capitol Hill and in the impeachment fight, did not say if there was any information in Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony that could exonerate the president, but did believe it would legitimize the issues involving Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s information that came out, particularly in this second hour, that underscores the concerns that the president had about Ukraine in general,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile at least one Democrat felt that Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony could be game changing for the impeachment inquiry, others were a bit more cautious in saying it could speed anything along.\n\n\u201cNone of us want to get ahead of ourselves. There\u2019s a lot more to learn,\u201d Ms. Wasserman-Schultz said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
