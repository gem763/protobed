Be very proud of yourselves Steelworker Joe Passmore, addressing fellow workers\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the mood was one of exhausted elation after workers were brought together to hear the news they had been hoping for.\n\nThere were huge smiles as the Save Our Shipyard banner was amended to We Saved Our Shipyard, cheers as the campaign chant was updated as well as hugs for union officials Susan Fitzgerald (Unite) and Denise Walker (GMB), who have been with them throughout.\n\nSteelworker Joe Passmore, one of the most prominent spokesmen for the workers, said they had been vindicated.\n\n\"We've created our own future, we've always known what the potential of this place is,\" he told workers.\n\n\"We always knew the skills that we had, and we always knew that given the chance the workforce of this place could make Harland and Wolff great again.\n\n\"So when we go back through those gates, that is exactly what we are going to do, we're going to show the world what we're capable of. Be very proud of yourselves because what we have achieved here is fantastic and I hope the world takes notice.\"\n\n190711090412619\n\nHe told the PA news agency that he hopes they will be back to work later this week.\n\n\"There are a lot of exhausted people here at the minute, but we're bouncing on adrenaline because the future we could have here could be brilliant and we're all looking forward to our beds, but we're really looking forward to what we believe could be a really successful future,\" he said.\n\n\"What we are hoping for is, we'll give everyone a rest and possibly Thursday [to be back at work] but we have got to confirm that yet.\n\n\"There's a few formalities to go through at the minute, but we had a good talk with the workforce in there and they know that the hard work really begins now and we are going to start as we mean to go on.\"\n\nSafeguarding employment\n\nFitzgerald, Unite's regional coordinating officer, said the occupation was proof that workers could win when they stand together, backed by their trade union.\n\n\"That's the message we want to go out to other workers, particularly the workers in Ballymena [Country Antrim] right now who are dealing with the closure at Wrightbus. We'll be going up this Friday en masse to support them,\" she said.\n\nWalker, a senior organiser with the GMB trade union, added: \"The victory today is payback for the nine weeks that the workers have sat out here. It's a vindication that they were right, they believed this yard had a future and they weren't prepared to stand by and let anybody come in and asset strip and mothball the yard, and these guys have worked hard to make sure there is a future not just for themselves, but for the skills that they bring for future generations still to come.\"\n\nThe shipyard, whose famous yellow cranes named Samson and Goliath dominate the east Belfast skyline, employed more than 30,000 people during the city's industrial heyday. But the workforce numbered only around 125 when the company went under.\n\nThe business had diversified away from shipbuilding in the past two decades, shifting to work on wind energy and marine engineering projects.\n\nKnown around the world for building the doomed White Star Line passenger ship Titanic, which sank on her maiden transatlantic voyage in 1912 after striking an iceberg, Harland and Wolff was one of the United Kingdom's key industrial producers during the World War II, supplying almost 150 warships.\n\nAdministrators BDO Northern Ireland confirmed they had entered into heads of terms with InfraStrata with the intent of completing the sale in the near future.\n\nA spokesman for BDO said: \"The agreed terms of sale will include the transfer of the remaining employees on their existing terms and conditions to the purchaser upon completion.\n\n\"In the interim, it is intended that the remaining employees will be able to return to work in the coming days to facilitate the remaining steps required for the completion of a sale.\n\n\"This is a very positive step towards securing a sale of the shipyard and protecting and safeguarding the employment of the workforce.\"", "description": "Workers' nine-week sit-in occupation pays off as Harland and Wolff rescued in buyout deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/ec479f2fb6a140bcaa3ae5b3ccbb426a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
