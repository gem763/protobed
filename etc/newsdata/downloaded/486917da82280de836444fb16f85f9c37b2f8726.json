Both Mr Stier and Mr Kavanaugh refused to discuss the allegation with the newspaper.\n\nThe Supreme Court Justice was sworn in last October despite testimony from Dr Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her while they were both at high school in 1982.\n\nMs Ford alleged that Mr Kavanaugh drunkenly forced her down onto a bed, groped her, attempted to remove her clothes, and held his hand over her mouth so that she could not scream for help.\n\nThe judge vehemently denied the claims during his own evidence to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nMr Kavanaugh was eventually confirmed in the Senate by a vote of 50 to 48 as protesters shouted \u201cShame!
