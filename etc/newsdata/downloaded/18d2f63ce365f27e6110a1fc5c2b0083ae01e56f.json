Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night\u2019s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run Medicare-for-all plan.\n\nAfter being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate at Otterbein University whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health care proposal, the progressive senator from Massachusetts didn\u2019t specifically answer, instead pledging that \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nDEMOCRATS UNITE IN IMPEACHING TRUMP AT TOP OF TUESDAY'S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON\n\nMoments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who\u2019s soared in polling in recent months and is now considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAccusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued that \u201cyour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything\u2014 except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d\n\nButtigieg then touted his plan for \u201cMedicare-for-all-who-want it,\u201d which, unlike the Medicare-for-all proposal championed by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would not eliminate private insurance.\n\nWarren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,' understand what that means: It\u2019s 'Medicare for all who can afford it.' And that\u2019s the problem we\u2019ve got. Medicare-for-all is the gold standard.\u201d\n\nBut Mayor Pete counterpunched: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years.\u201d\n\nSanders, who authored the Medicare-for-all bill in the Senate, chimed in, noting that \u201cas somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I say, let\u2019s be clear, under the Medicare-for-all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone.\"\n\n\n\nBut then he said \u201cit is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up\u201d before adding that \u201cfor virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d\n\nAsked again by the moderators if she would acknowledge what Sanders had just said, that middle-class taxes would rise, Warren answered, \u201cWhat I have committed to is that costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren.\n\nThe Minnesota Democrat said that \u201cat least Bernie\u2019s being honest here in saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up. And I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d", "description": "Facing increased scrutiny, Sen.
