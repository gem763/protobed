Elizabeth Warren is holding a slight edge over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for their party\u2019s 2020 nomination.\n\nThe poll \u2013 released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University \u2013 is the latest in a slew of national and early voting state surveys in recent weeks to show Warren has surged and now is virtually tied with Biden in the Democratic primary battle.\n\nSTAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE\n\nThe populist senator from Massachusetts who has produced one progressive plan after another stands at 29 percent support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the survey. Biden \u2013 who for months was the unrivaled front-runner \u2013 registers at 26 percent. Warren\u2019s three-point advantage over the former vice president is within the poll\u2019s margin of error.\n\n\u201cWarren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,\" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 the progressive independent from Vermont who\u2019s making his second straight White House run \u2013 received 16 percent support.\n\nWarren was at 27 percent, Biden 25 percent, and Sanders 16 percent in Quinnipiac's last Democratic primary poll, which was released two weeks ago.\n\nQUESTIONS MOUNT OVER WARREN'S STUMP SPEECH STORY THAT SHE LOST HER TEACHING JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a distant fourth, at 4 percent, in the new survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang stand at 3 percent in the survey. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota register at 2 percent, with everyone one else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates coming in at 1 percent or less.\n\nBiden tops President Trump 51-40 percent in a hypothetical general election matchup. But that\u2019s down from a 16 percentage point lead over the GOP president in Quinnipiac\u2019s late August poll. Warren\u2019s ahead of Trump by eight points in the new survey, down from a 12-point lead in August. And Sanders beat the president by 7 points, down from a 14 point lead in the previous poll.\n\nThe new poll also indicates that registered voters nationwide remain divided over impeaching and removing the president from office over the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nIMPEACHMENT INQUIRY GETS MAJORITY SUPPORT IN NEW POLL\n\nForty-five percent of registered voters say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 49 percent opposing such a move. Voters were evenly split at 47 percent in last week\u2019s Quinnipiac survey. But a Quinnipiac poll released late last month \u2013 before news of the Ukrainian crisis broke \u2013 indicated support for impeachment at just 37 percent.\n\nThe new poll indicates 53-43 percent majority support for impeachment inquiry being conducted the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, a slight uptick from 52-45 percent backing for the investigation a week ago.\n\nAs expected, there\u2019s a vast partisan divide, with 92 percent of Democrats saying the inquiry\u2019s legitimate and 88 percent of Republicans calling it a witch hunt. By a 52-40 percent margin, independents say the investigation into Trump is legitimate.\n\nTrump\u2019s under fire over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country that\u2019s been battling Russia this decade. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a read-out of the call released by the White House, Democrats argue the president was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nThe president and allies have instead tried to put the spotlight in the scandal on Biden, a political rival who\u2019s hoping to face off against the president in next year\u2019s election.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor \u2013 who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office \u2013 was later dismissed.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 4-7, with 1,483 self-identified registered voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey\u2019s overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percent for questions to the 646 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.", "description": "With one week to go until the next Democratic presidential debate, a new national poll indicates Sen.
