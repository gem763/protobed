Its model directly contrasts with Google\u2019s, which relies on pervasive tracking of Internet users to determine which ads to serve.\n\nBut there\u2019s plenty of evidence consumers hate being tracked. Not least the rise in use of tracker blockers.\n\n\u201cUsing the original design puzzle [i.e. that Google devised] we saw a lot of people selecting alternative search engines and we think it would go up from there,\u201d says Weinberg. \u201cBut even initially a 10% market share change is really significant.\u201d\n\nHe points to regulatory efforts in Europe and also Russia which have resulted in antitrust decisions and enforcements against Google \u2014 and where choice screens are already in use promoting alternative search engine choices to Android users.\n\nHe also notes that regulators in Australia and the UK are pursuing choice screens \u2014 as actual or potential remedies for rebalancing the search market.\n\nRussia has the lead here, with its regulator \u2014 the FAS \u2014 slapping Google with an order against bundling its services with Android all the way back in 2015, a few months after local search giant Yandex filed a complaint. A choice screen was implemented in 2017 and Russia\u2019s homegrown Internet giant has increased its search market share on Android devices as a result. Google continues to do well in Russia. But the result is greater diversity in the local search market, as a direct result of implementing a choice screen mechanism.\n\n\u201cWe think that all regulatory agencies that are now considering search market competition should really implement this remedy immediately,\u201d says Weinberg. \u201cThey should do other things\u2026 as well but I don\u2019t see any reason why one should wait on not implementing this because it would take a while to roll out and it\u2019s a good start.\u201d\n\nOf course US regulators have yet to issue any antitrust findings against Google \u2014 despite there now being tens of investigations into \u201cpotential monopolistic behavior\u201d. And Weinberg concedes that US regulators haven\u2019t yet reached the stage of discussing remedies.\n\n\u201cIt feels at a very investigatory stage,\u201d he agrees. \u201cBut we would like to accelerate that\u2026 As well as bigger remedial changes \u2014 similar to privacy and how we\u2019re pushing Do Not Track legislation \u2014 as something you can do right now as kind of low hanging fruit. I view this preference menu in the same way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very high leverage thing that you can do immediately to move market share and increase search competition and so one should do it faster and then take the things that need to be slower slower,\u201d he adds, referring to more radical possible competition interventions \u2014 such as breaking a business up.\n\nThere is certainly growing concern among policymakers around the world that the current modus operandi of enforcing competition law has failed to keep pace with increasingly powerful technology-driven businesses and platforms \u2014 hence \u2018winner takes all\u2019 skews which exist in certain markets and marketplaces, reducing choice for consumers and shrinking opportunities for startups to compete.\n\nThis concern was raised as a question for Europe\u2019s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, during her hearing in front of the EU parliament earlier this month. She pointed to the Commission\u2019s use of interim measures in an ongoing case against chipmaker Broadcom as an example of how the EU is trying to speed up its regulatory response, noting it\u2019s the first time such an application has been made for two decades.\n\nIn a press conference shortly afterwards, to confirm the application of EU interim measures against Broadcom, Vestager added: \u201cInterim measures are one way to tackle the challenge of enforcing our competition rules in a fast and effective manner. This is why they are important. And especially that in fast moving markets. Whenever necessary I\u2019m therefore committed to making the best possible use of this important tool.\u201d\n\nWeinberg is critical of Google\u2019s latest proposals around search engine choice in Europe \u2014 after it released details of its idea to \u2018evolve\u2019 the search choice screen \u2014 by applying an auction model, starting early next year. Other rivals, such as French pro-privacy engine Qwant, have also blasted the proposal.\n\nClearly, how choice screens are implemented is key to their market impact.\n\n\u201cThe way the current design is my read is smaller search engines, including us and including European search engines will not be on the screen long term the way it\u2019s set up,\u201d says Weinberg. \u201cThere will need to be additional changes to get the effects that we were seeing in our studies we made.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s many reasons why us and others would not be those highest bidders,\u201d he says of the proposed auction. \u201cBut needless to say the bigger companies can weigh outbid the smaller ones and so there are alternative ways to set this up.\u201d", "description": "US regulators shouldn\u2019t be sitting on their hands while the 50+ state, federal and congressional antitrust investigations of Google to grind along, search rival DuckDuckGo argues.
