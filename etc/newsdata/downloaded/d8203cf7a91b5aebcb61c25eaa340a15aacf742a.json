He narrowly won reelection last November, three months after he was criminally charged.\n\nThe criminal case arises from Collins's role as a board member and 16.8 percent stakeholder of Australian biotechnology company Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd.\n\nProsecutors allege that in June 2017, while attending the congressional picnic at the White House, Collins learned in an email from Innate's chief executive that the company's experimental multiple sclerosis drug, MIS416, had failed in a clinical trial.\n\n190930180402501\n\nCollins shared the news about the setback with his son, Cameron Collins, who in turn told his fiancee, Lauren Zarsky; her parents, Dorothy and Stephen Zarsky; and a friend, according to prosecutors. Stephen Zarsky went on to tip off additional unnamed people, the prosecutors said.\n\nChris Collins did not trade his own Innate stock, which lost millions of dollars in value. Prosecutors said the congressman was \"virtually precluded\" from trading, in part because he already faced a congressional ethics probe over Innate.\n\nHowever, prosecutors said Cameron Collins and the others used the insider information to avoid a total of more than $768,000 in losses when Innate's share price plunged 92 percent after news of the drug's failure became public.\n\nCameron Collins, 26, and Stephen Zarsky, 67, have been charged in the case and are scheduled to plead guilty on Thursday, court records show.\n\nLauren and Dorothy Zarsky were not criminally charged, but agreed to surrender the money they made selling Innate stock to the Securities and Exchange Commission under a civil settlement without admitting wrongdoing.", "description": "Chris Collins resigned from his seat in the US House of Representatives on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/30/be42815daaee46eeb785118864e6b7cd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
