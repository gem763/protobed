Nichols was upset that the officer, in his opinion, was \u201cleaving his post\u201d by going to get coffee at a nearby convenience shop instead of remaining on campus to protect students, and said that somebody could \u201cshoot up the school\u201d in the officer\u2019s absence. Based on nothing more than that simple remark, Nichols\u2019 life was turned upside down and the Tisbury police have a lot of questions to answer.\n\nNichols said the waitress made a complaint to Tisbury Police about what she overheard and on the strength of that, Saloio and another officer relieved Nichols of his crossing guard duties while he was in the midst of performing them and subsequently drove to his home and took away his firearms license and guns. \u201cHe came up and told me what I said was a felony but he wasn\u2019t going to charge me,\u201d Nichols said of Saloio. The confiscated guns were later turned over to Nichols\u2019 son-in-law, Nichols told The Times. Asked if he was given a letter or any paperwork for the seizure of his license, Nichols said, \u201cNo he just told me to hand it over so I took it out of my wallet and handed it to him.\u201d\n\nNichols says never received any receipts acknowledging the seizure of his firearms either, and notes since he obtained his Massachusetts firearms license in 1958 he\u2019s never had any issues until now.\n\nVirtually every person who heard Nichols\u2019 comment, with the exception of the waitress who complained, says there was nothing threatening about his statement. Far from expressing any intent to harm the students at the local school, Nichols\u2019 was complaining that they were being left unprotected.\n\nNichols said he has 11 grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren. \u201cI would never, ever, ever, harm a child,\u201d he said. Nichols lost his wife two years ago and values his crossing guard work as a connection to the outside world. \u201cI just need something to do to get out of the house and I love the kids,\u201d he said.\n\nThankfully, Nichols does have an attorney, and they\u2019re appealing both the revocation of Nichols\u2019 firearms license as well as his removal as a crossing guard. I hope they\u2019re successful in righting this wrong. We do owe the chief in Tisbury a bit of gratitute, however, for such a great demonstration of the capricious nature of gun licensing laws in Massachusetts. You don\u2019t have to be charged with a crime, much less convicted, to lose your right to keep and bear arms. No, all that\u2019s necessary is for someone to misconstrue what you said, interpret it as a threat, and report your comment to the police. They\u2019ll take it (and your guns) from there, no hearing necessary.\n\nWhat happened to Stephen Nichols could happen to virtually any legal gun owner in the state of Massachusetts, because in Massachusetts the right to keep and bear arms isn\u2019t treated as a right at all. Instead, it\u2019s viewed by the law as a privilege to be doled out and taken away by local police chiefs, and while some might recognize the 2nd Amendment as protecting an individual right, it is clear that there are many who don\u2019t think that at all. With little to no investigation or reason, they can strip you of your license and your firearms, and your only recourse is to engage in a lengthy and expensive appeals process. Thankfully Mr. Nichols is willing to make that engagement, but how many others won\u2019t or can\u2019t afford to do the same?\n\n**Update**\n\nShortly after posting the original story, the local paper on Martha\u2019s Vineyard reported that Nichols has been reinstated as a crossing guard for the local school, but bizarrely, the police are apparently still revoking his firearm license.\n\nDan Larkosh, of the Edgartown firm Larkosh and Jackson, represents Nichols, and he was pleased Nichols was reinstated. Nevertheless he intends to file an appeal of the decision by Tisbury Police Chief Mark Saloio to seize guns owned by Nichols, as well as his license to carry.\n\nGo get \u2019em, Mr. Larkosh. I find it unfathomable that after all this, the police chief hasn\u2019t returned Stephen Nichols\u2019 firearms and issued a groveling apology. It\u2019s clear that would be the right thing to do. It\u2019s a mystery as to why the chief hasn\u2019t done it.", "description": "A military veteran, retired officer, and school crossing guard had his guns seized and lost his job after a comment about the security at his local school.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/55e7dd414f57b114a6da837ec32f2a7f1038dfe55457724d7d_1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
