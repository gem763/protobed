In that time, Berkshire's Class A stock is up 323% while the broad index has gained 334%.\n\n\"Thumb-sucking has not cut the Heinz mustard during the Great Bull Market,\" Rolfe wrote in the third-quarter letter to clients. \"The Great Bull could have been one helluva of an astounding career denouement for Messrs. Buffett and [Vice Chairman Charlie] Munger.\"\n\nNot that Buffett will miss Rolfe much, the RiverPark/Wedgewood Fund owned 48,000 shares of the Berkshire B class of stock, amounting to about $10 million. And Rolfe's performance throughout the bull market has not been the best, either. His fund's annualized returns, net of fees, are 13.6% over the past 10 years through the second quarter, according to a factsheet found in the Wedgewood Partners website. In that time, the S&P 500 has posted an annualized return of 14.7%.\n\nBerkshire's cash pile swelled up to more than $120 billion by the end of the second quarter of 2019, a record for the company. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffet said he wanted to make an \"elephant-sized acquisition\" but noted prices were \"sky-high.\" Rolfe thinks so much cash is a \"considerable impediment of growth\" for the company.", "description": "David Rolfe, a longtime Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and CIO at Wedgewood Partners, is fed up with Warren Buffett.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105892747-1556999310428rtx6ubdx1.jpg?v=1557010409", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
