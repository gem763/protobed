(LON:HYNS) For Its Upcoming Dividend?", "language": "en", "text": "Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Haynes Publishing Group P.L.C.

You can purchase shares before the 10th of October in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 30th of October.\n\nHaynes Publishing Group's next dividend payment will be UK\u00a30.04 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of UK\u00a30.07 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Haynes Publishing Group has a trailing yield of approximately 2.4% on its current stock price of \u00a33.19. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Haynes Publishing Group\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. It paid out 80% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 33% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.\n\nIt's positive to see that Haynes Publishing Group's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick here to see how much of its profit Haynes Publishing Group paid out over the last 12 months.\n\nLSE:HYNS Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Haynes Publishing Group, with earnings per share up 4.9% on average over the last five years. A high payout ratio of 80% generally happens when a company can't find better uses for the cash. Combined with slim earnings growth in the past few years, Haynes Publishing Group could be signalling that its future growth prospects are thin.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Haynes Publishing Group has seen its dividend decline 6.4% per annum on average over the past ten years, which is not great to see. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIs Haynes Publishing Group worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share growth has been modest and Haynes Publishing Group paid out over half of its profits and less than half of its free cash flow, although both payout ratios are within normal limits. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Haynes Publishing Group today.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/h610fcYRr.7yvDf2X5OelA--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/8b825a3161308b31b50a09e6ed6cd21d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
