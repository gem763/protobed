A Factset-compiled consensus had OMV's adjusted net profit at EUR459.5 million.\n\nThe company slightly cut its total upstream production for the full year. It now expects this to be slightly below 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Production in the quarter rose to 480,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from 406,000 barrels of oil a day in the year-earlier period.\n\nSales rose to EUR5.95 billion from EUR5.61 billion the previous year and compared with a Factset-compiled consensus of EUR5.71 billion. The group's effective tax rate decreased to 39% from 46% in the year-earlier period, OMV said.\n\nOMV said it expects its organic capital expenditure, which excludes acquisitions, to be about EUR2.3 billion in the full-year, up from EUR1.9 billion in 2018.\n\nWrite to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 02:53 ET (06:53 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
