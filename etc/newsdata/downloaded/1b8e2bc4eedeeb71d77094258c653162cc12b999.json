(Gary A. Vasquez/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNBA star Lebron James has criticized Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey for tweeting in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.\n\n\u201cWe all talk about this freedom of speech, yes, we all do have freedom of speech,\u201d James told reporters before his game Monday night. \u201cBut at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand,\u201d James continued. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed\u201d by Morey\u2019s comments.\n\nMorey removed his tweet and apologized to Chinese fans, but the Chinese Basketball Association had already moved to cut ties with the Rockets. Merchandise featuring the Rockets logo and in some cases general NBA products were removed from sportswear stores in major Chinese cities after the incident.\n\nNBA officials who tried to assuage the Chinese were pilloried by U.S. elected officials, who accused the NBA of kowtowing to China.\n\nChina is the NBA\u2019s largest market after the U.S. The Lakers and Nets recently played two exhibition games in China, but they were cut from television viewing following the controversy.", "description": "\"I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation,\" James said, claiming \"So many people could have been harmed\" by Daryl Morey's comments on the protesters.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Katherine Timpf", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
