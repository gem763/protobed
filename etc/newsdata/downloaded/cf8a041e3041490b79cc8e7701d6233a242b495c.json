The U.S. blames Iran for the strike, and tensions between the two countries have spiked. (Amr Nabil/AP)\n\nEscalating tensions between the United States and Iran have raised the prospect that Iraq could again became the terrain on which these two powers pursue their shadow war and a staging ground for attacks on American and allied forces in the region.\n\nBut recent developments suggest that the government in Baghdad is trying to clip the wings of the powerful Iran-aligned militias operating in Iraq, just as Tehran is looking for its proxies and allies in the Middle East to intensify the pressure on U.S. interests.\n\nIraqi officials are worried that their country could get sucked into the conflict, with concerns spiking after a May 14 drone strike on a pipeline in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The officials were embarrassed to learn that the attack had not come from Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, who had claimed responsibility for the strike, but from Iraqi territory, said lawmakers and Western officials who described the fallout.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister was very angry,\u201d said one lawmaker, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nA tense meeting followed between Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi and Faleh al-Fayyadh, chairman of the coalition of mostly Shiite Muslim paramilitaries, some aligned with Iran, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, according to several people familiar with the meeting.\n\nAbdul Mahdi demanded, \u201cTake care of it,\u201d one of those people said.\n\n\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi addresses the parliament in October 2018.

It was notable that U.S. and Iraqi officials said they were relatively confident that this time the staging ground was not Iraq.\n\n\u201cNotice the confidence,\u201d said the Iraqi lawmaker. \u201cThe prime minister immediately issued a statement denying it had come from Iraq. Unlike the earlier strike, where he faced embarrassment, this time he was sure.\u201d\n\nThe backlash against the earlier attack \u201cmade it uncomfortable for the [militias] to do it again,\u201d said Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute. \u201cIraq dodged a bullet here, and it wasn\u2019t luck. It was because a spotlight got shone on the May 14 strike.\u201d\n\nIraqi lawmakers fear that attacks launched from their soil would not only inflame regional tensions but could provoke reprisals against targets inside their country, drawing Iraq into another ruinous conflict. As the head of a divided government, Abdul Mahdi\u2019s hand remains weak.\n\nIn a sign of Baghdad\u2019s delicate diplomacy, Iraqi President Barham Salih met separately this week in New York with President Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nAbdul Mahdi, meanwhile, was received by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh to discuss this month\u2019s attacks on the oil installations.\n\nIn comments made alongside Trump, Salih described efforts to bring the country\u2019s paramilitaries to heel as a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d\n\nMilitiamen from the PMF still operate with relative autonomy across much of Iraq. A July 31 deadline for their formal incorporation into the Iraqi army has been extended, with patchy results.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a military organization. It\u2019s also a political, social and economic network, and you can\u2019t just integrate that easily,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank.\n\nBut for the PMF, known in Arabic as the Hashd, there are also advantages to becoming part of Iraq\u2019s official security forces. That status can legitimize the power of groups within the paramilitary coalition. It also \u201cgives formal cover,\u201d Mansour said. \u201cIt gives groups the chance to operate without being attacked from outside.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian-backed militias played a pivotal role in ousting the Islamic State from Iraq two years ago. But in the years after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iran also sponsored militia violence against American troops, flooding the country with powerful roadside bombs that killed hundreds.\n\nIn recent months, elements within the PMF have repeatedly been blamed for rocket attacks on U.S. forces and their Iraqi allies, with crude projectiles striking the area of military bases. Early Tuesday, one rocket landed inside the sprawling U.S. Embassy complex in Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone and another nearby in an empty lot.\n\nThe purpose of these strikes, experts say, was to harass but not provoke. They were meant as reminders that the militias have the ability to launch more-damaging strikes in the event of escalation.\n\nThe broader regional tensions have also aggravated divisions within the PMF\u2019s leadership.\n\nAfter suspected Israeli airstrikes this summer targeted militia bases, the PMF\u2019s powerful deputy leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who is close to parts of the Iranian establishment, explicitly blamed both the United States and Israel. Fayyadh disputed that accusation, saying Muhandis didn\u2019t speak for the paramilitary coalition.\n\n\u201cHow they handle this now will be critical,\u201d said another Iraqi official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue. \u201cThe Hashd is a time bomb, and the prime minister needs to come down against them, but he won\u2019t be able to do so for long. It depends on how Fayyadh can control them.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nIran\u2019s gamble: Analysts say brazen attack aimed to pressure U.S. with little fear of reprisal\n\nIran\u2019s strategic use of drones and missiles rattles Middle East rivals\n\nBillions spent on U.S. weapons didn\u2019t protect Saudi oil sites from attack\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Iraqi officials fear being drawn into a regional conflict between Iran and the U.S.", "authors": ["Louisa Loveluck", "Reporter In The Washington Post'S Beirut Bureau", "Focusing On Syria.", "Mustafa Salim", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a0JywJAWm-0jS2UyYZjjR0WZVpc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A5SGO2HAMII6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
