(The Telegraph)\n\nTalking point: Musk\u2019s Boring Company used to sell a novelty device called Not a Flamethrower, so named to skirt around customs regulations that restrict transporting flamethrowers. The Boring Company\u2019s website says Not a Flamethrower, which featured a small propane tank and trigger mechanism, sold 20,000 models. The company also sold branded fire extinguishers. Escobar claims that he discussed the design for a novelty flamethrower with one of Musk\u2019s engineers in 2017. When Escobar first threatened to sue Musk in July, Musk tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s not a flamethrower, Mr. Escobar,\u201d adding that he actually stole the idea from the film Spaceballs.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
