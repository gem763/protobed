It said foreign forces were the target.\n\nThe bomb targeted a residential compound housing foreigners and the Taliban said gunmen were also involved.\n\nThe attack highlights fears that US negotiations with the Taliban won't end the daily violence in Afghanistan and its terrible toll on civilians.\n\nThe militants now control more territory than at any time since the 2001 US invasion and have so far refused to talk to the Afghan government, whom they deride as American puppets.\n\nThe deal outlined by Mr Khalilzad in an interview with Tolo News is the product of nine rounds of peace talks that have been held in the Gulf state of Qatar.\n\nIn exchange for the US troop withdrawal, the Taliban would ensure that Afghanistan would never again be used as a base for militant groups seeking to attack the US and its allies.\n\n\"We have agreed that if the conditions proceed according to the agreement, we will leave within 135 days five bases in which we are present now,\" Mr Khalilzad said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The view from Lashkar Gah province on whether peace with the Taliban is possible\n\nThe US currently has about 14,000 troops in the country.\n\nA Taliban spokesman confirmed in a text message to the BBC that the details of the troop withdrawal as outlined by Mr Khalilzad were correct.\n\nA pullout of the remaining forces would depend on conditions, including the start of peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban as well as a ceasefire, reports the BBC's Lyse Doucet from Kabul.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani will study the deal before giving any opinion, his spokesman Sediq Seddiqqi said earlier on Monday. He said the government still needed proof the Taliban were committed to peace.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers have been killed and injured. This is their story\n\nMany in Afghanistan fear that a US-Taliban deal could see hard-won rights and freedoms eroded. The militants enforced strict religious laws and treated women brutally under their rule from 1996 to 2001.\n\nWhat's the background to the Afghan war?\n\nIt began when the US launched air strikes one month following the 11 September 2001 attacks and after the Taliban had refused to hand over the man behind them, Osama Bin Laden.\n\nThe US was joined by an international coalition and the Taliban were quickly removed from power. However, they turned into an insurgent force and continued deadly attacks, destabilising subsequent Afghan governments.\n\nThe international coalition ended its combat mission in 2014, staying only to train Afghan forces. But the US continued its own, scaled-back combat operation, including air strikes.\n\nThe Taliban has however continued to gain momentum and last year the BBC found they were active across 70% of Afghanistan.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zan TV presenter Ogai Wardak: \"If the Taliban come, I will fight them\"\n\nNearly 3,500 members of the international coalition forces have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion, more than 2,300 of them American.\n\nThe figures for Afghan civilians, militants and government forces are more difficult to quantify. In a February 2019 report, the UN said that more than 32,000 civilians had died. The Watson Institute at Brown University says 58,000 security personnel and 42,000 opposition combatants have been killed.", "description": "A blast rocks Kabul as the \"deal in principle\" is outlined by the US envoy for peace in Afghanistan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F491/production/_108590626_ad7329e6-d75d-44eb-86a5-23bb9277d2e6.jpg"}
