With Chelsea\u2019s stronger bench undoubtedly the difference, the fresh legs of Ramona Bachmann and Thorisdottir combined to seal the win in front of 4,149 fans.\n\n\u201cI said to the players at half-time: \u2018I promise you, you score a goal and you watch this house lift,\u2019 and it just went vroom, and I thought there\u2019s only one outcome, 4,000 people in here, we are going to smash it, happy days.\u201d\n\nIf Chelsea were out for revenge for the 5-0 drubbing Arsenal dealt out at Kingsmeadow almost exactly one year ago, then it showed. The Blues exploded out of the blocks, Fran Kirby looking particularly fresh as they drove into the box from kick-off. The champions needed just nine minutes to open the scoring. Vivianne Miedema, who has scored four of Arsenal\u2019s 18 goals in all competitions this season, danced into the box before slipping the ball to Van de Donk who coolly slotted past Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\nIt was something of a relief for the Gunners, who looked bright going forward but struggled to contain the pace and slick passing between Kirby, Guro Reiten and the magical Ji So-yun. Chelsea searched for the reply, and Ji was at the heart of every positive attack.\n\nLia Walti, making her first league start as Arsenal ease her back into action following injury, was robbed by Ji in the middle and the South Korean broke into the box, turned round Jen Beattie but lashed her left-footed shot just wide from 20 yards out.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAfter the break Chelsea came out with the bit between their teeth. \u201cI said that we\u2019re going to have to be more aggressive,\u201d said Hayes.\n\n\u201cThis is a really tricky one because I don\u2019t want to tell you how I did it. Because the manager is then going to read those comments and make sure he doesn\u2019t do it again. But I did something. That\u2019s for you to analyse. That\u2019s your job, not mine.\u201d\n\nKeira Walsh pounces early as Manchester City swat aside Birmingham Read more\n\nThey pressed with an intensity that forced Arsenal into sloppy mistakes, with more time on the ball for Ji becoming critical. England, who was a little anonymous in the first half, was the first to trouble the Arsenal back line, picking up Ji\u2019s pinpoint cross but firing over. With Arsenal looking a tad shell shocked, it felt inevitable that they would relinquish the lead, and it was England that would capitalise.\n\nBeattie was dispossessed in the middle but a hungrier Kirby steamed into the space left by Katie McCabe before squaring to England who, with her back to goal, flicked it up, swivelled and volleyed past Manuela Zinsberger from close range.\n\nIf Arsenal needed a wake-up call then the goal provided it, but Chelsea continued to press with intent. To add intensity in the middle, Joe Montemurro swapped Lia Walti for the fresh legs of Jordan Nobbs but with their bench options limited and Chelsea throwing on Bachmann and Thorisdottir, the edge stayed with the Blues.\n\nChelsea 2-1 Arsenal: Women's Super League \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nWith five minutes left to play Bachmann squared to the Norwegian Thorisdottir, who slammed home from 25 yards to send the heaving crowd wild. \u201cYes,\u201d said Montemurro bluntly when asked whether the score reflected the game. \u201cWe were good in the first half but they were better in the second.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep the ball and our intensity is all ball-based. We were making a lot of fundamental errors which is unlike us and we got punished for it. With the squad that Chelsea have got, with the individual talent they\u2019ve got, with the size of the squad that they\u2019ve got they should be up there every year. So today is obviously an indication of who they are, they\u2019re a good team, they\u2019re a powerful team.\u201d", "description": "Chelsea ended Arsenal\u2019s unbeaten run, coming from behind to secure a 2-1 victory", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c9119dd13afc4588c496405a27197e42b2fc009/1192_74_2892_1736/master/2892.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a232966b69b9e2034d583dd3ed4898a", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
