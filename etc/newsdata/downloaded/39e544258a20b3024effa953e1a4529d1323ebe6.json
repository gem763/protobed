Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture released rules Tuesday that will govern how farmers grow industrial hemp, a crop that promises new revenue for financially struggling growers.\n\nThe USDA regulations will guide the production of hemp, including licensing farmers, testing and possible destruction of plants that don't meet THC requirements.\n\nIt's a big step for farmers hoping to tap into a rapidly growing market for hemp-derived cannabidiol, commonly called CBD, used in everything from pet food to wine and creams that help relieve minor aches and pains. The $5 billion market is expected to grow to nearly $24 billion by 2023.\n\nWith licensing expected to begin early next year, Iowa farmers should be able to plant their first hemp crop next spring, said Robin Pruisner, the state entomologist who is helping lead the Iowa Department of Agriculture's efforts to develop a hemp program.\n\nXanax recall 2019: Generic drug, Alprazolam, recalled for 'potential presence of a foreign substance'\n\nChicken sandwich war: Popeyes announces return date of its chicken sandwich and takes a dig at Chick-fil-A\n\nIn this Oct. 5, 2013 photo, a volunteer walks through a hemp field at a farm in Springfield, Colo. during the first known harvest of industrial hemp in the U.S. since the 1950s.

Iowa lawmakers followed suit this year, passing a hemp bill that Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law in May.\n\nIowa officials, already developing a state hemp program, will review the federal rule to ensure their work complies with it. The state plan also must receive USDA approval before Iowa's program can become effective.\n\nAlthough promising, Pruisner warns that the emerging market could be extremely risky for farmers. Not only are they growing a new crop, but they will also be selling it into a new market that can be tricky to navigate.\n\nThis Sept. 25, 2016 photo, shows seeds from the first legal crop of industrial hemp grown on JD Farms in Eaton, N.Y.

(Photo: Mary Esch, AP)\n\n\u201cI strongly, strongly, strongly promote the concept that no one should plant hemp unless they have a contract to sell it,\u201d Pruisner said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t like corn, that you can sell to the elevator or the ethanol plant,\" she said. \"You need to know where it\u2019s going and what their requirements are,\" such as hitting certain levels for pesticides, heavy metals or other compounds.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be sold before you plant it, so you know exactly how to raise it,\" Pruisner said.\n\nIowa's new law restricts farmers to growing only 40 acres of hemp.\n\nFarmers also need to make sure they understand how hemp is priced. For example, some farmers told Pruisner they didn't get paid until their crops were processed, and the plant was backed up for a year.\n\nProducers will need to closely manage hemp as it grows, testing it to make sure THC levels don't exceed 0.3%. Hemp with higher levels will be destroyed.\n\nAn average of 30% of the hemp grown in Minnesota ends up exceeding the THC limit, Pruisner said. That leaves farmers with the costs to become licensed, grow and test a crop, and no revenue.\n\nUSDA officials said no crop insurance will cover losses due to high THC levels.\n\n\"Farmers will really have to be on their game to manage this crop,\" she said. \"It's not a crop you plant and walk away from.\"\n\nEven before planting their first seeds, Iowa farmers will have to apply for a license, which requires them to submit their fingerprints for a background check.\n\nGreg Ibach, USDA's under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs, said the number of hemp acres is expected to climb about 420% to 500,000 this year compared to 2018.\n\n\"The experience producers have this fall harvesting their crop, handling their crop and finding buyers for their crop will be instructive as to whether we see continued growth in the hemp industry or whether growers take a step back,\" Ibach said in a call with reporters.\n\nAnd Pruisner said it's unclear if demand for hemp-derived CBDs and other products will keep pace with the growing supply.\n\n\"I don't know if prices will stay up,\" she said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/29/usda-hemp-farming-regulations-new-crop-cbd-products/2503591001/", "description": "Farmers are moving closer to being able to grow hemp next spring after USDA's release of its requirements for the crop.", "authors": ["Donnelle Eller", "Published P.M.
