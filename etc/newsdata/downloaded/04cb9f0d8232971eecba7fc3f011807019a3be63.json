Looney will take up the CEO role and join the BP board on Feb. 5, the company said.\n\nDudley took the reins as CEO from Tony Hayward in 2010, taking over responsibility for the Gulf of Mexico oil-spill containment and cleanup operation. The 2010 explosion killed 11 people and unleashed the worst offshore oil spill in American history. Dudley also navigated the company through a collapse in oil prices, which forced the entire industry to cut costs and adjust to a world of cheaper crude.\n\n\u201cDuring his tenure he has led the recovery from the Deepwater Horizon accident, rebuilt BP as a stronger, safer company and helped it re-earn its position as one of the leaders of the energy sector,\u201d said Chairman Helge Lund. \u201cThis company -- and indeed the whole industry -- owes him a debt of gratitude.\u201d\n\nBefore becoming CEO, Dudley ran BP\u2019s joint venture with a group of Russian billionaires, TNK-BP Ltd., but was forced out in 2008 following a dispute over control of the company.\n\nDudley will formally step down as CEO in February and retire in March.\n\nLooney has run BP\u2019s upstream business since April 2016 and has been a member of the group\u2019s executive management team since November 2010, the company said. Looney\u2019s base annual salary will be GBP1.3 million ($1.6 million), BP said.\n\nLamar McKay, BP\u2019s deputy group chief executive, will serve as chief transition officer.", "description": "The outgoing BP CEO will be succeeded by Bernard Looney, currently chief executive of the oil company\u2019s Upstream segment", "authors": ["Adria Calatayud"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
