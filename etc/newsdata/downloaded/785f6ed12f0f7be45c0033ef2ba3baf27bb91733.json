Chilly in the northeast.\n\n\"On Saturday, rain continues across southern areas, reaching parts of central England for a time; a cool-feeling day. Northern areas will be brighter with scattered showers, most frequent in the northwest.\n\n\"Sunday to Tuesday will be often cloudy with rain or showers across central and southern areas, but generally brighter with isolated showers in the north. Rain and stronger winds arrive from the west on Tuesday.\"\n\nThere are nine flood alerts in place today, most of which are in the South West. The Environment Agency also has one more serious flood warning for the Winford Brook at Chew Magna in Somerset.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWaves have been pictured crashing against the harbour wall at Dover in Kent during today's storms.\n\nFrom October 16, there is a risk of coastal gales in the north west with rain or showers at times cementing the theme of unsettled weather.\n\nIt will often be windy, particularly in the north and west, with gales in places.\n\nSouthern and eastern parts will generally be a little drier and temperatures should still remain around average for this time of the year, although it may feel colder at times in the wind and rain.\n\nThere is the potential for some overnight frost or fog, which would be slow to clear.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nTowards the end of October and into November, the Met Office says \"changeable conditions could well dominate\".\n\nThis will bring further bouts of wet and windy weather with short-lived drier and brighter spells. Overnight frost and fog will become more widespread.\n\nThe west of the UK will be wet and windy and temperatures will be mild by day and cool by night.\n\nThe spokesman added: \"Early signs for mid November indicate a return to frequent bands of rain and strong winds moving from west to east.\"", "description": "The Met Office UK weather forecast is all doom and gloom as from now into November looks to be blighted with wet windy weather and frost and fog arriving", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Metoffice", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562892.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Autumn-weather-Oct-11th.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
