Facebook wants \"your kids. Now, they're posting political ads with incorrect information. They're passing your information to 50,000 other companies \u2014 you don't even know what's happening.\"\n\nBenioff said with Facebook buying apps like WhatsApp and Instagram, it has them comingled in lots of companies.\n\n\"They're creating market segments called 'the persuadables' and shifting elections based on that data,\" Benioff said. \"That's not good. Nobody wants that.\n\n\"We want a society based on trust and truth.\" - Marc Benioff, Salesforce co-CEO\n\n\"That's so important, and this is something we all need to be committed to,\" Benioff said. \"We have to focus on trust as our highest value.\"\n\nUnder the new rules outlined by the Paris-based organization, countries would have the capability to tax digital companies based on sales, rather than physical presence. This is because digital companies don\u2019t require a physical presence to run their business within a certain country, so they benefit from the current system that taxes them based on the location of their operations and assets and not where their sales are generated.\n\nAccording to a recent European Union report, digital companies pay, on average, half of what their traditional brick-and-mortar counterparts do in taxes \u2014 even as their revenue expands four times as fast as revenue for other multinational companies.\n\nFOX Business' Megan Henney contributed to this report.", "description": "\"Facebook is the new cigarettes,\" Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff said.", "authors": ["Blair Shiff"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/facebook.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
