A-listers will now be jostling for space in the hope that they, too, might receive that all-important awards boost.\n\nOne of the most anticipated titles of the festival is fact-based drama Hustlers, which stars Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Lizzo and Cardi B as strippers using their wiles to rob their wealthy clientele. The film, which is tracking for an impressive $26m opening weekend, is also getting early Oscar buzz for Lopez. \u201cI think people forget that she\u2019s such a gifted actor,\u201d writer-director Lorene Scafaria said to Variety. \u201cI was so excited that she was going to play a character on top of that. In a way, the role fits her like a glove, but it\u2019s also a glove with spikes on it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of many films at the festival directed by a woman, at odds with the lack of gender parity reflected in the lineup at Venice this year. Can You Ever Forgive Me? director Marielle Heller will also bring her latest film to Toronto, biographical drama A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, starring Tom Hanks as much-loved kids TV personality Mister Rogers. They will both be joined by Kasi Lemmons\u2019 Harriet Tubman biopic starring Cynthia Erivo; Persepolis director Marjane Satrapi\u2019s Marie Curie biopic Radioactive with Rosamund Pike; and Blackfish director Gabriela Cowperthwaite\u2019s drama The Friend, starring Casey Affleck and Dakota Johnson.\n\nOne of the festival\u2019s most curious inclusions comes from New Zealand film-maker Taika Waititi, known for vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows and more recently Thor: Ragnarok. His latest Jojo Rabbit is a second world war comedy, described as \u201can anti-hate satire\u201d about a young boy who befriends an imaginary Adolf Hitler, played by Waititi himself.\n\n\u201cOf course there\u2019s a line,\u201d Waititi said about potential controversy. \u201cThere\u2019s always a line. But for me I think I find it naturally; what would I feel embarrassed to show people? Then I wouldn\u2019t put it in. If there\u2019s any time I feel like something is inappropriate I pull back.\u201d The film also stars Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nicole Kidman and Ansel Elgort in The Goldfinch.

It stars Ansel Elgort as a young man dealing with the death of his mother, who was killed in an explosion. Nicole Kidman, Sarah Paulson and Jeffrey Wright also star.\n\nThe Last Jedi and Looper director Rian Johnson will be unveiling his starry whodunnit Knives Out, an Agatha Christie homage starring Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Lakeith Stanfield, Toni Colette and Christopher Plummer. \u201cIt all started with Daniel Craig, he was the first piece of the puzzle, kind of the central piece that clicked into place,\u201d Johnson told the Observer. \u201cOnce we had him cast, suddenly we started making the movie, and so we are able to go out to all these amazing actors and say: hey, do you want to come out to Boston and have fun doing a murder mystery? We got very, very lucky.\u201d\n\nAfter premiering his irreverent satire The Death of Stalin at the festival in 2017 to great acclaim, Armando Iannucci returns to Toronto this year with his Charles Dickens adaptation The Personal History of David Copperfield, starring Dev Patel in the central role. Iannucci has called it \u201ca film about compassion, humour, generosity and friendship\u201d. Other British films at the festival include Ordinary Love with Liam Neeson and Lesley Manville as a couple dealing with cancer, and Michael Winterbottom\u2019s Greed starring Steve Coogan as a billionaire.\n\nThe 10-day long festival arrives after both Venice and Telluride saw Oscar buzz growing for Renee Zellweger\u2019s performance as Judy Garland in Judy, and Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s take on the infamous DC villain in Joker. Both films will also play at Toronto.", "description": "This year\u2019s festival will unveil some of the most hotly anticipated movies, and a string of A-listers are hoping for awards buzz", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/104411f9a6c6d0ca91baecb9f27f418458e47722/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=914829423203a4367139f28a48305212"}
