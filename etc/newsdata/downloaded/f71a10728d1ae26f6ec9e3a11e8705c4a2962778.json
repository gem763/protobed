The Convention has been ratified by 187 states as of 2018.\n\nRUSADA was deemed \" non-compliant\" in 2015 and was suspended by WADA. The Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory, which processed blood and urine samples from the country's athletes, was decertified in the move.\n\nWADA on Monday said data it received from the Moscow lab in January as part of an investigation into RUSADA's compliance status was found to contain unspecified \"inconsistencies.\"\n\nRead more: Timeline of Russia's doping cases and cover-ups\n\nThe Russian agency has been given three weeks to explain the discrepancies, or it faces a potential ban from sporting events that have signed up to WADA's anti-doping code, including the International Olympic Committee, the International Football Federation (FIFA), and dozens of other sporting authorities.\n\nToru Hanai/Reuters\n\nIf Russia is unable to provide an adequate explanation to WADA, it could be banned from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022, and other world-class sporting events.\n\nThe chairman of WADA's compliance panel, Jonathan Taylor, told BBC Sport that there was evidence that some of the data had been deleted. He added that if the investigating experts maintain their current view on RUSADA's non-compliance, they could propose sanctions against Russia.\n\n\"There is now a starting point for the sanctions that can go up and down, and they do include sanctions against RUSADA and options include no events hosted in Russia, and they do include no participation of Russian athletes in world championships and up to the Olympics,\" he told the BBC.\n\nA woman walks into the head office for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on November 9, 2015.
