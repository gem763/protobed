But his half-smiling poker face is ironclad. He\u2019s serious but still winking at you.\n\nHis farm-to-table restaurant, Holy Chicken, is also the namesake of his latest film, \u201cSuper Size Me 2: Holy Chicken.\u201d It\u2019s a sequel to the Oscar-nominated stunt documentary that made him famous 15 years ago as the jocular redhead who ate McDonald\u2019s food exclusively for a month. This time, his new gimmick flips the script: Instead of consuming fast food, Spurlock starts selling it.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything out of making a career out of questionable life choices,\u201d Spurlock says at the start of the film, \u201cit\u2019s that sometimes the only way to find the truth and solve the problem is to become a part of that problem.\u201d\n\n[In Ali Wong\u2019s new Netflix rom-com, food is the butt of jokes \u2014 and her true love]\n\nQuestionable life choices. Spurlock might be referring to his McDonald\u2019s bender, or any of the other stunts he\u2019s pulled on television, ostensibly for the edification of his viewers \u2014 living on minimum wage for a month, spending several weeks in prison, briefly working in a coal mine. But it\u2019s been his off-screen life choices that recently left his career (and \u201cSuper Size Me 2,\u201d for a time) in limbo.\n\nIn 2017, amid a wave of Me Too revelations elsewhere in the entertainment industry, Spurlock proactively admitted to bad behavior in his past, including a sexual harassment case that he had settled eight years earlier with a former assistant. Bettering himself and making amends doesn\u2019t have to happen in the public eye, he says, so he resigned from his production company and stepped out of the spotlight. \u201cI am part of the problem,\u201d he wrote then. \u201cWe all are. But I am also part of the solution.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpurlock and his then-wife Alex Jamieson arrive at the Academy Awards in 2005. He was nominated for his documentary \u201cSuper Size Me.\u201d (Kevork Djansezian/AP)\n\nSo, back on the big screen, what is Morgan Spurlock part of now \u2014 the problem, or the solution?\n\nIn \u201cSuper Size Me 2,\u201d which was yanked from the 2018 Sundance slate after Spurlock stepped away and now marks his comeback a year later, he is both. Spurlock is once again up to his muckraking high jinks, delivering the scoop from within the very structures of American fast-food mongering and corporate agribusiness that he seeks to critique.\n\nThe scoop: the companies that sell us fast food have been sneakily presenting themselves to customers as healthier and more socially responsible \u2014 deploying such feel-good terms as \u201cartisanal\u201d and \u201chandcrafted\u201d that amount to little more than empty, market-tested signaling. Those labels slapped onto Perdue or Tyson chicken in the frozen aisle, Spurlock observes, don\u2019t actually tell you much about what happens behind the scenes. \u201cFree-range,\u201d for example, just means that chickens are presented the option of going outdoors for \u201csome\u201d part of the day.\n\n[Fact-checking \u2018Eating Animals\u2019: What the film gets right and wrong]\n\nSpurlock teams up with an Alabama poultry farmer named Jonathan Buttram and his family to raise his own chickens after getting stonewalled by larger producers, and he has fun playing by the industry\u2019s standards. \u201cYou\u2019re living the chicken dream!\u201d Spurlock says to one of his young, \u201cfree-range\u201d birds, grinning wryly as the chick waddles in a fenced space extending only a few feet from the door.\n\nThe documentary\u2019s main target is the multibillion-dollar chicken industry\u2019s big five megacompanies \u2014 the \u201cChicken Mafia,\u201d as Buttram calls them. They pay their farmers through a \u201ctournament system,\u201d pitting grower against grower, where griping about unfair conditions often leads to a flock of smaller, even sicker birds the next month, triggering a cycle of lower output and lower compensation.\n\n\n\nSpurlock in \u201cSuper Size Me 2.\u201d (Samuel Goldwyn Films)\n\n\u201cFarmers and chickens are being mistreated,\u201d Buttram told The Washington Post. \u201cSince this movie was made three years ago, it\u2019s gotten a lot worse.\u201d (In the film Buttram and his family, who say they have been victims of corporate retaliation for cooperating with Spurlock, serve as the main avatars of the family farms that they say suffer under this regime.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a company out there that tells you the truth about their food, where it comes from, what it means to the environment we live in,\u201d Spurlock told The Post. \u201cAnd we live in a time now when people crave that level of honesty and information.\u201d\n\nAnd so, he offers moviegoers and potential customers the honesty he believes they crave \u2014 alongside the fried chicken they definitely do crave \u2014 not by sneaking cameras into the Chicken Mafia\u2019s inner sanctum, but by laying bare his own restaurant\u2019s operations.\n\nSpurlock ventures into a lab with food scientists and chefs to concoct the highlight of his menu: a Grilled Crispy Chicken sandwich. It\u2019s \u201ccrispy\u201d because the word \u201cfried\u201d is marketing taboo. It\u2019s not really \u201cgrilled\u201d since grilling fried chicken would overcook it. Instead, \u201cgrill marks\u201d are painted on with dark food coloring.\n\nBy the film\u2019s end, Spurlock has an operational Holy Chicken pop-up in Ohio. It\u2019s an in-your-face, postmodern fantasia of reds, greens and boldface messaging. It\u2019s also an exercise in radical transparency in the fast-food industry. A wall displays such phrases as \u201call natural\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d along with a block of text beginning with, \u201cNot sure what all these words actually mean? Great! Because, legally speaking, they don\u2019t mean much.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpurlock at his chicken restaurant. (Samuel Goldwyn Films)\n\nThe Ohio pop-up is just the start of what Spurlock envisions as a minor revolution beyond the film. How large that movement gets will depend on how large the market is for fast food restaurants functioning as gallery-styled exhibitions of these restaurants\u2019 various deceptions. Success can mean proving that you can run a chicken place that has a healthier relationship with its suppliers and customers than the industry currently extends, even if it still serves fried chicken with grill marks painted on it. It\u2019s not a solution to the problem, but it could be part of one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already identified chicken growers that we\u2019re going to be working with,\u201d Spurlock told The Post. \u201cOnce we open up two, three locations, the goal is to have our own farms, our own integrated system where we can pay these people more money and they can benefit from profit participation.\u201d\n\nIt would seem Spurlock stands to benefit, too. His dual role as filmmaker and restaurateur means that \u201cSuper Size Me 2\u201d does not just do the documentarian\u2019s work of nudging audiences to eat their vegetables. It can also work as a feature-length advertisement for his franchisable business, nudging audiences to eat his chicken.\n\nSpurlock\u2019s return to the screen may leave an odd taste in people\u2019s mouths regardless of how they feel about the film. The culture is still grappling with how and when men who have admitted or been accused of sexual wrongdoing should emerge from exile. In a phone interview, Spurlock said he wanted people to focus not on him and his transgressions but on the farmers who are being squeezed by major chicken processors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that people don\u2019t try and penalize [the farmers] and the message we\u2019re trying to put out based on some things that I said a few years ago,\u201d Spurlock told The Post. \u201cAll I can do is have faith that every day I can continue to be the best person I can and translate that to the work I believe in, which is telling stories that make a difference.\u201d\n\nIf he and Holy Chicken can liberate even a small portion of poultry farmers from the Chicken Mafia\u2019s grip, Spurlock says, that will disrupt the status quo. \u201cOne percent to 2 percent, 2 percent to 3 percent \u2014 just that small movement is a huge movement,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nWhat if Holy Chicken doesn\u2019t turn out scores of food activists, just hungry people on their lunch break? Spurlock is optimistic. He believes people like fried chicken and want to be in on the joke.\n\n\u201cI think the best part,\u201d he said, \u201cis that people can have their chicken and eat it, too.\u201d You could picture him winking as he said it.", "description": "In \u2018Super Size Me 2,\u2019 he opens a restaurant to reveal the latest poses of the fast-food industry.
