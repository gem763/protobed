Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a pick-up to 5.2%.\n\nIn particular, the value of delivered industrial exports fell 4.3% on-year, the first monthly decline since at least two years, Reuters records showed, reflecting the toll that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war is taking on Chinese manufacturers.\n\nThe protracted trade war escalated dramatically last month, with President Donald Trump announcing new tariffs on Chinese goods from Sept. 1, and China letting its yuan currency sharply weaken days later.\n\nAfter Beijing hit back with retaliatory tariffs, Trump said existing levies would also be raised in coming months, in October and December.\n\nWhile the two sides are set to resume face-to-face negotiations in early October, most analysts do not expect a durable trade deal, or even a significant de-escalation, any time soon.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang said in an interview published ahead of the data on Monday that it was \"very difficult\" for the economy to grow at 6% or more and that it faced \"downward pressure\".\n\nTraders expect a cut in the central bank's medium-term loan facility rate (MLF) as early as Tuesday, which would open the way for a reduction in the new loan prime benchmark rate (LPR) later in the week.\n\nSeveral analysts said in recent weeks that China's economic growth was already testing the lower end of Beijing's full-year target of around 6-6.5%, which is likely to spur more policy easing. Second-quarter growth cooled to 6.2%, the weakest in nearly 30 years.\n\n\"The key downside risk is the authorities not stepping up policy support sufficiently,\" said Louis Kuijs, Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.\n\nRoom for stimulus is believed to be limited by worries about rising debt risks, with policy easing by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) expected to be more restrained than the U.S. Federal Reserve or European Central Bank.\n\nTing Lu, Chief China Economist at Nomura wrote in a note after the data release that a cut in the MLF rate by around 10 basis points on Tuesday had become more likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nOTHER DATA ALSO MISSES EXPECTATIONS\n\nNomura's Lu expected September's industrial output to be further hampered by an anti-pollution campaign ahead of and during a key anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1.\n\nThe gloomy August activity data added to signs of broad-based economic weakness, following soft trade and credit reports last week.\n\nRetail sales missed expectations, with growth easing to 7.5%, from 7.6% in July. Analysts had forecast a slight rebound to 7.9%.\n\nAuto sales have slumped all year, prompting the statistics bureau to recently start reporting a new reading on consumption. Stripping out vehicles, retail sales rose 9.3% on-year.\n\nFixed-asset investment also disappointed. It rose 5.5% for the first eight months of the year from the same period in 2018, down from Jan-July's 5.7%. Analysts had expected 5.6%.\n\nIndustrial investment appeared to be the main drag as investment growth in the mining and the manufacturing sectors eased off in the first eight months. But infrastructure investment - a key driver of growth - picked up to 4.2% in the first eight months this year, from 3.8% in January-July period.\n\nThe real estate sector also held up in August to remain one of the few bright spots, with property investment growing at its fastest pace in four months as sales accelerated to the highest in over a year.\n\nAnalysts have been puzzled by slow construction growth earlier in the year, with some citing deteriorating local government finances. China's state planner last month announced it will ease capital requirements for infrastructure projects in the second half this year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Retail sales and investment gauges worsened too, data released on Monday showed, reinforcing views that China is likely to cut some key interest rates this week for the first time in over three years to prevent a sharper slump in activity.
