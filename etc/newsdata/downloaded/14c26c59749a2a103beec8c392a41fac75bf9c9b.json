It was really the nudge from my husband that gave me the confidence and helped me make that final decision. I was ready to take a risk and looking back, I\u2019m so grateful I did that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCharboneau returned to an old passion, as she ran track and cross country in high school and at Colorado State University where she was a walk-on during her junior and senior year. Not winning any races in high school and college gave Charboneau something to reach for when she got into marathon running.\n\nAD\n\nCharboneau\u2019s days mostly consist of running between 10-12 miles in different parts of Colorado and working with a team of trainers to make sure she\u2019s prepared physically and mentality.\n\nCharboneau set the course record at the 2017 Colfax Marathon in Denver before claiming the top spot in the 2018 Los Angeles Marathon, which allowed her to qualify for the 2020 Olympic Trials in February.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAfter winning the Colfax Marathon in 2017, I knew I wasn\u2019t far off from hitting the qualifying standards for the Olympic trials,\u201d Charboneau said. \u201cSince [Los Angeles], I\u2019ve gone through different phrases of worrying about trials, but I started to let that go to focus on doing everything I can do today.\u201d\n\nCharboneau has her eyes set on breaking another course record when she competes in Sunday\u2019s Marine Corps Marathon. Charboneau has spent the majority of her training preparing to beat the marathon\u2019s record time of 2:37 that was set in 1990 by Olga Markova.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cChasing the record is fun because it adds another objective to your running and training,\u201d Charboneau said. \u201cMy training has been less intense and I\u2019ve been faster than I\u2019ve ever been. It\u2019s been a motivator, but I\u2019m proud of myself that I haven\u2019t let it weigh on me all season.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCharboneau has been trying to take a lot of pressure off herself and go back to having fun when running, which is why she decided to run in the Marine Corps Marathon.\n\n\u201cI had to reassess a lot of things and take a step back to look at what is important to me in running,\u201d Charboneau said. \u201cI was putting a lot of pressure on myself because those were the world majors and we\u2019re going into the pre-Olympic year. I wanted to pick a fun race and I\u2019ve heard so many good things from every runner I know that ran Marine Corps Marathon and it\u2019s one of the best races they\u2019ve run. Taking a lot of the pressure off, and D.C. is one my favorite places to run in. It has a cool vibe and I\u2019m kind of a history buff.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWith the Marine Corps Marathon and Olympic trials looming, Charboneau had to put acting, her second passion, in the back seat in order to focus on running. However, she still finds ways to manage both career paths.\n\nAD\n\nActing came into Charboneau\u2019s life around the same time she decided to launch her professional running career. Charboneau studied comedy and theater in Chicago before returning to Denver to continue her studies at The Bovine Metropolis Theater where she currently teaches and perform comedic shows.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m leading up to trials, running takes precedent over everything,\u201d Charboneau said. \u201cSometimes I have to turn down acting gigs and comedy gigs because training comes first. It\u2019s pretty manageable since I don\u2019t have a day job, so I put my runs where I need to in my schedule. I teach improv or perform comedy in the evenings.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The Colorado runner will participate in Sunday's Marine Corps Marathon to help alleviate some of the pressure she's felt from trying to crack Team USA.", "authors": ["Ryan Mcfadden"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xtskGdtL5SLykUqiGeztMc3I_PA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XNFPIR76FZEDJAPMNZKM7AGDLE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
