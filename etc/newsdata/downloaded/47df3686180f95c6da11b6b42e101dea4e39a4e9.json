His decision went against the advice of foreign-policy and nuclear experts and was condemned by key US allies.\n\nSince then, tensions between Washington and Tehran have steadily increased, reaching a boiling point this summer and sparking fears of a new war in the Middle East, particularly after the US deployed military assets to the region in May.\n\nRead more: Here's what's in the landmark nuclear deal that Iran just violated amid tensions with Trump\n\nThe Trump administration has pursued a \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran since withdrawing from the deal, slapping it with harsh economic sanctions with the goal of pushing it toward negotiating and accepting a more stringent version of the 2015 deal. Foreign-policy experts and former national officials have expressed skepticism at the notion that Trump could negotiate a \"better\" deal than the Obama-era nuclear pact, to which key US allies remain committed.\n\nIran remained in compliance with the 2015 deal until July, when it began violating key portions by increasing its uranium stockpile and exceeding limits on uranium enrichment. This came not long after oil tanker attacks in the Persian Gulf, which the Trump administration blamed on Iran.\n\nIran also shot down a US drone in June, which almost led Trump to approve retaliatory military strikes, and in July it seized a British-flagged tanker in the Gulf of Oman in retaliation for the UK's seizure of an Iranian tanker in Gibraltar.\n\nCurrent and former US officials have pointed to Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 deal as the catalyst for Iran's aggressive behavior.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut in May told Insider that while he did not defend Iran's actions, \"we knew this was the likely outcome\" of \"backing out of the JCPOA.\"\n\n\"We're backing them into a corner, and you just don't know what happens when a country as belligerent as Iran starts to panic,\" Murphy said.\n\nSimilarly, Aaron David Miller, a former State Department adviser, in June told Insider that we were witnessing an \"unraveling\" that began when Trump withdrew from the deal.\n\nTrump's hawkish advisers have driven the crisis with Iran\n\nTrump's Iran policy has been driven by advisers with reputations as foreign-policy hawks: John Bolton, the national security adviser, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state.\n\nIn the past, Bolton has openly advocated military strikes against Iran. And though the Trump administration has maintained that its policy is not designed to lead to regime change in Tehran, some in Washington aren't entirely convinced.\n\nThe Trump administration in late July sanctioned Iran's top diplomat, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Matt Duss, a foreign-policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, told Insider that this move showed there was \"clearly a faction inside\" the Trump administration whose goal with Iran is \"clearly regime change,\" pointing to Bolton and Pompeo.\n\nDuss said these advisers, who are supported by anti-Iran groups in Washington, had \"this fantasy\" that if they maintain \"maximum pressure\" on Tehran then \"something will happen, and we'll end up with an Iranian government that's better.\"\n\n\"The problem is that's never happened,\" Duss said, describing their approach to US-Iran relations as \"unfalsifiable\" and \"completely ideological.\"\n\nThe 2015 nuclear deal is crumbling", "description": "A year before Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, the CIA circulated a classified document offering a \"simple\" and prescient conclusion.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.I5AkR3vDXhVtKeAx7xenQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/1bda97255d654acf6d4e57faa00161c1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
