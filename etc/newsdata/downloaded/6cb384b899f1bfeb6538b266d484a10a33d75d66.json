REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nThe airlines said in a joint statement on Thursday that if agreed the partnership would come into effect in the middle of next year.\n\nNorwegian, Europe\u2019s third-largest budget carrier, has shaken up the market for travel across the Atlantic with cut-price fares that challenge traditional carriers such as IAG\u2019s (ICAG.L) British Airways, but its breakneck expansion left it with high debts and in the red.\n\nThe partnership with JetBlue will connect JetBlue flights from around 100 cities in the Americas to Norwegian\u2019s network in New York, Boston and Fort Lauderdale, from which the carrier serves more than 20 European destinations.\n\nThe deal could help both airlines to boost traffic and the average fares they earn as transatlantic services are extended beyond the biggest U.S. cities, Bernstein analyst David Vernon said.\n\nNorwegian already has a European partnership with London Gatwick-based easyJet (EZJ.L), but until now lacked a U.S. partner.\n\nWhile Norwegian and other low-cost long-haul operators have challenged the big network carriers on their main intercontinental routes, the incumbents\u2019 connecting traffic to smaller destinations has so far remained largely out of reach.\n\n\u201cIf you compete on a purely point-to-point basis, you\u2019re in the most commoditized, lowest-yielding segment of the market with no subset of passengers to destinations that rivals can\u2019t get to,\u201d Bernstein\u2019s Vernon said.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Norwegian to capture some extra, more profitable traffic,\u201d he added.\n\nShares in Norwegian Air, which is cutting costs to try and return to profit, surged 10% on the news before giving up some gains to trade up 3.8% by 1248 GMT, outperforming an Oslo benchmark index .OSEBX up 0.6%.\n\n\u201cCustomers will have the possibility to book connecting flights on both airlines\u2019 websites by combining the best of our complementary and expansive networks,\u201d the airlines said.\n\nJetBlue Airways Corp has said that it hopes to break into the low-fare, transatlantic travel market.\n\n\u201cThis new agreement ... seamlessly connects JetBlue\u2019s robust network throughout the U.S., Caribbean and Latin America with ... exciting European destinations,\u201d JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said in the statement.", "description": "Norwegian Air and New York's JetBlue Airways plan a partnership enabling passengers flying between Europe and the United States to continue to multiple destinations under a single booking, potentially boosting traffic and average fares.", "authors": ["Victoria Klesty", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441903524&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0T6", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
