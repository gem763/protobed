In a recent interview with Submission Radio, Askren sounded off on the former UFC interim champion and reminded everyone of his warnings.\n\n\u201cColby\u2019s a terrible person,\u201d Askren said. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling the outside world this for many years. I am in the wrestling community. The wrestling community is tight knit. We knows who sucks and doesn\u2019t suck. Here\u2019s the deal. Everywhere Colby\u2019s been, nobody likes him. They don\u2019t like him. No good reviews.\u201d\n\nRecently, rivals haven\u2019t been the only ones to blast Covington. His own teammates at American Top Team have chimed in. Jorge Masvidal, Joanna Jedrzejczyk, and Dustin Poirier have all publicly stated they don\u2019t care for Covington\u2019s character or antics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing that come out of ATT,\u201d Askren said. \u201cEveryone has been trying to keep quiet, but think about the people that have come out against him: Joanna, Dustin, Jorge. I\u2019m mean, who likes him?\n\n\u201cCan you guys name me one person from ATT who stuck up and said, \u2018You know what? I actually think Colby is a really good guy. He\u2019s just misunderstood. Hey, Colby adds a lot to this team.\u2019 Can you guys name me one person who\u2019s said that?\u201d\n\nAlthough Covington\u2019s antics have caused controversy time and time again, a general belief amongst the MMA community is that he\u2019s playing a character. He\u2019s using his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d garb and in-your-face trash talk in order to promote fights.\n\nAskren sees this sentiment as true, but he said Covington is still a person of poor character, even when he\u2019s being his genuine non-gimmick self.\n\n\u201cGenuinely, nobody likes him,\u201d Askren said. \u201cIn real life, he\u2019s really a douchebag. For real. Real talk.\u201d\n\nAt UFC 245 on Dec. 14, Covington will challenge UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman. The fight is a tossup in Askren\u2019s mind, but the Roufusport product is slightly leaning towards the champion to get the victory.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re actually very, very similar,\u201d Askren said. \u201cLike almost the same fighter. I think Marty (Usman) is a little bit better than Colby is. So I think \u2018Marty\u2019 wins. But again, hey, if they both get beat up really bad, I\u2019m not that sad about.\u201d\n\nGallery Photos: Ben Askren through the years view 89 images", "description": "Ben Askren has vocalized his disdain since Colby Covington began making a name for himself in the ranks of the UFC welterweight division.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner", "John Morgan", "Matt Erickson", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ben-askren-colby-covington.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
