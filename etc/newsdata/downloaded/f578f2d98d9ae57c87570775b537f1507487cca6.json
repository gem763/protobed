The LSE didn't dismiss it outright but called the bid \"unsolicited, preliminary and highly conditional\" and that it remained committed to its own deal, buying Refinitiv, that the Hong Kong exchange wants to halt.\n\n\"The proposal is a fascinating prospect, but far from a done deal. The fact that the LSE share price has already retreated from the initial 10% spike on release of the news may reflect some initial scepticism around the likelihood of the deal going through,\" said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\n\nU.K. stocks generally were well bid after China relaxed tariffs on U.S. products, helping to buoy sentiment for global stocks.\n\nThe FTSE 100 rose 1% to 7339.04.\n\nOther gainers included engine maker Rolls Royce (RR.LN) , which rose over 4%, as did builder Persimmon (PSN.LN) .\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 11, 2019 08:29 ET (12:29 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
