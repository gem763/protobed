It also accuses NBC News, where Farrow was working when he began investigating Weinstein, of trying to dissuade him from reporting on the Hollywood producer and later quashing the story. Farrow\u2019s story was eventually published by The New Yorker.\n\n\u201cFarrow takes the first false allegation \u2014 that we knew about Lauer\u2019s offenses \u2014 and uses it to sustain another, that we obstructed his reporting on Harvey Weinstein. Attached is the detailed accounting of that reporting, which we released in September 2018,\u201d Oppenheim wrote in his memo, referring to NBC\u2019s internal investigation of the matter following Lauer\u2019s firing. \u201cOnce, again, we stand by every word of it. In the meantime, Farrow\u2019s effort to defame NBC News is clearly motivated not by a pursuit of truth, but an axe to grind. It is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines, and outright inaccuracies.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFarrow has repeatedly stood by his reporting, saying that his book was extensively fact-checked and includes documentation for his claims.\n\n\u201cThese are now repeated claims made specifically by those with the most to lose from the truth,\u201d a representative for Farrow said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe stand by the reporting in the book, 100 percent, and believe that it discredits this attempt by NBC to rewrite the facts.\u201d\n\nResponding to Oppenheim\u2019s memo on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d on Monday, he accused NBC of defending itself with \u201cuntruths\u201d and \u201clies,\u201d arguing that the network\u2019s efforts demonstrate the larger pattern laid out in his book: powerful people and institutions trying to attack and obstruct reporters.\n\nFarrow\u2019s allegations of a cover-up have reportedly disturbed employees at NBC. At a Q&A session last week, they questioned Oppenheim about the network\u2019s handling of the rape allegation against Lauer. Staffers told CNN that the conversation was \u201cheated\u201d and \u201cthe most contentious exchange I have ever seen between staff and management.\u201d\n\nOppenheim has come under fire himself for sexist commentaries he wrote in college. NBC staffers circulated the Harvard Crimson columns last week, according to the Daily Beast. In one column, Oppenheim lamented the firing of NBC sportscaster Marv Albert in 1997 after he pleaded guilty to sexual assault. (Albert was later rehired.) In another, Oppenheim wrote that \u201capparently women enjoy being confined, pumped full of alcohol and preyed upon.\u201d\n\nIn a Los Angeles Times interview on Sunday, Oppenheim apologized for the Harvard columns, calling them \u201ctotally inappropriate.\u201d\n\nLauer has similarly launched a campaign against Farrow\u2019s book, denying the rape allegation in a lengthy open letter attacking Nevils, which she called \u201ca case study in victim blaming.\u201d", "description": "The book \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d accuses the network of covering up alleged serial sexual abuse by former \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer.", "authors": ["Marina Fang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4jveTmR6ZaduTqCFUlkDhw--~B/aD0zMzM1O3c9NDc2NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da49aa92100005009acd90e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
