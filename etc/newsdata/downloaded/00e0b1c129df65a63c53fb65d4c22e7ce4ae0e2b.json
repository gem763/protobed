The area sits between Ukraine and Belarus and used to be part of the Soviet Union. Humans have not returned to the zone or the nearby town of Pripyat\n\nThe University of Georgia's research team now hopes to conduct future research in the Ukraine section of the zone, where the population was initially introduced.\n\nFuture studies could gather information on population numbers.\n\nThe research team hope the research will help them learn more about the behavioural patterns of Przewalski's horses so they can save them.\n\nTourists can now visit the Unit 4 control room in Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukraine after a 36,000-tonne structure called a New Safe Confinement (NSC) shield, costing \u00a31.3 billion, was set up to seal in radioactive substances.\n\nReactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine exploded and burned on April 26, 1986, leading to thousands of premature deaths, hundreds of thousands of people being resettled and hundreds of billions of pounds worth of damage.\n\nThe blast showered radiation over the local area, including nearby regions of Belarus and other portions of Europe.\n\nDeaths from the long-term effects of the radiation poisoning total around 4,000, including those killed by the immediate blast.", "description": "Cameras captured over 11,000 images of rare Przewalski's horses living in abandoned barns in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Belarus.
