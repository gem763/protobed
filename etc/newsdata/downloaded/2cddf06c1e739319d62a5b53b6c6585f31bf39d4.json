Just because every single time I don\u2019t see nobody saying they love a Democratic candidate. There\u2019s no candidate that people are saying like we love, we want them to win.\u201d\n\nCardi has been an enthusiastic supporter of Bernie Sanders, and praised him on the podcast as \u201creally a person that cares\u201d \u2013 but her comments come as something of a surprise. This summer she sat down for an interview with Sanders as part of an effort to encourage young people to vote.\n\nOn the podcast, Cardi said she believed many of Trump\u2019s supporters had fallen for his hateful rhetoric and voted for him despite it not being in their best interests.\n\nShe said: \u201cEvery single time he always talk about how he wants to take away Medicare and shit like that. A poor white man that\u2019s getting Medicare is not even caring that he\u2019s saying that \u2013 he just cares that he hates Mexicans and he want to get rid of them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if Donald Trump take away the thing that I need, I just hate Mexicans and I want them gone. So I\u2019m going to keep on voting for them A lot of people vote with feelings in America and a lot of their feelings is racism and religion.\u201d\n\nShe also said she was pessimistic about the impeachment inquiry, saying Republican legislators themselves are too beholden to Trump to let it amount to anything meaningful.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate, Cardi said, \u201care the people that are letting Trump still not getting impeached. They don\u2019t want to lose their job. They don\u2019t want to lose their position.\u201d\n\nOn the podcast, she again praised Sanders, and added that she would like to be able to sit down with more of the candidates.\n\n\u201cI really want to do it with every candidate but I just didn\u2019t have time. I really wanted some of my fans to ask questions that they would like a candidate to answer. And I\u2019ve really been a fan of Bernie\u2019s for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI always felt like he was really passionate, and I had to ask him, \u2018A lot of people think that the things that you\u2019re going to do is not possible, you\u2019re too progressive, it\u2019s not possible.\u2019\u201d\n\nSanders won her over after their talk, she said, adding that he\u2019s \u201creally like a person that cares and I really want that. I want somebody that cares for, not just America, but everybody in America. Every person white. Every person of color, black, Hispanic, Muslim, everybody.\u201d", "description": "Rapper praises Bernie Sanders as \u2018really passionate \u2026 a person that cares\u2019 but says Trump\u2019s base will tip scales in his favor", "authors": ["Luke O'Neil"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9e3b686028e5936585c5623ad9b01a74bcbde96/0_0_4904_2941/master/4904.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b664f2ed463fe50b14f87b3974b11dea", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
