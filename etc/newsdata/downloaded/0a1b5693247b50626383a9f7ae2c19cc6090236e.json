Nina Funnell shares her story on the gruelling process.\n\nNBC News chief Andrew Lack \u2014 once accused of mishandling sexual harassment complaints at the Peacock Network \u2014 preyed on female underlings and pursued sexual relationships with them, according to one of his alleged victims.\n\nLack\u2019s alleged behaviour is detailed in Ronan Farrow\u2019s upcoming book Catch and Kill \u2014 an excerpt of which was obtained on Wednesday by The Post.\n\nIn it, Jane Wallace, an anchor on CBS\u2019s West 57th news show when Lack was an executive producer in the late 1980s, discussed her affair with the then-married news man.\n\nNBC\u2019s Andy Lack fires back at Ronan Farrow over Harvey Weinstein saga https://t.co/OQOkDkzjHx pic.twitter.com/grUxSgxaQ3 \u2014 Page Six (@PageSix) October 9, 2019\n\nLack, 72, a close friend of ousted Today show anchor Matt Lauer who oversaw his 2017 termination, was \u201calmost unrelenting\u201d in asking Wallace out to dinner \u201cevery day for almost a month\u201d, saying he wanted to celebrate her contract, according to the book.\n\n\u201cIf your boss does that, what are you gonna say?\u201d Wallace told Farrow. \u201cYou know if you say \u2018I don\u2019t want to celebrate with you\u2019, you\u2019re asking for trouble.\u201d\n\nShe said their sexual relationship was \u201cultimately consensual, but I didn\u2019t just get flirted with. I got worked over.\u201d\n\nEventually, Wallace claimed Lack bullied her out of the job she loved \u2014 and lorded his power over her \u2014 when their relationship soured.\n\n\u201cAs she left the show, she recalled him yelling, \u2018You will never get credit\u2019,\u201d Farrow wrote. \u201cThen the network deployed a tactic that the public was barely conscious of at the time: It offered her a substantial payout to sign a binding nondisclosure agreement.\u201d\n\nIt was an offer Wallace accepted \u2014 reluctantly.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t till I really got out of there that I felt the full force of it. Of how disgusted I was,\u201d Wallace told Farrow. \u201cThe truth is, if he hadn\u2019t been like that, I would have kept that job. I loved that job.\u201d\n\nLack also allegedly had a \u201crelationship\u201d with a young associate producer, Jennifer Laird, and turned \u201chostile\u201d towards her when things ended, according to the book.\n\n\u201cWhen Laird asked to be reassigned, Lack wouldn\u2019t allow it,\u201d Farrow wrote. \u201cHe compelled her to work longer hours, and on weekends, and proposed she cancel vacations.\u201d\n\nLaird confirmed the relationship to Farrow, telling the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a reason you don\u2019t get involved with your boss.\u201d\n\nIn the book, a rep denied Lack ever took retaliatory action against Laird.\n\nLack, whose first stint at NBC began in 1993, was brought back to helm NBC News in 2015 following the Brian Williams crisis.\n\nBut his return to the newsroom received pushback from some, Farrow wrote.\n\n\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d one executive recalled asking (NBCUniversal CEO) Steve Burke upon learning of his decision to reinstate Lack, the book notes. \u201cThe reason you have those cultural problems down there \u2014 he created that!\u201d\n\nLack was criticised last year over his handling of sexual misconduct allegations at NBC as well as when he was chairman and CEO of Sony BMG Music Entertainment in 2004, the Daily Beast reported.\n\nHe and wife Betsy Kenny separated in June, Page Six exclusively reported at the time.\n\nNBC declined to comment on Lack\u2019s behalf, and Lack could not be reached.\n\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Lia Eustachewich\n\nThis article originally appeared on the New York Post and was reproduced with permission", "description": "NBC News chief Andrew Lack \u2014 once accused of mishandling sexual harassment complaints at the Peacock Network \u2014 preyed on female underlings and pursued sexual relationships with them, according to one of his alleged victims.", "authors": ["Sara Nathan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2af65a8fe69c8f96d308a560a56f1623?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
