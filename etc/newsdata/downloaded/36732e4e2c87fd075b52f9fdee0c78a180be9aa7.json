REUTERS/Phil Noble/Files\n\nCurrency markets are also sticking to tight ranges ahead of key central bank meetings this week and next with the euro zone, Japan and United States due to review policy.\n\nSterling held at $1.2911 after Britain\u2019s parliament backed a withdrawal deal, but rejected the government\u2019s tight timetable, while European Union members delayed deciding whether to grant a three-month extension to the Oct. 31 leaving date.\n\nThe pound has soared 6% in two weeks of volatile trade since British Prime Minister Boris Johnson flagged and then clinched a deal with the EU on the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc.\n\n\u201cSterling remains at the centre of the focus for forex markets,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\n\u201cIt looks like traders are weighing up the current parliamentary shenanigans versus the seeming inevitability of a Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia analysts reckon the pound will stay rangebound between $1.3000 and $1.2800 until things become clearer.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said he recommended the leaders of the EU\u2019s 27 other member states back a delay, with senior EU diplomats saying a three-month delay is most likely.\n\nOther majors were stable without much news to move the greenback.\n\n\u201cWith trade negotiations now moving out of the headlines, there doesn\u2019t seem much to spur the dollar in either direction,\u201d CMC Market\u2019s McCarthy said.\n\nPositive comments from U.S. and Chinese leaders earlier in the week about progress negotiating a truce in a their trade dispute had rallied trade-exposed currencies.\n\nThat has begun to run out of steam as concerns about the health of the U.S. economy returned to the fore.\n\nTech industry bellwether Texas Instruments posted a disappointing earnings outlook on Tuesday, followed overnight by signs of a slowdown in Microsoft Corp\u2019s cloud computing division.\n\nTraders also await U.S. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s speech later in the day, after his strong criticism of China in a speech in October last year escalated bilateral tensions and triggered a global share selloff.\n\nFor now, the dollar was steady in Asian trade, gaining marginally against the Australian and New Zealand dollars while slipping marginally against the euro and Japanese yen.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the dollar was flat at 97.459.\n\nIt stood at 108.65 yen, and drifted higher from a five-week low touched against the kiwi on Tuesday, with the New Zealand dollar buying $0.6420. The Australian dollar bought $0.6851.\n\nThe Chinese yuan was flat at 7.0623 in offshore trade.\n\nThe euro held at $1.1132 with traders looking to euro zone manufacturing and services data and the outcome of a European Central Bank meeting, both due later on Thursday.\n\n\u201cSmall improvements across France, Germany and pan-Eurozone and for both manufacturing, services and composite readings are the consensus expectation,\u201d National Australia Bank\u2019s Head of FX Strategy, Ray Attrill, said in a note.\n\n\u201cEUR will be sensitive to deviations one side or the other of this.\u201d\n\nThe ECB is all but certain to leave policy unchanged on Thursday, six weeks after its last meeting at which it launched new asset purchases, a rate cut and a pledge to open the money taps further if needed.\n\nCrypto-currency bitcoin plunged as far as 11% overnight to a 5-month low of $7,258.00 after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sounded downbeat about the prospect of Facebook\u2019s crypto project, Libra.\n\nAlso weighing on the digital currency was the announcement from Google that it has achieved a breakthrough in research on a quantum computer.\n\nIf fully developed, a vast computing power of quantum computer is expected to obliterate existing cryptographic technologies.", "description": "The British pound stabilised on Thursday as the Brexit project entered a fresh holding pattern, while the dollar held firm as traders took a breather from Sino-U.S. trade headlines.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444355331&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N07X", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
