REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian lender Banco Inter SA and Uber Technologies Inc are in talks to forge a partnership in financial services, a source familiar with the matter said, in a move that shows how Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp is working to integrate its business in Latin America.\n\nSoftBank, which is a shareholder in Uber, acquired a roughly 15% stake in Banco Inter this year.\n\nThe partnership could target both Uber\u2019s drivers and Banco Inter\u2019s more than 3 million clients. The source declined to comment on the terms of any potential deal.\n\nAn agreement would likely boost Banco Inter\u2019s business, as Brazil is Uber\u2019s largest market outside the United States. S\u00e3o Paulo has more Uber rides than any other city in the world.\n\nIn Mexico, Uber struck a partnership with bank BBVA and payments processor Mastercard to launch a commission-free debit card for drivers in July.\n\nSoftBank, which in March launched a $5 billion Latin America fund, declined to comment. Banco Inter and Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe talks were first reported earlier on Sunday by Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo.", "description": "Brazilian lender Banco Inter SA and Uber Technologies Inc are in talks to forge a partnership in financial services, a source familiar with the matter said, in a move that shows how Japan's SoftBank Group Corp is working to integrate its business in Latin America.", "authors": ["Carolina Mandl", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440436686&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0K1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
