Rodimer isn\u2019t a political novice; he\u2019s run for state office before. And he has lined up the services of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer in his attempt to find his way to Congress.\n\nBut his campaign is still unconventional, if for no other reasons that not many candidates for federal office have been dogged by violent incidents at late-night food stops in which they reportedly boasted that they like to \u201cfuck\u201d people up.\n\nBack in 2011, Rodimer\u2014better known to WWE fans as Daniel Rodman before he left the wrestling organization in 2007\u2014was arrested at a Florida Waffle House for misdemeanor battery.\n\nRodimer, who is running to unseat Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), has portrayed himself in interviews as the victim of the incident, unjustly charged after he tried to defend a friend from bullies. He told the Nevada Independent during a failed state senate run in 2018 that he was arrested after he \u201cpushed a bully.\u201d And when he was interviewed about his congressional bid recently on Fox & Friends, he insisted that he was simply standing up for a friend who was being threatened by a gang of bullies who were inexplicably mad that the friend was wearing Rodimer\u2019s old wrestling outfit as a Halloween costume.\n\n\u201cOn Halloween, I was dressed up and one of my little buddies at law school, he was dressed up in my WWE outfit,\u201d Rodimer said. \u201cAnd sure enough, three or four guys started, you know, picking on him, pushing him around. Sure enough, I walked over just tried to stop it, and the guy started pointing at me, pointing at me. I\u2019m looking at the guy, I\u2019m like, \u2018Really?\u2019 And shirt up, just a shove, that was about it. But my shove\u2019s a big shove.\u201d\n\nBut police records and sworn witness statements reviewed by The Daily Beast reflect an incident almost entirely at odds with Rodimer\u2019s depiction of the incident. According to the documents, Rodimer was at a Waffle House in Naples, Florida, near his law school\u2014the conservative Ave Maria\u2014early in the morning of Nov. 1, 2010. Around 2:30 a.m., Rodimer began to bother a group of women at the restaurant, according to a statement from one of the women, who described Rodimer as \u201ca large man with a boisterous attitude.\u201d Rodimer was \u201charassing\u201d the women, according to the police report.\n\nRodimer\u2014then 32, and just three years out from the stalled WWE career that one sports blog described as one of WWE\u2019s biggest \u201csuperstar busts\u201d\u2014stood a hefty 6 foot 7 inches and weighed 270 pounds. When a male friend of the women asked Rodimer to stop bothering them, Rodimer allegedly threw the man into a chair and onto the ground.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked him to leave the girls at our table alone and to please just move on, he grabbed me by the neck and threw me into a chair and onto the floor,\u201d Rodimer\u2019s victim told police in a statement.\n\n\u201c When I asked him to leave the girls at our table alone and to please just move on, he grabbed me by the neck and threw me into a chair and onto the floor. \u201d \u2014 Police statement\n\nThat description is backed up by a witness statement from one of the women, who told police a \u201cpossibly intoxicated\u201d Rodimer grabbed her friend \u201cby the neck harshly and threw him into the ground.\u201d Rodimer\u2019s victim had \u201cfresh red marks all around the back of his neck area,\u201d according to the police report.\n\nAfter the attack, Rodimer allegedly made even more of a scene, according to the witnesses. One of the alleged victims claimed that Rodimer challenged him to a fight, with Rodimer boasting that he liked to \u201cfuck\u201d people up. Two of Rodimer\u2019s friends and a Waffle House employee eventually convinced Rodimer to leave the restaurant.\n\nBefore he left the Waffle House, Rodimer purportedly threw down a business card with his name and face on it\u2014a clue police would later use to tie him to the attack\u2014and then boasted about how much he liked \u201churting people,\u201d according to the police report.\n\n\u201cAs Dan was leaving the restaurant he was using profanity and stated how much he enjoys hurting people,\u201d the police report reads.\n\nA warrant for Rodimer\u2019s arrest was issued six months later, in May 2011, and Rodimer was arrested in August 2011. In exchange for a deferred prosecution agreement that required him to go through an anger-management course, the charge was eventually dropped.\n\nIn a statement, Rodimer\u2019s campaign described the Waffle House incident as \u201cunfortunate,\u201d but didn\u2019t dispute the versions offered by witnesses and in the police statement or deny that Rodimer said he likes to \u201cfuck\u201d people up.\n\n\u201cAlmost a decade ago Dan was involved in an unfortunate incident that he regrets happened,\u201d Make no mistake about it\u2014he got into this race to stand up for working families, small businesses, and his greater community in Nevada.\u201d\n\nEight years after the incident, Rodimer has rebranded himself as a rough-and-tumble Nevada Republican. After narrowly losing the Republican primary for a state senate seat in 2018, he has launched a bid for Lee\u2019s House seat in Nevada\u2019s 3rd District\u2014a battleground race that Cook Political Report ranks as \u201cLean Democratic.\u201d He\u2019ll face a former state treasurer and at least two other candidates in the primary.\n\nPitching his campaign to voters, Rodimer has used wrestling-style trash talk that gets new relevance in light of his Waffle House arrest. In his Fox & Friends appearance, Rodimer vowed to team up wrestling-style with Trump and take on the capital city.\n\n\u201cBetween the two of us, I think we can get up there and knock some sense into Washington, D.C.\u201d Rodimer said.", "description": "Dan Rodimer is promising to shake up D.C. and has hired Sean Spicer to get him elected.
