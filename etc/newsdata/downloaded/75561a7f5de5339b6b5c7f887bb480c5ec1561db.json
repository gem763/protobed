An equal amount in the middle quintile had balances below $50,000 \u2013 though 56 percent had a retirement account.\n\nOn the flip side, 50 percent of Americans in the top quintile had account balances in excess of $500,000.\n\nOverall, 42 percent of Americans reported having no retirement savings at all, according to a 2018 survey from the Center for Financial Services Innovation.\n\nAn analysis into savings is important at a time when Baby Boomers are both retiring and living longer lives \u2013 by 2030 one in three Americans will be aged 55 or older.\n\nThe study found that Americans in the bottom 20 percent will rely more heavily on Social Security benefits as a source of financial security in retirement \u2013 compared to the top two quintiles of Americans who depend primarily on wealth.\n\nBut the Social Security trust fund will only be able to pay about 77 percent of benefits by 2034 \u2013 unless action is taken in Congress.\n\nLonger lives are also leading to increased health care costs, According to a recent study conducted by financial services firm Fidelity Investments, a 65-year old couple retiring this year will spend about $285,000 in health care and medical expenses throughout retirement \u2013 and that assumes both individuals are eligible for Medicare coverage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nCongress is aware of the retirement savings challenge. House lawmakers have advanced a retirement bill that would make retirement plans even more accessible to workers. The legislation would make it easier for small businesses to band together to offer multi-employer plans, while requiring businesses to allow some part-time workers to participate. The bill still needs to be taken up by the Senate.", "description": "Many still have account balances below $50,000.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/11/0/0/retirement-coin-jar2-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
