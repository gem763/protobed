Instead of appealing the decision, CMS should rethink how the Medicare program can become a prudent purchaser of health-care services.\n\nThe Medicare site-neutral payments were based on a 2012 MedPAC recommendation that CMS made payments the same between higher paid hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) and lesser-paid freestanding physician offices.\n\nMedPAC rationalized its recommendation by arguing, \u201cif the same service can be safely provided in different settings, it may be undesirable for a prudent purchaser to pay more for that service in one setting than in another.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2015, Congress largely adopted MedPAC\u2019s recommendation under Section 603 of the 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) .\n\nSince 2015, MedPAC, presidential executive orders, the president\u2019s budget and various think tanks have all called for expanding site neutrality beyond off-campus to on-campus outpatient departments, and beyond. With such unanimity of opinion, site neutrality has become a sine qua non payment policy.\n\nAs a result, last year CMS chose to expand site neutral payments to include HOPDs the Congress accepted in 2015 by exploiting a different Medicare statute and do so in a manner that produces Medicare savings.\n\nMedPAC\u2019s 2012 recommendation was based on the assumption that the payment differential caused hospitals to hire more primary care physicians led to unnecessary increases in HOPD volume.\n\nCMS reflected this reasoning in its final 2019 outpatient rule stating, \u201cwe believe that this [HOPD] volume growth . . . is unnecessary because it appears to have been incentivized by the difference in payment for each setting rather than patient acuity.\u201d The policy is problematic for six reasons.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFirst, it constitutes circular reasoning.\n\nSecond, policymakers presented no convincing supportive evidence. The use of over 20 \u201cwe believe\u201d statements in CMS\u2019 2019 final out patient rule\u2019s site neutral-related discussion made this evident. CMS did cite a 2015 GAO study to support its expanded policy. Though CMS presented GAO\u2019s study as determinative, it was inconclusive.\n\nFor example, the GAO found that while the median number of office visits per 100 beneficiaries performed in HOPDs was higher in high vertical consolidated counties compared to low consolidated counties, the median number of total office visits per 100 beneficiaries was lower in higher vertical consolidated counties. In addition, the GAO admitted the report did not include \u201ca full analysis of the causes or the appropriateness of vertical consolidation between hospitals and physicians.\u201d\n\nThird, while CMS presented no clear evidence for site neutrality, there is evidence against. For example, in a 2015 study published by the Healthcare Financial Management Association researchers identified high, mid and low-value or spending efficient on- and off-campus HOPDs.\n\nUsing MedPAC\u2019s 2012 model for equalizing payments, they concluded 186 high-impact hospitals, 10 percent of all hospitals studied, would assume 56 percent of total payment reductions. The researchers also found high impact hospitals also disproportionately treated indigent or underserved patients.\n\nThey concluded, \u201cIf the outpatient payment equalization policy were enacted, hospitals with a high percentage of uncompensated care would be disproportionately affected and could be forced to change their business model.\u201d That is, the policy would not only lead to disproportionately distributing payment cuts but also effectively lead to a reverse Robin Hood effect.\n\nFourth, concerning patient acuity, while the GAO found beneficiaries in counties with high levels of vertical consolidation were not comparatively sicker, the GAO made clear this did not mean HOPD-treated patients were not sicker than those freestanding physician offices treated.\n\nThere is evidence to support that they are. An April, KNG Health Consulting report found when compared to ambulatory surgical centers, HOPD patients were more likely to be dual eligible, from lower income areas, minorities, suffer higher acuity or burdened with more severe chronic conditions and more likely to be previously hospitalized.\n\nFifth, even MedPAC admitted in 2012 hospitals were likely acquiring physician practices for unrelated reasons including, as MedPAC noted, \u201cpositioning themselves to establish ACOs.\u201d MedPAC also recognized site neutral payments \u201cwould fail to account for some important differences between physician offices and [H]OPDs\u201d such as the latter maintaining standby emergency capacity and complying with additional regulatory requirements such as EMTALA.\n\nRecently, MedPAC in its September response to CMS\u2019 proposed 2020 outpatient rule, largely unwound its 2012 recommendation by arguing HOPD site neutral payments first meet five criteria including: patient severity is no greater in HOPDs than in freestanding offices; and, the HOPD visit is not frequently associated with an emergency department visit.\n\nSixth, in its recent March report to Congress, MedPAC stated, \u201cMedicare\u2019s goal should be to obtain the greatest possible value for the program\u2019s expenditures.\u201d \u201cManaging payment rates,\u201d MedPAC wrote,\u201d alone will not address the Medicare FFS system\u2019s key challenge . . . [that providers] are usually not held accountable for outcomes.\u201d \u201cThe Congress and the Secretary . . . [must] move the Medicare program beyond just blindly paying FFS rates.\u201d\n\nInstead of persisting with site neutrality that does nothing to hold Medicare providers accountable for outcomes and epitomizes \u201cblindly paying FFS rates,\u201d policymakers should work to rapidly expand nascent efforts to pay for value or spending efficiency \u2014 defined as outcomes achieved relative to spending.\n\nDriving spending efficiency is not lost on CMS as made evident by the agency\u2019s recent proposal to create MIPS Value Pathways that would measure \u2014 and reward \u2014 quality as related to cost. Policymakers should know site neutrality payments are incapable of moving the Medicare program in this direction because the policy does nothing to eradicate suboptimal value.\n\nIf Medicare policymakers want to control for unnecessary service volume along with reducing spending growth, spurring competition and redressing market consolidation, payments should incentivize providers to compete for spending efficiency.\n\nDavid Introcaso, Ph.D., is the vice president of regulatory policy at Strategic Health Care.
