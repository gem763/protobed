USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 The arena scoreboard displayed one of this city\u2019s biggest stars.\n\nThat moment should have prompted legions of fans to welcome Clippers newcomer Kawhi Leonard as he attended a recent NFL game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams. Instead, he was booed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really notice it at first. I thought it was just Buccaneers fans,\u201d Leonard told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThere were a lot of Buccaneers fans.\u201d\n\nThere were a lot of Lakers fans, too. Since the vast majority of fans here root for the Lakers, they welcomed Leonard with jeers instead of cheers. Not only did those fans become upset at Leonard for declining the Lakers\u2019 free-agent pitches last summer, they expressed displeasure that Leonard left the reigning NBA champion Toronto Raptors for the Clippers instead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not new to me. It\u2019s like second nature,\u201d said Leonard, who professed to be a Clippers fan as a child living in Moreno Valley. \u201cI grew up in a household full of Lakers fans.\u201d\n\nLeonard plans to host a handful of family members for every Clippers game. That begins with the season opener Tuesday against the Lakers at Staples Center (10:30 p.m. ET, TNT) .\n\nKawhi Leonard, who grew up just outside Los Angeles, says he is used to being booed so Lakers fans won't rattle him.

Perhaps that heightens with the Lakers and Clippers considered NBA championship contenders. That might depend on how the Lakers and Clippers fare in a possible playoff matchup.\n\n\u201cEvery time I post something on Instagram, I get a comment saying \u201c\u2018Lakers in 4!\u2019\u201d Clippers center JaMychal Green said. \u201cSometimes I go back and forth with them. But the majority of the time, I just delete the comments. I don\u2019t want to deal with them.\u201d\n\nAnd why would they? As Lakers coach Frank Vogel said, \u201cthe Lakers fanbase is like a religion around here.\u201d\n\nTwo different Hollywood stories\n\nThe Lakers have built a global following for three reasons: they won a combined 16 NBA championships; they brought in the \u201cShowtime Era\u201d - an exciting run-and-gun style; they became a destination for superstars, including Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Gail Goodrich, Elgin Baylor, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe Clippers do not have the same championship equity.\n\nThey once became a laughingstock because embattled owner Donald Sterling remained more obsessed with his profit margins than hiring and retaining quality coaches and players. Their fortunes changed when they drafted Blake Griffin at No. 1 in the 2010 draft and then when they acquired Chris Paul from New Orleans in 2011 after the NBA rejected the original deal to the Lakers. When the NBA removed Sterling as owner in 2014 for making racist comments on a leaked audio tape, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer eventually bought the team. While the Lakers missed six consecutive playoff appearances, though, the Clippers failed to advance past the first round.\n\nStory continues below video:\n\nCLOSE USA TODAY Sports' Trysta Krick and Mark Medina break down the questions entering this season for the Los Angeles Lakers. USA TODAY\n\nThis season could be very different. The Lakers and Clippers might have actual bragging rights at stake.\n\nWhile the Lakers have LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Clippers have two stars that rejected the Lakers. Along with Leonard, the Clippers acquired Paul George from Oklahoma City a year after he rejected the Lakers\u2019 free-agent pitches. Paul, who grew up in nearby Palmdale, received boos last season when the Thunder played the Lakers in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cYou want to prove you\u2019re the better team in the city,\u201d said Clippers center Ivica Zubac, who played with the Lakers from 2016 to 2018. \u201cWe would always get instructions from the front office and coaches: \u2018Please beat the Clippers; we don\u2019t like them.\u2019 That\u2019s how it used to be. Now it\u2019s the other way around.\u201d\n\nSaid Lakers forward Avery Bradley, who played for the Clippers last season: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than having a rivalry in the same city. With the teams they\u2019ve been able to put together, I think it\u2019s great for the city and for the fans. It\u2019s going to be great for us to go out there and compete against them. It's some of the best players in the NBA.\u201d\n\nStill, the Lakers and Clippers stress they are making little of this story line.As Bradley said, \u201cthe goal is to win a championship, not worry about the Clippers.\u201d\n\nThat will not stop Lakers fans from trolling the Clippers. They booed Paul when he threw out a first pitch at Dodger Stadium in the 2013-14 season. They jeered George last month when he attended a Bellator mixed martial arts event at the Forum. Guard Jerome Robinson recalled a Lakers fan booed him after learning he played for the Clippers when the two crossed paths at his apartment complex.\n\n\u201cIt happens all the time,\u201d Clippers guard Terance Mann said, with a laugh. \u201cPeople say they\u2019re kind of mean and all that. But they\u2019re not that mean. They just say a few things about LeBron and stuff like that.\u201d\n\n'Hype is building'\n\nWhen coach Doc Rivers arrived with the Clippers in 2014, he met conflicted responses. He had coached the hated Boston Celtics, which included splitting an NBA Finals with the Lakers (2008, 2010). So Rivers said that Lakers fans often greeted him differently.\n\nSome said, \u201cit\u2019s tough to like you; you\u2019re from Boston.\u201d Others expressed appreciation Rivers at least left the Celtics. Others confessed to Rivers, \u201cI\u2019m a Lakers fan, but I\u2019m from L.A. and respect the Clippers.\u201d\n\nThey become relatively more friendly toward Zubac, whom the Lakers dealt before last season\u2019s trade deadline for Mike Muscala. So after Lakers fans take a picture with Zubac, he said they often lament, \u201cI wish they never traded you.\u201d Zubac added others have conceded, \u201cyou\u2019re the first Clipper player that I like.\u201d\n\nClippers players say most of the interactions take place on social media. As guard Lou Williams mused, \"nobody has the heart to walk up to me and say some of the things that they say online.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's exciting for the fans; for us it's just another game,\u201d said Williams, who also played for the Lakers from 2015 to 2017. \u201cObviously the hype is building up and it's all of this hoopla about this game. But it's just opening night for both teams. I don't think either team will put extra emphasis on it.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and other Clippers say they are used to taunts and booing from Lakers fans, who are \"like a religion\" in Tinseltown.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published A.M.
