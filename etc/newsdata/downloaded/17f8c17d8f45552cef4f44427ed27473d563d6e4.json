Before the military action in Syria, Turkey and the US said they aimed to boost that to $100bn in annual trade.\n\nInanc Sozer, chief economist at Turkey Macroview Consulting, said given the sanctions threat he would consider zero economic growth this year a \"success\".\n\n\"But if the US implements sanctions next year, we will be talking about a contraction again, which may be around 5 percent,\" he said.\n\n\"The economy is very fragile and its financial markets have been weak since last year. Sanctions may create a feedback loop that would put manufacturers under severe pressure,\" Sozer said.\n\nTurkey's calendar-adjusted industrial output, largely viewed as a pre-cursor to growth figures, declined 3.6 percent year-on-year in August, more than expected, data showed on Monday.\n\nData from IHS Markit showed Turkish five-year credit default swaps (CDS) - which investors and traders use as protection - rose 11 basis points to 404 basis points.\n\nSanctions, embargoes\n\nOn Friday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that Trump had authorised \"very powerful\" sanctions targeting Turkey. Turkey said it would retaliate in kind.\n\nBut in Istanbul on Sunday, Erdogan was quoted as saying at a closed-door meeting with some media outlets that he expected such talk. \"Of course things such as economic sanctions are being mentioned. Truthfully, I see those as quips along this process,\" he said, according to the state-run Anadolu agency.\n\nThe EU has condemned Turkey's military attack. On Monday France's foreign minister said it must call for \"a firm position\" establishing an arms embargo.\n\nIn Geneva, Turkish ambassador Sadik Arslan told reporters: \"That arms embargo is a joke,\" adding that Turkey has \"enough of an industrial base to substitute them with our much better systems.\"\n\nIt was unclear exactly what sanctions are in a US Treasury order drafted last week. But Senate and House legislators have proposed targeting Turkish individuals, banks and its defence sector.", "description": "Investors doubt that tough talk from US and Europe to punish Ankara economically over Syria will translate into action.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/bfcc970678424cd4af2b32577a21ad26_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
