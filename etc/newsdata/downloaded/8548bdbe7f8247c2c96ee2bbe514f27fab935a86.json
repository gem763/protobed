That\u2019s huge,\u201d said Steven Aden, chief legal officer and general counsel for Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion legal group.\n\nTheir nominations were fiercely fought by abortion-rights activists, who saw them as a threat to Roe v. Wade and other decisions the Supreme Court has made over the years in favor of abortion access.\n\nAnti-abortion groups, meanwhile, enthusiastically supported Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and now see their presence on the bench as the best opportunity in decades for scaling back abortion rights.\n\nTrump\u2019s two picks will be in the spotlight this term when the court decides whether to overturn or uphold a Louisiana law that would require abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals \u2014 a requirement opponents view as an effort to force the closure of abortion clinics.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2016 struck down a similar Texas law in Whole Women\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. Justices said in the 5-3 ruling that admitting privilege requirements posed obstacles to abortion access and created an \u201cundue burden\u201d for women.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut that ruling came at a time when the court had only eight justices following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. It was also before the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote who often sided with the court\u2019s liberal wing on abortion.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch \u2014 both former circuit court judges \u2014 will land on the abortion issue; neither has ruled on such a case before.\n\nBut the other conservative justices \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito Samuel AlitoSupreme Court to hear Louisiana abortion case Overnight Defense: Esper sworn in as Pentagon chief | Confirmed in 90-8 vote | Takes helm as Trump juggles foreign policy challenges | Senators meet with woman accusing defense nominee of sexual assault Esper sworn in as Pentagon chief MORE and Justice Clarence Thomas Clarence ThomasSupreme Court to hear Louisiana abortion case During impeachment storm, senators cross aisle to lessen mass incarceration Clarence Thomas, Joe Manchin, Rudy Giuliani among guests at second state visit under Trump MORE \u2014 dissented in the Texas case.\n\nAnti-abortion activists interpreted that ruling as a good sign the Supreme Court would take up the Louisiana case.\n\n\u201cI think the justices took the case because the majority or plurality of them want to again address abortion regulations and, in my estimation, pare back on the high-water mark for abortion rights that the Hellerstedt case from Texas represents,\u201d Aden said.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in February to temporarily block the Louisiana law from taking effect. Roberts sided with the liberal wing and Kavanaugh and Gorsuch joined Alito and Thomas in dissenting.\n\nKavanaugh wrote in his dissent that he would have denied the stay without prejudice because the law hadn\u2019t taken effect yet.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a reliable indicator for how the justices would vote after hearing oral arguments in the case.\n\nAbortion-rights groups expect the court to strike down the Louisiana law, arguing that to do otherwise would mean the Supreme Court going against its own precedent.\n\n\u201cCertainly we\u2019re concerned with the makeup of the court, but the law is unconstitutional. Under its own precedent, there should be no other possible outcome,\u201d said Heather Schumaker, senior counsel for reproductive rights and health for the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nThe 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Louisiana law last year in a 2-1 vote, ruling it \u201cdoes not impose a substantial burden on a large fraction of women.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs \u2014 June Medical Services, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights \u2014 appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile abortion-rights advocates have been anxiously awaiting the court\u2019s first abortion case after the addition of two conservative justices, they wanted the Supreme Court to take up the Louisiana challenge.\n\nThat\u2019s because it would have otherwise gone into effect.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even be in this situation\u2026 if the 5th Circuit hadn\u2019t completely disregarded the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent,\" Schumaker said.\n\nAnti-abortion advocates also wanted the court to take the case, but because they think the 2016 decision was too broad.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is likely to come in June or July, just months before the presidential election.\n\nPlanned Parenthood sent fundraising emails to supporters on Friday, writing: \u201cThis case could decide the future of abortion access in this country.\u201d\n\nSen.
