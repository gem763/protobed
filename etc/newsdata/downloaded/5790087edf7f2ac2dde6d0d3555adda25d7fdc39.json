Three designs are being considered, the most radical of which is an all-green plate.\n\nIf approved, it will be the first major change in plate design since 1969, when silver-on-black plates were replaced with today\u2019s yellow and white reflective versions.\n\nThe above number plate has been designed specifically for zero-emission cars and could benefit drivers\n\nThe other two proposed designs feature a green stripe and green dot on the traditional plate.\n\nMinisters have launched a 12-week consultation on the plans with a view to introducing green plates within 12 to 18 months.\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \u2018The UK is in the driving seat of global efforts to tackle vehicle emissions and climate change and improve air quality, but we want to accelerate our progress.\n\n\u2018Green number plates are a really positive and exciting way to help everyone recognise the increasing number of electric vehicles on our roads.\u2019\n\nThe new number plates could either by completely green or could feature just a green dot (as above)\n\nThe number plates could inspire road users to drive in a more environmentally friendly way\n\nThe plan is modelled on a trial in Ontario, Canada, where drivers of electric vehicles were given free access to toll roads and high-occupancy vehicle lanes, resulting in a spike in electric vehicle registrations.\n\nElisabeth Costa, senior director at the Behavioural Insights Team, which is part-owned by the Cabinet Office, said: \u2018The number of clean vehicles on our roads is increasing but we don\u2019t notice as it\u2019s difficult to tell clean vehicles apart from more polluting ones.\n\n\u2018Green number plates make these vehicles, and our decision to drive in a more environmentally friendly way, more visible on roads.\n\n'We think making the changing social norm noticeable will help encourage more of us to swap our cars for cleaner options.\u2019\n\nThe DfT's green number plate consultation document revealed the three designs being considered for electric cars\n\nHow can we best encourage zero-emission vehicles?

Displaying a green plate allows them to park for free in Budapest\n\nIf the plans are to go ahead, the UK wouldn't be the first European nation to introduce green plates for green vehicles.\n\nSince October 2015 the Hungarian government has allowed owners of plug-in hybrids and electric cars that meet certain criteria to request for their vehicles to be fitted with green plates.\n\nDrivers of these cars enjoy additional benefits of displaying the plates, including free parking in Budapest and some other cities.\n\nMike Hawes, chief executive at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the UK automotive industry 'welcomes all initiatives' that boost the popularity of electric vehicles, including green plates.\n\n'Increasing consumer awareness will help but to encourage the uptake of these vehicles to truly meaningful numbers, we need world-class measures including a long-term commitment from government to fiscal and other financial incentives and substantial investment in infrastructure,' he said.\n\n'The range of zero and ultra low emission vehicles is increasing rapidly to ensure all drivers will have a vehicle that meets their needs.'", "description": "Drivers of electric cars in the UK could be given green number plates that allow them to use bus lanes and park for free.
