To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in,\" he wrote in a statement published Tuesday on their official website.\n\nPrince Harry compared the media treatment of Duchess Meghan to that of his late mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while evading paparazzi.\n\n\"My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\" he wrote. \"I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\n\nFollowing the publishing of a private letter, the royals are suing Associated Newspapers, which owns The Mail on Sunday for the misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018, according to the statement. Any damages rewarded \"will be donated to an anti-bullying charity,\" they added.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday newspaper said in a statement to the Associated Press Tuesday night that it will defend itself \"vigorously\" against the lawsuit and \u201cstands by the story\u201d in question, which concerns publication of a letter Meghan had written to her estranged father.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we categorically deny that the duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning,\u201d the tabloid said in a statement.\n\nDuchess Meghan, Prince Harry call for unity, action on final day of Africa tour\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/04/prince-harry-rejects-reporter-questions/3862619002/", "description": "Prince Harry rebuffed a reporter's questions while in\u00a0Malawi earlier this week.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Cydney Henderson", "Published A.M.
