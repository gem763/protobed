Sathya Narayanan\n\nOct 10 (Reuters) - Gold prices retreated from a one-week\n\npeak on Thursday, while palladium prices marked an all-time\n\nhigh, after a report suggested that China wants to reach an\n\nagreement with the United States to avoid further escalation of\n\na ongoing trade row.\n\nSpot gold fell 0.6% to $1,497.01 per ounce by 01:51\n\np.m. EDT (1751 GMT), having earlier hit a one-week high.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 settled down 0.8% at $1,500.90 an\n\nounce.\n\n\"It is all about the tariffs. It is the he-said-she-said\n\nthat whips the market back and forth. Right now you have the\n\nshort-term traders selling gold on the tariff news,\" said\n\nMichael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He said that Beijing is willing to\n\nreach an agreement with the Washington on matters both sides\n\ncare about, China's Xinhua state news agency reported.\n\nEarlier, gold rose to $1,516.77 - its highest since Oct. 3 -\n\non a report that the Chinese delegation was planning to leave\n\nWashington after just a day of minister-level meetings, a day\n\nearlier than expected.\n\nTrade talks between the two countries started on Thursday.\n\nMarkets have been on edge for months over the U.S.-China\n\ntrade tensions. If negotiations break down again, nearly all\n\nChinese goods imports into the United States - more than $500\n\nbillion - could be subject to punitive tariffs by Dec. 15.\n\nThe major concern is that nothing is going to come out of\n\nthese negotiations, just kicking the can further down the road,\n\naccording to Daniel Pavilonis, senior market strategist at RJO\n\nFutures.\n\n\"So, if there is some type of an agreement, depending on\n\nwhat type of agreement it is, you would probably see a gold\n\nsell-off, at least that would be the initial reaction,\"\n\nPavilonis said, adding \"gold and silver, from a technical\n\nstandpoint, look pretty bullish.\"\n\nPalladium XPD= was 0.9% higher at $1,697.62, having hit a\n\nrecord $1,704.59.\n\n\"For palladium, heightening (U.S.-China) tensions had\n\nactually weighed but prices have remained elevated as the market\n\nwas undersupplied,\" said Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at\n\nStandard Chartered Bank.\n\nHowever, \"as we had some positive trade developments\n\n(today), that has helped to support sentiment for more industry\n\nbuyers.\"\n\nShe added that inflows into exchange-traded funds suggested\n\nthere was incremental demand for palladium but speculators could\n\ndrive price fluctuations in the near term.\n\nPlatinum XPT= rose 1% to $900.84 an ounce, while silver\n\nfell 1% to $17.53 per ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold slides, palladium hits record high on trade deal hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1Q06W_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
