It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for me,\" Fury said.\n\n\u201cSomething I\u2019ve dreamed of as a lifelong WWE fan.\n\n\u201cI just want to say how excited I am to be fighting the monster among men, Braun Strowman.\n\n\u201cAfter seeing him I really know why he\u2019s got the nickname the monster among men.\n\n\u201cBut me being the undefeated lineal heavyweight boxing champion, I fear no man.\n\n(Image: WWE/Youtube)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m undefeated in 30 professional contests. When I go to Saudi Arabia to fight Braun Strowman I\u2019m still going to be undefeated, because I\u2019m going to knock Braun Strowman out.\n\n\u201cHe talks about how good his hands are, but he\u2019s messing with the man with the best hands in boxing. He don\u2019t want none of them hands, let me tell you that.\u201d\n\nStrowman added: \"Tyson Fury is a bad dude, especially when you take into consideration what he has overcome.\n\n\"But in WWE, we don't wear gloves, you are coming into my world.\"\n\n(Image: WWE)\n\nThe Crown Jewel event will be shown on the FOX TV channel which will also broadcast Fury's second instalment with Wilder.\n\nThe desert show will also feature Cain Velasquez and Brock Lesnar who will renew their rivalry nine years after Velasquez KO'd Lesnar at UFC 121.\n\nVelasquez dethroned Lesnar as the UFC's heavyweight champion and confronted his old foe last Friday.\n\nOn Fury's fight, legendary boxing promoter Bob Arum said: \"Tyson Fury, the Gypsy King, he\u2019s not only a great fighter, he reminds me of Muhammad Ali, George Foreman.\n\n(Image: WWE)\n\n\"He entertains in the ring and he is a tremendous personality.\n\n\"He is a real showman, and that\u2019s why people love him. They know that he fights with his heart on his sleeve.\n\n\"And even though he had a big cut over his eye and blood streaming down his face, so he can\u2019t really see his opponent, he carries on to victory.\"", "description": "Fury confronted Strowman on Monday night following a row the previous Friday - and now the fight is on", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Wwe Youtube", "Wwe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563167.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_WWE-Press-Conference-w-Tyson-Fury-Brock-Lesnar-Cain-Velasquez-Braun-Strowman-Media-Assets.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
