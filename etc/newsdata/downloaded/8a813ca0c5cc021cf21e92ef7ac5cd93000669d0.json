She wanted a fresh start, as she says in the trailer, and she quickly learns she isn\u2019t \u201cthe only dame looking for emancipation.\u201d Along with her newfound friends, Harley will take on Gotham City in a way she hasn\u2019t before.\n\nBirds of Prey, also known as Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), follows Harley (Margot Robbie, reprising her Suicide Squad role) as she teams up with fellow superheroes Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), plus detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), to save Cassandra Cain (one of several characters who took on the role of Batgirl in DC\u2019s comics) (played by Ella Jay Basco) from Black Mask, a ruthless crime lord who operates out of Gotham City.\n\nRobbie originally pitched the idea of doing a Harley Quinn spinoff in 2015, just before Suicide Squad came out. Although the new film is tied to Suicide Squad, it doesn\u2019t seem like any of the major characters from David Ayer\u2019s film will appear or have major roles in Birds of Prey, including Jared Leto\u2019s Joker. It\u2019s also a part of the greater DC Extended Universe (DCEU), but it doesn\u2019t connect to the Justice League films (including Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Wonder Woman, Justice League, and Aquaman). Like Warner Bros.\u2019 upcoming Joker, Birds of Prey is meant as a standalone film.\n\nBirds of Prey will be released on February 7th, 2020.", "description": "It\u2019s Harley Quinn\u2019s time to shine in the first trailer for Birds of Prey, a companion movie to Warner Bros.\u2019 2016 Suicide Squad, which follows Margot Robbie\u2019s Harley Quinn after her emancipation from Joker.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pD49ghB5YtwvAtJ4bnFzXBadKfA=/44x0:1893x968/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19246754/birds.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
