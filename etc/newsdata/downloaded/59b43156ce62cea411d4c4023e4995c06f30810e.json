But even when you go through all the steps to wipe your account, the odds are high that Facebook still has deep caches of all your user data, which is can still use. Better than simply deleting your account is to replace all that data with nonsense, and if you\u2019re savvy with code, you can do just that.\n\nKevin Matthew, a former systems administrator who owns a small web development company, shared a script he created that replaces existing Facebook posts with randomly-generated nonsense. With a little coding know-how, you could use this script to repeatedly mangle all your Facebook posts over a period of several months, to make the bulk of Facebook\u2019s data on you virtually unusable (though it doesn\u2019t do anything for the data that\u2019s already been scraped by third-parties, like the kind Cambridge Analytica allegedly gained access to).\n\nMatthew said his script is simply a proof of concept, because actually doing this may be in violation of Facebook\u2019s terms of service (so use at your own risk).\n\nImage: courtesy Kevin Matthew\n\n\u201cMy background is as a systems administrator, I\u2019ve been doing that for 20 years, and everyone has data retention policies and backups,\u201d Matthew told me over the phone. \u201cFacebook, with its infinite amount of resources, I can only begin to imagine how that data is being held and retained.\u201d\n\nMatthew\u2019s script automatically opens Facebook posts to edit and replaced them with randomly-generated text. The idea is that if you ran the script 100s, or 1000s of times, over the course of several months, on all of your data, it would likely make it more difficult for Facebook\u2019s algorithms to pull useful data it uses to build a profile of you, including your political leanings and sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cEvery little bit of information contributes to that invisible profile that they\u2019re building of everyone,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cIf we can obfuscate it even a little bit, that at least puts the power back into your hands as an end user.\u201d\n\nThough so far he\u2019s only done a proof of concept for posts, going forward Matthew said it would be possible to build similar scripts to \u201cpoison\u201d the rest of your Facebook data, such as tracking which websites you visit by having a script visit thousands of random sites while you\u2019re logged into your account. To make it more accessible for non-coders, it would also be possible to create a desktop-based app that would run all the scripts for the average user.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how far back Facebook\u2019s history of data on its users extends, how that data is stored and backed up, but this is one way to at least make an attempt at sticking it to the platform before you leave it forever.\n\nMatthew told me his main goal, though, is to raise awareness and to draw attention to the fact that the US and Canada have virtually no \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d laws, something that would protect a users right to have their data purged if they want to leave a site.\n\n\u201cMaybe my script won\u2019t make a huge impact on a global scale, but maybe it will get us talking about protecting our privacy,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cIf I want my data to be purged, I should have the right to do that.\u201d\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .", "description": "If you're savvy with code, you can employ a script that repeatedly alters your Facebook posts with nonsense, making it more difficult for the social media site to collect user data.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5abbd175257f380006563e8e/social_lede/1522340342119-shutterstock_176941343.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.78486008056636xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2018-03-28"}
