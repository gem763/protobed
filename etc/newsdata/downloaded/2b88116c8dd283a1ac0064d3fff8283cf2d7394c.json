I\u2019m able to tell you the following; the first time, you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.\n\n(S/NF) The President : [laughter] That\u2019s a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.\n\n(S/NF) President Zelenskyy : Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.\n\n(S/NF) The President : Well it\u2019s very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.1 Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it\u2019s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn\u2019t do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it\u2019s something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.2", "description": "Trump is accused of pressing Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/us/trump-phone-transcript-ukraine-promo-1569369870401/trump-phone-transcript-ukraine-promo-1569369870401-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
