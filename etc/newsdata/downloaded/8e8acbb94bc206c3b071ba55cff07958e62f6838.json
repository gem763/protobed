The real treat however, is the 7km stretch of private beach.\n\nIt\u2019s so vast, it never fills up with people, especially if you come during the off-season. I walked along El Haouzia every morning during my stay, and it\u2019s possibly one of the most serene experiences I\u2019ve had on any trip.\n\n(Picture: Almara Abgarian)\n\nBarring a few people riding horses early in the morning (also an option if you\u2019re staying at the resort), there\u2019s nothing but you, the sand and the ocean. Go for a morning dip, but beware of the current.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind a trek, walk towards the end of the strip where you can find the remnants of a ship that went aground in the late 80s.\n\nSay hello to the resort\u2019s camels (Picture: Almara Abgarian)\n\nIf you\u2019d rather lazy about on a sun lounger or grab a cocktail, there\u2019s a restaurant and a beach club at your disposal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI decided to skip the drinks and instead go quad biking through the sand dunes, before stopping by and saying hi to the resort\u2019s camels (top tip: they will give you a smooch, so watch out for the drool).\n\nWhere to eat Unfortunately, because we visited during Ramadan, there were next to no places open in El Jadida town during our visit, but La Capitainerie, located inside the fortress, has a beautiful sun-drenched terrace and is well-known for its cuisine. As for what to eat, the answer is easy: seafood (after all, you\u2019re on the coast) \u2013 drop into Mazagan\u2019s Sel de Mer or beach club for a treat from the ocean. El Jadida is all about seafood (Picture: Almara Abgarian La Cave, the french bistro, was my personal favourite. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 must be had, but the real treat is the wine cellar, filled to the brim with Moroccan wines \u2013 ask your waiter to choose one. I also enjoyed a traditional Iftar \u2013 the evening meal that Muslims have at sunset during Ramadan \u2013 which included, well, pretty much everything: BBQ meats, rice, mezze, dips and two tables filled with desserts. The foodie delights were accompanied by music from a local band.\n\nThe resort is nothing short of magnificent, but if you\u2019re anything like me \u2013 where luxury can soon turn into boredom \u2013 organise a day trip to nearby Casablanca.\n\nI lucked out with my driver; we took a detour on the way so he could show me his neighbourhood, an area known as Azemmour. His street consisted of nothing more than a few beige buildings surrounded by dry ground that looked as if it was begging for a spot of rain, but go a bit further and you\u2019ll find a 16th century fortress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn stark contrast to the opulence of Mazagan, this was an insight into the real Morocco, and it\u2019s also where many of the resort\u2019s staff live.\n\nCasablanca, I\u2019m afraid to say, was a bitter disappointment (and not just because I found out the movie was filmed in a studio).\n\nCasablanca\u2019s Hassan II is the largest mosque in Africa (Picture: Almara Abgarian)\n\nThe city is split in two; with the Old Medina and the New Medina. There\u2019s plenty to see, including the Royal Palace, the impressive Hassan II mosque \u2013 the largest mosque in Africa and the third largest mosque in the world, and it\u2019s also home to one of Africa\u2019s biggest shopping malls.\n\nThe reason for my less-than-enjoyable experience was likely due to the fact that I arrived in the day \u2013 there was nearly no one around and nothing was open (once again, Ramadan).\n\nWhile we were stuck in traffic, I was also warned by my driver that it was not safe for me to walk to the Old Medina on my own and as someone who enjoys solo travels, this felt disconcerting.\n\nI didn\u2019t heed the warning, and though nothing happened, I felt very uncomfortable (despite the fact I was completely covered, barring the lower part of my arms, my ankles and my neck).\n\nGet yourself a cheap leather bag from the souk, along with spices, olives and tourist trinkets (Picture: Almara Abgarian)\n\nAs a whole, Casablanca still has a lot to offer and is worth a visit, especially for the Habous Quarter, traditional hammam baths and various souks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, however, I felt relieved when we returned to the calmness and serenity of El Jadida and Mazagan.\n\nWhere to stay and how to get there Where to stay Most people who visit El Jadida stay at Mazagan. The resort, which is owned by Kerzner International, is well-known in the area, partly because of its impressive golf course, designed by South African golfer, Gary Player. You don\u2019t need to be a guest at the hotel to visit; many people come to gamble at the casino (where you can smoke inside), have dinner or visit the spa. It\u2019s so popular you have to book it in advance. The five-star resort has everything you could possibly want (Picture: Almara Abgarian) It\u2019s pricey, but worth it; I tried the traditional hammam massage, which involved sitting in a super hot sauna for a few minutes, before being scrubbed down head-to-toe (everything except the vagina) and lying on a slab before being rubbed and scrubbed some more. It\u2019s actually very soothing, and your skin will look amazing afterwards. I stayed in an ocean view room. Prices fluctuate depending on when you visit, but as an example, a week in June could cost you around over \u00a31,400 per person for this type of room, while the Royal Suite will be up towards \u00a310,000 or more for the same period. How to get there We flew with Air Maroc. If you like to have a pre-holiday tipple on the plane, you can\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s a dry flight. Thankfully, there are other options if booze is a must such as British Airways, Iberica and Air Italiano.\n\nMORE: How to spend a weekend break in Lake Como\n\nMORE: How to visit Brazil\u2019s Amazon rainforest in an eco-friendly way\n\nMORE: How to see Mauritius without breaking the bank\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The coastal town gives an authentic view of Morocco and is just a short drive from Mazagan, a luxury resort built by owners of the Atlantis.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian", "Freelance Journalist", "Editor", "Media Consultant"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_5491-05cf_1571500641.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
