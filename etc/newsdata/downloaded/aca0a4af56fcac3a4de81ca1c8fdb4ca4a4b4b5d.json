Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has appointed Judge Joop Labuschagne as president for the tribunal.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Western Cape High Court Judge President John Hlophe will face a Judicial Conduct Tribunal for allegedly attempting to influence Constitutional Court judges in a case involving former president Jacob Zuma.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7111/ec47439eb88e498382e0af73a9707718.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-02"}
