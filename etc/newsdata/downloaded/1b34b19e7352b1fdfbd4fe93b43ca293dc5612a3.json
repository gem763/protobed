(Emma McIntyre/Getty Images)\n\nA female screenwriter for the popular film \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d has left the Warner Bros. sequel over what she alleges was a pay disparity with a white male counterpart.\n\nAdele Lim, a veteran television writer who helped to bring Singaporean author Kevin Kwan\u2019s book to the screen last year, said in a Hollywood Reporter story Tuesday that she was offered significantly less than co-screenwriter Peter Chiarelli to work on the sequel to \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d a blockbuster hit that was lauded for bringing Asian American narratives to a mainstream audience and boosting the profile of underrepresented Asian American actors in Hollywood.\n\nLim\u2019s publicist confirmed to The Washington Post on Tuesday that the pay disparity was why she left the project.\n\nThe screenwriter declined to provide exact numbers, but according to sources who spoke to the Hollywood Reporter, her starting offer was $110,000 \u2014 nearly one tenth of the $800,000 to $1 million offered to Chiarelli. Lim said she believes women and people of color tend to be brought onto projects as \u201csoy sauce,\u201d tasked and credited with adding cultural texture but not with the heavy work of storytelling.\n\n\u201cBeing evaluated that way can\u2019t help but make you feel that is how they view my contributions,\u201d Lim told the Reporter.\n\nLim, who has worked on shows such as \u201cOne Tree Hill\u201d and \u201cPrivate Practice,\u201d said in a 2018 interview with the Los Angeles Times that director Jon M. Chu tapped her to join Chiarelli in adapting Kwan\u2019s books for screen because the film has a female protagonist \u2014 played by Constance Wu \u2014 and he wanted a female perspective in the writer\u2019s room.\n\nLim\u2019s departure puts a wrench in Chu\u2019s plans to keep the cast and production team intact for the upcoming sequels based on Kwan\u2019s other books, \u201cChina Rich Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cRich People Problems.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, female actors and actors of color have made similar departures from projects in an effort to bridge the well-documented wage gap. In 2017, Asian American actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park left the television show \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d due to alleged pay disparities with their white colleagues. Later that year, former \u201cE! News\u201d anchor Catt Sadler delivered a teary on-screen goodbye to audiences, writing later, \u201chow can I operate with integrity and stay on at E if they\u2019re not willing to pay me the same as [co-host Jason Kennedy]?\u201d\n\nThe Crazy Rich Asians sequel has stalled after co-writer Adele Lim exits because of a massive pay parity issue. (Warner Bros.' starting offers were $800,000 to $1 million for Chiarelli and $110,000-plus for Lim.) https://t.co/Rjn9ltrtle \u2014 Rebecca Ford (@Beccamford) September 4, 2019\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, Chiarelli, whose other writing credits include \u201cNow You See Me 2\u201d and \u201cThe Proposal,\u201d offered to split his fee with Lim, but she declined the gesture.\n\n\u201cPete has been nothing but incredibly gracious, but what I make shouldn\u2019t be dependent on the generosity of the white-guy writer,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t get pay equity after CRA, I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like for anyone else.\u201d\n\nLim, a Chinese Malaysian, was celebrated for bringing authenticity to \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d as one of the only screenwriters from Southeast Asia, where Kwan\u2019s books are set.\n\n\u201cWhen I came on, we basically talked about how I grew up in this culture,\u201d she said. \u201cImportant doesn\u2019t begin to describe it when you\u2019re talking about describing a culture and a family that the world \u2014 that America \u2014 hasn\u2019t seen before. You want it to come from an authentic perspective.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview with Awards Daily, she said she and Chu went out of their way to get \u201clittle cultural details\u201d just right.\n\n\u201cEven if it goes over the head of the mainstream audience, the Southeast Asians of the world can see it was very much done for them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a love letter to all those people.\u201d\n\nChiarelli and Chu did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n\nWarner Bros. declined to comment.", "description": "Adele Lim, a Chinese Malaysian, was celebrated for bringing authenticity to the film", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm", "Rebecca Tan Is A Reporter Working On The Local Desk In D.C.
