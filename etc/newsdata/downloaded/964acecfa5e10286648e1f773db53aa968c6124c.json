His other no-no was in 2007 for the Tigers against Milwaukee.\n\nThe 36-year-old Verlander joined Nolan Ryan (seven), Sandy Koufax (four) and Bob Feller, Cy Young and Larry Corcoran (three) in rarefied air on the no-hitter list.\n\nThis was the fourth no-hitter in the majors this year. The last one was a combined effort by Houston\u2019s Aaron Sanchez, Will Harris, Joe Biagini and Chris Devenski (9) against Seattle on Aug. 3.\n\nOakland\u2019s Mike Fiers and a tandem effort by Taylor Cole and Felix Pena of the Angels accounted for this year\u2019s other gems.\n\nVerlander (17-5) is tied for the big league lead in wins. He tops the majors in strikeouts and innings and leads the AL in ERA.\n\nRookie Abraham Toro hit a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth inning off Ken Giles (2-3) that cleared the way for Verlander to complete the no-hitter.\n\nToro made a routine play on Bo Bichette\u2019s grounder for the final out.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Houston Astros ace Justin Verlander pitches 3rd career no-hitter in 2-0 victory over Toronto Blue Jays.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/Astros_Blue_Jays_Baseball_96414.jpg-c26bf_c0-325-3000-2074_s1770x1032.jpg?9f070271dabc4376bc01cbccb4bf148e2bcd239f"}
