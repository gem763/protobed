Now he\u2019s got his highest-profile feature yet on the way with Dr. Sleep. Based on Stephen King\u2019s recent sequel to the classic The Shining, Dr. Sleep follows the grown-up Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) as he tries to live with the blessing and curse of Shining. (Spoiler: Things aren\u2019t exactly going great for him.) Danny meets a young girl (Kyliegh Curran) with the Shining, and resolves to protect her from a cult known as the True Knot (possibly led by Rebecca Ferguson) which preys on kids with powers like hers. The trailer shows us that Danny is still talking to ghosts wherever he goes, though he also heads back to where it all started: the Overlook Hotel. Dr. Sleep arrives in theaters on November 8, and there seem to be plenty of ghosts that are not even hidden.\n\nRelated", "description": "Watch the trailer for the new adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s Dr. Sleep, starring Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson, and from the director of Haunting of Hill House, Mike Flanagan.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/24/8-sleep.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
