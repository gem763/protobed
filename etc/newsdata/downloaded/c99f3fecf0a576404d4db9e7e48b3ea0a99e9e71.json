Then 27, and a waiter in a Turkish restaurant in York, Ozcan dreamed he was holding \u201cloads of cash\u201d while standing in front of his boss. When he arrived at the restaurant for his 5pm shift the next day, he was impatient to speak with his employer. \u201cI was saying: \u2018Where is he? I need him.\u2019 I was telling everyone I had to play the lottery with the boss,\u201d Ozcan says. After two hours of pestering, Ozcan\u2019s boss agreed to play. Two days later, the winning EuroMillions numbers were drawn \u2013 the pair won \u00a31m.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had loads of dreams that have become true, but they were little things, like travelling somewhere or having a nice day,\u201d he says. Ozcan was certain this dream was prophetic and that he and his boss would win money together, because a month earlier he prayed for wealth for the first time. \u201cMy boss and my colleagues didn\u2019t believe it, but I believed it and that\u2019s why I pressured him for hours.\u201d\n\nEvery month premonitions hit the headlines \u2013 from the (ironically predictable) claims of Uri Geller to the countless celebrities who claim they foresaw 9/11 (including Michael Caine, Christine Lampard and Richard Madeley). Like Ozcan, several lottery winners claim they predicted their wins. In May this year, a man in Australia and a woman in Maryland both won the lottery by choosing numbers that they say came to them in a dream.\n\nThat same month, a woman who lost her fianc\u00e9 in the 2017 London Bridge terror attacks told an inquest about the moments before his death. Walking towards the Shard on the warm June evening, Christine Delcros suddenly felt uneasy as they neared the bridge and begged her partner to turn back. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t go there, we should go somewhere else,\u201d she recalled saying. Tragically, her fianc\u00e9 was the first of eight people killed in the attack.\n\nThe Wikipedia page for \u201cprecognition\u201d is unforgiving; off the bat, the world\u2019s most popular information resource claims premonitions are \u201cwidely considered to be pseudoscience\u201d. This doesn\u2019t change the fact that many of us have a similar story \u2013 a sense of unease before an accident, a familiar unfamiliar place, a disconcerting jolt of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit like seeing a memory of a place you have never been before\n\nIn 1967, Dr John Barker set up the London Premonitions Bureau to formally allow people to record their visions. It was the subject of a New Yorker article earlier this year. He collected many remarkable stories: shipwrecks, floods and tornadoes predicted in advance. A year after launching the bureau, two people even predicted the doctor\u2019s own death \u2013 he died of a brain haemorrhage in August 1968. Yet 60 years later, the most accepted explanation of precognition is that we suffer from cognitive biases, retroactively seeking patterns to make sense of a senseless world. Still, like Barker, many continue to formalise the power of premonitions \u2013 and even hope to profit from the process.\n\nDr Julia Mossbridge, a visiting psychology scholar at Northwestern University in the US, and co-author of The Premonition Code: How Sensing the Future Can Change Your Life, says there is an ever-expanding \u201cprecog economy\u201d, where people with alleged precognitive powers sell their abilities to business people, law-enforcement officials and even health professionals.\n\n\u201cPeople who are good at this can make money from it, and people who want the services can buy them for all sectors of the economy,\u201d says Mossbridge, who had her first precognitive dream (about a school friend losing her watch) when she was seven. She says her so-called \u201cpositive precogs\u201d (named after the mutated humans who predicted the future in the 2002 thriller Minority Report) differ from psychics with crystal balls and \u00a31.50/min phone lines. \u201cWhat I\u2019m imagining is a much more sophisticated and structurally supported version of that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe UN could have a group of precogs who\u2019d work on climate change alongside experts in the area. They\u2019re just one mode of knowing.\u201d\n\nMossbridge\u2019s dreams for a precog economy are undoubtedly ambitious, particularly as the scientific community considers precognition to be pseudoscience. \u201cIf I had to bet money on it, I would bet against the existence of these abilities based on my judgment of the currently available evidence,\u201d says Professor Christopher French, head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths University. Yet French isn\u2019t the one betting money. It is ordinary people who are paying precog businesses for stock market predictions and gambling tips. Mossbridge notes that psychic services have been growing since the recession and estimates the US psychic industry is worth $2bn. \u201cOnce precognition hits the higher-end markets \u2013 governments, investment banking \u2013 the estimates will go up by an order of magnitude,\u201d she says.\n\nDaz Smith is a 49-year-old from Bath who works for an American business, CryptoViewing, to predict cryptocurrency trends. He says more than 20,000 subscribers pay a monthly fee (on a tiered structure starting from $1) to access insights from five precogs. Anyone can apply to work for CryptoViewing \u2013 to be eligible, you simply have to prove yourself by providing information about a faraway, unknown target the company sets.\n\n\u201cThe typical way I do it is I sit down at a table with a stack of paper and a pen, put my headphones on and meditate,\u201d explains Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s generally classical music, because it has no words and I don\u2019t want to be influenced.\u201d At the moment, Smith is listening to the soundtrack from the 2014 sci-fi film Interstellar. It takes him an hour to gather information. He says he sees \u201cvague visuals\u201d and feels snippets of emotions that he scribbles down on the page.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Ordinary people are paying precog businesses for stock market predictions and gambling tips.\u2019 Illustration: Nathalie Lees/The Observer\n\n\u201cIf you ask CEOs of top companies how they became successful, the majority of them will say they got there because they followed their gut feeling,\u201d says Smith. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing \u2013 as a psychic, an intuitive.\u201d Smith says his predictions are \u201c80% accurate, 75% of the time\u201d.\n\nMichael D Austin is the founder of Soul Rider, a California business that offers financial forecasting to clients. He assesses \u201csignals\u201d from his team of precog \u201cviewers\u201d in conjunction with traditional market analysis. \u201cIf eight people say the markets are going to go up and two people say the market is going to go down, you make a decision based on both experience and intuition.\u201d His clients include inventors, stakeholders and entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been extremely helpful for me,\u201d says Andrea Driver, a 50-year-old from Sacramento who has been using Soul Rider\u2019s services for a year. Earlier this year, Austin advised her against purchasing a piece of land for her business \u2013 it later emerged there were permit issues with the location. \u201cHaving him tapping into that, precogging that, was very helpful.\u201d It is easy to be sceptical of psychic claims. At one point during our call, Austin says he has \u201ca feeling there\u2019s a reason you opted to write this story\u201d.\n\nEr, yes, I say sheepishly, I was commissioned by an editor.\n\nBoth Austin and Smith also say they don\u2019t want to use their powers to become millionaires themselves. Yet Caroline Watt, a parapsychologist at the University of Edinburgh, says studies have found a \u201csmall\u201d but \u201cstatistically significant\u201d precognitive effect in humans. \u201cI know that sceptical scientists would argue it is not possible to look into the future, therefore it is obviously nonsense when a study claims a positive effect,\u201d she says. However, Watt says there are some well-controlled studies that are hard to explain. She cites a 1989 meta-analysis of 309 \u201cfuture-telling\u201d studies conducted on 50,000 subjects between 1935 and 1987. The analysis concluded that \u201cevidence for an overall effect is strong.\u201d In 2016, researchers from the University of New South Wales found that \u201cnon-conscious emotional information\u201d enables us to make better decisions \u2013 in short, intuition exists. If it\u2019s accepted we subconsciously gather hidden information from our surroundings, is precognition a possibility?\n\nDespite this evidence, Watt warns that people shouldn\u2019t put much stock (or shares) in the precog economy. \u201cI would say it is a form of gambling because, although there may be a tiny effect, it\u2019s not something of much practical use. The odds might be 1 in 1,000. I wouldn\u2019t bet my house or my health on that.\u201d\n\nMossbridge is an optimist. While she agrees with Watt\u2019s \u201csmall but statistically significant\u201d framing, she believes further research is needed. \u201cScientists never used to be able to study meditation, because it was seen as too \u2018woo woo\u2019, but then people meditated and reduced stress, so now studies get funded,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it always works \u2013 science is the last to jump on the bandwagon.\u201d\n\nIf science is last, then the military is first. Many precogs don\u2019t just look into the future, Smith and Austin both use a technique known as \u201cremote viewing\u201d to explore distant targets in the present and the past. In 1995, the CIA declassified documents related to a secret army project, Stargate, that spent $20m researching remote viewing for 20 years, from the 1970s onwards. The files concluded that \u201cremote viewers can be used as collectors in conjunction with other intelligence sources\u201d. A major success came in 1976, when a remote viewer named Rosemary Smith found the location of a lost Soviet spy plane (in 1995, former president Jimmy Carter confirmed the incident had taken place). Yet Ray Hyman, a psychology professor tasked by the CIA to evaluate Stargate, wrote of consistent methodological problems, concluding there was little evidence remote viewing worked, let alone that it was useful in intelligence operations.\n\nGail Husick, 55, is a former partner in a law firm who founded a remote-viewing agency in Washington in 2014. Among other things, the Husick Group has helped the police with missing-person cases, found a lost passport, searched for stolen art and advised an entrepreneur on technology patents. Fees begin at $3,000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the information business,\u201d she says, claiming she is not a \u201ctypical\u201d psychic. \u201cI had a pretty traditional education and family background. I went to Harvard Law School, I practised in Silicon Valley.\u201d After experiencing precognitive dreams, Husick trained as a remote viewer \u2013 as part of Stargate, the government funded a project at Stanford Research Institute to create a remote viewing training protocol. Husick compares remote viewing to an aperture opening and closing rapidly, like the flash of images you might get when recalling your childhood bedroom. She gives her viewers a vague instruction, for example, \u201cYour target is a location,\u201d and they get into a meditative state before sketching and jotting down what they see. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like seeing a memory, except it\u2019s just a place you haven\u2019t been before.\u201d As such, Husick warns that remote viewing is \u201calmost never 100% accurate\u201d and is best used alongside other information.\n\nTim O\u2019Brien, 61, is a Microsoft employee from Seattle who was adopted as a child and employed Husick to help find his birth mother. Over several months, Husick produced a 25-page report that O\u2019Brien says gave \u201cvery, very intimate\u201d details about his mother that she later confirmed to be true. O\u2019Brien says these details include the fact that his mother worked in a mercantile environment and is very short, and that O\u2019Brien\u2019s conception was non- consensual and distressing. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that it wasn\u2019t just lucky guessing.\u201d O\u2019Brien found his mother a year after Husick\u2019s report \u2013 but not because of it. \u201cThey tried to pinpoint the town and were inaccurate,\u201d he says, adding this \u201ccaused an unnecessary side-track\u201d in his journey. Yet he has no regrets, and recommends remote viewing to others. \u201cI think it\u2019s a valuable tool.\u201d\n\nHusick offers to conduct a remote-viewing session for me. I choose a location \u2013 a small hut-like pagoda on the northwestern corner of Nami Island, a micronation in South Korea where my boyfriend proposed to me earlier this summer.\n\nHusick used 13 remote viewers for the task and then sent me her report. I was initially unimpressed by the results. The viewers saw \u201ca curved structure\u201d that resembled a pit or an amphitheatre, there was reference to tiered seating, and Husick\u2019s report mentioned a tunnel, mine, or shaft. \u201cThere is a sense of intense desire, danger, threat, aggression and competition associated with the target location,\u201d the report reads, somewhat insultingly.\n\nThose who buy into the precog economy don\u2019t like to publicise the fact \u2013 police forces prefer to keep quiet about it\n\nWhen I tell Husick the viewing failed, she is unperturbed. \u201cI understand your initial reaction. Most people expect us to be like psychics in the movies and the reality is that our work is much more painstaking,\u201d she says. She explores Nami Island on Google and finds several consistencies with the viewers\u2019 visions. She points out that several viewers spoke of a tower-like feature near the target location \u2013 a zipwire runs from the mainland to the island. The report shows that Viewer 12 saw \u201cmultiples of human males rappelling downwards suspended by rope-like cords\u201d. Husick adds that, although I didn\u2019t see it, there is cascaded seating on the island \u2013 in a garden area \u2013 and it\u2019s adorned with flags, just as one viewer drew. She explains that if I were a real client, multiple sessions would have been undertaken, and this report is just a \u201cfirst pass\u201d at the target.\n\nHusick considers our session a success; I remain confused. The viewers\u2019 results are over 200 pages long. For every result that makes me gasp (Viewer 12 drew a structure that looks remarkably like my pagoda), another dampens my mood (one viewer saw an \u201cindustrial wasteland\u201d and \u201curban decay\u201d \u2013 the island is lush and green, and peacocks wander freely).\n\nShould I put stock in Husick\u2019s consistencies? Professor French says a cognitive bias known as \u201csubjective validation\u201d means people consider information correct if it has personal value to them (he notes that no one is immune and, thanks to his career, he himself has a vested interest in being a sceptic). \u201cHow do we know that those correspondences didn\u2019t just occur by chance? In 200 pages, there\u2019s bound to be elements that match any location you go to,\u201d he says.\n\nYet Mossbridge argues it\u2019s still a growing business. \u201cThere are more and more people who are building applications of this work. Some are legitimate and some are not, but they\u2019re getting customers who are buying their work for reasonable and sometimes exorbitant prices, which means that the sceptics are not winning.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that those who do buy into the precog economy don\u2019t like to publicise the fact. Austin, Husick and Smith all say that police forces who work with them prefer to keep quiet about it, and Austin believes the precog economy will have to stay on the \u201cdownlow\u201d as it expands. \u201cIt scares people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt scares the hell out of them.\u201d\n\nWinning the lottery after a precognitive dream was the least remarkable part of Fatih Ozcan\u2019s story. The waiter only found out he\u2019d won nine days after the draw, because his boss kept the ticket and refused to halve the winnings. After protracted police proceedings, Ozcan took him to court. It was a distressing time \u2013 telling the story makes his voice shake. \u201cPeople were telling me I had no chance of winning the court case,\u201d he says. Yet midway through his ordeal, he received reassurance in the middle of the night. \u201cI had another dream showing me I would win the case,\u201d he recalls. After a week-long trial in 2014, a judge ruled that Ozcan should be given his \u00a3500,000 share.", "description": "Precognition is the claimed paranormal ability to predict the future \u2013 and is widely considered to be pseudoscience.
