British Airways, a unit of International Consolidated Airlines Group, separately was forced to cancel nearly all of its flights (link)due to an airline strike.\n\nBroader markets showed little movement. The Stoxx Europe 600 index gained 0.07% to 387.40.\n\nThe German DAX increased 0.32% to 12230.31, the French CAC 40 gained 0.03% to 5605.57 and the U.K. FTSE 100 weakened 0.29% to 7261.56.\n\nU.S. stock futures were a bit stronger.\n\nThere was a slight bit of positive news on the U.S.-China trade war front as Politico reported that China offered to make modest U.S. agricultural purchases -- if the U.S. relaxed restrictions on Huawei and also delayed the next tariff increase.\n\nU.K. economic data came in better than forecast, with monthly GDP rising by 0.3% and industrial production edging upward in July.\n\nOf other notable movers, ProSiebenSat.1 Media (PSM.XE) rallied 5% as UBS upgraded the company to buy from neutral, saying it's too cheap to ignore despite the macro headwinds.\n\nAssociated British Foods (ABF.LN) fell over 2% after reiterating that adjusted EPS will be flat for the year.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 09, 2019 06:43 ET (10:43 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
