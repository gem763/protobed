We\u2019ll learn about the history of the shop and see how doughnuts are made the old-fashioned way.\n\nVisit Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nHerrine Ro: What\u2019s better than a fresh, hot doughnut? Absolutely nothing, that\u2019s what. That\u2019s why, on my trip to Vancouver, I had to stop in the city\u2019s most legendary doughnut shop. I get the doughnut, like, fresh out of the fryer.\n\nCarol Kaesbauer: Just, doughnuts just make everybody happy.\n\nCustomer: It\u2019s really good.\n\nCarol: So, our 40th year of operations. It was started by Mr. and Mrs. Lee. We\u2019ve been in, one of the three or four original vendors left in the Granville Island Public Market and just been sticking to the same thing that we always did was homemade, handmade, you know, doughnuts from scratch and just keeping it fresh and original recipe from 40 years ago. It\u2019s just your good old-fashioned doughnuts.\n\nHerrine: The doughnuts are even a favourite for local celebrities, like Seth Rogen. They keep a box reserved for him every day. He\u2019s known to pop in unannounced. Maybe even with a friend. [whispering] That friend is David Chang. I\u2019ve never had doughnut holes fresh out of the fryer and glazed. Cheers. Alvin\n\nGeorge: Cheers.\n\nHerrine: Oh, man.\n\nCustomer: The doughnuts speak for themselves, but we just appreciate the community behind the market and the community behind this business here. It\u2019s a family-run business. And then the honey-dip doughnut speaks for itself. So amazing, the doughnut just melts in your mouth.\n\nHerrine: Head baker Alvin George has worked at Lee\u2019s for over 35 years, and he was even childhood friends with manager Carol.\n\nAlvin: I used to eat, like, four doughnuts a day.\n\nHerrine: [laughing] And then you kinda had to tone it down. Yeah, I feel like if I were working here, half of these would be gone by now. The famous honey-dip doughnuts are fried fresh, and Alvin quality-tests them daily. I wanted to see if I had what it takes, but I learned it\u2019s best to leave doughnut-making to the professionals. Oh, it doesn\u2019t get any better than that. I feel so fortunate right now to try this doughnut, like, so fresh, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s, like, steaming still. It\u2019s so fluffy, do you see those air pockets? Like, I feel like I\u2019m just biting into air. OK, I need to stop, \u2019cause I know that I\u2019m gonna probably have to eat a few more. Then it was time for the big mama doughnut. She\u2019s fried, she\u2019s glazed, and she\u2019s filled with jelly, much like me after this shoot. It is so crunchy! I know Seth Rogen likes his doughnuts filled with this jelly, but has he ever tried this behemoth of a thing? Because I think this will be his next favourite. Best doughnuts in Canada.\n\nCarol: I\u2019ve had kids come in here from when they were really little, and now they\u2019re parents themselves, and they bring their kids in, and it\u2019s really neat to see. You know, we get all ages in here enjoying the doughnuts.\n\nHerrine: Don\u2019t look at me. I know I said I was gonna stop. Don\u2019t look at me.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
