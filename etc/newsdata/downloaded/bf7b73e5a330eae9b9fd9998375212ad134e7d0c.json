One was a banana chocolate Pikachu face doughnut, and the other was a delicious strawberry chocolate recreation of a Pokeball.\n\nNow, the Pokemon themed doughnuts are coming back again in time for winter, with revamped designs that will make any Pikachu fan want to catch \u2018em all.\n\nAlthough not that much information has been released yet and it seems the banana chocolate coated Pikachu face doughnut is back in its original form. However, the Pokeball has evolved into one of Mister Donut\u2019s classic Pon de Ring shapes.\n\nThere\u2019s also a brand new item, a French cruller which has been designed to look like Pikachu\u2019s back. Pikachu\u2019s instantly recognisable color scheme is used and his iconic lightning bolt tail is also sticking out, just to make sure there\u2019s no mistake about what this doughnut represents. There was a Twitter competition to decide on a name for the new doughnut last month, so it will be interesting to see what they go with in the end.\n\nThe Pokemon themed treats will go on sale from Nov 15 and we can expect more announcements about the doughnuts and any exclusive goods closer to the time.\n\nSource: PR Times\n\nRead more stories from grape Japan.\n\n-- Charming Studio Ghibli-Themed SteamCream Moisturizer Tins Are Back With New Designs\n\n-- McDonalds Japan Release Oreo and Uji Matcha Frappe For Autumn Season\n\n-- Illustrator Creates Adorable Mini-Shiba Inu Yen Alternative And It Gets Turned Into Awesome Merchandise\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://grapee.jp/en/\n\n\u00a9 grape Japan", "description": "Last November, Japan\u2019s popular doughnut chain, Mister Donut, released two super cute treats for Pokemon lovers.
