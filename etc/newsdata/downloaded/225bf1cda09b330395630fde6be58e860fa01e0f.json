The Post is owned by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos but is otherwise unaffiliated with Amazon itself.\n\nAD\n\nTrump turned his animus toward the Times and Post up a notch in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t even want [the Times] in the White House anymore. \u201cWe\u2019re going to probably terminate that and The Washington Post. They\u2019re fake.\u201d\n\nThe White House has already canceled its subscriptions to the papers, according to several accounts.\n\nAD\n\nThe two papers have been among the leading news sources in investigating Trump, and have closely covered the impeachment inquiry in the House that threatens his presidency.\n\nThe Times won a Pulitzer Prize earlier this year for a series of stories detailing Trump\u2019s inheritance from his father and his family\u2019s history of using questionable and possibly illegal strategies to avoid taxes.\n\nThe Times and The Post shared a Pulitzer in 2018 for documenting Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to Trump\u2019s campaign and his transition team and administration. During the 2016 campaign, both papers aggressively covered allegations that he sexually assaulted women. And The Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold won a Pulitzer for coverage \u201ccasting doubt on Donald Trump\u2019s assertions of generosity toward charities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump responded earlier this year by saying in a tweet that the Pulitzer committee should withdraw the Russia prize awarded to the papers. In June, he tweeted that a Times story about the United States\u2019 cyber campaign against Russian targets was \u201ca virtual act of Treason by a once great paper so desperate for a story, any story, even if bad for our Country.\u201d He repeated his now-familiar mantra: \u201cEnemy of the people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many subscriptions federal agencies have to the newspapers, and whether these are to the physical paper itself, to its digital equivalent or to both.\n\nSpokespeople for the Times and Post had no comment.\n\nPresidents have canceled newspapers in fits of pique at their coverage before. President Kennedy canceled the White House\u2019s subscription to the New York Herald Tribune in the early 1960s. According to historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in his account of Kennedy\u2019s presidency, \u201cA Thousand Days,\u201d Kennedy was angry at the newspaper\u2019s editorials about impropriety in his administration, complaining that the newspaper underplayed similar behavior in the Eisenhower administration.\n\nThe White House eventually renewed its subscription.\n\nAD", "description": "White House says the move will save \u201chundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.\u201d", "authors": ["Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/87HUWPKm_qUHnwyj8rqFuqdvGUo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C2JDCZXVYAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
