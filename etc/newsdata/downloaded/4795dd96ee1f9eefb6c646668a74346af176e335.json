This made many of the women feel unsafe, and one of the groups described a situation to me in which \u2018big hairy men\u2019 would come in and have to be accepted into the women\u2019s shelter even though it made the women in the facility very uncomfortable. My point was that we have to permit policies that take into consideration the rights of everybody, including those women \u2014 many of which have suffered at the hands of male domestic abusers \u2014 who believe there are men who might hurt them.\u201d\n\nCarson said that while he believes \u201call people are valuable,\u201d it is the government\u2019s responsibility to \u201cmake sure that all people are treated fairly and equally.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say:\n\n\u201cOur society is in danger when we pick one issue (such as gender identity) and say it does not matter how it impacts others because this one issue should override every other common-sense consideration. I think we have to look out for everyone, and we need to use our intellectual capabilities to find common good rather than attempting to always stir up controversy through identity politics.\u201d\n\nCarson wrote that he normally does not \u201crespond to media stories\u201d but that \u201cwhen blatant mischaracterizations of what I have said are circulated in an irresponsible way, I feel it is important to set the record straight.\u201d\n\nA HUD official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters said Carson decided to write the email once he learned from the Post report that \u201cfolks were upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to address the issue head-on with staff the best way he could,\u201d the official said.\n\nBut Carson\u2019s attempt to explain himself did not appear to appease staffers who were angered by his remarks.\n\n\u201cSuggesting the department should adopt a policy that prioritizes someone\u2019s discomfort over another person\u2019s right to shelter validates bigoted ideas about transgender women and the frankly ludicrous idea that \u2018big, hairy men\u2019 pretend to be women in order to harm cisgender women,\u201d said one HUD staffer who heard his comments in San Francisco.\n\nAnother HUD staffer who did not previously speak with The Post said Carson\u2019s email \u201cjust made it worse\u201d and \u201cput salt in the wound, because this description of transgender people is offensive.\u201d\n\nAgency staffers spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.\n\nSeveral Democrats had called for Carson\u2019s removal immediately following the Post report, which, in addition to his comments in San Francisco, also documented a history of dismissive remarks about transgender people. While running for president, Carson referred to transgender people as \u201cabnormal\u201d and said they should not be in the military.\n\nAs HUD secretary, he has also repeatedly mocked transgender people in internal meetings in Washington, according to a government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations in which the person was involved.\n\nRep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) called Carson\u2019s comments \u201csickening\u201d on Twitter. \u201cBen Carson shouldn\u2019t even be given the chance to resign,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cHe should be fired tonight.\u201d\n\nRep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) said that Carson\u2019s \u201cbigotry is putting lives in danger. He needs to resign.\u201d\n\nAs HUD secretary, Carson has weakened Obama-era protections for transgender people, saying he believes in equal rights, not \u201cspecial rights.\u201d\n\nIn early 2017, shortly after Carson took charge of the agency, the HUD website removed links to documents that guided emergency shelters on how best to comply with agency regulations and serve transgender people facing homelessness. It also withdrew proposals that would have required HUD-funded emergency shelters to post notices informing people of LGTBQ rights and protections.\n\nIn May, the agency introduced a proposal that would allow federally funded shelters to deny people admission on religious grounds or force transgender women to share bathrooms and sleeping quarters with men.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Transgender Equality, 1 in 3 transgender people have experienced homelessness \u2014 including 1 in 8 in the past year \u2014 putting them at risk of physical and sexual violence and being forced into sex work.\n\nA second HUD employee in San Francisco who was offended by Carson\u2019s original comments said his email came across as \u201cdefensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome remorse for the impact of his words would have been appreciated,\u201d the person said. \u201cWhile he says he\u2019s consulted women in shelters, I would have liked him to take this opportunity to recognize that he has much to learn about housing issues facing the trans community, as we all do.\u201d\n\nHUD spokeswoman Caroline Vanvick on Friday released a statement saying that Carson would \u201ccontinue to make sure everyone is guaranteed equal rights \u2014 not given extra rights. He does not believe any one group deserves to be treated better or worse than any other group. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs when staff tasked with serving the public would attempt to twist his words in order to politically grandstand.\u201d", "description": "Carson on Friday sent an agency-wide email seeking to explain his comments and blaming the media for \"blatant mischaracterizations of what I have said.\"", "authors": ["Tracy Jan", "Reporter Covering The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SPXHZTG32YI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
