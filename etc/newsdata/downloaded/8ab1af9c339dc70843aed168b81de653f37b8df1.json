I think that's what will get you towards winning the competition come the end of the season. In this case, though, I was not impressed with what happened in Potch.\n\n\"For that reason, we've put it behind us as quickly as possible and start from scratch when we go to East London.\"\n\nIn the Lions' opener, they were bowled out for 215 in their first innings thanks in the main to Kagiso Rapulana, one of few positive performances in the game with his unbeaten half-century.\n\n\"There weren\u2019t many positives in the game, that's why this is a fresh start against the Warriors,\" Gwavu explained. \"We'll take it like that and not carry much from the last game.\n\n\"We're looking forward to the next game against a team who always challenge us. We're still fully focussed on what we need to do and try and improve in this game.\"\n\nThe Lions have also been bolstered by the news that their new Proteas superstar, Rassie van der Dussen, is now back with the team.\n\n\"Rassie is back and in contention for the game,\" Gwavu added. \"He has practised with us this week and we look forward to welcoming him back.\"\n\nLast season the two teams were involved in an epic encounter that went right down to the wire on the final day of the season. The Lions ended up bowling out the Warriors late on the final day, in the near darkness of the North West light.\n\n- Cricket South Africa", "description": "Lions coach Wandile Gwavu is looking forward to facing the Warriors in East London ahead of their 4-Day Domestic Series clash next week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7377/b7fac7c66413409f88081a62b4e1e0d6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
