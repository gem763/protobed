But positive associations with the term such as prosperity, peace, opulence and innocence do not cover the charge of historical reality in this period. The term ignores the many negative sides of the 17th century such as poverty, war, forced labour and human trafficking.\u201d\n\nThe museum said the term would not be used in future exhibitions and that the name of the museum\u2019s permanent collection will be changed from Dutch in the Golden Age to Group Portraits of the 17th Century.\n\nThe treatment of the Dutch colonial period in public spaces has become a matter for keenly contested debate in recent years with street names changed and questions raised about the relevance of statues celebrating military heroes of the past.\n\nNazi design exhibition in Netherlands raises fears of glorification Read more\n\nWhen the Mauritshuis museum, which is home to a host of national treasures including Vermeer\u2019s Girl With a Pearl Earring, removed a bust of its namesake from the museum\u2019s foyer in 2018, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, cautioned against \u201cjudging the distant past through today\u2019s eyes\u201d.\n\nCount Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, a cousin of the Prince of Orange, was governor of the Dutch colony in Brazil in the 1630s.\n\nIn response to the Amsterdam Museum\u2019s decision, Zohair el Yassini, an MP for the governing centre-right VVD party, said the institution had \u201clost the plot completely\u201d.\n\nHe told De Telegraaf: \u201cFirst we had to change the street signs, then the statues had to go and now the whole Golden Age is for the scrapheap? It\u2019s a bit cowardly to want to rewrite history.\u201d\n\nMichel Rog, a spokesman for the Christian Democratic Appeal party, said: \u201cThis name change is a hyper-correct idea of \u200b\u200bthe Amsterdam elite and actually too ridiculous for words. \u201cErasing the past is nonsense. Just explain that the Golden Age also had negative sides. There is nothing wrong with that. Just like a little national pride. Nothing wrong with that either.\u201d\n\nAs part of its move to broaden its coverage of history, the Amsterdam Museum is holding a symposium this month about untold stories from the 17th century. It will open with an exhibition entitled Dutch Masters Reviewed, about 13 Amsterdam residents and visitors of colour from the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nJudikje Kiers, the museum\u2019s director, told the daily newspaper Het Parool: \u201cThese are important steps in a long process, but we are not there yet. We will continue to work with people in the city to uncover underexposed stories and perspectives of our shared history.\u201d\n\nThe Rijksmuseum, another of the Netherlands\u2019 most high-profile museums, said it would continue to use the term Golden Age. The institution\u2019s director, Taco Dibbits, told the broadcaster NOS: \u201cThe name refers to a period in history of great prosperity. That does not alter the fact that we acknowledge the dark side of this. The Rijksmuseum approaches history from different perspectives. For example, we are opening an exhibition on slavery next year.\u201d", "description": "Debate over Netherlands\u2019 colonial past resurfaces with switch to \u201817th century\u2019 as alternative", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7dac68f230759cc3de87c2561baca3c435ac0b9/0_177_5300_3180/master/5300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d814f376dd852921228ecb55635427e2", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
