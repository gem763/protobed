I mean, you can't really ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe Rupert Goold-directed film takes place in 1968 and \"celebrates the voice, the capacity for love and the sheer pizzazz of 'the world\u2019s greatest entertainer,'\" according to film studio Pathe UK.\n\n\"Judy\" largely focuses on the last year of the icon's life. Garland was tremendously successful throughout her career, starring in classics like 1939's \"The Wizard of Oz,\" 1944's \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" 1948's \"Easter Parade\" and 1954's \"A Star Is Born.\" She died in 1969 at age 47 from an accidental drug overdose.\n\nZellweger said it was important to play this role to show Garland's life \"from a different lens.\"\n\n\"As a person whose lived with the public persona for quite some time, you understand the vast gulf between the narrative of the persona and the human life,\" she told \"Good Morning America's\" Michael Strahan.\n\n\"For some reason, it seems like that chapter in her life was sort of blanketed with the idea of tragedy,\" Zellweger shared.\n\n\"I feel like when you contextualize the circumstances of her life in that time -- it actually subverts that notion and you can see her as the kind of warrior and hero that she really was,\" she added.\n\nIf you look at all the tragedy Judy Garland faced in her life, \u201cyou can see her as the warrior and hero she truly was.\u201d - Renee Zellweger on why she wanted to be in @JudyTheFilm pic.twitter.com/XTsNcHj04x \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) September 24, 2019\n\nIn order to get into character, the actress spent a few months working with the film's hair and makeup teams to perfect her physical similarities with Garland. Zellweger called her recreation of the late singer \"a process of discovery.\"\n\n\"Rupert, the director, wanted to keep it minimal, so that it wasn't just a big swath of plastic -- to block the story telling basically, but an hour and a half we got it down to,\" she said of the hair and makeup process.\n\nWOW!

It was sort of like an immersion into this legacy of gorgeous work that so many of us feel affection for and a connection to.\"\n\n\"It was a series of experiments that were shared with all of the different members of the crew ... we were all sort of mining for treasure -- to find little bits and pieces, little secrets, very important nuggets that seemed essential in conjuring her essence,\" she added.\n\nWhen asked what she thinks Garland would think of her portrayal, Zellweger conveyed how much respect and care was put into the film.\n\n\"I hope that, if she was here, that she would feel the affection and the admiration that motivated everybody to want to make this film and that palpable on that set every day,\" she shared. \"Everybody wanted to do their very best to express their affection and appreciation for her.\"", "description": "Renee Zellweger spoke about what it was like to play the late icon Judy Garland on", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/renee-zellweger-judy-movie-ht-ml-190510_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
