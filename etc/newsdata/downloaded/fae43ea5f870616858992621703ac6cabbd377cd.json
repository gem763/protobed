Photo: Doane Gregory/Twentieth Century Fox\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years since the release of Jennifer\u2019s Body, a movie that was panned by the majority of critics upon release and largely rejected at the box office. Movies flop all the time, but there was something distinct about the way Body failed. The story, written by Diablo Cody and directed by Karyn Kusama, concerned a pair of best friends named Jennifer (Megan Fox) and Needy (Amanda Seyfried) who were navigating teenage bestie codependency and the small problem of Jennifer being turned into a boy-eating succubus. It was more revenge story than vampire thrill, intent on subverting horror heroine tropes, skewering the typical commodification of women onscreen, and showcasing a kind of intimacy between teen girls rarely seen in movies.\n\nHowever, the movie\u2019s marketing campaign tells a different story. Twentieth Century Fox promoted the film around a ginned-up, vixenish version of Fox\u2019s media-friendly persona, seemingly downplaying Body\u2019s potential audience of young girls in favor of horny boys aged 18 to 24. Unfortunately, criticism unraveled accordingly. One reviewer offered the assessment that, \u201cIf you\u2019re in search for a way to ogle Megan Fox\u2019s body, there are a lot better ways to do it than subjecting yourself to this [movie]\u201d; another said that Fox \u201ctelegraphs Jennifer\u2019s role as the Generic Spoiled Slut\u201d before lamenting that Seyfried was styled from a \u201cluscious bit of blonde honeycomb\u201d into a \u201csexy librarian\u201d look instead. Even just ten years later, it seems clear that Fox and Jennifer\u2019s Body were caught in the gears of a particularly unforgiving stage of celebrity discourse.\n\nBut what a decade it\u2019s been for Jennifer\u2019s Body since its release. A veritable online movement erupted in the years after its theatrical debut, calling for a reappraisal of the film \u2014 again and again. At this year\u2019s Beyond Fest in Los Angeles \u2014 11 days after the official tenth anniversary of Jennifer\u2019s Body \u2014 Fox and Kusama joined me (and an audience of fans) to discuss the emotional toll of making the movie, what it felt like to be told the story needed \u201cmoar bewbs,\u201d and what it\u2019s like to revel in the film\u2019s prescient message today.\n\nKaryn, you\u2019ve talked about Jennifer\u2019s Body at various points over the years and participated in screenings before. But Megan, this is one of your first times really revisiting the work publicly. Why now?\n\nMegan Fox: I didn\u2019t really understand how it had grown since we released it. I\u2019m not online very much at all, so unless somebody takes me aside and says, \u201cThis is happening,\u201d I stay pretty much unaware of it. So I didn\u2019t really understand how the movie continued to gain fans through the years. I have in recent years noticed a lot of Jennifer Checks out at Halloween, but this year all of a sudden, there were all these requests for the ten-year anniversary and celebrating it. I started looking into it a little bit more, really understanding the impact that it\u2019s had, and I just didn\u2019t realize that it was being appreciated now the way that it is.\n\nA unique aspect of the way this movie has been revisited is that it\u2019s not just, \u201cHey, guys, this is good.\u201d The first piece I really remember coming out that sort of catalyzed this wave was one from the Mary Sue, \u201cSo, When Are We Going to Apologize to Megan Fox?\u201d Then there was a big feature from last year called \u201cYou Probably Owe Jennifer\u2019s Body an Apology.\u201d I wanted to hear your personal reactions to it being reexamined in that way.\n\nKaryn Kusama: I mean for me, and I\u2019m going to guess that I share this with Megan, I like to make my work and then move on and not really revisit the experience. Not necessarily for good or for bad, just because I like to keep moving in my life. For me, what\u2019s really gratifying about people coming back to the film and just watching it here with you guys, is it\u2019s being revisited because it\u2019s really fucking good. It\u2019s exciting for me. It\u2019s like, you know, of course the movie has its flaws and a lot of movies do. Most movies do. But I\u2019m really excited by what survives in it, what remains totally bracing and un-PC. I have to say while Megan is up here onstage with me, your performance is so layered, nuanced, and complicated. I don\u2019t think people understood how hard it is to do that role, and you did it and you made it look easy.\n\nYes. Your performance is canon.\n\nKusama: It\u2019s iconic.\n\nObviously you\u2019re giving a really fun performance, just chewing through all that Diablo Cody dialogue, but at the same time there\u2019s a through line of vulnerability that keeps us from ever turning away from Jennifer. How did you bring that duality out?\n\nFox: I\u2019m not going to sit up here and be like, \u201cYou know, when I was studying Method acting \u2026 \u201d That\u2019s not really what was going on. I think in general I\u2019m a much more vulnerable person than people realize. I\u2019m very permeable, and I was at a place in my life and in my career and dealing with fame where I felt I was really struggling with that. So I was sort of raw and very open but also trying to constantly cover it by kind of adopting a Jennifer Check\u2013esque persona in my own life, which was an affect. It wasn\u2019t really totally genuine. So, I think it just happened. I happened to be the right person to play this character at that time, because I was kind of living a microcosm of it already, if that makes sense.\n\nMegan Fox and Karyn Kusama discuss justice for Jennifer\u2019s Body at Beyond Fest. Photo: Annette DiGiovanni / BeyondFest\n\nYou recently did an interview with Diablo Cody and asked why she picked you, and she said a lot of people read for Needy, but that she always knew Jennifer was you. Then at the end of the conversation you circled back and said you also felt like you were the only person who could have played this part. Why do you think so?\n\nFox: I mean, I think that it took someone who was, like, genuinely demented at that time to play a demon-possessed man-eating teenager, and I was just at a space in my life and mentally where I could fully embody that and be okay doing it. It wasn\u2019t really an acting exercise, per se. It was just leaning into the darkest part of my own shadow. I was ready to do that at that time, because, like I said, I was already struggling against so many other things in my career, and I was like, Fuck it. Let\u2019s just go. Let\u2019s just go deep into this place where I should be hiding all of this from people. Let\u2019s just expose it.\n\nKaryn, you were the one responsible for keeping all the tonal switches throughout the movie on track and wrangling the absurdity of it all, while giving the most vulnerable parts the attention they needed, too. What was the element you\u2019d go back to as the movie\u2019s beating heart to stay grounded.\n\nKusama: It\u2019s interesting to rewatch the film after a long, long time and just realize that I was always working with really good performances. I think if the performances are honest \u2014 no matter what the tone \u2014 if there\u2019s a sense of sincerity that\u2019s not necessarily earnest, but, like, something real, it\u2019s a lot easier to navigate a bunch of tones. I was very lucky to have just so many people in the cast, from Amanda and Megan to Adam [Brody] and Johnny [Simmons].\n\nFox: Johnny was great.\n\nKusama: And Kyle Gallner. I mean, there are just so many wonderful performances. J.K. Simmons and Amy Sedaris, it goes on and on and that\u2019s such a pleasure. It is a lot of wrangling, but somehow it felt more natural to me because there was so much honesty in the performances.\n\nYou hear so much about the aftermath of this movie, but something I don\u2019t know much about is what it was like to make the movie. What was it like creating this thing before any of the backlash happened?\n\nKusama [to Fox]: What\u2019s your memory?\n\nFox: I feel like Amanda and I kind of fell into \u2014\n\nKusama: The relationship.\n\nFox: Yeah. We kind of were that relationship on set a little bit. Not quite as toxic, but we were sort of living it a little bit. I don\u2019t know. What was it like for you? I was just in it. Doing it.\n\nKusama: Megan will remember: I had my son up on set with me in Vancouver. He turned 1 while we were prepping. My husband was coming up every weekend. It was a lot of negotiating real life with the incredible privilege of getting to make a fantasy for a job. So for me it was actually a really exciting time, and it was a fun set for the most part. It was a really fun set. I mean, the sacrifice scene I remember being deeply upset by it. You were deeply upset by it. There were definitely things about it that were like disturbing at the time, but also, it\u2019s hard with dialogue that good not to have fun pretty much every day.\n\nFox [to Vulture]: Can I ask a question?\n\nAnything you want.\n\nFox [to Kusama]: For me, as an actor, you don\u2019t make a movie and [say], like, \u201cThis is gonna be epic,\u201d or \u201cThis is going to be around forever!\u201d When you were making it, were you like, This is a fucking good movie? Or did you not know until you got out of editing that it was like, All right. We did it. We made a good movie?\n\nKusama: I always felt like it would have its trouble spots. It would have its areas that I can still look at and wish were better, but ultimately the movie works, and the movie worked in my opinion. I just didn\u2019t realize how it\u2019s really provocative for people. Like, something about the way the movie was marketed and where you were in your career, where Diablo was in her career, it was kind of like we got this weird blowback before anyone had even seen the movie. It was really weird. So I always felt great about the movie, but I just try to kind of absorb failure, move on, forget about it.\n\nThe crazy thing about fan culture is that we don\u2019t. So while you guys have moved beyond Jennifer\u2019s Body in your life, we keep yelling at each other on Twitter, alternately defending your honor and shouting \u201cthank you!\u201d at people who agree with us. We\u2019ve been on an infinite loop for ten years. But Megan, Karyn mentioned the sacrifice scene and that is something you\u2019ve talked about having a very visceral experience with, and the multiple layers of bringing that victimization to the surface. Could you share a bit more about that?\n\nFox: I did that Bloody Disgusting podcast, and having people ask me all these questions and having to reflect on it, I realized a lot of things. One of the things was when I was doing that sacrifice scene, there are of course other things that I can pull from my childhood and past, but for me, that scene represented my relationship with the movie studios at the time and the studio executives and directors and just Hollywood in general, because on almost a daily basis, I felt like I was being sacrificed for their gain with almost no concern for my physical well-being. Fuck your mental or emotional well-being. That never is a question when you\u2019re a woman in Hollywood. Whatever they need to do to me or put me through, they were going to do as long as it got them that they needed. So in that moment I think it was a very visceral, very powerful, almost cathartic experience, because I was able to let out everything that I was trying to keep in and not be vulnerable and play tough and fight it. I could just surrender to it and cry and wilt and it was okay.\n\nHow did you work with her through that, Karyn?\n\nKusama: It\u2019s such a kind of meta scene. I find it really difficult to watch actually.\n\nFox: My mom still won\u2019t watch it. She can\u2019t handle it. She knows what happens \u2019cause she listened to it, but she won\u2019t watch it.\n\nKusama: Megan and I agreed before we started shooting it that she was not going to ever wink to the audience. No matter what was happening to her in terms of how other people were behaving, whether they were cracking jokes, the horror of it is that they are cracking jokes. I remember when it was over. First of all, it was exhausting, and you were like quite literally on a giant rock in the middle of the woods.\n\nFox: In Canada in the winter.\n\nKusama: In Canada in the winter at night. And it was close to the end, I believe, of our three and a half weeks of night shooting. So we were all probably a little bit demented, but Megan just gave so much. She made it so terrifying and deeply upsetting, deeply disturbing. I remember after that day, what you had said upset you so much about it when we were shooting was how everyone just kept laughing at you. Then to hear the [Brett] Kavanaugh hearings and hear Christine Blasey Ford say, \u201cAll I can remember is all these guys just laughing at me.\u201d I mean, I\u2019m getting chills just thinking about what it means for women to routinely feel like their humanity doesn\u2019t matter, and I really think Megan channeled an experience that ultimately is just too universal for a lot of women. That was something really moving to me on that day. There was something so viscerally honest about what Megan was doing.\n\nAnd Megan you said earlier this year in a New York Times interview that you have your own stories Me Too stories, but that you don\u2019t share them because you\u2019re not what a sympathetic victim looks like.\n\nFox: Yes.\n\nThat\u2019s a really fucked-up weight to carry.\n\nFox: Yeah, and I\u2019m working a lot on changing my own belief systems, because that\u2019s what informs your reality. But for me, the experience I\u2019ve had thus far in my life is that I felt if I came forward during this sort of explosion of the Me Too movement with the stories that I have \u2014 and I have a\u2019plenty \u2014 that that would be the one time it was okay to victim blame. So I was sort of in that same prison of not being able to \u2014 it\u2019s a feminist movement, right? This is the time. It\u2019s okay to be a woman. It\u2019s okay, because we\u2019re feminists, but am I accepted by feminists? Because I never felt like I was. I was the one woman where it was okay to be a feminist and be like, \u201cYeah, but not her. She\u2019s stupid and she\u2019s selfish and she\u2019s a dumb cunt and we don\u2019t like her. She deserves that, because she said this or did this.\u201d So, yeah. It is a lot to carry. But again, it\u2019s my job to reframe that experience for myself and create a different reality, \u2019cause it\u2019s easy to lean into it and be like, Oh, I\u2019m the victim and here\u2019s why. That\u2019s my been my experience so far, but I do feel like it\u2019s shifting in a good way, a positive way, but that was my relationship with the media and the public and with men and people at that time.\n\nAnd your relationship with the media around Jennifer\u2019s Body, Megan, really is inextricable from how this film was received critically and marketed by the studio. In that recent conversation you had with Diablo, she mentioned a focus group filled with men in the vaunted \u201cmales aged 18\u201324\u201d demographic, and apparently one of the insights provided was the movie needed \u201cmore bewbs.\u201d And this kind of feedback was taken seriously.\n\nKusama: And \u201cmore\u201d was spelled \u201cmoar.\u201d\n\nKaryn, you received your own message from somebody in marketing when you expressed concern about how the movie was being promoted, right?\n\n\ufeffKusama: I guess I didn\u2019t deserve full sentences, but it was something along the lines of \u2014 \u2019cause we had looked at some first drafts essentially of the trailer, and the first trailers didn\u2019t have Amanda in them \u2014\n\nFox: [Laughs.]\n\nKusama: So they didn\u2019t understand that the movie had another character, and it was so much about a friendship between Megan\u2019s character and Amanda\u2019s character. It was just so strange, because it just took away the entire story. So I wrote in a polite email, like, \u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned by the absence of our \u2026 \u201d You know, I tried to be diplomatic, and what I got back was essentially, \u201cMegan hot. Focus on Megan hot.\u201d It it was just such a strange \u2014 it was a dark time.\n\nAt that time, Diablo was coming off of Juno and her Oscar. Karyn, you started out in indie films then went from Aeon Flux into Jennifer\u2019s Body, and Megan you obviously had a lot going on at the time being in a media fire tornado. So what was it like for you both getting back to work and creative pursuits after this movie not only fizzled, but was taken down in ways that felt so set on personally belittling some of the women involved.\n\nFox: Well, we wrapped this movie, and then I went to directly to film the second Transformers. Um, and then \u2026 yeah [laughs]. Yeah, then I probably did something else in the interim, but what ended up happening, weirdly, is that I don\u2019t know if this movie got caught up in editing or what, but Transformers [Revenge of the Fallen] ended up coming out in the summer of 2009 and [Jennifer\u2019s Body] came out in the winter. I never anticipated that people would watch it and there would be a trailer where it says, like, \u201cVariety says Megan Fox is stunning! The performance of her life!\u201d I never anticipated that. I always thought that I was probably gonna get shit on, but I thought it was a good movie, so it should get some good reviews. It\u2019s still the thing I\u2019m the most proud of: this and the arc on New Girl, which was my other favorite role.\n\nSo this came out while I was on the press tour, and we had been in Canada. We landed in New York. I was doing the VMAs with Adam I think, and my publicist and agent come into the room and were like, \u201cSo there\u2019s a problem. We\u2019ve gotten like 600 phone calls from Steven Spielberg.\u201d If you don\u2019t remember, this was something we referred to as Hitler-gate. I had done an interview for a magazine and I said a whole bunch of stuff \u2014 and I feel like a lot of it was really eloquent and good \u2014 but the one thing that everybody paid attention to was I referenced, you know, Michael [Bay] can be very difficult sometimes on set, and sometimes he likes to take on the role of a dictator. And I thought it was a good colloquialism to refer to him as a Hitler.\n\nThat was not a good idea for many, many, many reasons! I was 23 or 22. It\u2019s something I grew up hearing people say. It had no anti-Semitic slant or anything like that! However, he was very upset. He didn\u2019t like it. He was like, \u201cNow anytime somebody Googles Michael Bay, it\u2019s going to say Hitler next to me!\u201d So we were in a crisis when I landed, and I didn\u2019t realize the level of the crisis, \u2019cause I felt like I already had so many crises before that. And I was supposed to start pre-production on the third of Transformers a few months after that. So, essentially a lot of things happened. People demanded apologies. I refused to apologize, blah blah blah [applause]. No, no. That doesn\u2019t make me cool! I was a stubborn kid. It would have been easier to just suck it up and go, \u201cLook, I was wrong for sharing it publicly.\u201d I could have taken responsibility for that. I didn\u2019t want to because I felt I\u2019d been so wronged in all these other ways, and I was going to stand my ground and be a Joan of Arc and get on my horse, and it was very self-righteous.\n\nSo then Jennifer\u2019s Body comes out. It gets the reviews that it gets. Then I go into production for the third Transformers with someone who was not very happy for me to be in their movie. And that didn\u2019t go well, as a lot of people probably know! What ended up happening is \u2014 and there\u2019s much debate about this still currently \u2014 essentially, we were never going to make that movie together. I happened to pull the trigger first and quit, and again, not because I\u2019m cool. I would\u2019ve gotten fired eventually anyway. I pulled the trigger first and was like, \u201cI can\u2019t live another six months like this,\u201d and I think I had, like, a psychotic breakdown, or a meltdown, because I quit and Brian [Austin Green] was like, \u201cIt\u2019s like I saw a burden just come off of your body, because now I saw you breathe for the first time in like five years.\u201d\n\nBut I had to live through the persecution in the media for at least two years after that where it wasn\u2019t just Mike. It wasn\u2019t just people in the studio who were planting stories with like Nikki Finke, or whatever that website is that everybody cares about it, because it\u2019s legitimate if you read it there. I had to go through that, and I was also really getting it from other women a lot. There was someone, a pretty legitimate journalist at the time but I forget who she was writing for, and she essentially said I should have shut my mouth and been grateful, because if it wasn\u2019t for Michael Bay I would have been acting in porn movies. And I\u2019m like, my parents are going to read that. What did I ever do to deserve to deserve that?\n\nYou were never even a \u201cscandalous\u201d figure.\n\nFox: No. I never drank. I never did drugs. I never went to clubs. I\u2019ve been in the same relationship for 15 years. I didn\u2019t understand really what it was, why people project this onto me, why I\u2019m such a mirror for people in that way sometimes. So that was my life immediately after the release of Jennifer\u2019s Body, and it was very difficult and that persisted for several years. I did do Judd Apatow\u2019s movie [This Is 40] where actually, like, two critics said, \u201cHey, she was almost kind of funny in that! She did okay!\u201d Then I went on to do Ninja Turtles and then I did New Girl, and that was the first time where I noticed there had been a shift where people were like, \u201cWow! She\u2019s actually good. She\u2019s actually a decent actress.\u201d Some people went, \u201cShe\u2019s never been a particularly funny actress,\u201d and I was like, \u201cWatch Jennifer\u2019s Body, you fuckfaces!\u201d If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve ever been, it\u2019s a comedic actress.\n\nSo that was life, and I went through it for years and felt very buried by it and had a lot of anger and frustration. But I also became a mom, and I\u2019ve had three kids since then. That\u2019s really changed my perspective and my consciousness, and caused me to grow in ways that I can\u2019t describe. It is tragic that it happened in the way that it happened, but also it\u2019s kind of amazing to sit back and go, \u201cLook at how far ahead of our time and we were. We were eight years ahead of everybody else with what we were doing and feeling and thinking and saying and speaking.\u201d So that part\u2019s cool [laughs].\n\nAnd speaking of those kinds of limits, my question for you, Karyn is, is director\u2019s jail real, and did you feel like you were in it?\n\nKusama: I mean, director\u2019s jail is real.\n\nFox: Especially if you\u2019re a woman.\n\nKusama: I was just going to say, I think it\u2019s a lot more real when you\u2019re female, but also I\u2019m a very persistent, nose-to-the-grindstone kind of person. So I just kept working. I started really seriously working in television, and started returning to the indie space. It took a while, but I made The Invitation and my last film, Destroyer. I feel very, very lucky that I even get to make movies, because it\u2019s a hard thing to do. Fewer and fewer people see them. I\u2019m so thankful that you\u2019re all here on a Sunday afternoon to watch a movie on the big screen as it should be watched. I am not saying this ironically, I am truly grateful to be here.\n\nSelect questions from the audience:\n\nI\u2019m 19, so I didn\u2019t watch this movie when it first came out, but when I first watched it I wanted to read some reviews and I was so shocked. When I was 9, apparently it was okay for a professional reviewers to go, \u201cIf you want to look at Megan Fox\u2019s body, there are better ways to do it.\u201d And, like, did you just watch the same movie as me? Because, you know, there are so few things in Hollywood that are just strong women that are actually made by women. I guess that\u2019s not really the question.\n\n\ufeffKusama: I hope that what the film is exploring is how misogyny and the power constructs of what we call the patriarchy warp everyone. It\u2019s not just men who become damaged in that system. Women become so damaged in that system. And if anything hurt about the process of releasing Jennifer\u2019s Body it was the rejection of critics who seemed to just sort of dismiss the movie and really just get on a train of humiliation-speak. They just felt a power in belittling the film and the filmmaking. That\u2019s a critic\u2019s prerogative, but I\u2019ve found it to be a really fascinating reflection of what the movie was actually about.\n\nI watched this movie when I was 14, and it was kind of like the first time that I was like, \u201cOh, shit. I think I\u2019m gay.\u201d So I just want to ask, do you think this is also like a movie about sexuality and sexual exploration?\n\nKusama: It was so crucial that the reveal was that, actually, Needy and Jennifer had a sometimes-intimate relationship, and that that is part of why it\u2019s so emotionally entangled. It\u2019s not just BFFs. It\u2019s kind of more complex than that. I felt like I got a lot of blowback for embracing the eroticism of that relationship, but for me that was part of the film\u2019s identity. I\u2019ve always embraced the idea of queerness, and I just feel like their relationship was not made more titillating for a young male audience. It was made more interesting for everyone and for the actors playing those characters, because they had a somewhat secret but deeply close relationship.\n\nFox: I think for me at least, I knew that this scene was not going to be taken for what it was intended to be going into shooting. So there was the pressure of almost anticipating the disappointment. I think I said this on the press tour or before, that the entire trailer was probably gonna be just that scene of me making out with Amanda, and it would be clickbait like, \u201cMegan Fox\u2019s First Lesbian Scene!\u201d So I think it made it hard to experience it the way I would have wanted to, because I was preoccupied with \u201cWhat is this really going to be turned into?\u201d Which, of course, it was. It was completely misunderstood. From the test, were screenings the bros were like, \u201cYeah!\u201d and bro-ing out over it?\n\nKusama: The irony is that I think that the scene is both erotic and really scary, because at this point you see Jennifer\u2019s power and so we\u2019re not sure where this is exactly going.\n\nFox: Maybe that\u2019s where they thought there should be more boobs.", "description": "Megan Fox and director Karyn Kusama talk about the 10-year anniversary of their film Jennifer\u2019s Body, the emotional toll of making the movie, what it felt like to be told the story needed \u201cmoar bewbs,\u201d and how they feel about its cult status today.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/30/30-jennifers-body.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
