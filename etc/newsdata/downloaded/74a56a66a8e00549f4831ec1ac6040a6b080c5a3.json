An education in budgeting, spending and, if you were that kind of kid, delayed gratification.\n\nIt affords children a sense of freedom, self-determination and enough sugar to make them vomit.\n\nThese days though, the notion of putting physical money in those small-scale pockets is a dying one.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAlmost one in three parents now pay pocket money digitally, straight into their bank account. Among those with children over the age of 14, it\u2019s half.\n\nThe tooth fairy now transfers money online in return for more than one in 10 of those tiny pearls left under hopeful pillows, according to research by comparison site money.co.uk.\n\nPiggy banks are dying out in favour of current accounts, prepaid cards, vouchers and even eBay credit.\n\nWith today\u2019s under 14s receiving an average yearly pocket money income of \u00a3241.28, or \u00a34.64 a week, and even four-year-olds getting an average of \u00a32.38 a week, convenience, safety and teaching children to budget are the main reasons parents have turned digital with pocket money payments, the survey found.\n\n\u201cCashless payments can make life much easier, but there are understandable concerns that children might accidentally blow months of careful saving in just a few taps of a screen, or flashes of a card,\u201d acknowledges Clint Wilson, founder of prepaid children\u2019s card and app Nimbl.\n\n\u201cIn a digital world, it can be easy to lose sight of the value of money, especially when children will no longer be able to tell how much money they have left by how much their pocket jangles.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no reason to fear cashless payments or try to shield children from them. Rather, we need to make sure that children are introduced to digital money early, with practical hands-on lessons to encourage responsible behaviour. After all, you wouldn\u2019t teach your child how to use a typewriter instead of a computer, so why do the same with money? At its core, digital banking empowers children.\u201d\n\nMoney mechanism\n\nOf course, the way kids are accessing and managing their money is also evolving rapidly.\n\nChildren can operate traditional current accounts from the age of 11, though some won\u2019t let you apply until the age of 16, especially without parental involvement. Children\u2019s accounts don\u2019t allow overdrafts, they typically come with a debit card (with your permission if the child is under 16) that offers most if not all of the same functions as an adult\u2019s card \u2013 such as contactless payments and use of ATMs \u2013 and the use of the bank\u2019s own (not always age-appropriate) banking app.\n\nThe account holder may also be able to set up direct debits and standing orders, depending on their age and the type of account. That\u2019s one of the reasons they\u2019re good for showing children how \u201creal\u201d banking works, alongside the potential to earn interest on their balance.\n\nConsumer group Which? includes challenger Monzo, building society Nationwide and struggling Metro among its top choices, as well as Santander and Barclays.\n\nBut the extra control features for both child and parent of prepaid cards and their associated apps are becoming increasingly popular. Pockit, Nimbl, Osper and gohenry all offer child-specific prepaid cards.\n\nA parent or carer must apply for the card for children as young as six in some cases and can set up a range of controls and restrictions on them, such as the amount of money that can be withdrawn from ATMs or spent each day. Because they are prepaid, the child can\u2019t spend past a \u00a30 balance.\n\nSpending with age-inappropriate retailers are usually automatically blocked and the responsible adult can set up notifications to see how and where the child is using their money. The card can also be frozen by the adult if it is lost or stolen.\n\nThe personalised functionality of these cards frankly blows the traditional account out of the water but it comes at a cost. Watch out for monthly, ATM and other charges, which can quickly add up.\n\nPrepaid cards don\u2019t give you quite the same protection as money held in a bank account. Your cash will be protected against the card issuer going bust because it has to be held in a separate account to the provider\u2019s operating cash. But if the bank or building society that account is held with goes bust, you\u2019d lose your money, unlike cash held by you in a bank account.\n\nAnd because they\u2019re not credit cards, spending covered under the Consumer Credit Act doesn\u2019t apply here either, though you may have some protection under Visa or Mastercard arrangements depending on the product.", "description": "Pocket money.
