And while the city has done everything in its power to try and educate foreign tourists on proper manners when visiting, they have largely been unsuccessful.\n\nTourists trespassing on private property to take photos, grabbing geisha and maiko (geisha in training) to take pictures with them, and overall wrecking the atmosphere of the area is still a real problem.\n\nAnd now one district in Kyoto, the Gion District, is putting their geta-sandal foot down. Starting on the 25th of this month, an association made up of local residents and shop owners has forbidden photography on private roads.\n\n\u25bc So while pictures taken from the famous Hanamikoji Main Street, pictured here, are okay, many private roads leading off it are not.\n\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons/663highland\n\nResidents have been putting up bulletins informing visitors of the change. They are also passing out leaflets reminding them not to take unsolicited photos of geisha and maiko, and asking them to use good manners while in the area.\n\nApparently video surveillance is also being used, so even if violators are not caught right away, they could still be tracked down later.\n\nWhile a fine of 10,000 yen has been put in place for those who violate the ordinance, it has not been made clear yet how it will be enforced, whether it will be by police, members of the committee, volunteers, or another organization. Hopefully just the signs alone with be effective in deterring most of the would-be photographers.\n\nHere\u2019s how Japanese netizens reacted to the development:\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t get better then the laws are just gonna get worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more that people visit, the more than there will be people who don\u2019t have manners.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs someone who loves photography and Kyoto, I\u2019m sad, but I support them protecting the atmosphere of Gion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks a lot, dumb tourists, for ruining it for the rest of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, if they don\u2019t enforce the fine, then people are just gonna ignore it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute. If the fine is only 10,000 yen, then won\u2019t there be tourists who just see it as a fee to pay to get whatever photos they want?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly. It\u2019s just 10,000 yen for All You Can Photo Anywhere You Want.\u201d\n\nOnly time will tell if the fine does its intended job. But seeing as Gion has endured hardships before to keep its traditions alive, hopefully everything will turn out fine this time too.\n\nSource: NHK News Web via My Game News Flash\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- 10 things you didn\u2019t know about geisha\n\n-- Spirited Away train station and submerged tracks attract Ghibli fans around Japan\n\n-- Kyoto hotel\u2019s Maiko-han Bar event lets travelers drink with geisha at amazingly affordable prices\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/27/kyotos-popular-tourist-spot-gion-to-forbid-photos-on-private-roads-10000-yen-fine-to-violators/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "For years, Kyoto has been fighting an uphill battle against the millions of tourists that flock to see its living time capsule of traditional Japan every year.
