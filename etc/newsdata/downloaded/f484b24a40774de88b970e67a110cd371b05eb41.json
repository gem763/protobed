REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nParliament, locked in a three-year battle over how, if or when the country should leave the European Union, reached boiling point on Wednesday when Johnson and his opponents spent hours hurling allegations of betrayal and deceit across the chamber of the House of Commons.\n\nOpposition MPs accused Johnson of stoking hatred and cast him as a cheating dictator. One called him a liar. Johnson dismissed death threats against female MPs as \u201chumbug\u201d and accused his opponents of \u201csurrender\u201d to European leaders.\n\nBritain\u2019s leading bishops said on Friday this behaviour must stop.\n\nBut Dominic Cummings, adviser to the prime minister and mastermind of the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, said MPs seeking to thwart Brexit should not be surprised by the reception they receive around the country.\n\n\u201cIf you are a bunch of politicians and you say that we swear we are going to respect the result of a democratic vote and after you lose you say \u2018we don\u2019t want to respect that vote\u2019. What do you expect will happen?\u201d Cummings said at a book launch on Thursday night, reported by the Daily Telegraph.\n\n\u201cI find it very odd that these characters are complaining that people are unhappy about their behaviour now.\u201d\n\nJohnson, the public face of the Vote Leave campaign, has also said that tempers need to calm down and that resolving Brexit would \u201clance the boil\u201d.\n\nThe Conservative Party elected him as leader in July on his promise to break the impasse and take Britain out of the bloc by Oct. 31.\n\nBut he has faced defeat at every turn, losing his parliamentary majority, every vote in the legislature, and a groundbreaking case in the Supreme Court over his decision to suspend the assembly.\n\nThree years since Britons voted to leave the EU, the outcome remains mired in uncertainty with possible outcomes ranging from a departure with a new divorce deal, a no-deal exit, a second referendum, or no Brexit at all.\n\nCummings rejected a suggestion that the government would back a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d - one that keeps Britain more closely aligned to EU rules - in order to get a deal by Johnson\u2019s October deadline.\n\nDespite the uncertainty and turmoil, Cummings said they were not under any pressure and the situation was far less difficult than winning the 2016 referendum.\n\n\u201cThis is a walk in the park compared to that. All the Vote Leave team, we are enjoying this, we are going to win, we are going to leave, don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said.\n\nCummings has been cast by allies as a ruthless strategist who cares little for the conventions of traditional British politics and by enemies as an anarchist.\n\nHe was found to be in contempt of parliament earlier this year for failing to appear before lawmakers investigating \u201cfake news\u201d and the referendum. He said he had offered to appear and give evidence.\n\nAlso on Friday, Church of England bishops called for respect on all sides of the Brexit argument, saying the language being used in the increasingly vitriolic debate was divisive and abusive.\n\n\u201cWe should speak to others with respect. And we should also listen,\u201d the bishops said. \u201cIn the last few days, the use of language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has been unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBREXIT OR ELECTION\n\nJohnson challenged his opponents on Wednesday either to bring down the government or get out of the way to allow him to deliver Brexit, something he has vowed to do by Oct. 31 whether or not he has agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union.\n\nJean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said he and the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier were doing all they could to get a Brexit deal, and if they failed it would be Britain\u2019s fault.\n\nWith the clock ticking down, opposition parties have forced through a law that would order the prime minister to ask Brussels for a three-month Brexit delay unless he can strike a deal. Johnson has labelled the law a \u201cSurrender Bill\u201d and said he will never ask for an extension.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures as he speaks at the parliament, which reconvenes after the UK Supreme Court ruled that his suspension of the parliament was unlawful, in London, Britain, September 25, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video.
