It's alleged that he held back $391 million in military aid for Ukraine, and asked the country's president to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden \u2014 in a bid to help his own reelection.\n\nBefore Pelosi's announcement, Trump denied that charge, but acknowledged he blocked the funds, later released. However on Wednesday, the Trump administration released a summary of the July call that showed Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate whether Biden \u2014 while he was vice-president \u2014 shut down an investigation into a company that employed his son.\n\nTo discuss why the lessons of history \u2014 and why the Democrats are acting now \u2014 The Current's guest host Laura Lynch spoke to Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian and the founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, Texas. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nU.S. House Speaker said Tuesday the House of Representatives will launch a formal impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump over the Ukraine affair. 5:59\n\nIt's interesting that Pelosi chose this moment and this aspect of his presidency to start an impeachment inquiry, because there's been many other calls for his impeachment over the last several months.\n\nWe still haven't seen the transcript from the phone call, we haven't heard from the whistleblower, we don't even know who it is. Why would she move forward, not knowing exactly what the case is going to be? [Editor's note: the Trump administration released a summary of the call on Wednesday.]\n\nWell, you know, here I think history actually provides some guide. There's only been of course a handful of cases of impeachment \u2014 or in the case of Richard Nixon near-impeachment, leading to resignation \u2014 in the nation's history. But they have one thing in common, which is that each of them centres in many ways around a president defying the will of Congress.\n\nAnd so I think what really brought this to a head in many ways for Pelosi was the administration's refusal, which is still somewhat ongoing to release the full details of the whistleblower report.\n\nNow, the law on this is very clear: that if there is a whistleblower and if the director of national intelligence determines that this is actually something that is a critical issue, the information is required to go to Congress. And consequently when President Trump's administration is at this point not conceding a full version, that's essentially the president thumbing his nose, if you will, at Congress.\n\nWhenever we see congressional prerogatives \u2014 especially in the realm of national security \u2014 violated so blatantly, that's the sort of thing that a congressional leader simply can't turn her back on.\n\nBut this White House has done that time and again, refusing to allow witnesses to testify and not turning over documentation. Is it simply that this case is an easier one for Americans to grasp?\n\nI think it's an easier one and it's also potentially the most blatant, in the sense that this is something that involves national security. It's as you say easy to grasp, and there is that unknown, which of course neither you nor I nor hardly anyone in the world knows, of what the whistleblower might be actually saying or what evidence he or she might actually be bringing to bear.\n\nWhatever it is, it appears to be enough to cause the entire government to essentially stop and focus on what they are saying.\n\nThis is actually remarkable that we've gone down this road as a country time and again for the last two-and-a-half years. Why is this time different? It appears just to have been enough.\n\nImpeachment is the political process of removing from office certain elected or public officials accused of wrongdoing. The process is more difficult than you might think. 2:01\n\nHow is the [Republican] leadership viewing the impeachment inquiry?\n\nThey appear to be trying to do the same playbook they've been doing for the last two-and-a-half years, which is to say any critique against Donald Trump's actions as president are really critiques about the outcome of the 2016 election. It's sour grapes or a witch hunt, as the president would say.\n\nI think that's one of the reasons why this appears to be a different case. This case, unlike the Mueller investigation, and unlike previous scandals and near-scandals that the president was involved in, has nothing to do whatsoever with 2016. This is about his time in office and about going forward.\n\nSo at this point Republicans are to some extent circling the wagons. But I do have to say here's another place where history is a little bit of a guide.\n\nRichard Nixon \u2014 who of course resigned under pressure of impeachment \u2014 was himself, like Trump, tremendously popular with Republicans. He actually was relatively popular with the country as a whole throughout the whole of 1974. He of course resigned in August.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, once his support eroded however, once that piece of evidence came out that seemed just too believable to be discounted, his support evaporated almost overnight. Within 72 hours or so Nixon went from believing he had more than 40 votes in the Senate on his behalf down to about 15. That's what caused his resignation, which is to say when the dam of support breaks, it can break in a hurry.\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran, with files from The Associated Press.
