They revealed more details about the PlayStation 5\u2014and, yes, it will be called the PS5\u2014to Wired today as well as announcing more about the console on the company\u2019s blog. Here\u2019s the key info:\n\nIt\u2019ll be called the PS5 and be out for holiday 2020, as we\u2019ve been reporting.\n\nThe console will have a solid-state drive. Games will be released on 100GB discs.\n\nAs with games this generation, they\u2019ll need to be installed from the disc, though Sony is now saying that players will have more granular control of which parts of a game they install or uninstall\u2014campaign, multiplayer, etc.\n\nThe PS5's revised user interface will show more information about what can be done in a game, including the availability of multiplayer matches.\n\nWired\u2019s writer held a prototype of the new PS5 controller and wrote that it seems similar to a PS4 controller. It will include a speaker and\u2014here comes some of that kind of language you\u2019ll be seeing a reporters and game makers start talking about next-gen hardware\u2014\u201c\u2018adaptive triggers\u2019\u201d that can offer varying levels of resistance to make shooting a bow and arrow feel like the real thing.\u201d\n\nWired was also impressed with the improved haptics/rumble in the controller, reporting this of their time playing the PS4 VR game Astrobot Rescue Mission with it: \u201cOn ice, a high-frequency response made the thumbsticks really feel like my character was gliding. Jumping into a pool, I got a sense of the resistance of the water; on a wooden bridge, a bouncy sensation.\u201d\n\nFor those of you who stocked up on micro USB wires for charging PS4 controllers, too bad! The PS5 controllers will be charged with USB Type-C.\n\nOne studio that is now confirmed as a PS5 developer is Bluepoint Games, makers of the 2018 Shadow of the Colossus remake. Said studio president Marco Thrush to Wired: \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re working on a big one right now...I\u2019ll let you figure out the rest.\u201d Uh. Hmm. Clearly a tease that Sony has bought the rights to F-Zero and is making a new one. Thrush was enthusiastic about the speedier loading that comes with an SSD, noting that there\u2019d be less reason to slow players down in hallways and doorways to mask the loading of new levels.", "description": "Sony isn\u2019t waiting for any more leaks.
