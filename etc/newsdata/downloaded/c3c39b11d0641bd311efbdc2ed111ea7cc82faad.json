In the picture, she poses without any clothing, crouching in some tall grass with her arms covering her breasts.\n\n\"Here I am at 73 in my Birthday Suit!!!\" she captioned the snap.\n\nThe post sent a shockwave amongst her many followers. While most simply wished her a happy birthday, some praised the actress for bearing it all in the racy picture.\n\nJOHN RITTER\u2019S SON, WIDOW SHARE MEMORIES OF LATE \u2018THREE\u2019S COMPANY\u2019 STAR: \u2018HE WAS SUCH A LOVING DAD\u2019\n\n\u201cYou go girl! Way to rock your 70\u2019s. So inspirational!!\u201d one user wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cLove this!!! Appreciate you being an example of the importance of loving our bodies and still feeling sexy at any age!\u201d another user said.\n\n\u201cYou look amazing! Happy birthday and I hope you do this every year at any age as I know you\u2019ll always be beautiful and most women don\u2019t have the guts!\u201d a Facebook user shared.\n\n\u201cBravo. And to those who criticize, her pose is no different than being in a bikini. We should all hope to look this great & be this healthy at the same age .. Suzanne is an inspiration!\u201d someone else shared.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, chastised her for the risque snap. Many who were upset by the nude picture were quick to note her age as a factor.\n\n\u2018THREE\u2019S COMPANY\u2019 ACTOR RICHARD KLINE RECALLS BEFRIENDING JOHN RITTER: \u2018HE WAS JUST THE ALL-AMERICAN BOY\u2019\n\n\u201cWhy...you are too old to be acting like this,\u201d someone wrote in part on Instagram.\n\n\u201cToo old to be modeling in your birthday suit. If I was to do that I would get the same remarks,\u201d someone else shared.\n\n\u201cWhy would she do that? Not a pretty sight,\u201d someone wrote on Facebook. \u201cShe was so beautiful. Shots and surgeries change their faces too much. Surprised she didn\u2019t get a boob lift also. Oh, well, to each his own.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow I don\u2019t want to see that put some clothes on Susie,\u201d a more blunt user noted.\n\nSomers, however, seems undeterred by the online hate. Roughly 20 years ago, the star wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d make it to 73 after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000. She explained to People that she decided to forgo chemotherapy treatment in favor of a more holistic lifestyle.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI just thought, I\u2019m going to win this my way, I\u2019m going to change my life,\u201d Somers recalled. \u201c\u2026 And I\u2019m going to eliminate as many chemicals from my life, my lifestyle and diet, as I can possibly consume. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. There\u2019s not one chemical in our house and you can feel it when you walk in.\u201d\n\nFox News' Stephanie Nolasco contributed to this report.", "description": "Social media users have strong opinions on former \u201cThree\u2019s Company\u201d actress Suzanne Somers\u2019 recent post celebrating her 73rd birthday in nothing but her \u201cbirthday suit.\u201d", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/suzanne-somers-threes-company-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
