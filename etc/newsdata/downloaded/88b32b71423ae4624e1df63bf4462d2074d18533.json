Mr Bercow declined to comment.\n\nThe election of the next Speaker takes place on November 4.\n\nNine candidates, nine very different people and, possibly, with very different views on life. Each, however, united by one common goal: to restore dignity to the role of Speaker of the House of Commons.\n\nAll those who\u2019ve put their names forward to replace John Bercow, whose ten-year reign of terror belatedly comes to an end next month, held a hustings in the Palace of Westminster yesterday.\n\nThey gathered in a vast committee room which, for 90 minutes, bore a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, not least as there was a lot on which the candidates agreed.\n\nJohn Bercow is a \u2018playground bully\u2019 who has made the country \u2018ungovernable\u2019, MPs running to replace him said yesterday. As the nine candidates spoke at a hustings event in Westminster, the outgoing Commons Speaker was one subject almost all were united on\n\nNearly all concurred that the current occupant of the chair, which is made out of black beanwood from Australia, had carved out too high a profile for himself. In other words, a rampant self-publicist.\n\nAll, that is, except Labour\u2019s ex-deputy leader Harriet Harman, who thinks he\u2019s wonderful. Hattie\u2019s the continuity candidate: Bercow in a blouse.\n\nThe favourite, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, best known as the cheery Lancastrian who stands in on Budget Day, said little of interest. Since the contest is his to lose, this was eminently sensible. Sir Lindsay said his main aim was to \u2018make this place \u2018appy\u2019 \u2013 an admission that under Bercow it certainly is not.\n\nThe issue of Bercow\u2019s impartiality drew some wishy-washy answers. Sir Henry Bellingham (Con, NW Norfolk), that congenial, Trumper\u2019s-scented ornament to the lower chamber, thought he\u2019d been a good Speaker but admitted he was prone to favouritism.\n\nAll, that is, except Labour\u2019s ex-deputy leader Harriet Harman, who thinks he\u2019s wonderful. Hattie\u2019s the continuity candidate: Bercow in a blouse\n\nShailesh Vara (Con, NW Cambridgeshire) was the only candidate prepared to put some welly in, describing Bercow as a \u2018playground bully\u2019. His contempt was palpable throughout. For me, the former solicitor was the surprise package.\n\nBercow\u2019s refusal to stand down despite having originally promised to go last year was universally deemed a mistake. Sir Edward Leigh (Con, Gainsborough) said it had \u2018done a lot of harm\u2019.\n\nFive to seven years, they all agreed, was quite long enough in the job.\n\nChris Bryant (Lab, Rhondda) said the Commons could be more family-friendly if sessions weren\u2019t allowed to run on so long. All agreed PMQs should be reined in to half an hour, except for Meg Hillier (Lab, Hackney South), a delicate flower, who thought they should be extended to an hour.\n\nBryant was also scathing about Bercow\u2019s rudeness, though added that his predecessor Michael Martin could be so foul to women it made him retch.\n\nNine candidates, nine very different people and, possibly, with very different views on life. Each, however, united by one common goal: to restore dignity to the role of Speaker of the House of Commons (L-R: Chris Bryant, Harriet Harman, Meg Hilliers, Dame Eleanor Laing, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Rosie Winterton, Shailesh Vara, Sir Henry Bellingham and Edward Leigh)\n\nAs for uniforms, only Sir Henry pledged to wear tights and a wig, the traditional court dress abandoned by Bercow.\n\nHe was also one of the few candidates not to make a great play of his roots. But as an Old Etonian and grouse moor habitu\u00e9, this was probably wise.\n\nA question about pay and perks rattled the cutlery a bit. Hillier and Dame Rosie Winterton (Lab, Doncaster Central) breezily claimed they didn\u2019t know what the position paid. Yeah, right! The Speaker\u2019s \u00a3152,000 salary is more than the Prime Minister\u2019s, which everyone agreed was inappropriate.\n\nThankfully, there was universal opposition to the ghastly clapping which has crept into the chamber.\n\nAlso, Winterton said slogan-bearing T-shirts should be prohibited.\n\nHattie Harman suddenly went quiet. Perhaps she recalled that she once wore in the Commons one of those \u2018This Is What A Feminist Looks Like\u2019 tops which it subsequently emerged were made by female sweatshop workers in Mauritius who were paid just 62p an hour and slept 16 to a room.\n\nWhen someone raised the thorny issue of breastfeeding in the Chamber, Sir Henry reacted as though he\u2019d been popped in the eye with a pea shooter. It was a definite \u2018No\u2019 from him. Poor fellow looked like he needed a large Bell\u2019s.\n\nHarman and Hillier were keen. Sensible deputy speaker Eleanor Laing, demurely attired in fetching green, asked why breast-feeding in the chamber was even necessary. She\u2019d raised two children as an MP and coped just fine. Harriet shot her an unsisterly glare.\n\nA killjoy journalist asked whether it was right that cut-price beer was available in the Commons bars. Sir Edward admitted there was far too much boozing on the estate. Perhaps, he suggested with surely faux sincerity, MPs should try to emulate lobby journalists in their sobriety.\n\nThe new Speaker is announced November 4. On yesterday\u2019s showing, he or she will be a vast improvement on the current tainted occupant.", "description": "Nine candidates, nine very different people and, possibly, with very different views on life.
