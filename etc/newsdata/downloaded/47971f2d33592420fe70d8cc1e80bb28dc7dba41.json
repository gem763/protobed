And with the crime rate in our country, we suspect it\u2019s another heartbreaking crime story,\u201d says the niece of the Mamelodi man who has been missing since last week.\n\nTumagole Modiba (62) was last seen at Silverton Shopping Centre around 10am on Tuesday 15 October.\n\nAccording to Tumagole\u2019s niece, Tebogo Modiba, her uncle had parked his vehicle at the car wash next to Uitkyk butchery in Silverton before he went missing.\n\n\u201cHe then phoned his fianc\u00e9e to meet up so they can go buy meat as she works at the same complex.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe waited for quite some time and he didn\u2019t arrive,\u201d she explains.\n\nThe police spokesperson, captain Jan Sepato, told Pretoria East Rekord that his partner became suspicious and called him. When he answered the phone, he had told his fianc\u00e9e that he was on his way back home.\n\n\u201cShe was unconvinced by the manner [in which] he spoke and decided to look for him at the car wash,\u201d the captain told Pretoria East Rekord.\n\nTebogo said when she went to check on his vehicle at the car wash, they were still busy cleaning it.\n\n\u201cShe then phoned his number again, it rang, then someone dropped it.\u201d\n\nAnd eventually it was off after trying numerous times.\n\nThat\u2019s when the family notified the police, who went to his workplace but he was nowhere to be found.\n\nTebogo says money has been withdrawn from her uncle\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThe police managed to retrieve a copy of his bank statement from the bank on Friday,\u201d she confirms.\n\nThe 62-year-old has been working at Ford South Africa and has been described as a \u201cvery humble, sociable and loving person\u201d.\n\nHe recently paid lobola for his partner after his first wife died in 2011.\n\n\u201cHis fianc\u00e9e is devasted, just as the rest of the family,\u201d Tebogo tells us.\n\n\u201cWe went to hospitals and government mortuaries to look for him this past weekend. We\u2019re praying for his safe return.\u201d\n\nThe police believe the man may have been abducted and forced to withdraw cash.\n\nExtra sources: Pretoria East Rekord", "description": "According to Tumagole\u2019s niece, Tebogo Modiba, her uncle had parked his vehicle at the car wash next to Uitkyk butchery in Silverton before he went missing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9501/366f7756530d446b8180c70628e6291a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
