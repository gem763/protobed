Also, it was the tallest structure in the world until 1889, when the Eiffel Tower was completed in Paris, France. It is still the tallest structure in Washington.\n\n\u2022 Height: 555 feet, 5 1/8 inches \u2022 Completed: 1884 \u2022 Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nAt the top is an aluminum capstone with inscriptions, lightning rods and red aircraft warning lights.\n\nThe new elevator takes visitors to an observation deck in 70 seconds. From windows on all four sides, viewers can see not just all of Washington (including the Mall, White House and U.S. Capitol) but also as far as Maryland and Virginia.\n\nElevator inside the monument\n\nIf you look closely, the color of the lower part of the monument appears different from the portion above it. The bottom part was built with one type of stone from 1848 to 1854. Construction then stopped for 22 years because of a lack of money and the Civil War. The top part used different types of stones and was built from 1876 to 1884.\n\nHeight of U.S. Capitol building\n\nBuilt after 1876\n\nStone rubble and mortar\n\nDetail of lower wall construction\n\nBuilt before 1854\n\nInner walls\n\nOuter walls\n\nInside the lower part of the monument the walls are not solid.
