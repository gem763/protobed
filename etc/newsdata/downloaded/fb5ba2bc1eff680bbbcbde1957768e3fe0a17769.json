ObamaCare premiums are dropping for 2020, Warren and Buttigieg have swapped positions on Medicare for All, and drug companies are spending millions on lobbying as Congress seeks to reign in their profits.\n\nWe'll start with ObamaCare:\n\nObamaCare premiums dropping for 2020\n\nThe Trump administration is touting its success running a program it has actively tried to end, as a number of ObamaCare plans will be cheaper in the upcoming open enrollment period.\n\nAccording to new administration figures, average premiums for Affordable Care Act insurance plans will decrease 4 percent in 2020, and there will be more insurers participating in states that use the federal exchange.\n\nThe 4 percent decline marks just the second year in a row that premiums have decreased since the law took effect in 2014.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there will be 175 different insurers offering plans in 2020, compared to 132 in 2018. Only two states will have a single insurer in 2020, compared to five states that had only one insurer in 2019.\n\nMarket correction: Insurance companies took a few years to figure out how to make a profit on the exchanges in the final years of the Obama administration, and premiums reflected that. In 2017, the first year the Trump administration was responsible for the law, insurance companies implemented massive double-digit premium hikes, citing concerns about the elimination of the individual mandate, short-term plans and cuts to ObamaCare's outreach and advertising budget. Experts argue this year's numbers are a sign that the market is stabilizing,and is basically a market correction.\n\nContemptuous language: The health law's seventh open enrollment season begins Nov. 1, and while Trump administration officials openly decry the law, they also said they are focused on making it work. \"The ACA simply doesn't work and it is still unaffordable for far too many. But until Congress gets around to replacing it, President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Veterans group backs lawsuits to halt Trump's use of military funding for border wall Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.\n\nRead more on the figures here.\n\nWarren, Buttigieg shift stances in battle over 'Medicare for All'\n\nSen.

But they both have not been entirely consistent.\n\nButtigieg praised Medicare for All earlier this year, but now is attacking Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for supporting the plan.\n\nWarren, meanwhile, previously expressed openness to \"different pathways\" toward Medicare for All, including optional \"buy-ins.\" She has since pivoted to a full-throated defense of a single-payer system.\n\nThe politics: Buttigieg is trying to be the candidate of the moderate lane who could overtake former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Warren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE.

Republicans think they can turn health care into a winning issue in the next election by drawing a contrast to \"Medicare for All\" and other single-payer proposals currently being debated by Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nBut the plan itself essentially rehashes many of the past Republican efforts to replace the Affordable Care Act. It would allow states to decide which \"essential health benefits\" to cover, remove the ban on annual and lifetime limits on covered benefits and would remove the law's rules that plans cover certain preventive services for free.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCourt settlement sets stage for broader opioid deal\n\nIt was major news yesterday when three of the country's top drug distributors and a drug manufacturer announced an eleventh-hour settlement to avoid a trial. The $260 million settlement between McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. -- the \"Big Three\" distributors -- manufacturer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Summit and Cuyahoga counties in Ohio --would net only a fraction of what the counties were seeking, but legal experts said it could set the bar for other settlements in the future.\n\nOf course, the sense of an impending trial creates a different sense of urgency, but experts said it felt like a bar, of sorts, was set.\n\n\"There are now thousands of cases, but this will set a precedent on pricing,\" said Ekow Yankah, a professor at Cardozo School of Law. \"This, to me, sets a baseline market rate for liability, and only the people who really want to gamble are the ones who will take the next phase to trial.\"\n\nJust hours later, the same companies, along with Johnson & Johnson, announced they had agreed in principle to a $48 billion global settlement with North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas. Those states are pushing for others to join in quickly. According to University of Kentucky law professor Richard Ausness, if the other states do not agree to the settlement, they will take nothing under it, and will have to litigate or settle with the defendants separately.\n\nRead more here.\n\nVerma to push back on Democrats' claims Trump 'sabotaged' ObamaCare\n\nSeema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will push back on Democrats' claims that President Trump \"sabotaged\" the Affordable Care Act during her testimony on the hill Wednesday.\n\n\"Under President Trump's direction, the Administration acted to promote market stability, increase competition, and provide states additional tools and flexibility to meet the needs of their residents and promote more affordable coverage,\" Verma will say to the House Energy & Commerce Committee's Oversight panel, according to her prepared remarks.\n\nShe will also say premiums are \"too high\" and customers who don't get subsidies to buy insurance are \"fleeing\" the market.\n\nWhy it matters: The title of the hearing is \"Sabotage: The Trump administration's attack on health care.\" Democrats are unlikely to buy her remarks.\n\nRead Verma's full statement here.\n\nSponsored Content - Partnership for America's Health Care Future\n\nIndependent studies estimate the cost of some one-size-fits-all health care proposals could more than double income taxes for every American family.
