The mystery could lead to a \u201cnew physics,\u201d according to another researcher.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThe universe is expanding much faster than scientists predicted, and nobody knows why.\n\nA team of researchers have confirmed this dilemma with data gathered using a new telescope technology that relies on shape-shifting mirrors. According to their study, which was published last month in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, precise measurements of the rate at which the universe is expanding don\u2019t match the standard model that scientists have been using for decades.\n\n\u201cTherein lies the crisis in cosmology,\u201d Chris Fassnacht, an astrophysicist and co-author of the study, said in a press release.\n\nOther studies published earlier this year reached similar conclusions.\n\n\u201cThis mismatch has been growing and has now reached a point that is really impossible to dismiss as a fluke. This disparity could not plausibly occur just by chance,\u201d Adam Riess, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist behind a study that came out in April, said in a press release at the time.\n\nHe added that these findings \u201cmay be the most exciting development in cosmology in decades.\u201d\n\nThe mystery of the Hubble Constant\n\nThe universe is always getting bigger, stretching galaxies farther apart. For decades, scientists have attempted to measure how fast the universe is growing \u2013 a number called the Hubble Constant.\n\nResearchers piece together the universe\u2019s history by studying the glow of radiation left over from the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, called the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\n\nWhen scientists study the CMB, they\u2019re looking both far into the distance and far into the past, since light travels at a constant speed. When we look at the sun, for example, what we see on Earth is the sun as it appeared 8 minutes ago, since it\u2019s about 8 light-minutes away. So when scientists look at objects far enough in the distance, they see them as they were at the beginning of the universe.\n\nBased on those observations, scientists have found that after the Big Bang, the universe at first expanded very quickly. Then the expansion slowed as the gravity of dark matter \u2060- a mysterious, invisible force that makes up about 85% of all matter in the universe \u2060- pulled back.\n\nBICEP2 COLLABORATION/CERN/NASA An artist\u2019s depiction of the standard model of cosmology.\n\nBut recently, they have run into a problem.\n\nMeasurements of the contemporary universe show it\u2019s expanding much faster than the standard model predicts. Riess\u2019 April study found that the universe is expanding 9% faster than predicted by calculations based on the CMB.\n\n\u201cThis is not just two experiments disagreeing,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe are measuring something fundamentally different. One is a measurement of how fast the universe is expanding today, as we see it. The other is a prediction based on the physics of the early universe and on measurements of how fast it ought to be expanding. If these values don\u2019t agree, there becomes a very strong likelihood that we\u2019re missing something.\u201d\n\nNew technology confirmed the dilemma \u2013 but we\u2019re no closer to solving it\n\nW.M. Keck Observatory The Keck I and Keck II telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers used a cutting-edge mirror system at the Keck Observatory telescope in Hawaii. The device uses flexible mirrors that can correct for distortions caused by Earth\u2019s atmosphere and return extra-sharp images of objects in the sky.\n\nThe researchers pointed the telescope toward three systems of bright, highly active galaxies \u2060called quasars.\n\nThey studied the quasars using a process called gravitational lensing, which measures the way light gets bent as it travels around massive objects on its way toward Earth. A massive object (like a giant galaxy, say) bends light in a variety of directions, which allows scientists to see different, distorted versions of the same quasar from slightly different times in its past. They can then compare those various images to calculate how long a quasar\u2019s light takes to reach us and gather information about how much the universe expanded during that travel time.\n\nLike the previous studies, the new results showed that the universe is expanding more rapidly than the standard model predicts. The researchers compared their results to data from the Hubble Space Telescope, and the findings were consistent.\n\n\u201cA difference in the Hubble constant between early and late-time universe means that there is something missing in our current standard model,\u201d astrophysicist Sherry Suyu said in a press release about the recent study. \u201cFor example, it could be exotic dark energy, or a new relativistic particle, or some other new physics yet to be discovered.\u201d\n\nNASA Goddard A computer animation of what the Big Bang might have looked like.\n\nScientists don\u2019t yet know what that missing piece could be. Some think the culprit could be dark energy, the term for the mysterious, unseen force that makes up about 68% of the universe. This energy could have sped up expansion as it pushed outward and overwhelmed the gravity of dark matter.\n\nFassnacht said he hopes scientists will continue to employ this new telescope technology to gather more precise data as they search for missing pieces in their understanding of the universe.\n\n\u201cPerhaps this will lead us to a more complete cosmological model of the universe,\u201d he said.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
