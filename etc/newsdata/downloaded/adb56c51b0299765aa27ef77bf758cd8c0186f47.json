Google said that its Soli radar sensors will be used for advanced facial recognition that will be more efficient and seamless than existing facial recognition sensors.\n\nsource Google\n\nFor example, the Pixel 4 will detect that you\u2019ll want to unlock the phone before you even pick it up, and it\u2019ll be able to scan your face from various angles \u2013 so you don\u2019t have to bring the phone up to your face to unlock the phone.\n\nThe Pixel 4\u2019s Soli sensors will also be used for motion gestures, Google previously said. For now, Google has only revealed that you\u2019ll be able to skip songs, snooze alarms, and silence phone calls by waving your hand in front of the phone.\n\nThe bottom bezel is narrower, but the bezels don\u2019t compare overall to recent phones like the OnePlus 7 Pro or Galaxy S10 and Note 10 phones.\n\nThe video leak also shows the sides of the supposed Pixel 4. If the video leak is accurate, it can be surmised that Google may not have prioritized a slim design.\n\nWe\u2019re also shown the back of the device, which appears to be an all-glass design. That\u2019s a departure from Google\u2019s previous and current Pixel designs, where the backs are a combination of metal and glass.\n\nWe get a glimpse of the Pixel 4\u2019s camera system in the video, which seems identical to the teaser photos that Google tweeted in June.\n\nsource Google\n\nAs expected, the video leak suggests that Google won\u2019t be adding back a headphone jack to the Pixel 4. The company removed the headphone jack starting with the Pixel 2 that was released in 2017.\n\nAs legitimate and accurate as the video leak seems, it\u2019s still a leak and doesn\u2019t guarantee that what we\u2019re seeing here is, indeed, the Pixel 4 XL.\n\nSlashleaks was able to transfer Halo Mobile\u2019s video to YouTube, which you can see below:\n\nGoogle is expected to announce the Pixel 4 in October, when the company typically announces new Pixel smartphones. Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to Business Insider\u2019s request for confirmation or clarification about the video.", "description": "Business Insider - Google already teased a bunch of Pixel 4 details, but this video supposedly shows the phone's design in full from all angles..
