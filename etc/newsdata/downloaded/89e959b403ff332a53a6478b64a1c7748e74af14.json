She and her neurosurgeons at Methodist Dallas Medical Center decided to live stream the surgery, for which Jenna was awake to monitor her brain's language centers\n\nAs well over 1,000 people watched from their smartphones and computers around the world, the camera zoomed slowly in on Jenna's face, the only part of her not concealed by blue surgical draping.\n\nUnlike most patients undergoing major surgery, Jenna was not intubated with a machine breathing for her.\n\nA single green tube ran beneath her nose, helping to ensure she was getting enough oxygen.\n\nBehind the surgical draping, hidden from view of the camera, was Jenna's exposed brain, a piece of her skull removed to give two neurosurgeons access to the organ.\n\nA few minutes after the cameras started rolling, Jenna's unencumbered lips twitched upward toward a smile, her eyelashes fluttered and she cast a dreamy glance around her.\n\n'Oh, she's awake!' someone in the operating room exclaimed.\n\nJenna's eyes closed again for a bit, the rest of her stock still thanks to a large halo-like clamp holding her head in place.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again, moments later, Jenna looked utterly nonplussed by the sterile environment or the singular experience of lying awake while surgical instruments probed her brain.\n\nFor the hour and a half before the anesthesiologist slowly brought Jenna back to consciousness, the surgical team worked carefully to cut away the necessary piece of skull, thoroughly numbing her skull and the three layers of protective tissue - called the meninges - surrounding her brain.\n\nWhile working with stroke patients as part of her master's program in occupational therapy, Jenna developed some of the same symptoms as her patients - but she wasn't having a stroke, but a seizure caused by the tangle of blood vessels in her brain\n\nA brain scan revealed the tangle of blood vessels, called a cavernoma, in the left hemisphere of Jenna's brain, near the brain's language center (lit on right hand side of image)\n\nAs chief of neurosurgery at Methodist Dallas Medical Center, Dr Nimesh Patel, explained during Jenna's procedure, the brain itself has very few pain receptors, so it's quite impervious to the sensation, even when being poked by metal tools.\n\nIn other words, Jenna wasn't feeling much discomfort besides being held up rigidly on her side by the head clamp and some mild dry mouth, a common side effect of anesthesia.\n\nShe smiled as the neural monitor, a man named John, bent to position himself within her view.\n\nJenna's cavernoma was located in the left hemisphere of her brain, where speech is formulated and processed for 95 percent of us.\n\nAn estimated one in 100 to 200 people are thought to have cavernomas, but about a quarter of those never have any symptoms.\n\nThese vascular malformations are fairly rare in the general population, but common compared to other malformations.\n\nAhead of the operation, 25-year-Jenna was calm and collected, hoping someone could learn from her experience. Pictured: on a trip to the UK\n\nThere's no clear cause; blood vessels just grow into a tangle instead of feeding to and from various regions as they ought to.\n\nAs the formation grows, it can pres on parts of the brain, disrupting the functions, leading to vision loss, double vision, confusion, nausea, headaches, trouble sleeping, problems with balance and more.\n\nThe primary risk that comes with a cavernoma is that one or more of the vessels in the tangle will burst, bleeding out into the brain - or hemorrhaging - and causing neurological damage.\n\nThe size and location of a cavernoma determines the risks associated with surgically removing it.\n\nAnd what measures, like keeping the patient awake, as was Jenna's case, are necessary to ensure the safe removal of the malformation.\n\nIf the surgeons tested part of the intended surgical route around the cavernoma and found that it disrupted Jenna's speech, it might have been worth it to risk leaving some of the vascular formation in place, rather than damage an intact part of her language brain.\n\n'What she'll be saying and where [the surgeons are testing her brain] indicates where to go and, more importantly, where not to go,' explained Dr Patel.\n\nDuring brain surgeries like Jenna's doctors use a digital guiding systems to reach the malformation using scans (pictured), but Jenna's was more delicate than most because of its proximity to her brain's language center\n\nOnce surgeons began removing the cavernoma, a neural monitor carried on conversation with Jenna to distract her from the work being done to her open brain - including about her beloved puppy, Paisley (pictured)\n\n'A millimeter to the left or to the right can affect her speech, so if she's unable to speak [when the stimulate a part of her brain], we know it's a region that we want to avoid.'\n\nOnce it was clear she was comfortable and ready, John instructed Jenna to look at an iPad and name the images she saw there.\n\nEach image cue was preceded by a futuristic 'pew!' sound, an indicator that the surgeons were stimulating a new section of her brain.\n\n'butterfly...turtle...banana...orange...man...four...shoe,' Jenna says, after each 'pew!'\n\n'We're really waiting for her to miss something, that's an indication that that's a no-go zone,' explained Dr Patel.\n\nJenna continues without a hitch for some time, before finally she pauses a little longer than usual and stumbles on a word.\n\nA no-go zone. The surgeons mark it as such.\n\nA few hours after surgery, Jenan was awake, recovering well and giving a grinning thumbs up to the camera. She'll be monitored closely but is expected to make a full recovery\n\nAfter a few more minutes of Jenna perfectly naming her cues, the surgeons are satisfied with the route they've mapped out. They announce they're ready to begin the removal.\n\n'Oh, awesome,' Jenna exclaims, just audible over the machines and surgical tools.\n\nThe doctors decide they'll leave Jenna awake for the first stages of the cavernoma removal.\n\nAgain, the brave master's student was unfazed.\n\nThe neural monitor crouched down in front of her again and started chatting with Jenna.\n\nThe two carried on a remarkably casual conversation as Jenna eloquently talked about her 'baby' - a puppy named Paisley, about her hopes to walk for graduation from her master's program and more.\n\nAt last the doctors reached the cavernoma, increased the anesthesia, had Jenna count to 20 and stopped the cameras to finish the surgery.\n\n'I feel pretty calm, I have peace about the situation...if this can be some kind of learning opportunity for somebody else...I feel peace about it,' Jenna said before the surgery.\n\nA few hours after surgery, Jenna was awake, smiling and giving the camera a thumbs up.\n\nShe'll have to be monitored for some time, to make sure that the whole cavernoma was removed and that the path to the malformation was as clear as it looked during surgery, but if all goes according to plan, Jenna will make a full recovery and be able to finish her master's degree in occupational therapy next year.", "description": "Jenna Schardt, 25, was diagnosed with a cavernoma, a malformation of blood vessels in her brain that gave her seizures.
