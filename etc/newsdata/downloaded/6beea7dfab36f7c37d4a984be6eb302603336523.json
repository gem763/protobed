Most Members of Congress believe it would be wrong to abandon the Kurds who have been strong allies against Isis.\u201d\n\nThe tough stance from Republican senators contrasts with their usual unwillingness to call out Trump administration policies. Not one of them has backed the impeachment inquiry to date.", "description": "Leading Republican and Democrat senators have launched a joint push to impose hard-hitting sanctions on Turkey over its military offensive in Syria, despite Donald Trump\u2019s limited condemnation.", "authors": ["Ben Riley-Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9YA7QHJWJ2NBeC6zLOnxBQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/7b7efbed188a9dd4d51c62f8bec21a79", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
