Getting your finances in shape also requires a solid strategy and ongoing commitment.\n\nTo add some muscle to your wallet, consider these six financial exercises.\n\nTalk to your future self.\n\nChris Smith, the creator of the financial-advice website I Am Net Worthy, says achieving financial independence starts with a well-thought-out plan to achieve specific goals at a certain age, be it 45 or 85. Then, if you're debating whether to pull money out of your 401k to buy a Porsche, you can seek advice from your \"future self.\" Writing a letter is definitely an option, but research shows that it's even more effective to involve visuals. So, as silly as it may seem you could consider using an aging filter on an app to see your older self and \"talk\" through financial decisions. Research shows it helps make better financial decisions and save more.\n\nMonitor your spending \"streams.\"\n\nMany people focus their research and attention on large, one-time expenses such as a new refrigerator or computer, what Smith calls the \"pops.\" But you could be spending just as much, or more, money in the long run on ongoing expenses \u2014 the \"streams\" \u2014 that aren't given as much thought.\n\n\"Financial beginners fear the pops most, but streams are sneaky dangerous,\" he says. \"The best budgeters have very few streams and watch them like a hawk.\" Buying a $5 latte every workday adds up to about $1,000 a year. It should be given as much consideration as purchasing a $1,000 laptop.\n\nMaximize credit-card rewards.\n\nCredit card bonuses and rewards are better than ever. With Discover's Cashback Match, Discover will automatically match all the cash back that cardmembers earn in their first year. That means for every dollar you earn in cashback throughout the year, Discover will match it dollar for dollar and there is no limit to how much you can earn.

Asking financially-savvy friends about how they bought a house or saved for retirement can provide eye-opening insights. If you're in a relationship, being clear about financial beliefs and goals with your partner can increase happiness and keep your plan on track. Some people even have \"financial-accountability buddies\" who discuss their finances on a scheduled basis. If you uncomfortable asking a friend or family member to be your money buddy, you can find someone through web sites like accountabilitypartners.co.\n\nKnow when it's smart to spend more.\n\nFinding a deal is great, but paying less isn't always the right choice. Certain items, like mattresses, consumer electronics, major appliances, and cars are worth the extra spend. For example, a good mattress can last you up to 10 years, but if you buy a lower-cost one chances are the quality won't be as good. So in the end you'll have to buy two mattresses in the time that a better one would last, costing you more money in the long run.\n\nSimilarly, many people buy used cars to avoid the rapid depreciation that starts when a new vehicle drives off the lot. But Smith says that many people buy used cars and then resell it again a few years later for a drastically lower price. A more expensive car will likely have a higher resell price that earns you more than the initial difference in price, So you should focus on minimizing the net price \u2014 the initial purchase price minus anticipated resale price.\n\nDon't forget about your physical health.\n\nStaying in good health can help your finances in surprising ways. Eating well and exercising can reduce long-term medical costs and health-insurance premiums. It can also boost your productivity so that you have the possibility of earning more. It can even make you take better care of your money. A recent surveysuggested that people in poor financial health tend to avoid thinking or talking about the situation because \"it drains them mentally.\" Meditation, workouts, and other de-stressors fortify you to tackle money matters, so your body, mind, and wallet all stay in tip-top shape.\n\nAs with any fitness regimen, getting your finances in stronger shape takes work. But the result is a more secure and happy financial future.\n\nClick here to learn more about Cash Back Match and Discover.\n\nThis post was created by Insider Studios with Discover.", "description": "If you're looking to improve your financial health, you should give them the same attention as any other \"exercise\" regimen.", "authors": ["Sponsor Post", "Created Insider Studios With Discover"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8bbd1a2e22af3fe6134b2c-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
