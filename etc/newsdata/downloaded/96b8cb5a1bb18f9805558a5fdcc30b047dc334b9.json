They say they therefore could not afford bus fares to campus.\n\nA student, who did not want to be named, said: \"We burnt tyres yesterday\u2026 and when we arrived today the gates were locked\u2026 We were greeted by masked guards whose faces were covered with handkerchiefs, who barred us.\"\n\nSRC secretary general Babalwa Blou said the 80% attendance policy applied to all eight campuses.\n\nAfter a meeting with the college management, Blou said it was resolved that students affected by the 80% policy should write letters stating why they deserved amnesty. Students also protested in Makhanda. While the students here also expressed concern over the 80% attendance issue, the main focus of their protest was different.\n\nSRC president Sabelo Madlala said students were concerned by the \"continuous issue\" of the college failing to facilitate practicals, which has been happening since 2017.\n\nSabelo said that, according to the National Certificate Vocational syllabus, students were supposed to do \"theory and practicals\", which was not happening.\n\nAshley Kasnel, a level four tourism student, said the protests were sparked when the college cancelled a practical trip to Cape Town.\n\nHe said that the class was due to travel to Cape Town on August 25, but the head of the campus had not signed off on the trip.\n\nQuestions sent to NSFAS have not been answered.\n\nCollege spokesperson Kate Oladimeji said that the 80% class attendance policy was an instruction from the Department of Higher Education and Training, and that it had been communicated to the SRC.\n\nOn the issue of the practical in Cape Town, she said students were encouraged to attend practicals in the region, for example Plettenberg Bay, Port Elizabeth and East London.\n\nShe said the college was complying with curriculum requirements.\n\nOladimeji said classes would resume on campus on Thursday.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
