Even unproven allegations have led to mob lynchings and murder.\n\nProsecutor Munam Bashir Chaudhry told AFP the case is the first to be tried under a section of the cybercrime laws, which were passed in 2016, pertaining to hate speech.\n\nThere have been other cases of prosecution against \u201conline blasphemy\u201d in Pakistan, including one in 2017 that saw a man sentenced to death for sharing what the court said was blasphemous content on social media.\n\nHowever none of the previous convictions have come under the cybercrime laws, according to Chaudhry.\n\nPakistani authorities say they have registered about 500 cases in total under the cybercrime laws since they came into effect.\n\nCritics of the laws say they are open to abuse by government agencies to restrict freedom of expression in a country where activists have long warned of a shrinking space for dissent.\n\nIn 2017 the Islamabad High Court ordered the government to open an investigation into \u201conline blasphemy\u201d, threatening to ban social media platforms that failed to censor content insulting Islam and its values.\n\nPakistan famously blocked Facebook for two weeks in 2010 over blasphemous content.\n\nIt also blocked Youtube from 2012 to 2016 due to a film about Islam\u2019s Prophet that led to violent protests across the Muslim world.", "description": "Lahore (Pakistan) (AFP) \u2013 A Pakistani court Friday sentenced a man to five years \u201crigorous imprisonment\u201d \u2014 jail and hard", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/79aebf_blasphemy-is-hugely-sensitive-in-conservative-muslim-pakistan-pakistani-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
