He went 6-1 with a 2.65 ERA over his last 10 starts \u2014 a dominating run that carried right into the post-season.\n\nThe best-of-five series now shifts to St. Louis, where Calgary's Mike Soroka gets the ball for the Braves in Game 3 on Sunday against Adam Wainwright.\n\nGoing against St. Louis ace Jack Flaherty, who had one of the great second halves in baseball history, Foltynewicz allowed only three hits, didn't walk anyone and struck out seven during an 83-pitch outing that kept the Cardinals from mounting any semblance of offence. They only got one runner as far as second base against him \u2014 and that was in the second when Yadier Molina singled and Braves second baseman Ozzie Albies extended the inning by misplaying Paul DeJong's grounder for an error.\n\nNo problem for Foltynewicz. He fanned Harrison Bader to end the threat.\n\nAfter Kolten Wong hit into a double play to end the seventh, Duvall emerged from the dugout to hit for Foltynewicz in the bottom half. With a runner aboard and two outs, Duvall was greeted by a smattering of boos from the SunTrust Park crowd that clearly wanted Foltynewicz to go at least one more inning \u2014 especially after the Braves bullpen imploded the night before in a Game 1 loss.\n\nFrom dud to stud\n\nThe heckles turned to cheers when Duvall drove a 3-2 pitch from Flaherty into the centre-field seats, giving the Braves a bit of breathing room. Duvall spent nearly the entire season at Triple-A, where he set a franchise record with 32 homers, so it wouldn't be a stretch to say this as much a victory for the Gwinnett Stripers as the Braves.\n\nMax Fried, normally a starter and pitching on back-to-back days for the first time all season, breezed through the eighth before turning it over to Mark Melancon, who gave up four runs in the ninth inning of the series opener, sending the Braves to a 7-6 loss.\n\nIt was another shaky outing for Melancon, who gave up a pair of one-out singles before striking out Molina and Wong to earn the save.\n\nFoltynewicz celebrates the Braves' Game 2 victory.

The 23-year-old right-hander went 7-2 with an 0.91 ERA in 15 starts after the All-Star break, the third-lowest ERA over the second half in baseball history, surpassed only by Jake Arrieta (0.75) for the 2015 Chicago Cubs and Greg Maddux (0.87) for the 1994 Braves.\n\nFlaherty was the NL pitcher of the month for both August and September.\n\nFoltynewicz has the edge for October honours, having pulled off his own tale of two seasons. An All-Star in 2018 who started two games for the Braves in last year's playoffs, he was demoted to the minors in late June with a record of 2-5 and a 6.37 ERA.\n\nNow, in a game the Braves absolutely had to have, he turned in his best performance of all.\n\nThe only time he was really threatened was in the fourth, when Wong hit one to warning track in right with a man aboard for the third out.", "description": "Mike Foltynewicz threw seven crisp innings before pinch-hitter Adam Duvall hit a two-run homer that carried the Atlanta Braves to a 3-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Friday, evening the NL Division Series at one game apiece.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5310170.1570231132!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/duvall-adam-100419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
