Here's why | Melanie Tait", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019ve taken to switching my phone\u2019s ringer on between 8.30pm and 10.30pm on a week night. It feels like a dangerous act, for someone who used to be part of the \u201cno phone calls allowed\u201d brigade.\n\nThere are lots of things to panic about with a phone call, chief among them being: what if we run out of things to say, and there\u2019s, God forbid, silence?\n\nThere\u2019s no curation of the witty comeback. There\u2019s no inserting the perfect emoji. It\u2019s two human beings, inside each other\u2019s ear, trying to figure each other out and connect.\n\nWhat monster would call me from a landline? We need to ban phone calls | Brigid Delaney's diary Read more\n\nOver the past few months, I\u2019ve become a phone call evangelist, because I\u2019ve discovered a small group of my friends (men and women in their mid-30s to early 40s) love to talk on the phone. Like, for hours. And, damn, it feels really, really good.\n\nOne of these friends usually calls me at around 10pm. He\u2019s told me that he worries it\u2019s uncivil to do so, but he\u2019ll have noticed I\u2019ve posted something on the socials, so deduces I must be awake. I know what\u2019s coming: anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours of conversation that traverses everything from pop culture, politics, our days at work, our mutual friends, to whose nanna was the most magical.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s the best part of my day.\n\nWe\u2019ll spend a lot of these conversations trying to make each other laugh, but I\u2019ve also noticed we\u2019re both able to share a little more in this telephonic friendship than we do in real life (our real-life friendship also being a very robust one). The lack of eye contact means some questions are easier to ask and some things are easier to reveal.\n\nIt\u2019s like being transported back to high school in the 90s, where you\u2019d be at school all day, and at night, extension chord dragged into the pantry while the rest of the house slept. Phone D&Ms (\u201cdeep and meaningfuls\u201d) were one of the great emotional releases in pre-mobile teen life, a chance to talk away the existential drama of the school day.\n\nA phone call can be viewed an aggressive personal intrusion\n\nWhen it\u2019s finally time to wind things up on one of these nocturnal phone communions, I\u2019m usually snuggled into bed already. The covers are pulled up and I\u2019m off to sleep with a goofy smile on my face.\n\nWhy these goofy, smiley feelings? These conversations aren\u2019t romantic. They\u2019re taking place inside an already strong platonic friendship of some years that\u2019s made its way to the phone.\n\nWhy do these feelings come with a phone call, yet not with a night of texting or messaging backwards and forwards?\n\nIt might be because in our culture of busy-ness, someone taking time out to phone you and have a non-necessary phone conversation means they\u2019re effectively saying \u201cI have time for you. You matter to me.\u201d\n\nDr Lila Landowski, a neuroscientist at the University of Tasmania, says it\u2019s all about the endorphins:\n\n\u201cWhen we talk to people we care about \u2013 whether in person or over the phone \u2013 we know that our brain releases oxytocin. Oxytocin is responsible for that feeling of being close and connected to someone. And it doesn\u2019t just make us bond with people, it also makes us feel better, by reducing the levels of stress hormones, like cortisol, in our body.\u201d\n\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\nShe says text messages and emails just don\u2019t do the same thing: \u201cText messaging activates the brain\u2019s reward pathway, but it doesn\u2019t seem to result in the release of oxytocin.\u201d\n\nCulturally, the smartphone means we\u2019re moving further and further away from phone calls, as countless column inches devoted to the welcomed death of them attest..\n\nA social media call-out to people born after 1988 (none of them were picking up their phone) showed an intense distrust of a phone conversation. Growing up with mobile phones and messaging means a phone call can be viewed an aggressive personal intrusion. A phone call means less time to formulate a response. It means more vulnerability to another person.\n\nJames Findlay (@james_findlay) As someone who has to call people under 30s as a job\n\n(among other things), THEY FKING HATE TALKING ON THE PHONE.\n\nBrandon Cook \ud83c\udf08 (@brandycooklyn) Wait, you want to hear me talk? To hear me stumble and stutter? You want to see me as a person? A human with flaws? Without being able to correct my mistakes before they're seen? Nor image crafting? As though I were not a goddamn brand? A magical creature? A HIGHER BEING\n\nOlympia Kwitowski (@Olympia_CK) My friend runs a PR company. Intern came in and she asked her to do some cold calling to businesses. She left the room went to the bathroom, threw up then left and got her friend who picked her up to o upstairs and collect her bag.\n\nYet it would seem those who avoid the phone call are missing out.\n\nProfessor Barbara Keys from the University of Melbourne, wrote in the Conversation: \u201cThe voice is one of our most powerful instruments, designed not only to communicate but also to build intimacy. Our voices convey emotion so effectively that we can identify emotions in speech even when the words themselves are muffled by walls. The voice indicates whether you are sincere \u2013 or whether you are drunk.\u201d\n\nShe also points to research out of Germany in the 1980s that found that the humble phone call \u201cmade people feel wanted, needed, included and involved.\u201d Keys\u2019 writing about the social and political implications of fewer phone calls is also worth seeking out.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the case for new mother Lucille Cutting, 30.\n\nSo Generation Mute doesn\u2019t like phone calls. Good. Who wants to talk, anyway? | Andy Dawson Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve reverted back to doing them [making phone calls] now that I\u2019m on maternity leave. They\u2019re great for when I go for long walks with the pram and actually have head space for a conversation. It\u2019s like a dose of endorphins, regardless of whether it\u2019s a happy or slightly sad chat.\u201d\n\nGretchen Miller, 51, is a radio-maker who spends a lot of time thinking about sound and communication, and is a fan of the phone D&M.\n\n\u201cI still hear the \u2018phone voice\u2019 as intimate. It signifies intimacy for me \u2013 the receiver pressed to the ear, the thin sound of the voice and the depth of the stories ... that all means closeness.\u201d\n\nFor me, I no longer see a night at home as a gaping chasm of time to be filled with a TV show I\u2019m only half-interested in, sucking on a few pieces of chocolate and getting lost down internet rabbit holes.\n\nTonight, headphones in, a phone call or two means I\u2019ll discover something new about someone I care about, laugh at least three times, reveal something I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else and maybe even discover a new Liza Minnelli impersonator I\u2019d never heard of.\n\nAnd how bloody cup-filling is that?\n\n\u2022 Melanie Tait is a Hobart-based journalist, author and playwright", "description": "Culturally, we\u2019re moving away from phone conversations \u2013 but they\u2019re often the best part of my day", "authors": ["Melanie Tait"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943c718f65cc63a27616d476963be1db4df65e59/0_57_7360_4416/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=98ae2a31ddfc327d25b73a24caa61fc3", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
