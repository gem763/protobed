REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nThe data offered the first clue on how a sales tax hike that kicked off in October could affect price growth, which remains subdued despite years of heavy money printing by the BOJ.\n\nThe rise in the core consumer price index (CPI) in the Japanese capital, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, was slower than a median market estimate for a 0.7 percent gain and flat from the pace of increase in September.\n\n\u201cCompanies aren\u2019t translating the tax hike impact onto consumers as much as expected,\u201d said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.\n\n\u201cThe BOJ is likely to trim its inflation forecast at its quarterly report for October,\u201d she said, adding that the nationwide core CPI is likely to hit 0.5% in October.\n\nJapan\u2019s government proceeded with a twice-delayed increase in the sales tax rate to 10% from 8% in October as part of efforts to rein in the country\u2019s huge public debt.\n\nTo ease the burden from the higher levy, the government started to offer discounts or make childcare services free of charge from October.\n\nWhen excluding the impact of the tax hike and the childcare discount, core consumer inflation in Tokyo hit 0.34% in October to mark the slowest pace in more than two years, according to the government\u2019s estimate.\n\nYears of ultra-loose policy has failed to fire up inflation to the BOJ\u2019s 2% target, forcing the central bank to maintain its massive stimulus program despite the strain on financial institutions\u2019 profits from near-zero interest rates.\n\nIn forecasts made in July, the BOJ was counting on nationwide core consumer inflation hitting 1.0% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2020, including the effect of the higher tax.\n\nThe central bank is likely to trim the inflation forecast at the October quarterly report, which will be issued after a rate review on Thursday, sources have told Reuters.\n\nBut it is leaning toward keeping policy steady as stable markets, a truce in U.S.-China trade talks and robust domestic demand give it room to save its dwindling ammunition to fight the next recession, they said.", "description": "Core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide inflation, rose 0.5% in October from a year earlier, data showed on Tuesday, staying distant from the Bank of Japan's elusive 2% target and keeping it under pressure to ramp up stimulus.", "authors": ["Yoshiyasu Shida", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446008682&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S003", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
