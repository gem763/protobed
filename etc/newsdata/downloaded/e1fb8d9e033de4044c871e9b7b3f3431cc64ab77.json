She also gained confidence in herself, people who cared for her and the idea that life could get better. \u201cThey\u2019re some of the most caring people I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d she said of the counselors. \u201cWhether you come in high or not, they always treat you with respect.\u201d Now, she said, \u201cI work to make them proud of me.\u201d\n\nJennings remains a work in progress. She says she still sometimes uses cocaine, but less over time, and she adds that she\u2019s no longer stealing. If she had been held in jail , she said, \u201cit would have pissed me off, and I would have gotten high when I got out. I\u2019d still be homeless, stealing for food and drug money.\u201d\n\nPrison, she says, just makes people more miserable and more dependent on drugs when they are released. \u201cThis bit about \u2018I learned my lesson\u2019 \u2014 no, it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are hurting inside. That\u2019s why they\u2019re using in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe war on drugs began in 1971 out of a legitimate alarm about narcotics both in the United States and among U.S. troops in Vietnam. But the \u201cwar\u201d approach locked up enormous numbers of people and devastated the family structure . Drug laws discriminated against African-Americans (possession of crack cocaine, disproportionately used by blacks, drew far harsher sentences than possession of the same quantity of powdered cocaine, more likely to be used by whites).\n\nYet locking up endless waves of users has had little deterrent effect, and overdose deaths have surged. The White House has estimated that the economic cost of the opioid crisis in the United States exceeds $500 billion a year, equivalent to about $4,000 per household. And that doesn\u2019t even include cocaine, meth and other drug use.\n\nWhile the U.S. doubled down on the criminal justice approach to drugs, Portugal took the opposite avenue, decriminalizing possession of all drugs in 2001. It was a gamble, but it succeeded. As I\u2019ve reported, Portugal\u2019s overdose deaths plunged. The upshot is that drug mortality rates in the United States are now about 50 times higher than in Portugal.", "description": "While other cities are jailing drug users, Seattle has found another way.", "authors": ["Nicholas Kristof"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/25/opinion/sunday/25Kristof15/25Kristof15-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
