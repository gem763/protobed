This time it\u2019s \u201cLet It Be Love,\u201d a worthy successor to the MTV smash \u201cHonestly\u201d and 1990\u2019s \u201cLady.\u201d\n\nSweet also brings in a truckload of metal friends, including cameos from members of Whitesnake, L.A. Guns, Fozzy and Arch Enemy. \u201cSon of Man,\u201d a duet with Todd La Torre of Queensryche, is everything a heavy metal song should be: fast-paced, drum-heavy and with unfathomably shredding guitar by Andy James. It sounds like what might be expected if Sweet sang with Motorhead while Yngwie Malmsteen played guitar.\n\nIt all adds up: \u201cTen\u201d is easily one of the best hard rock albums of 2019.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Michael Sweet, \"Ten\" (Rat Pak)", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Wayne Parry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/music_review_-_michael_sweet_89366_c0-137-656-519_s1770x1032.jpg?1a9393bfe6c7bb5447b0d464bc356102a7863ad0", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
