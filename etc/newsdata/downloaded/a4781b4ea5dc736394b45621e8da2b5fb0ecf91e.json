Crenshaw duel over background checks: 'Why are you \"lending\" guns to people unsupervised?'", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Wednesday called out a Republican congressman who complained that implementing stricter gun laws would prevent him from letting friends borrow his handgun.\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, shared on Twitter a local news report about a woman who police say shot and wounded a suspected robber who reached for her purse.\n\n\u201cSituations like this story are why we protect the 2nd Amendment,\u201d Crenshaw tweeted, adding: \u201cSide note: With universal background checks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to let my friends borrow my handgun when they travel alone like this. We would make felons out of people just for defending themselves.\u201d\n\nTexas law allows private gun owners to sell or lend a handgun to anyone who is over the age of 18 and not a felon. The state does not require background checks for private sales of firearms.\n\n\u201cYou are a member of Congress,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet. \u201cWhy are you \u2018lending\u2019 guns to people unsupervised who can\u2019t pass a basic background check?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people you\u2019re giving a gun to have likely abused their spouse or have a violent criminal record, [and] you may not know it,\u201d she added. \u201cWhy on earth would you do that?\u201d\n\nReps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas.

That they can\u2019t pass a background check? Wrong. People lend guns to friends, esp if they don\u2019t own a gun, for self-defense and hunting purposes. This is America outside NYC.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said w/ universal background checks, you wouldn\u2019t be able to \u2018lend\u2019 guns to friends,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote back. \u201cIf a background check would be a problem, then you shouldn\u2019t \u2018lend\u2019 a gun. And btw, NY is one of the safest states in the country when it comes to guns, [including] rural areas. Try to keep up.\u201d\n\nTheir Twitter spat comes amid a push by Democrats and some Republicans to reform U.S. gun laws in the wake of a string of deadly mass shootings, including two in Crenshaw\u2019s home state.\n\nOn Saturday, seven people were killed and more than 20 others wounded in a shooting rampage near Odessa, Texas. On Tuesday, NBC News reported the gunman purchased his weapon from a private seller \u2014 a transaction that does not require a background check.\n\n\u201cThe shooter tried to buy a gun from a registered dealer, but failed the background check,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., noted in a tweet. \u201cSo he bought the gun in a private sale, no background check required. Then he shot 30 people, killing 7. Could there be a more compelling case for why we need universal background checks?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the 1st mass shooting where a universal background check *possibly* would have prevented him from having a gun, if and only if, they decided to self-enforce that law,\u201d Crenshaw replied. \u201cGuys who shoot cops tend not to self-enforce laws. And we don\u2019t make sweeping policy on one situation.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Rep.
