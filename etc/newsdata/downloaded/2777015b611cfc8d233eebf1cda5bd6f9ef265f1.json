Murena o ri tonda! (God loves us, God has blessed us),\" she raps in Tshivenda by way of greeting. Rendani Tshamiswe doesn\u2019t need a beat to start rapping \u2013 she\u2019s always ready to \u201cspit a bar or two\u201d at any given time. She\u2019s a freestyler, just like rappers at a cipher (battle).\n\nBut instead of a rap crew, she has a congregation who hang on to her every word at her church in a village outside Vuwani in Venda. Rendani\u2019s following grew after a video of her rapping in her mother tongue went viral. And now the popular pastor plans to make a CD of holy hits.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been doing radio interviews and as a result receiving calls requesting my CD but I don\u2019t have one,\" she says.\n\n\"Now things are getting serious.\"\n\nShe\u2019s shocked by all the attention. \u201cI was just doing what I do best at a graduation ceremony where I was preaching in Vuwani, Venda.\u201d She didn\u2019t know someone was recording her.\n\n\"The video was recorded in 2018 so when it surfaced now, I was really surprised that people loved it so much.\"\n\nBut Rendani believes there\u2019s a bigger reason behind her sudden fame. \"God is never late. He\u2019s always on time.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old mother to Tondani (23), Maanda (17) and Orifuna (9) started rapping a few years ago to spread the word to young people.\n\n\"It\u2019s a myth that people should love church and God only when they are old.\" She\u2019s seen many youths living their lives aimlessly. They wake up to spend the day on the street corner, asking passers-by for R2 or a smoke. And when Sundays rolls around they\u2019re either hungover or making plans to get drunk. They\u2019re not thinking about church or God.\n\n\"Young people are out there drinking and wasting their lives, being tempted by bad things of the world,\" she says.\n\nShe grew up in church. Rendani sang in a community choir called Servants of God, founded by her mother, between 1995 and 1998 in Ha-Mutsha, Limpopo. From 1998 to 2007 she was part of the Worship Ya Elshadai and later sang at Synagogue Worship church from 2008 to 2011.\n\nWhen she and her husband, Alfred, established their spiritual home Vision of Glory back in 2013, she wanted to fill the pews with young people. Rendani decided to make church a little more exciting to attract the younger generation by introducing hip hop style rap sessions to her sermons.\n\n\"They love it and pay attention to what I preach about. I don\u2019t even write my lyrics down. Because I love God so much, I easily get into it.\"\n\nSEE A VIDEO OF THE PASTOR HERE:\n\nHer teenage son, Maanda, was a great influence in Rendani\u2019s quest to modernise her sermons.\n\n\"He plays the keyboard and bass guitar in church. So, one day he was playing the keyboard at home, and I started rapping. \u201cHe then went on to download a beat on the internet and I just flowed and started rapping,\" she shares.\n\nIt was so good they decided to take the \"cool discovery\" to church, where her new skill became a hit. Maanda is proud of his mom\u2019s new popularity. He comes back from school just before 16:30 on the day we pop in at the family\u2019s home for our interview, quickly changing out of his school uniform so he can get ready to go to a mid-week prayer service with his mom, who he calls his bestie. It\u2019s clear the teen adores his mother.\n\n\"I am so happy to have an opportunity to create music with my mother, especially something that appeals to the youth. \u201cMy friends have given her the thumbs up and that\u2019s so nice because it gives me some popularity,\" he laughs.\n\nShe and her husband established Vision of Glory in 2013 after years of dodging \"God\u2019s calling\". \"So many things were going wrong in our lives. I told Alfred we had suffered enough so he needs to trust where God was leading him and that I would be there to support him,\" Rendani says.\n\nStarting the church put the couple on a new path and brought them closer. It also strengthened her faith.\n\n\"I walked with Him and as a result the gift of prophecy started manifesting in my life as I became closer and closer to God. \u201cThings were revealed to me in my dreams or when I preached and worshipped. Even now, He has given me His blessing and says whatever I want to do He will support me all the way.\"\n\nRendani feels like her life\u2019s purpose is starting to unfold beautifully \u2013 particularly now that she can spread the gospel on a bigger platform, even though it\u2019s in a rather unusual way.\n\n\"God can use anyone, like me . I dropped out of school when I was in Grade 11 but in the eyes of God, I am important because I have devoted my life to bringing people closer to Him,\" she says.\n\nDropping out of school was one of the worst decisions she ever made, but Rendani was blinded by love. \"I was in love, when my husband told me he loved me. I was so in love that I became a housewife and helped him grow the spaza shop he had at the time.\"\n\nHowever, she doesn\u2019t for a minute regret standing by her husband. The couple have been married for 23 years, something she says is a blessing from the Almighty.\n\n\"I\u2019m not educated, the only thing I have is a baptismal certificate, a marriage certificate and pastor \u2019s certificate. When I preach I always tell people that they should not give up on themselves and their lives. \u201cAt the end of the day, no matter what situation you face, you are loved by God.\"", "description": "This Venda pastor\u2019s talent for rap has done just what she\u2019d hoped it would do \u2013 it\u2019s brought young people to church.", "authors": ["Bonolo Sekudu"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/895b0b3a03ea4e8689613cbfd59b3cee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
