Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nSomething you might have noticed about the upcoming movie Joker is that it exists in a universe where the lead character, Batman\u2019s most famous nemesis, is called \u201cJoker.\u201d My colleague Nate Jones posed this important question two weeks ago: When did everybody start calling him \u201cJoker\u201d instead of \u201cthe Joker\u201d? Jack Nicholson\u2019s famous line was \u201cYou can call me Joker,\u201d but Christopher Nolan referred to his character as \u201cthe Joker\u201d in interviews. Now, in Todd Phillips\u2019s iteration, it\u2019s crystal clear: Arthur Fleck is just Joker, baby \u2014 adding an article is for sissies.\n\nJoker is a movie about jokes and loneliness and jokes about loneliness, but it\u2019s also about the absence of a certain \u201cthe.\u201d So Vulture has put together a handy photo-essay guide to the name of the movie\u2019s main character. Call him by his name \u2014 Joker \u2014 and hope he doesn\u2019t call you anything at all.\n\nIn the beauty industry, this is what they call a beat. Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nMight I present a lightly edited Drake lyric: \u201cPlease do not speak to me like I\u2019m that Joker from four eleven years ago I\u2019m at a higher substantially lower place.\u201d\n\nTell Men\u2019s Wearhouse I\u2019m coming in, and I don\u2019t have a credit limit! Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nJust to reiterate: Joker? That\u2019s his name, don\u2019t wear it out! Other things that should not be worn out include: this tie.\n\nJust wait till a White House reporter posts this with the caption \u201cHe\u2019s running.\u201d Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nWhat\u2019s he running from? Oh. A definite article, like one used to denote a proper noun. Perhaps the definite article \u201cthe.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen you fuckers, you screwheads\u2026\u201d Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nThis looks like Robert De Niro in a little movie called Taxi Driver, but I promise you it\u2019s actually Joaquin Phoenix in a little movie called Joker. Again, that movie was called Taxi Driver, not The Taxi Driver, so this movie is called Joker, not The Joker. You see what they\u2019re getting at here?\n\nWhy so serious? \u2026 Wait, wrong Joker. Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nINT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. CALIFORNIA. DAY.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not even worth state tuition, Arthur.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Joker.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, actually it\u2019s not, and it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me Joker like you said you would!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should just go to City College. You know, with your work ethic, you should just go to City College and then to jail and then back to City College, and then maybe you\u2019d learn to pull yourself up and not expect everybody to do \u2014 AHHHHH!!!!!!\u201d\n\nTotally kind of hot Marc Maron and King of the Resistance Robert De Niro. Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nThis is the scene where Joker says, \u201cCall me Joker.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say the Joker, just Joker \u2014 that\u2019s how you know that his name is, again, \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\nAt Joker\u2019s TIFF premiere, Todd Phillips said he really loved A Star Is Born, and it\u2019s so funny because I really loved that movie too. Just felt like it was important to share that in a safe space. Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nHey! What? Just wanted to take another look at you, Joker.\n\nDid I make this myself in Preview? Absolutely I did. Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nI pinky promise you, as someone who has seen Joker, that there is a scene where, inexplicably, Justin Timberlake arrives and says: \u201cDrop the the. It\u2019s cleaner.\u201d\n\nAnyway. In conclusion:\n\nThis is literally from the movie. It was not edited by me in Preview, although it sort of looks like it was. Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nThat\u2019s his name, and also the name of the movie.
