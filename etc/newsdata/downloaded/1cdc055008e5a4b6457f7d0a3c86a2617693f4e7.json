The Welsh government would not reveal the details of any support given.\n\nAny public funds pledged to support Mr Ratcliffe\u2019s business interests are likely to raise eyebrows. In February, The Sunday Times reported that Sir Jim and his two key lieutenants, Andrew Currie and John Reece, were planning a move to the tax-free principality of Monaco in a bid to save \u00a34bn in UK taxes.
