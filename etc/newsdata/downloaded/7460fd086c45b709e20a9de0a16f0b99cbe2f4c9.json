Last month we got her Future collaboration 'holy terrain'. This morning, she gave us 'home with you'.\n\nPart piano ballad, part crunching electronic ode to how love crushes each party equally, 'home with you' is like 'cellophane's' spiritual sister. Twigs told i-D music editor Frankie Dunn about the track in her cover story last month: \u201cIt\u2019s about relationships. People are just quite needy, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so fun and beautiful to sing. Those big strings at the end \u2013 it\u2019s like flying with your voice!\u201d\n\nThe song sounds like a conversation between two people. No matter how much they seem to think they know each other, they can\u2019t read each other\u2019s emotions sometimes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you were lonely, if you\u2019d have just told me I\u2019d be home with you,\u201d Twigs sings in striking falsetto for the song\u2019s chorus.\n\nShe also dropped a new video alongside it. It starts in the pit of a night club, and sees twigs dip out, get in a car and drive through the night to reach the countryside, where she experiences a bright white spiritual enlightenment: running through fields and into the forests, in search of her missing half.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Watch it right here!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9b0aff5eaad7000a7d3a22/lede/1570442477620-homewithyou.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
