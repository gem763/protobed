It\u2019s impossible. I have a bit of experience with that, even with incredible supporting you are not able to win it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to try in football to seduce our fans to come here and say: \u2018OK, we can do it.\u2019\n\n\u201cI know for the fans the Premier League here in England is the most exciting. We know as a club, we make polls and people prefer by far to win the Premier League than the Champions League.\n\n\u201cHere in England, I know how special it is, but this competition is nice too. Our fans have to live this competition like a dream.\u201d\n\nGuardiola claimed that City\u2019s lack of history in the Champions League when compared with the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool is also a factor in the hostility of City fans towards the competition.\n\n\u201cWe were at home drinking a beer watching Liverpool and United there. Not for a few years, for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is in the culture of the club.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be there and try and the only way is to say to our fans come to join us, come to the stadium and support us. Make the stadium full. In the bad moments, support us because these guys deserve it for what we have done in especially the last two seasons.\n\n\u201cIncredible players like David Silva \u2013 the quickest player to 200 victories in Premier League history. These players are fantastic, awesome, they are outrageous. They are top. I think they deserve it in this competition every single game.\n\n\u201cThey feel they want to win, want to make a step forward too. [It is] not only desire for the manager, staff, chairman and people working in the club. We need the fans. If not the competition is more difficult, it\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d", "description": "Pep Guardiola has claimed it will be \u201cimpossible\u201d for Manchester City to win the Champions League unless his team can \u201cseduce\u201d supporters into loving the competition.
