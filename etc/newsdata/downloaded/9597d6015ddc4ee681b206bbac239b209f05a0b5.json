One of the most popular things to do here, though, is a trip to the nearby Goyomatsu limestone cave, the highlight of which is the unusual form of transport used to get you there.\n\n\u25bc Tickets can be purchased here, with the entrance fee to the cave costing 450 yen.\n\nUsing the parking lot costs an extra 500 yen, which goes towards the \u201cGround Water Facility Cooperation Fund\u201d, and to get up to the cave, you\u2019ll need to purchase a ticket on the monorail, which costs 400 yen for the fare up and 200 yen for the fare down.\n\n\u25bc And when we say \u201cmonorail\u201d, we mean this:\n\nOur reporter Muromachi was keen to go on this unusual journey, so after buying his tickets at the reception, he went up to the landing and prepared himself for the trip on the trolley train known as the monorail. It\u2019s a rickety trip uphill through a forest, so everybody on board is required to wear helmets for safety.\n\nThe uncovered vehicle looked more like a roller coaster than a monorail, but with no seatbelts on board, this seemed slightly more frightening. Still, there was no turning back now, so Muromachi hopped in and waited for the driver to board and start the motor.\n\nWhen the ride started, Muromachi didn\u2019t look so great at all. The angle of the journey was much steeper than he expected, and with no seat belt, all he could do was hold onto the metal rail in front of him to feel secure.\n\nAs the ride progressed, Muromachi gradually grew more comfortable, and was actually able to enjoy the beautiful forest as the ride rambled by.\n\nAfter about five minutes, they reached the top, and Muromachi was grateful that the weather held out long enough so that he didn\u2019t have to use the umbrella, which was kindly provided for passengers.\n\nStepping off the ride, Muromachi entered the cave, with a local guide leading the way for the group. With numerous stalactites that have grown over thousands of years, or even tens of thousands of years, the cave is like a natural work of art.\n\nThe 200-meter-long cave is illuminated inside, with a number of interesting features that the guide will readily point out to visitors.\n\nAfter the cave tour, it was time to return to the monorail for the journey back down the mountain. As the trolley car can\u2019t be turned around, passengers ride backwards on the way down, which is both terrifying and thrilling at the same time.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made it safely back down the slope, there\u2019s another place you shouldn\u2019t miss out on visiting: Gorogoro Mizu.\n\nGorogoro Mizu is a natural spring set in a forest where residents come to collect free water in gourd-shaped bottles. The water here is so good it\u2019s been selected as one of Japan\u2019s top 100 famous waters.\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 a journey off the beaten path to a cave up a steep slope on a thrilling monorail. This has to be one of the most unique spots to visit in Japan, but if you\u2019re still up for some more adventure, don\u2019t forget to make time for a trip across a river in the self-operated Edo-period cable car nearby.\n\nPark information\n\nGoyomatsu Limestone Cave / \u4e94\u4ee3\u677e\u937e\u4e73\u6d1e\n\nAddress\uff1aNara-ken, Yoshino-gun, Tenkawa, Dorogawa\n\n\u5948\u826f\u770c\u5409\u91ce\u90e1\u5929\u5ddd\u6751\u6d1e\u5ddd\n\nHours: 9:30 a.m.-11:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m.-3:50 p.m.\n\nClosed on Wednesdays and temporarily closed during periods of rain and/or storms, and closed all winter.\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Japan Travel: What it\u2019s like to go on a solo journey on a Japanese restaurant train\n\n-- Japan Travel: Mysterious rockstar Jizo statue found at Kiyomizudera temple\n\n-- Japan travel bucket list: top places to visit in each prefecture before you die\u3010Part I\u3011\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/16/japan-travel-explore-a-hidden-cave-on-a-tiny-monorail-roller-coaster-thrill-ride-in-nara/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Over the years, our Japanese-language reporters have been travelling around the country, exploring hidden gems off the well-worn tourist path that are usually only enjoyed by locals.
