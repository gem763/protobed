Courtesy of Owen Burke/Business Insider\n\nThere are many koozies and can coolers out there, but sometimes there's one built just right for a certain time and place.\n\nI present to you Toadfish's Non-Tipping Can Cooler, the pragmatic drinking accessory we never knew we needed.\n\nOkay, so a can cooler with a suction cup on the bottom isn't the newest idea, but this one by Toadfish is the most durable and functional one I've seen, and I've spilled plenty of beverages trying out other ones in the past. This one sticks to almost anything, and with double-walled vacuum-insulated stainless steel, it also keeps beer or any other 12-ounce canned beverage cool for hours (the brand claims six hours of drinkability, but I'd say more in the shade and less in the sun).\n\nWhatever you want to put inside this thing, know this much: Chances are good that you will spill exactly 100% less of it than you did before you bought this thrifty little contraption.\n\nSpecs\n\nEven underway, this can stayed up on the bow. Courtesy of Owen Burke/Business Insider\n\nDesigned to rest at angles up to 25 degrees for any period of time, Toadfish Outfitters' Non-Tipping Can Cooler is made with double-walled and vacuum-insulated stainless steel. That's run-of-the-mill these days, but it also speaks to the price. You're just not going to find high-grade stainless steel for less.\n\nFieldnotes\n\nAbracadabra. Courtesy of Owen Burke/Business Insider\n\nThere's a boatload of comments out there about not being able to get this thing to stick. Frankly, I found the opposite. This print-through fiberglass in the photo above is my case in point. The thing might not stick to everything, but there was hardly a surface on my (very untidy) skiff that wouldn't hold it.\n\nAs for the inside function of this cooler cup, it works just as well as any. I managed about four hours of direct sunlight before I noticed beverages really starting to come up to temperature, not that you'd pull out a drink and leave it in the sun for all that long. Just know that, as with other brands offering cooler cups in this price range, it'll be a while before you're stuck with warm beer.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you're spending a lot of time on boats \u2014 or even out tailgating with rowdy crowds \u2014 Toadfish's Non-Tipping Can Cooler is probably a sound investment. You could be on a 12-foot canoe, a 20-foot skiff, or a 70-foot yacht, and there will always be a shortage of cupholders in the right place at the right time. I, for one, have no space at all for a cupholder. If I were to install one, I'd break it within a week or two (as a matter of fact, I have installed plastic ones and broken them). This is a solution to a longtime problem of mine, and I'm eternally grateful to Toadfish for it.\n\nAnd what's not to like about the brand having its own sustainability initiative in place for oyster bed restoration? Every purchase of a holder results in 10 square feet of oyster bed replanting, and that's something we can get behind.\n\nPros: Solid suction cup that'll stick to most any smooth surface\n\nCons: Might take a little coaxing with some surfaces, doesn't fit bottles", "description": "Knowing your beer will (almost) never go warm is comforting, but having good faith that it won't tip over?
