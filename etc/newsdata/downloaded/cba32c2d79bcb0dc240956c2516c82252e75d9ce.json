The company did not disclose the details of why Hurd went on medical leave, nor the cause of his death.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s possible some shareholders might be critical that Oracle didn\u2019t disclose more information regarding the extent of Hurd\u2019s illness, David Larcker, a Stanford Graduate School of Business professor who specializes in issues of corporate governance, said in an email. But this is \u201ca very hard governance problem, because the board has to balance the shareholder \u2018right to know\u2019 with the personal privacy issues,\u201d Larcker said.\n\nAD\n\nHurd previously led Hewlett-Packard, including when the company\u2019s media leak investigation spiraled into a spying scandal in 2006. He stepped down from HP in 2010 amid allegations of sexual harassment and falsified expense reports. Hurd denied the allegations at the time.\n\nThe company said that its investigation ultimately cleared Hurd of the sexual harassment charges but that he had violated HP\u2019s conduct standards. Reuters reported at the time that HP found Hurd had filed inaccurate expense reports to conceal a \u201cclose personal relationship.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLater that year, Ellison named Hurd and Catz as co-presidents of Oracle. In 2014, when Ellison stepped down as CEO, he named the pair to replace him. Ellison described Hurd in the statement Friday as a close friend and trusted colleague.\n\nHurd\u2019s death is the latest setback in what has been a difficult few years for Oracle. As the company transitions from traditional enterprise products to cloud computing, it has struggled to match competitors such as Amazon, Google and Salesforce. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAD\n\nIn July, the Pentagon issued a strong rebuke of the company, accusing it of using \u201cpoorly-informed and often manipulative speculation\u201d in a dispute over a $10 billion cloud-computing contract. A federal judge ruled against Oracle\u2019s attempt to stop the bid process. Oracle had argued that the contract should be broken into smaller contracts instead of lumped into one large procurement.\n\nAD\n\nThe contract was scheduled to be awarded in August but was delayed after Oracle, among others, complained. The Pentagon has not yet said when it will award the contract.\n\nHurd\u2019s website says he grew up in New York City and Miami, and became a competitive tennis player in high school. He attended Baylor University on a tennis scholarship and graduated in 1979 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. He later became a member of the university\u2019s board of regents.\n\nIn addition to leading HP and Oracle, Hurd previously was CEO of NCR, which makes ATMs and other business devices.\n\nHurd is survived by his wife and two daughters.\n\nAD", "description": "Hurd, 62, previously led Hewlett-Packard.", "authors": ["Marie C.
