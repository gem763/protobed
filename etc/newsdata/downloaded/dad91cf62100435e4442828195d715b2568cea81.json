This will come into force in April 2020.\n\nAnd the government has trumpeted a \u201cstrategic ambition\u201d to make all plastic packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. Another \u201ctarget\u201d is to eliminate avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042 \u2013 a timescale criticised for lacking urgency.\n\nThere\u2019s also the Plastics Pact, a voluntary initiative supported by government that counts more than 100 big British businesses as members \u2013 including Nestle, Marks & Spencer, Unilever, Procter & Gamble (P&G) and PepsiCo. At the time of the pact launch, the members were responsible for more than 80 per cent of the plastic packaging on products sold in UK supermarkets.\n\nThe firms have all signed up to four targets for 2025, including eliminating unnecessary single-use packaging and making all plastic packaging 100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable. The government has pledged \u00a380m to help businesses cut down on single-use plastic as part of its Clean Growth Challenge.\n\nBut in the light of the latest research, it may be that the policies that are mere ambitions and targets are not enough to curb our plastic addiction. Our single-use lifestyles are as wasteful as ever.\n\nAnd behind the scenes, oil and gas companies are set to encourage our addiction. Deirdre McKay from Keele University says that as electric vehicles and more efficient forms of public transport grow, demand for gasoline is falling.\n\n\u201cThe oil and gas companies who own these refineries are instead gearing up to turn what is now excess fuel into plastics for packaging,\u201d she wrote in a piece for The Conversation.\n\n\u201cAs demand for gasoline continues to decline in future, more plastics will be made directly from crude oil.\u201d\n\nMaking plastic releases carbon dioxide, as does transporting the crude oil to make it. Researchers are also concerned that incinerating plastic waste could become one of the largest sources of CO2 emissions in Europe as other industries decarbonise.\n\n\u201cMost of the estimated total natural capital cost of plastic pollution \u2013 $75bn (\u00a360bn) per year for the consumer goods sector alone \u2013 arises from carbon dioxide emissions linked to producing and transporting plastic,\u201d said Dr McKay.\n\nAs well as making more government and corporate policies legally binding, our consumption of plastic needs to be made central to dealing with the climate crisis.", "description": "We\u2019re inundated with pictures of plastic waste trashing the environment.
