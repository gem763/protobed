These people are \u201cindependent publishers, contractors\u201d but \u201cstill professional journalists,\u201d he said.\n\nMaven struck a licensing deal in June to operate Sports Illustrated with the magazine\u2019s new owner, branding company Authentic Brands Group. Magazine publisher Meredith, which earlier this year sold Sports Illustrated to Authentic Brands for $110 million, was initially supposed to run the magazine\u2019s print edition and website.\n\nSports Illustrated\u2019s new CEO, Ross Levinsohn, is the former publisher of the Los Angeles Times and a controversial figure who was investigated on sexual harassment allegations. He was cleared of wrongdoing by the company, then called Tronc, that had owned the paper. He is a frequent collaborator with Maven\u2019s CEO, Jim Heckman, a media entrepreneur.\n\nHeckman said in a brief June interview with The Associated Press that Sports Illustrated is \u201can important treasure for the country. We\u2019re going to invest into that treasure.\u201d He said the primary focus was investment in technology for the brand.\n\nBut media watchers have been concerned about the future of the magazine under Authentic Brands and Maven.\n\nSeveral Sports Illustrated staffers tweeted a petition Thursday asking Meredith and Authentic Brands to drop Maven and save the magazine.\n\nMaven said the meeting where layoffs were announced Thursday \u201cwas all Meredith.\u201d\n\nMeredith, however, said Maven made the personnel decisions that Meredith communicated to staffers. \u201cGoing forward, the remaining SI employees will work at the direction and at the pleasure of Maven,\u201d Meredith said in a statement.\n\nAuthentic Brands did not reply to questions.\n\nSports Illustrated began publishing in 1954 and is known for its in-depth coverage of sports as well as its an annual swimsuit edition. It has struggled, however, with declining circulation, the emergence of digital rivals and the exodus of advertising dollars to online outlets.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sports Illustrated\u2019s new manager said Thursday that the 65-year-old sports magazine is cutting more than 40 jobs out of a staff of 150.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tali Arbel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/sports_illustrated-layoffs_73845_c0-387-2103-1613_s1770x1032.jpg?ec37040d021fc6c9f53dda3b823f08d493d81cdb"}
