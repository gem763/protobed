He did not identify the companies.\n\nAdvocates of direct listings, the route taken by Spotify Technology and Slack Technologies, say they offer companies a better alternative to the traditional initial public offerings underwritten by investment banks.\n\nIn a direct listing, companies list existing shares on the stock exchange without issuing new shares or raising new funds.", "description": "Venture capitalists have invited more than 100 start-ups to a meeting where they hope to convince them to go public through direct stock exchange listings rather than IPOs.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105152148-NUP_182671_1261.JPG?v=1524502953", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
