Nobody considered the coloniser/colonised issues clearly represented here at all did they?\u2019\n\nHowever, some were left impressed by what they saw and enthused: \u2018I think The British Tribe Next Door is going to turn out as one of the most fascinating programmes I have ever seen.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not insulting to the Namibians, but a total wake up call for us. By the end of it, I bet we\u2019ll all look differently at our live.\u2019\n\nThe British Tribe Next Door continues Tuesday at 9.15pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
