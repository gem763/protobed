It was not immediately clear whether the raw chicken was the result of a genuine kitchen mistake or linked to the unrest in Sheung Shui.\n\nAnti-police sentiment in Hong Kong has emerged as a lightning rod in the protests that have expanded beyond activists to include shopkeepers, civil servants and students.\n\nSince concerns about a controversial extradition bill emerged in March, riot police have unleashed tear gas and fired water cannons and rubber bullets at demonstrators, 1,200 of whom have been detained on protest-related charges. The police response has spurred an increasingly violent reaction from protesters, with recent reports of activists setting fires on the street and throwing bricks at law enforcement personnel.\n\nIn July, a picture surfaced of a young female protester lying on the ground with blood streaming from her eye and what appeared to be a police-fired bean bag nearby.
