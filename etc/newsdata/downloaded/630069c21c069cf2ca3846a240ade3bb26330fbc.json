He also wants to replace federal student loans with a $50,000 grant that students could use to enroll at public or private colleges as well as vocational schools.\n\nJohnson said he had officially applied to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp for the appointment to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), who is resigning at the end of the year. He said he submitted an application through the online portal that Kemp has set up to attract interested candidates. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll see the merit of talking to me,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSeveral prominent Republicans are also seeking the appointment, including Trump\u2019s former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Rep. Doug Collins and former Reps. Paul Broun and Jack Kingston.\n\n\u201cI hope to get appointed, but also got to be looking towards the win in November 2020,\u201d Johnson said, referring to the special election next year. He left open the possibility that he would still run for the seat even if he didn\u2019t get Kemp\u2019s appointment but said it would depend on who was appointed.\n\nA. Wayne Johnson in 2017.\n\nJohnson acknowledged his student loan relief , which would require congressional action, goes beyond the Democratic presidential candidates' proposals.\n\n\u201cI do respect Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for bringing the nature of the discussion forward,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBut they \u201chaven't thought through secondary and tertiary implications,\u201d he said, calling the Democratic plans an \u201cintended government takeover of post-high school education.\u201d\n\nJohnson said his plan \u2014 which would completely eliminate student loan debt for 37 million Americans \u2014 would be paid for with a new 1 percent tax on revenue generated \u201cby all employers including corporations and nonprofit organizations.\u201d\n\nJohnson insisted he could get Republicans, who generally oppose new taxes, behind his ideas. He noted that GOP lawmakers have long been critical of the federal student loan program.\n\n\u201cInstead of continuing to run a misguided loan program, we actually need to deal with it in a different fashion,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans \u201cunderstand the concept of investment, and particularly an investment in human capital,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat's really the way it's got to be understood and embraced.\u201d\n\nJohnson pointed to a 2018 study by the Levy Economics Institute on the macroeconomic benefits of student loan cancellation, calling it a \u201cvery important piece of work.\u201d Johnson said he also drew inspiration for the $50,000 voucher for higher education from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 student loan financing plan.\n\nDeVos appointed Johnson in 2017 as the top Education Department official overseeing all federal financial aid. Johnson stepped down from that post about six months later to lead a \u201cstrategy and innovation\u201d office at the department. He has helped spearhead the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to overhaul how the department collects federal student loans.\n\nAs head of the Office of Federal Student Aid, Johnson oversaw the companies that are hired to collect federal student loans as well as the public service loan forgiveness program, which has been plagued by a high denial rate. Democrats have sharply criticized the department\u2019s management of the program and have said the Trump administration isn\u2019t doing enough to police the loan companies.\n\nJohnson said he had been considering the Senate campaign \u201cfor a few months\u201d and had been strategizing \u201cwith a couple of friends in the evenings and weekends\u201d while working at the Education Department.\n\nJohnson said he told DeVos about his intention to pursue the open Senate seat several days ago, but said he didn\u2019t tell her he planned to endorse sweeping student loan forgiveness or make it a centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nMany Republicans, including DeVos, have been sharply critical of proposals to cancel large amounts of student loan debt. DeVos blasted Democrats\u2019 plans as \u201ccrazy\u201d as recently as last week during an interview on Fox News.\n\nAsked whether he was a Trump supporter, Johnson said: \u201cI'm highly supportive of the Republican focus under the Republican administration,\u201d adding that \u201cthe Trump administration, obviously led by President Trump himself, is doing some amazingly good work.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.
