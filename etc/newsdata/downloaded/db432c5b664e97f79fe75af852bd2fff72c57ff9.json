We are as committed as ever to serving our members, enterprise customers, landlord partners, employees and shareholders,\" the company's newly-appointed co-CEOs, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, said in a joint statement on Monday.\n\nTimothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"We have every intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future,\" the statement added.\n\nNeumann stepped down as CEO after reportedly facing immense pressure from board members. It was announced, however, that he will stay on in a non-executive role as chairman of the board.\n\nWeWork was founded by Neumann in New York City in 2010 and provides freelancers, startups and others with rentable office space they can access through an app and site. It boasts 834 locations, currently open or upcoming, spread out across 125 cities, according to its website.\n\nWhile trendy and offering amenities such as stocked kitchens, pet-friendly locations and \"art-infused buildings,\" some critics have questioned the company's actual value as it works to go public.\n\nAs a private company, WeWork was recently valued by private investors at around $47 billion, according to The Associated Press. That figure has come under scrutiny from many investors and even lawmakers.\n\nAt a hearing earlier this month of the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services\u2019 Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., cited WeWork's transition to the public market as an example of a potential risk for everyday investors Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets.\n\n\"They just decided overnight, 'Just kidding, we're worth $20 billion,'\" citing media reports speculating WeWork's IPO value, adding: \"If you invested in WeWork thinking that it had a valuation of $47 billion, you're getting fleeced.\"\n\nThe We Company, which is the parent company of WeWork, had reportedly planned to seek a valuation between $10 billion and $12 billion, significantly lower than the $47 billion suggested by private investors, Reuters reported earlier this month.", "description": "Less than a week ago, WeWork's co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down as CEO of the co-working startup.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/wework-gty-jt-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
