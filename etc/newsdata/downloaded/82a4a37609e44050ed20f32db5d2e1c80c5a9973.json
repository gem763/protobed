It is time to institutionalize successful past experiences to enrich the country's governance capacity and to ensure high-quality development,\" Xue said.\n\n\"The country is also shifting away from simply using market size or low-cost labor to draw investment. Now the focus is more about leveraging its institutional advantages to attract investment,\" he added.\n\nOver the past few years, China has accelerated the improvement of its economic governance, legislation and the practice of rule of law in business sectors.\n\nSeveral major regulations and laws including the regulation on optimizing the business environment issued by the State Council and the Foreign Investment Law \u2014 which aims to better protect the legitimate rights of foreign businesses \u2014 will be officially effective next year. The country's lawmakers are also hoping to complete amendments to the much-anticipated Securities Law, the fundamental legislation that governs the country's capital markets, by the end of this year.\n\nAnalysts said that deepening legal and administrative reform, transforming the roles of the government in economic activities and creating a level playing field and a transparent business environment hold far-reaching significance as the country's economic expansion decelerates and the economy undergoes a long-term transition toward an innovation- and consumption-driven growth model.\n\nLiu Junhai, director of the Business Law Center at Renmin University of China, said advancing the rule of law is key to China's efforts to improve economic governance, solve major problems and contain risks amid the process of deepening reforms and spurring development.\n\n\"Policymakers should continue to streamline government roles, cut red tape and optimize government services to nurture a fair, consistent and predictable business environment. They should also push for better coordination between the government and the market to ensure that when the market fails, regulations and administrative functions don't,\" Liu said.\n\nEconomic legislation and amendments to existing laws should also focus on better protection of consumer and investor rights and interests in order to boost consumption and investment as the two will continue to be the main economic growth drivers, he added.\n\nXue said that improving economic governance should ensure a level playing field for private companies and State-owned enterprises to help foster fair market competition.\n\nBusinesses are also looking forward to more legal action to safeguard intellectual property and encourage innovation.\n\n\"Under the current international situation, it is very important to strengthen protection of IPR,\" said Liu Qingfeng, chairman of Chinese artificial intelligence company iFlytek.\n\nLiu also called for more efforts to organize training sessions to enhance the awareness and ability of private entrepreneurs to better protect their patents. \"Specific laws could be rolled out to punish employees who leak commercial secrets and patents to others so as to protect enterprises' intangible assets,\" he said.\n\nContact the writers at lixiang@chinadaily.com.cn", "description": "China is likely to see breakthroughs in improving its business environment and the rule of law in economic fields to better unleash the country's growth potential and ensure high-quality development.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/31/5db9edc3a310cf3e97a399e2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
