That\u2019s according to publicly released transcripts, as well as people familiar with the private testimony to impeachment investigators. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it.\n\nSeveral witnesses have testified that Trump believed Ukraine wanted to destroy his presidency.\n\nOne career State Department official, George Kent, told lawmakers that Putin and Orb\u00e1n had soured Trump\u2019s attitude toward Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine have been foes since Putin\u2019s invasion of Crimea in 2014, as Kyiv tries to align with the West, while Putin and Orban grow closer.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was skeptical,\u201d Sondland testified, according to his written remarks. Sondland said that only later did he understand that Trump, by connecting the Ukrainians with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, was interested in probing the 2016 election as well as the family of his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden.\n\nSee: Jovanovitch tells Congress that Trump pushed State Department to oust her as ambassador to Ukraine\n\n\u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing President Trump\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower filed a complaint that included Trump\u2019s July call with Zelensky. The call was placed the day after Mueller testified to Congress and brought an end to the two-year Trump-Russia probe.\n\n\u201cOur country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\n\u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nTrump was airing the conspiracy-theory view, shared by Giuliani, that the security firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate the 2016 hack of its email, may have had ties to Ukraine.\n\nSee: \u2018We are an independent country\u2019: Zelensky says Ukraine cannot be ordered to probe Biden\n\nCrowdStrike determined in June 2016 that Russian agents had broken into the committee\u2019s network and stolen emails that were subsequently published by WikiLeaks. The firm\u2019s findings were confirmed by FBI investigators and helped lead to Mueller\u2019s indictments of 12 individuals from Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never been a CrowdStrike fan \u2014 I mean, this whole thing of a server.\u2019 Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican\n\nBut the loose conspiracy theory contends that the DNC email hack was a setup, bolstered by fake computer records, designed to cast blame on Russia. Even the president\u2019s Republican allies have tried to dissuade Trump from it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a CrowdStrike fan \u2014 I mean, this whole thing of a server,\u201d said Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina last week.\n\nMeadows, a confidant of Trump, said he\u2019s sure Ukraine had some role in the U.S. election. But he views the search for the email server as farfetched. \u201cI would not, on my dime, send a private attorney looking for some server in a foreign country,\u201d Meadows told reporters.\n\nPerhaps contributing to the conspiracy theories surrounding CrowdStrike and the DNC is the fact that the FBI never took possession of the actual computer server that would have held the hacked emails.\n\nInstead, the FBI relied on the forensics provided by CrowdStrike.\n\nThe FBI had \u201crepeatedly stressed\u201d to the DNC its desire to have access to servers, former FBI Director James Comey testified at a March 2017 hearing before a House panel. But he acknowledged it is not unusual for the FBI to use such forensics in place of the actual hard drive during cyber investigations.\n\nOther Republicans have also tried to convince Trump it was not Ukraine that was involved.\n\nTrump\u2019s former homeland-security adviser, Tom Bossert, said Giuliani had done Trump a disservice by pushing the false story.\n\n\u201cI am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president,\u201d Bossert said in September on ABC. \u201cIt sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again,\u201d said Bossert, who also was an adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cThat conspiracy theory has got to go. They have to stop with that. It cannot continue to be repeated.\u201d\n\nOn the call, Trump went on to ask Zelensky to also look into Burisma, the Ukraine gas company on whose board of directors Biden\u2019s son Hunter served when the then\u2013vice president was the Obama administration\u2019s main emissary to Ukraine.\n\nLast week, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, acknowledged that Trump essentially engaged in a quid pro quo in seeking Zelensky\u2019s help in exchange for military aid the White House was withholding from Ukraine.\n\nMulvaney said the request was not improper because Trump wanted help with the 2016 investigation rather than looking ahead to 2020. It is against the law to seek or receive help of value from a foreign entity in U.S. elections.\n\nMulvaney later revised his comments, saying, \u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\u201d", "description": "Behind closed doors, President Donald Trump has made his views on Ukraine clear: \u201cThey tried to take me down.\u201d", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS338_trump__ZG_20190930154540.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
