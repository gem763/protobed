It wasn't pretty, but San Francisco is 6-0 for the third time in franchise history, and first since 1990.\n\n\"It takes you back to being a kid: You're out there, you're sloshing around and your shoes are full of water and mud,\" cornerback Richard Sherman said. \"It's still a kid's game at the end of the day. Guys had a lot of fun slipping and sliding out there, but winning's always fun.\"\n\nSan Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan thought about flopping onto his old home field with his players, but watched them gleefully instead after beating the team that fired him and his father, Mike, in 2013. Shanahan knew from his time in Washington how bad the FedEx Field surface can be in normal weather and adjusted along the way.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers wide receiver Kendrick Bourne rushes the ball in the second half.

Garoppolo bounced back from a dreadful first half to finish a passable 12 of 21 for 151 yards passing.\n\nRobbie Gould made field goals from 28, 22 and 29 yards to provide the only offence of the game.\n\nSan Francisco's defence continued its dominant run after holding the Los Angeles Rams to seven points last week and the Cleveland Browns to three before that. The Niners are the first team since 2005 and sixth since 1990 to limit an opponent to seven or fewer points and fewer than 200 net yards of offence in three consecutive games.\n\nAfter the team's first shutout since Week 1 of the 2016 season \u2014 forcing Adrian Peterson to fumble in the third quarter \u2014 defensive lineman DeForest Buckner was upset the defence only got one turnover.\n\nCovered in mud: offensive guard Mike Person of the San Francisco 49ers looks on after making a tackle on Washington defensive back Troy Apke, unseen, during the third quarter.

Washington (1-6) started the game with 10 rushing plays and Peterson ran for 81 yards on 20 carries, but they were shut out for the first time this season.\n\n\"It was tough sledding,\" Peterson said. \"We knew coming in that, especially with the rain, it was going to be that type of game, the field was muddy. I felt like we started off well, had an opportunity to put points on the board. We weren't successful with that.\"\n\nRedskins lineman Ereck Flowers wasn't sure why 49ers players did mud angels and slid all over the field in celebration, but put it on Washington for letting it happen.\n\n\"Winning is the cure for everything,\" Flowers said. \"If we won the game, there wouldn't be no sliding.\"", "description": "Nick Bosa sacked Case Keenum to run out the clock, belly flopped onto the field and rode it like a Slip 'N Slide.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5328421.1571609007!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/49ers-washington-101919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
