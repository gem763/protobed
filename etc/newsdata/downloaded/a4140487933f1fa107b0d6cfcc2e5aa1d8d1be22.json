I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record.\u201d\n\nHarris, one of two major African American 2020 contenders, will instead host students from around Columbia, S.C. for a criminal justice roundtable. The California Democrat previously served as her state\u2019s attorney general.\n\nTrump at his event Friday touted his administration\u2019s achievements for African Americans, noting his efforts on criminal justice reform and the record-low unemployment rate among blacks.\n\nHowever, earlier this week he received bipartisan rebukes for comparing House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching,\u201d with critics saying he ignored the racial history of such attacks.\n\nThe president has a long history of facing accusations of racism, including allegations that he would not rent out property to black residents and his persistent claims that the now-exonerated \u201cCentral Park Five,\u201d five young men of color who were wrongfully convicted, should have been put to death.\n\nSaturday will be Harris' 13th visit to South Carolina as a presidential candidate. The California lawmaker is hoping to make up ground to win over black voters, who comprise a majority of the Democratic primary electorate in the Palmetto State.", "description": "White House hopeful Sen.
