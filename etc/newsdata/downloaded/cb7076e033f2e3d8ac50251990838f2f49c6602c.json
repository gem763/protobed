Gavin Newsom on Friday.\n\nThe recently-signed law also bans the disposal of cigarette butts and cigar waste at state parks and beaches. Those who violate the law are subject to a fine of up to $25, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe law covers both e-cigarettes as well as traditional cigarettes, and will allow people to smoke in parking lots of beaches and state parks.\n\nFilm and television productions that film in state parks with proper permitting can still allow people to smoke on state property.\n\nDemocrat state lawmakers have tried for years to approve a smoking ban, with lawmakers passing such a bill several times only for it to be vetoed once it reached former Democrat Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cThird time is not always a charm,\u201d Brown wrote in his veto message. \u201cMy opinion on the matter has not changed. We have many rules telling us what we can\u2019t do and these are wide open spaces.\u201d\n\nBrown and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, vetoed a total of seven bills sent to them over the past decade on a smoking ban, saying the ban involved \u201cexcessive punishment.\u201d Many Republicans in the legislature also voted against the measure.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Steve Glazer, who sponsored the legislation, argued that the rule would benefit public health and limit pollution.\n\nCalifornia already bans smoking at childcare centers, within 25 feet of farmer\u2019s markets, on public transportation, and within government buildings.\n\nThe state has 280 state parks and roughly 340 miles of coastline.\n\nThe recently signed law does not come cheap. A legislative analysis predicted that it would cost California\u2019s state parks system nearly $2 million to enforce the ban and place 5,000 signs at each of its state parks to ensure compliance with the law.", "description": "California will ban smoking and vaping at its state parks and beaches under legislation signed by Democrat Gov.
