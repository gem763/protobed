In the centre of the meadow were the remnants of an abandoned log cabin and beside it a rusted shovel and chisel \u2014 the tools of a gold prospector from decades ago.\n\n\"We think that this prospector was after Slumach's gold, if he hadn't already found it,\" Palmer explained, his voice brimming with optimism.\n\nMining tools and the remains of an abandoned prospector\u2019s cabin, which Adam Palmer believes are important clues to finding the lost gold mine. (Submitted by Julien Kenchenten)\n\nClosing in on a legend\n\nOver the past century, hundreds \u2014 maybe even thousands \u2014 of people have looked for the fabled mine, which is said to be worth billions. Several prospectors have died trying to find it, others have gone missing. To date, no one has ever conclusively located it.\n\nBut with his discovery of the prospector's cabin, Palmer believes he is finally getting close. In addition to the cabin and mining tools, Palmer found an old glass jar that contained ore and what appeared to be gold.\n\nWe'd flown to the cabin site in a helicopter (he works for the company as an outdoor guide) so he could show me these clues firsthand, on the ground.\n\nThe view out of the helicopter in the area where Slumach\u2019s gold is supposedly located, near Pitt Lake, British Columbia. (Submitted by Julian Kenchenten)\n\nPalmer planned to return a few weeks later to search the surrounding mountains for the mine. Slumach's gold, he believed, was finally within reach.\n\nI had one niggling question \u2014 does this mythic mine actually exist?\n\nWho was Slumach?\n\nA photograph of a man alleged to be Slumach that appeared in an article in the Montreal Standard, on November 25, 1939. (The same photograph later appeared in another article written by the same writer about a different man charged with murder, suggesting the photograph is not legitimate.) The story of Slumach's gold is a curious mix of fact and folklore. It begins in the late 1800s, when an Indigenous man known only as Slumach was found guilty of murder and hanged in New Westminster, B.C.\n\nNot long after his death, rumours began to surface that Slumach had discovered a lucrative \u2014 and hidden \u2014 stash of gold in the mountains, near Pitt Lake. Slumach, it was said, would bring walnut-sized nuggets of gold into saloons in New Westminster.\n\nJust before Slumach was hanged, it was rumoured that he muttered a curse on anyone who dared to search for his gold mine: \"Nika memloose, mine memloose.\" Loosely translated from the Chinook language, the words mean \"When I die, the mine dies.\"\n\nThere's little evidence to support any of the story, particularly the curse, but rumours of Slumach's gold began to attract more prospectors to the area.\n\nIn the 1930s, hundreds of prospectors travelled into the mountains around Pitt Lake every summer in search of the gold, according to Rick Antonson, co-author of the book Slumach's Gold: The Search for a Legend.\n\nAnd they didn't all make it back.\n\n\"The tally done by mainstream media years ago was that 33 or more [people] had fallen victims to the curse,\" said Antonson, who, along with his brother Brian, has been fascinated with the Slumach story since he was a kid.\n\nBrian and Rick Antonson have been enthralled by the legend of Slumach's gold since they were told the story by a campfire as children. Along with friend Mary Trainer, the brothers co-authored a book in 1972 called Slumach\u2019s Gold: The Search for a Legend, which they updated several times since with new information. (Brad Badelt/CBC)\n\n\"We know the curse didn't exist, but we also know that it's treacherous territory.\"\n\nSeveral prospectors have even claimed to have found the gold. In the 1970s, for example, a forest surveyor named Stu Brown said he stumbled onto a stream near Pitt Lake that was ankle-deep with gold nuggets. But Brown was never able to pinpoint the location again.\n\nA map of the area where Slumach\u2019s gold is supposedly located, from the 1972 edition of Slumach\u2019s Gold: The Search for a Legend. (With permission from the authors)\n\nAn elaborate hoax?\n\nBut for all those who believe in Slumach's gold, there are others who think it's just a hoax. Fred Braches, a local historian who recently published a book titled Searching for Pitt Lake Gold: Facts and Fantasy in the Legend of Slumach, says there's no evidence for most of the story.\n\nSlumach was real, Braches says, \"but he had nothing to do with gold.\" Braches believes that the story of Slumach's gold was created by locals in the Pitt Lake area to draw prospectors. More prospectors meant more jobs for guides and outfitters.\n\nFred Braches, author of Searching for Pitt Lake Gold: Facts and Fantasy in the Legend of Slumach, doesn\u2019t believe the lost gold mine exists. (Brad Badelt/CBC)\n\n\"There is no gold,\" says Braches, \"but it is gold in somebody's mind, and that is important. People are looking for what they believe is there.\"\n\nBut even today, there's still a small community of people searching for the lost mine, sharing trip reports and swapping clues through Facebook and online message boards.\n\n\"You meet up and another story, another piece of the puzzle, comes out,\" Palmer says.\n\nThe thrill of the hunt\n\nFor these modern-day searchers, like Palmer, it's not about the money. Not anymore, at least. Much of the area where Slumach's gold is supposedly hidden is within the boundaries of Pinecone Burke and Golden Ears provincial parks, where mining for gold is prohibited.\n\nFor Palmer, the search for Slumach's gold is about the thrill of the hunt \u2014 trying to solve a mystery that no one else has been able to.\n\n\"If someone finds this gold,\" he said, \"you are now the hero of a bunch of men who have been looking for so many years.\"\n\nAdam Palmer inspecting what might be the tent-shaped rock described in a letter from a dying prospector named Jackson, who claimed to have found Slumach\u2019s gold. (Brad Badelt/CBC)\n\nMore than that, he says the search for the lost gold \u2014 all the dead ends and long days \u2014 has been about sharing the adventure with friends, some of whom he does trips with year after year.\n\n\"It's all about the time that you spend,\" he said. \"It adds memories and those memories \u2014 that's the real gold.\"\n\nAfter our helicopter trip in July, Palmer returned to the cabin site a few weeks later to search for the lost mine. And that's when he made another surprising discovery: gold.\n\nNot a lot of gold \u2014 just a few tiny flakes, but still. He found it while panning a stream near the abandoned cabin.\n\n\"I thought I was gonna drop it,\" said Palmer, \"and I knew that no one would believe me.\"\n\nHe plans to go back again next summer, to find Slumach's mine once and for all.\n\nAdam\u2019s pan with tiny flakes of gold in the bottom.
