Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s \u2018official apology to China\u2019 over South Park episode is pitch-perfect", "language": "en", "text": "In case you missed it, \u201cBand in China,\u201d last week\u2019s episode of \u201cSouth Park\u201d was characteristically excellent. It was also highly, highly problematic \u2014 for the Chinese government, that is. China was so offended, in fact, that they\u2019ve tried to purge it from Chinese media.\n\nHere's how China reacted to that #SouthPark episode \"Band in China\": https://t.co/TEvuGAf02S \u2014 Hollywood Reporter (@THR) October 7, 2019\n\nMore from the Hollywood Reporter:\n\nThe most recent episode of South Park, \u201cBand in China,\u201d has been generating loads of media attention for its sharp critique of the way Hollywood tends to shape its content to avoid offending Chinese government censors in any way whatsoever. Now, those very same government censors, in the real world, have lashed back at South Park by deleting virtually every clip, episode and online discussion of the show from Chinese streaming services, social media and even fan pages. A cursory perusal through China\u2019s highly regulated Internet landscape shows the show conspicuously absent everywhere it recently had a presence. A search of the Twitter-like social media service Weibo turns up not a single mention of South Park among the billions of past posts. On streaming service Youku, owned by Internet giant Alibaba, all links to clips, episodes and even full seasons of the show are now dead. And on Baidu\u2019s Tieba, China\u2019s largest online discussions platform, the threads and sub-threads related to South Park are nonfunctional. If users manually type in the URL for what was formerly the South Park thread, a message appears saying that, \u201cAccording to the relevant law and regulation, this section is temporarily not open.\u201d The draconian response is par for the course for China\u2019s authoritarian government, which has even been known to aggressively censor Winnie the Pooh, because some local Internet users had affectionately taken to comparing Chinese president Xi Jinping to the character.\n\nIt should come as no surprise to those familiar with \u201cSouth Park\u201d that its creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely devastated. How devastated? This devastated:\n\nBe still our hearts.\n\nNailed it\u2026 pic.twitter.com/V9Jt3Fva0X \u2014 I'm supposed to be whistle-blowing right now\u2026 (@hereforthejava) October 7, 2019\n\nThis statement in gif form\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5c277Wh89V \u2014 Andrew Follett (@AndrewCFollett) October 7, 2019\n\nOh South Park. lol You did it again!\n\nNice. \u2014 Rob Wob (@ra_wob) October 7, 2019\n\nThis is why you lot are the best \u2014 JJ Hunt (@OfficialJJHunt) October 7, 2019\n\nI love you guys \u2014 Shalin\ud83e\uddd4\ud83c\udffb (@realShaySmooth) October 7, 2019\n\nMY GOD.
