The data appeared on the New York Fed\u2019s website on Monday due to \u201ctechnical difficulties,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nBloomberg News published an article on the data a couple of hours earlier, saying the report had briefly become available on the regional Fed\u2019s website.\n\nThe Empire State index is closely watched as one of the first indicators of a month\u2019s manufacturing activity.\n\nRecent reports have been flat, as the factory sector in the region has suffered from the trade war between the U.S. and China, the sluggish global economy and the strong dollar.\n\nThe report released Monday shows that a rebound in sentiment pushed the headline Empire State index up to 4 in October from 2 in the prior month. Economists has been expecting a 0.8 reading, according to Econoday. Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions.\n\nThe new-orders index was unchanged at 3.5. Shipments rose 7.2 points to 13. Optimism about the future improved somewhat but remained relatively subdued.\n\n\u201cOverall, this is a modest report suggesting manufacturing in the New York region is still growing with some positive underlying trends including growing new orders and falling inventory levels,\u201d said T.J. Connelly, head of research at ContingentMacro.\n\nThe early release on the indicator is the latest black eye for a regional Fed bank that had already come under criticism for reacting slowly to turbulence in short-term lending markets.\n\n\u201cGiven the New York Fed has come under pretty intense scrutiny, it doesn\u2019t increase our confidence any, but it\u2019s a pretty small error in the grand scheme of things,\u201d said Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economics professor and the author of the Fed Watch blog.\n\nSee: Fed says it will start to buy Treasury bills next week to ease money-market pressure\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.14% were both down 0.1% in the final hour of trades on Monday.", "description": "The Empire State factory index inched up to 4 in October from 2 in the prior month, according to data released early by the New York Fed.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT266_empire_MG_20191014141757.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
