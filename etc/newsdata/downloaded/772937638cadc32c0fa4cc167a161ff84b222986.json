The team, led by investigative editor Michael Squires, published the five-part series \u201cThe Charter Gamble,\u201d which examined how Arizona committed 25 years ago to the then-untested concept of charter schools and what the program has meant for the state.\n\nThe George Polk Awards in Journalism were established in 1949 by Long Island University to commemorate CBS correspondent George Polk, who was murdered while covering the Greek civil war, and are presented annually to honor special achievement in journalism, especially investigative and enterprising reporting that gains attention and achieves results. The Republic\u2019s team was recognized at the 70th annual Polk Awards announcement ceremony for \"initially disclosing insider deals, no-bid contracts and political chicanery that provided windfall profits for investors in a number of prominent Arizona charter schools, often at the expense of underfunded public schools.\"\n\nGreg Burton, executive editor of The Republic and azcentral.com, said the reporting team \"unspooled miles of red tape to reveal what had been hidden during a decades-long push to funnel public money to privately run public charter schools \u2014 oftentimes with noble intent. But, where regulators and politicians fail as watchdogs, local reporters are vital. In this case, politicians and businessmen who could have pushed for reform made millions by ignoring warning signs. This is where Republic reporters worked to protect the public\u2019s trust.\u201d\n\nIn response to The Republic\u2019s reporting on charter schools, legislation for reform is under consideration and has bipartisan support. This impactful journalism is a strong example of the kind of reporting the USA TODAY NETWORK is emphasizing as it expands its coverage of education issues.\n\nMore than 50 reporters across the USA TODAY NETWORK cover education, working together for national stories. This school year, that team is jointly focusing on the pressure on America\u2019s teachers. In the fall, the team followed 15 teachers around the country to show the shared feeling of disrespect among teachers, no matter where they work.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/02/22/arizona-republic-wins-george-polk-award-education-reporting/2954763002/", "description": "Reporters at The Arizona Republic were honored with a prestigious Polk Award for their reporting on state charter schools.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
