(AP) \u2014 The lengthy list of 2020 presidential hopefuls started growing longer Wednesday as the filing period opened for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.\n\nThe date for the primary hasn't been set, but it's expected to be held Feb. 11, eight days after the leadoff Iowa caucuses. Potential candidates have until Nov. 15 to add their names to the Democratic or Republican ballot, and dozens are expected to do in part because it's relatively cheap and easy: meet the basic requirements to be president, fill out a one-page form and pay a $1,000 filing fee.\n\nPolitical gadfly Mark Stewart Greenstein, who was the first to sign up for the 2016 primary, was first this time, too, handing over a stack of $50 bills just after the secretary of state's office opened at 8 a.m.\n\nFour years ago, the West Hartford, Connecticut, man said his goal was to stop Hillary Clinton, who ended up winning the Democratic nomination. This time, he's trying to generate momentum for a new party called EPIC, which stands for Every Politically Independent Citizen.\n\n\"This candidacy is an attempt to maybe plumb how voters really feel. When you're only presented with a choice of a far-left, high-polling threesome ... or a Republican that they paint as odious no matter who it is, it's a tough choice for moderate Democrats, it's a tough choice for independents,\" he said. \"We'd like to have other people running to make the choices easier.\"\n\nThis is the second time that candidates are signing up at the desk of the man who started New Hampshire's tradition of holding the earliest presidential primary.\n\nIn 1913, Rep. Stephen Bullock traveled by horse and buggy from his Richmond farm to Concord to propose a bill creating the primary. The Legislature passed it that spring, and after some tweaking of the law two years later, the first presidential primary was a held in March 1916. New Hampshire wasn't first that year, but has been first every year since.\n\nFor the 2016 election, 58 candidates got on New Hampshire's ballot. The all-time high was 1992, when 61 signed up.", "description": "The lengthy list of 2020 presidential hopefuls started growing longer Wednesday as the filing period opened for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.
