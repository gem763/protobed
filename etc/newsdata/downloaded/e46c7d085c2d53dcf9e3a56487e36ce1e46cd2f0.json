Perhaps the most enduring is that the company knows how to make a great portable gaming experience. From the groundbreaking Game & Watch to the original Game Boy brick to the strangely enticing dual-screened DS, Nintendo has always made hardware you want to hold in your hands and play with. It\u2019s a company that understands gaming on the go.\n\nIn 2017, it took that idea in a different direction with the Switch, which blurred the line between a traditional handheld and a home gaming console. It was a tablet you could play wherever you wanted but also slide into a dock to play games on your television. There was no division between console games and portable games. There were just games. For many people, myself included, this allowed them to play games on their own terms, wherever and whenever they were able. Considering how demanding a hobby this can be, it was a freeing notion.\n\nNow things have come full circle with the $199 Switch Lite, which hits stores starting on September 20th. It\u2019s a smaller and cheaper version of the device that cuts out a core feature: you can\u2019t hook up a Switch Lite to your TV. It\u2019s designed exclusively for playing in handheld mode. With the original Switch, Nintendo proved that games didn\u2019t have to be designed around hardware, and that with the right device, you could enjoy the same game in a variety of places and situations. With the Switch Lite, the company has proved something very different: it can still build one hell of a handheld.\n\nOur review of Nintendo Switch Lite Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Streamlined, sturdier design\n\nImproved battery life\n\nExcellent directional pad Bad Stuff Can\u2019t connect to a TV\n\nSome games aren\u2019t compatible out of the box\n\nNo kickstand Buy for $199.96 from Amazon Buy for $199.99 from Best Buy\n\nAt its most basic, the Switch Lite really is just a smaller Switch. It has a 5.5-inch touchscreen, compared to the original\u2019s 6.2-inch display, and it\u2019s overall much tinier. The Switch Lite clocks in at 3.6 inches high, 8.2 inches long, and 0.55 inches deep. It\u2019s extremely light, at a minuscule 0.61 pounds, so it\u2019s a lot easier on your arms if you want to play some Zelda in bed. The controller layout is largely the same, and it has the same slots for game cards and a microSD card. And yes, there\u2019s a headphone jack. (Though, if you thought the lack of detachable controllers would mean Bluetooth headphone support, you\u2019re out of luck). It also runs the exact same, fairly basic operating system as the base Switch, and Nintendo says it has three to seven hours of battery life. That\u2019s proved largely true during my time with it so far. I tested a lot of different kinds of games and generally had to recharge every four or five hours.\n\nThere are obvious things about the Switch Lite that are demonstrably worse than its predecessor. In order to get that smaller size and price point, Nintendo had to cut out key features, most notably the detachable controls, built-in rumble, and the ability to connect to a television set. But what remains is, in many ways, an improvement on the original.\n\nAGREE TO CONTINUE: NINTENDO SWITCH LITE Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. To use the Nintendo Switch Lite, as well as the original Switch, there\u2019s one mandatory thing you need to agree to: Nintendo\u2019s end-user license agreement. You will be forced to agree to it when you first boot up your Switch and go through the set-up process, inputting things like language, date, and your location. While some of those are optional, you won\u2019t be able to proceed through the process until you accept the EULA. There is also one optional thing you need to agree to if you want to get the most out of the device: A Nintendo Account, which is necessary for pretty much every online-enabled aspect of using the Switch, including buying digital games in the eShop or playing multiplayer via Switch Online. Final tally: one mandatory agreement and one optional agreement.\n\nAside from the scaling down, the biggest change is the controls. Whereas the original Switch had detachable Joy-Con controllers, on the Lite, they\u2019re built right in. This means a few things. One, you can\u2019t play any games that require detached Joy-Con controllers, like the fighting game Arms or the Labo line of DIY cardboard contraptions, out of the box. You\u2019ll need to pick up a separate set of Joy-Con to do that. But it also means the Switch Lite is a much sturdier, more streamlined device. As an all-in-one unit, it\u2019s solid, making it much better for kids or people who travel a lot. You don\u2019t feel the controls shift and move the way you do with a normal Switch. It\u2019s the kind of thing you can toss in a messenger bag and not worry about.\n\nIt also looks much better. The Switch Lite comes in three colors \u2014 gray, yellow, and teal \u2014 and the entire unit, bezel included, is a uniform shade, so you don\u2019t get the ugly black border of the original Switch. It\u2019s just a much cleaner look, and the Switch Lite\u2019s matte plastic body is also more grippy and comfortable, and less prone to smears from sweaty hands.\n\nThe screen is nearly identical to the original, aside from being smaller, yet it, too, feels like an improvement. It\u2019s not as big, sure, and it\u2019s the same resolution as the original Switch. But by shrinking things down slightly, the Lite\u2019s display actually makes games appear sharper and clearer. (It\u2019s an effect longtime Nintendo fans will remember from the impossibly small Game Boy Micro.) I tested around 20 different games, and I couldn\u2019t find anywhere they either looked worse or were unplayable because of the smaller display. Even text-heavy games like Fire Emblem: Three Houses, which has fairly small in-game text, are perfectly playable on the Lite.\n\nThe controls are also a step up due in large part to the inclusion of a proper directional pad. The original Switch featured directional buttons, which were disconnected from each other and made playing classic games \u2014 an increasingly attractive feature of the Switch \u2014 somewhat of a pain. But the new D-pad is responsive and comfortable. I tried it with a range of games, including Celeste, Super Mario Maker 2, Super Mario World, and the Mega Man Legacy Collection, and it just felt right. I\u2019m still terrible at Mega Man 2, but at least now it\u2019s my fault for missing a jump, not the controls\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s that the smaller size makes the controls more accessible, but I actually found that most games I played were more comfortable on the Lite. I was hitting more shots in Fortnite and getting higher scores in Sayonara Wild Hearts than I did on the regular Switch. It\u2019s anecdotal, sure, but I can definitely say that no games felt worse on a Switch Lite, but plenty felt a lot better.\n\nThe exception, of course, is any game that requires detached Joy-Con controllers. It\u2019s very easy to connect additional Joy-Con or other accessories like the Pok\u00e9ball Plus to the Lite \u2014 it works the same way as a standard Switch \u2014 and I had no issues with the tablet correctly reading my motion-controlled inputs. The problem is that it\u2019s awkward. The Lite doesn\u2019t have a kickstand or any way to hold it up, so you\u2019re forced to either lay it down on a flat surface or jury-rig a way for it to stand in order to play. Neither option works well, and it\u2019s not much fun crowding around the small screen, resting flat on a table, for an impromptu Mario Kart tournament. On the plus side, there are few Switch games that actually require you to detach the controllers, so this might not be an issue for some users.\n\nThe Switch Lite sits in a strange position\n\nThe question, really, is who is the Switch Lite for? It sits in a strange position. It\u2019s both better and worse than its predecessor. It\u2019s an improvement in some ways, with a crisper display and more solid design. At the same time, it loses some of the key functionality that made the Switch such a hit in the first place, and it\u2019s priced as a more budget-friendly alternative.\n\nIf you already own a Switch and love it, the Lite isn\u2019t a necessary upgrade, unless you\u2019re absolutely dying for a proper D-pad. (Even then, you have other options.) The improvements are welcome, but not drastic enough to warrant getting a whole new device. The Switch Lite is for people who are sitting on the proverbial fence: someone who liked the idea of Nintendo\u2019s tablet but couldn\u2019t quite stomach a $300 price tag and who didn\u2019t really want to play games on a TV anyway. The kind of person who just wants a machine for playing Breath of the Wild on a plane or a kid who needs the latest Pok\u00e9mon to fill those quiet summer afternoons. If the cut features don\u2019t feel necessary to you, the Switch Lite will likely be a good option.\n\nIf you are that kind of person, you\u2019ll be grabbing a device that fits snugly into Nintendo\u2019s storied history with handheld gaming. In a world where everyone has a smartphone in their pocket and services like Apple Arcade make playing great games easier than ever, there\u2019s still a place for a dedicated device that does one specific thing. And the Switch Lite does that one thing very well.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch Lite launches on September 20th.", "description": "The Nintendo Switch Lite, which launches on September 20th, is a smaller, cheaper, and overall sleeker handheld that does away with some of the Switch\u2019s key features in pursuit of a smaller price tag.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eLqU_rs5bDgFH1q3IgSFI0T8zr4=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19086567/akrales_190820_3597_0355.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
