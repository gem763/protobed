I expected to be challenged, to be a burden, or to be brushed aside. I had nothing prepared for people who wanted to help.\n\nI was hugely fortunate that the start-up I worked at saw my transition not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity to grow.\n\nAs I began to go through the earliest steps of transitioning, the ways that I needed help quickly became apparent and were consistently met.\n\nIt was the support of the founders that empowered me to stand up in front of 50 people, at an end-of-year event, and announce proudly (although with a sense of fear and apprehension) that I was transgender, that I had decided to transition and that I was going to begin to live as who I really was - a woman.\n\nWhen Joan Westenberg realised she was transgender, one of her first concerns was what it would mean for her career. Supplied\n\nThe classic trope about start-ups is that you jump off a cliff, and you assemble an aeroplane on the way down. I was hugely fortunate that the start-up I worked at saw my transition not as an obstacle, not as a challenge, but as an opportunity to grow and become richer in who they were.\n\nI knew I wanted to start using the bathroom that aligned with my gender. And the response to the request was that if anyone had a problem with me doing that, they were the ones who weren\u2019t a culture fit - not me. The levels of support that were granted to me were limited only by what the people around me knew to give.\n\nPeople wanted to know how they could help, but had no idea how they could help. I started to write down lists of things that they could do. Without realising it, I had started writing my company\u2019s own transgender inclusion policy - a document many companies have never had before. I had no idea what I was doing at first, but I researched existing policies, took bits and pieces from different companies and non-profits who had made their own documentation public, and I began retrofitting a trans and non-binary policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I gave it to my co-workers, there was no question of whether or not they would adopt it. They took it on board and made it theirs. It became a source of security and strength to me, to know that I had a document in place that had their authority and to know it represented the guidelines for accepting, loving and working with me.\n\nTaking that policy and making it public and allowing every single technology company in Australia to adopt it, hack it and use it was a logical next step for me. I have always believed in open source work and I wanted the document to become a tool and an edge for trans people in tech. I was humbled and overwhelmed by the response I had when I launched the policy via Twitter. VC funds, tech companies, HR leads and startup founders all reached out and shared that they had taken it on board. They asked for advice, expressed that they believed in transgender rights and wanted to commit to inclusion.\n\nThe policy covers how to support trans, non-binary and gender-fluid employees through their transition by creating transition plans and educating the people who work alongside them. It includes guidance on inclusive language, on safety and reporting protocols, and on aligning the values of your company with a set of standards that will make trans people feel and be an equal and effective part of your team.\n\nAll of this is difficult, but it must change and change is possible.\n\nI see it as a leap forward for me personally and for the people I know who need the same level of support I was privileged to receive. But the truth is, there is still a long way to go. I\u2019ve had discussions with my own circle around if and when we should disclose that we\u2019re transgender or queer during job application processes, and it\u2019s a question we struggle with.\n\nI have personally analysed my response rate from expressions of interest, publishing submissions, and applications and found it has dropped by a notable percentage, despite more experience, more skills and more knowledge than I had in the past. We are crying out for basic support and acceptance.\n\nAll of this is difficult, but it must change and change is possible. We need not just other people in tech, but people everywhere to adopt the same openness and commitment to change that my coworkers showed me.", "description": "Joan Westenberg was 14 when she realised she was transgender.
