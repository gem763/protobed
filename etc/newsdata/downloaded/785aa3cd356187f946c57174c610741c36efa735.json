Morgan\u2019s father would purchase tickets for a few dollars to sit in the upper section of Griffith Stadium, and then later, RFK Stadium. His love of baseball started in those days.\n\nDecades later, the 71-year-old sat rows up from the first base line at Nationals Park this weekend with his own son, Luke, to experience the first World Series game in the District in 86 years.\n\nThey, like many of the spectators on hand to cheer on their beloved Nationals, have a bond that was strengthed further by their mutual love of the sport.\n\nEven when the Nationals dropped two games on Friday and Saturday \u2014 guaranteeing the series moves back to Houston on Tuesday for Game 6 \u2014 fans could still proudly say they attended the Fall Classic. Baseball, after all, is a sport passed down generation to generation. From fans to the players, their passion for the game started somewhere, usually at home.\n\n\u201cReal special moment,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt only comes along once in a lifetime, so I\u2019m glad we\u2019re able to share it.\u201d\n\nStarting young\n\nEliza Warren keeps score by hand for every Nationals game she attends.\n\nThe 13-year-old is a diehard baseball fan, having gotten into the game from her father. Together, the Warrens split season tickets with a group of families, so they\u2019re at Nationals Park often. Mitch Warren, Eliza\u2019s father, was raised a Philadelphia Phillies fan, but switched over when the Nationals arrived in 2005.\n\n\u201cI was just telling her to remember this,\u201d Mitch Warren said, \u201cbecause she\u2019ll be telling her children and grandchildren about it.\u201d\n\nThe District, of course, had to wait 33 years for baseball to come back to the city, after the Senators relocated to become the Texas Rangers in 1972. The departure meant people like Lorne Davidson, who was born 1970, grew up without a local team to root for. Instead, he cheered for the Rangers and the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nBut Davidson still loved the sport, specifically how there\u2019s a \u201cgame within the game,\u201d he said. The Loudoun County resident recalled how passionate his mother, grandfather and uncle were toward baseball when he was a child, causing him to become a fan.\n\nIn Mike Rizzo\u2019s case, the Nationals general manager grew up in a household where his father, Phil, was a longtime minor leaguer \u2014 and later a scout for teams like the California Angels. So, it was only natural Rizzo, a Chicago native who lived blocks from Wrigley Field, would follow in his father\u2019s footsteps.\n\nStanding near the dugout prior to Game 3, Rizzo joked the tape recorder in front of him wouldn\u2019t have enough hours to fill when asked about his father\u2019s influence.\n\n\u201cMy dad is the reason I\u2019m here,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cHe was the most important part of my career.\u201d\n\nA parent\u2019s impact\n\nEven in the heat of the World Series, when the Astros and the Nationals have gone back and forth, the players still make time for their families.\n\nOn Friday, Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera had his 12-year-old son out on the field with him when the Nationals\u2019 second baseman went through batting practice. Cabrera\u2019s son flew in from Florida to be with him, as well. Left fielder Juan Soto\u2019s family has traveled for each of the Nationals\u2019 games this series, and were in attendance this weekend.\n\nBefore he started Game 4, Astros rookie pitcher Jose Urquidy had coffee with his mother, Alma, in the morning. The 24-year-old was nervous for later that evening, but soon received words of encouragement from his mother.\n\n\u201cMy mom is someone that I talk to a lot and obviously she helped me out,\u201d said Urquidy, who threw five scoreless innings in Houston\u2019s 8-1 win.\n\nParents can also play a large role in teaching their children about baseball itself. Nationals starter Patrick Corbin revealed in an interview with MASN this summer that his father was the one who taught him how to grip his signature slider.\n\nNew generations\n\nSince bringing baseball back to the District, the Nationals have built a new generation of fans. Each World Series game was sold out this weekend with fans paying exuberant prices to get in.\n\nDon Neireiter paid $817 a seat \u2014 before fees \u2014 to attend Game 3 with his daughter, Tammy.\n\nMany this weekend experienced attending a World Series game for the first time. The last Fall Classic to take place in Washington happened in 1933. Beyond that, the next closest city to go to the World Series was the Baltimore Orioles \u2014 but that last occurred in 1983.\n\nGarner Morgan was actually at Camden Yards for that series with his father. He told his son Luke that if he ever got a chance to go to another World Series, they\u2019d go together \u2014 on one condition.\n\n\u201cHe has to buy me a hat,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cMy dad bought me a hat at that (Orioles) game. I still have it.\u201d\n\n\u2981 David Driver contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
