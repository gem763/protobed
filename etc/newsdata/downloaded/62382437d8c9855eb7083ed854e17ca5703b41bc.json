The money was raised through crowdfunding by March for Change, a network of grassroots pro-EU groups. The Johnson blimp features the prime minister wearing a T-shirt with a red bus showing the figure \u00a3350m in reference to Vote Leave\u2019s infamous claim during the 2016 referendum campaign that the country sent the sum to the EU each week.\n\nOne of March for Change\u2019s core group of a dozen organisers, Elle Dormer, revealed that the blimp is not going to be filled with helium \u201cbecause we feel that some of the wind has been taken out of his sails\u201d, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s flying less high these days. He\u2019s grounded \u2026 He\u2019s been weighed down by his troubles.\u201d\n\nDormer, a school governor from London who used to work for the Conservative party in the press office, explained that there was a worldwide helium shortage and the cost of the gas has shot up meaning \u201cit would have cost a fortune\u201d to use it.\n\nThe March for Change rally will feature speeches from former Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who defected to the Independent Group for Change earlier this year, Mandu Reid, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality Party, human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell and broadcaster Paul Mason.\n\nMeanwhile, outside Downing Street a separate protest at 2.30pm will feature speakers including the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, Green party co-leader Si\u00e2n Berry, Laura Parker, the national coordinator of Momentum, and Guardian columnist Owen Jones.\n\nA Facebook page for the \u201cStop the Coup\u201d Downing Street event \u2013 which is being organised by Another Europe is Possible, the Green Party and Momentum, among others \u2013 is calling for Johnson\u2019s resignation.\n\nIt reads: \u201cAn unelected government is attacking our democracy so that it can drive through its Brexit agenda. We don\u2019t just have the right to resist it \u2013 we have a duty. This week will change Britain for ever. Don\u2019t be silent, don\u2019t be absent \u2013 stand up and be counted.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Berry urged people to take to the streets, adding: \u201cWe are witnessing the birth of an inspiring new movement to demand democracy and a key part of that process has to be getting rid of this rotten government and remaining in the EU by giving people the final say.\n\n\u201cIf we want to stop Brexit, or make Britain a fairer place, we need to stop this abuse of power. It\u2019s not just MPs whose actions matter \u2013 we all have agency in this, and we all need to mobilise.\u201d\n\nA Momentum spokesman added: \u201cFrom proroguing parliament to disenfranchising young people, Boris Johnson is trying every trick in the book to stitch up the country and force through his no-deal, Trump-first agenda. We won\u2019t stand for yet another establishment power grab, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re backing the protest on Saturday.\u201d\n\nIt comes after tens of thousands protested in London and around the UK last weekend against Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Cost of helium keeps inflatable grounded on day of protests over decision to suspend parliament", "authors": ["Simon Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca2047e720c4926a0ff08fe60d84cc0c41dd214/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=809cdd8a3a9d06a7edc4306b8d153aca", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
