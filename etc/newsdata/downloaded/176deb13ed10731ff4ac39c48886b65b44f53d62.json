That main event was ruled a no contest after just 15 seconds.\n\nStephens isn\u2019t buying Rodriguez\u2019s tough act and said he hopes to teach him a lesson by delivering a vicious knockout. \u201cLil\u2019 Heathen,\u201d who describes himself as a savage, certainly doesn\u2019t think \u201cEl Pantera\u201d deserves to be put in the same light as him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the \u2018Karate Kid,\u2019 man,\u201d Stephens said at a UFC on ESPN 6 media day Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s a \u2018Karate Kid.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he is, bro. I think he\u2019s trying to be something that he\u2019s not, and he\u2019s going to find out the hard way come Friday night when his lights are out.\u201d\n\nThe fans in the hostile Mexico City crowd were disappointed they didn\u2019t get to see Rodriguez go to battle Sept. 21 and showered Stephens with beer and concessions on his way out of the arena.\n\nOn the bright side, Stephens said he\u2019s glad he didn\u2019t take Rodriguez out in Mexico City since he can\u2019t even imagine how the crowd would have reacted then.\n\n\u201cWhat if I would have knocked him out in Mexico? You saw how they treated me there \u2013 (they) probably would have killed me,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cIt\u2019s all good though. It\u2019s a great thing. It\u2019s going to make it that much better when I put him on the canvas and he\u2019s staring up at the lights asking what happened and I\u2019m celebrating the win. It\u2019s just going to make it that much better. After all this (expletive) that\u2019s gone down, when I put his lights out, it\u2019s going to be a great night. It\u2019s going to be a huge night for me.\u201d\n\nStephens is on a two-fight losing skid, but thinks he\u2019s very much a player in the featherweight division. With the fashion that he ends fights, he hopes to notch another stoppage victory and potentially jump into the Brian Ortega vs. Chan Sung Jung fight that is set to headline UFC on ESPN+ 23 in Busan, South Korea, in Dcecember.\n\nShould either one pull out, he\u2019d be happy to fill in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll look to be next in line for if \u2018Zombie\u2019 or Ortega drops off, so you bet your ass I\u2019ll fight one or two more times by the end of the year if it\u2019s possible,\u201d Stephens said.", "description": "Jeremy Stephens thinks Yair Rodriguez is trying to be someone that he's not and vows to teach him a hard lesson at UFC on ESPN 6.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Dan Tom", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan", "Simon Samano"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jeremy-stephens-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
