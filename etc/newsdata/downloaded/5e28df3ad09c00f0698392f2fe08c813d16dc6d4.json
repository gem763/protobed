Experts who study protest movements said activists are shifting toward more disruptive tactics that bring the issues they care about to the public in a more direct \u2014 and sometimes confrontational \u2014 way.\n\nAD\n\nThe boat was meant to symbolize the threat of sea-level rise to American cities and draw attention last month to an issue that organizers with Extinction Rebellion, one group responsible for organizing the demonstration, said has long been ignored or overlooked.\n\nAD\n\nIt was time, they said, for something more drastic.\n\n\u201cPeople have been holding permitted marches, calling members of Congress, sending elected officials letters and petitions, going to their offices, and so far, none of that has produced any change \u2014 and, in some cases, the problem has only gotten worse,\u201d said Nick Brana, an Extinction Rebellion D.C. spokesman. \u201cTraditional mechanisms of activism and making change in our society have failed us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt least four protests have taken over downtown Washington streets in the midst of commuter traffic in the past four weeks. Of those, only one \u2014 in which D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) marched with janitors amid union contract negotiations \u2014 had been granted a permit by D.C. police.\n\nWhen the 2017 Women\u2019s March converged on Washington, most women in the crowd said it was their first time participating in a protest, said Dana R. Fisher, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland who surveys participants and tracks protest trends. Most had never risked arrest or engaged in civil disobedience.\n\nAD\n\nBut at recent Youth Climate Strike events in the District, Fisher said, 53 percent of participants surveyed said they had participated in an act of civil disobedience in the past 12 months.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of discussion among people on the left who use protests as a tactic that peaceful, traditional protests may not be enough at this point,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThat could mean we see more people blocking traffic, causing a stir, going places without a permit. I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more people coming into D.C. to get arrested.\u201d\n\nAt the Shut Down DC demonstration on Sept. 23, protesters set up blockades at 15 intersections at different times throughout the morning, including 16th and K streets NW, where demonstrators chained themselves to that boat, three blocks from the White House. Police used power tools to sever activists\u2019 chains and eventually arrested 32 people \u2014 26 for blocking traffic elsewhere in the city and six others near the Capitol.\n\nAD\n\nSome commuters stuck in the snarl decided to give up and go home.\n\nAD\n\nLater that week, the same group of environmental activists rallied again during the morning commute. The group blocked several streets over the course of about two hours \u2014 ending with a dance party in the middle of 13th and K streets NW.\n\nThe demonstrations coincided with climate change protests in 150 countries pegged to the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.\n\nCommuters and pedestrians pulled out their phones to take photos and videos. Stuck in cars or buses held up by the rally, several commuters shrugged off the delay, saying they supported the group\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cOne thing to consider with protests is who is the intended audience? Who are the protesters trying to reach?\u201d said Jeremy Pressman, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut and co-founder of the Crowd Counting Consortium, which tracks protests. \u201cUnder President Trump, there have been a fair number of big-issue protests where lots of people got arrested. But most of the ones we\u2019ve seen were directed at lawmakers \u2014 people being arrested at the Capitol or inside federal buildings. And that\u2019s a different audience than when you\u2019re standing in traffic, messing up people\u2019s rush hour. You\u2019re taking your issue directly to the people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCausing a public disturbance can also be an effective tool in drawing media attention, Pressman said, particularly in a city such as the District, which has a large news media presence and where protests are common.\n\n\u201cWith all the activism we\u2019re seeing, people have to go back to the toolbox and think, \u2018How can we stand out?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nExtinction Rebellion D.C. demonstrators said they drew inspiration from activists in Europe, where environmental activists have staged die-ins, blockaded areas around government buildings, disrupted public transportation and super-glued themselves to structures.\n\nLast week, protesters in London clambered to the top of a commuter train in the London Underground and unfurled a banner reading, \u201cBusiness as Usual = Death,\u201d holding up the train and countless commuters during rush hour. Eventually, commuters on the packed platform dragged the activists down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProtest organizers have imported similarly provocative tactics to other American cities: Earlier this month, protesters held a die-in \u2014 complete with fake blood and signs pronouncing causes of death related to climate change \u2014 outside the New York Stock Exchange. About 90 people were arrested.\n\nWashington-based organizers said they have been studying these demonstrations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a beautiful diversity of actions,\u201d Brana said. \u201cThese are all things that we\u2019re learning from and that we\u2019re looking to bring over here. They\u2019re really jarring.\u201d\n\nOf course, theatrical protests and civil disobedience are far from new. Activists have been using similar methods to get their point across for decades.\n\nAD\n\nActivists with Black Lives Matter routinely took over bridges and blocked highways around the country in recent years to bring attention to the deaths of African Americans shot by police officers.\n\nAD\n\nEnvironmental activists credit the civil rights movement in the United States, the push for women\u2019s suffrage, the protest of apartheid in South Africa and the movement for independence in India as inspiration for their work.\n\nAbout 750 First Amendment demonstrations apply for a permit with the National Park Service annually, according to the agency\u2019s records.\n\nPolice want demonstrations that will close streets to also get a permit from the city, although unpermitted ones are common, and D.C. police spokeswoman Alaina Gertz said the agency typically allows unpermitted protests to proceed, \u201cas long as there is no danger or crime being committed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPolice declined to comment specifically about the agency\u2019s tactics in dealing with Shut Down DC and other disruptive demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWhen activists don\u2019t feel like their grievances are being heard or responded to in a meaningful way, the natural progression is to get more confrontational and, sometimes, to get more violent,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI\u2019m actually surprised it\u2019s taken so long.\u201d", "description": "At least four demonstrations have taken over downtown streets during the past four weeks, in what experts call a trend of more disruptive protests.", "authors": ["Marissa J.
