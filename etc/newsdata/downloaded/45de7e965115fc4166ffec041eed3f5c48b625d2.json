Regan was in charge of the pitchers. Manuel handled the hitters. At the time, the average age of a pitching or hitting coach in Major League Baseball was under 50-years-old. Regan and Manuel were 62 and 55, respectively, making them old for their jobs by any measurable standard.\n\nNow two decades have passed and the sport has only gotten younger, from the players to the managers to the executives. Yet when the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies found themselves on the verge of collapse this summer and in the position to hire any young hotshot on the market, they took a different approach. They brought back Regan, now 82, and Manuel, who is 75\u2014even though they are old enough to be the grandfathers of almost every player on the roster.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the crazy part: The Mets and Phillies surged after their arrival, helping both teams stay in the thick of the playoff race.\n\n\u201cAge doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Mets closer Seth Lugo said. \u201cI\u2019m close with my grandpa.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What can older coaches do to related to today\u2019s younger players? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe qualifications for major-league coaches have changed dramatically in recent years, with the rise of data and technology-based instruction ushering in a new breed of candidates. Seven first-time hitting and pitching coaches hired this past off-season never even played in the minors, their statistical and kinesthetic expertise outweighing their lack of experience.\n\nRegan and Manuel are the exact opposite. They might still be relatively new to the latest gadgets and metrics\u2014but what they do have is knowledge and skills acquired through full careers as players and teachers, characteristics that have been devalued.\n\nRegan, a grandfather of 18, pitched in the majors against Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle. His manager with the 1960 Detroit Tigers, Jimmy Dykes, was born in 1896. He got his first pitching coach gig with the Seattle Mariners at age 47, and he says he felt on the older side then. That was 35 years ago.\n\nManuel, 75, made his big-league debut in April 1969. Like Regan, it has been 20 years since Manuel had served as a coach in the majors, but he says not much has changed: He still often refers to Williams\u2019s book, \u201cThe Science of Hitting,\u201d of which he owns around a dozen copies.\n\n\u201cExperience definitely counts in this game,\u201d Manuel said.\n\nRegan and Manuel have plenty of that, and it\u2019s hard to argue with the results.\n\nWhen the Mets fired pitching coach Dave Eiland on June 20, their vaunted staff had a collective ERA of 4.67, 20th in the majors and third-to-last in the National League. The team was below .500 and, at best, on the fringe of the wild-card chase.\n\nThe announcement that Regan would replace Eiland immediately inspired curious headlines and plenty of talk-radio snark. Regan said that when he arrived, he told the Mets, \u201cI think I need No. 82 on my back, because every article I read said, \u2018Phil Regan, 82, named pitching coach.\u2019\u201d (He wound up going with No. 58.)\n\nThe jokes have stopped. The Mets entered Tuesday with a 3.95 ERA under Regan, sixth-best in baseball over that span.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s instant credibility when you talk about Phil Regan,\u201d said Mickey Callaway, the Mets\u2019 44-year-old manager. \u201cHe\u2019s done everything in the game.\u201d\n\nNew York Mets pitching coach Phil Regan jogs back to the dugout.

Before that, he led the Phillies to a World Series championship as their manager in 2008. When Manuel started as hitting coach, the Phillies ranked 18th in baseball in runs per game and had slipped into fourth place in the division.\n\nThey entered Tuesday ranked fifth in the majors in runs per game during Manuel\u2019s tenure. Both the Mets and Phillies have seen their production improve after a coaching change, vaulting them into wild-card contention with less than a month remaining in the regular season. It has caught the attention of the industry, which has perhaps underestimated the significance of experience.\n\n\u201cBaseball\u2019s still the same,\u201d Regan said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change. You just have more tools.\u201d\n\nThe biggest question surrounding Regan and Manuel was how they would adjust to coaching in a paradigm dominated by analytics after spending a lifetime in baseball without them.\n\nRegan has dedicated himself to understanding the modern thinking ever since he returned to the Mets\u2019 organization as a minor-league coach in 2009. He recognizes that many of his peers dismiss analytics, but he knows that if he hadn\u2019t stayed current, his baseball career would\u2019ve ended years ago. It\u2019s for that reason, Mets reliever Luis Avil\u00e1n said, \u201cWhenever I talk to him, I\u2019m not thinking, \u2018Come on, this guy is so old.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cThe computer age is here and has been here for a while, so you might as well learn it,\u201d Regan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep learning.\u201d\n\nManuel says he, too, has bulked up his knowledge of how coaches use technology to help hitters, though he doesn\u2019t consider himself an expert. His biggest strength, players say, is how he helps them navigate the mental challenges of baseball\u2014perhaps the most important job of any hitting or pitching coach.\n\nThat\u2019s one area where Manuel believes younger, inexperienced coaches struggle. While he has no doubt of their ability to teach swing mechanics, they haven\u2019t necessarily helped hitters mired in a dreadful slump regain their confidence or deal with the pressure of hitting in crucial September games.\n\n\u201cThe hardest situation you\u2019ll ever see in baseball, he has already seen it,\u201d Phillies shortstop Jean Segura said of Manuel. \u201cAnd he already got it done.\u201d\n\nTo build a rapport with players more than 50 years their junior, Regan and Manuel have taken to talking to players about the past, regaling them with stories of Williams and Harmon Killebrew and Carl Yastrzemski. Regan recently had an in-depth conversation with pitchers about the reserve clause, the creation of free agency and the early days of the players\u2019 union.\n\nIt seems unlikely either coach will return to his post in 2020. Their teams will probably seek long-term solutions. But Regan and Manuel have done enough to force other teams to consider having an old-timer on their staff moving forward. At the very least, maybe they won\u2019t snicker the next time somebody like Regan or Manuel comes along.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t respect their elders like they used to,\u201d Lugo said. \u201cI think that says a lot.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "description": "Charlie Manuel, age 75, and Phil Regan, age 82, drew snickers when they were hired, but have proven that experience can be a valuable asset.", "authors": ["Jared Diamond"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103368/social"}
