As the firestorm of outrage grew, 19-year-old American University student Casey Chambers woke up wondering what his own team could do.\n\nChambers wasn\u2019t happy with Blizzard\u2019s response to ban \u201cHearthstone\u201d pro player Ng \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Wai Chung and take away both his previously won prize money and cut off a source of his income via the ban. Chambers was similarly dismayed that the two casters who claimed ignorance of the statements were fired by Blizzard.\n\nChambers was going to meet his team at their scheduled 2 p.m. practice before their game against Worcester Polytechnic Institute during the American Collegiate Hearthstone Championship. He wondered what his teammates thought of making a statement.\n\n\u201cWe all had the same idea,\u201d teammate Corwin Dark, 19, told The Washington Post from Chambers\u2019s dorm room. \u201cNone of us wanted to push it on the others. We were all just feeling like Blizzard betrayed us. We care about the company and the game, and wanted to do something.\u201d\n\nWhen the AU students lost, they saw their moment: They held up a sign that read, \u201cFree Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz.\" The Twitch stream, which was operated by Blizzard, immediately cut away to the winners, and the casters ignored what happened. Winner interviews ended for the night. And the cameras showing the players were turned off, replaced by characters from the game.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to keep the pressure on them,\u201d Dark said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to censor that message, use those same rules to an American audience and see how that goes.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong protests have been a common rallying point for social activists in recent months. A proposal by Hong Kong to allow extraditions to China sparked the movement, as it was seen by some as an attempt by Beijing to pick apart the autonomy and liberties promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.\n\n[The evolution of Hong Kong's protests]\n\nThe NBA is also dealing with political fallout from a Houston Rockets executive\u2019s tweet in support of the protesters. All of this is set against President Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with China and its economic fallout.\n\nBlizzard has invested in China\u2019s esports scene through its Overwatch League, placing franchises in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Chengdu. Tencent, a Chinese entertainment giant, owns a 5 percent stake in Blizzard\u2019s parent company, Activision Blizzard, and serves as the NBA\u2019s rights holder in China.\n\nActivision Blizzard is also seeking Chinese approvals for its \u201cCall of Duty Mobile\u201d game, according to the Wall Street Journal. That game saw a record-breaking 100 million downloads in its first week. Releasing it in China, where mobile gaming is a larger phenomenon, would reap even more financial rewards for the largest gaming company of the West.\n\nBlizzCon, Blizzard\u2019s annual gathering for fans and the setting for numerous high-profile company announcements, looms at the beginning of November. Last year, Blizzard faced huge backlash over announcing the next game in the legendary Diablo franchise was going to be a mobile-only game, co-created by NetEase, a China-based studio.\n\nOn the Hearthstone subreddit, many of its users are expecting more outrage. As one comment predicted, \u201cY\u2019all just KNOW BlizzCon will be nothing but Hong Kong signs.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the AU Hearthstone team had not heard from Activision Blizzard or Tespa, the collegiate esports organization partnered with Blizzard that operates the Hearthstone events.\n\nThe student protest was just one of a few public displays of dismay toward the company since Blizzard\u2019s actions. Respected pro card player and streamer Brian Kibler announced he will not be casting the Grandmasters finals at Blizzard\u2019s annual BlizzCon event.\n\n\u201cI will not be a smiling face on camera that tacitly endorses this decision,\u201d Kibler said in a blog post, calling the punishments unwarranted and unfair. \u201cUnless something changes, I will have no involvement in Grandmasters moving forward.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on Kibler\u2019s Twitch stream Wednesday, he said the decision to take a stand didn\u2019t come lightly and that he could \u201crealistically never work with Hearthstone again.\u201d\n\nHe also added that other members of the Hearthstone community support his stand but also don\u2019t feel they could comment publicly. Kibler said he was willing to risk the blowback but can respect others for not speaking out due to other circumstances. Kibler is a pro \u201cMagic: The Gathering\u201d player and has worked as a designer for similar trading card games.\n\nMeanwhile, Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch character Mei has been quickly adopted on the Internet as a symbol of Hong Kong resistance.\n\nActivision Blizzard has not responded to multiple requests comment as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI think they thought it was just going to be a quiet response and a little bit of anger,\u201d Chambers said of Blizzard. \u201cHonestly we thought it was the best-case scenario that we were going to get Twitch chat to go crazy during the match.\u201d\n\nThe Twitch stream\u2019s chat for the AU match indeed went wild, exploding with pasted comments of \u201cSPAM THIS PONG TO FREE HONG KONG.\"\n\nChambers said the team wants to remind people that Blitzchung risked far more than he and his teammates did to make a point.\n\n\u201cHe risked real things,\u201d Chambers said. \u201cWe risked getting banned from a tournament structure we don\u2019t intend to compete in anymore. He lost his permanent Grandmasters spot, which is a money printer. He risked getting arrested by security services in Hong Kong. He actually is the hero here.\"\n\nAU Game Lab director and professor Andrew Phelps is also president of the Higher Education Video Game Alliance, which works with many education gaming and esports programs across the nation. He said Blizzard\u2019s actions are a flash point for the group\u2019s long-standing debate and research around the role of private game companies.\n\n\u201cBlizzard really stepped in it in a profound way, and are really facing some backlash,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cIt highlights this ongoing tension between values and corporate practice, and the ways they intersect around technology platforms.\u201d\n\nFor now, Dark said he doesn\u2019t plan on supporting Blizzard.\n\n\u201cJust the idea that Blizzard would use the money and tournaments we support actively for this,\u201d Dark said. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear signal they were trying to send to certain authorities.\u201d", "description": "In an effort to highlight Blizzard's censorship of a Hong Kong athlete, American University students kept up the pressure by holding up a sign during a recent collegiate esports match.", "authors": ["Gene Park", "October At Pm", "Gene Park Is A Reporter For The Washington Post", "Covering Video Games", "Gaming Culture.
