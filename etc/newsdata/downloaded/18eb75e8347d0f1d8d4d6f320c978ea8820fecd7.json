Jason Saine.

On Wednesday, the House GOP used Democrats\u2019 commemorative absence as an opportunity to pass a vote overriding Democratic Governor Roy Cooper\u2019s veto of the state\u2019s two-year budget.\n\nAccording to a schedule produced by Democratic minority leader Darren Jackson, there were no votes on the docket until the afternoon, and at 8:30 a.m., Dems were reportedly told it would be an empty morning. But shortly before 9 a.m., Republican Jason Saine pulled a switcheroo, making the motion to review the budget. With just enough members present to hold a vote, GOP lawmakers passed the veto override, 55 to 9. Describing their opportunity, Saine said that House Speaker Tim Moore \u201cmade the promise early on in the budgeting process that anytime we saw an opportunity to override the veto we would do so.\u201d Concerns that he was taking the Republican speaker\u2019s words too seriously were expelled when Moore told the local CBS affiliate: \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for North Carolina.\u201d\n\nDemocrats disagreed. Shortly after the vote, Democratic state Senator Jeff Jackson called the effort \u201cplainly unethical.\u201d Representative Deb Butler, one of the few Democrats was present for the vote, condemned Speaker Moore before it was cast, shouting: \u201cThis is a travesty of the process and you know it.\u201d Moore reportedly threatened Butler with arrest in order to stop her objections, before fellow Democrats surrounded her to prevent her removal.\n\nIn terms of wielding power without regard to ethics or consequence, North Carolina House Republicans don\u2019t have the creativity points of their counterparts in Oregon, where in June, GOP lawmakers fled the state in order to halt progress on a climate bill that would create a cap-and-trade solution for carbon emissions. But what the Carolinians lack in creativity, they make up for in their willingness to use a national tragedy to pursue political interests. As New York\u2019s Jonathan Chait and Zak Cheney-Rice noted today, the Republican Party often uses September 11 as a \u201cnationalist totem\u201d and to \u201caccuse its opponents of being insufficiently patriotic.\u201d But rarely do they employ the tragedy in politics as directly, and as transactionally, as in North Carolina.", "description": "On the 18th anniversary of 9/11, as their Democratic counterparts attended memorial, Republican House lawmakers used the Dem absence to pass a \u2018surprise vote\u2019 overriding Democratic Governor Roy Cooper\u2019s veto of the state\u2019s two-year budget.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/11/11-jason-saine-nc.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
