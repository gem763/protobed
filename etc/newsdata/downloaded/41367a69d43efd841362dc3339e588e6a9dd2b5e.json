You\u2019ve got to make sure you have cover that\u2019s immediate even though you can replace players because there is obviously a big time delay in that.\u201d\n\nSchmidt has settled on five props, with two looseheads in the form of Cian Healy and Dave Kilcoyne joined by tightheads Tadhg Furlong, Andrew Porter and John Ryan, while captain Best is named with Sean Cronin and Niall Scannell as hookers.\n\nAdding to the four second-row options are back-rows Jack Conan, Peter O\u2019Mahony, Rhys Ruddock, CJ Stander and Josh van der Flier, although both Henderson and Beirne are adept at playing in the back-row.\n\nSchmidt will take just two scrum-halves in Conor Murray and Luke McGrath after dropping John Cooney a handful of weeks ago and leaving out Kieran Marmion, meaning five half-backs are included in total, while Bundee Aki, Robbie Henshaw, Farrell and Garry Ringrose make up the centre options.\n\nAndrew Conway, Keith Earls, Rob Kearney, Jordan Larmour and Jacob Stockdale make up the back-three options, though Carbery is able to cover at full-back once he recovers from a lingering ankle injury.\n\nIreland depart for Japan on Wednesday 11 September ahead of their opening pool stage fixture against Scotland on the opening weekend of the tournament.\n\nIreland's final World Cup squad\n\nForwards\n\nRory Best (Ulster) 119 caps\n\nTadhg Beirne (Munster) 8 caps\n\nJack Conan (Leinster) 15 caps\n\nSean Cronin (Leinster) 69 caps\n\nTadhg Furlong (Leinster) 35 caps\n\nCian Healy (Leinster) 90 caps\n\nDave Kilcoyne (Munster) 30 caps\n\nIain Henderson (Ulster) 47 caps\n\nJean Kleyn (Munster) 2 caps\n\nPeter O\u2019Mahony (Munster) 59 caps\n\nAndrew Porter (Leinster) 17 caps\n\nRhys Ruddock (Leinster) 22 caps\n\nJames Ryan (Leinster) 18 caps\n\nJohn Ryan (Munster) 20 caps\n\nNiall Scannell (Munster) 16 caps\n\nCJ Stander (Munster) 32 caps\n\nJosh van der Flier (Leinster) 18 caps\n\nBacks\n\nBundee Aki (Connacht) 19 caps\n\nJoey Carbery (Munster) 19 caps\n\nJack Carty (Connacht) 6 caps\n\nAndrew Conway (Munster) 15 caps\n\nKeith Earls (Munster) 77 caps\n\nChris Farrell (Munster) 5 caps\n\nRobbie Henshaw (Leinster) 37 caps\n\nRob Kearney (Leinster) 91 caps\n\nJordan Larmour (Leinster) 15 caps\n\nLuke McGrath (Leinster) 13 caps\n\nConor Murray (Munster) 73 caps\n\nGarry Ringrose (Leinster) 23 caps\n\nJonathan Sexton (Leinster) 83 caps\n\nJacob Stockdale (Ulster) 20 caps\n\nMore follows\u2026", "description": "Joe Schmidt has dropped veteran lock Devin Toner from his Ireland\u00a0Rugby World Cup squad after deciding to make the final 31-man team announcement six days early.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/13/devin-toner.jpg"}
