The racist and xenophobic comments King has made in recent years have made him a pariah among Republicans and Democrats alike. Yet since 2003, the Iowa lawmaker continues to be reelected\u2014a phenomenon that has perplexed many Americans and members of the political class. The left unfairly and erroneously targets King and his supporters, Leonard said, because it doesn\u2019t know who they really are.\n\nWhen King won his most recent reelection campaign, I reported that some Iowans backed him despite his racist remarks, that they were willing to look past them because of King's conservative positions on guns and abortion. But as became clear during my recent trip to northwest Iowa, many of his voters wholeheartedly agree with him\u2014and they don\u2019t think he\u2019s said anything wrong.\n\nWhen I asked Leonard about King\u2019s 2017 claim that \u201cwe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies , \u201d he said he felt the same way. \u201cIf we bring people from another culture here and overpopulate this place with people from a different culture, we won\u2019t build up American culture,\u201d Leonard said, a claim I heard from others in the district as well. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t going to have an appreciation for what these folks on my walls went through,\u201d he added, gesturing to his Confederate paintings. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing racist about it. It\u2019s a truth.\u201d\n\nKing is facing a difficult primary next year\u2014probably the toughest he's ever had. He's lost support from the GOP establishment, he\u2019s low on money, and he\u2019s facing multiple Republican challengers. But his remaining supporters seem more devoted to him than ever as he\u2019s under siege.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the \u2018Live free or die\u2019 mentality,\u201d said Art Cullen, the editor of a local newspaper, who has written column after column condemning King\u2019s comments. \u201cWe get ignored by Des Moines, we get flown over, and nobody pays attention to us. The manifestation of that is Screw you, here\u2019s Steve King.\u201d\n\nGeographically, at least, King\u2019s district, where I lived for four years, is quintessential Iowa: rolling fields and wind turbines and sky stretching on for miles. Here, you can see a storm approaching long before it hits. The region is extremely red; its residents, who are predominantly Christian and socially conservative, voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016. King has won each of his reelections here by sizable margins\u2014although last year\u2019s contest was his closest yet: J. D. Scholten, the Democrat who ran as a foil to King\u2019s abrasiveness, lost to him by a slim 3 percent.\n\nIowa has seen an influx of Latino immigrants in the past two decades. The Latino population in the mostly white state grew by more than 130 percent from 2000 to 2017. Storm Lake\u2014King\u2019s birthplace in the district\u2014has become one of the most diverse towns in the state. Nearly 38 percent of the town\u2019s population identifies as Latino, and some 83 percent of children in the school district are students of color.", "description": "The Iowa Republican\u2019s racist comments have made him a pariah among Democrats and Republicans alike.
