Pictured here is Barron Hilton (right) with his granddaughter Paris at Dan Tanas on April 14, 2010 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nText size\n\nHotelier and philanthropist Barron Hilton has left 97% of his fortune to his family foundation, which will help strengthen its seven charitable programs across the world, focused on disaster relief and recovery, treating children with HIV and AIDS, poverty alleviation, and more.\n\nHilton died in Los Angeles on Sept. 19 at age 91, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation announced in a release last Friday.\n\nHe had an estimated net worth of $2.3 billion in 2007, when he pledged his donation, according to Forbes. But the family foundation said the planned gift is projected to increase its endowment from $2.9 billion to $6.3 billion, which means his donation is close to $3.4 billion.\n\n\u201cMy father was a loving husband to our mother, Marilyn, a wonderful role model to his eight children, a loyal and generous friend, visionary businessman, respected leader, and a passionate sportsman,\u201d Steven M. Hilton, Barron\u2019s son and chairman of the Hilton Foundation\u2019s board, said in a statement.\n\nBarron Hilton succeeded his father Conrad Hilton, as chairman, president, and chief executive of Hilton Hotels Corporation in 1966. He retired in 1996. He also founded the L.A. Chargers NFL team, and Carte Blanche, a credit card company.\n\nAfter Hilton Hotels Corporation and Harrah\u2019s Entertainment, the successor gaming corporation to Hilton\u2019s gaming operations, were purchased by two private equity firms in 2006 and 2007, Hilton pledged that he, like his father, would leave 97% of his wealth to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.\n\nThe remaining 3% of his wealth will go to his family members, including eight children, 15 grandchildren, including socialite granddaughters Paris and Nicky, and four great-grandchildren.\n\nIn May 2018, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation announced that it would transition out four programs, primarily in the health field. Currently, its seven programs focus on disaster relief and recovery, youth development, treating children with HIV and AIDS, poverty alleviation, supporting homeless shelters, and more.", "description": "The foundation\u2019s endowment will increase by $3.4 billion", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110057/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
