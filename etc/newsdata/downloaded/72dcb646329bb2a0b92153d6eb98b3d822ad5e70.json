Both were closed last night.\n\nEye-witnesses described seeing the woman \u201cfly off\u201d the ride, and paramedics were seen treating her before she was quickly taken to hospital.\n\n(Image: Hull Live/MEN MEDIA)\n\n(Image: Stephen Gleno / SWNS)\n\nOne witnesss told Hull Live: \u201cThe bar failed and a girl just came flying off it while it was in motion. It\u2019s at the back in the corner near West Park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been shut and the emergency services are there. There is a lot of blood. It doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d\n\nThe woman's injuries have been assessed as serious but not life-threatening, according to Humberside Police.\n\nOne man said: \u201cWe were on the way out as this happened and saw medics running by but assumed someone maybe collapsed.\n\n\"It's shocking. I\u2019m sending my best wishes to the lady.\u201d\n\nAmy Louise Jackson, 25, did not see what happened but turned up to go on the ride. She said: \"It's scary. That's one of the rides I normally go on that one.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear stories like this, I won't go on them again. It puts you off. It makes you think twice about health and safety.\u201d\n\n(Image: Stephen Gleno / SWNS)\n\nAnother witness said: \"I was nearby but I didn't see it happen, I was standing on the other side.\n\n\"I just heard a shout and then the ride was quickly shut down.\"\n\nOne woman pushing a pram through the fair said: \"It's scary. It is not like this it is the first time it has happened.\"\n\nIt has since emerged the Airmaxx 360 is believed to be the same model involved in a fatal accident in 2014 which killed eight-year-old Adelene Leong in Adelaide five years ago.\n\nAdelene, who was on holiday from her native Malaysia was thrown ten metres from her seat in 2014.\n\n(Image: SA Police)\n\nChief Inspector Paul Kirby, tactical commander for Hull Fair, said: \"A woman has sadly been seriously injured Hull Fair and taken to hospital by ambulance.\n\n\"We do not believe her injuries are life threatening or life changing.\n\n\"A teenage boy was struck by the woman as she fell. He thankfully only sustained minor injuries.\n\n\"We have very well established plans in place with the council for any incident like this at the fair, and I want to thank everyone for their patience while we deal with this.\n\n\"I am appealing for anyone who might have seen what happened, or who has any video footage of it to contact us.\"", "description": "The woman had been on the Airmaxx 360 which has been shut down by officials at Hull Fair", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Hull Live Men Media", "Stephen Gleno", "Swns", "Sa Police"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535165.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_hull-fair-ride-closed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
