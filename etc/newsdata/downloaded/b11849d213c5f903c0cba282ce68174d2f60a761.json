That is the kind of money it would take most people years to save.\n\nHigh stamp duty also impedes the economy, as it is a drag on transactions and discourages people from moving for work, plus it encourages them to borrow more on mortgages, as the tax bill ate some of their deposit.\n\nIt is high time it is reformed, but the reform needs to be better than the last one.\n\nThe chart from the Greater London Authority's recent Housing in London report shows how Londoners have been tapped up for an increasing share of Britain's stamp duty bills - and also by how much that bill has soared since 1997\n\nGeorge Osborne\u2019s shift from the old slab-style stamp duty, which imposed higher tax rates above thresholds on the entire price, to a progressive income tax-style system, with higher rates only levelled above the thresholds, was sensible.\n\nThe previous system had been used to milk rising house prices and created the cliff edge scenarios, such as that at the 3 per cent level at \u00a3250,000, where tax jumped from \u00a32,500 to \u00a37,500.\n\nHow much would stamp duty cost you?
