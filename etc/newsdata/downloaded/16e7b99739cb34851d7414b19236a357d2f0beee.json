(AP) - Anthony Lynn is starting to pencil in at least one game a year where the Los Angeles Chargers fail to capitalize on opportunities and gift-wrap a victory to the opponent.\n\nThe third-year coach is hoping Sunday\u2019s 13-10 loss at Detroit is the only time that happens this season.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason these types of games show up once a year. I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Lynn said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re a smart football team. That doesn\u2019t happen a lot so it blindsides you when it happens. We normally don\u2019t beat ourselves.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to excruciating defeats when a team messes up multiple times, this one was textbook. Los Angeles had two touchdowns called back due to penalties and then fumbled near the goal line in the same drive. It missed two field goals and saw hopes of sending the game into overtime go for naught when Philip Rivers was intercepted in the end zone.\n\nNow Lynn has to get his team to put this loss behind while dealing with a mounting list of injuries. The Chargers had six starters not play against the Lions. The list will grow by at least one this week with safety Adrian Phillips out due to a broken forearm.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe run defense looked more like last season\u2019s. The Chargers yielded just 94 yards to the Lions on the ground after giving up 203 in the opener to Indianapolis.\n\nLos Angeles surrendered just one run over 10 yards and none over 20 after allowing five over 10 yards last week, including two over 20.\n\n\u201cWe were much better. We knew they were going to pound it and we held them to 3.4 (yards per carry), which is good,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cThe defensive line played well. Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram made extra efforts to make plays in the run game.\u201d\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nAustin Ekeler is averaging 4.3 yards per carry and has two rushing touchdowns, but he needs to do a better job with ball security near the goal line.\n\nHis fumble at the Lions 1 was his second of the season, including the preseason, in a goal-to-go situation.\n\n\u201cHe is a heck of a football player but you don\u2019t want to see patterns,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cThe only thing I would fault (on Sunday\u2019s carry) is going over the top on first-and-goal. When you go over top you expose the football.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nCornerback Casey Hayward was one of four players to go all 61 snaps on defense. His interception of Matthew Stafford\u2019s pass intended for Kenny Golladay was Stafford\u2019s first pick in 162 attempts.\n\nHayward has 12 interceptions since joining the Chargers in 2016. That is the fourth in the league over the past three-plus seasons.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nTy Long was pressed into double duty again on Sunday due to kicker Michael Badgley\u2019s groin jury and missed two field goals. He had a 39-yard attempt hit the left upright during the third quarter and was wide right from 41 yards in the fourth.\n\nLynn said Badgley continues to make progress but wasn\u2019t sure if he would be ready for Sunday\u2019s game against Houston.\n\nINJURED\n\nPhillips will be out for a significant period of time due to a broken right forearm which he suffered during the fourth quarter. Lynn said Phillips would be placed on injured reserve in hopes he could possibly return sometime later this season.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n4 - Penalties by the offense on one drive, which ended in Ekeler\u2019s fumble. Justin Jackson\u2019s 60-yard touchdown was nullified by a holding penalty on wide receiver Dontrelle Inman, and a 22-yard Ekeler reception for a score was wiped away by Sam Tevi being flagged for an illegal block.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Chargers are 1-1 for the second straight season going into Sunday\u2019s home game against Houston. There are no signs of Melvin Gordon ending his holdout soon. The biggest adjustment on defense will be seeing who will replace Phillips at strong safety, with Rayshawn Jenkins and Jaylen Watkins being the most likely.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Anthony Lynn is starting to pencil in at least one game a year where the Los Angeles Chargers fail to capitalize on opportunities and gift-wrap a victory to the opponent.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/chargers_lions_football_76310_c0-169-4039-2523_s1770x1032.jpg?eda9f9f007f265954459a8a88cac0270247d33f6", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
