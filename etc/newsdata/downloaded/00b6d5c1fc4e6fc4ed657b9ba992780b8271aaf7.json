Mr King gave the money to the charity after unexpectedly raising millions after being spotted 'begging' for beer money at a sports broadcast late last month\n\nSam's Halloween campaign, which is becoming a viral sensation in its own right, has the exact same distinct hallmarks as his idol.\n\nThe boy can be seen in his mother Cindy Sobaski Hall's Facebook post wearing an Iowa State University Cyclone hoodie and cap, and holding a sign - just like Carson King did in the background of the ESPN College GameDay broadcast.\n\n'Root beer supply needs replenished,' read Sam's sign.\n\nIn another photo depicting the back of his sign, Sam has written instead of candy he wants donations for the same hospital Mr King donated to.\n\nOn the post, his mother wrote that Sam had decided on his Halloween costume weeks ago and has not wavered once.\n\n'His uncle talked me into opening a Venmo account so he can donate money to the U of I Children's Hospital. Just like Carson,' she wrote.\n\nSam's mother Cindy Sobaski Hall has been sharing her son's progress publicly on her Facebook page, giving regular updates on his fundraising goal\n\nIn subsequent post Sam can be seen side-by-side with his Halloween role model - Mr King.\n\n'Sam had a pretty exciting day. He reached $9000 #ForTheKids, and Carson King stopped by with root beer and candy! Carson is truly #IowaNice,' Ms Hall wrote.\n\n'The Venmo account (Sam-Hall-85) will be open through Halloween to raise money for the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital. Spread the word and donate to help Sam reach $10,000 and beyond!'\n\nOn Mr King's own Facebook page he has shared his praises of the young boy's charitable efforts.\n\n'Sam is a Superhero,' the 24-year-old casino worker wrote. 'I'll say it once and I'll say it again, Sam is the Man.\n\n'I had to make sure he got his fix of Rootbeer and Candy! He\u2019s at over $10,000 for The University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital #ForTheKids.'\n\nSam's Halloween campaign, which is becoming a viral sensation in its own right, bears the exact same distinct hallmarks as his idol as evident in these pictures his mother shared on her Facebook page\n\nMr King's own campaign, while ultimately successful, was not without some controversy.\n\nHis initial goal, the less charitable one of earning a few laughs and perhaps enough cash to spend on a few beers at the game, garnered world-wide attention after the image of him 'begging' for beer money went viral.\n\nHowever, after his account was flooded, Mr King decided to use this money for a more selfless purpose and decided to donate it to the local children's hospital.\n\nHis kind gesture was almost derailed when a local journalist uncovered two racist tweets the 24-year-old had posted when he was just a teen in 2011.\n\nHowever, after he gave a heartfelt apology in a televised statement, Mr King's fundraiser continued to rake in donations - topping $2.95 million when it closed.", "description": "Iowa boy Sam Hall is dressing up like the infamous football fan Carson King who went viral for soliciting beer money earlier this month.
