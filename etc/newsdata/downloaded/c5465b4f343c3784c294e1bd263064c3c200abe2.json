DNA tests confirmed that it was Lee's blood.\n\nDelport said the family would have preferred a harsher sentence for Mashinini.\n\n\"Five years for me is still not enough for defeating the ends of justice because he is continuing to defeat the ends justice as he will not reveal where Lee's remains are,\" she added.\n\nThe trial, which ran for several months, was \"extremely traumatic\" for the family, Delport said.\n\n\"Each day was difficult because you still wake up knowing that you will never, ever see Lee again.\n\n\"With Kaylah having to see him daily and not being able to get her son back - not being able to give a mother her own child back is the worst thing.\n\n\"Not one day was it a brilliant day, it was just a day of coping,\" Delport said of the trial.\n\nShe added the family was grateful for the invaluable support they received throughout the trial. \"It's made us stronger [and] realise our purpose - that we will not stop fighting for others like Lee.\"\n\nThe family has started a foundation to do exactly that, ensuring that other families also have support.\n\n\"I will ensure that we are the voice for the voiceless [and] that justice prevails for [Lee]. I will make sure that, for families out there in the same predicament, we are there with them every step of the way.\n\n\"It is the support that got us through this, without the support it would have been worse than it felt,\" Delport said.", "description": "The family of three-year-old Liyaqat \"Lee\" Mentoor, who was murdered last year, say they have mixed emotions after his killer was sentenced to life imprisonment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7236/0b9b3deefe0444a1babba5870956b82c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
