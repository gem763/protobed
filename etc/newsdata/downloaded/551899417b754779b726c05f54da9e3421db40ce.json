That policy was one of the tactics used by the administration as it tried to stop the flow of migrants across the US border.\n\nIn a press conference in the White House on Monday, acting CBP chief Mark Morgan said that the drop to 64,000 arrests on the southern border is a credit to Donald Trump's June agreement with Mexico on immigration, which saw the country deploying troops to the borders to try and help meet the US president's demands. Overall, the Trump administration has reported a 56 per cent decline since that deal was struck.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Overall, however, the August numbers were the highest the US has seen in a decade, and the overall arrest numbers are expected to top a million for the fiscal year ending 30 September \u2014 a rate not seen since the George W Bush administration.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Families belong together\u2019 protests over Trump immigration policy Show all 8 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.
