Her first book, \u201cHow to Lose the Information War,\u201d will be published next year.\n\nUkraine has been thrust into the news, but not for its two historic elections this year or progress made by its new comedian-turned-president. No, Ukraine is on America\u2019s mind because a whistleblower in the U.S. intelligence community alleged that President Trump pressured the new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, using nearly $400 million in military aid as leverage. A White House memorandum outlining the leaders\u2019 call shows Zelensky asking for more military aid, to which Trump responds, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d before turning to a possible investigation of his political enemies. As impeachment proceedings over the scandal begin, Ukraine \u2014 and misinformation about it \u2014 will continue to be a mainstay of the news.\n\nMyth No. 1\n\nIt's called 'the Ukraine.'\n\nMany Americans \u2014 including Trump and his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 regularly call Ukraine by an outdated name: \u201cthe Ukraine.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo also referred to it that way while interrogating Giuliani, opening a line of questioning by asking the former New York mayor, \u201cDid you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?\u201d\n\nIt is true that the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was commonly known as \u201cthe Ukraine\u201d in English, but even then, the term was a shorthand. The fraught definite article is rooted in a traditional translation choice that has geopolitical implications. In Russian, the word \u201cUkraina\u201d means \u201cborderlands\u201d and takes the preposition \u201cna.\u201d Using the phrase \u201cna Ukraini\u201d to describe the sovereign nation of Ukraine in Russian is derogatory, akin to saying \u201cin the sticks\u201d in English. It implies that Ukraine is not an independent state but simply a \u201cborderland\u201d on Russia\u2019s outskirts. Ukrainians (and Ukraine\u2019s Russian-speaking supporters elsewhere) use a different preposition when speaking about the country: \u201cv.\u201d The proper English translation of this preferred construction would be \u201cin Ukraine.\u201d But even if you ignore the linguistics, the country\u2019s official name is Ukraine. Leaders, journalists and pundits should use it.\n\nMyth No. 2\n\nCrimeans want to be\n\npart of Russia.\n\nIn 2014, just after the Sochi Winter Olympics, \u201clittle green men\u201d \u2014 military personnel without insignia on their green uniforms, later revealed to be Russian troops \u2014 rolled into Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and began wresting control of military installations and administrative resources from local authorities. A few weeks later, Russia organized an unconstitutional referendum to secure the peninsula\u2019s new affiliation. Moscow claimed that 97 percent of Crimean voters chose to be incorporated into the Russian Federation rather than maintain the peninsula\u2019s autonomous status within Ukraine. Later, during the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that \u201cthe people of Crimea, from what I\u2019ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,\u201d a claim he has repeated since assuming office.\n\nBut the reality of what Crimeans want is not so cut-and-dried. Both the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe condemned the March 2014 referendum as illegitimate. The Kremlin has restricted access to the peninsula since its annexation, making it difficult to assess people\u2019s true sentiments. It has also targeted independent media outlets and imprisoned at least 110 local journalists and activists for their work . Several leaders of the Crimean Tatar ethnic group, which considers the peninsula its ancestral home, are among them.\n\nThey are lucky to have their lives; other critics of the annexation have been kidnapped, disappeared or killed . A 2019 report from the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights found that Russia carries out \u201cpervasive human rights violations such as restrictions on freedoms of religion, opinion and expression and association, as well as the intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders, disproportionately affecting Crimean Tatars.\u201d Many residents have fled the peninsula since the annexation, contributing to the more than 1.4 million internally displaced people in Ukraine . In short, the Kremlin\u2019s argument that Crimeans \u201cwant to be part of Russia\u201d rests on an illegal sham election and the systematic oppression of dissent.\n\nMyth No. 3\n\nUkraine is fighting a civil war.\n\nThe war in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region that has been going on for more than five years and claimed more than 13,000 lives is a confusing one; Russia has purposely made it that way. In addition to its stealthy and illegal annexation of Crimea, the Kremlin secretly funds, outfits and supplies troops to separatists in Eastern Ukraine, so calling the conflict a \u201ccivil war\u201d \u2014 as Russian-owned British newspaper the Independent has done since the fighting broke out \u2014 is incorrect. Global Security Review has similarly described the situation as a \u201ccivil war,\u201d claiming that it will \u201cremain frozen for the foreseeable future,\u201d and the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently complained after a Hungarian official used the term.\n\nNot only has the Russian government sent its soldiers to fight in Ukraine, as a 2015 investigation by journalist Simon Ostrovsky revealed , but a Russian missile launcher brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014, killing all 298 aboard. An international probe of the disaster established Moscow\u2019s direct military command over the separatists, suggesting that Moscow\u2019s role in directing and shaping the conflict is much greater than the Kremlin admits. The Donbas war was started and is perpetuated \u2014 through funding, heavy weaponry, supplies and troops \u2014 by Russia. It is not a civil war.\n\nMyth No. 4\n\nUkraine is hopelessly corrupt.\n\n\u201cWhy would you give money to a country you think is corrupt?\u201d Trump recently responded when questioned about his administration\u2019s decision to delay almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. As vice president, Biden told the Ukrainian parliament in 2015, \u201cYou cannot name me a single democracy in the world where the cancer of corruption is [more] prevalent\u201d than in Ukraine.\n\nFour years later, corruption remains Ukraine\u2019s greatest reform challenge. But the government has also made important progress. It has implemented an online procurement system for government tenders. It has established an online wealth declaration system for all public officials, including the president and prime minister, that is fully transparent and accessible to the public. Ukraine\u2019s new parliament voted to strip its members of immunity , which had long protected lawmakers from prosecution for crimes including corruption. And just this past week, Zelensky signed a new law clarifying that the president of Ukraine can, in fact, be impeached . Ukraine still has a long way to go \u2014 its court system, in particular, requires serious reform \u2014 but the progress since the rejection of the corrupt Yanukovych regime in 2014 is unmistakable.\n\nMyth No. 5\n\nJoe Biden lobbied to fire a prosecutor on behalf of his son.\n\nTrump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Giuliani have all alleged, without evidence, that as vice president, Biden threatened to withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee Ukraine if then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko did not fire a prosecutor investigating corruption in gas company Burisma. President Trump alleges that Biden did this to protect Hunter Biden, the vice president\u2019s son, who sat on the company\u2019s board. According to a White House memo recounting Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky, Trump told him, \u201cI heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that\u2019s really unfair.\u201d Trump goes on to say that Biden \u201cstopped the prosecution.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Shokin, who had a long record of incompetence, was an impediment to anti-corruption work in Ukraine. The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in 2015, Geoffrey Pyatt, lambasted Shokin for his office\u2019s role in getting a British investigation into Burisma dismissed. Anti-corruption activists in Ukraine regularly protested Shokin\u2019s behavior . And, along with an international coalition including the European Union that pushed for further anti-corruption reform in Ukraine, Biden lobbied Poroshenko for Shokin\u2019s firing, while also insisting on other anti-corruption reforms the country needed to pursue to continue receiving U.S. aid. Finally, according to Ukrainian officials and anti-corruption activists, the investigation into Burisma had been shelved long before Biden made his request. By lobbying for Shokin\u2019s dismissal, Biden invited more scrutiny of his son, not less. He was pressuring Ukraine to crack down on corruption, not contributing to it.\n\nFive myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.
