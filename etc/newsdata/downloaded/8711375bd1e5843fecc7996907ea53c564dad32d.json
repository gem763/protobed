But thousands of people regrouped and marched along a main thoroughfare toward government offices, crippling traffic.\n\n\u201cSo many youngsters feel that they\u2019re going to have no future because of the power of China,\u201d Andy Yeung, 40, said as he pushed his toddler in a stroller. \u201cIt\u2019s hopeless for Hong Kong. If we don\u2019t stand up, there will be no hope.\u201d\n\nProtesters, many clad in black with umbrellas and carrying pro-democracy posters and foreign flags, sang songs and chanted \u201cStand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom.\u201d Some defaced, tore down and burned National Day congratulatory signages, setting off a huge blaze on the street. Others sprayed graffiti along walls, and smashed windows and lobbed gasoline bombs at subway exits.\n\nPolice then fired a water cannon and tear gas as the crowd approached the government office complex. Most fled but hundreds returned, hurling objects into the complex.\n\nMembers of an elite police squad, commonly known as raptors, then charged out suddenly from behind barricades, taking many protesters by surprise. A number who failed to flee in time were subdued and detained in a scene of chaos.\n\nThe raptors, backed by scores of riot police, pursued protesters down the roads to nearby areas. Officers continued to fire multiple rounds of tear gas as the cat-and-mouse clashes continued into nightfall.\n\nThe demonstration was part of global \u201canti-totalitarianism\u201d rallies planned in over 60 cities worldwide to denounce \u201cChinese tyranny.\u201d Thousands rallied in Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, while more than 1,000 took part in a rally in Sydney.\n\nThe protracted unrest, approaching four months long, has battered Hong Kong\u2019s economy, with businesses and tourism plunging.\n\nChief Executive Lam held her first community dialogue with the public on Thursday in a bid to defuse tensions but failed to persuade protesters, who vowed to press on until their demands are met, including direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders and police accountability.\n\nEarlier Sunday, hundreds of pro-Beijing Hong Kong residents sang the Chinese national anthem and waved red flags at a waterfront cultural center in a show of support for Chinese rule. They were later bused to the Victoria Peak hilltop for the same repertoire.\n\nOrganizer Innes Tang said the crowd responded to his invitation on social media to \u201cpromote positivity and patriotism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to take this time for the people to express our love for our country China. We want to show the international community that there is another voice to Hong Kong\u201d apart from the protests, he said.\n\nMobs of Beijing supporters have appeared in malls and on the streets in recent weeks to counter pro-democracy protesters, leading to brawls between the rival camps.\n\nMany people view the extradition bill, which would have sent criminal suspects to mainland China for trial, as a glaring example of the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nChina has denied chipping away at Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and accused the U.S. and other foreign powers of fomenting the unrest to weaken its dominance.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Resident Pushing Child In Stroller"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/91/b0/1f24fc4949e990f0bd432d1ca371/webp.net-resizeimage%20(41).jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
