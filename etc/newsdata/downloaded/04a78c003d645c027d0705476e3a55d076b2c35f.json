Facebook has declined to do so, raising the larger question of whether such ads on social media should be regulated.\n\nZuckerberg said on Thursday that he\u2019s considered getting rid of political ads on his platforms altogether - it\u2019s a small part of the company\u2019s business -- but banning them would favor incumbents.\n\n\"In a democracy, I believe people should decide what\u2019s credible, not tech companies,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nThe company doesn\u2019t fact-check posts from politicians, including ads, to avoid the appearance that it\u2019s taking sides. Warren took advantage of Facebook\u2019s policy earlier this month with a series of ads claiming Zuckerberg was endorsing Donald Trump for re-election -- which isn\u2019t true. Warren, who is running for the Democratic nomination, ran the false assertion to highlight Facebook\u2019s policy following an ad from Trump that accused fellow Democrat Joe Biden of bribing officials in Ukraine, without any proof.\n\n\"Facebook has chosen to sell Americans\u2019 personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,\" said Bill Russo, a spokesman for Biden.\n\nUphold free speech\n\nZuckerberg also warned that if technology companies and platforms like Facebook don\u2019t fight hard to uphold free speech, the internet could one day look like it does in China. The Chinese government, he said, is building a censored version of the internet, and exporting that version through some of its most popular online services.\n\nHe called out Bytedance Inc. unit TikTok, a rival mobile social network, as one of those services, and said TikTok has censored content from the Hong Kong protests.\n\n\"Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values,\" Zuckerberg said. \"There\u2019s no guarantee these values will win out.\"\n\nZuckerberg also used Thursday\u2019s speech, billed as a conversation on free expression, to argue that the social network\u2019s enormous size and scale offers people a new kind of power: the ability to share their thoughts with the masses. The CEO called this power \"a fifth estate alongside the other power structures in our society.\" He touted the importance of giving individuals a voice, which is where the most progress comes for social change.\n\n\"In times of social turmoil, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression. We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from Birmingham Jail, where he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully.\"\n\nDisinformation\n\nBernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., responded on Twitter, writing that the late civil rights leader was targeted by \"disinformation campaigns launched by politicians\" that \"created an atmosphere for his assassination.\"\n\nInternet services like Facebook can still protect free expression while addressing problems that have been raised by this new technology, Zuckerberg said. He acknowledged that when everyone has a voice, some people will use that to try to organize violence and influence elections. At Facebook\u2019s scale, even if a very small percentage of people try to cause harm, that\u2019s still a lot, Zuckerberg said. The company has chosen to focus on the authenticity of the speaker rather than judging the content itself, he said.\n\nWhile Facebook, as a private business, is not beholden to free-speech rules per the First Amendment, more than 2.7 billion people use its products around the world. The company\u2019s algorithm--software that decides what people see in their feeds--and content policies have a tremendous impact on whose voices are heard.\n\nThe company\u2019s decisions have often been controversial, putting Facebook in a constant defensive posture with many government leaders, who either think Facebook is doing too much or not enough to police its properties.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s election interference in 2016, Facebook has built up an apparatus of third-party fact checkers, responsible for marking a post as false, after which it might be ranked lower in the news feed, but never removed. The system, which often fails to address content until after it\u2019s gone viral, doesn\u2019t apply to political ads.\n\nFacebook\u2019s rules on what stays up and gets taken down on its social network, as well as on Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp platforms, are applied by a global group of thousands of low-wage contractors, who manage more than 100 billion pieces of content across the digital properties daily. The results are often inconsistent, causing confusion. The company is building an independent oversight board that can be the last word on Facebook decisions that users disagree with.\n\nBesides the content policies, Facebook has been under fire for its news feed algorithm, which tends to highlight content that triggers an emotional response in users. That means shocking news, including false information, tends to spread quickly there. Facebook has been hesitant to remove misinformation because of concerns, especially on the conservative side, about showing political bias. Zuckerberg has been meeting conservative pundits to improve the relationship, though the company has said it hasn\u2019t found any evidence of bias.", "description": "\"I don\u2019t think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100% true,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Kurt Wagner", "Sarah Frier"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6532/2d98fbd6a28a449bb9482b5112c60c5b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
