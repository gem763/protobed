You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2014 and I will. I\u2019ve already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson. I have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don\u2019t let the world down. You can make a great deal. General Mazloum is willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they never would have made in the past. I am confidentially enclosing a copy of his letter to me, just received. History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\n\nThe reference to \u201cPastor Brunson\u201d indicates American pastor Andrew Brunson, who was released from a Turkish prison a year ago after the Trump administration applied economic and diplomatic pressure to the Turkish government. \u201cGeneral Mazloum\u201d refers to Kurdish general Mazloum Kobani of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nUpon hearing confirmation that the letter was real, journalists \u2014 particularly those on the left \u2014 expressed shock and horror.\n\nWow. According to Jake Tapper, the White House has confirmed this letter is REAL. I was resisting tweeting because I assumed it must be a hoax. https://t.co/8rk00MAUQp \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 16, 2019\n\nTrump continues to threaten Turkey with economic sanctions unless it halts its offensive in Syria.\n\nJoel B.
