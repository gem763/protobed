REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nApple is developing a new version of its low-cost iPhone SE to be released next spring, according to Nikkei Asian Review.\n\nThe new model will reportedly feature a 4.7-inch screen like the iPhone 8 but will include the same internal components as Apple's next flagship iPhones.\n\nLaunching a new, cheap iPhone could be crucial for Apple to compete with rivals like Huawei and Samsung as it seeks to regain lost ground in the smartphone market. Both of those companies offer mid-range smartphones, unlike Apple.\n\nBringing in new iPhone users is also crucial for Apple to continue growing its wearables and services businesses.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nApple's successors to the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR aren't the only new smartphones the company is rumored to be working on.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant is also readying a new version of its low-cost iPhone SE to be released next spring, according to a new report from Nikkei Asian Review.\n\nApple released the iPhone SE back in 2016 and hasn't launched an updated model since. It shared some features with iPhone 6S \u2014 which was Apple's flagship iPhone model at the time \u2014 such as its A9 processor and the Live Photos feature that animates images taken with the phone's camera. But unlike the iPhone 6S, the iPhone SE was priced at just $400 and came in a more compact form factor reminiscent of the iPhone 5S.\n\nNow, Apple is reportedly planning to revive the iPhone SE in a form factor that would resemble the 4.7-inch iPhone 8. Other than its smaller design, the next-generation iPhone SE is expected to have the same internal components as the new iPhones Apple will likely debut next week, according to the report. It will also reportedly have a liquid crystal display like the $750 iPhone XR.\n\nRead more: Ex-Apple store employees reveal the biggest mistakes customers make at the Genius Bar\n\nIt would be a smart move for Apple that could help it reclaim lost market share and boost iPhone upgrades at a time when smartphone shipments are continuing to decline globally.\n\nHere's a closer look at why launching a new iPhone SE could be just as important for Apple as its new flagship iPhone.", "description": "Apple is on the verge of releasing the iPhone 11.
