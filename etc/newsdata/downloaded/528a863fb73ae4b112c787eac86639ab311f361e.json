(Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nAt a minimum, the whole House should vote on whether or not to shove America down this rocky path.\n\nNancy Pelosi is right.\n\n\u201cThis is deadly serious,\u201d the House Speaker said Tuesday, regarding impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. Too bad Pelosi is handling this solemn matter with staggering unseriousness.\n\nAs the Impeachment Express accelerates, the Democratic-controlled House is hell-bent on removing America\u2019s duly elected president of the United States. This is among the gravest contingencies in this constitutional republic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn something so momentous, the House should operate once again on a bipartisan basis:\n\nBefore President Bill Clinton was impeached, the House voted on October 8, 1998. The tally was 258\u2013176 to advance an impeachment probe, with 31 Democrats resisting their party leaders.\n\nAt the depths of Watergate, on February 4, 1974, the House voted 410\u20134 \u2014 on a nearly unanimous, bipartisan basis \u2014 to launch the impeachment of President Richard Milhous Nixon. He resigned that August 9, before the House adopted articles of impeachment, but after the emergence of severely incriminating evidence of his illegality. (What a concept!)\n\nThe House also voted 126\u201347 to commence the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson on February 24, 1868.\n\nPelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, hurled these precedents off the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that we have a vote,\u201d she declared Tuesday. \u201cSo, at this time, we will not be having a vote.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue, despite these three powerful precedents, the Constitution does not compel a full-House vote to start the impeachment ball rolling. Regardless, Pelosi avoids this opening move because she might lose such a vote or, ultimately, her majority if she forced certain members to support a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi is speaker thanks to 31 Democrats who won districts in 2018 that Trump secured in 2016. These Trump-district Democrats fear, as does Nervous Nancy, that if they back an impeachment probe, some will face furious constituents, lose their seats, and hand the House back to Republicans.\n\nSo, as she clutches to political control like a life preserver, Pelosi preserves the political lives of these 31 Democrats.\n\nBeyond this non-vote strategy, Pelosi and her far-Left colleagues have little interest in due process or first-grade-level fairness. These Democrats \u2014the sorest losers in the history of human competition \u2014 lust to oust a president whose guts they hate, largely for the warm rush of doing so. Unlike the widely watched Nixon and Clinton impeachment hearings, Pelosi\u2019s persecution happens behind closed doors, with all the transparency of a casket. Trump\u2019s attorneys cannot cross-examine witnesses, present counterevidence, or simply sit quietly and watch. Even worse, scheming Democrats have barred the American people from this star chamber.\n\nDemocrats often whine that Trump flattens political norms. In fact, the norm-crushing steamroller, finds Pelosi at the wheel, with House Intelligence Chairman Adam \u201cFour Pinocchios\u201d Schiff riding shotgun. Schiff, another California Democrat, is grilling impeachment witnesses in secret. If the House Judiciary Committee were in charge \u2014 as it was in the Clinton, Nixon, and Johnson impeachments \u2014 these perilous developments surely would unfold in public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going forward in the most secret room in the Capital. And all Adam Schiff is doing right now is building a secret record in his SCIF, in a one-sided process to move forward towards impeachment,\u201d Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill Hemmer this morning. (A SCIF is a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. Such a high-tech space is designed to foil eavesdroppers, foreign and domestic.) \u201cI think it\u2019s a very unfair process,\u201d McCaul added. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit of a fishing expedition at this time.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s opening statement at a September 26 hearing included these comments, supposedly from Trump to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand. Lots of dirt, on this and that,\u201d Schiff read aloud. \u201cAnd don\u2019t call me again. I\u2019ll call you when you\u2019ve done what I asked.\u201d\n\nSchiff fabricated these words. Caught red-handed, he claimed he spoke \u201cat least part in parody.\u201d\n\nHilarious.\n\nZelensky repeatedly insists that he felt no such pressure to investigate alleged Biden-family corruption in Ukraine. At a joint September 25 news conference with President Trump at the United Nations, Zelensky said, \u201cnobody pushed me.\u201d Zelensky said on October 10, \u201cThere was no pressure or blackmail from the U.S.\u201d He spoke during a 14-hour \u201cpress marathon\u201d in Kiev, in which he answered unscripted questions from some 300 journalists who interviewed him in 20- to 30-minute sessions, in seven- to 10-member squads. \u201cThis call influenced only one thing. We needed to secure a meeting, that it was necessary to meet with the president,\u201d Zelensky added, referring to Trump. \u201cI wanted to show him our team, our young team. I wanted to get him into Ukraine.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Trump did not threaten to withhold U.S. military aid, absent a Ukrainian probe of the Bidens. Though such assets were being withheld at the time, Ukrainian officials were reportedly unaware of this during the July 25 Trump/Zelensky phone call. Zelensky told journalists in Kiev on October 10: \u201cI had no idea the military aid was held up.\u201d These weapons \u2014 which Obama never even offered \u2014 arrived not long after Trump and Zelensky conversed. Specifically, Zelensky and Vice President Mike Pence spoke in Warsaw on September 1. Zelensky explained: \u201cAnd after this meeting, the U.S. unlocked the aid and added $140 million. That\u2019s why there was no blackmail.\u201d As Reuters reported, the Trump administration freed the military assistance to Kiev on September 11, thus bolstering Ukraine\u2019s defenses against Russia and refuting the lie that Trump is a Kremlin stooge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPresident Obama was sending you pillows and sheets,\u201d Trump told Zelensky at the U.N. \u201cI gave you anti-tank busters.\u201d\n\nThese facts should compel the House to abandon this self-indulgent nonsense and \u2014 radical idea \u2014 return to governing this republic, starting with a vote on the USMCA trade agreement among America, Mexico, and Canada. At a minimum, the whole House should vote on whether or not to shove America down this rocky path, adjudicate this matter in public, and stop basing these decisions on how best to insulate 31 Trump-district Democrats from the righteous rage of their own voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Malarkey contributed research to this opinion piece.", "description": "\u201cThis is deadly serious,\u201d the House Speaker said Tuesday, regarding impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.
