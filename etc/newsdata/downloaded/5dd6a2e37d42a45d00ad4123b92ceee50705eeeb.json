Visits were conducted across the country, and at different times during the day between June 1 and Aug. 1, according to QSR.\n\nThe study found Dunkin' had the fastest drive-thru times, with an average of just over 216 seconds. Wendy's and Burger King were second- and third-fastest, respectively.\n\nATM fees hit record high: They average $4.72 per withdrawal, with more coming\n\nUse bad passwords?: Google wants to help.

The magazine notes that Chick-fil-A has attempted several strategies to help speed up their drive-thrus, such as stationing employees with iPads outside to take orders and payments.\n\nOther chains are experimenting with new technologies to help speed up the takeout process. Multiple restaurants offer ordering via smartphone app, allowing users to place their orders in advance, then pick them up at the desired location.\n\nMeanwhile, last month, McDonald's acquired Aprente, a Silicon Valley startup specializing in voice-based ordering technology to help shorten drive-thru wait times.\n\nDrive-thru speed study\n\nAccording to QSR's study, here are the average speeds of service by seconds:\n\nDunkin\u2019: 216.75 seconds Wendy\u2019s: 230.38 Burger King: 235.48 Taco Bell: 240.38 Carl\u2019s Jr.: 240.51 KFC: 243.73 Arby\u2019s: 263.46 Hardee\u2019s: 266.34 McDonald\u2019s: 283.05 Chick-fil-A: 322.98\n\nKelly Tyko contributed to this report.
