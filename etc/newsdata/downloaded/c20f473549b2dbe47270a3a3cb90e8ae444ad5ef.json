That\u2019s ominous.", "language": "en", "text": "Which raises a question: What will happen to the GOP in the After Trump era? Will it become a more nationalist party, along the lines of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision that Trump has been articulating and implementing \u2014 to mostly disastrous effect?\n\nBack in April 2018, this poll found that only 38 percent of Trump voters said the United States had no responsibility to do anything about the fighting in Syria, while 30 percent said it did.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut now, in the new HuffPost/YouGov poll, Trump voters now say by 56 percent to 21 percent that the United States doesn\u2019t have any such responsibility.\n\nA similar thing is happening in mirror image among voters who backed Hillary Clinton: They now overwhelmingly say that the United States does bear such a responsibility.\n\nBut for now, let\u2019s focus on the Trump voters. What seems to have happened, as HuffPost\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy explains, is that positions on this were previously not that deeply held \u2014 but Trump\u2019s pullout suddenly sent cues to voters, resulting in a much larger percentage holding a real position. Thus, among Trump voters, a solid majority now sees no responsibility.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s often suggested that Trump\u2019s base supports his pullout from Syria because it is \u201cwar weary,\u201d and Trump campaigned on a promise to end entanglements in the Mideast. But it\u2019s likely that the Trump base is also hearing something very different from Trump about what his Syria posture really means.\n\nAD\n\nFor one thing, while Trump regularly casts this decision as fulfilling a promise to end our \u201cForever Wars,\u201d Trump\u2019s actual prosecution of current conflicts and other engagements abroad isn\u2019t at all dovish, as The Post\u2019s Ishaan Tharoor details.\n\nIndeed, Trump didn\u2019t really campaign on an antiwar position. What he really promised was to use overwhelming force to smash the terrorist enemy \u2014 and vowed to do so effortlessly, while also magically avoiding entanglements abroad. Remember how he talked about \u201cbombing the s--t\u201d out of the Islamic State, vowed to revive waterboarding and \u201cmuch worse,\u201d and even said of terrorists that he would \u201ctake out their families\u201d?\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in justifying his Syria stance, Trump often articulates what sounds less like a principled antiwar stance, and something that sounds more like an affirmative, unabashed hand-washing of responsibility for outcomes abroad. This brash renunciation, this flaunting of the proposition that he will (supposedly) put America first, no matter what the consequences elsewhere, is a key feature of his posture, one that regularly eludes commentators.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly plausible that this stance is what Trump voters \u2014 and the Republican base \u2014 are increasingly gravitating toward.\n\nConsider some other issues \u2014 such as, say, immigration.\n\nRon Brownstein recently undertook an extensive analysis and concluded that Trump\u2019s xenophobia, his hate-rhetoric about migrants, is pushing the GOP overall into a more nativist posture than it had held previously. As Brownstein noted, more than four-fifths of House Republicans and nearly two-thirds of Senate Republicans voted for Trump\u2019s proposed deep cuts to legal immigration.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s a geographic dimension to Trump\u2019s increasingly nativist GOP. As Brownstein pointed out, fewer than 1 in 10 House Republicans now come from districts with more foreign-born residents than the national average, and Republicans now hold 30 of the seats in the 20 states with the smallest shares of immigrants.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, a recent CNN poll found that large majorities of Trump-approving voters oppose allowing Central American refugees to apply for asylum in the United States and approve of how migrants are currently treated. Meanwhile, only small minorities of Americans overall held those positions.\n\nOn top of all this, by pushing so hard for a border wall, Trump has forced the electorate to polarize around a massive symbol of xenophobic exclusion. And Republican voters have taken this up with gusto: Overwhelming majorities of them support not just the wall, but also Trump\u2019s abuse of emergency powers to build it.\n\nAD\n\nTaken all together, then, one can envision a future GOP that\u2019s much more Trumpified around this middle-finger-to-the-world-unfurling set of supposed \u201cAmerica First\u201d priorities. Which could mean it\u2019s time to start seriously thinking about future GOP presidential candidates such as conservative nationalist and friend-of-the-blog Josh Hawley.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Whither the Trumpified, 'America First' GOP?", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4PjRO1ykJ_OOaVKZLDP-nd67X9o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2YLLMMXXI4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
