The former vice president bragged publicly last year about holding $1 billion in American loan guarantees over the Ukrainian government's head in order to get the prosecutor dismissed.\n\nCNN's poll, released Wednesday, shows Biden with his largest lead among Democratic presidential candidates since the week he announced his campaign in late April.\n\nHe held a dominating lead at the time with 39 per cent support.\n\nBiden, Sanders and Warren will meet later this week in South Carolina, speaking at a public forum hosted by the Bipartisan Justice Center.\n\nElizabeth Warren is in second place, but 15 points behind Biden \u2013 who has picked up 10 in the past 5 weeks\n\nBernie Sanders is running in third place; his total and Warren's combined barely reach Biden's number\n\nBiden is also far in front of Trump in CNN's poll, beating him 53\u201343 in a hypothatical head-to-head matchup.\n\nHe has large polling advantages over his Democratic rivals on foreign policy, the economy, immigration and gun control.\n\nFifty-six per cent of Democratic voters say Biden is the best choice to manage foreign affairs, far ahead of Sanders at 13 per cent and Warren at 11 per cent.\n\nBut Sanders has closed the gap with him on health care, where Biden leads him 31\u201328.\n\nBiden also runs even with Sanders on climate change, with both of them rating 26 per cent support in their party.", "description": "Joe Biden is so far ahead of his more liberal presidential rivals that he can barely hear them shouting about income inequality and government-run health care.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20084984-0-image-a-12_1571837937904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
