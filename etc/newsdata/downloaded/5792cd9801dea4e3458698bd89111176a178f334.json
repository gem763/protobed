But I don\u2019t know. It depends if they made it back to the shore or not I guess.\u2019\n\nPlease tell us they did, Sharon!\n\nThe actress is also known for the 00s comedy series Pulling, and for creating the HBO series Divorce, starring Sex and the City\u2019s Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nThe talented lady recently wrote and directed an episode of Modern Love, the romantic Amazon Video series which stars the likes of Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey and Dev Patel.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
