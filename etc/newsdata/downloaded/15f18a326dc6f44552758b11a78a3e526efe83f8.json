There\u2019s always going to be pressure on Liverpool because they are the top team at the moment, everybody wants to beat them.\n\n\u2018The gap is still six points and they haven\u2019t lost a game in the league yet this season. Six points is a big gap at this stage of the season, so I thought Sunday\u2019s result was a good one for Liverpool.\u2019\n\nThe Gunners hero added: \u2018They didn\u2019t do anything wrong last season, did they? Manchester City won their last 14 games of the season. They pulled up trees. What can you do about that? You can\u2019t do anything about that.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018They just have to worry about themselves. That\u2019s all you can do. They\u2019ve got to keep going and they are still favourites in my eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Liverpool need to win next weekend [against Tottenham]. Manchester City play before them and if Pep Guardiola\u2019s side get a win then the gap is down to three points.\n\n\u2018There will obviously be a game in hand, but the pressure will be different as Liverpool will need to win.\n\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s Champions League holders are top of the Premier League (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018They then play Man City in a few weeks and if Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side win the game and go nine points clear, you\u2019d probably say goodnight to the title race.\n\n\u2018Liverpool would have to throw it away big time from there.\u2019\n\nDespite missing out on the Premier League title last season, Liverpool still enjoyed a brilliant campaign, lifting the Champions League after beating Tottenham in Madrid.\n\nManchester City won the Premier League title last term (Picture: AP)\n\nAnd Merson can see the Reds conquering Europe again this term after raising question marks over fellow contenders Man City, Juventus and Bayern Munich.\n\n\u2018City are a very good team, but they are not going to win the Champions League, playing against the best teams in Europe, with two holding midfielders in defence,\u2019 Merson said.\n\n\u2018They need Aymeric Laporte back. I thought Juventus would be one of the dangers, but I watched them the other night and they are not going to win it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When Bayern Munich rinsed Tottenham the other week, I didn\u2019t think they were the team to beat. I didn\u2019t think that at all if I\u2019m being honest. I thought they looked quite open.\n\n\u2018I still think Liverpool are the team to beat. They lost in the final two seasons ago and then won it last season. Who\u2019s got better form than that?\n\n\u2018They hardly ever lose at home, if ever. No one wants to go and play at Anfield. I still think Liverpool will be there or thereabouts come the end of the competition.\u2019\n\nMORE: Paul Merson slams Unai Emery\u2019s Arsenal and says nothing has changed since Arsene Wenger left", "description": "Paul Merson has backed Liverpool to end their long wait for a Premier League title and explained why Manchester City will not win the Champions League this season.
