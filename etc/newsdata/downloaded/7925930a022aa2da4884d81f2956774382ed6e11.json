A new study, conducted by Oregon State University, shows that cats can form bonds with their caretakers, similar to how dogs and babies do. Cats are just more aloof. But we already knew that, didn\u2019t we?\n\nFor the study, which was published Monday in the scientific journal Current Biology, researchers observed a total of 70 kittens between the ages of three and eight months. First, the cats were put in a room with their owners for two minutes, then, separate for the same amount of time, returning for a two-minute reunion. About 64 percent of the kittens displayed a secure attachment to their owner.\n\nThe remaining 36 percent of \u201cinsecurely attached\u201d felines were categorized as ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized, so, yes, there are still some cats out there that would rather have absolutely nothing to do with us. However, while some may argue that cats generally don\u2019t have the same companionship qualities that dogs do, this study proves otherwise.\n\nResearchers also studied cats who were over a year older and found similar findings, proving the attachment doesn\u2019t go away. \u201cThe characteristics of a secure cat, for example, [are] greeting their owner and then going back to what they were doing,\u201d Kristyn Vitale, lead study author, told NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s how a secure human also behaves.\u201d\n\nVitale also said that most cats are looking to their owners for safety and security. \u201cIt\u2019s important for owners to think about that,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re in a stressful situation, how they\u2019re behaving can actually have a direct impact on their cats\u2019 behavior.\u201d So if you\u2019re feeling zen, your cat will be, too.\n\nStay in touch.
