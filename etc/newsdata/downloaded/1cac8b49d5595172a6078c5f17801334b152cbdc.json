She can\u2019t force the police to investigate and she can\u2019t make prosecutors try her case, because the state has vast discretion in how it handles criminal cases.\u201d\n\nThis epidemic of disbelief is what led as many as 200,000 rape kits in the U.S. to be shelved and left untested for decades, sealing shut unthinkable trauma and letting serial rapists walk. Hagerty looks into progress made since the Obama administration launched the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative (SAKI) in 2015: The Justice Department has so far awarded $154 million to 54 jurisdictions. Of those, just two sites\u2014Detroit and Cleveland\u2014have made a significant effort to test rape kits, open investigations, and prosecute assailants. The results in these two cities alone have been stunning.\n\nBut everywhere else, \u201cthe distance between aspiration and accomplishment is startling.\u201d In response to FOIA requests, Hagerty reports that of the dozens of sites that received SAKI funding, Cleveland and Detroit alone have accounted for 38 percent of new investigations, 69 percent of charges brought, and 82 percent of convictions. Wisconsin, which received $5.1 million in funding, has had zero convictions. Iowa and Connecticut, which received $3 million and $3.3 million respectively, have not made a single charge or conviction. If Detroit and Cleveland have been so successful in testing rape kits and identifying dozens of serial rapists, then why have other police departments been unable to achieve the same results?\n\nHagerty writes that it all comes back, again and again, to law enforcement\u2019s abiding skepticism of women who report being raped. A Cleveland detective who conducts training programs across the country says that officers continue to tell him privately that they think many women lie about being raped, and their claims aren\u2019t worth investigating.\n\n\u201cYet even as police and prosecutors seem stuck in time, our culture is moving forward,\u201d Hagerty writes. \u201cToo many women have disclosed their #MeToo moments; too many rape kits have been pulled out of storage rooms.\u201d As the successes in Cleveland and Detroit demonstrate, when police take women\u2019s claims seriously, rapists can be convicted. \u201cSerial rapists could be swept from the streets and untold numbers of women could escape the worst moments of their life, if police and prosecutors would suspend their disbelief.\u201d\n\nRead \u201cAn Epidemic of Disbelief\u201d at The Atlantic.
