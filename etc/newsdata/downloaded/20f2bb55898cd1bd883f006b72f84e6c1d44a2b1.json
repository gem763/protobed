Now it reportedly wants to do it again.\n\nThe White House has requested $5 billion for barrier construction in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s fiscal year 2020 budget, but The Washington Post\u2019s Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey report that if that funding is not approved, senior administration officials are considering a plan to divert another $3.6 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s construction budget.\n\nThree administration officials reportedly told the Post that, at a meeting earlier this month led by Trump adviser and son in law Jared Kushner, senior officials discussed pressing lawmakers to reimburse the $3.6 billion in Pentagon funds that were diverted toward barrier construction this year.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to sell it as replenishment money to the Defense Department for the $3.6 billion they took this year,\u201d one unnamed administration official told the Post. \u201cThen once they got it from Congress, they would take it again.\u201d\n\nThe Post also reports that planning documents it obtained show the cost of building 509 miles of barriers \u2014 enough to fulfill Trump\u2019s pledge to complete nearly 500 miles by the 2020 election \u2014 is projected to total $18.4 billion through next year, \u201cfar more than the administration has publicly disclosed.\u201d The White House had reportedly said last year that it planned to put up more than 700 miles of barrier over a decade at a cost of $18 billion. The latest cost figures average out to more than $36 million per mile.\n\nThe planning documents reportedly also indicate that the government would need to buy or seize under eminent-domain claims land that lies under 187 miles of proposed barrier, more than a third of the planned construction.\n\nTrump\u2019s drive to be able to show some progress on barrier construction has also raised concerns that the Army Corps of Engineers \u201cis being pressured to bypass regular contracting processes in order to complete construction more quickly,\u201d according to a letter sent by Rep.
