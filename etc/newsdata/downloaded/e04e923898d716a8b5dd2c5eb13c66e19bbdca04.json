We cannot in good conscience show it to you @chucktodd: \"Politics ain\u2019t beanbag, but it isn\u2019t supposed to be this either.

Chuck Todd insisting he would refuse to air the president's attacks on Hunter Biden because he's somehow not a public figure. The company that signs Chuck's paychecks ROUTINELY mocks the president's progeny as childish morons on \"SNL.\" https://t.co/YOkLkoi31m \u2014 Tim Graham (@TimJGraham) October 12, 2019\n\nCensorship in service of The Democrat Party. \u2014 Doug Ross \ud83d\udd35 (@directorblue) October 12, 2019\n\nThe purpose of a news organization is to inform, good, bad, and otherwise. It's too much for @NBCNews to stomach, eh? Whether you like what a candidate has to say, perhaps even more so if you don't, it's your obligation to provide the news and let others decide for themselves. \u2014 Nieds Dead Horse (@NDH_j_m_f) October 12, 2019\n\nMuch of the mainstream media consider their job to be to filter to what people see and hear instead of just reporting what\u2019s going on.", "description": "\"It\u2019s cute when the left-wing network that protected and ran interference for Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer pretends to have a moral conscience.\"", "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chucktodd_AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
