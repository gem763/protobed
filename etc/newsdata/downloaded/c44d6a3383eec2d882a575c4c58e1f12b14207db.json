Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable. https://t.co/QcC25vhNeb \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 22, 2019\n\nThe Biden campaign declined to give a statement to HuffPost on the matter. However, in a tweet published Tuesday night, Biden acknowledged that he regretted his past remark.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that.

At the start of the inquiry, Rep. Maxine Waters of California said that \u201cfundamental fairness and due process requires that we adhere to reason and precedence or else we risk being viewed as no different than the lynch mobs which denied justice to the accused.\u201d\n\nThen-Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York and Rep. Danny Davis of Illinois also spoke about a \u201clynching\u201d with regard to Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\nTwo more Democrats \u2015 then-Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington and Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York \u2015 used the term \u201clynch mob\u201d in media interviews at the time.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post on Tuesday, Meeks, who is Black, acknowledged his past remarks but noted that \u201ccontext matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a difference when that word is used by someone of my experience and perspective, whose relatives were the targets of lynch mobs, compared to a president who has dog-whistled to white nationalists and peddled racism,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has made racist comments on numerous occasions, including his recent social media attacks on lawmakers of color, including four progressive congresswomen and the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and his majority-Black Baltimore district, which the president called a \u201crodent infested mess.\u201d\n\nTrump has also in the past neglected to disavow endorsements from the Ku Klux Klan and infamously claimed after the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d after a counterprotester was hit and killed by a neo-Nazi driver.\n\nThis article has been updated with Biden\u2019s response in a tweet.", "description": "Several other Democrats also used the term in reference to the former president's impeachment in 1998.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf9d16210000ad1e34ac1b.jpeg?cache=vhnbomjbgd&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
