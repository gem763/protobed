Keeping Firmino in check will be key.\n\n(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\n\"If he finds space far from goal, Spurs should let him go. They don't want to get dragged in because then he will lead players to places they don't want to go and the other two will exploit any space that will be left behind.\n\n\"But Tottenham can get something from the game. Liverpool were strong against Genk in the Champions League but they have had a few wobbles in the league recently.\n\n\"Sheffield United should have got a point against them, while Leicester were denied by a late penalty at Anfield.\n\n\"Manchester United claimed a draw against Jurgen Klopp's side last week and I am convinced Spurs can do the same.\"", "description": "The Premier League leaders host Mauricio Pochettino's side on Sunday", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Getty Images", "Camerasport Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659730.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Burnley-FC-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
