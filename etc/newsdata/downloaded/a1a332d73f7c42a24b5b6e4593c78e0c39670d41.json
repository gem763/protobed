It\u2019s the first pro Adobe app to make it to the App Store since Apple redesigned it with Mojave, last year\u2019s version of macOS.\n\nThe Mac App Store version of Lightroom is the \u201cnew\u201d Lightroom formerly known as Lightroom CC, which syncs with complementary mobile and tablet apps and has a different UI to what is now called Lightroom Classic. It\u2019s free to download and use for a week, then it\u2019ll require a $9.99 monthly subscription through Apple\u2019s in-app purchasing system, which includes 1TB of cloud storage.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that you\u2019ve been able to get Lightroom in the Mac App Store. Back in 2012, when Adobe sold its apps as standalone purchases before starting to push Creative Cloud subscriptions, Lightroom 4 was available for $149.99. Lightroom 5 never came to Apple\u2019s store, however, and even Adobe itself doesn\u2019t sell standalone versions of Lightroom today.\n\nThe news won\u2019t mean much for existing Lightroom users, but it is a sign that Adobe sees a potential market for pro app subscriptions through the Mac App Store and wants to take it more seriously. It\u2019s also possible that the redesigned store\u2019s promotional features, including editorial content such as tips and how-to articles, could introduce new customers to Adobe\u2019s software.", "description": "Adobe has made Lightroom, its pro photo editing and management tool, available on the Mac App Store.
