Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.\n\nCatherine the Great, empress of Russia between 1762 and 1796, must have been lurking in the crosshairs of TV producers for years, and now HBO have given it the bells and whistles treatment. She is a dream of a subject: ruthless, compassionate, brilliant, vulnerable, and troubled, who ruled the largest country on Earth for 30 years while maintaining a genuinely spicy private life.\n\nIn pre-publicity interviews Mirren has had to explain that despite what the naysayers might think, her character did not, in fact, die having sex with a horse, which I don\u2019t remember coming up when the Dame was doing the rounds with Stephen Frears.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to pack in. As the first episode opens, Catherine visits \u201cprisoner number one\u201d in his cell. This is Ivan VI, one of several thousand pretenders to the throne, who has been driven mad by years of confinement. His claim is only one of her long list of headaches.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Or Alayned, perhaps.\u201d BBC 15/37 Leaving Neverland (Channel 4) \"Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland\u201d AFP/Getty 16/37 Home (Channel 4) \"Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme \u2013 but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he\u2019s stray cat that\u2019s just wandered in.\" Channel 4 17/37 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC) \"A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando\u2019s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can\u2019t really add anything to that.\" PA 18/37 Derry Girls (Channel 4) \"It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man\u2019s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.\" Peter Marley 19/37 Fleabag (BBC) \"While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O\u2019Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.\" BBC/Two Brothers/Luke Varley 20/37 Road to Brexit (BBC) \"The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it\u2019s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don\u2019t understand. Rather, it\u2019s a very clever, very funny, very 'different' parcel of bollocks to Brexit.\" BBC 21/37 Our Planet (Netflix) \"The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can\u2019t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.\" Netflix 22/37 Line of Duty (BBC) \"Plausibility is a spectrum; Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the individual. The shadowy government forces are elected; the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It\u2019s exhausting work, policing the police.\" BBC 23/37 The Virtues \"Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham\u2019s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\" Dean Rogers/Channel 4 24/37 Good Omens 'Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett\u2019s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.' Amazon Prime 25/37 Years and Years \"Years and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.\" BBC 26/37 Killing Eve \"As the series develops, it\u2019s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 27/37 Chernobyl \"Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.\" HBO 28/37 The Handmaid's Tale \"Season three's knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.\" Hulu 29/37 This Way Up \"The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.\" Channel 4 30/37 Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain \"A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.\" Channel 4 31/37 Succession \"Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won\u2019t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.\" HBO 32/37 Kathy Burke\u2019s All Woman \"In Kathy Burke\u2019s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women \u2013 from nuns to reality stars \u2013 to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.\" Channel 4 33/37 The Capture \"So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.\" BBC/Heyday Films/Nick Wall 34/37 Top Boy \"Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.\" Netflix 35/37 Criminal \"Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.\" Netflix 36/37 Tories at War \"After an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language; the visceral hatred; the unbearable tensions; the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives \u2013 it was like watching my first Saw movie.\" Pro Co 37/37 World on Fire \"In a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it\u2019s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.\" BBC/Mammoth Screen 1/37 Doctor Who - New Year's Day special (BBC1) \u201cAs a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who \u2013 i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks \u2013 this is a New Year treat that more than delivers\u201d BBC 2/37 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2) \u201cBilly Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity \u2013 a \u201cProustian wander through Scotland\u201d.

A strapping young officer, Grigory Potemkin (Jason Clarke), is on the make, and has caught the eye of the empress and her friend the Countess Bruce (Gina McKee). The older men, especially former favourite Orlov (Richard Roxburgh), are suspicious. Catherine\u2019s advisor Panin (Rory Kinnear) seems to have her best interests at heart, but while he admires her, truthfully he thinks her son, Paul (Joseph Quinn), ought to be on the throne. Juggling all this while advocating reform for the serfs: it\u2019s a wonder she has time for romance.\n\nIt looks sumptuous. There are endless palaces and balls and luminous outfits, reds and greens and gold. Who knew 18th century Russia had such good dry cleaners? Given the scale, Mirren has to play her character louder than she might otherwise, but she still has a deft way of mixing humanity in with all the grandeur. I suppose playing 4,000 queens in her career has given her a bit of practice.\n\nIt helps to have Clarke, Roxburgh and Kinnear, three of the best going, around her, broad-shouldered men in this women\u2019s world. If the dialogue is occasionally over-expository, that\u2019s understandable, and on the whole the starry team makes cantering over all this historical turf look surprisingly intimate.\n\nCatherine\u2019s not quite great, yet, but she\u2019s very good.\n\nCatherine the Great is now available in full on Sky on Demand and NOW TV", "description": "At last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen?
