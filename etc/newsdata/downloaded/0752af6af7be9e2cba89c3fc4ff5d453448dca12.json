I have to go back to this? No, I don't wanna hear nothing, even rain,\" she said.\n\nHer home, along with almost everything else in the mostly-Haitian shantytown called \"The Mudd,\" is gone.\n\nHumberto resurfaced feelings of terror for Dorian survivors -- just two weeks after the Category 5 storm decimated much of Grand Bahamas and Abaco Islands.\n\nEveryday sounds of Nassau trigger terrifying memories for Silien, even the sounds of an airplane are too much for her.\n\n\"I jumped up, I thought it was a storm outside. When I come to the door, it was nothing and the officer was like, 'What happened?'\" Silien recalled of the her shock. \"I asked ... if it was another hurricane and he said no and he said 'that's the airplane!,' - I said Jesus Christ!\"\n\nAs she waits to transfer to her third shelter in ten days, her only focus is finding and burying the bodies of her mother and brother who both died in her arms during the storm.\n\n\"I lift my brother ... lift him, literally lift him with my hands and the other friends bring him by the road,\" she said. \"They found some bodies, they didn't find some bodies ... but I know my mommy and my brother were there.\"\n\nThe official death toll for The Bahamas remains at 50 since it was announced nearly a week ago but officials have cautioned the number is likely to increase dramatically as more people are identified.\n\nSilien says she told the government about her mother, brother, and a cousin who all died during the storm.\n\nHaitians concerned about their safety following storm\n\nAlthough Silien says she's grateful for how she's been treated in the shelters, she does not want to stay in Nassau.\n\nShe, and other evacuees of Haitian descent have described the area as unwelcoming after a round of posts on Whatsapp singled out the community following the storm.\n\nOdiles and Agnes Pierre escaped from Abaco with their four children and are now staying with a friend of his boss as they wait to get out of Nassau.\n\n\"We don't want to live in Nassau, because few people said that, in videos and other, we should kill all Haitians because they caused the hurricane that destroyed Abaco,\" Agnes Pierre told CNN.\n\nSome of the messages cheered the destruction of primarily Haitian communities like the Mudd and made death threats and claims that the hurricane was a punishment for a belief in voodoo.\n\nThe Pierre family is afraid for their safety following Hurricane Dorian.\n\n\"I don't want to get killed. I been through so much, we survived from it now ... I don't want to come here and just die,\" the mother told CNN.\n\nWhen speaking to CNN, many local Bahamians repeatedly referred to the Haitians as \"illegal,\" explaining there are deep-seated tensions between the groups.\n\nBut government officials have said repeatedly that all Dorian victims will be treated equally when it comes to disaster relief.\n\nThe Pierre family doesn't trust that promise and wants to get their kids out of The Bahamas.\n\n\"I would like for us to get to the states, until the island comes back, so at least my kids can go to school and feel comfortable,\" Odiles Pierre said.\n\nHowever, the chance of getting a US visa quickly are slim as they lost important documents during the storm that also left them without jobs.", "description": "As Tropical Storm Humberto passed by the Bahamas before becoming a hurricane, residents recovering from Hurricane Dorian worried they would be pummeled again before being able to recover.", "authors": ["Dianne Gallagher"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190912193133-bahamas-us-weather-hurricane-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
