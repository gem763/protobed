William McRaven said China's growing technological capabilities should be a \"holy s--- moment\" for the US.\n\nBut technological prowess is only one part of military dominance, and there are other areas where China is lacking.\n\nVisit Business Insider's home page for more stories.\n\nChina's intellectual property theft of both civil and military information is no secret.\n\nFrom alleged attempts to hack into Swedish telecom provider Ericsson to the theft of information related to the F-22 and F-35, there are several instances of China gaining access to foreign technology or trying to do so.\n\nThere are also examples of Chinese military systems looking suspiciously like US systems \u2014 the F-22 and the MQ-9 Reaper drone among them. Other elements of those Chinese systems \u2014 the software, technology, and manpower used to operate them \u2014 aren't on par with the US military yet.\n\nBut they might not be far behind, according to Defense Secretary Mark Esper. At the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity Summit on Thursday, he warned that China is perpetrating \"the greatest intellectual property theft in human history.\"\n\nEsper told attendees that he had cautioned European allies against allowing Chinese companies to build 5G cyber networks in their countries, warning that to do so would risk sensitive national security information.\n\n\"Every Chinese company has the potential to be an accomplice in Beijing's state-sponsored campaign to steal technology,\" he said, highlighting China's integration of civil and military technology, an area in which Beijing surpasses the US.\n\n\"China has systematically sought to acquire US technology both through traditional espionage means, as well as through legal investments in companies,\" Daniel Kliman, director of the the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, told Insider.\n\n\"The United States very much still retains a military technological edge, but it's clear that edge is eroding,\" Kliman said.\n\nRead on to see how China's carbon copies stack up to US weapons systems.", "description": "At the National Cybersecurity Summit on Thursday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper sounded the alarm over China's growing 5G dominance.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a5c692e22af0caa3e14e2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
