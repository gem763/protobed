To maximize parent-child bonding, though, a study says parents are better off reading to their children from a print book than from a tablet.\n\nParents who read to their child on a tablet, whether or not the digital book is interactive, had less social reciprocity -- that is, give-and-take social interaction -- than when they read a traditional book, according to findings published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nResearchers from the University of Michigan recorded 37 parent-child duos in a lab set up to look like a living room. Mothers and fathers would read aloud one print book, one tablet book and one interactive tablet book in a 75-minute period to their 2- to 3-year-old children.\n\nWhen parents read digital books, researchers noted that children were much more likely to interrupt the session, obstructing their parents' view of the tablet so they couldn't read it, closing out of the e-book app or grabbing the tablet from their parents.\n\nIn response, parents were more likely to control their children while reading from a tablet. Intrusive behaviors, such as preventing children from tapping the tablet or pivoting their bodies away from the children so they can hold the tablet, can impede toddlers' willingness to cooperate with or listen to their parents, researchers said.", "description": "Parents who read to their child on a tablet, whether or not the digital book is interactive, had less social reciprocity -- that is, give-and-take social interaction -- than when they read a traditional book, according to findings published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150429203753-07-screen-free-super-169.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
