Drugmaker Teva TEVA, +2.20% would contribute $20 million in cash and $20 million worth of suboxone, a drug used to treat opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that the counties got a very good deal for themselves, but we also set an important national benchmark for the others,\u201d Shkolnick said.\n\nSeparately, the small distributor Henry Schein also announced Monday that it\u2019s settling with Summit County for $1.25 million. The company was not named in Cuyahoga\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nAfter the new settlements and previous ones with five other drugmakers, the only defendant left in the trial that had been scheduled for Monday is the pharmacy chain Walgreens WBA, -0.80% . The new plan is for Walgreens and other pharmacies to go to trial within six months if they don\u2019t reach settlements first.\n\nPolster said the deal with Teva and the distributors was reached very early Monday morning.\n\nThe judge overseeing the federal litigation had long pushed for settlements that would not only provide for damages for the plaintiffs, but also change practices as a way to make a dent in the opioid crisis.\n\nParties say talks on a global settlement will continue.\n\nIndustry CEOs and attorneys general from four states met Friday in a daylong session in Cleveland where the offer in place was a deal worth potentially $48 billion in cash and drugs over time to settle cases nationally. The deal was not completed partly because of disagreements between state and local governments over how to allocate the settlement, which would have come from the three big distributors, Teva and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe epidemic has become more complicated in the past decade, with fatal overdose numbers rising largely because of illicit drugs such as heroin and fentanyl.\n\nThe settlement efforts until now have been mixed.\n\nFour drugmakers reached deals only with the two Ohio counties \u2014 enough to get them out of the first trial, but leaving unresolved the claims from communities across the country.\n\nOxyContin maker Purdue Pharma reached a tentative settlement last month that could be worth up to $12 billion over time. But half the states and hundreds of local governments oppose it. The company is now going through federal bankruptcy proceedings in White Plains, New York, creating the possibility that its settlement offer could be renegotiated.", "description": "The nation\u2019s most prominent drug distributors have agreed to a $260 million settlement in a lawsuit related to the opioid crisis.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT693_opioid_ZG_20191021100639.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
