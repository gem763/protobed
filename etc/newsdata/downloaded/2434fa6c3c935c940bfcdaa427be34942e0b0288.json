And notably, the central bank said it expects that program \u201cto run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates.\u201d\n\nStock futures maintained their gains after the decision, with S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures both up 0.2%.\n\nYields of 10-year benchmark bonds in Germany dropped eight basis points to -0.64% after the news. The German economy has showed signs of a manufacturing-driven slowdown in recent months, which may have contributed to the ECB\u2019s decision.\n\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell as well, declining five basis points to 2.9%.\n\nThe biggest moves were in bonds of European countries with more stressed government-debt markets, however. The yield on Italy\u2019s 10-year government bond fell 18 basis points to 0.79% after the news, and Portugal\u2019s 10-year bond was down 12 basis points to 0.15%.\n\nThe euro slid against the U.S. dollar on the news, and was down 0.7% in morning trading as ECB President Mario Draghi spoke with the press about the decision. Gold\u2019s spot price rose 1.6% to $1,521.35.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Scaggs at alexandra.scaggs@barrons.com", "description": "The European Central Bank unveiled a surprisingly ambitious stimulus package\u2014including a bond-buying program\u2014to stave off an economic slowdown.
