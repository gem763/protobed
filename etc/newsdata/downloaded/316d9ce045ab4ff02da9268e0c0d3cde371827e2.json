The two crashes took a total of 346 lives.\n\nThe U.S. manufacturer has spent months working to update critical flight control software at the centre of both crashes, in hopes of winning FAA approval for the planes to fly again in the United States between October and December.\n\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is examining the 737 MAX design, said recently there was still no appropriate response to issues with the integrity of the aircraft's angle of attack system.\n\nIn both crashes, erroneous data triggered the activation of an automated system that repeatedly pushed down the plane's nose.\n\nPaul Njoroge, who lost his wife, three children and mother-in-law in the Ethiopian crash, and Chris Moore, who lost his daughter, held pictures of victims outside the meeting.\n\nThe FAA has said it wants input from EASA and international regulators from Canada and Brazil before it conducts a certification test flight, a key step before final approval.\n\nTransport Canada said on Monday that human factors and pilot workload were among areas it was continuing to assess before allowing the return to service of the aircraft.\n\nThe 737 MAX grounding is not on the agenda of the assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization, which sets global standards for 193 member countries and runs from Tuesday until Oct. 4.\n\nHowever, the United States, Canada, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago jointly presented a paper urging the U.N. aviation arm to study how to improve minimum pilot training standards in what would be the first broad review of training requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Allison Lampert and Allison Martell in Montreal; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Tracy Rucinski in Chicago; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Tom Brown)", "description": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration invited continued feedback from global regulators at a Boeing 737 MAX briefing on Monday about the steps needed to return the grounded passenger jet to flight after two fatal crashes.
