Congressional investigators are now looking into the administration\u2019s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine for damaging information about Biden, based on unsubstantiated allegations that he used his power as vice president during the Obama administration to kill an investigation into a gas company on whose board his son served. (In fact, Biden and others pushed the Ukrainian government to remove a top prosecutor for not pursuing corruption cases aggressively enough.)\n\nYovanovitch was the subject of an attempted smear campaign earlier this year by Trump allies who sent a packet of documents with misinformation about her to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Conservative media outlets and the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., have also accused her of being part of an alleged Ukrainian attempt to support Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign \u2015 a claim she vehemently denied on Friday.\n\nDuring their July 25 phone call, President Trump ominously told Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky that Yovanovitch was \u201cgoing to go through some things\u201d in the aftermath of her removal from the ambassador\u2019s post.\n\nIn a joint statement on Friday, Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said their panels learned Thursday evening that the White House had directed the State Department to tell Yovanovitch not to appear before House investigators.\n\n\u201cThis is the latest example of the Administration\u2019s efforts to conceal the facts from the American people and obstruct our lawful and constitutionally-authorized impeachment inquiry,\u201d said the three chairmen of committees conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee subsequently issued a subpoena, they said, with which Yovanovitch complied. \u201cAny efforts by Trump Administration officials to prevent witness cooperation with the Committees will be deemed obstruction of a co-equal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the President on the underlying allegations of corruption and coverup,\u201d the chairmen said.\n\nYovanovitch on Friday warned that her ouster and other recent events could signal larger problems at the State Department and for American diplomacy generally.\n\n\u201cToday, we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,\u201d she said.", "description": "U.S. diplomat Marie Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators she was attacked \"by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d", "authors": ["Antonia Blumberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KAPXHyMvJ6qa9y4BAjOtHQ--~B/aD0zMDEyO3c9NDUxNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da0af43210000c008acd0a6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
