The service will end early next year.\n\nVue\u2019s gimmick was that, like Sling TV, you could pay only for the channels you wanted. It was primarily aimed at PlayStation 4 users, a compliment to PS4\u2019s suite of other entertainment options. While it might have seemed like a bargain when it first debuted, Sony\u2018s pushed the price up and up. Most recently, it pushed the price up by $5 this July, blaming it on \u201ccosts rising each year.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a scent of bitterness in the announcement, as John Kodera, Deputy President of Sony Interactive Entertainment says: \u201cUnfortunately, the highly competitive Pay TV industry, with expensive content and network deals, has been slower to change than we expected. Because of this, we have decided to remain focused on our core gaming business.\u201d He later adds, \u201cWe had ambitious goals for how our service could change how people watch TV, showcasing PlayStation\u2019s ability to innovate in a brand-new category within the Pay TV industry.\u201d\n\nThis clearly wasn\u2019t as successful an experiment as Sony would have liked. Recent scuttlebutt has it that the company was looking for a buyer for Vue, but no one was nibbling. The Information reports Sony approached FuboTV, another such service, as a potential buyer, but no dice. The sale would have included a 500,000-household subscriber list \u2014 which doesn\u2019t seem like a lot to me. Then again, Vue hasn\u2019t been as big of a staple of the PlayStation brand recently as, say, PlayStation Now.\n\nMovies and TV content will still be available to PlayStation users via apps like Netflix and such. But if you\u2019re one of the people who was using Vue as a standalone service, then you\u2019re out of luck. There are alternatives, but given how Vue slipped into the red despite having the backing of such a big corporation as Sony, it kind of raises questions about how long the other services are going to last.\n\nPlayStation Vue service officially shuts off on January 30, 2020.\n\nRead next: Jack Dorsey: Twitter will stop all political ads next month", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F09%2Fplaystation-vue-.jpg&signature=399913e88c4d137eb7eed8f053bd94ab", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
