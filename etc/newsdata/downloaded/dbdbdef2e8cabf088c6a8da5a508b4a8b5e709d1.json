After my smartphone, it\u2019s my most frequently used piece of tech. It was also released four years ago. Can you guess what it is?\n\nThe mystery gizmo is a used Kindle e-book reader from 2015, which I bought on eBay from a repair technician. It lacks frills that some new e-readers have, like waterproofing, but I\u2019m not the type to read in the bathtub. So I decided to be a late adopter, and I couldn\u2019t be happier: The dated Kindle does its job well and if I ever break or lose it, I\u2019ll be out 50 bucks and not $200 (\u00a3166).\n\nI\u2019m neither a Luddite nor a cheapskate. But after testing hundreds of tech products \u2013 and buying some along the way \u2013 over the past dozen years, I\u2019ve come to a conclusion: people will almost always get more joy from technology the longer they wait for it to mature. Cutting-edge gadgets can invoke awe and temptation, but being an early adopter involves risk, and the downsides usually outweigh the benefits.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nKeep this in mind when, starting next month, we enter the end-of-the-year tech frenzy. That\u2019s when companies like Apple, Samsung and Google will try to woo us with hot new gadgets, including premium smartphones, tablets and wearable computers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But my default recommendation is to resist hitting the \u201cbuy\u201d button and to wait unless you absolutely need to replace your older tech.\n\n\u201cNew doesn\u2019t always necessarily mean better, or better in ways that will matter,\u201d says Nick Guy, a senior staff writer for Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests products.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at when slow adoption was wise \u2013 and fast adoption a mistake \u2013 followed by a look ahead at brand-new tech to be cautious about.\n\nHow I learned from the pain of being early\n\nIn 2007, I caved and bought Apple\u2019s original iPhone. Having a fully functional web browser on a mobile device was too tempting and as someone with a lousy sense of direction, I wanted the maps. So that winter, I paid the US telecommunications company AT&T $600 (\u00a3498) for the iPhone with a two-year contract. For a while, I relished being among the privileged few to live in the future.\n\nThat special feeling faded about six months later when Apple released the second-generation iPhone. Not only did the new model connect with 3G, a much faster cellular technology at the time, but it started at just $200 (\u00a3166) with a contract. Ouch.\n\nI\u2019ve gone through a handful of iPhones since, but that experience taught me a valuable lesson about the cost of early adoption. Nowadays, whenever Apple makes major changes to iPhones, I wait at least a year for it to iterate the tech and release the S version. (For example, instead of buying the iPhone 5 in 2012, I waited until 2013 to buy the iPhone 5S, which was faster and more durable.)\n\nWirecutter took a similarly cautious approach with the iPhone X, Apple\u2019s first radically redesigned smartphone, with a $1,000 (\u00a3831) price tag. When the device was released in 2017, Wirecutter gave it a positive review but encouraged people not to upgrade because Apple was likely to include the premium features in cheaper models the next year.\n\n\u201cWe said everything seems to work well, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth this price now,\u201d Guy says. \u201cIf you like the iPhone X, wait a year or two and see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe next year, Apple released the $750 (\u00a3623) iPhone XR, which was just as capable as (and in some ways better than) the iPhone X.\n\nWe\u2019re in the golden age of smartphones. Your smartphone from two years ago still works great and will continue to work for a while\n\nKyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, which sells parts and publishes instructions on repairing devices, says people had previously upgraded to new phones every 18 months on average, but could now wait more than three years. That\u2019s because smartphones have reached a point where their improvements aren\u2019t as noticeable year after year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the golden age of smartphones,\u201d he says. \u201cYour smartphone from two years ago still works great and will continue to work for a while.\u201d\n\nPsst, want to buy an old watch? Sure!\n\nMy waiting more than a decade to buy a Kindle is an extreme example of late adoption. There are other, newer examples highlighting the advantages to this approach.\n\nMy second-best gadget purchase this year was the Apple Watch Series 3. When Apple released that watch in 2017, it cost $330 (\u00a3274). This year, retailers like Amazon and Best Buy slashed the price to $200 (\u00a3166). Apple sells the newest version of the watch, Series 4, for $400 (\u00a3332), and its main improvement is a bigger display \u2013 a feature I can live without because I don\u2019t often look at the watch screen.\n\nIn other words, by waiting and opting for a previous-generation model, I get to enjoy a fast, long-lasting watch that tracks my workouts and shows my calendar notifications, among other perks, for a steep discount.\n\nThe late adopter approach goes beyond tech, Wiens says. In the automobile industry, carmakers occasionally revamp models with new driving technology and chassis designs. Then they build on that same design for several years.\n\n\u201cWith cars you never want to buy the first car of a new generation,\u201d Wiens says. \u201cWhen they radically change it, there\u2019s all kinds of issues.\u201d\n\nA case in point: when I shopped for a car in 2013, I bought a used Toyota Prius hybrid from 2011, the year after Toyota released a redesign of the Prius. This generation also came with a price cut, so I got what had previously been a luxury vehicle for a modest price.\n\nWhat to look out for this autumn\n\nThe question that I, as a tech reviewer, hear most often from friends and colleagues is whether they should buy the new (insert gadget name here). But using the approach I\u2019ve described, you can develop an intuition for when it\u2019s a smart time to upgrade \u2013 and when it\u2019s risky.\n\nLet\u2019s say that in the coming weeks, Apple releases a new entry-level iPhone and Google releases a new Pixel smartphone.\n\nSince Apple did its last big redesign of the iPhone in 2017, the next one is likely to be an incremental update. As for Google, its Pixel phones are usually modest upgrades that focus on software enhancements.\n\nIf your current iPhone or Google Pixel is on the fritz, this year may be a good time to upgrade, assuming the new phones get positive reviews. (Or, if you\u2019re like me, you could consider last year\u2019s models when their prices drop after the new ones come out this year.)\n\nIn contrast, a brand new Samsung phone coming out in September screams, \u201cBuyer, beware\u201d. That is the Galaxy Fold, which is the first smartphone that can be folded and unfolded like a book to decrease or increase its screen size. Samsung postponed the release after early samples broke in reviewers\u2019 hands in April.\n\nSamsung said it had since improved the Fold\u2019s design and construction. But with a tarnished reputation and a nearly $2,000 (\u00a31,663) price, it is likely to become a hallmark example of a risky bet for early adopters.\n\nThe wisest thing we can do is pay attention to foldable screens and how they may benefit us in a few years \u2013 but probably not tomorrow.\n\n\u00a9 New York Times", "description": "The best gadget that I bought this year cost less than a week\u2019s worth of groceries.
