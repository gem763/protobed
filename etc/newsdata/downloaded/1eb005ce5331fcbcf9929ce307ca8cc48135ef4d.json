REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov\n\nChief Executive Arkady Volozh said on Friday\u2019s call that the initial version of a draft law aimed at limiting foreign shareholding in Russian IT firms was \u201cvery damaging\u201d, saying the company was in discussions with the government over the proposals.\n\n\u201cAs we look to address national interests, we want to do so in a way that supports our own business interests and the interests of all of our stakeholders,\u201d Volozh said, adding that he remained \u201cextremely committed\u201d to Yandex and will continue to lead it.\n\nHe added that, should the draft legislation become law, Yandex would \u201crecognise the importance of ensuring that shareholders\u2019 economic interests are not diluted\u201d.\n\nHe did not provide other details of a possible plan.\n\nYandex shares were down 1.2% as of 1452 GMT, compared to a drop in the wider index of 0.5%. They have been under pressure since reports emerged in July of the draft law to cap foreign voting power in the company at 20%.\n\nShares had seemed to be paring losses after the government last weekend revised proposals on the cap to just under 50%.\n\nVTB equities analyst Vladimir Bespalov said ongoing uncertainty surrounding the bill was still having a negative effect on Yandex\u2019s share dynamics, despite the results showing strong business growth.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s statements on this issue during the conference call did not provide any clarity,\u201d he said.\n\nCONTINUED GROWTH\n\nThe company, often referred to as \u201cRussia\u2019s Google\u201d for its wide range of online services, on Friday lifted its guidance for growth in rouble-based revenues, excluding its online commerce site Yandex.Market, to 36-38% from a previous forecast of 32-36%.\n\nThird-quarter revenue grew 38% year-on-year to 45 billion roubles ($704.89 million), its earnings statement showed, while adjusted net income rose 12% to 6.9 billion roubles.\n\nRevenues in Yandex\u2019s taxi segment jumped 89%, accounting for a fifth of total revenues, supported by a higher number of rides and growth in its corporate taxi offering.\n\nYandex.Drive, the company\u2019s car-sharing service, also contributed strong growth, becoming the world\u2019s second-largest car-sharing service, according to Volozh.\n\nYandex will begin testing its driverless cars in the United States next summer.\n\nAdjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 29% year-on-year to 13.9 billion roubles.\n\nThe rate of growth in the taxi segment and adjusted net income was slower than in the second quarter. Yandex Chief Operating Officer Greg Abovsky had predicted slower taxi segment growth in July.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Arkady Volozh, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Yandex Group of Companies, attends a session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), Russia June 7, 2019.
