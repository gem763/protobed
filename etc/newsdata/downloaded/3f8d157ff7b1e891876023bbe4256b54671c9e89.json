He makes near-daily verbal miscues about matters trivial and weighty that can often undermine his own campaign.\n\nYet after Thursday\u2019s third debate, the former vice president\u2019s standing in the race appears as durable as ever, with none of his opponents quite sure how to attack him. None of their efforts so far has reshaped the race, and on Friday, Democratic candidates waded into a delicate discussion about Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity that could just as easily backfire on those raising the questions as it could on 76-year-old Biden.\n\nSeeking to deflect concerns, Biden responded on Friday by committing to release his medical records within the next several months, before Democratic primary voters begin selecting their nominee. Then, as a joking profession of strength, he challenged a reporter to wrestle. Biden had surgery three decades ago to repair two brain aneurysms, and records released in 2008 showed he made a full recovery.\n\n\u201cBefore there\u2019s a first vote, I\u2019ll release my medical records,\u201d Biden said, adding that he will do so after his next physical. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me not to release my medical records.\u201d\n\nReleasing his medical records could further insulate him from questions about his age, a topic that his rivals have started raising more prominently in recent days. Two other candidates are in their 70s; an aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said late Friday that Warren, 70, also would release her records before the first voting. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is 78, has not yet fully committed to releasing his.\n\nFor Biden and the party he seeks to lead, questions about his stamina and fitness strike at the heart of the theory he has pushed to voters, so far successfully: that he would be the nominee best equipped to battle President Trump in the general election. Any physical vulnerability would threaten to undermine that perception of electability, a voter viewpoint that has frustrated his Democratic opponents. President Trump has sought to raise questions about Biden\u2019s vitality by characterizing him as \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d\n\nThe debate and its aftermath marked a new phase for the campaign, as it heads into a crucial stretch this fall, with what has felt like a rollicking and unpredictable primary race beginning to stabilize.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden went into the debate as the front-runner and Joe Biden came out of the debate as the front-runner,\u201d said Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and a onetime party chairman who is neutral in the race.\n\nThe numerous attacks on Biden have not landed, he said, because \u201cwe all know Joe. Joe Biden has been in this a very long time. People love Joe Biden. And honestly, people don\u2019t want to see them attacking President Obama\u2019s record.\u201d\n\nThe other candidates also have attempted a delicate dance: praising President Obama while trying to criticize Biden\u2019s record within the administration. But so far Biden has easily dispatched those critiques by hugging closely the most popular figure in the party.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who in the first debate launched the most biting attack on Biden for his decades-long opposition to mandated busing as a way to integrate schools, has since recalibrated to focus her attention largely on Trump. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has attempted to ridicule Biden for a crime bill that led to mass incarceration, while Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said he was weak on women\u2019s rights. Neither of the first two attacks boosted the senators; Gillibrand left the race soon after her critique.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s debate, former Obama administration housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro made an aggressive attempt to highlight Biden\u2019s mental acumen by repeatedly suggesting that he had forgotten something that he\u2019d said just two minutes earlier. But Castro was off on his facts, stifling the potential damage he could inflict, even as other candidates began raising similar concerns.\n\n\u201cI think that we are at a tough point right now, because there\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\u201d Booker said during a CNN interview after the debate, adding that Castro raised \u201creally legitimate concerns.\u201d\n\nWhile Booker said he did not think Biden was too old to be president, he said, \u201cThere are definitely moments when you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.\u201d\n\nAsked Friday in Houston how he can prove his abilities to rivals \u2014 and voters \u2014 Biden replied, \u201cI carry the ball over the finish line.\u201d But he also said that questions about the impact of his age were fair game.\n\nOther candidates were squeamish about the direction of the discussion, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) calling Castro\u2019s criticism \u201cso personal and so unnecessary\u201d and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.) saying, \u201cThat kind of personal attack, I don\u2019t think, is what we need right now and is insufficient to the challenges we face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought Castro\u2019s attacks were ludicrous,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful to the party to have Democrats chewing on each other this way. The thing I worry about is when people watched that and saw it they probably turned it off and said, \u2018I\u2019m sick of this.\u2019 We need a positive message.\u201d\n\nCastro sent out a fundraising email Friday, saying he was being \u201cviciously attacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could either play it safe and give Vice President Biden a free pass like everyone else,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOr I could speak up.\u201d\n\nBiden campaign advisers said Castro\u2019s attack was \u201ca cheap shot\u201d and pointed out that past attacks on him have not worked out for the attacker.\n\nThe Biden campaign acknowledges that Biden misspeaks with frequency, and aides attempt to dispel the idea that it is a result of age by pointing to a string of gaffes that goes back decades. They have viewed it as a quality that gives him some measure of authenticity, with one adviser saying, \u201cThe biggest mistake we could make as a campaign is to not let Joe Biden be Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the gaffes are already baked into the cake. Democrats know his flaws \u2014 but right or wrong \u2014 the belief remains for now that he\u2019s the person on the stage who can win,\u201d said Glen Caplin, a Democratic strategist who was a top adviser to Gillibrand\u2019s campaign. \u201cAnd that right now is the altar a lot of people are praying at. Until that core argument of his campaign \u2014 he is the electable one \u2014 is shaken, the dynamic of the race will probably be the dynamic of the race for a while.\u201d\n\nIronically, considering Trump\u2019s criticisms of the former vice president, the parameters of the Democratic race are reminiscent of the Republican primary campaign in 2016, during which rival campaigns assumed to their detriment that Donald Trump was flawed and would eventually collapse on his own.\n\nBiden\u2019s performance in the debate reminded voters of the promise and peril of his candidacy. He was strong in its early portions, eager to defend his health-care plan and feisty as he pointed toward the high costs associated with the Medicare-for-all proposal pushed by Sanders and Warren. Biden also closed the evening by retelling the emotional story about the death of his wife and daughter death in a car accident in 1972, and the death of his son in 2015.\n\nBut he still made misstatements (\u201cNobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime,\u201d he said, when he meant nonviolent drug offenses). He meandered on several answers, quickly jumping around to various unrelated topics.\n\nBiden\u2019s clumsy way of talking about race also was highlighted.\n\nHe was asked on Thursday night to respond to a comment he made in 1975, which The Post resurrected earlier this year, when he spoke about segregation by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation. And I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\u201d\n\nBiden began his response by talking about the need to increase teacher salaries, and to hire more school psychologists who can meet needs that aren\u2019t being met at home. He then said social workers are needed in some cases because poor parents need help raising their children.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know quite what to do,\u201d Biden said. \u201cPlay the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player \u2014 on at night, make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background \u2014 will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\u201d\n\nGiven that the question was about repairing the legacy of slavery, some viewed Biden\u2019s answer as being critical of black parents.\n\nHe then transitioned away from education to talk about Venezuela, how he knew and had confronted President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and had tried to improve conditions in Latin America.\n\nThe next speaker suggested he was at a loss to respond.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a lot.\u201d\n\nAnnie Linskey contributed to this report.", "description": "The 76-year-old former vice president said Friday he will release his medical records before the first votes are cast next year.", "authors": ["Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kDGeoxFccL01OtXfjOjFoFRGcCY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QNT4VXGWOQI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
