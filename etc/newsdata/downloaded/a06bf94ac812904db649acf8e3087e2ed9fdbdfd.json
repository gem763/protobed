There is no way our parliaments will accept this,' one diplomat said.\n\nGermany is one of the so-called 'frugal five' countries who are entitled to a rebate, along with Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.\n\nHowever, that rebate could be abolished under the new budget, with the British rebate agreed by Margaret Thatcher set to fall away in any case.\n\nGermany, which is Europe's largest economy, is already the largest contributor to the EU's coffers in gross terms.\n\nEU leaders clashed over a proposed \u00a31trillion EU budget at the Brussels summit where a new Brexit deal was agreed earlier this month.\n\nTalks: European leaders - pictured together at an EU summit in Brussels - will have to agree a new budget for 2021-27, expected to be the bloc's first after Britain leaves\n\nThe proposal clashes with a German demand that the EU budget take up no more than one per cent of the bloc's GDP.\n\nThe European Parliament wants a bigger budget, set at 1.3 per cent of the EU's economic output.\n\nPlans to cut spending on farmers and poorer regions have also caused anger among some member states.\n\n'The text has caused nearly unanimous dissatisfaction,' a diplomat involved in the talks in Brussels said.\n\nOn top of that, the new budget would also include rules that would suspend funding to member states with rule-of-law shortcomings.\n\nThat is irking states such as Poland and Hungary, who have been accused of breaching the rule of law after controversial judiciary and media reforms.\n\nEU officials hope to reach an agreement by the end of this year but they have yet to rid themselves of the Brexit issue.\n\nA new Brexit delay until January 31 was finalised earlier this year and there is no certainty that the UK election will bring clarity.", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured) has told her fellow EU leaders that the projected rise would make Germany the largest per-capita contributor, overtaking the Netherlands.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/08/20364526-0-image-a-7_1572424378766.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
