Simply put, eligible voters must show up to a poll on election day. Once there, they can cast their vote for a candidate, select \"none of the above\" or even submit a blank ballot.\n\nElection day is typically held on the weekend, ensuring the majority of voters can make it to a poll. (David Gray/Reuters)\n\nThat's led to high voter turnout in the country. During a federal election in May, nearly 91 per cent of eligible voters turned up to polls.\n\n\"I think it's a brilliant thing that people in Australia [do],\" said Keiran Kelly who hails from Adelaide, but now lives in London, U.K.\n\n\"Everyone gets to take part in the democracy process. It's something you grow up with.\"\n\nNot low enough\n\nOver the years, citizens and politicians alike have called on the Canadian government to make voting mandatory with little success.\n\nBut according to University of Ottawa constitutional law professor Michael Pal, turnout hasn't been low enough for governments to take it seriously.\n\n\"Once we have an election where turnout starts getting close to 50 per cent, or below 50 per cent ... then mandatory voting will become a big policy issue,\" Pal said in an interview.\n\nWe've had a long tradition of \u2026 letting people decide if they want to cast a vote or not. - Michael Pal, constitutional law professor\n\nIn 2017, after pledging to consider the issue during the 2015 federal election campaign \u2014 an election that saw 68 per cent of eligible voters hit the polls \u2014 the Liberal government said they wouldn't move forward with changes.\n\n\"You'd have to pass an amendment to the Canada Elections Act, and there might be political hurdles in passing it through Parliament,\" Pal said.\n\n\"But the biggest challenge is probably not political will as much as the constitution.\"\n\nPal says that while the Charter of Rights and Freedoms grants us the right to vote, it doesn't grant the right to skip the ballot.\n\nThe right to not vote would ensure eligible voters, including some Indigenous people who conscientiously object to the federal government, have a legal exemption.\n\nIn Australia, those who skip the vote must provide a reason for their absence \u2014 sickness, religious exemption or conscientious objection are all accepted \u2014 or pay a small fine, typically amounting to less than $20.\n\nA similar model could work in Canada, Pal says, adding that any penalties must be low to ensure voters who simply couldn't make it out aren't unduly burdened.\n\nElection day holiday?\n\nStill, for mandatory voting to work the government would need to make polls as accessible as possible, Pal says.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean Elections Canada needs to fire up a grill or offer pony rides, however.\n\nVoters in Australia can turn up at any polling location \u2014 not only one near their registered home address \u2014 to cast their ballot, for example.\n\nWhile advocates say that mandatory voting could improve turnout in Canada, Michael Pal believes making voting easier is key. (Michael Wilson/CBC)\n\nOthers, including Pal, have suggested election day could become a federal holiday, but perhaps simpler, is to offer greater access to advance polls.\n\nThis week, Elections Canada reported a 29 per cent increase in votes cast during advance polls. This election featured 1,200 more early polling locations compared to 2015.\n\nUltimately, Pal says that mandatory voting is a \"second-best option.\"\n\n\"We've had a long tradition of \u2026 letting people decide if they want to cast a vote or not,\" Pal said.\n\n\"More voter turnout is better than lower voter turnout, but giving people the choice is a good thing.\"", "description": "Australians vote on Saturdays.
