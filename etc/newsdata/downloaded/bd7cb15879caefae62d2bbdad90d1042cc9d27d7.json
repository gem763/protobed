The spread of machair \u2013 a grassland thick with flowers in summer \u2013 moorland and rock is much loved by walkers and birdwatchers.\n\nIt is home to breeding colonies of cormorants and black guillemots as well as seals, otters and the occasional hen harrier. On the horizon to the west, the dramatic islands of St Kilda are just visible, otherwise there is nothing but the Atlantic.\n\nBut a storm is brewing that is casting a deep cloud over the community, as fears grow about plans to build the UK\u2019s first spaceport in the middle of this stunning coastline, dividing the 1,200 people who live on the Hebridean island.\n\nMany fear that rockets blasting satellites into space from Spaceport 1 could shatter the calm of the island and terrify its rare wildlife. In consultation meetings last week in North Uist, locals raised their fears about the environmental impact as well as asking about the economic benefits.\n\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has now added its voice to the growing chorus of objections, warning that the chosen site is in a \u201chighly sensitive area\u201d. Scolpaig is part of a national scenic area, a designation that defines it as one of Scotland\u2019s 40 finest landscapes. It also sits adjacent to several special protection areas designated for their significance for birds. A major RSPB bird reserve, Balranald, is within 2km. Corncrakes, Greenland barnacle geese and ringed plover are just a few of the many species living in the area.\n\nMore than 600 representations have been made to the Western Isles council (Comhairle nan Eilean Siar), the vast majority objecting to the plan to build what is described as the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of a spaceport to launch research rockets. Subsequent phases would involve further expansion to cater to the expanding global market for satellite launches. Locals fear that the industrial infrastructure and noise disturbance will damage the island\u2019s reputation as one of Europe\u2019s last great wildernesses.\n\nWe\u2019re sceptical of the promise of jobs for locals \u2026 We fear the militarisation of a precious landscape Angus McNab\n\n\u201cThis is a superbly beautiful area and tourism is a major source of income and jobs. It doesn\u2019t need this kind of industrial development,\u201d says Angus McNab, a resident and one of the founders of the protest group Friends of Scolpaig.\n\nBehind the spaceport application is a consortium that includes the council and the Highlands and Islands Enterprise agency (HIE), as well as the military contractor QinetiQ which already runs a missile firing range in nearby South Uist with radar tracking from its base on St Kilda. The council has invested \u00a31m in the scheme, buying the land in June, and the HIE has invested nearly \u00a310m.\n\n\u201cThe Uists have a fragile economy heavily dependent on the public sector. Here is a fantastic example of innovation which could bring real benefit to the community,\u201d says Joe McPhee, the council\u2019s head of economic development.\n\nThe consortium promotes itself as offering \u201clow-cost access to space\u201d and is suggesting that the scheme could generate payments of about \u00a3900,000 a year for the islanders and up to 70 jobs. The island is desperate to secure its future after decades of slow but inexorable population decline as young people leave to find work on the mainland, and the population ages. The plan would also help boost Scotland\u2019s growing space industry, says McPhee.\n\nBut McNab says: \u201cWe\u2019re sceptical of the promise of jobs for locals. At one meeting, it was admitted that there would be only eight to 13 jobs on the spaceport itself.\u201d He added that the most skilled jobs were unlikely to be filled by islanders. \u201cWe fear the militarisation of a precious landscape.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Locals on North Uist fear the development of a launch site such as this one on French Guiana.

Although the spaceport is currently proposed as a commercial venture for the launch of satellites with sun-synchronous and polar orbits, there is always the possibility that it could be turned to military use.\n\nIslanders question why the remote site of Scolpaig has been chosen, fearing that it may be because of the risk of damage from unsuccessful launches and intrusive noise. But Mark Roberts, the spaceport\u2019s project director, says that the site, which faces north over the sea, was chosen because of the access it gives to the required orbits. The existing South Uist range would be less viable commercially, he adds.\n\nThe application made in July proposed to start work by the end of the year, provoking complaints that it was being rushed through without the usual environmental assessments. But concern from environmental bodies has forced delays and the council is to conduct tests on the fragile peat moorland next week, and has begun surveys on the local birdlife.\n\nWhat has alarmed protesters is that the council is both part of the consortium and the deciding authority on the application. The consortium maintains that a full environmental impact assessment is not required at this stage given the small scale of work planned for this phase.\n\nHowever, the concern is that the noise of the launches could affect wildlife, and the construction of roads, launchpads and an assembly point in which to construct the rockets will destroy rare habitats.\n\nClose by the proposed launch site, a picturesque tower stands on an islet in Loch Scolpaig, a 19th-century folly built to provide employment for islanders during the potato famine. Constructed on the ruins of an Iron Age fort, the tower is just one of a number of archaeological remains that could be damaged by vibrations.\n\n\u201cOur unique selling point as an island is our natural environment and archaeology and this proposal will leave this lovely area desolate,\u201d says Mairi Morrison, a member of the local history society. \u201cHuge sums are being invested in a project with dubious benefits instead of into the small-scale social enterprises that are better suited to serve the island\u2019s future.\u201d", "description": "North Uist could be home to a new rocket site \u2013 but islanders say it would damage important habitats", "authors": ["Madeleine Bunting"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3cc42f3763045750fdafb84402562c3c878ae3d/0_246_5598_3359/master/5598.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e67aa7e361440e074c286bc121e35b65", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
