Tulsi Gabbard received support from a handful of her fellow Democratic presidential candidates this weekend after she was apparently accused of being a Russian asset.\n\n\u201cTulsi is not being groomed by anyone. She is her own person,\u201d former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke said, according to a video posted by The Hill. \u201cObviously has served this country, continues to serve this country in uniform, in Congress, as a candidate for presidency so I think those facts speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Hawaii Democrat also received kind words on social media from both Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang.\n\nOn Friday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seemed to suggest that Ms. Gabbard, who serves in the National Guard, was being groomed by the Russians to be a third-party candidate.\n\nMs. Gabbard shot back on Twitter at the \u201cqueen of warmongers,\u201d accusing the former Secretary of State of orchestrating a \u201cconcerted campaign to destroy my reputation.\u201d\n\nOthers have avoided getting into the Twitter feud.\n\nIndiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union Sunday that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with Ms. Clinton\u2019s comment but also didn\u2019t want to get in the middle of their fight.\n\nHe said the main focus should be on Russia\u2019s attempts to insert themselves in 2020 elections.\n\n\u201cRussia is working to interfere with our elections right now. We know a big part of how they\u2019re going to do it is exploiting divisions,\u201d he said.\n\nSens. Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar reportedly brushed off questions about the exchange, and Sen. Cory Booker reacted by retweeting Ms. Gabbard\u2019s response with a gif of his stunned face at the first Democratic primary debate.\n\nIn an interview with NBC news, Ms. Gabbard said Russian reactions to her platform is out of her control.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t control what anyone says or does. All I can do is focus on the message that I am bringing to this campaign,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
