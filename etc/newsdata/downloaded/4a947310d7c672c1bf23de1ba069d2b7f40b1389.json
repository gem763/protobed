Gemma does this trick all the time.\n\n\u201cShe has been able to do it since birth, she's a weirdo.\"\n\nGemma has a condition called hypermobility, meaning her joints are much more flexible than the average person.\n\nThe project coordinator says she feels no pain at all showing off her special talent.\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\nShe said: \"I realised I could move my joints because I was the only one in my classroom that could bend in such ways when asking miss a question.\n\n\"My doctor tells me it's bad for my joints but I think they're just jealous.\n\n\u201cI'm a super hero - my power is bendy elbows.\u201d\n\nGemma even practises daily in order to get her elbows to bend at different angles.\n\nShe added: \"I actually practise quite a lot. Maybe twice daily for about 15 minutes a time. Perfection is persistence.\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\n\u201cMy hips and legs are hyper mobile as well but not as much as my elbows.\n\n\"It's hard not to do it in public! if you had a super power like mine, you'd use it no?\n\n\u201cMy family and friends think it's a bit weird but normal is boring right?\u201d", "description": "During a night out in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, she took drastic action by performing her go-to party trick", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Jam Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703728.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Jampress_bendy_elbow_008JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
