That compared with a preliminary reading of 1.8%. The revised figure matched analysts\u2019 median estimate.\n\nEconomists had expected overall growth to be smaller than first estimated after finance ministry figures released last week showed manufacturers cutting back on business investment as escalating trade tensions darken the global outlook. That contrasts with the stance of more domestic-oriented non-manufacturers, which are continuing to ramp up capital spending as they automate processes to cope with a labor shortage.\n\nKey Insights\n\nConsumer spending has helped power growth this year as exports have fallen due to a slowing global economy and the U.S.-China trade war. Private spending is expected to continue showing strength through the third quarter, before taking a hit from a sales-tax increase in October.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war is casting a shadow over the global outlook, and by extension the prospects for continued growth in Japan\u2019s trade-dependent economy. Japan is also keen to clinch a trade deal with the U.S. that would avert tariffs on auto imports.\n\nStill, Japan\u2019s economy has continued to expand despite gloomy forecasts from economists expecting the global slowdown to buckle growth. While the export sector and manufacturers are showing signs of strain, domestic demand and investment by non-manufacturers remain solid for now.\n\nThe latest growth data come ahead of a Bank of Japan policy meeting next week where some economists are expecting the central bank to take further easing action to ward off any rises in the yen that could hit companies\u2019 profits and invite downward pressure on prices.\n\nThe growth figures show the economy is holding up while financial markets and the yen remain relatively stable, said Kazuma Maeda, economist at Barclays (LON: ) Securities. \u201cEven possible action by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve seems priced in to markets. Considering all these points I think the BOJ will choose not to waste any policy ammunition at the September meeting.\u201d\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, fiscal stimulus and last-minute consumption ahead of the sales-tax increase are likely to support modest growth in 3Q. But the risks are to the downside. The U.S.-China trade war threatens to damp exports. Risk-off sentiment could push up the yen -- cutting into Japan\u2019s competitiveness and damping inflation.\u201d\n\n--Asia Economist TeamClick here the view the piece.\n\nGet More", "description": "Japan\u2019s Economy Grows at Slower Pace as Capex Proves Less Strong", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic436a4a31e53d8bb17b738f19ca97590e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
