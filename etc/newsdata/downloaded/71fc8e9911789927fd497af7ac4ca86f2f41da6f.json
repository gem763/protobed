REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nZURICH (Reuters) - Logitech International (LOGN.S) said its gaming business had not run out of steam despite seeing its sales of its peripherals for gamers increasing by only 2% during its latest quarter, Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S.-Swiss company was now lapping tough comparisons with last year when the success of the Fortnite game led to a surge in sales of gaming headphones by fans of the multi-player shoot-em up, Darrell told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWhat you are seeing is the famous Fortnite effect from last year, that was huge,\u201d Darrell said. \u201cIf you take the headset business out, where the business was affected the most, we continue to grow double digits,\u201d Darrell said, referring to keyboards and mice Logitech also makes for gamers.\n\nThe tough comparisons would start to fade away at the start of next year, Darrell said, while the success of Logitech\u2019s gaming business did not rely on single games like Fortnite.\n\n\u201cThere are so many games that are popular, we are a little less dependent on a single one,\u201d he said. \u201cInterest in gaming continues to grow, it\u2019s a truly global phenomenon.\u201d\n\nThe executive was speaking after Logitech posted a 4.5% increase in operating income during its latest quarter, driven by a strong uptake of its video conferencing products and confirmed its full year guidance.\n\nVideo collaboration was a long term growth story, Darrell said, with companies using it to save costs and the environmental impact of flying staff to meetings.", "description": "Logitech International said its gaming business had not run out of steam despite seeing its sales of its peripherals for gamers increasing by only 2% during its latest quarter, Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443732712&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L12J", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
