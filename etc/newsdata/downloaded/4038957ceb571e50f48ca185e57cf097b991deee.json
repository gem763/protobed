An Amazon seller is offering this Halloween mask that's supposedly meant to be the character Sloth from The Goonies\n\nThe real one: Sloth has a disfigured head because he was dropped as a baby\n\nThe very discomfiting mask is in the shape of a pair of buttocks, cut off at the lower back and upper legs.\n\nBut why? The very discomfiting mask is in the shape of a pair of buttocks, cut off at the lower back and upper legs\n\nThere is a crack down the middle, and two eyes have been added on either side of it.\n\nThe eyes, startlingly, have flesh-colored eyebrows but no eyelashes.\n\nThere is no nose, but an open, thin-lipped mouth situated at the bottom of the crack.\n\nIt's sold by the company YYF with the product name 'YYF Latex Mask Rubber Creepy Ugly Hip Head The Goonies Sloth Mask Halloween Party Costume Decorations' for $20.89.\n\nThe mask doesn't appear to be terribly popular and has just one review \u2014 but after it caught the attention of comedian Ted Travelstead, it's raised the eyebrows of thousands of people on Twitter.\n\nYikes! After it caught the attention of comedian Ted Travelstead, it's raised the eyebrows of thousands of people on Twitter\n\nCracking up! Several people figured that a seller had a surplus of butt masks and got creative\n\nCould've gone without it... Many just found it flat-out disturbing\n\nEw: Some pointed out specific parts of the description, like that it's made from 'natural emulsion'\n\nSo many ways to wear it! This person thinks it's funny that it's suitable for 'all kinds' of theme parties\n\nSome made Goonies jokes, referencing Sloth's love of Baby Ruth candy bars\n\n'Pairs well with one eyed willie,' quipped one, referencing the name of the pirate who inspired the children in the movie to go hunting for treasure\n\nTed imagine a person wearing the mask being escorted out of a bar or party, presumably by police: '\"I don't know what you're talking about. I'm clearly Sloth from The Goonies. Let go of me!'\n\nDoesn't look like him to us! Fans of the 1985 film are quite confused\n\nOthers shared their own thoughts, including how they think the mask got made in the first place.\n\n'When your a** masks aren\u2019t selling well so you change them up a little to appeal to a different market,' wrote one.\n\n'Somebody clearly had some sort of production issue with a sex toy and tried to find a way to salvage the lot,' added another.\n\nSome made Goonies jokes, referencing Sloth's love of Baby Ruth candy bars.\n\n'Pairs well with one eyed willie,' quipped another, referencing the name of the pirate who inspired the children in the movie to go hunting for treasure.\n\nThere were also those who mocked the description for the item, pointing out that the 'color' is listed as 'funny' and it's 'suitable for all kinds of theme party.'", "description": "A seller on Amazon is offering a mask it claims is Sloth from The Goonies.
