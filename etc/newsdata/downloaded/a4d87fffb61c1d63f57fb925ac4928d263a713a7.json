Satellite image \u00a92019 Maxar Technologies/Handout via REUTERS\n\nThe vessel, formerly named Grace 1, was seized by British Royal Marine commandos on July 4 on suspicion of being en route to Syria.\n\nGibraltar released it on Aug. 15 after receiving formal written assurances from Tehran that the ship would not discharge its 2.1 million barrels of oil in Syria.\n\nBut Britain\u2019s foreign office said in a statement it was clear Iran had breached those assurances and that the oil had been transferred to Syria.\n\n\u201cIran has shown complete disregard for its own assurances over Adrian Darya 1,\u201d foreign minister Dominic Raab said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThis sale of oil to (Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s) brutal regime is part of a pattern of behaviour by the Government of Iran designed to disrupt regional security.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration last year unilaterally pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and Western powers, and is pursuing a campaign to bring Iran\u2019s exports to zero.\n\nWashington had warned any state against assisting the ship, saying it would consider that support for a terrorist organization, namely, Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Tuesday stopped short of confirming whether Iran had sold the oil to Assad\u2019s regime, but strongly suggested it had.\n\n\u201cAs we have warned all along, the Iranian regime has once again reneged on its assurances to the international community about its intentions to transport illicit oil to the murderous Assad regime,\u201d a department spokeswoman said.\n\nBrian Hook, the State Department\u2019s top official on Iran, sent emails to the Adrian Darya\u2019s captain on Aug. 26, saying the Trump administration was offering him several million dollars to steer the tanker to a country that would impound it on behalf of Washington, a department spokesman confirmed. The emails to the captain, first reported by the Financial Times, were among about a dozen similar communications Hook had with other captains in recent months.\n\nBritain said it had summoned the Iranian ambassador to condemn Iran\u2019s actions and would raise the issue at the United Nations later this month.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s actions represent an unacceptable violation of international norms,\u201d the statement said.", "description": "Britain's foreign minister on Tuesday said Iranian tanker Adrian Darya had sold its crude oil to the Assad regime in Syria, breaking assurances it had given not to sell crude to the country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428363502&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891EB", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
