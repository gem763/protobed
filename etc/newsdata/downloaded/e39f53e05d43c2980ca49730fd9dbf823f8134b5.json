A D.C. police report was filed in January.\n\nAD\n\nNoble\u2019s attorney, Edward J. Ungvarsky, said in a statement that his client \u201cis an honest, beloved and longtime public servant. The charges are false and libelous. We look forward to the vindication of the truth in the court of law.\u201d\n\nThe principal of Beers Elementary, Gwendolyn Payton, said in a letter to parents that she first learned of the allegations from police in January and that Noble was put on leave Jan. 16 and has not been allowed at any school facility.\n\nAD", "description": "Police alleged the abuse occurred in late 2016 and early 2017 at the school in Southeast.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
