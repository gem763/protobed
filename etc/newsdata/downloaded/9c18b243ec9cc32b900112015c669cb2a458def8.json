Roberts had run into an Iranian mine while attempting to extricate herself from a minefield. The blast tore open a 21-foot long hole in her hull and wounded ten sailors. Only a heroic damage control effort kept the frigate afloat.\n\nThis was deemed the last straw after ten months of skirmishes between U.S. ships and Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIt was by then the eighth bloody year of the Iran-Iraq War, in which Iran had taken to attacking commercial shipping in the Gulf in retaliation for Arab support for Iraq.\n\nStarting in June 1987, U.S. ships began escorting commercial convoys in the Gulf under operation \u201cEarnest Will.\u201d Meanwhile, special operators in helicopters caught an Iranian ship at night laying mines and captured a logbook proving Iranian involvement\u2014as recounted in this earlier article.\n\nFollowing the Roberts mining, President Reagan wanted to launch a more punishing retaliation. Attacks on actual Iranian soil were deemed too escalatory. Instead, for Operation Praying Mantis two Iranian oil platforms\u2014used to surveil commercial shipping with their radars and stage motorboat attacks\u2014were marked for termination. And the Sabalan.\n\nThe 1,500-ton Saam-class frigate was one of three built by Vosper in the UK for Iran during the 1970s, and was armed with a rapid-firing 4.5\u201d gun and Italian-built Sea Killer cruise missiles on a stern-mounted launcher (picture here). Using an Iranian modification of the outdated Sea Killer called the Sea Dawn, the frigates had struck six Iraqi merchant ships in a five-month period in 1986-1987.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Influencing public perceptions of Iran's navy to this day.", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zneTDW1C3TzGu1emmahA0A--~B/aD05NDU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/1cf326452c7696da1cb353a8c1a187a7", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
