The charges laid by Usada were really serious and we are now in business mode. The Athletics Integrity Unit has already been in contact with those athletes and they are being asked to sever those relationships.\u201d\n\nThose who will have to change coaches include Sifan Hassan, the world 10,000m champion. When Coe was asked whether the ban reflected poorly on Farah, he said: \u201cAthletes have to have complete and total trust in their coaches and if they don\u2019t the relationship will fray,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if a coach is accused of something an athlete has to ask really detailed questions. You have to assume athletes do that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alberto Salazar has had his accreditation revoked at the world championships in Doha.\n\nHowever Steve Magness, a former member of the Nike Oregon Project, a group that was initially set up to help US endurance athletes beat the best runners from Africa but later recruited Farah, said the British athlete should face questions for deciding to stick with Salazar for two years after Usada launched its investigation in 2015.\n\n\u201cPeople make mistakes but they have to own up and that\u2019s where Farah and a lot of other people who stuck it out have to answer questions,\u201d he said.\n\nJeffrey Brown, who worked as a paid consultant endocrinologist for Nike on performance enhancement and served as a physician for many of Salazar\u2019s athletes, also received a four-year ban. In a statement, Travis Tygart, the CEO of US Anti-Doping, praised the numerous whistleblowers who had come forward and condemned Salazar and Brown\u2019s behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr Salazar and Dr Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect.\u201d But the 61-year-old Salazar said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the outcome and would appeal. \u201cThe Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping,\u201d he said. \u201cThroughout this six-year investigation my athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from Usada.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nFarah was with Salazar for nearly seven years during which time he went from being just outside elite level to virtually unbeatable. He stuck with his famed coach after allegations against Salazar first surfaced in a BBC and ProPublica report in 2015 and left only in 2017. At the time, Farah denied his decision was connected to the doping claims. Usada first brought doping charges against Salazar and Brown in June 2017 in a court battle that was heard behind closed doors. Meanwhile, Nike said that it would back Salazar\u2019s appeal and that Usada\u2019s decision had \u201cnothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sebastian Coe has ordered Alberto Salazar to be stripped of his accreditation at the world championships in Qatar.

We support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require. Nike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner.\u201d\n\nMo Farah's former coach Alberto Salazar gets four-year ban for doping violations Read more\n\nNike is facing questions after emails released by the US Anti-Doping Agency revealed the sportswear company\u2019s chief executive Mark Parker was briefed on Salazar\u2019s experiments to determine whether the use of topical testosterone cream would trigger a positive doping test that were conducted in a laboratory at Nike\u2019s headquarters.\n\nOn a separate occasion Salazar also wrote to Lance Armstrong to recommend he try the amino acid L-carnitine when he was training for an Ironman. \u201cLance, call me asap! We have tested it and it\u2019s amazing! All completely legal and natural. You will finish the Iron Man in about 16 minutes less while taking this.\u201d\n\nArmstrong said in an email to the Wall Street Journal that he never tested or tried L-carnitine.", "description": "The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, has told athletes they must sever their links with Alberto Salazar after he was banned for four years for \u2018orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u2019", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38bc51b393892dc78dc3e37ce563c3417fdb3c20/0_95_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c97ee67f255ecdcb2f6f5571b2a4c62f", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
