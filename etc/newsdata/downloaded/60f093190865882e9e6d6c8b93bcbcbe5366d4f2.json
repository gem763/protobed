It\u2019s unclear exactly how it works.\n\nPeople in the study who ate fish instead of meat, however, had lower risks of heart disease without the increase in stroke.\n\nVisit INSIDER\u2019s homepage for more.\n\nAs meatless diets are becoming increasingly popular, researchers are studying whether they may have unexpected health risks. Case in point: Vegetarians and vegans, while they have lower rates of heart disease, may face a greater risk of stroke, according to a new study published Wednesday in The BMJ.\n\nFor the study, researchers from Oxford University looked at the dietary habits and health of 48,188 adult men and women in the UK over the course of 18 years.\n\nThey found that participants with a plant-based diet, including both vegetarians and vegans, had lower rates of heart disease but higher rates of stroke than meat eaters.\n\nNon-meat-eaters were at a significantly higher risk for a particular kind of stroke \u2013 a hemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when a blood vessel ruptures and begins bleeding into the brain.\n\nPeople who avoided meat but ate fish, however, had a lower risk of heart disease without increasing their risk for stroke. More research is needed to understand just what kind of diet is best for protecting your health.\n\nRead more: Healthy plant-based diet tied to lowered heart risk\n\nLow cholesterol from eating less meat may mean better overall heart health\n\nThe results of this study are consistent with previous research that found a significantly lower risk of heart disease among vegetarians \u2013 as much as 24% lower death rates from heart disease, according to one study.\n\nResearchers suspect this is partly caused by lower levels of cholesterol in the blood, which typically come from a meat-free diet. However, that doesn\u2019t entirely explain the difference, and data suggests eating more fruits, vegetables, legumes, and fiber also provide health benefits.\n\nResearchers also found that vegetarians and vegans were less likely to smoke and more likely to exercise regularly. They also reported lower rates of high blood pressure, cholesterol problems, diabetes, and long-term illnesses.\n\nBut even after adjusting for lifestyle factors like smoking, exercise, and body mass index, vegetarians and vegans still had lower rates of heart disease.\n\nCholesterol and other nutrients in animal protein may protect against brain hemorrhage\n\nThis new research supports earlier findings that low cholesterol levels, though typically thought of as a healthy thing, may somehow cause a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nIn addition to low cholesterol levels, vegetarians and vegans also had lower levels of vitamin B12, vitamin D, and amino acids than meat eaters, which may be related to their higher stroke risk.\n\nResearchers concluded that more studies are needed to test how those nutrients might play a role in preventing strokes.\n\nPeople who ate fish, but not meat, seemed to fare best\n\nPescatarians \u2013 who avoid animal meat but may eat fish, dairy, and eggs \u2013 had the best of both worlds, according to the data. They showed a lower risk of heart disease than meat eaters, but without the higher stroke risk associated with plant-based diets.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to improve your health overall, consider swapping out your steak for salmon, or just incorporating more vegetables overall into your menu.\n\nRead more:\n\nA nutritionist claims vegan diets can stunt brain development, but other health experts say plant-based eating is perfectly healthy\n\nResearchers calculated what would happen if the entire US stopped eating meat.
