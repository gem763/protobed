This was his, you know, biggest kind of trophy.\u2019\n\nAndrew says he first met Epstein in 1999, around the same time he had a brief romance with Lady Victoria. An unnamed friend of Epstein tells the program that the prince\u2019s friendship with the American after his 2009 conviction for having sex with underage girls was \u2018more than a lack of judgment\u2019 and showed hubris.\n\nThe friend added: \u2018You begin to believe you can\u2019t be damaged. You\u2019re beyond being damaged.
