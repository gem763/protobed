Lawmakers have been examining how Trump pushed the Ukrainians to investigate the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, a lawyer and former lobbyist. Those questions are now at the center of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nOnce members of Congress turned their attention to Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, incorrect statements about the former vice president and his son started circulating again in far-right corners of the internet and on social media platforms like Facebook. Mainstream conservative media outlets like Fox News began running with some of the theories and Trump echoed them.\n\nHere are four of the most prominent false or misleading rumors that have spread and an explanation of what really happened (to the extent that we know).\n\nWhy was Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor fired?\n\nThe allegation at the heart of the controversy is that while Biden was vice president, he pushed to have Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor removed for investigating a company connected to Biden\u2019s son Hunter, the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma. Videos pushing this theory began appearing on Twitter in late September and early October and have been viewed tens of millions of times. Trump\u2019s campaign has also asserted the claim in ads on Facebook.\n\nBiden was overseeing U.S. policy toward Ukraine at the time, and he did push for the removal of the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who was seen as corrupt or ineffectual by the United States and Western European governments. But there is no evidence he did so to benefit Hunter Biden or the oligarch who owns Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nIn 2014, Hunter joined the board of Burisma, which was then mired in a corruption scandal. Authorities in Ukraine, Britain and the United States had opened investigations into the company\u2019s operations. Zlochevsky had also been accused of marshaling government contracts to companies he owned and embezzling public money.\n\nAt the time of his board appointment, the younger Biden had just been discharged from the Navy Reserve for drug use. He had no apparent experience in Ukraine or natural gas. And while accepting the board position was legal, it reportedly raised some eyebrows in the Obama administration. The Burisma board position was lucrative: Biden received payments that reached up to $50,000 per month.\n\nA year later, Viktor Shokin became Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, a job similar to the attorney general in the United States. He vowed to keep investigating Burisma amid an international push to root out corruption in Ukraine.\n\nBut the investigation went dormant under Shokin. In the fall of 2015, Joe Biden joined the chorus of Western officials calling for Shokin\u2019s ouster. The next March, Shokin was fired. A subsequent prosecutor cleared Zlochevsky.\n\nBiden took credit for the firing of Shokin as a foreign policy win during a talk at the Council on Foreign Relations in January 2018, when he boasted about holding up a loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed.\n\nWhat is the relationship between Ukraine and CrowdStrike?\n\nIn 2016, the Democratic National Committee hired CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, to investigate how hackers breached a DNC network and released stolen emails from the committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to WikiLeaks just months before the presidential election.\n\nTrump has since fixated on CrowdStrike, saying that he \u201cheard it\u2019s owned by a very rich Ukrainian.\u201d He has repeatedly voiced his theory that Ukraine \u2014 instead of, or in addition to, Russia \u2014 interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of the Democrats.\n\nIn his call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July, Trump suggested that the company had moved a hacked DNC server to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d Trump said, according to notes describing the call.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s assertions, which have spread widely online.\n\nCrowdStrike, based in California, is not Ukrainian-owned and does not appear to have any Ukrainian connections. There is no evidence to suggest that CrowdStrike conspired to hide a compromised server in Ukraine.", "description": "Accusations that President Donald Trump shaped U.S. policy toward Ukraine for his own political gain exploded into a crisis for the White House in September after a whistleblower complaint.
