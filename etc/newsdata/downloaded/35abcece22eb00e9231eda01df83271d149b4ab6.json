Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s quite hard but maybe it\u2019ll crack my back for me,\u201d wrote Zoe. \u201cAlso the sheets and pillow aren\u2019t clean but thankfully I brought a sleeping bag liner with me (I always travel with it) so will just use that instead.\u201d\n\nThe video of the room quickly went viral, clocking up almost two million views on Twitter.\n\nA number of viewers commented on the small space. \u201cDid you get an owl and an acceptance to Hogwarts as well?\u201d responded one commenter, while another wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s more like a coffin.\u201d\n\nZoe responded: \u201cI find it so funny how so many people are angry on my behalf about the room/cupboard. It\u2019s genuinely fine for me minus the dirty sheets and lack of plug socket (and they could have cleaned it a bit better).\n\n\u201cFinal updates... Had a proper conversation with the host, found out he normally does the cleaning and stuff properly himself, but he was out of town and the guy he\u2019d asked to do it didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe story finished with a happy ending: Zoe met up with an acquaintance from Instagram who said she could sleep on their couch instead.", "description": "An Airbnb room for rent in Brooklyn, New York, has gone viral after one surprised tourist shared a video of the space \u2013 which is effectively a cupboard under the stairs.
