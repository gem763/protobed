AFP/Getty\n\nOn Monday, ahead of his fresh trial, Waterson changed his plea and admitted Alfie\u2019s manslaughter by gross negligence.\n\nBoth Waterson and Hoare had admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice by lying to police.\n\nWaterson, the adopted son of Nigel Waterson, who served as a junior minister in the John Major government, was convicted of intimidating a witness and Hoare of assaulting another witness.\n\nIt is the first time anyone in the UK has died from crush asphyxiation as a result of an electronic car seat, police have said.\n\nScotland Yard\u2019s detective chief inspector Simon Harding branded Waterson \u201carrogant, selfish and deeply unpleasant\u201d and said justice had been served for Alfie.\n\nOn 15 February last year, the defendants had gone shopping for cushions in Sutton, southwest London, accompanied by Alfie, Emilie Williams, 19, Marcus Lamb, 22, and another young child.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

For a three-and-a-half-year-old to be crushed by something so strong and no one helping, it\u2019s a shocking way to die.\n\n\u201cStephen Waterson has come across as a selfish, abhorrent individual who killed a three-and-a-half-year-old child and has never stood up and said what has happened and taken responsibility for the actions he performed on that day.\u201d\n\nThe conviction had finally \u201cgiven Alfie a voice\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cHe was a vulnerable three-and-a-half-year-old who had his life in front of him. He had no one to care for him on that day. Hopefully Alfie\u2019s voice has now spoken to say justice has been served.\u201d\n\nThe court was told social services had been involved with Alfie before his death.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "A man has admitted to crushing a three-year-old boy to death by reversing his car seat as the child sat in the footwell.
