But even as they did so, a Republican senator said that the decision to have Trump National Doral Miami, which is owned by the president's company, host the conference of world leaders shows Trump's \"integrity.\" \"I don't have any concerns about it other than just politically how it appears,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said Friday. \"It may seem careless politically, but on the other hand there's tremendous integrity in his boldness and his transparency,\" Cramer said. Cramer's Republican colleague, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had a completely different view that she expressed in a single word. When asked if it is appropriate to have the G-7 at the Doral, Murkowski said, \"No.\"\n\nOn Friday, a Democratic congressional aide told CNBC that House of Representatives will vote sometime next week on a resolution condemning Trump's decision to select his own property for the summit as inconsistent with the emoluments clause of the Constitution. That clause bars presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments without the consent of Congress. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Thursday revealed that the Doral would be the site of G-7 summit in June. Mulvaney said the resort was clearly the best choice among a dozen or so sites eyed by a team that evaluated the locations. He also said that the Doral would charge the foreign entourages and other guests for goods and services \"at cost,\" which he said would eliminate the chance that the president would reap a profit from the summit. But in a letter Thursday night, three Democratic senators called the Doral pick \"another outrageous example of the President using his office funnel money from American taxpayers and foreign sources into his own pockets.\" The letter, from Gary Peters of Michigan, Oregon's Ron Wyden, and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, noted that Trump has traveled as president more than 20 times to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, \"costing taxpayers millions of dollars with every trip.\" The letter also noted that Vice President Mike Pence stayed at Trump's golf resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, during an official visit last month, and that the U.S. Air Force Inspector General is investigating stays by Air Force personnel at Trump's resort in Scotland. \"President Trump's decision to host the 2020 G-7 Summit at his Miami property appears to have been a foregone conclusion,\" the letter says.", "description": "White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Thursday revealed that the Trump National Doral Miami would be the site of next June's G-7 summit.
