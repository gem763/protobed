Though I suspect it irks many of us, regardless of our philosophical orientation, since it implies that our views aren\u2019t necessarily the result of reason.\n\nAccording to an article in Business Insider, this type of research even shows that differences extend beyond politics.\n\n\u2026what in the brains of conservative and liberal voters actually drive their belief systems? Scientists have been researching the psychological differences between people with different stances, and there are a few key ways that people on opposite ends of the political spectrum see the world. \u2026Liberal and conservative tastes in music and art are different. \u2026liberals enjoyed more cubist and abstract art. \u2026conservative readers tended to say they\u2019d rather visit Times Square than the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u2026conservative voters were found to be more likely to agree with statements like: \u201cI often have tender, concerned feelings for my family members who are less fortunate than me.\u201d But their responses suggested such feelings did not extend to people from other countries. Liberals, on the other hand, were more likely to feel that same level of compassion for people around the world, and even to non-human and imaginary subjects like animals and aliens. \u2026A longitudinal study of more than 16,000 people in the UK found that\u2026 \u201cChildren who showed higher levels of conduct problems \u2014 that is, aggression, fighting, stealing from peers \u2014 were more likely to be economically left-leaning.\u201d\n\nWhat about libertarians?\n\nIn his Bloomberg column, Professor Tyler Cowen reveals that we are the most thoughtful group.\n\nLibertarians measure as being the most analytical political group. That\u2019s according to something called the cognitive reflection test, which is designed to measure whether an individual will override his or her immediate emotional responses and give a question further consideration. So if you aren\u2019t a libertarian, maybe you ought to give that philosophy another look. It\u2019s a relatively exclusive club, replete with people who are politically engaged, able to handle abstract arguments and capable of deeper reflection.\n\nTrump voters and independents, by contrast, are less informed and more impulsive.\n\nWhat else can we learn from this new study of political and analytical tendencies, conducted by Gordon Pennycook and David G. Rand of Yale University? \u2026one group that measured as especially nonanalytical was Democrats who crossed party lines and voted for Donald Trump. There is a stereotype of a less well-educated voter, perhaps both white and male, who reacts negatively and emotionally to Hillary Clinton\u2026 For all the dangers of stereotyping, the study\u2019s data are consistent with that picture. \u2026independents do poorly on the analytic dimension. \u2026that group measures as relatively impulsive and prone to less informed judgments.\n\nAnd here\u2019s some research on \u201cfree-marketeers\u201d from the U.K.-based Times.\n\nClever children will probably grow up to have free-market economic views, according to new academic research. The direct link between intelligence and economic conservatism holds true even if the self-interest that high earners have in a lower-tax, free-market economy is taken into account. The authors of the research, Gary Lewis and Timothy Bates, psychologists at Royal Holloway, University of London and Edinburgh University respectively, state: \u201cIntelligence assessed in childhood [ages 10-11] was predictive of adult [30-33] economic conservatism.\u201d \u2026The authors studied data from the 1970 British Cohort Study and the National Child Development Study of 1958, both of which measured the intelligence of more than 17,000 children before they were distorted by educational differences. The authors also adjusted for sex, parental social class and childhood conduct problems. I like these results, for the obvious reason. But also notice that the authors adjusted the data based on the assumption that a \u201clower-tax, free-market economy\u201d generates greater wealth. Interesting (and accurate) admission. Now let\u2019s consider the statist side of the spectrum.\n\nAccording to some revised research that was reported by the New York Post, our friends on the left have authoritarian tendencies.\n\nA political-science journal that published an oft-cited study claiming conservatives were more likely to show traits associated with \u201cpsychoticism\u201d now says it got it wrong. Very wrong. The American Journal of Political Science published a correction this year saying that the 2012 paper has \u201can error\u201d \u2014 and that liberal political beliefs, not conservative ones, are actually linked to psychoticism. \u2026\u201cThe descriptive analyses report that those higher in Eysenck\u2019s psychoticism are more conservative, but they are actually more liberal; and where the original manuscript reports those higher in neuroticism and social desirability are more liberal, they are, in fact, more conservative.\u201d In the paper, psychoticism is associated with traits such as tough-mindedness, risk-taking, sensation-seeking, impulsivity and authoritarianism.\n\nSince we\u2019re on the topic of authoritarianism, let\u2019s close by looking at some new research, reported by PsyPost, that doesn\u2019t reflect well on the right or left.\n\nNew research provides evidence that left-wing authoritarian attitudes exist in the United States. The preliminary findings, published in the scientific journal Political Psychology, suggest liberals could be just as likely to be authoritarians as conservatives. \u2026Conway and his colleagues developed a measure of left-wing authoritarianism, which was adapted from the right-wing authoritarianism scale developed by psychologist Bob Altemeyer. \u2026The new LWA scale, on the other hand, asks questions such as: \u201cIt\u2019s always better to trust the judgment of the proper authorities in science with respect to issues like global warming and evolution than to listen to the noisy rabble-rousers in our society who are trying to create doubts in people\u2019s minds\u201d and \u201cOur country desperately needs a mighty leader who will do what has to be done to destroy the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us.\u201d \u2026The researchers found that left-wing authoritarianism was associated with liberal views, dogmatism, and prejudice.\n\nIn other words, partisans on both sides are tempted to use the coercive power of government to impose their beliefs.\n\nWhich underscores why government shouldn\u2019t have much power in the first place!\n\nThe good news is that we still have lots of freedom. At least compared to the rest of the world.\n\nThe bad news is that we have less freedom than we used to have.\n\nP.S. You could say we\u2019re becoming less like Liberland and more like Senator Murphy\u2019s dystopia.", "description": "Politically aware people generally understand the policy differences between conservative .09/28/2019 6:19:22AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
