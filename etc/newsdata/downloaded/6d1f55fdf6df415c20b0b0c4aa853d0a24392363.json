Until then, we\u2019re going to stay in the now, focus on what we\u2019re doing right now. Again, as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re just not going to deal with the question until it\u2019s time. \u2026 [Newton] is in his rehab program, doing his program. Our quarterback right now that has been playing for us is Kyle. We\u2019re not going to address it.\u201d\n\nBleacher Report\u2019s Mike Freeman talked with NFL insiders who said it\u2019s not a question of whether Allen, 23, is a better quarterback than Newton but rather whether Allen has a better chance of staying healthy than the 30-year-old Newton, who was shut down because of a shoulder issue last season, had surgery to correct it in the offseason and now has dealt with the foot injury this season.\n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where Freeman gauged the trade market for Newton, finding that as many as 10 teams would be interested, though others are turned off by all the injuries and feel Newton might be on his last legs as a viable NFL starter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of Newton\u2019s $21 million salary cap hit next season, the final year of his contract. Should the Panthers continue to win under Allen, Carolina could keep Newton on the roster for the rest of this season and then cut him, saving a significant chunk against the cap.\n\nSB Nation\u2019s James Dator posits that this shouldn\u2019t even be a controversy, that Newton is far and away the better quarterback when healthy. He points to the success of Swiss-army-knife running back Christian McCaffrey and the Panthers\u2019 defense \u2014 eight interceptions and five fumble recoveries \u2014 as the true reasons behind their 4-0 run, noting also that Allen has fumbled six times in his four starts, losing four of them.\n\nBut there\u2019s that \u201cwhen healthy\u201d stuff again, and Newton has now missed time this season and last season. Whether that\u2019s enough reason for the Panthers to move on from him remains to be seen.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nAD", "description": "Carolina is undefeated with Kyle Allen as its quarterback.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6TdGFD0mVGctUL-kd_aqQkAaT-w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TUBUG6GV3UI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
