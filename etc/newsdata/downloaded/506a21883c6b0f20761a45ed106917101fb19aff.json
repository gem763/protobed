Among all adults, 49 percent say the House should take the more significant step to impeach the president and call for his removal from office. Another 6 percent say they back the start of the inquiry but do not favor removing Trump from office, with the remainder undecided about the president\u2019s ultimate fate. The results among registered voters are almost identical\u2026\n\nMore than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal. Among the critical voting bloc of independents, support for the impeachment inquiry hits 57 percent, with 49 percent saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office\u2026\n\nAsked about the contents of the telephone call, a clear majority of Americans say Trump\u2019s request to investigate Biden and his son was inappropriate (62 percent to 32 percent who felt it was not). Over 8 in 10 Democrats call the request inappropriate, as do 63 percent of independents. Republicans have a different view, with nearly 6 in 10 calling the request for the investigation appropriate and one-third saying it was inappropriate.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Poll-Majority-Of-Americans-Say-They-Endorse-Opening-Of-House-Impeachment-Inquiry-Of-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
