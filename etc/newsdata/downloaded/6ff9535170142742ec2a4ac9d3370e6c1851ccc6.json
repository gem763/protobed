UN Ambassador Feridun Sinirlioglu wrote.\n\nThe Turkish air and ground operation was launched three days after US President Donald Trump opened the way by pulling his country's troops from their positions near the border alongside the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Washington's main ally in the fight against ISIL\n\nTurkey considers the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long armed campaign for autonomy in Turkey and is designated as a \"terrorist\" group by Ankara and many other Western capitals.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the goal of the operation is to create a buffer zone freed of the Kurdish fighters within which some of the 3.6 million refugees currently residing in Turkey can also be resettled.\n\nIn a speech on Thursday, Erdogan dismissed criticism of the operation and threatened to send more than three million Syrian refugees into Europe.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara would take responsibility for suspected ISIL fighters held by SDF.\n\n\"If Daesh (Islamic State) camps or prisons are in the safe zone, we are responsible,\" Cavusoglu told international media, adding that Ankara would ask the home countries of foreign ISIL fighters in its zone to take them back.\n\nIf the foreign countries refuse, as many have, \"it is our responsibility that they [ISIL prisoners] are held accountable and not released,\" he said, adding that Turkey would not be responsible for ISIL prisoners held in other parts of Syria.\n\n'Urgent action'\n\nBoth Turkey and the SDF have reported civilian casualties since the launch of the Turkish operation on Wednesday.\n\nSDF mortar and rocket fire killed at least six civilians in Turkey's southern Mardin and Sanifurla provinces, the provinces' governors' offices said on Thursday.\n\nTurkish operations - including air raids and artillery bombardment - meanwhile left nine civilians in SDF-controlled parts of Syria dead, according to the group.\n\nThe fighting has sent tens of thousands of people scrambling to escape the region and placed many more in danger, the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of civilians in northern Syria are now in harm's way. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must not be a target,\" UNHCR Commissioner Filippo Grandi said.\n\nGrandi's warning was echoed by a coalition of 14 international aid agencies - including medical charity Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) and Oxfam - which said an estimated 450,000 people living within 5km (3 miles) of Syria's border with Turkey were \"at risk\".\n\n\"Urgent action is needed to ensure that the humanitarian situation in north-east Syria does not worsen further, with potentially dire consequences for families and children who find themselves once again caught up in deadly violence,\" the coalition said in a joint statement.\n\nSince erupting in 2011, Syria's war has generated the largest refugee crisis in the world, with about 5.6 million of the country's citizens now spread across the surrounding region, according to UNHCR. More than 6.2 million others are also displaced within Syria's borders.", "description": "European members of UN Security Council register 'deep concern' as US warns Ankara of consequences if it flouts rules.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/567a7d1b84eb451e9563616d7225b4b4_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
