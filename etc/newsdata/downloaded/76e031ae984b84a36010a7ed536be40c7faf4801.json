Henry says slowing growth indicators and the potential for incremental costs from trade negotiations could shake business and consumer confidence. Those effects could carry over into the market, heightening risk. Portfolio risk management isn't a perfect science but there are things investors can do to adjust and adapt when the market begins to shift.\n\nConsider hedged equity.\n\nHedged equity funds are mutual funds that are designed to minimize the effects of volatility on investment returns. Daniel Milan, managing partner of Cornerstone Financial Services in Southfield, Michigan, says these types of funds can help reduce the downside capture for portfolios that include large cap U.S. equity positions. Funds are typically actively managed, with holdings concentrated in stocks that lean toward naturally lower volatility, with a long term goal of achieving capital appreciation through changing stock market cycles, Milan says. JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund (ticker: JHEQX) is a good choice for a hedged equity position, as are funds that include high quality stocks with solid fundamentals and rising dividends. JHEQX currently has a five star rating from Morningstar and is categorized as high return, low risk.\n\nAdjust for timing.\n\nRetirement time lines are another factor to consider in managing portfolio risk. Ken Moraif, senior retirement planner at Retirement Planners of America in Plano, Texas, says the biggest threat isn't missing out on some returns -- it's participating in big losses. The potential for negative impacts is heightened for individuals who are getting into the last five to 10-year ramp-up to retirement. \"Interest rates are probably the biggest threats to investors at this time because they affect almost everything in the economy,\" Moraif says. Dialing back equity exposure to a maximum of 60% is something investors who are retired or close to it should consider if they're concerned about the side effects of rate fluctuations, he says.\n\nDiversify against uncertainty.\n\nTariffs and the possibility of an extended trade war can add to investor worries, as do inflation and movements in the yield curve. The yield curve is a way to gauge how bond investors feel about interest rate risk and it's often used as a recession indicator. There's always the potential for something unexpected that could trigger negative market reactions. Segmenting assets between safety and risk is a good move, says Derek Gregoire, co-founder of SHP Financial in Plymouth, Massachusetts. \"Take advantage of conservative investments like cash, money markets, fixed annuities and bonds,\" he says, since they can offer stability in a portfolio when volatility rises. For instance, investors may choose to divvy up five to 10 years of retirement income in safer vehicles, with the remainder in more aggressive investments. Avoid becoming overweighted and remember that time in the market is more important than timing the market, Gregoire says.\n\nLook at alternatives.\n\nA well-rounded portfolio risk formula may include investments that aren't correlated to Wall Street. Milan says market neutral funds, such as Nuveen Equity Market Neutral Fund (NIMEX), fit the bill, as do private limited partner funds and hedge funds that hold tangible assets such as real estate. Nofee fixed index annuities could be a good substitute for traditional fixed income positions, Milan says, since they offer principal protection. An indexed annuity that's designed to follow a low volatility strategy could be a strong choice if it allows for upside potential, with 100% downside protection. Investors may get more insulation against credit and interest rate risk, which when combined, could challenge the conservative position of traditional fixed income investments.\n\nControl emotional thinking.\n\nProper diversification is important but it's not a true magic bullet for managing risk, says David Bunin, principal advisor at Interlock Financial. A well-diversified portfolio could have lost between 20% to 30% of its market value during the pullback from the last major recession, he says. The better way to handle portfolio risk management is to build it into the portfolio construction process. This means conducting a thorough risk analysis and utilizing core strategies such as dollar cost averaging and owning noncorrelated assets. With dollar cost averaging, the same amount of money is invested on a consistent basis. This type of approach can help remove emotional roadblocks when making decisions during periods of elevated volatility. Avoiding overreactions to stock market headlines and sticking to the plan can make navigating rough spots easier for investors.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Protect your portfolio from volatility.
