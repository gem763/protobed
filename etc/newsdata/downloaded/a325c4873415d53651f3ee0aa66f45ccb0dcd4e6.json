One read: 'Our thoughts are with your family at this tragic time. Such a waste. Time for people to stand up and say no more!'\n\nSpeaking previously about the investigation when the two men were first arrested, Detective Chief Inspector Sam Blackburn said: 'We have been working around the clock to trace those responsible for Tashan's death and this is a positive step in the ongoing investigation.\n\n'I'd like to thank Tashan's family for their patience and strength and once again extend our deepest condolences to them.

He set his standards high, he was hardworking and did everything we asked him to.\n\n'He was a real family-orientated boy and he was a beautiful soul.'\n\nTwo men have since been charged with his murder after a police investigation\n\nLuke Flynn, a colleague and former schoolmate of Mr Daniel, said: 'He will be missed my his friends family and work colleagues.\n\n'He was really involved in his track running. I'm pretty sure he was one of the better runners in the UK. He was always doing it every weekend. He was doing really well in the 100m and 60ms.\n\n'He was a nice guy, quiet, and just got on with his work. It's sickening. It's horrible to hear, he was such a nice guy, he was always up for helping. Everyone was taken aback when they heard.'\n\nA spokesman for Arsenal FC said: 'Everyone at Arsenal Football Club is shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the tragic passing of Arsenal fan Tashan Daniel.\n\n'Our thoughts are with Tashan's family and friends at this sad time.'", "description": "Alex Lanning and Jonathan Camille have been charged after Tashan Daniel was stabbed at Hillingdon Tube Station on September 24.
