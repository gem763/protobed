AMC\n\nLast time fans saw Jesse, he was held hostage by white supremacists who were forcing him to cook in a compound. With help from Walter, Jesse was able to escape and drive off in his black Chevrolet El Camino, which may be the inspiration for the sequel's title.\n\nBased on the movie's synopsis, it'll pick up right after the events of the series finale, with Jesse's whereabouts still unclear.\n\n\"In the wake of his dramatic escape from captivity, Jesse must come to terms with his past in order to forge some kind of future,\" the description reads.\n\nAt least one other character from the original series is confirmed to return\n\nCharles Baker as Skinny Pete in \"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.\" Netflix\n\nCharles Baker will reprise his role as Skinny Pete, one of Jesse's friends.

I have no idea where he is,\" he says in the trailer. \"Don't know where he's headed either. North, south, east, west, Mexico, the moon \u2014 I don't have a clue.

As Walter visits Jesse and offers him an opportunity to be his assistant for $1.5 million, Jesse swiftly turns it down because he's frustrated by how the teacher-turned-drug-dealer has ruined his life.\n\n\"I want nothing to do with you,\" Jesse says. \"Ever since I met you, everything I ever cared about is gone, ruined, turned to s---, dead. Ever since I hooked up with the great Heisenberg. I have never been more alone. I have nothing! No one. Alright? And it's all gone! Get it? No, why would you even care? As long as you get what you want, right?\"\n\nPaul also told NYT that he \"couldn't speak for a good 30, 60 seconds after reading the script for \"El Camino.\"\n\nIt will be available to stream on Netflix on Friday, October 11\n\nAaron Paul and Bryan Cranston on \"Breaking Bad.\" AMC\n\nPeople in need of a refresher on the series can watch all five seasons on Netflix.
