The Bank expects the economy to expand by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year.\n\nWhile this is weaker than the 0.3% growth predicted last month, it means the UK is expected to avoid a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline.\n\nA survey by the Bank showed that consumer spending remained robust, with many families choosing to spend more time in the UK this summer rather than go abroad because of the weaker pound.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption More holidaymakers have chosen to stay in the UK\n\nIt said the increase in \"staycations\" had boosted spending on restaurants and hotel accommodation.\n\nThe Bank also said the government's decision to inject more money into departments in the latest Spending Review would boost UK growth by around 0.4% over the next three years.\n\nWhat about Brexit?\n\nThe MPC said that the ongoing uncertainty over the UK's relationship with the EU risked a further period of \"entrenched uncertainty\".\n\nThey said ongoing uncertainty would lead to weaker growth and less inflationary pressure, reducing the Bank's need to raise interest rates.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting said: \"The longer those uncertainties persisted, particularly in an environment of weaker global growth, the more likely it was that demand growth would remain below potential.\"\n\nHowever, policymakers repeated that more clarity that the economy was heading towards a Brexit deal meant that increases in interest rates would be needed over the next three years.\n\nWhy does the Bank think rates will stay low for longer?\n\nThe Bank of England, like many of us, is on hold, and in a Brexit holding pattern too.\n\nAlthough there is no change in the Bank of England's interest rate decision, marking out the UK from its counterparts in the US and eurozone, there are interesting Brexit developments in September's deliberations of the Monetary Policy Committee.\n\nFor the first time, the Bank has felt the need to signal a direction of travel for interest rates in the now plausible scenario of \"political events\" leading to \"a further period of entrenched uncertainty\" about Brexit.\n\nThe committee concluded that the longer that uncertainty continues, particularly against a background of a weak global economy, the more likely that growth, and also inflation will slow.\n\nThe implication of these minutes being that UK base rates would also remain lower for longer.\n\nIt has until now signalled that rates are likely to rise gradually back from its post-crisis lows only if there was a \"smooth Brexit\", a deal with a transition.\n\nOr else under no-deal, amid exchange rate falls, inflation rises and slower economy, there could be either cuts or rises.\n\nWhat did the MPC say about the global economy?\n\nPolicymakers said the US China trade war had intensified over the summer, which would continue to weigh on overall growth.\n\nManufacturing output continued to be weak, and while policymakers said the direct economic impact of ongoing trade tensions was likely to be \"relatively small\", they said the trade war was \"having a material negative impact on global business investment growth\".\n\nThey did not say how the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil supply would affect inflation except to say that prices had risen sharply following the attacks.", "description": "Policymakers say the UK will avoid recession this year, but Brexit is still weighing on the economy.", "authors": ["Szu Ping Chan", "Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1442A/production/_108868928_cash_pa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
