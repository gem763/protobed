REUTERS/David Becker/File Photo\n\n\u201cBased on the inputs we\u2019re seeing right now and the contracts that will deliver in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see, at this point, more pre-owned aircraft in sales in the fourth quarter,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Jason Aiken told investors on a conference call, with margins on pre-owned aircraft not being as profitable as those for new jets.\n\nIn morning trading, shares of the U.S. aerospace and defense company fell 3.5% to $173.56 after earlier sinking about 4%. Shares had surged 2.5% on Tuesday ahead of the earnings report.\n\nRevenue in the aerospace unit jumped 23% to $2.5 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 29, as new Gulfstream deliveries, a key metric for investors, increased to 38, from 27 a year earlier.\n\nThe company delivered some of its first G600 jets to customers in August.\n\nNet earnings climbed to $913 million, or $3.14 per share, in the quarter, from $851 million, or $2.85 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts estimated earnings per share of $3.06, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nRevenue rose 7.3% to $9.76 billion.\n\nOn Monday, General Dynamic\u2019s Gulfstream division unveiled its widely expected G700 long-range jet, in a challenge to Bombardier Inc\u2019s (BBDb.TO) flagship Global 7500 aircraft.\n\nChief Executive Office Phebe Novakovic told analysts on the conference call on Wednesday that the first flight of the new jet would be in December.\n\nProfit margins at the aerospace unit fell nearly three percentage points to 15.8% from 18.5% in the same quarter last year as the company invested in G600 and G700 jet production.\n\nOperating earnings from the Marine Systems unit, which makes ships and submarines for the U.S. Navy, rose to $209 million, a 24% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago.\n\nCombat systems, which makes tanks, saw its revenue go up 14% from last year to $1.7 billion. In July, the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale to Taiwan of 108 of General Dynamics\u2019 M1A2T Abrams tanks, angering China.\n\nAlso in July, General Dynamics won a $2 billion contract to continue supporting global security, engineering and supply chain missions for the U.S. Department of State.\n\nTotal backlog at the end of third quarter 2019 was $67.4 billion, compared with $67.7 billion at the end of the second quarter.", "description": "Gulfstream jet deliveries helped General Dynamics Corp report a 7.3% rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, but shares fell as much as 4% after company officials said the fourth quarter would see more deliveries of less-profitable refurbished aircraft.", "authors": ["Mike Stone", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444114480&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M11N", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
