As a result, he became the prime suspect in the police investigation into the incident, and matters are set to get much worse for the young man, as he\u2019s charged with attempted murder.\n\nFollowing the events of the riot, the police question David about the attack on Josh in the coming episodes, and \u2014 while doing so \u2014 they show him the video footage from the incident \u2014 the very same video footage which Max stumbled upon during a previous episode, which shows David nearby Josh with scissors \u2014 the very scissors which were ultimately used in the attack.\n\nIn spite of the evidence stacked against him, David professes his innocence \u2014 and it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s worried about how this will all play out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, at the Platt\u2019s household, Shona (Julia Goulding) reveals to Gail (Helen Worth) and Sarah (Tony O\u2019Brien) that the balance of money is due today for the wedding venue which her and David were hoping to claim for their big day, but \u2014 as there\u2019s no guarantee that David will be out of prison in time \u2014 she\u2019s unsure of how to proceed.\n\nMatters go from bad to worse when Shona later receives a text from Imran (Charlie de Melo) \u2014 and he informs her that David has been charged with attempted murder.\n\nLater in the week, Shona, Gail, Sarah, and Nick (Ben Price) all attend David\u2019s hearing in the Magistrate\u2019s Court. David, Abe and Tez all plead not guilty to the attempted murder of Josh, but \u2014 much to the horror of those in attendance, David is refused bail and remanded in custody until the trial.\n\nImran later informs the Platt clan that Josh has regained consciousness \u2014 but what will the rapist have to say?\n\nOne to watch: Thursday 31st October at 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "David's world comes crashing down.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/31_10_coro_david_court_01a-ffe8_1571052266.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
