Photo: Courtesy of the vendors\n\nLast Sunday, I \u2014 along with colleagues from Grub Street and hundreds of others \u2014 spent a rainy morning at the debut location of the city\u2019s newest grocery chain, Wegmans. In the two hours I roamed its aisles, I witnessed the fervor and community among customers and employees that many say is what sets the grocery store apart. I also saw a lot of stuff: most of it either your standard supermarket fare and brands or things made by Wegmans, like its fresh chocolate-chip cookies (which have their own Reddit thread) or bountiful meat-and-cheese plates that made me want to plan a party just so I could have a reason to go back and buy one.\n\nBeing the \u201cupscale\u201d grocer that it is, Wegmans also has a selection of kitchen tools and other nonfood products for the home. Among them are some paper napkins decorated with scenes and patterns made by a company called Caspari. The prints genuinely looked like ones that places like Kaas GlassWorks or John Derian would use to make a fancy decoupage tray. I left with some autumnal napkins sporting an intricately painted turkey surrounded by acorns (my husband and I are hosting Thanksgiving) and, not being familiar with the brand, did some Googling when I got home.\n\nSome may laugh at the thought of \u201cmuseum quality\u201d napkins, but the term isn\u2019t that far-fetched here. Caspari, which has been in the paper-napkin business for some 70 years, produces some napkins in partnership with cultural institutions like Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts and others with heritage luxury-d\u00e9cor brands like Scalamandr\u00e9. While MyDrap napkins are stylish for their minimalism, Caspari\u2019s \u2014 which are not linen but a sturdy \u201ctriple ply\u201d tissue \u2014 are for making a visual statement. Were it not for small, telling details like those little dots paper napkins have around the edges, you could honestly stick one in a frame and pass it off as art (albeit cheap but expensive-looking art). While they may be cheap for art, they\u2019re not the cheapest napkins \u2014 but if you\u2019re hosting a party or holiday meal, one set will go a long way toward completing your table d\u00e9cor. And for the right super-specific person, a pack could even make a nice host or hostess gift. Best of all: You don\u2019t have to go to Wegmans to get them, as many of the brand\u2019s most interesting napkins \u2014 including 12 of my favorites, below \u2014 are sold online.\n\nCaspari Blue-and-White Cocktail Napkins - Pack of 20 These blue-and-white chinoiserie-style napkins look a lot like Blue Willow china.

It\u2019s a collaboration with artist Pamela Gladding, who Caspari says looks to her \u201cgarden as well as the birds, and bees, that visit\u201d for inspiration. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
