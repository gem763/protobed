Washington has blamed Iran, which denies any involvement.\n\n\u201cIf they continue along this path, then they risk the possibility of military action,\u201d Jubeir said of Tehran. \u201cBut nobody wants war. Everybody wants to resolve this peacefully and the end result has to be an end to Iran\u2019s aggressive policies.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia has called the strikes on Abqaiq and Khurais facilities as a test of global will to preserve international order, and will look to form a united front at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week.\n\n\u201cAppeasement with Iran does not work. For example, trying to set up a parallel financial payment system is appeasement. Trying to give them a line of credit is appeasement. It just emboldens them,\u201d said Jubeir.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians have to know that there will be consequences to their actions.\u201d", "description": "If an investigation shows that last week's attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities was launched from Iranian territory, the kingdom would consider it an act of war, but Riyadh is currently seeking a peaceful resolution, a senior Saudi official said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
