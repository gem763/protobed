Despite the fact that there was no ill intent, prosecutors came after Steffon with felony charges, and he eventually pled guilty to reduced charges and received probation and a fine. Two years later, in 2015, then-Governor Chris Christie pardoned the young man, restoring his hope for a career in law enforcement.\n\nJosey-Davis, 24, said he is already back on his quest to become a police officer. \u201cThis is just opening up new doors for me,\u201d said Josey-Davis. \u201cI\u2019d just love the chance to fulfill my dream.\u201d Evan Nappen, Josey-Davis\u2019 attorney, welcomed Christie\u2019s decision, saying his client \u201cmade an honest mistake that he\u2019s explained pretty thoroughly. For him to become a felon and have his life and dreams ruined was just absolutely wrong.\u201d\n\nWith his record expunged, Steffon achieved that dream by becoming a sworn police officer in the state of Maryland in 2018.\n\nWith one goal achieved, Steffon now has another that he\u2019s hoping to accomplish; being hired by his hometown police department.* Given the high scores he received on his civil service exam, Steffon should have been at the top of the hire list for the North Brunswick Police Department, but even after he was pardoned in 2015, the department continued to insist that because of his arrest and guilty plea there in Middlesex County, he wasn\u2019t eligible for employment as a police officer in North Brunswick. Documents reviewed by Bearing Arms reveal the department informed Josey-Davis in 2016 that his name had been \u201cremoved from the North Brunswick Municipal Police Officer open competitive list due to an unsatisfactory background investigation\u201d which revealed that Steffon had been \u201carrested and convicted of unlawful possession of a handgun\u201d, and his name was removed from the list.\n\nGiven the fact that Steffon Josey-Davis\u2019s record had been expunged, you might find it odd that the police department was able to use his conviction and ignore his pardon in order to tell him he wasn\u2019t eligible to be hired. Unfortunately, in New Jersey, even after a pardon and expungement has taken place, an individual can still be removed from an eligible hire list if the government job they\u2019re seeking is in law enforcement, corrections, fire fighting, or the judiciary. The only way to have your name restored is by petitioning the chair of the state\u2019s Civil Service Commission, and that\u2019s exactly what Steffon Josey-Davis is doing now. As he wrote in a letter to the state\u2019s Director of the Attorney General\u2019s Division on Civil Rights,\n\n\u201cFor as long as I can remember, it has been a dream of mine to be a hometown hero, a protector of and a positive role model to the community in which I was cultivated. There appeared no better way to me than to serve that locality as a Law Enforcement Officer. Over the years, this has proven to be quite an evasive feat for all the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nJosey-Davis also explained in that letter why he didn\u2019t appeal the decision by the North Brunswick Police Department back in 2016.\n\nAfter selling all of my most valued possessions and incurring massive amounts of debt to maintain my freedom, coping with the psychological devastation/trauma of possibly having to spend 10 years of my life in prison for a non-violent \u201ccrime\u201d and dealing with the humiliation of being defined as a criminal based solely upon the agents\u2019 acting on behalf of the New Jersey State Government\u2019s lack of knowledge and ignorance of the law, I was elated to finally receive a glimmer of relief and hope from the justice system, regardless of the permanent damage dealt to my reputation, confidence, and finances. The glimmer of hope came in the form of both the Pardon and the Appeal. With this second chance I was motivated more than ever before, and I was able to obtain one of the highest scores for the Civil Service Commission testing for Entry Level Law Enforcement. Despite this, the North Brunswick Police Department denied me for the 4th time on May 2nd, 2016 after being placed back on the list by then Director of the Civil Service Commission Division of Appeals Henry Maurer. They did so in the form of a Notice of Removal Letter, citing an Unsatisfactory Background Check, more specifically citing the Unlawful Possession of a Firearm conviction that had been expunged from my record. The definitive reason as to why I did not file an additional appeal within the 20 day period is because I was exhausted! Mentally, physically and financially. Mentally due to the energy that went into studying to ensure I placed in the highest percentile (I placed 1st) and the trauma endured over the course of the previous year fighting my case. Physically due to the STRESS incurred from that same trauma stemming from the irreparable damage inflicted on my reputation, the debt I had incurred and the worry of not being able to provide for my family in ways I\u2019ve always dreamed of. Financially due to the tens of thousands of dollars I spent fighting the inevitable conviction of a crime which was then found by the highest authority within the state of New Jersey to have not been a crime in the first place and the inability to be able to find a decent paying job! Overcoming all of that only to be failed by the system once more. I was embarrassed and financially and emotionally depleted. While I felt that the handling of this entire process was unethical and unprofessional I had nothing left to give at that point and had run short on options as to how I could earn a living whilst continuing to give this energy. I went out of my way to fight to be back on the list for hire as a police officer. Paying 20 dollars to the State of New Jersey Civil Service Commission to appeal a decision to be placed on the list. Testing and placing 1st on the eligibility list with a score of 98.160, then being denied approx. 9 months later because of an unsatisfactory background check when I was assured by State of New Jersey Authorities that my record had been expunged? This followed by the ire of knowing that I would likely not be able to test again for another three years.. Only prolonging the pursuit of my dreams. I had no other option but to seek employment elsewhere.\n\nSteffon Josey-Davis did find that employment in the state of Maryland. He\u2019s a sworn law enforcement officer now. He\u2019s proud to wear the badge, but that hasn\u2019t killed his dream of returning to the town where he grew up and serving on the force.\n\nI spoke to Steffon on the Friday edition of Bearing Arms\u2018 Cam & Co., where he told me he\u2019s now ready to file a tort claim against the department in an attempt to be placed on the eligible-to-be-hired list. He\u2019s also filed his appeal with the state\u2019s Civil Service Commissioner, and is awaiting the decision. Unfortunately, given the fact that the commissioner is appointed by the governor (in this case, anti-gun governor Phil Murphy), I\u2019m not confident that Steffon will receive a decision in his favor.\n\nI\u2019m rooting for Steffon. I\u2019ve been covering his story since shortly after his arrest, and his perseverance and poise over the years has really impressed me. It would have been very easy to simply give up on his dream, but instead he\u2019s pushed himself time and time again in order to achieve his goals. What a redemption story it would be for the jurisdiction that prosecuted him in 2013 to have him as a police officer, protecting and serving his hometown just a few short years later. Frankly, it be a much better story for North Brunswick Township and Middlesex County than what we have now; a young police officer who is being told that, no matter what he does with his life, it will never be enough to allow him to wear the badge of his hometown police department.\n\nCheck out my entire interview with Steffon Josey-Davis below, and we\u2019ll keep following his story in the weeks to come.\n\n*This story originally stated that North Brunswick Township was where Steffon Josey-Davis was arrested in 2013. The arrest took place in Highland Park, New Jersey, also in Middlesex County.
