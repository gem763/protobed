So, we\u2019re getting an increase in sales, an increase in net profit,\" he said.\n\nBrookes' fateful decision to talk up the next year's result \u2013 rather than stay mum \u2013 came unstuck on March 19, 2015, when his successor, Richard Umbers, revealed the profit would be between $75 million and $80 million.\n\nWhen the bombshell profit downgrade to $77.5 million was finally revealed in September 2015, it triggered a 31 per cent collapse in Myer's share price, from $1.89 to $1.30, and set in train a massive class action, which on Thursday became the first shareholder action to go to judgment.\n\nFederal Court Justice Jonathan Beach found Myer had breached its continuous disclosure obligations and misled shareholders. But he concluded that shareholders had not suffered any financial loss, partly because of the \"hard-edged scepticism\" of analysts.\n\nLandmark decisions\n\nThe decision has hit boards and the investor community in a similar way to past landmark decisions on disclosure, such as the James Hardie, Centro and Fortescue Metals cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Australian Institute of Company Directors warns that boards will inevitably become more cautious in issuing forecasts, which will ultimately hurt investors.\n\nThe threat has alarmed the investor community, which warns that transparency is more critical than ever as companies such as WiseTech and iSignthis are assailed by claims of poor disclosure and inflated valuations, and Crown Resorts is criticised at its AGM for having a culture of secrecy.\n\nAICD chief executive Angus Armour warns that the decision could open the floodgates to class action lawyers because it has confirmed that individuals don't need to show they relied on specific information as long as they can point to market movements.\n\nWhile the litigation funder and class action mastermind Mark Elliott is yet to extract any money from Myer, he is unlikely to be deterred.\n\nThe experienced litigator had already had his first attempt to sue Myer over the breach thrown out of court as an abuse of process in December 2016.\n\nInstead of walking away, Elliott launched a second shareholder class action 20 days later, this time with a new lead plaintiff, new law firm and his company Australian Funding Partners as financial backer.\n\nLitigation funder Mark Elliott spearheaded not one, but two, shareholder class actions against Myer. Paul Jeffers\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 11 day trial in August last year \u2013 and a subsequent hearing in December \u2013 included a revolving door of witnesses, with Brookes grilled twice on the stand.\n\nWhen cross-examined by silk Norman O'Bryan, Brookes continued to defend his position, saying he did not want to disappoint investors.\n\nDeteriorating trading in December 2014 started to ring alarm bells within the company, but Brookes believed it could still reach a $90 million profit through cost-cutting, including a $5 million cut to staff wages.\n\nBrookes told the board they didn't need to update their guidance because internal earnings were still in line with market consensus.\n\nO'Bryan claimed Brookes' motivation for the cost-cutting was to avoid making a profit downgrade.\n\nBrookes denied this. \"It's not being scared of making announcements \u2026 it's making sure we don't disappoint our investors,\" he told the court.\n\nBy March 2015, Brookes' rhetoric could no longer bear scrutiny. He stood down and was replaced by Umbers, a former Australia Post executive, who 17 days later dropped the profit bombshell.\n\nTough disclosure laws\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe landmark case has triggered fresh debate over Australia's disclosure laws and what they mean in practice for directors, executives and investors.\n\nAustralian securities markets adopted tough disclosure laws because some company directors preferred to leave shareholders in the dark rather than release unflattering financial information.\n\nBut the AICD wants to revive a review of continuous disclosure laws proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission in January. The directors' lobby group suggests disclosure laws may need to be relaxed following an explosion in the number of class actions and sky-rocketing directors' and officers' liability insurance.\n\nThe AICD's latest director index sentiment, released on Friday, shows that 70 per cent of directors agree, or strongly agree, that Australian boards are being too risk-averse.\n\n\"The consequence is boards who are already being very cautious and risk-averse ... will want to say even less and be more conservative about forward-looking statements,\" Mr Armour said.\n\n\"Australian directors are more exposed than any other developed economy because they have fewer protections on forward-looking statements.''\n\nAllens partner Jenny Campbell said she had observed a drop in willingness from boards to issue guidance in recent years as shareholder class actions have risen in number.\n\nNeed for vigilance\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think this will go to that trend and certainly makes clear that if you do issue guidance you have to be vigilant in ensuring that guidance remains valid,\u201d she said.\n\nThe AICD recently engaged Herbert Smith Freehills to examine the disclosure regime. The subsequent report concluded that Australian directors were less protected than under similar regimes in the US and Britain.\n\nIan Matheson, CEO of the Australasian Investor Relations Association, said that in practice the Myer decision would put further pressure on a disclosure system already under strain.\n\nJustice Beach's decision confirmed the rule of thumb that companies should update the market when their earnings guidance deviated more than 5 to 10 per cent from market consensus.\n\nBut as the quantity and quality of stock analysis diminishes, the challenge to remain in line can prove tough.\n\nNewcrest was forced to pay a $1.2 million fine to ASIC in 2014 after its investor relations manager tried to get analysts \u2018\u2018in the ballpark\u2019\u2019 and told Credit Suisse and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to \u2018\u2018sharpen their pens\u2019\u2019 because their forecasts were too high.\n\nThe Myer decision makes getting the balance right even tougher.\n\n\"Investors hate surprises,\" Matheson said. \"The more up-to-date information the company can put into the marketplace to fairly value the business is in everyone's best interests.\n\n\"But in economically volatile times, guiding the market too frequently can come back to bite you.\"", "description": "One phone call from the then Myer CEO triggered two shareholder class actions and a landmark court ruling.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.0973%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_293%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/050e8ff2a7e4fe1cb7f30d8978e0a567d8f3344b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
