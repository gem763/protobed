AP\n\nScientists think they finally have an answer to the mysterious acute flaccid myelitis, the polio-like illness that causes paralysis in children, also known as AFM.\n\nA new study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, and published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine, suggests that the devastating disease could be caused by a strain of a respiratory virus called enterovirus.\n\nAFM cases are exceedingly rare; fewer than one in a million children are affected. But for a small number of children, the results are devastating.\n\nIt can paralyze a child's arms and legs. Some need ventilators to breathe. It can also cause muscle weakness, slurred speech and difficulty moving eyes and swallowing.\n\nMany scientists attempted to find the \"missing\" virus in the spinal fluid but failed with traditional testing methods. Experts remained skeptical after the virus couldn\u2019t be found in 98% of AFM patients, later proposing that the disease may have been caused by an autoimmune disorder.\n\nAttention parents: What you should know about the polio-like paralyzing disease the CDC is warning about\n\n\u201cIf we could detect something specific to a virus in the spinal fluid of AFM patients, we would feel more secure claiming that the neurologic symptoms of the disease are virally mediated,\u201d said Michael Wilson, MD, associate professor of neurology at UCSF and senior author of the study.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what the group of researchers set out to do.\n\nWilson\u2019s team, in collaboration with the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health, obtained the spinal fluid from 42 children with AFM.\n\nUsing an enhanced version of the virus-hunting tool called VirScan, they were able to find antibodies against the enterovirus in nearly 70% of the patients.\n\n\u201cThe strength of this study is not just what was found, but also what was not found,\u201d said co-author Joe DeRisi, PhD, professor of biochemistry and biophysics at UCSF. \u201cEnterovirus antibodies were the only ones enriched in AFM patients. No other viral family showed elevated antibody levels.\u201d\n\nQuestions unanswered: Acute flaccid myelitis strikes active 4-year-old. But doctors don't know why he got the polio-like disease.\n\nAlthough this study may have solved the case of the \u201cmissing virus,\u201d the study acknowledges that many questions remain unanswered.\n\nFor example, the strains of enteroviruses that were detected in the spinal fluid \u2013 EV-D68 and EV-A71 \u2013 have never been able to cause paralysis until now. Wilson says that the D68 strain has been linked to the most severe cases of AFM.\n\n\"There's ongoing work to determine if some genetic changes in the virus over the last few years may have made it more prone to causing this polio-like illness,\" he told USA TODAY Tuesday.\n\nWilson also points out that although antibodies for the virus were present, the team was unable to find the actual virus and prove that it's the causing agent to AFM.\n\nPriya Duggal, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says another question that needs answering is why only a subset of children are developing AFM even though the enterovirus can be detected in thousands of kids.\n\n\"This is about what causes AFM,\" Duggal told USA TODAY. \"Even if we find the causative pathogen, something else is happening that we don\u2019t understand.\"\n\nAlthough more research is needed, both Wilson and Duggal say that a logical next step should include research into antiviral drugs \u2014 and possibly even developing a vaccine.\n\nNearly 600 cases in 48 states and D.C. have been confirmed in the U.S. since 2014, with 20 cases confirmed in 2019, according to the CDC.\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY.
