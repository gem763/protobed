In six months they could have lost millions of credit card numbers.\"\n\nInstead, Menlo's technology takes a different approach to battling phishing and ransomware threats, by allowing corporate customers to disconnect from the internet completely.\n\nThe technology disconnects and isolates company networks from the public web, while providing cloud-based access to all the information on the internet. Menlo claims its solution is \"100 per cent effective\".\n\n\"The best way not to be attacked is to disconnect,\" Mr Ben-Efraim said. \"The problem is that the internet has become a critical part of modern society. So you need a method to still realise the benefits of the internet without being connected to it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Australia is not immune'\n\nMenlo's entry into the Australian market comes as watchdogs including the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority have chastised banks and financial services companies for not taking cyber risks seriously enough.\n\nIn its corporate plan released in August, APRA said boards and company directors specifically need to take responsibility for the burgeoning online threat.\n\n\"Cyber attacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and impact globally. Australia is not immune to this,\" the corporate plan stated.\n\n\"Capabilities across APRA\u2019s regulated institutions, and their key service providers, are variable with a range of cyber exposures and preparedness observed.\n\nThe Australian Cyber Security Centre, a federal government agency, recommends that organisations adopt the \"highly effective\" strategies of network segmentation and segregation.\n\nMr Ben-Efraim claims Menlo's technology complies with this Australian government edict, and said banks around the world are being pressured by regulators and consumers to take this approach.\n\n\"Large banks literally have billions to lose, and they know that cybercriminals are working tirelessly to attack them,\" he said.\n\n\"Strong and effective cybersecurity is becoming synonymous with stability in our financial services industries.\"\n\nIn addition to Ms Boo, Menlo hired Keith Symons, a former Oracle business development manager, in May. Mr Symons will lead the Australia and New Zealand sales team from Melbourne, with a focus on clients in banking and the defence and intelligence industry.", "description": "Silicon Valley-based Menlo Security is bringing its \"disconnect and isolate\" approach to keeping high-risk industries secure to the Australian market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.673%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1137%2C$y_375/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e05cacbce0437c8e66319d7c898f0843bab72892", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
