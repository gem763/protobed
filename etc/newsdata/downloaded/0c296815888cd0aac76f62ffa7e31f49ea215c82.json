With the exception of Rudy Giuliani and George W. Bush around September 11, it is the norm for politicians to get booed at ballgames, and the Nationals fan base from the D.C. area \u2014 including lots of journalists and other insiders \u2014 doesn\u2019t overlap much with Trump\u2019s natural base of support. Yet the Left is lovingly sharing clips of the booing and analyzing them like the Zapruder tape to prove \u2014 I\u2019m not sure what.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, some others are saying that it was inappropriate for Trump to get booed, and especially to get the \u201clock him up\u201d chant thrown back at him. I\u2019ve never been enamored of the \u201clock her up\u201d chant, but have never taken it particularly seriously, either. You have to make an allowance for boisterousness at political rallies, and ballgames.\n\nBut the whole \u201cbaby shark\u201d thing? For that, there\u2019s no excuse.", "description": "It is the norm for politicians to get booed at ballgames.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
