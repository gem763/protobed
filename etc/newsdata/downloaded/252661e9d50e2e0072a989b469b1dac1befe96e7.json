At one point he tweeted that the Times should shut its doors\u2014an astonishing statement except in the wake of his sustained crusade against the paper.\n\nHOW I REALIZED THE NY TIMES KAVANAUGH STORY WAS A TRAIN WRECK\n\nTrump later modified this, saying at his New Mexico rally that he has \u201ccalled for the resignation of everybody at the New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh smear story. And while you are at it, the Russian witch hunt hoax, which is just as phony a story.\u201d\n\nCalling Kavanaugh \u201ca great, brilliant man,\u201d Trump went on: \u201cThey've taken the Old Gray Lady -- you know, the New York Times, for years, the Old Gray Lady, so prestigious. They have taken the Old Gray Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue, and ruined her reputation. She can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management. The Times is dead. Long live the New York Times.\u201d\n\nOf course, Trump is happy to quote his hometown paper when it runs something favorable. But the Times provided the ammunition with a piece that left out crucial information from their reporters\u2019 book. The story indirectly cited a lawyer as saying he saw Kavanaugh expose himself at another drunken Yale party, yet left out the alleged victim having told friends she doesn\u2019t remember any such incident.\n\nMeanwhile, Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, author of \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\u201d took to the airwaves to defend themselves and promote their book.\n\n\u201cThere was zero attempt to mislead anybody,\u201d Kelly told MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell.\n\nTo his credit, O\u2019Donnell asked the authors about the critical omission from their newspaper piece. They say their draft included that language.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\n\u201cSo somewhere in the editing process, those words were dropped?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIt was in editing \u2014 done in haste in the editing process as you know for closing the section,\u201d Pogrebin said.\n\nNow that made me feel some sympathy for them, though I fail to understand how an editor could leave in an explosive charge of indecent exposure against a Supreme Court justice but delete the part about the alleged victim not remembering it. And I have to say, as a longtime newspaper reporter, I never let any story be published without looking at the edited version, and sometimes pushed back against mistakes that were inserted or crucial details removed.\n\nSome Democrats are still using the controversial piece to call for impeachment. On Rachel Maddow\u2019s show, Kamala Harris demanded an impeachment probe, saying the confirmation hearings had been a \u201csham process.\u201d Maddow did not bring up the criticism of the Times story or the correction.\n\nStill, Democratic leaders have made clear that the impeachment idea is going nowhere. Jerry Nadler said he\u2019s too busy trying to impeach Trump.\n\nSome Democrats are complaining that the FBI last year took no action when Sen. Chris Coons wrote a letter about Stier\u2019s account, four days before the confirmation vote. But the bureau, which conducted a limited probe, didn\u2019t have much to go on, and some committee Democrats knew of the allegation and said nothing publicly.\n\nOne mystery was resolved yesterday when the authors went on \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nThe Times, in promoting the Kavanaugh story, posted a tweet that it later deleted as \u201cclearly offensive.\u201d It said:\n\n\"Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn't belong at Yale in the first place.\"\n\nRobin Pogrebin admitted on the ABC show that she wrote the tweet. Her explanation?\n\n\u201cI drafted this with this in mind to have actually the opposite effect, which is to anticipate those who would say, \u2018A guy pulling down his pants at a party when they\u2019re drunk is on the spectrum of sexual misconduct. It\u2019s not sexual assault. It\u2019s not rape. What\u2019s the big deal?'\u201d", "description": "With President Trump calling for mass resignations at the New York Times and the authors of the Brett Kavanaugh story blaming editors for a glaring omission, the uproar over journalism, the high court and sexual assault shows no signs of fading.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/17/694940094001_6087178098001_6087175678001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
