Buratti said the demonstrators were also planning a march elsewhere on the Lido later in the day.\n\nThe protesters, who belong to Italian and foreign groups, were taking part in a five-day Venice Climate Camp event.\n\n\"The climate crisis has no borders, why should we stop at some border and just care about some local problems that we have back home,\" said demonstrator Sina Reisch from the German group Ende Gelande. \"We must see that the struggles are connected.\"\n\nThe demonstrators got the support of rocker Mick Jagger and veteran actor Donald Sutherland, who will walk that red carpet later to present their thriller \"The Burnt Orange Heresy\".\n\n\"I am glad they're doing that because they\u2019re the ones that are going to inherit the planet,\" Jagger said at a news conference to promote the movie.\n\n\"We\u2019re in a very difficult situation at the moment, especially in the U.S. where all the environmental controls that were put in place, that perhaps were just about adequate say for the last 10 years, are being rolled back by the current administration, so much that they will be wiped out.\"\n\n\"I am glad people feel so strongly about it they want to protest anywhere whether it's the red carpet or another place.\"\n\nSutherland said environmental protesters had \"to fight harder\" and \"get as much support as they can\", adding those calling for the plight of migrants also needed backing.\n\n\"When you're my age ... 85 years old and you have children and grandchildren, you will leave them nothing if we do not vote those people out of office in Brazil, in London and in Washington. They are ruining the world,\" he said. \"We have contributed to the ruination of it but they are ensuring it.\"", "description": "Climate change activists storm red carpet at Venice Film Festival", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF860GR_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
