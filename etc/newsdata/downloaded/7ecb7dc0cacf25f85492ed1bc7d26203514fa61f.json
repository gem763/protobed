I feel like a lot of people think I\u2019m not going to play more games [ever again]. But I feel good. I feel like . . . \u201d\n\nMax Scherzer, sitting on the postgame interview podium, cut Zim off, snapping sarcastically, \u201cI really don\u2019t think these are his last games. Only you think these are his last games.\u201d\n\nTalk about a contract push!\n\nLet the record show that, after a fist pump at first base, Zimmerman ran the bases with hard determination still locked on his face \u2014 perhaps showing how desperately he felt the need to deliver after striking out in his first two at-bats. The hang time for his 414-foot blast was a preposterous 6.1 seconds, long enough for Trea Turner to round the bases twice. Okay, long enough for a fast man to get from home to second base, or Atlanta\u2019s Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. to get out of the batter\u2019s box.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs if to underline the D.C. mythology of Zimmerman\u2019s blow, Dodgers power hitter Max Muncy crushed what looked like a long home run to center in the eighth inning, a shot that sent Michael A. Taylor to the wall, looking up, before he had to dash in a few feet to make the catch.\n\n\u201cI was just hoping it didn\u2019t hit that wall of wind,\u201d GM Mike Rizzo said. \u201cBut when Zim hits \u2019em, they stay hit.\u201d\n\nManager Dave Martinez started laughing and imitated his own \u201cblowing\u201d with his mouth in the dugout, trying to help the ball.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a beast,\u201d fellow Nats first baseman Matt Adams explained.\n\nAs usual, Zimmerman tried to be modest \u2014 always the same approach, don\u2019t try to do too much: \u201cGot on top of a high fastball \u2014 finally.\u201d But then he said, \u201cThis is what we live for. . . . No, I can\u2019t explain how those moments feel. You can\u2019t replicate it anywhere else. But afterwards, you take some time to cherish it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOthers will, too.\n\nThis game, setting up a do-or-die meeting with the possibility of the wild-card winners beating the 106-win, back-to-back pennant-winning Dodgers, had other hair-raising moments. In the seventh inning, an exhausted Scherzer faced left-handed slugger Joc Pederson as Martinez stayed nailed to the top dugout step, even though the Nats\u2019 lone lefty, Sean Doolittle, was warm.\n\nSvrluga: Scherzer is Scherzer again, and the Nationals\u2019 season lives because of it\n\nPederson lashed a bases-clearing, three-run double down the right field line \u2014 at least that\u2019s what they may tell you in L.A. Right field umpire Ted Barrett called it foul. Replay showed that it was foul by perhaps a half an inch. If Barrett had pointed \u201cfair,\u201d would there have been enough evidence to reverse the call? We\u2019ll never know.\n\nAD\n\nWe do know that Scherzer\u2019s next pitch, his 109th, produced a groundout, ending the ace\u2019s night at seven innings of three-hit, one-run, seven-strikeout ball. And with that hairbreadth escape, the last big Dodgers push died.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou never know what might\u2019ve happened,\u201d said Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, \u201cbut, shoot, Max threw the heck out of the ball.\u201d\n\nScherzer reduced that split-second and fraction of an inch to the fact that he caught \u201ca break with Pederson.\u201d\n\nThe implications of this Stay in the Fight victory, which had most of the crowd of 36,847 standing for much more than an hour, from the moment Zimmerman\u2019s homer landed, could have lasting ramifications. Why? Because the Dodgers, the class of the National League, to the despair of their fan base are suddenly in deep Dodger Blue doo-doo. The pressure meter in Chavez Ravine has jumped higher than the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\nAD\n\nThe Dodgers have a \u00ad6-foot-5, 235-pound problem, one with a 0.64 career ERA in the postseason. The new Hollywood horror flick \u2014 \u201cNightmare on Vin Scully Avenue\u201d \u2014 is scheduled to open Wednesday, and the lead will be played by Stephen Strasburg, once described by teammate Jayson Werth as \u201cjust a big, hairy, scary furry animal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Dodgers, for all their money, all their tradition and, at times, all their haughty vanity, have found more ways than their oldest fan has fingers and toes to avoid winning a World Series since 1988.\n\nNow, from the 101 to the Slauson Cutoff, from the hours-long traffic jams on Interstate 5 to the smoggy vastness of the city\u2019s banal suburban sprawl, one name will be on every baseball tongue: Strasburg, who fanned 10 Dodgers in six innings of Game 2 on just two days\u2019 rest after winning the wild-card game with three innings of relief.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s Mr. Hairy Scary going to do on full rest?\n\nOvechkin throwing the first pitch before Game 4 deepens the Caps-Nats connection\n\n\u201cWe got another game to play,\u201d said Strasburg, almost smiling, and adding that after his relief stint six days ago, he\u2019s finally back on his regular routine and feels \u201creal good\u201d for a start on full rest.\n\nAsked why he has done so well in the playoffs, Strasburg said, \u201cYou train for this, dream of this, from the time you\u2019re a kid. You want the chance to see how your stuff stacks up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Dodgers counter with their own large and menacing right-hander, Walker Buehler, one of the few pitchers with stuff roughly comparable to Strasburg\u2019s. He held the Nats to one hit in six scoreless innings in a Game 1 victory.\n\nAD\n\nThis matchup is the right meeting to decide which team advances to the NL Championship Series. The Dodgers were utterly dominant all season, but the Nats were almost as imposing over their final 112 games, when they went 74-38 and outscored their foes by a staggering 184 runs, just a few less than the Dodgers\u2019 margin in the same span.\n\nIf this series now has an extra twist, it\u2019s that the Nats may have two relievers, Doolittle and Daniel Hudson, who are not overmatched by the Dodgers\u2019 lineup. With an off-day Tuesday, both should be primed for Game 5.\n\nFor 137 days, the Nationals have shared huge grins and secret handshakes, group hugs and shimmy shakes, victories and glee. What once looked like a lost season \u2014 and maybe even a losing year by a team without a compass \u2014 suddenly turned into a month-after-month dugout dance party.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter 93 regular season wins, a wild-card game comeback victory and now a pair of comebacks to even this NLDS, the music still hasn\u2019t stopped for these Nats. The fight they\u2019ve stayed in for so long will now go the distance with the Dodgers. The Nats have been in this Game 5 spot three previous times in the past seven seasons \u2014 but never as the underdog, using every trick of pitching staff management to neutralize the Dodgers\u2019 obvious advantages.\n\nAs the Nats took the field for the ninth, the stadium PA system blasted the Beastie Boys: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to fight / For your right / To party!\u201d\n\nThe fight goes on for a few more days. The party could follow.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nInside the Nationals\u2019 gutsy Game 2 pitching plan that evened the NLDS against Dodgers\n\nJuan Soto is a very quick learner.
