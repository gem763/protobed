Other video showed supporters chanting \"FIFA, Thank You\".\n\n\"We have an incredible feeling as the first Iranian women entering the stadium,\" said one fan, interviewed by local television.\n\nAnother video interview, distributed on social media, showed a woman fan inside the stadium, on the brink of tears with an Iranian flag over her shoulders and painted on her face.\n\n\"It was really a very big wish. Really, thank you for letting us come. I'm shaking. Thank you,\" she said.\n\nIranian women arrive at Azadi stadium to attend Iran's FIFA World Cup Asian qualifier match [Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANA via Reuters]\n\nSparsely attended\n\nAl Jazeera's Zein Basravi reporting from the stadium in Tehran said that there are around 3,500-4,000 women who have been admitted inside, but it is a small number considering the stadium has a capacity of 80,000.\n\nHe added that a crowd of women had gathered outside of the stadium still trying to enter.\n\n\"We spoke to one woman who said that she's going to try to get in even if she has to stay there until the end of the day,\" Basravi said.\n\n191009090321072\n\n\"Another woman we spoke to said that she doesn't even like football, but getting into the same games as the men are allowed to attend is an equal rights issue, it's a women's rights issue.\"\n\nThe game was sparsely attended but an extra area, next to the designated women's section, was opened for what appeared to be women who did not have tickets for the arranged area.\n\nGovernment spokesman Ali Rabiei said he viewed the presence of women at the stadium as a positive step, according to the official IRNA news agency.\n\n\"The government has said to us that as far as they're concerned, this is the forward trend,\" Basravi said.\n\n\"The number of women attending stadium games will only go up but there is a proviso - they will only do so in so far as authorities are able to maintain Islamic values, maintain public order laws that are in line with Islamic codes of conduct.\"\n\nWhile campaigners have welcomed the access granted for Thursday's game, it is unclear if such scenes will become the norm in Iran.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has urged Iranian authorities to open up stadiums to women for all games, not just World Cup qualifiers.\n\nThe sport's global governing body sent officials to Tehran to monitor access for women at the match and said it will continue to press for their inclusion.\n\n\"FIFA's stance on the access of women to the stadiums in Iran has been firm and clear: women have to be allowed into football stadiums in Iran. For all football matches,\" FIFA had said in a statement.", "description": "More than 3,000 women attend FIFA World Cup qualifying match in Tehran to watch Iran beat Cambodia 14-0.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/100fc54f9efb4a458a39475f1a3490e7_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
