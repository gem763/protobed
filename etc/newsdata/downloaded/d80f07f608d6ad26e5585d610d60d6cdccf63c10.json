Falls were larger on bonds with other issuers. Italy outperforms, with the 10-year BTP yield down about 19 basis points at a new low of 0.791%,\n\nThe new QE program is expected to \u201crun for as long as necessary,\u201d the ECB said.\n\nThe bank also promised not to raise interest rates \u201cuntil it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge\u201d with its target of just below 2%. Thursday\u2019s cut was the ECB\u2019s first since March 2016.\n\nWith interest rates falling further below zero, the ECB also moved Thursday to provide relief for the region\u2019s embattled banks, whose profits have been hurt by negative interest rates. The ECB will create a mechanism to shield banks from the full force of negative rates, and sweeten the terms of a fresh batch of long-term loans.\n\nMr. Draghi will discuss the details of the ECB\u2019s decision at a news conference starting at 08:30 ET, where he will also unveil a new set of economic forecasts for eurozone growth and inflation. Investors will parse his words for clues as to the ECB\u2019s next steps. It is Mr. Draghi\u2019s penultimate press conference before his eight-year term ends on Oct. 31.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How do you think the ECB rate cut would affect the U.S.?
