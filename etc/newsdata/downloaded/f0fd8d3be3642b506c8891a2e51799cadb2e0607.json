The penalty shoot-out victory against Colombia was viewed through those lessons and much credit was given to the FA\u2019s head of people and team development from Yorkshire, who had spent most of her professional life in Australia.\n\nThe Daily Mail called her \u2013 on its front page \u2013 \u201cThe woman who won that penalty shoot-out for England\u201d. Yet when her departure was announced by the FA, there were no tributes from key figures. There was a statement from Grange, who said that \u201cculture coaching is now firmly embedded in the England experience\u201d and reassuring all concerned that she had established a strong team in the notably brief 18 months she spent at the FA.\n\nHer departure date was unspecified, although it is understood that she is not with the senior team in their current camp at St George\u2019s Park and, last week, there was another announcement. Grange\u2019s first book Fear Less: how to win at life, without losing yourself will be out in May next year, just in time for Euro 2020, and it would be fair to say that Ebury, the publisher, is not underplaying her connection with the England team.\n\n\u201cThe psychologist who helped transform the England team,\u201d is the big sell on the press release. A self-help book, one assumes, to find your inner Jordan Pickford.\n\nThose quoted by the publisher in praise of the author include the Duke of Cambridge \u2013 \u201cEngland were a better team with her on board\u201d \u2013 and Dele Alli who, along with Ashley Young, was fulsome in his praise of Grange before the semi-final against Croatia. There is even a line from The Daily Telegraph, although lamentably misquoted from the original article.", "description": "The departure of Dr Pippa Grange from the Football Association in July certainly attracted much less attention than that lavished on the organisation\u2019s most celebrated sports psychologist in the white heat of the 2018 World Cup finals, when a nation was spellbound by the side\u2019s transformation.", "authors": ["Sam Wallace", "Chief Football Writer", "Luke Edwards"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212518120-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdyzzeLTVDDdM_6qhSz43_EYMapKPjdhyLnv9ax6_too.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
