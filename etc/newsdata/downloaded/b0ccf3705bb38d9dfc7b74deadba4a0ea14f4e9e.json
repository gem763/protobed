In 2017, CEO Brian Cornell announced that the chain would be injecting investments into things like small-format locations in urban areas, store remodeling projects, team members, and owned brands.\n\nSkeptical of the company's decision to pour cash into brick-and-mortar rather than clear-cut e-commerce, Wall Street sent shares spiraling down in the wake of the announcement.\n\nBut, according to the two Target executives who spoke at the second annual Groceryshop conference in Las Vegas on Sunday, the massive spending campaign has paid off in a major way.\n\n\"We're really excited, looking at the results that we just posted,\" Target's vice president of real estate Laurie Mahowald said. \"And 2018 has been the best year we've had in over a decade.\"\n\nIn her keynote speech later in the day, Target's executive vice president of food and beverage Stephanie Lundquist described the chain's strategy as a decision \"to strengthen some of the things our guests say they love about Target, like our owned brands, our stores, and our team.\"\n\nMahowald spoke on a panel with Rachel Elias Wein, founder of real estate strategy firm WeinPlus, and Kroger corporate real estate VP Nick Hodge. The Target executive said that the chain will have undergone 1,000 store remodels by the end of 2020.\n\nRead more: A Target exec who posed as a researcher to interview unsuspecting shoppers describes how their brutally honest feedback allowed the company to improve its grocery game\n\nWhile investors initially feared that doubling down on physical locations was a losing bet, Mahowald said that the investments have helped transform stores into \"mini distribution centers\" capable of fulfilling digital orders.\n\n\"The store is the center of our strategy,\" she said, when it comes to in-store and digital shopping experiences alike.\n\nMahowald also addressed the portion of the $7 billion investment that went toward boosting product offerings in different categories.\n\n\"We want to improve the in-store experience for our guests through better assortment, revamping the food and beverage area, home, apparel, fixtures, and lighting,\" she said.\n\nLundquist echoed Mahowald's remarks, specifically mentioning Target's new owned brand in the food category, Good and Gather, as well as its policy of demanding \"rigorous testing\" when it comes to its food products.\n\n\"From a Target perspective, we're doing amazing things in beverage, remodels, small formats, and new fulfillment options ... building a team, and rebuilding our processes, and launching Good and Gather,\" Lundquist said. \"All of those things are helping an iconic brand truly break new ground in such an important part of our business, and the American retail landscape as a whole.\"", "description": "Target EVP of food and beverage Stephanie Lundquist and VP of real estate Laurie Mahowald echo the chain's confidence in its store investments.", "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d822a4d2e22af6bd674ad92-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
