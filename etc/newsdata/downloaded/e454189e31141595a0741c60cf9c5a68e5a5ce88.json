Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d In Hong Kong, two million of the city\u2019s seven million residents are protesting against communist China\u2019s attempt to annihilate their freedom. To show their fealty with the United States, thousands of demonstrators bravely wave American flags as they are shot, gassed, and roughed up by communist thugs from mainland China.\n\nThis situation has become a hot topic around the world. And it has placed a giant spotlight on the National Basketball Association (NBA), which is very cozy with communist China. The NBA\u2019s response has been pathetic. No doubt, the organization\u2019s weak reaction can be somewhat attributed to the fact that the NBA\u2019s current and future business model is so reliant on the 1.4 billion Chinese consumers who seem to love American basketball.\n\nAs the NBA continues to protect its business interests, the league\u2019s biggest star, Lebron James, is on a crusade of his own. No, Lebron is not criticizing the reprehensible actions of China\u2019s communist leaders. Lebron, the social justice warrior, believes Morey (and the rest of the world) misunderstands the situation in Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to the astute political scientist Lebron James, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a \u2026 feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.\u201d James went on to state, \u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. Just be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. Yes, we have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negatives that come with that as well. \u2026 Sometimes social media is not always the proper way to go about things as well.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Lebron James is telling the world to look away and remain silent as the Chinese government commits atrocious crimes against millions of people. China is a police state with a vast concentration camp network for anyone who opposes communist party doctrine.\n\nThis seems strange because Lebron James, more than anyone, should be well aware that freedom, in all its glory, has made his life infinitely better.\n\nIn 1984, Lebron James was born in Akron, Ohio. James, who was raised solely by his mother, grew-up in abject poverty. Based on these circumstances, one could likely assume that Lebron\u2019s life would be full of trials and tribulations. However, Lebron James is arguably the best-known and wealthiest athlete in the entire world.\n\nLebron James is paid hundreds of millions of dollars because he can throw a ball through a hoop better than the average person. In the years since his NBA debut in 2003, James has won multiple MVP awards and a few NBA titles, while also becoming quite the political pundit.\n\nIn 2016, James proclaimed, \u201cI support Hillary because she will build on the legacy of my good friend, President Barack Obama. \u2026 Only one person running truly understands the struggles of an Akron child born into poverty.\u201d\n\nReally, Lebron? Hillary Clinton could not be more out of touch with the struggles of an Akron child (or any child in any city). This obvious truth did not, however, deter Lebron from going all-in on his support for Clinton during the 2016 election.\n\nDespite his favored candidate failing to secure victory in the 2016 presidential election, Lebron has maintained his side gig as a political pundit by unabashedly bashing President Donald Trump. According to James, Trump is a \u201cracist, hatemongering, bum\u201d who has no place in the Oval Office.\n\nLebron\u2019s dalliance into the world of political commentary has come to a crescendo. His insistence that we not judge the record of the Chinese government is simply because he wants to increase his bank account. James is a total hypocrite. While he tweets away about how terrible America is and how much he hates President Trump, he actually has the audacity to lecture the world on China\u2019s human rights abuses.\n\nEither Lebron James has no clue about the reality of China\u2019s human rights abuses, or he is more concerned with protecting his millions of dollars in endorsement deals with companies such as Nike, which are basically beholden to the Chinese market. Oh, and it just so happens that Lebron is also a budding movie star. He is currently behind the mega-movie Space Jam 2, which is expected to be a worldwide box office blockbuster, especially in China.\n\nSimply put, Lebron James, like so many out-of-touch elites, has adopted the \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d motto. For James, placating to Chinese communists is all in a day\u2019s work.\n\nMaybe Lebron should heed his own advice and get off Twitter to enlighten himself about the dire situation in Hong Kong, instead of spouting nonsense and desecrating the very country (and political system) that helped him to become one of the wealthiest and well-recognized people in the world. If James grew up in China, I doubt he would be living the same life or espouse the same pro-China, anti-America rhetoric.\n\nChris Talgo (ctalgo@heartland.org) is an editor at The Heartland Institute.", "description": "Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey recently tweeted, \u201cFight for .10/18/2019 0:50:33AM EST.", "authors": ["Chris Talgo", "Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/288/2f98efeb-fa4e-4e41-baa8-260aa73bfcc9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
