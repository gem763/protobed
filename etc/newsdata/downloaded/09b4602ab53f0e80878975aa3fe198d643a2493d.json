Publicis was at its lowest level since July 2012.\n\nInvestment banks Macquarie and Societe Generale both cut their recommendations on Publicis, with SocGen cutting Publicis to \"hold\" from \"buy\".\n\nLate on Thursday, Publicis, which competes against bigger rivals WPP and Omnicom, said it now expected sales to fall by about 2.5% on an underlying basis, compared to a previous outlook of \"broadly stable net revenue\".\n\nPublicis Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun, who succeeded company veteran and current chairman Maurice Levy in 2017, has promised to offset the decline in ad spending by steering the business closer to consultancy groups.\n\nHe is also aiming to offer clients technological tools on top of traditional creative marketing campaigns, but the strategy is taking more time than expected to bear fruit.\n\n\"There is significant long-term value in Publicis in our view, since we remain confident in the agency model and adaptability, but the company-specific string of revenues misses implies a longer normalisation phase than we had expected,\" SocGen analysts wrote in a note.
