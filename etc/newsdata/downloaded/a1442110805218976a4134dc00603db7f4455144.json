As well, two of the wounded are in critical condition, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said at 6 p.m. local time.\n\nVideo of the apparent shooting spread quickly on social media. The footage appears to show an officer opening fire as a protester comes at him with a baton, striking the officer's shooting arm.\n\nTaken by the City University Student Union, the video shows a dozen black-clad protesters hurling objects at a group of riot police and closing in on the lone officer, who is seen pointing his revolver and opening fire at the protester. The protester then collapses onto the street, bleeding from below his left shoulder.\n\nAnother demonstrator rushes in to try to drag away the injured protester, and is tackled by an officer as gasoline bomb lands in the middle of the group of officers in an explosion of flames.\n\nWatch: Hong Kong police fire tear gas at National Day protesters\n\nPolice in Hong Kong fired multiple rounds of tear gas to disperse pro-democracy protesters as Communist China marked its 70th anniversary. 0:43\n\nThe shooting marked a dramatic escalation in a city already on edge as violence has spread to multiple areas.\n\nThe smell of stinging tear gas and smoke from street fires started by hundreds of protesters engulfed the Wan Chai, Wong Tai Sin, Sha Tin, Tuen Mun, Tsuen Wan and Tsim Sha Tsui areas.

An annual fireworks display had been called off two weeks ago.\n\nPolice lined up to separate the demonstrators and counter-protesters, but minor scuffles ensued. Two pro-Beijing protesters were arrested.\n\nA security clampdown in the city to thwart the unrest that would embarrass Chinese President Xi Jinping failed to deter the protests, including a massive march in the city centre.\n\nOrganizers said at least 100,000 people marched along a broad city thoroughfare in defiance of a police ban, chanting anti-China slogans, with some carrying Chinese flags defaced with a black cross. Police didn't provide an estimate of the turnout.\n\n\"Today we are out to tell the Communist Party that Hong Kong people have nothing to celebrate,\" said activist Lee Cheuk-yan. \"We are mourning that in 70 years of Communist Party rule, the democratic rights of people in Hong Kong and China are being denied. We will continue to fight.\"\n\nProtesters used umbrellas as shields and threw tear gas canisters back at police. Police said protesters used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun, injuring officers and some reporters.\n\nIn Wong Tai Sin, a gasoline bomb that protesters hurled at police exploded near motorcycles parked along a pavement, creating a large blaze that was put out by firefighters. Some protesters placed an emergency water hose down a subway station to try to flood it.\n\nA water cannon truck sprayed blue water, used to identify protesters, to disperse crowds from advancing to government offices in the city.\n\nAnti-government protesters march in Wan Chai district.

The system was implemented when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The protests began in early June over a now-shelved extradition bill that activists say was an example of how those promises have been eroding.", "description": "Fierce clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police broke out in multiple parts of Hong Kong on Tuesday, with at least one person shot and 31\u00a0wounded, in the most widespread violence challenging Chinese rule as the Communist Party celebrated its 70th year in power.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303894.1569929548!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1178302985.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
