We will do something about this.\n\n\"I am a big believer in day-night Tests. Kohli is agreeable to it. I see a lot of reports in newspapers that he is not, but that is not true.\n\n\"The game needs to go forward and that is the way forward.\n\n\"People should finish work and come to watch champions play.
