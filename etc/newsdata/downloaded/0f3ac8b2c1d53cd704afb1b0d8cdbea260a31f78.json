After saying he would have mandatory buybacks of all AR-15s, O'Rourke doubled down, saying he know people would follow the new law, should it become a reality.\n\n\"My confidence is in the people of this country. Go into a gun show in Conway, Arkansas and listening to the owners of AR-15s and the vendors of AR-15s, many of whom, you can imagine, didn't agree with my proposal, but each of whom was willing to at least have the conversation, some of whom said, 'Look, you know what? I have an AR-15. Don't need it. Would gladly sell it back or destroy it,'\" O'Rourke told MSNBC's Joy Reid. \"All of them seem like they'd follow the law. We are a nation of laws. It's part of what defines us and distinguishes us from the rest of the world.\"\n\n\"I believe that America will comply with the law and I believe that there will be a due process in devising the law in the first place, where we listen to stakeholders, all concerned and affected,\" he explained. \"But do not allow the delays that we've seen that have lasted decades to stop us from finally acting on this.\"\n\n\"I don't want to give into the hype or some of the scare tactics out that have been employed to stop us from even considering this in the first place, much like we don't go door-to-door to enforce any law in the United States. In fact, I don't think we do that for any law in the United States,\" O'Rourke said with a smirk. \"This would not be something that we'd do and I only raise that, Joy, because others have said, you know, this is something we would fear if there were mandatory buybacks program. No, we expect people to follow the law. And that's certainly what I believe will happen.\"\n\nSo, let's get this straight.\n\nMass shooters break the law by shooting people so what does Beto want to do? He wants to punish law-abiding gun owners... by making them hand over their AR-15s. Or, as you like to call it, by \"buying them back\" (even though they were never purchased from the government to begin with).\n\nBeto is under the impression that people are just going to show up to the police station, hold out their firearm and say, \"Here you go! Please destroy on my behalf!\" As if. Never. Going. To. Happen.\n\nThe people he's wanting to punish are not the people carrying out these heinous crimes. Those who commit these murders are already breaking the law. Hello! Murder is illegal. You can't make it even more illegal. And taking away guns from innocent people doesn't suddenly address the issues we've seen with shooters. Not to mention, adding another law to the books doesn't make a criminal decide to suddenly follow the laws. They don't wake up one morning and say, \"Gee. There's now one more gun control law on the book. I better change my ways.\"\n\nThat's not just stupid. That's delusional.\n\nGet a grip, Beto. You're so hell bent on firearm confiscation that you can't even see how stupid your argument is. If people are obtaining their guns on the black market or through straw purchases, what does having law-abiding people hand over their guns do? Ab-so-lute-ly nothing. All it does is turn them into sitting ducks.\n\nAnd you say law enforcement won't come knocking on doors to confiscate firearms? As if gun owners are that stupid. We've said for years that Democrats and anti-gunners want complete firearm confiscation. You confirmed our suspicions and what we knew to be true. This is just the stepping stone.\n\nYou can say \"hell yes!\" to a mandatory buyback but the rest of us are saying \"MOLON LABE!\" And in case you don't know what that means... come and pry it from our cold. dead. hands.", "description": "Geez..09/14/2019 19:57:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/44/77c5f8f1-e992-40fd-894a-968f8ea4efac.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
