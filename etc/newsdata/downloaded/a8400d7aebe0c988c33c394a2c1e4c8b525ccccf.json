He re-emerged with a harrowing story.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "Josh Morgerman recorded the storm\u2019s menacing progress by the minute.\n\nAt 8:17 on Sunday morning, he said the gusts of wind were getting scary at the schoolhouse in Marsh Harbour on the Bahamas\u2019 Great Abaco, where he was hunkered down, waiting for one of the most destructive hurricanes in island history to make landfall.\n\n\u201cI feel like a rocket is about to take off,\u201d he wrote to his 80,000 Twitter followers, amassed during his long career as a tempest chaser known for capturing harrowing eyewitness video. \u201cThis is gonna get ugly.\u201d\n\nAs the cyclone known as Dorian closed in, he prepared to be cut off from the Internet, from the rest of the world: \u201cthis is possibly the last you\u2019ll hear from me for a long while,\u201d he warned.\n\n4 am chase update. pic.twitter.com/kSHHu9E7w1 \u2014 Josh Morgerman (@iCyclone) September 1, 2019\n\nAt 11:15, Morgerman reported that his building was near the hurricane\u2019s eyewall, its most destructive area where winds blow fastest. He said he and six others had barricaded themselves in a concrete room, pushing chairs against the door to keep it closed.\n\nTwenty-five minutes later, he sent what would be his final tweet from the middle of the storm.\n\n\u201cPounding. CRASHING. Boards prying off windows,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re moving children to a safe space, wrapping them in blankets.\u201d\n\nThen, nothing.\n\nMorgerman\u2019s account was dark for the next 54 hours.\n\nOnline, people wished him luck and implored him to stay safe.\n\nOn the ground, Abaco was at the time one of the most unlucky, unsafe places in the hemisphere.\n\nFor nearly two days \u2014 from a few hours after Morgerman\u2019s final tweet until Tuesday afternoon \u2014 Dorian ceaselessly slammed the Bahamas with a catastrophic combination: winds that whipped at 185 mph, but a storm that crept along, maximizing its devastation.\n\nAnd the school where Morgerman took refuge was in one of the country\u2019s hardest-hit regions. For a short while this week, no one had heard from him, even as his friends and fellow pursuers posted updates of their own. The storm passed, but rumors swirled. He was feared dead.\n\nThen, at 5:52 Tuesday evening, the Weather Channel\u2019s Twitter account published a photo of Morgerman, brows raised and eyes sunken. \u201cWe are in contact with Hurricane Chaser Josh Morgerman,\u201d the post read. \u201cHe is safe.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post could not reach Morgerman that night.\n\nBut some 15 minutes later, he began tweeting again. He had made it out of the storm and into Nassau, the capital city. But he brought with him a terrifying story.\n\n\u201cYep, I\u2019m alive,\u201d he began in a series of posts. \u201cBy far the most intense cyclone I\u2019ve witnessed in 28 years of chasing. Thought I was playing it safe by riding it out in a solid-concrete school on a hill in Marsh Harbour. Thought wrong.\u201d\n\nWinds pounded the building with the force of a thousand sledgehammers. Crept out during eye to find school mostly destroyed, cars in parking lot thrown around & mutilated. Barometer said 913.4 mb. \u2014 Josh Morgerman (@iCyclone) September 3, 2019\n\n\u201cWinds pounded the building with the force of a thousand sledgehammers,\u201d he added.\n\nThe school was mostly destroyed, and there was more storm to come. Without shelter, Dorian could be deadly. But Morgerman and others inside the building had caught one break: They were, at that moment, in the eye of the hurricane \u2014 a tranquil, but fleeting respite from a ferocious vortex.\n\nThey took their chance to flee, driving to a government building that was filled with new refugees.\n\n\u201cThe calm eye saved lives \u2014 gave victims chance to relocate,\u201d Morgerman wrote.\n\nHis story, along with others that began to emerge from the island nation as the storm moved north, serve as the first accounts of a historic event. Dorian has flattened buildings, perhaps leveling entire towns. It has claimed seven lives, but government officials expect the toll to rise much higher. It could define the Bahamas for decades.\n\n\u201cWhole neighborhoods were swept by mighty surge higher than anything in memory,\u201d Morgerman wrote in a final plea on Tuesday. \u201cAreas above water had catastrophic wind damage. Many deaths reported from drowning, flying debris, & collapsing houses. Medical clinic overwhelmed. An absolute catastrophe. SEND HELP TO ABACO ISLANDS.\u201d\n\nIn aerial footage taken after the storm passed, the cameramen narrate the island\u2019s desolation, pointing out landmarks no longer visible beneath torrents of floodwater.\n\n\u201cGone, Jesus \u2026 gone, underwater \u2026 the fire station, gone \u2026 Jesus.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHurricane Dorian has smashed all sorts of intensity records in the Atlantic Ocean\n\nDorian\u2019s horrific eyewall slammed Grand Bahama Island for 40 hours straight\n\nHere\u2019s what it looked like inside the eye of Hurricane Dorian", "description": "\u201cWinds pounded the building with the force of a thousand sledgehammers.\u201d", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "September At Pm", "Reis Thebault Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News.
