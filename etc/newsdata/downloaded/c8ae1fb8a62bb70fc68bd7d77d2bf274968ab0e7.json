The three rap stars were talking to promote their new Netflix reality competition series Rhythm + Flow.\n\n\u201cYou all can quote me on this a couple of years down the line,\u201d Chance the Rapper said. \u201cI think Trump is going to win again at the next election because he\u2019s got the biggest base.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does. I believe it,\u201d said Cardi B, citing the passion levels of Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cI really hate to say it, but sometimes I do believe that Trump will be winning,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because due to the fact that every single time I don\u2019t see nobody saying they love a Democratic candidate. There\u2019s no candidate that people are saying like we love, we want them to win.\u201d\n\nCardi B said Trump supporters are motivated by racism against Mexicans.\n\n\u201cEvery single time he always talk about how he want to take away Medicare and shit like that. A poor white man that\u2019s getting Medicare is not even caring that he\u2019s saying that, he just cares that he hates Mexicans and he want to get rid of them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people vote with feelings in America and a lot of their feelings is racism and religion.\u201d\n\nCardi B is a vocal supporter of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and has appeared with the candidate at public events.\n\nChance the Rapper said the two-party system is responsible for President Trump\u2019s ruse to power.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two parties that pick who they want to run for office, and then there\u2019s a bunch of lobbying and money that gets thrown around, and eventually they come out and say, \u2018This is who our leader is,'\u201d he said.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
