The idea that his 1972 track \u2018Rock and Roll II\u2019 could have been been included for a pivotal scene (in which Joaquin Phoenix descends an outdoor staircase as he completes his transformation into Batman\u2019s iconic foe) has shocked U.K. audiences.\n\nWith Joker grossing an estimated $93.5 million in ticket sales from 4,374 screens in North America this weekend, breaking the record for an October opening, Glitter\u2019s royalty payment could leave him nicely set up for his release, which could come as soon as 2021 under British law.\n\n\u201cArtists are usually paid a one-off \u2018synchronisation fee\u2019 when their songs are used on movie soundtracks,\u201d Ray Bush, managing director of The Music Royalty Co., told Yahoo!, \u201cIt can range from \u00a3500 for smaller acts, up to \u00a3250,000-\u00a3500,000, depending on the artist and the importance to the narrative of the film.\u201d\n\nSome allegations against Glitter came to light 40 years after they occurred.", "description": "\u2018Joker\u2019 has been beset by controversies, but the fact that it uses music by a child sex offender Gary Glitter seems an extraordinarily insensitive oversight.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_17/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570443979/GettyImages-462785426_wedibl", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
