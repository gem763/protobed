Giles wants to improve England\u2019s succession planning and ensure there is an English coach with enough experience to take the top job in the future after appointments of an Australian in Bayliss and South African Kirsten.", "description": "Gary Kirsten is in line to be appointed England head coach this week in a major coup for Ashley Giles.", "authors": ["Nick Hoult", "Cricket News Correspondent", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/01/TELEMMGLPICT000210755559-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
