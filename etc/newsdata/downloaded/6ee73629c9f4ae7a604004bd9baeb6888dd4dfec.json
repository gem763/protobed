That is one reason that the free expression of religion is under such intense pressure in the West.\n\nBut it seems to me that we aren\u2019t really becoming less religious. Rather, many are merely changing that in which they put their faith. For some, it is the neo-earth religion of radical environmentalism that personalizes nature and advocates \u201cnature rights\u201d for \u201cPachamama,\u201d (the Incan earth goddess), or sees the earth as akin to a sentient organism, as in Gaia theory.\n\nTranshumanism comes even closer to that mark. The movement began advocating the right to engage in radical body alterations, such as brain implants to increase intelligence or genetic engineering to grant one the powers of a comic book super hero. Lately, it has evolved (if you will) to promise that we never have to die if we only harness the wonders of technology. There is even a prophetic point in time, known as the \u201cSingularity\u201d \u2014 akin to the fundamentalist concept of Rapture \u2014 when the cascade of AI and other tech advances will birth a corporeal New Jerusalem.\n\nHere\u2019s a description of this idea just published in The Guardian:\n\nImagine that a person\u2019s brain could be scanned in great detail and recreated in a computer simulation. The person\u2019s mind and memories, emotions and personality would be duplicated. In effect, a new and equally valid version of that person would now exist, in a potentially immortal, digital form.\n\nWhat good is that, you ask?\n\nAt the simplest level, mind uploading would preserve people in an indefinite afterlife. Families could have Christmas dinner with sim Grandma joining in on video conference, the tablet screen propped up at the end of the table \u2013 presuming she has time for her bio family any more, given the rich possibilities in the simulated playground. It\u2019s this kind of idealised afterlife that people have in mind, when they think about the benefits of mind uploading. It\u2019s a human-made heaven.\n\nI hate to disappoint the transhumanists, but their minds and personalities uploaded into a computer would be no more \u201cthem\u201d than the animatronic Abraham Lincoln at Disney World is the real Honest Abe. It would be a mimic computer program. Wherever \u201cyou\u201d were, it wouldn\u2019t be in cyberspace.\n\nThe neo-religions we see emerging in the contemporary era tend to be anti-human. Radical environmentalism perceives us as the cancer afflicting Gaia. Transhumanism posits that we are are so inadequate that we have to be remade in our own image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut both \u2014 and others \u2014 offer their believers meaning, which is no small thing. Transhumanism also provides its mostly atheistic or agnostic adherents hope that is destroyed by naked materialism \u2014 and with the additional \u201cbenefit\u201d of never having to atone for sin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the West becomes less theistically religious generally and increasingly anti-Christian specifically, expect new forms of faith to continue emerging. A society crafted along the lines of John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d is unattainable. The need to believe is hard-wired in our beings.
