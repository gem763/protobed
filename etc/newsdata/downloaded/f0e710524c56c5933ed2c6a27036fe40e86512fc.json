Reg replied straight away \u2013 but Frank never got his letter.\n\nIt was returned, unopened, with the word \u201ckilled\u201d pencilled on the envelope.\n\nAnd for more than a century Frank lay lost in the cold earth of a foreign field, in an unmarked grave with two others.\n\nBut, remarkably, thanks to a team of War Detectives using painstaking research and forensic tests, his remains were identified last year.\n\nAnd Frank was finally laid to rest with full military honours at a British war cemetery in France in front of his emotional descendants.\n\n\u201cI hope my grandfather, Reg, and his parents had been informed of Frank\u2019s death before this letter arrived,\u201d says his great-nephew Paul Mead, 54, holding the achingly poignant envelope.\n\n\u201cBut it must have been a terrible shock anyway. How can one word \u2013 killed \u2013 sum up the essence of a man who had fought for three years on the Western Front and given his life for his country?\n\n\u201cDiscovering Frank\u2019s heroism and character a century after his death has been an extraordinary privilege.\u201d\n\nThe remarkable work of the Ministry of Defence\u2019s War Detectives is revealed in a special edition of ITV series Long Last Family on Monday.\n\nPresenters Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell followed the all-female squad as they battled to solve Case 370 \u2013 three bodies discovered by a man digging a ditch in his back garden in Anneux, France.\n\nA shoulder badge suggested they were members of the 23rd Battalion of the London Regiment who fought there in October and November.\n\nAnd the names of 13 men from that regiment with no known grave recorded on a nearby memorial was a starting point for investigators Tracy Bowers, Nicola Nash and Louise Dorr.\n\nForensic examiners put age and height estimates to the remains and the team compared those to the service records of the lost 13.\n\nThat narrowed down the list to three possible soldiers: Privates Frank Mead, John Steele and Henry Wallington.\n\nLiving relatives for each of the men were then traced and DNA kits sent to each family. It all came as a huge shock to lawyer Paul Mead and his sister Julia who emigrated to America as teenagers. Their father, Reg Mead\u2019s son, had died when they were small so they knew nothing about the great-uncle.\n\nPaul said: \u201cWhen the MoD first called asking me to do the test I thought it was a scam. I had often wondered why I\u2019d been given the middle name Frank but didn\u2019t know his story.\n\n\u201cSo I contacted a cousin in England and he sent me a treasure trove of letters Frank had written to Reg as well as some of his sketches and some pictures of him in uniform. His letters to Reg had a real brotherly intimacy,\u201d Paul said.\n\n\u201cHe was talking about the horrors of war, like gas attacks, but making light of it all. In one letter he said \u2018Old Fritz uses a new type of gas which he sends over in a shell. It makes you sneeze.\u2019\n\n\u201cReading Frank\u2019s words and seeing his photo I felt an instant connection with him. So, when the tests came back confirming the remains belonged to Frank I was overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nThe team identified another of the soldiers as Private Henry Wallington, 19. They traced his half-niece, Margot Bains who also never knew he existed. For, it emerged, Henry\u2019s married father had an affair with Margot\u2019s grandmother Violet and had a second secret family. Margot was shocked but proud of Henry, who enlisted in 1916.\n\nThe detectives also traced Sandra White from Croydon, the great-niece of their third potential match, Private John Steele, a biscuit-factory worker who joined up when he was only 17.\n\nSandra\u2019s nan \u2013 John\u2019s sister \u2013 had spent years wanting to know what happened to her brother, who was 19 when he died. She says: \u201cDid he get shot and was he in pain? There\u2019s a gap missing from the family.\u201d\n\nBut Sandra was devastated when Davina broke the news that the tests revealed it was not John\u2019s body and the remains could not be identified But she took comfort in knowing that the men died close together and he was with his friends to the very end.\n\nAfter 100 years laying in unmarked graves, Frank, Henry and Soldier X were finally laid to rest in a deeply moving ceremony at the Hermies Hill British Cemetery close to where they fell.\n\nThey were given full military honours by members of the Princess of Wales Regiment \u2013 the modern descendants of the 23rd London.\n\nFrank travelled to France with his three children and sister Julia and met Henry Wallington\u2019s family.\n\nThey were joined by dignitaries, French residents, Davina and Nicky and the War Detectives.\n\nSandra White was not able to bury her lost great-uncle John \u2013 but she still went along to pay her respects.\n\n\u201cI wanted to come for the boy who\u2019s not been named,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so sad that someone\u2019s gone through that and died and there\u2019s nobody there for him.\n\n\u201cSo I came to say goodbye to him.\u201d", "description": "ITV's Long Lost Family reveals how War Detectives painstakingly traced the histories of the 'unknown soldiers' whose bodies were found in a French garden", "authors": ["Rachael Bletchly"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20643467.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196064258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
