On Thursday, he presented a National Hurricane Center map that was obviously doctored by Sharpie to journalists in the Oval Office.\n\nYet NOAA has now sided with the president. \u201cFrom Wednesday, August 28, through Monday, September 2, the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama,\u201d its statement said. \u201cThe Birmingham National Weather Service\u2019s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nThis statement is extremely closely written. And NOAA leadership did find a single forecast tool that indicated a small part of southeastern Alabama faced a 5 to 10 percent chance of experiencing 40 mile per hour winds.\n\nYet this is beside the point, because Alabama never actually experienced those winds. In the course of this week, winds in Alaga, Alabama\u2014a town in the state\u2019s southeastern-most corner\u2014never exceeded 9 miles per hour, according to the weather-almanac database Dark Sky.\n\nPhotos: The wreckage left by Hurricane Dorian\n\nAnd if NOAA is in a mood to nitpick: President Trump\u2019s statements disagreed far more with \u201cprobabilities from the best forecast products available\u201d than the Birmingham office\u2019s did. At no point was Alabama \u201cmost likely [to] be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d And this is not even the most egregious example. \u201cThey actually gave that a 95 percent chance probability. It turned out that that was not what happened,\u201d Trump said on Thursday. The National Weather Service never forecast that Dorian had a 95 percent chance of hitting Alabama.\n\nI have ignored this story for the last few days, figuring that the president\u2019s bizarre behavior should not distract from the U.S. government\u2019s overall skilled preparation and handling of a historically dangerous hurricane. But this statement has turned what has become a routine type of political story (the President has said something misleading!) into one that\u2019s slightly more Soviet\u2014and much more worrying. Americans have gotten used to living in a country where partisanship is unavoidable. But living in a country where weather report is sometimes partisan and untrustworthy\u2014that\u2019s something new.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
