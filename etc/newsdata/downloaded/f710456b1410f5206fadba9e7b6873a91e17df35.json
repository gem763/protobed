Trade associations representing them spent an additional 128 million in that period.\n\nIn April the watchdog Global Witness calculated that oil and gas majors were planning to spend US$5 trillion on new exploration by 2030, a figure it said was \"poles apart\" from the Paris goals.\n\nA spokeswomen from Total told AFP that the figures contained in Thursday's report \"in no way reflect\" what the group spends on lobbying.\n\nPublic records show Total spent between 1,750,000-1,999,999 euros on EU lobbying last year, an amount the spokeswoman said had stayed \"stable for many years\".\n\n\"Total is convinced that a collective approach is necessary to respond to the magnitude of the climate issue,\" she said.\n\nAn ExxonMobil spokesman said the giant \"complies fully with the requirements of the EU Transparency Register.\"\n\n\"ExxonMobil believes that climate change risks warrant action and it's going to take all of us - business, governments and consumers - to make meaningful progress,\" he told AFP.\n\nA spokeswoman for Shell said it \"firmly rejected\" the report's premise.\n\n\"We are crystal clear about our support for the Paris agreement... everything we do is to advocate for good policy outcomes to that end.\"\n\nBP and Chevron did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n'FIREWALL'\n\nThe green groups called for a \"firewall\" to protect EU officials from fossil fuel representatives to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\n\"Tackling the climate emergency means leaving the vast majority of known fossil fuel reserves under ground and that is incompatible with the future projections of these firms who are going to massively increase their production over the next 10-20 years,\" Mr Sabido said.\n\nMyriam Douo, from Friends of the Earth Europe, said citizens could no long afford the \"delay tactics\" of fossil fuel producers.\n\n\"We must listen to the millions of young climate protesters on our streets and cut fossil fuels out of our politics now.\"\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [PARIS] The five biggest publicly listed oil and gas companies and trade groups representing them spent more than 250 million euros (S$380 million) lobbying the European Union to influence climate action since 2010, environmental groups said Thursday. .
