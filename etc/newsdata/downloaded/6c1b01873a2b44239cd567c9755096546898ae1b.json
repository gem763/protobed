It would normally be a good strategy to bank money now for this heavy push that\u2019s coming ahead. To be drawing down now is not a great sign,\u201d said Michael Malbin, a political scientist at the University of Albany who heads the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute.\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders received about 60 percent of their money from the smallest donors. Buttigieg got a little less than half his money from small donors.\n\n\u201cAs they are entering into the crucial phase, those three candidates have donors to whom they can return. To the extent that you\u2019ve depended on donors who have maxed out, they\u2019re done,\u201d Malbin said. \u201cThat is a problem that Biden will have to address.\u201d\n\nMany of the candidates in the field are using their millions to build field armies to march across Iowa and New Hampshire in search of votes.\n\nWarren, whose campaign is ubiquitous across the early states, had a staff of 503 in the last pay period before the quarter ended. Those staffers are spread among 47 offices throughout Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, as well as the campaign\u2019s headquarters in Boston.\n\nSanders paid 476 staffers in the last pay period, while Buttigieg had 397 aides on payroll. Biden has staffed up quickly, too, with 367 operatives working for his campaign. Harris, who is rededicating her campaign to Iowa, is paying 253 people.\n\nCollectively, the Democrats running for president employed nearly 3,000 people by the end of September.\n\nBy contrast, Trump\u2019s campaign reported paying just 70 staffers at the end of September \u2014 though hundreds more work for the Republican National Committee, which operates hand in glove with the campaign.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign paid its pollster, John Anzalone, $122,000 for field research, the FEC reports showed. Harris shelled out $120,000 to David Binder, another longtime Democratic pollster.\n\nNeither Sanders nor Warren reported spending any money on polls. Trump\u2019s campaign paid two pollsters \u2014 Tony Fabrizio and McLaughlin Associates \u2014 a combined $239,000 to test the electorate last quarter.\n\nCandidates and their campaigns spend much of their money on air travel, zipping between early states and fundraisers in the country\u2019s largest cities. But some candidates \u2014 particularly Biden \u2014 have developed a pricey habit of flying on private jets. Biden\u2019s campaign reported spending $923,000 on chartered jets, twice as much as the next-highest spender, Buttigieg.\n\nBiden's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSanders\u2019s campaign spent $360,000 on private flights in the third quarter. Harris spent $253,000 on those flights, and Warren\u2019s campaign spent $132,000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThough the Democratic candidates spend their days bashing the influence of technology and social media giants like Facebook, Twitter and Google, those companies are among the biggest recipients of campaign spending. The FEC reports showed Biden, Buttigieg, Castro, Sanders, Steyer and Warren all spent seven figures on digital advertising buys \u2014 and those figures are likely much higher if the campaigns paid consulting firms to make buys on their behalf.\n\nSteyer spent almost a third of his money, $14.8 million, on digital advertising buys. Buttigieg spent nearly $8 million online, including on some alternative platforms like Hulu, Roku and Pandora. And Sanders, who supports breaking up Facebook, spent $3.8 million on digital platforms.\n\nThe huge fundraising numbers show excitement among donors \u2014 both to the Democrats, who raised so much collectively, and to Trump, who maintains $83 million in his campaign account. Trump raised more money in the last quarter than any previous presidential candidate.\n\nMalbin said many Democratic donors would come back to invest more, even if their chosen candidate does not win the primary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet that every one of those donors, or a very high percentage of those donors who gave to any one of those candidates will continue to give to whoever\u2019s the presumptive nominee,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no lack of money on either side.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates raised a combined $186 million during the third quarter, setting a breakneck pace even as President Trump stockpiles a massive campaign account.\u00a0Three of the candidates who hope to fa", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sandersbernie_warrenelizabeth_buttigiegpete_101619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
