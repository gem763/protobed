After signing a contract extension Thursday that keeps him with the Washington Wizards until at least 2022, he said he thinks he can take the Wizards down the same path.\n\n\u201cI view it as a challenge. I view it as something that I feel like a lot of D.C. sports have been a part of, rebuilding something and building them into championship-caliber teams,\u201d Beal said. \u201cSo why not me? Why kind of sell myself short of a great opportunity that I have in my hands right now?\u201d\n\nThe All-Star guard said that those other teams\u2019 successes were not a big factor in his decision to stay in Washington, but he \u201ccan\u2019t neglect\u201d that they represent what he wants to accomplish.\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019ve all built powerhouses,\u201d Beal said. \u201cThey\u2019re having success and continuous success over the last couple years. I can\u2019t ignore it. It\u2019s kind of cliche, people may think, but hard work does pay off. When you have good camaraderie and a good group of people who come together on and off the court, it\u2019s displayed onto the play on the field or on the court. I\u2019m definitely thinking about the other teams in D.C.\u201d\n\nBeal has struck up a friendship with Capitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov and sometimes attends their games. He and John Wall both had a big presence at Mystics games this season, especially in the playoffs as the team captured its first WNBA title.\n\nAs for baseball, the Nationals certainly count in the same category, having won their first-ever pennant and reached the World Series. But to get there, Washington beat the St. Louis Cardinals \u2014 Beal\u2019s hometown team.\n\nNevertheless, the recent renaissance of the District as a sports town had an effect on Beal, who had been courted by other teams as a potential trade target before Thursday.\n\n\u201cJust seeing the atmosphere, seeing how D.C. is,\u201d he said. \u201cD.C. loves sports, period. Whether it\u2019s baseball, basketball, football, hockey, soccer, everything. Even the soccer team\u2019s in the playoffs. So we\u2019ve got everything here. This is a good city, it\u2019s a great city, it\u2019s a super city. It\u2019s a beautiful market.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
