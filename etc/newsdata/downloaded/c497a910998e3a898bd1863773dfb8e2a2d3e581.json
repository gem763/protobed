Jean was in his living room eating a bowl of vanilla ice cream on Sept. 6, 2018, when Guyger entered the apartment, which was one floor directly above her apartment, Hermus said.\n\nFox 4 reported that Guyger allegedly was distracted by texting Martin Rivera, her police partner.\n\nProsecutors questioned Rivera extensively about a 16-minute phone conversation he had with Guyger as she headed to her apartment that night in September 2018. Asked what it was about, he said he believes it was mostly about police work but his memory of the call was hazy. Again, however, he denied that it involved plans to see Guyger later that evening.\n\nIn his opening statement, defense attorney Robert Rogers dismissed the prosecution arguments.\n\nGAMER SENTENCED TO PRISON IN DEADLY 'SWATTING' CASE\n\nGuyger \u201cwas on autopilot,\u201d he said of her entrance to Jean\u2019s apartment. \u201cShe had tunnel vision.\u201d\n\nRogers also dismissed as \u201cpreposterous\u201d the relevance of Guyger\u2019s sexual relationship with her partner.\n\nGuyger was off duty but still in uniform when she shot Jean. She told investigators that after a 15-hour shift she parked on the fourth floor of the complex\u2019s garage \u2013 rather than the third floor, where she lived \u2013 and found the apartment\u2019s door ajar.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThree days after the shooting, Guyger was arrested for manslaughter. She was subsequently fired from the Dallas Police Department and charged by a grand jury.\n\nThe jury will have to decide whether Guyger committed murder, a lesser offense such as manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, or no crime at all.\n\nClick for more from Fox 4.", "description": "Prosecutors, on the first day of the trial, contend a former Dallas police officer accused of murdering a man who she wrongly believed was in her own apartment was distracted by sending sexually explicit text messages to her police force partner.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
