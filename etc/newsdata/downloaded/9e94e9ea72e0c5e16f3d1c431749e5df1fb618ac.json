A writer\u2019s hard work. A complex story a la Gone Girl doesn\u2019t just pop out of a writer\u2019s brain fully-formed on a random Tuesday. Giving a reader what they crave is about structure and pacing and, ultimately, originality. In 2019, it\u2019s also about writing characters with more depth than your archetypal male dick motivated by some dead girl who maybe, if she\u2019s lucky, gets to have a name.\n\nTo learn more about the elements of great mystery architecture, Vulture asked eight masters of the form to anatomize their thinking, from the most conceptual level down to the technical details. None of their tips or habits are compulsory, and some even contradict each other, but together they represent craft perfected to the level of art. (Spoiler: literal crafts are sometimes involved.)\n\nBe Your Own Audience\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote my first novel, I was just writing it for me,\u201d says Alex Michaelides, whose debut, the Silent Patient came out last February. \u201cNow, for my second novel, I have an agent and a really good editor. I\u2019d be lying if I said they weren\u2019t in my head. I think a lot about, would they like this, what would they think about this?, but it\u2019s not helpful to focus on that stuff. You have to try and forget about it and just focus on the story.\u201d\n\nDead Men Should Actually Tell Tales. Dead Women, Too.\n\n\u201cThe stories we write should give the victims in the work real standing,\u201d says Laura Lippman, the bestselling author whose latest was The Lady in the Lake. \u201cThe biggest trap for a crime novelist to fall into is that the murders themselves are the MacGuffin, that the people who die and the circumstances in which they die aren\u2019t that important, that you\u2019re writing a story where the only thing that matters is what happens to the investigator. I don\u2019t want to write crime novels in which a bunch of people die, but since my main character becomes a better person, it\u2019s all good. I want to write a story in which people die, and their deaths matter because they were living, breathing human beings, and they\u2019re not there anymore.\u201d\n\nLet Your Characters Write Themselves\n\n\u201cIt sounds insane, but I\u2019ve heard enough writers say it that I guess we\u2019re all collectively insane in the same way if we have fictional people making choices for us,\u201d says Alafair Burke, author of the Ellie Hatcher series and other suspense bestsellers. \u201cMy book The Wife is about a woman whose husband is accused of sexual misconduct, and she doesn\u2019t know whether she believes him or not. When I started that book, all I knew was who she was. I knew why she didn\u2019t want to be in the spotlight. I knew what her secrets were, and I knew that his scandal was going to drag her secrets out, but I had no idea what his scandal was going to be. I didn\u2019t know what his job was. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to get accused of. I didn\u2019t know if he had actually done it or not.\n\nBut I knew her, and once I figured out who she would be drawn to \u2014 this kind of cocky, confident guy \u2014 I was like, \u2018Oh, I know!\u2019 Then the book almost wrote itself, because the things I didn\u2019t know, she didn\u2019t know either.\u201d\n\nDo Your Homework\n\n\u201cI might print out like one hundred articles from LexisNexis,\u201d says Attica Locke, who has written a series of novels set in Texas. \u201cAs I read them, I began to understand what matters to this community, what\u2019s interesting about this community, what has been a problem in this community, and somehow the crime that this thing is going to be centered on in the book begins to emerge and tell itself to me. It comes back to me as I read, read, read about what would actually happen in a place like this. I am not a writer who feels like everything has to be so research perfect, but it needs to feel like, no, this is some shit that could probably happen here.\u201d\n\nDiscuss Corpses Over Lunch (Quietly)\n\n\u201cSpending hours and hours doing research can be a bit of a trap,\u201d says Burke. \u201cYou tell yourself you\u2019re working on your book, and you\u2019re really just going down a rabbit hole. You may as well just yell on Twitter with that time. I try to crystallize what I need and I\u2019ll often skip a scene, telling myself I need to talk to a pathologist or something before I write it. There\u2019s a writer named Jonathan Hayes \u2014 he works with the medical examiner\u2019s office, but he\u2019s also a writer. He must be in a lot of people\u2019s acknowledgements at this point. We\u2019ll meet up for a meal, and be having some beautifully constructed little tomato dish while talking about cutting someone\u2019s head off. Definitely some sideways glances at the restaurant.\u201d\n\nFind Inspiration IRL \u2026\n\n\u201cMy latest book came out a few months before Trump was elected, says Lisa Lutz of her mystery, The Swallows. \u201cThinking back to when I was writing it, I want to say that it would still ultimately be the same book, but it probably wouldn\u2019t because I was so out-of-my-mind angry. I can\u2019t remember ever being so angry. That book was about a gender war and egregious male behavior and women being complicit in that. It was my attempt to shed light on things. Of course, even in a normal time, I would still approach a plot or a story with, \u2018What am I obsessed with, what have I not seen?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2026 And Then Avoid Google\n\n\u201cI will confess,\u201d says Lippman, \u201cthat I have extremely complicated and ambivalent feelings about the podcast true-crime boom. I always tell people I\u2019m inspired by real life stories but they\u2019re not ripped from the headlines. I\u2019m not trying to give people the inside scoop on what really happened. As a matter of fact, if I\u2019m inspired by a real life story, I immediately curtail any research into it because I don\u2019t want to be influenced by it.\n\nTry the Dartboard Method\n\n\u201cI start with the bullseye,\u201d says Anthony Horowitz, creator of the Alex Rider spy novels. \u201cThe bullseye is two people, or three people if it\u2019s a double murder. It is the killer and the victim. I ask myself: what makes that completely unique? What hasn\u2019t been done? And then I build around that.\n\nLet\u2019s say the killer is a dentist. I\u2019ll start thinking, well, the dentist has patients, and the dentist has a hygienist and possibly a receptionist, and these are all people who have stories that connect to the dentist. And then the victim might be \u2026 I don\u2019t know what the victim is, but he or she also has these \u2026 And these other layers are stories because that\u2019s all a murder mystery is. It\u2019s merely human beings brought together in violent circumstances. I\u2019m looking for all the different human stories, and I build them in a sort of an outward going spiral. So you\u2019re building up to this dartboard that will finally have the triples scores, and the double scores, and it\u2019ll be a large, circular thing. But it all rests on the bullseye at the middle.\u201d\n\nYou Don\u2019t Have to Write An Outline \u2026\n\n\u201cWhen I don\u2019t use an outline, my books become longer,\u201d says Locke. \u201cThey\u2019re more fun to write because I like writing to feel like being a reader. I don\u2019t want to know what\u2019s going to happen. If I had an outline from jump, I don\u2019t know that I would write the book because I know what happens.\n\nI mean, let me be clear: it makes me fucking miserable.\n\nBut I also love it. I have that neurotic dance of, \u201cOh, this is just so great\u201d and also, \u201cThis is terrible, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\n\u2026 Or Maybe Write Many Outlines\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be doing many, many drafts for a novel, but you can do many, many drafts of the outline,\u201d says Michaelides. \u201cI did that for a very long time and then tried to sort of see how to bring it to life. But I do outline an awful lot, particularly with this kind of novel, where it\u2019s about the architecture of it.\u201d\n\nEasy On The Twists\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to build your whole book around twists,\u201d says Megan Abbott, whose female-centered thrillers include The Fever and Give Me Your Hand. \u201cLike if it doesn\u2019t work without the twist, if you still wouldn\u2019t be engaged in the story that we\u2019re telling \u2026 it\u2019s just a gimmick. You always want to have moments of surprise for the reader and you want to do a little sleight of hand. It\u2019s part of the intense relationship with the reader that you have. But I never want to be writing toward just some sort of an aha moment.\u201d\n\nArts and Crafts Can Help\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit known for an insane thing I do,\u201d says Lippman. \u201cWhen I\u2019m about midway through my novel I go to a craft store and buy something. One never knows what it will be, and I create these non-text outlines of my books so I can just sort of sit there and look at them and see if I can see imbalances and things that aren\u2019t working based on these really weird color-coded designs I create. One time I even created a song for my novel, which is: I assigned musical notes to the points of view and then I would play the song and see if it sounded pleasant.\u201d\n\nWhen All Else Fails, Go to the Movies\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I call the Don Draper Principle,\u201d says Abbott, \u201cbecause he always did that on Mad Men. I tend to see something usually horror, something that completely demands my attention and is very big and spectacle-oriented, because it can knock me out of what I\u2019m thinking about in a good way. Or sometimes it\u2019s just reading a book that has no relation to what I\u2019m doing, but will just get me creatively excited. It\u2019s the same principle \u2014 it gets me out of a bad head space.\u201d\n\n*An earlier version of this piece misspelled Alafair Burke\u2019s name.", "description": "To learn more about the elements of great mystery architecture, Vulture asked eight masters of the form to anatomize their thinking, from the most conceptual level down to the technical details.", "authors": ["Madison Malone Kircher"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-murder-she-wrote.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
