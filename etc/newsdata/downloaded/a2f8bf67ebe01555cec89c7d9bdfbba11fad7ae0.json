You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis marks the latest milestone in the rapid decarbonisation of the UK\u2019s electricity system.\n\nDr Simon Evans, deputy editor of Carbon Brief, told The Independent: \u201cThe UK has made significant progress in cutting its CO2 emissions over the past decade.\n\n\u201cAlmost all of that progress is thanks to the electricity sector, which as our analysis shows has seen fossil fuel generation halve since 2010 and renewables increase more than fourfold.\n\n\u201cOther parts of the economy have made very little progress. The UK will not be able to meet its legally-binding carbon targets in future without emissions cuts in other areas, such as heating and transport,\u201d he said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

fossil fuels, 28.4TWh came from gas, 0.4TWh came from coal and 0.3TWh from oil, according to the analysis of national statistics from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS).\n\nThere are now just seven coal-fired power stations left in the UK, with the last one set to close by 2025.\n\nOut of the 29.5TWh from renewable sources of energy, 14.6TWh came from wind, 8.8TWh from biomass, 4.7TWh from solar and 1.4TWh came from hydropower.\n\nThis is part of a growing trend and in the first three quarters of this year, renewables did better than fossil fuels on 103 out of 273 of the days.\n\nHowever, despite huge success in the electricity sector, other parts of the economy have made little progress in reducing emissions.\n\nLast year 6.8tns of greenhouse gases were emitted per person and by 2050 this will need to have dropped to zero.\n\nThe Committee on Climate Change\u2019s (CCC) annual report to parliament showed UK action to slash greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change is lagging far behind what is needed.\n\nBEIS was awarded \u00a330m extra in the latest spending round to \u201caccelerate progress\u201d on decarbonisation projects next year.\n\nHowever, this was just 0.1 per cent of what is required, according to Britain\u2019s biggest environmental groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth.", "description": "UK
