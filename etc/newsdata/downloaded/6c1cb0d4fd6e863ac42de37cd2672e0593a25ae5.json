The State reserves the right to disclose additional witnesses if they become material.'\n\nKhoury told The Telegraph: 'He didn't just do it once, it wasn't just like a pat on the butt \u2013 which would be bad enough \u2013 he would pat her butt and then feel her butt and then he'd move his hand away, and Katie would try to move a little, and then he did it again, and then he did it again. It was bizarre really.\n\n'She's a wife and a mother and she doesn't deserve that.'\n\nKhoury told police Green had an 'octopus-like hand', according to records. She claims to have reported his alleged behavior to ranch management.\n\nSince the charges were announced, other women working at a spa in Canyon Ranch have come forward to accuse Green of inappropriate behavior.\n\nIn July, Jennifer McAmis, a 30-year-old fitness instructor, claimed she had to wear extra layers of clothing because Sir Philip was so 'grabby'.\n\nAt least one more worker has also made official complaints about his behavior, it is understood.\n\nGreen still owns a luxury mansion near to the spa resort, but has been banned from using either the spa and gym.\n\nHe was absent from court in August following a successful appeal by his lawyers to prevent an appearance. Ms Surridge made an appearance at Pima County Justice Court in Tucson, Arizona with her husband and legal team to listen to the short hearing.\n\nAnother court date, at which evidence may be brought, has been set for October 23.\n\nKhoury lives a few doors down from Green at the Canyon Ranch health club in Tucson, Arizona\n\nKhoury, 55, said in February she saw Green repeatedly 'fondling' Surridge's, pictured, bottom\n\nSpeaking after police launched their investigation, Ms Surridge accused Sir Philip of 'hiding behind expensive lawyers'.\n\n'Sir Philip needs to come to the US and face up to what he did,' the mother of three told the Telegraph.\n\nIt is believed prosecutors may offer the billionaire a plea deal in return for an admission of guilt, with each of the four counts carrying up to 30 days imprisonment.\n\nHowever the consequences of a guilty plea may reach further, and could pressure the UK government into stripping Green of his knighthood.", "description": "Kimberley Khoury has been named by prosecutors after the Topshop boss Green, left, was accused of 'repeatedly fondling' the bottom of pilates coach Katie Surridge, right.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/03/19520862-0-image-a-66_1570673502544.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
