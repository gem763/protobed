Moreover, Farrow said Weinstein successfully threatened to go public with allegations against Lauer if the network aired stories about him. He also told the story of Brooke Nevils, a former assistant to Meredith Vieira, who claimed staffers in the news division and colleagues (not human resources) long ignored her claim that Lauer raped her in 2014.\n\n(Both Weinstein, who was fired from his company in October 2017 and faces a sexual assault trail in January, and Lauer, who was fired in November 2017 the day after Nevils took her complaint to the human resources department, have denied the sexual misconduct allegations against them.)\n\nIn a memo to staff, obtained by Yahoo Entertainment, Lack called the new details \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct in 2014 was appalling and reprehensible \u2014 and of course we said so at the time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe first moment we learned of it was the night of November 27, 2017, and he was fired in 24 hours. Any suggestion that we knew prior to that evening or tried to cover up any aspect of Lauer\u2019s conduct is absolutely false and offensive.\u201d\n\nLack said the company conducted an investigation after Lauer\u2019s departure and found no claims or settlements related to inappropriate conduct by the host. At the same time, employees have been required to take anti-harassment training.\n\nReferring to the Weinstein situation, Lack was adamant that Farrow \u201cuses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture.\u201d He accused Farrow, who won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for his reporting on the Weinstein scandal at the New Yorker, for having fallen below company standards, even after a substantial investment of resources.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAfter seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, [Farrow] simply didn\u2019t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization. Not willing to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by the New York Times, he asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away. Reluctantly, we allowed him to go ahead.\u201d\n\nFarrow\u2019s report was published in the New Yorker 53 days after he left NBC.\n\nHowever, Lack said that report \u201cbore little resemblance to the reporting he had while at NBC News.\u201d\n\nNBC News issued a statement regarding the Lauer: \u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\nThey also denied the suggestion the company had shielded Weinstein for any reason.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
