The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office identified her as 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson.\n\nThe officer does not identify himself as police in the video. Police said the officer, who's been on the force since April 2018, was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation.\n\nOfficials have not released the officer's name.\n\n190514162535499\n\nIn the statement, police said the responding officers saw a person near the window inside the home. The officer fired the single shot after \"perceiving a threat,\" the statement said. The bodycam video also included images of a gun inside the residence, but it's unclear if the firearm was found near the woman.\n\nNeighbour James Smith, who initially called police, told the Star-Telegram he was just trying to be a good neighbour.\n\n\"I'm shaken. I'm mad. I'm upset. And I feel it's partly my fault,\" Smith said. \"If I had never dialed the police department, she'd still be alive.\"\n\nSmith said Jefferson and her 8-year-old nephew typically lived with an older woman, who's been in the hospital. \"It makes you not want to call the police department,\" the neighbour said.\n\nLocal activists held a press conference on Saturday, asking the city to hold the officer who fired the shot accountable. Pastor BR Daniels Jr said he wants the police department to stop what he called \"shooting first, asking questions later\".\n\n\"We want a review of policy, procedures. How do you storm a house, kill a young lady, with an 8-year-old minor in the house, who could have been killed himself,\" Daniels said.\n\nMany took to social media to express their grief and call for accountability.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson was shot and killed in her own home by police who unjustly fired rounds through her bedroom window.\n\n\n\nMy heart hurts. The lethal weaponization of our civic institutions against Black bodies cannot continue. We need justice. #SayHerName pic.twitter.com/3thC97sBY9 \u2014 Isaac Bryan (@ib2_real) October 13, 2019\n\nUNACCEPTABLE! The acts of yet another \u201ctrained\u201d police officer have resulted in the death of #AtatianaJefferson. Gun downed in her own home. If we are not safe to call the police, if we are not safe in our homes, where can we find peace? We demand answers. We demand justice. pic.twitter.com/UZqHQzPyaW \u2014 NAACP (@NAACP) October 13, 2019\n\nI seriously can\u2019t believe this. We just finished the #BothamJean trial in DFW. #AtatianaJefferson was in her home playing games with her 8 year old nephew, and a cop shot her dead through her window in 3 seconds. These cannot be dismissed as tragic mistakes. These lives matter. pic.twitter.com/89HmVrIxQL \u2014 Omar Suleiman (@omarsuleiman504) October 13, 2019\n\nAuthorities said the bodycam footage was released soon after the shooting to provide transparency, but any video taken inside the house could not be distributed due to state law.\n\nThe shooting comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison for killing her black neighbour inside his own apartment. Amber Guyger said during her trial that mistook Botham Jean's apartment for her own, which was one floor below Jean's.\n\nGuyger, 31, was convicted of murder for Jean's September 2018 death.", "description": "Police fatally shoot 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson through window of her home after a request to check on her welfare.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/13/8c4301d7a4a040ecbbf55b31ab2836e1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
