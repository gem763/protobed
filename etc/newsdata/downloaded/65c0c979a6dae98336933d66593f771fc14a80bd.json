Trump appealed within minutes, and an appeals court put the case on hold until it can hear the president\u2019s challenge.\n\nBut Monday\u2019s ruling by U.S. Judge Victor Marrero was still a broad rejection of Trump\u2019s precedent-shattering argument in this case.\n\nThe president argued that, as long as he is president, he cannot be investigated by any prosecutor, anywhere, for any reason.\n\nMarrero said that was \u201crepugnant\u201d to an American ideal as old as the Constitution: that no man, even a president, is above the law.\n\n\u201cThe Court cannot square a vision of presidential immunity that would place the President above the law with the text of the Constitution, the historical record, the relevant case law\u201d or any other authority, Marrero wrote.\n\n\u201cThis Court cannot endorse such a categorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process,\u201d Marrero wrote in another section of his 75-page ruling.\n\nTrump reacted on Twitter, writing that Democrats \u201chave failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democratic prosecutors to go get President Trump. A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\u201d\n\nJay Sekulow, a private attorney for the president, struck a more positive tone: \u201cWe are very pleased that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has issued a stay of the subpoena.\u201d\n\nThe lower court decision marked a key setback for Trump, who has taken an unorthodox, aggressive approach to fighting off investigations from prosecutors and congressional committees seeking his tax returns and financial documents. He has sued the investigators and the companies they subpoenaed, including his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA and two of Trump\u2019s banks.\n\nJudges have ruled against Trump twice in other cases, but those lawsuits are still tied up in appeals in New York and Washington, and the subpoenas have not been enforced.\n\nIn this lawsuit, Trump said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. (D) did not need eight years of his tax returns to examine whether any laws were broken by the 2016 payments. He called the subpoena to Mazars \u201ca bad faith effort to harass the President by obtaining and exposing his private financial information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law.\u201d\n\n[Who is William S. Consovoy? A profile of the private lawyer making the case to protect Trump\u2019s interests.]\n\nThe judge\u2019s opinion Monday raised the prospect that by seeking to vastly expand his immunity from prosecution, Trump may wind up undercutting the immunity he already enjoyed.\n\nThe Justice Department has previously declared that presidents cannot be indicted by federal prosecutors, relying on a series of legal memos from White House lawyers going back to the 1970s.\n\nIn this case, Trump had sought to turn those protections into a more far-reaching legal shield. Citing those memos, he asserted he should have immunity not just from indictment, but also any sort of investigation \u2014 and not just from federal prosecutors, but local prosecutors like Vance, too.\n\nBut Marrero, nominated to the bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton, rejected both arguments \u2014 and also questioned the Justice Department memos they relied on. He wrote that the arguments they made rely on \u201cconjurings of remote prospects and hyperbolic horrors\u201d and that \u2014 in some cases \u2014 indicting a president may be worth the cost.\n\nFor its part, the Justice Department has filed a brief supporting Trump in this case \u2014 urging Marrero to consider Trump\u2019s arguments, without explicitly endorsing his argument that he cannot be investigated by anyone.\n\nSoon after the ruling, the president\u2019s lawyers quickly turned to the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for help and raised the prospect of going directly to the Supreme Court if the 2nd Circuit did not act swiftly.\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers called the investigation unprecedented and said in their filing Monday that the case raises novel, consequential questions about \u201cthe scope of the President\u2019s constitutional immunity from state criminal process.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time in our nation\u2019s history, a county prosecutor has subjected the sitting President of the United States to criminal process,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers told the appeals court.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s objective, they wrote, \u201ccould not be any clearer: he wants to obtain the President\u2019s financial records before this Court (and the Supreme Court) have any opportunity to review whether the subpoena is constitutional.\u201d\n\nAt the 2nd Circuit, a clerk ordered that the subpoenas be put on hold until judges could hear the arguments in an expedited proceeding. Both the president and Vance\u2019s office asked the court to quickly schedule oral arguments to happen before the end of the month.\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers pressed for speedy review by the appeals court in part because of time constraints. The district attorney had agreed to stay the subpoena only until 1 p.m. Monday, and Vance would have been allowed to enforce the order had the appeals court not acted.\n\nIn contrast, in the two pending cases involving congressional subpoenas for the president\u2019s financial records, lawyers for the House have agreed to put those orders on hold until the appeals are resolved.\n\n[Trump sues Manhattan prosecutor to block subpoena for tax returns]\n\nVance is investigating payments made in the last weeks of the 2016 campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Trump years earlier. Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations for arranging those payments, and he said he had been reimbursed by the Trump Organization, which the president still owns. Federal prosecutors later concluded their investigation into those payments without charging anyone beyond Cohen.\n\nNow, Vance\u2019s office is investigating to see whether any state laws were violated. Its subpoenas asked for eight years of tax returns from Trump and his businesses, as well as other documents. Vance has said that, at this stage of the investigation, Trump \u201chas not been identified as a defendant, nor is there an assumption he will be.\u201d", "description": "The request for eight years of records relates to the district attorney\u2019s investigation into hush-money payments during the 2016 election.", "authors": ["David A.
