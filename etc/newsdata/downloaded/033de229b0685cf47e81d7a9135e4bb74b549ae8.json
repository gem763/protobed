Me!\u2019: An aggrieved Trump spins an alternate reality as impeachment probe escalates", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI feel there was in the 2016 campaign \u2014 there was tremendous corruption against me,\u201d said Trump, transforming himself \u2014 a man who has now publicly asked no fewer than three foreign countries (Russia, Ukraine and China) to look into his political opponents \u2014 into the victim of corrupt behavior.\n\nAD\n\nAnd he was just getting started.\n\n\u201cI was investigated, I was investigated, okay?\u201d he said, before pointing at himself \u2014 two rapid-fire taps to his right breast \u2014 and adding: \u201cMe! Me!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLive updates of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump\n\nHe barked at the media that it was he who ran, he who won, he who was investigated, before accusing the assembled press: \u201cYou won\u2019t say that, will you?\u201d\n\nFinally, he began wrapping up: \u201cI was investigated. I was investigated. And they think it could have been by U.K. They think it could have been by Australia. They think it could have been by Italy. So when you get down to it, I was investigated by the Obama administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the Obama administration,\u201d he concluded, shouting now, and using both hands to point at himself, \u201cI was investigated.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was unclear, exactly, to which unfounded, unproven theory Trump was referring.\n\nPerhaps he was incorrectly claiming that Barack Obama\u2019s administration was investigating him. In fact, the FBI opened investigations into several of his campaign aides \u2014 including Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, both foreign policy advisers \u2014 but not actually Trump himself.\n\nAD\n\nOr maybe he was conflating Christopher Steele \u2014 a former British intelligence officer who during the 2016 campaign compiled a dossier of damaging information on then-candidate Trump \u2014 with the British government itself.\n\nBut either way, Trump was angry, and his rambling question-and-answer session seemed to convey an essential truth: That he considers it fair game for him ask foreign governments to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u2014 who, Trump claimed again with no evidence, were the perpetrators of \u201ctremendous corruption.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe president has long been comfortable with conspiracy theories. His political rise was abetted by the racist lie of birtherism \u2014 the false claim that Obama was not born in the United States. But ever since special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia probe, and now amid the throes of an impeachment inquiry, Trump seems to have moved into a split-screen reality \u2014 one in which he is the hero who has, as he tweeted Thursday, the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to do just about anything he pleases.\n\nAD\n\nAnalysis: 3 deeply problematic aspects of the texts on Ukraine\n\nAnd his South Lawn session Friday again laid bare the incongruity between actual facts and what the president espouses.\n\nTrump repeatedly insisted that he was not worried about Biden as a possible 2020 rival \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s campaign, but I do care about corruption,\u201d he said \u2014 a claim undermined by the fact that Trump fixated on Biden, mentioning the former vice president more than two dozen times.\n\nAD\n\nThe president as caped anti-corruption crusader is also undermined by his own previous behavior. He refused to condemn and was slow to dismiss some of his own Cabinet officials, including former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt and former interior secretary Ryan Zinke, amid ethical lapses and controversy. Unlike previous presidents, both Democratic and Republican, Trump has often expressed admiration and fondness for dictators, rather than pressuring them to improve their record on human rights.\n\nAD\n\nHe again claimed his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 during which he asked that the Ukrainians dig up dirt on Biden as \u201ca favor\u201d \u2014 was \u201cperfect,\u201d and that when he released notes from the conversation, the reaction was positive.\n\n\u201cThey say, \u2018Wow, this is incredible,\u2019 \u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of that call.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, even some of his Republican allies have been reticent to publicly defend the content of the call, and on Friday, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), a former GOP presidential nominee, criticized Trump in a duo of tweets.\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney wrote. \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nTrump also falsely claimed that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the president\u2019s phone call with Zelensky was \u201cwonderful.\u201d Though McConnell did defend Trump in a statement to Politico, saying the Democrats had \u201calready overplayed their hand\u201d by using the phone call to launch an impeachment inquiry, he was hardly effusive about Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky.\n\nThe president also accused Hunter Biden of taking \u201ca billion and a half dollars out of China.\u201d He seemed to be referring to the sum of money that a private-equity company based in China had said it hoped to raise. Hunter Biden became a board member of the firm, BHR Partners, in 2013, and later acquired a 10 percent interest in the entity overseeing the fund \u2014 but his lawyer has described Trump\u2019s allegations against him as \u201ca gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden\u2019s role with BHR.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurning his attention to Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, Trump described that probe as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe went through two years of Mueller, and that came out like a 10,\u201d the president said.\n\nEven many of Trump\u2019s most stalwart allies, however, privately are unlikely to describe Mueller\u2019s investigation and subsequent report as having been ideal for the president.\n\nThough Mueller determined that current Justice Department policy prevented him from concluding whether Trump committed a crime, he did lay out possible evidence of obstruction of justice by the president in his final 448-page report and noted that \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d\n\nTrump did, however, utter at least one thing that seemed to be unambiguous.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been president now for almost three years, and I\u2019ve been going through this for almost three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost become like a part of my day.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The president has long been comfortable with conspiracy theories, but seems to have moved deeper into a split-screen reality \u2014 where he is the hero with the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to do what he pleases.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nOt-0lTglTYev--QM9GDv0_3m-k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OA3B5UXG6AI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
