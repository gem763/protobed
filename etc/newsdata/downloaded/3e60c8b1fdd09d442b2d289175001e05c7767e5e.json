The company also applied for up to 5,900 units of new housing, more than the 5,000 units previously described.\n\nThe expanded ranges allow the company and city greater flexibility as it seeks feedback in the months leading up to a final approval vote next year, company spokesperson Michael Appel told CNBC. Appel added that just because the company increased ranges in certain areas, it won't necessarily develop the maximum space.\n\nThe formal proposal comes as Google needs additional space for its rapidly expanding workforce, which is already busting at the seams of its existing headquarters and surrounding offices. The company also faces pressure from local constituents who fear its growth will further contribute to the already-tight housing market, which is among the country's most expensive.", "description": "Google's application show its second headquarters, which have caused controversy on the local housing crunch, could be bigger than expected.", "authors": ["Jennifer Elias"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102463973-GOOGLE3.jpg?v=1425062392", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
