The government (at both the state and federal level) has been sticking its beak into the concept of marriage pretty much since the founding of the nation. We went through many iterations of what the government could and couldn\u2019t regulate over the generations, with the trend always being toward fewer restrictions. Prohibitions against interracial marriage were done away with, as well as interfaith marriages in some states. The last big change was, of course, the prohibition against same-sex marriages. But is there one definition left that may be going the way of the dodo? How about the idea that marriage must, by definition, be between two people, with any number greater than two constituting bigamy, which is still illegal?\n\nJohn Hirschauer at National Review tackled that challenge this week. While he\u2019s clearly against any more changes (and some of the previous ones, I presume), he seems to feel that a challenge demanding polyamorous (or plural) marriages might survive in the courts.\n\nThe majority in Obergefell did not find the fact that the West, for at least two millennia, held a stable conception of marriage \u2014 a union between one man and one woman, open to procreation and the rearing of children \u2014 compelling grounds to reject the claims of the plaintiffs. Obergefell clearly conceives of marriage as a \u201cright\u201d \u2014 civil, legal, and moral \u2014 to be extended to consenting claimants, with only passing regard for the existing strictures of the institution. Anthony Kennedy\u2019s opinion uses a nebulous, inchoate definition of marriage predicated on poetic notions of \u201cdignity\u201d and \u201clove\u201d rather than the traditional, unbroken consensus of Western civilization. Why would the Court find the traditional restriction of marriage to a union between two persons a compelling reason to withhold the right to marry from three (or more) claimants? If \u201clove,\u201d \u201cdignity,\u201d and the pursuant tax advantages are the constitutive parts of marriage, on what grounds would Rauch or the courts withhold those \u201crights\u201d from polygamous unions?\n\nHirschauer\u2019s analysis is full of good legal research combined with a healthy bit of snark, scoffing at the idea of plural marriage but clearly concerned that recent court rulings have built a bridge to polygamous marriage that might withstand any assault. And while I respect his religious beliefs, I find myself asking\u2026 why not?\n\nYes, the idea of polygamous marriage sounds silly to me because I also grew up understanding that marriage was a union between two people. Generally, two people with different plumbing, to boot. But when I force myself to consider the question on its raw merits, I find myself going back to my opinion on gay marriage, which I published here many times during that whole debate. I\u2019ll summarize it again here briefly. When asked if I \u201csupport gay marriage\u201d I generally always responded as follows:\n\nNo, I don\u2019t support gay marriage. I don\u2019t support straight marriage. I support my marriage and the rest of you are pretty much on your own. What I remain opposed to is the idea that the government \u2013 at any level \u2013 can demand a permission slip in the form of a license and charge a tax, calling it a fee, to receive a blessing from the government for two people to engage in a private ceremony before family and friends that affects nobody else on the planet.\n\nMind you, that\u2019s only for the ceremonial \u201ctitle\u201d of being married. Questions of tax benefits or burdens, inheritance and all of the other baggage that goes along with it can be handled contractually whether you are married or not. When pressed for a solution to the previous conundrum, I always suggested that the word \u201cmarriage\u201d be stripped from the tax codes entirely and from almost every other law as well. (I say \u201calmost\u201d because the government should still maintain the ability to protect the underage, the mentally impaired and others who can\u2019t give meaningful consent from the possibility of marriage being used as a fig leaf to cover abuse.) But since our current government would never agree to all that, approving gay marriage was probably the only other choice, though far inferior to simply getting the government out of the business of marriage.\n\nBut if that\u2019s my position (and it\u2019s one I\u2019ve been satisfied with for quite some time now), how can I justify the portion of that speech where I specify \u201ctwo people to engage in a private ceremony?\u201d As I said, the concept of a polyamorous relationship remains completely foreign and mystifying to me. I\u2019ve barely been able to struggle along seeing to the needs and/or demands of one woman these past 25 years. The idea of doing that for two would leave me in a panic-induced coma.\n\nBut that\u2019s just me. Who am I to say that three people couldn\u2019t engage in such a private ceremony? More to the point, who is the government to say? I would fall back on the fundamental basis for how our governments should determine when a law is valid to pass. If we are to restrict the actions of free individual citizens, we should be able to answer one question. Is the action to be prohibited causing harm to or restricting the rights of other citizens? If the answer is yes it\u2019s fair game for being restricted under law. If the answer is no, well\u2026 you\u2019ve got a lot of explaining to do.\n\nWith that in mind, I would still never consider marrying more than one person. But I\u2019m not sure the government should restrict it if that\u2019s what they really want to do.", "description": "And if they can, should they?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/wedding.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
