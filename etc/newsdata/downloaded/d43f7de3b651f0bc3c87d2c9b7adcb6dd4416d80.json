USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The St. Louis Cardinals could use some good karma heading into Game 3 of the National League Championship Series.\n\nFacing a 2-0 deficit to the Washington Nationals, maybe the Cardinals should have their pitching coach fill out the lineup.\n\nWhy?\n\nMike Maddux, who served the same role with the Nationals from 2016-17, hit the links before Monday's game and made two holes-in-one while playing at the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n\"Hit two holes-in-ones in the same round,\" Cardinals manager Mike Shildt dropped at the pregame press conference. \"He had two today.\"\n\nMike Maddux is the pitching coach for the St. Louis Cardinals.

And it's only happened three times on the PGA Tour.\n\nShildt said he didn't witness the feat, but said president of baseball operations John Mozeliak was Maddux's playing partner. The two aces came at hole No. 3 (186 yards) on the White Course and No. 4 (142 yards) on the Blue Course.\n\nFor the record, Maddux now has made six holes-in-one.", "description": "Mike Maddux, the Cardinals pitching coach, played a round of golf before Game 3 of the NLCS and made two-holes-in-one.", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published P.M.
