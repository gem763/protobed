Below, there is a miniature reconstruction of the dramatic lobby that greets visitors from Fifth Avenue -- it is hidden away in the finished model, but seen by the Lego builder. \"So behind the building's instructions booklet, while you're building, you have this little call-out that alludes to some of the features of the original.\"\n\nIn the newer Skylines series, there is much more \"artistic liberty,\" Kobe said.\n\nFor San Francisco, the designers ignored real-world distances, using forced perspective to create something more like a caricature, that brings Alcatraz Island, the Golden Gate Bridge and the famous Painted Ladies row houses into a pleasing arrangement.\n\n\"It's a fake perspective. You have this collection of views,\" Kobe said. \"It's all the little details, the tram on the hilly street and whatnot, that set the stage for the San Francisco.\"\n\nFrom the adventurous to avant-garde\n\nWhile whole cities are being given the official Lego treatment, dedicated fans of the plastic bricks are creating their own versions of famed buildings and local landmarks.\n\nTom Alphin, the author of \"The Lego Architect,\" said fan-made kits are a big undertaking, with designers taking responsibility for everything from bulk-buying bricks and hand-dividing them into kits, to writing instructions and designing packaging.\n\nBought and sold at conventions or on Lego fan sites like Brick Loot, the fan-made world is a gray market of hazardous spikes and taboo \"illegal connections\" that force pieces together in unconventional ways. \"The true custom fan kits can really go off the rails,\" said Alphin.\n\nVilla Amanzi, Phuket, Thailand, 2008, Original Vision Ltd.

They have to ensure that their designs meet Lego's house rules, including safety standards that ensure models don't impale a child falling on them, for example -- a serious consideration when working with skyline-dominating spikes like the Eiffel Tower and Seattle's Space Needle.\n\nDesigners of fan-made kits, however, are free to indulge their passions, no matter how niche, like the miniature Aarhus City Hall created by Danish architects Arne Jacobsen and Erik M\u00f8ller, who used their skills to miniaturize the hall's distinctive clock tower.\n\nFans have also attempted ambitious architectural styles, like Norman Foster's high-tech HSBC building in Hong Kong to the Gothic curves of Paris' Notre Dame cathedral.\n\nNakagin Capsule Tower, Tokyo, Japan, 1972, Kisho Kurokawa.

For Lego designers, these architects' works represent the greatest challenge -- \"the cutting edge\" -- he added.\n\nOne recent fan submission on the Lego Ideas website is an impressive attempt at the Milwaukee Art Museum, a criss-crossing, sail-shaped building by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava that Alphin said has become a surprising test of mettle for Lego fan-designers.\n\nSantiago Calatrava's Milwaukee Art Museum pavilion, a fan creation posted to LEGO Ideas by fan Vida Andras.

Everything else should then fall into place.\n\nCommunity collaboration\n\nThe concept of using Lego bricks to inform future design was the subject of a recent exhibition, \"The Cubic Structural Evolution Project,\" at London's Tate Modern gallery.\n\nDanish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson deposited a truckload of white building blocks in the Turbine Hall, the gigantic exhibition space at the center of museum, and invited people to build a \"city of the future\" along two 10-meter-long tables shaped like a map of London.\n\nOlafur Eliasson's \"The Cubic Structural Evolution Project\" was at London's Tate Modern from 26 July to 18 August 2019.

Credit: Tate/Joe Humphrys\n\nFor all the impressiveness of the true-to-life kits, that freedom to experiment without consequence is a solid foundation for the collaboration between architects and Lego.\n\nGodfrey said the exhibition brought together people of all ages and backgrounds to celebrate the fun of Lego, as he remembered it as a child in the 1970s.\n\n\"You're free to build whatever you want,\" he said. \"It's about creative building rather than following instructions.\"", "description": "Many architects now shaping the world's cities acknowledge a debt to Lego, the Danish toy company behind the plastic bricks that have littered bedroom floors for more than 50 years.", "authors": ["Matthew Ponsford"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190821162845-lego-architecture-ideas-super-tease.jpg"}
