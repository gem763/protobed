Warmer air and water are expected to increase the intensity of storms and the rainfall they produce, scientists say. Dorian\u2019s characteristics\u2014slow, meandering and ferocious\u2014compounded the problem.\n\nAfter tearing through the Bahamas and strafing the Carolina Coast, the storm made landfall in Nova Scotia, Canada, on Saturday, causing damage and power outages.\n\nMore accurate data gives more time for emergency planners and residents in a storm\u2019s potential track to prepare. But, meteorologists and researchers say, the long lead-up also can result in saturation storm coverage and social-media hype that leads some people to tune out.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center\u2019s first advisory on the storm came out Aug. 24, nearly two weeks before it made U.S. landfall in North Carolina. That long lead time, along with the devastation it caused as it parked itself over the northwestern Bahamas, increased anxiety in the U.S.\n\nFor many in Florida and other states along the Eastern Seaboard, the hurricane didn\u2019t end up being the catastrophic event they had feared in the long lead time.\n\nFlorida resident Josephine Hillyer said incessant speculation on TV and online about whether Hurricane Dorian was coming made her panicky at first, and then dazed. \u201cWe knew, and we didn\u2019t know, we knew, and we didn\u2019t know, back and forth,\u201d said the 55-year-old retiree in Micco on the central coast, south of Melbourne. In the end, she and her husband prepared by boarding up their house and stocking up on water, food and fuel.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has hired social scientists to help craft messages about storm hazards aimed at resonating more effectively with people and prodding them to action if necessary. A staff guide on risk communication published by the agency in July included suggestions such as using a serious but not preachy tone and helping people feel confident that they can take action to mitigate risk.\n\n\u201cClear perception of the hazard means you\u2019re not paralyzed before it\u2019s too late to do anything,\u201d said Hugh Willoughby, a professor at Florida International University and former director of NOAA\u2019s hurricane research division.\n\nBut communicating risk to people in potentially affected areas is tricky, researchers say. A 2018 study of coastal Florida residents in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction found \u201cthe persistence of misunderstandings\u201d of forecast cones and other hurricane communication tools. It also noted that continual storm coverage was a source of annoyance for many and led to fatigue for some, adding to concerns that information overload would lead them to miss key communications.\n\nErrors in the forecast track this decade are about half the magnitude they had in the 1990s, according to the hurricane center. In recent years, the center has developed new tools and graphics, like one showing the arrival time of tropical-storm-force winds and another showing areas under storm-surge watches and warnings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always trying to improve the models\u2026in concert with emergency managers,\u201d said Joel Cline, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center.\n\nHurricane modeling has steadily advanced with the help of sophisticated satellites and powerful computers. In 2003, the National Hurricane Center first began issuing a five-day forecast cone, up from three days. In 2010, the center increased the lead time for tropical-cyclone watches and warnings by 12 hours, to 48 hours and 36 hours, respectively. A hurricane watch means hurricane conditions are possible, while a warning means they are expected.\n\nBrevard County, Fla., on the state\u2019s central coast, began preparing for Dorian on Aug. 26, more than a week before it neared, said Kimberly Prosser, the county\u2019s director of emergency management. Staff gathered data on flood-prone areas, conferred with the local National Weather Service office and drew up contingency plans.\n\n\u201cThe more information we have, the better we can prepare,\u201d Ms. Prosser said, adding that even if the preparations aren\u2019t needed in the end, there is no choice but to be ready.\n\nMeteorologists from Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy Corp. drew on forecasts and their own model developed in house to estimate the number of customer outages and calculate how many utility crews would be needed to restore power, as well as when and where to stage them. Planners adjusted as new storm data came in, said Sarah Wambles, Duke\u2019s director of reliability engineering.\n\nAhead of Dorian, Duke moved in 4,000 repair workers from 23 states and Canada to North Carolina and South Carolina to supplement the 5,000 workers based in the two states, which suffered extensive outages.\n\nJason Hansen, a 48-year-old maintenance worker in Sebastian, Fla., said he has been through at least a half-dozen hurricanes. \u201cThe further notice, the better,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t turn out to be anything, it\u2019s better to be prepared.\u201d", "description": "Scientists have forecasts further ahead of a storm but need to communicate so people prepare and don\u2019t tune out.", "authors": ["Arian Campo-Flores", "Arian.Campo-Flores Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105100/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
