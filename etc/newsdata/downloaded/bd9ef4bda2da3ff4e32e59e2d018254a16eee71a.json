Yes, union ranks have been steadily diminished in recent decades, and unions have been subjected to a sustained and often successful campaign of demonization by employees, shadowy dark money groups, conservative ideologues and black-robed judicial cheerleaders for corporations. But as my colleague Sarah Jones has pointed out, labor is feeling its oats in 2020:\n\n[L]abor is seizing its moment. In a Wednesday morning speech in Milwaukee, the president of the Service Employees International Union outlined sweeping expectations for candidates who want the union\u2019s endorsement. Mary Kay Henry praised Democrats for releasing policy plans to raise taxes on corporations and the rich, but made it clear that those plans are an inadequate substitute for releasing detailed, union-specific proposals. \u201cThe wealthy will find a way to protect their wealth, often at any cost. That\u2019s why we need to put working people in charge. Because when workers organize, we can make bigger change, and we can make it stick,\u201d Henry told assembled workers.\n\nShe then called for remedies that would increase union power and raise the nation\u2019s rates of union membership. SEIU, she said, expects candidate proposals to meet four basic standards. They should prioritize union membership as a way to reduce economic inequality, and call for sectoral bargaining, where workers employed by different companies in the same industry could bargain collectively for a universal contract. They should also urge states to treat federal labor law as a floor, and not a ceiling, for labor rights, and ensure that federal workers and contractors make at least $15 an hour and have a chance to form a union if they choose. \u201cIf candidates can\u2019t commit to these four things, they can\u2019t count on our support,\u201d she said, \u201cand let\u2019s face it, these candidates need our support.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s probably no coincidence that fast-rising candidate Elizabeth Warren released her latest \u201cplan\u201d focused on labor rights the day before SEIU\u2019s pre-endorsement presidential forum. And Vox\u2019s Alexia Fernandez Campbell adjudges it as the \u201cmost ambitious\u201d of the campaign so far. It\u2019s certainly the longest, weighing in at 14 pages, and clearly meeting all of SEIU\u2019s criteria. Bernie Sanders anticipated Warren\u2019s action in August with his own \u201cWorkplace Democracy Plan.\u201d As Campbell says, though, Warren\u2019s is more detail-oriented:\n\nIn many ways, Warren\u2019s ideas mirror some of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s proposals, like making it easier for workers to go on strike and letting unions bargain on behalf of an entire industry. But Warren also focuses on the minutiae \u2014 the little tweaks and changes that could make a real difference for working Americans.\n\nAbout a month ago Campbell also characterized the leading candidates as a whole as falling into two groups:\n\nReading the labor platforms for each of the 10 candidates who qualified for the third Democratic primary debate next week, two groups emerged: the labor reformers and the labor supporters. Most of the frontrunners fall into the first category \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke, Buttigieg, and Sanders have all put out astonishingly detailed proposals that would shift the balance of power from businesses to workers. Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang are in the second group. They seem to see themselves more as allies to workers and labor unions than true change-makers.\n\nMore recently, veteran labor reporter Steven Greenhouse gave candidates letter grades for their labor proposals, with Sanders and Warren earning an A; Pete Buttigieg an A-minus; Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, and Beto O\u2019Rourke a B; Amy Klobuchar a B-minus; and Andrew Yang a C+. (To provide context, Greenhouse awarded Donald Trump an F-plus). It\u2019s interesting that in almost all assessments of the field, Warren rated well even before she issued her \u201cplan\u201d because of deep appreciation for her trade policy proposals, which some union officials told Greenhouse were \u201cby far the best and most sophisticated they\u2019ve ever seen from a lawmaker.\u201d She had also made a mark earlier with her Accountable Capitalism Act, guaranteeing workers 40 percent of corporate board positions, and her early support for California\u2019s new legislation restoring wage, benefit, and union rights to \u201cgig economy\u201d workers.\n\nWhatever endorsements individual unions make (and most are being cautious this year after too many piled onto the Hillary Clinton bandwagon early in the 2016 cycle), their memberships have a host of concerns just like any other voters, including health care (e.g., Medicare for All, which some fervently embrace while others fear as disruptive of generous health plans won at the bargaining table), specific industry concerns related to energy and the environment, women\u2019s and minority rights, and of course electability. Any of the Democrats would be considered far superior to Trump and the party he leads. It\u2019s notable that the pol most often singled out as representing the GOP\u2019s bright and diverse post-Trump future, Nikki Haley, once told corporate investors they weren\u2019t welcome in South Carolina if they brought along \u201cunion jobs.\u201d Now more than ever, presidential general elections are a holy war for the labor movement, and its organizational muscle and enthusiasm will be valued assets for the eventual Democratic nominee.", "description": "Already popular in union circles for her trade policy ideas, Elizabeth Warren has now followed Bernie Sanders in releasing a labor platform, even more detailed than his, just before SEIU holds a forum in a year when labor support could be critical.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/03/03-elizabeth-warren-uaw-strike.w1200.h630.jpg"}
