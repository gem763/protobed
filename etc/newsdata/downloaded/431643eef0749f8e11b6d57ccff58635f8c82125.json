The package - which has since been released - was aimed at supporting US interests in a friendly country.\n\nMr Trump, a Republican, denies any wrongdoing and has dismissed the impeachment proceedings as a \"hoax\" and \"another witch-hunt\".\n\nHe acknowledged that he had personally blocked nearly $400m (\u00a3324m) in military aid to Ukraine days before he spoke to Mr Zelensky, but denied that it was to pressure the Ukrainian leader into investigating Mr Biden.\n\nWho is the whistleblower and what was said?\n\nFew details are known. A lawyer for the whistleblower warned that trying to identify the person could place them \"in harm's way\".\n\nThe New York Times, Washington Post and Reuters news agency identified the whistleblower as a CIA officer.\n\nTheir complaint accuses Mr Trump of \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the US 2020 election\".\n\nThe declassified document characterises the president's conduct as a \"serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US citizens react to the latest developments\n\nThe whistleblower says they had learned from several sources that senior White House officials had intervened to \"lock down\" all records of the call, particularly an official word-for-word transcript.\n\n\"This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,\" the whistleblower wrote in the complaint.", "description": "The US secretary of state is ordered to turn over all related documents within a week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D12E/production/_109005535_cc1b89c2-23e0-4c53-9273-6e20cf0076d5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
