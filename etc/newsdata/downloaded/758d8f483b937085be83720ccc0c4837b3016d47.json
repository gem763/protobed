And yet when you finally lay your head down to rest for the day ahead, the curtains so often do a poor job of blocking the sunlight.\n\nEven the fanciest hotels sometimes have transparent blinds or gaps in their curtains which can make it difficult to rest.\n\nSo one savvy traveller has come up with his own hack (or rather regurgitated an old hack he saw) which ensures no rays get into the room.\n\nRick Klau, from California, managed to make \u2018blackout curtains\u2019 using only a clothes hanger.\n\nThe trick involves using a clip-on hanger normally used for skirts, dress and trousers. Rick simply pulled the two sides of the curtains together and sealed them with the hanger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe nifty method has impressed many a social media user as his tweet went viral, amassing almost 400,000 likes.\n\nI wrap my hotel pillow with a hotel towel. Cause I sleep on my stomach and the thought of breathing in previous hotel visitor's breath or dribble from the pillow frightens me to the core. \u2014 Terrii (@Terrii0206) October 4, 2019\n\nIn the post, he wrote: \u2018I don\u2019t remember who posted this on Twitter a few years ago, but whoever you are: you have improved every night I\u2019ve spent in a hotel since.\u2019\n\nPeople were delighted by the tip and said they\u2019d be trying it out next time they were staying at an establishment.\n\nOthers noted how annoying it is to be awakened by light: \u2018All those times I\u2019ve awakened to that unbelievably annoying \u201ccrack of light\u201d that pierces my brain and makes me want to throw things\u2026\u2019\n\nRick\u2019s video prompted other Twitter users to share their own travelling tips and advice.\n\nOne person replied: \u2018My hotel hack is if you ever need an extra phone charger, ask the front desk if they found one. They have a box full.\u2019\n\nSome even cooler hotel hacks you\u2019d find useful !
