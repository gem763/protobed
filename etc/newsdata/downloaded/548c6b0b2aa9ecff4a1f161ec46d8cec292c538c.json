Another 13 wedding party participants were injured.\n\nA senior Afghan Defence Ministry official said the raid was against \u201ca foreign terrorist group actively engaged in organizing terrorist attacks\u201d. He said government forces had also destroyed a large warehouse of militants\u2019 equipment.\n\nA second ministry official said a foreign militant detonated a suicide vest that killed him and others around him, including a woman, in response to the raid. \u201cWe are aware that civilians were injured in the attack,\u201d he said.\n\nColonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said they joined with Afghan security forces in the Helmand operation, conducting \u201cprecision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and U.S. forces.\u201d\n\nLeggett said most of those killed in the operation were struck by the gunfire of militants or from detonations of their explosives caches or suicide vests.\n\nRelatives of a wedding party victims sit outside the emergency hospital gate in Helmand, Afghanistan September 23, 2019, in this still image taken from a video.

Twenty-two Taliban fighters in all were killed and 14 captured, the defence ministry said. Five Pakistanis and a Bangladeshi national were among those captured.\n\nWAR PICKS UP AGAIN\n\nBombing, air strikes and ground clashes between U.S.-backed government forces and militants have flared anew since the U.S.-Taliban negotiations fell apart, and ahead of a presidential election next week.\n\nIn the drone strike on Sept. 18 in the eastern province of Nangarhar, local government officials said 32 pine nut harvesters were killed and 40 were injured.\n\nMalik Khyali, 62, a resident of Khogyani district in Nangarhar, said he lost a son in the strike and would not forgive those who carried it out as he knew of no militants hiding among farm labourers in the wooded area.\n\nKhyali said his son Madad Khan was employed as a cook who was serving meals to pine nut harvesters when a drone crashed into their tents. \u201cI saw body parts being collected in several sacks...If you had seen them covered with blood and dirt, you would not be able to eat for days,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nThe Taliban have been staging near-daily attacks since the collapse of peace talks in the run-up to the presidential election on Sept. 28 in order to discourage people from voting.\n\nLast week a suicide bombing outside a hospital in Qalat in southern Afghanistan killed 39 people and injured 140. The Taliban said the target was a nearby building housing the regional government\u2019s intelligence department.\n\nFarah Sami, a mother of four whose three-year-old son was critically wounded in that attack, said combatants were engaged in mindless violence to justify their existence.\n\n\u201cAll sides have been killing civilians. There is no hero or villain in this long war,\u201d she said.\n\nThe United States in 2001 sent forces to Afghanistan to oust Taliban leaders after they refused to hand over members of the al Qaeda militant group behind the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n\nRelatives of a wedding party victims wait outside the emergency hospital in Helmand, Afghanistan September 23, 2019, in this still image taken from a video. Reuters TV via REUTERS\n\nSince then, U.S. forces have backed Afghan troops in war against the al Qaeda, Taliban and Islamic State groups that recruit Afghans and foreigners who mount attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and foreign forces.\n\nA U.N. report released on June 30 said 717 civilian deaths were attributed to American and Afghan forces during the first six months of the year, compared with 531 blamed on militants.\n\nLast week President Ashraf Ghani promised measures to reduce civilian casualties. On Monday he tweeted a call for \u201cextra caution\u201d in military operations, and ordered investigations.", "description": "At least 40 civilians attending a wedding party were killed by explosions and gunfire during a raid by U.S.-backed Afghan government forces on a nearby Islamist militant hideout, officials in Helmand province said on Monday.", "authors": ["Mohammed Stanekzai", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433018468&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1JO", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
