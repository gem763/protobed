Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\n\u2026.People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nThe admiral, well-respected for his role in overseeing the operation to kill Al Qaeda terrorist Osama bin Laden in 2011, argues that senior military leaders have lost confidence in the president and feel he is a threat to the nation.\n\n\u201cAs I stood on the parade field at Fort Bragg,\u201d McRaven recalled, \u201cone retired four-star general, grabbed my arm, shook me and shouted, \u2018I don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!\u2019\u201d\n\nMcRaven does not argue that President Trump has done anything wrong in particular, but that he has no respect for America\u2019s values. These values, McRaven declares, involve a commitment to \u201chelp the weak and stand up against oppression and injustice\u201d around the world.\n\n\u201c[W]hat will happen to the Kurds, the Iraqis, the Afghans, the Syrians, the Rohingyas, the South Sudanese and the millions of people under the boot of tyranny or left abandoned by their failing states?\u201d McRaven asks, without explicitly calling for military intervention in any of the regions mentioned.\n\nHis criticism goes beyond that voiced in a Washington Post op-ed last year, in which he merely promised \u201ccriticism\u201d of the president in the wake of the removal of former CIA director John Brennan\u2019s security clearance.\n\nThe admiral is unwilling to wait for the 2020 presidential election to see a change of power. He declares (emphasis added): \u201c[I]t is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2014 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2014 the sooner, the better. The fate of our Republic depends upon it.\u201d\n\nMoreover, McRaven makes no reference to voting, or elections \u2014 or even impeachment.\n\nArticle 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice bars \u201ccontemptuous words against the President,\u201d and applies to retired members of the armed forces entitled to pay.\n\nRead McRaven\u2019s full op-ed here.\n\nJoel B.
