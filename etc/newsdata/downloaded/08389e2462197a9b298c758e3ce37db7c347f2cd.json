At the time, the young teen (now age 40) had been offered a flat $2 million dollars for his work on the 1994 film. It was a huge step up from the $80k he\u2019d received from his previous role as Michael Jackson in TV mini-series The Jacksons: An American Dream. In an interview with Vlad TV, the actor and singer explained why he decided to initially decline such a hefty sum.\n\nWeaver shared that his agent called him and his family up to give them the news that Disney was offering $2 million dollars, but it came with a caveat: he would get nothing in royalties.\n\n\u201cThat amount of money, to an average middle class family in Chicago in the early 90s, I mean ... that\u2019s something. But immediately, my mom goes, \u2018Wait a minute\u2026,\u201d shared Weaver.\n\nWhile the sum would\u2019ve been immediately life-changing, Weaver\u2019s mother was thinking in terms of the long game for her son, like when he turned 40.\n\n\"Disney had a reputation for re-releasing stuff,\" Weaver says, adding that his mother fully comprehended this. Lady in the Tramp and Bambi, for example, were both re-released in the 80s, with Snow White re-released in the US in 1993, and Sleeping Beauty re-released two years later. And with each re-release, those with royalties in their contracts would receive a nice, hefty check,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey were releasing that [stuff from the old catalog] when they were releasing new Disney stuff, so she was able to see the playing field and go, \u2018Wait a minute, this is going to make a lot of money over time.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Weaver\u2019s mother understood that Disney wasn\u2019t exactly hurting for money.\n\n\u201cShe was like, \u2018Nah, let\u2019s negotiate royalties,\u2019\u201d Weaver says of his forward-thinking mother\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cYou gotta remember, they\u2019re coming off of Beauty and the Beast, you know what I\u2019m saying? They\u2019re coming off of Aladdin. Disney had bread,\u201d says Weaver. To put things in further perspective, Beauty and the Beast grossed $425 million dollars. As for Aladdin, the 1992 film raked in $504 million in the box office. Disney did, indeed, have bread. And while the $2 million was tempting, it was just a drop in the bucket of what the Walt Disney Company could afford.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think they knew, in forecast, that they were gonna make a shit ton of money.\u201d Indeed, 1994\u2019s The Lion King grossed $968.5 million in the box office \u2014 more than four times the earnings of The Little Mermaid.\n\nOver the years, Disney has found numerous ways to make more money off The Lion King Franchise.\n\n\u201cThey got the Animal Kingdom in Disney World that\u2019s themed off The Lion King. They got dolls and T-shirts and video games. I mean I got a platinum plaque for a story book that they released that was really just a storybook with my song in it,\u201d said Weaver.\n\nEventually, Disney offered Weaver a $100,000 check that would include royalties in perpetuity.\n\nTo some it might seem like the wrong move, but Weaver fully recognizes and appreciates the decision his mother made on his behalf.\n\n\u201cWhen I got my first royalty check, me and my mom thought it was a mistake,\u201d Weaver admitted of the hefty amount he eventually received.\n\nA quarter of a century later, Weaver has made back well above the $1.9 million dollars he initially turned down due to the royalty checks, and he\u2019s thankful.\n\n\u201cShout out to my mother...She was absolutely right. That residual income that I generate, that is so helpful,\u201d said the actor, whose other acting credits include The Lebrons TV series, ATL and The Ladykillers.\n\nIt just goes to show, sometimes it is best to play the long game, especially when dealing with powerhouses like Disney.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
