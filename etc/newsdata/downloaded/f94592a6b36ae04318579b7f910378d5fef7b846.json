We remain open to any scenario; so staying here, or going elsewhere. We are discussing it to find the best solution for both parties.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nUnited are desperate to add more firepower going forward to their ranks in January following the sale of last season's top scorer Romelu Lukaku to Inter in August.\n\nSo far this season United's top scorer is Marcus Rashford with five goals, with Anthony Martial close behind with four.", "description": "The veteran striker has been linked with a January move to Old Trafford but the Croatian is also wanted by a number of other sides", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20552053.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Genoa-Cfc-vs-Juventus-Fc-Italy-17-Mar-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
