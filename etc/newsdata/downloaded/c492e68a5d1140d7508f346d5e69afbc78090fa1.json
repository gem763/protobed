That this deal contains a option to purchase permanently suggests that prediction was a little wide of the mark.\n\nIt has been a peripatetic existence over recent seasons for Baker, shifted from loan to loan without a true sense of purpose or progress underpinning each move.\n\nThe midfielder made his debut for the Stamford Bridge club at Derby in FA Cup January 2014\n\nThe Luton-born star is now on his seventh spell away from Chelsea as he eyes more minutes\n\nSix inauspicious appearances for a club lingering fourth from bottom in the Bundesliga will not be enough to catch Frank Lampard's eye, but there is time - precious little of it - for Baker to find form and, with it, a permanent home.\n\nFortuna Dusseldorf are now his seventh temporary spell away from Stamford Bridge since that fateful declaration and, at 24 going on 25, time is slipping away to fulfill that early promise.\n\nBaker was seemingly brought in as a replacement for the long-term injured Kevin Stoger, Fortuna's 'marathon man' in central midfield.\n\nHe has a big task to fulfill, replacing a key player who fans credit as a factor in keeping the club well clear of the relegation places last season.\n\nFormer England Under-21 team-mate Tammy Abraham (right) is now in Chelsea's first-team\n\nBaker started the season well as Fortuna beat Werder Bremen 3-1 in the first game of the season, but had a torrid time against Bayer Leverkusen on Matchday Two, scoring an own goal after six minutes and generally struggling in that game.\n\nChris Wilkins, of UK Fortuna, told Sportsmail: 'With Stoger due back from injury in November it remains to be seen if Baker will keep his place in the starting XI, though I feel that his performances will improve in parallel with the team's performances.'\n\nWhile he has yet to score, Baker has gone on record to claim he is settling in well, with the likes of keeper Zack Steffen and USA star Alfredo Morales ensuring the club has plenty of English speakers.\n\nThe time may have come to consign Mourinho's claim as incorrect, but Baker will be determined to ensure his career has plenty more chapters to write.\n\nThe 24-year-old has declared himself happy at Fortuna Dusseldorf and he has settled well\n\nRabbi Matondo (Schalke)\n\nThe Liverpool-born Welsh flyer has been eased into the first-team after forcing through an \u00a311million move from Manchester City in January.\n\nHe made three fleeting appearances last season but this campaign, under new boss David Wagner, he has been hampered by a knee issue before scoring his first Bundesliga goal on his first appearance against RB Leipzig.\n\nAs the latest jet-heeled youngster to leave Manchester City's academy in search of senior action, things are going as well as they could be.\n\nThere was a minor hiccup when he was thrown off a flight home from Wales' Portugal training camp in July for 'disruptive behaviour' but he will join up with Ryan Giggs' squad this week, once again hoping to make an impact.\n\nYoung attacker Rabbi Matondo is beginning to make a positive impression with Schalke\n\nJonjoe Kenny (Schalke, on loan from Everton)\n\nOpting for a season in the Bundesliga over acting as Seamus Coleman's back-up so far appears to be the right move for Everton starlet Jonjoe Kenny.\n\nHe has not missed a minute so far, helping David Wagner's side rise up to fourth spot in the league.\n\nHe scored a sensational goal in the win over Hertha and is becoming an increasingly important part of Wagner's defence, winning the Young Player of the Month award in August.\n\nA loan move to Schalke has reinvigorated the career of young Everton right-back Jonjoe Kenny\n\nEthan Ampadu (RB Leipzig, on loan from Chelsea)\n\nA rare example of a starlet allowed out on loan by Lampard, having been closely guarded by previous bosses Antonio Conte and Maurizio Sarri.\n\nWith Fikayo Tomori, Andreas Christensen, Kurt Zouma and Antonio Rudiger all vying for a centre back slot, the hope was that Ethan Ampadu could thrive playing week-in, week-out for a young, electric RB Leipzig side.\n\nSo far, that has not quite happened. The 19-year-old has watched from the bench as Dayot Upamecano and more senior figures are preferred, the Welshman yet to play a minute.\n\nHe does, however, retain the faith of Ryan Giggs and is likely to feature in Wales' Euro 2020 qualifiers.\n\nEthan Ampadu has yet to make a mark for RB leipzig during his season loan spell from Chelsea\n\nAdemola Lookman (RB Leipzig)\n\nOverlooked at Everton for a variety of reasons, a \u00a322.5m move to Germany in the summer \u2013 having enjoyed a wildly successful loan at Leipzig in 2018 \u2013 appeared the ideal move to revitalise Ademola Lookman.\n\nTwo league appearances totalling 41 minutes suggest it has been a slow start for the winger, but with a plethora of talent available it is no surprise that Lookman must bide his time.\n\nRB Leipzig paid out a substantial sum to be reunited with young winger Ademola Lookman\n\nReece Oxford (Augsburg)\n\nHaving broken into West Ham's first team at the age of just 16, a bright future seemed inevitable.\n\nFour years and just 17 senior appearances later, ties were finally broken with east London and a new adventure started in Augsburg.\n\nHe has been a regular figure in Germany, playing eight games so far, but his new side have just one league win so far and hover perilously above the relegation zone.\n\nThere have been signs of life and the hope is, with regular football, a chance will come for the defender-cum-midfielder to move back up the rungs in time.\n\nReece Oxford burst on the scene for West Ham at the age of just 16 but has struggled since\n\nJadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund)\n\nThe jewel in the crown for Borussia Dortmund, Jadon Sancho has reached new heights over the past few seasons.\n\nAlready an important England player at just 19, Sancho has three goals and six assists for the title chasers after seven league games.\n\nThere are, though, a few warning signs. Dortmund boss Lucien Favre dropped Sancho recently after admitting the winger was left 'empty' by a hectic schedule.", "description": "Sparked in part by the runaway success of Jadon Sancho at Borussia Dortmund, recent seasons have seen increasing numbers of young British players make the move to the Bundesliga.", "authors": ["James Ayles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19659642-0-image-a-18_1570982238922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
