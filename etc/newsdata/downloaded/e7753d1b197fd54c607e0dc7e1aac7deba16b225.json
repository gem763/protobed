I\u2019ve always done my best to serve where I felt I could make the most impact,\u201d Gabbard said in a video. \u201cIt\u2019s this principle of service above self that has motivated the decisions I\u2019ve made throughout my life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nI'm so grateful to the people of Hawai\u02bbi for allowing me to serve you in Congress for the last 7 years.

In 2013, she became the first Hindu woman in Congress.\n\nAD\n\nShe has staked out an idiosyncratic position in the Democratic Party, criticizing military intervention overseas and embracing left-leaning domestic policy.\n\nGabbard has also drawn harsh rebukes for traveling to Syria in 2017 to meet with Bashar al-Assad and for advocating against arming and assisting the rebels battling al-Assad\u2019s regime.\n\nLast week, Hillary Clinton suggested that Russia might promote Gabbard as a third-party candidate to sow chaos in the 2020 presidential election. Gabbard has denied considering a third-party bid, and multiple Democratic presidential contenders defended her from Clinton\u2019s claims.\n\nAD\n\nHours before announcing that she would not seek another term in Congress, Gabbard appeared on Fox News host Sean Hannity\u2019s show Thursday night to criticize Democrats for holding impeachment hearings in private.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat inquiry needs to be done in a very narrowly focused way and it must be done transparently. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in those closed doors,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that the American people deserve to know exactly what the facts are, what the evidence is that\u2019s being presented as this inquiry goes on.\u201d\n\nIn Hawaii, her primary challenger has steadily hammered her over the time she\u2019s spent campaigning for president.\n\n\u201cAppearing on national television the night before is not an excuse to miss work,\u201d Kahele told the Honolulu Star Advertiser on Oct. 16 after Gabbard missed a vote on a House resolution condemning Trump for pulling American troops from northern Syria. \u201cThe people of Hawaii deserve a representative who is committed full-time to this job.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, Kahele praised Gabbard\u2019s decision to drop out of the race.\n\nI wholly respect and appreciate Congresswoman Gabbard\u2019s decision not to pursue re-election for her Congressional seat as she pursues the Presidency. I wish her and her family the best going forward.\n\n\n\nI remain fully committed to my campaign to becomes Hawaii\u2019s next Congressman. \u2014 Kai Kahele (@kaikahele) October 25, 2019\n\nAD", "description": "Tulsi Gabbard cited her presidential bid in her decision not to seek another term on Capitol Hill.", "authors": ["Tim Elfrink", "Editor Of The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HuZLJmgQAEYFI46RhFefI0ou3bg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KFSLPTF3OQI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
