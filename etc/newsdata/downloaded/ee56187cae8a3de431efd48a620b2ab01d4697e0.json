Because if fans are more locked in to their specific players, it\u2019s only going to boost the league. At the end of the day, fan engagement is at a premium and this is something that enhances everything in our ecosystem.\"\n\nDinwiddie is coming off a solid season with the Nets where he averaged 16.8 points per game and 4.6 assists. His appearances came mainly off the bench as he made just four starts last year in 68 games.\n\nThe idea dreamed up by Dinwiddie and his partner, DREAM Fan Shares, \"leverages guaranteed contracts and the potential for performance-based bonuses and other contingent bonuses to structure debt securities represented by PAInTs, giving accredited investors the opportunity to invest in securities tied to the financial success of athletes, artists and influencers.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe minimum to get in the door is $150,000, with a minimum offering from Dinwiddie of 33 tokens guaranteed at $4.95 million.
