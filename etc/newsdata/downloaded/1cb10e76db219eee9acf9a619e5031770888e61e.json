Ministers insisted on Sunday that it now has the backing of the 320 members of Parliament needed to win.\n\n\u201cWe appear to have the numbers to get this through,\u201d Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC TV\u2019s \u201cAndrew Marr Show.\u201d\n\nThat optimism was shared by Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit preparations, who said the risk of a no-deal Brexit had increased because there was no guarantee the EU would grant Britain\u2019s request for an extension.\n\nThe government confirmed on Sunday it was triggering Operation Yellowhammer, its contingency plan to make sure Britain can deal with the fallout from a chaotic departure from the EU.\n\nGrudging\n\nJohnson made clear to the EU that he\u2019d rather Britain leave without delay and he refused to sign the letter requesting an extension, one of three sent to Brussels late Saturday. European Council President Donald Tusk is now consulting member states on how to respond.\n\nThe Times of London on Sunday, citing unnamed diplomatic sources, said the EU is ready to grant a three-month extension if Parliament fails to approve the deal, with the U.K. able to leave on the 1st or 15th of November, December or January if an accord is ratified. If Johnson calls a second referendum, or meets other obstacles, governments led by Germany would push for a longer extension, possibly pushing the deadline to June 2020, the Times said.\n\nJohnson received a boost when former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who walked out of the government and the Tory party in protest at the expulsion of 21 colleagues, said she and many among those who were kicked out are ready to support his deal.\n\nThe prime minister also has the backing of a small number of Labour MPs, though he may struggle to win over many more. Crucially, Labour wants a customs union with the EU and for any deal to be put to another referendum with an option to stay in the bloc, demands on which there appears little room for compromise.\n\nThe main opposition party was last night accused of trying to obstruct Brexit after Keir Starmer, its Brexit spokesman, said Labour would back amendments on a second referendum and a customs union.\n\nThough it is doubtful that either proposal could command a majority in the Commons, Starmer made a direct appeal to the Conservatives\u2019 former allies in the Democratic Unionist Party, who might be persuaded to rethink their previous opposition to a customs union due to concerns that Johnson\u2019s deal puts up trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s 10 votes on Saturday made the difference between defeat and victory, and there are no signs they are softening. The party has deep reservations about anything that creates any kind of border between Britain and Northern Ireland, such as customs checks in the Irish Sea, and wants a stronger consent mechanism that hands a greater say to the regional assembly.", "description": "Johnson Revives Push to Get Brexit Deal Passed as Optimism Grows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic490bda8090d44a7f2118e2f950f16b70.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
