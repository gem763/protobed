Saving money on medical care is a lot tougher than saving money on food, however. Two big culprits: opaque pricing and ever-changing insurance company rules about what\u2019s covered and what\u2019s not.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFor help in cutting costs, I turned to a uniquely qualified individual: Carolyn McClanahan, an emergency room doctor turned certified financial planner. McClanahan, director of financial planning at Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida, frequently speaks at industry conferences, teaching other advisors how to help their clients best navigate the health care system.\n\nThese are the three questions she suggests everyone ask:\n\nHow do I use health care?\n\nMcClanahan divides people into low, medium and high health care users. Low users are generally in good health and rarely go to the doctor. High users tend to have chronic health conditions or young children and visit the doctor several times a year. Both can be good fits for high-deductible health care insurance, McClanahan says.\n\nPeople who spend a lot on health care will quickly meet a high deductible and often end up spending less overall on high-deductible plans, which have lower premiums.\n\nConversely, people who use very little health care may also spend less on a low-premium, high-deductible plan. It\u2019s people in the middle \u2014 who do visit the doctor, but likely won\u2019t spend enough to meet a high deductible \u2014 who should consider lower-deductible plans, she says.\n\nOne caveat: People who have a high-deductible plan should have enough savings to cover that deductible. The downside of such plans is that they may discourage people from seeking the care they need. Earmarking cash to cover the deductible can help thwart that tendency. If that\u2019s not possible, a low-deductible plan may be better for someone\u2019s health.\n\nAlso, routine services that can detect or prevent illness \u2014 such as vaccinations and certain cancer screenings \u2014 are free in many health insurance plans, regardless of the deductible.\n\nAre you covered in my network?\n\nThis is a much better question to ask a provider than \u201cDo you take my insurance?\u201d An out-of-network provider may be willing to bill your insurer but can wind up costing you much more than an in-network provider. Also, insurance companies offer many different plans, and doctors that are in an insurer\u2019s preferred provider organization may not be in its high-deductible health plan network.\n\nPeople should ask, \u201cIs this in network?\u201d for every aspect of their health care, from the laboratory that tests their blood to the anesthesiologist who\u2019s scheduled for their surgery. Keep a written record of whom you talked to and when, McClanahan recommends. This can give you ammunition to get bills covered or discounted if the information you were given is wrong.\n\nFor prescription medications, ask your insurer, \u201cHow is this covered?\u201d Insurers have formularies with different co-pays for different drugs, and some may not be covered. Patients can ask their pharmacists if there is a less expensive version available, such as a generic.\n\nFor some drugs, paying cash is cheaper than an insurance company\u2019s co-pay. A 30-day supply of metformin, a drug to treat high blood sugar, may have a $10 co-pay but be available for $4 cash at Walmart and other outlets.\n\nYou also can look for coupons and other discounts at GoodRx.com. Another way to save: Regularly ask your doctor to review the medications you\u2019re taking to see if you can stop or swap any for a less expensive version.\n\n\u201cDoctors are too quick to throw a pill at you,\u201d McClanahan says. \u201cAsk, ask, ask, and shop around.\u201d\n\nWhat else can I do?\n\nSometimes, medications or surgery are less effective than alternative treatments. Treating lower back pain with exercise, cognitive behavior therapy and focused breathing is more effective than the treatments doctors usually prescribe, including rest, surgery and injections, according to articles in the British medical journal The Lancet in March.\n\nDoctors may not suggest lifestyle changes because they believe most patients won\u2019t make the effort, McClanahan says. But losing weight, exercising and quitting tobacco can lessen symptoms or prevent many diseases. Those with prediabetes, for example, can often avoid developing Type 2 diabetes with changes in diet and exercise.\n\n\u201cIf the doctors aren\u2019t able to provide that education, ask if they will refer you to someone who will, a nutritionist or physical therapist,\u201d she says.\n\nNot all doctors welcome empowered patients who ask questions, McClanahan notes. If yours doesn\u2019t, she recommends finding one who is more collaborative.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cDoctors are not gods.
