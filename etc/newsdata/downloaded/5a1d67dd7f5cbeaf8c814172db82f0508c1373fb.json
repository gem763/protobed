Highlights will also be shown on Sky Sports Football on Sunday at 10:15pm.\n\nTeam news\n\nLow has called up a youthful side in an attempt to rejuvenate an ageing squad. Marc-Andre ter Stegen will start in goal ahead of veteran Manuel Neuer and an in-form Serge Gnabry is likely to feature alongside RB Leipzig\u2019s marksman Timo Werner in attack.\n\nJoshua Kimmich is expected to transfer his start to the season as a central midfielder at Bayern Munich to the Die Mannschaft to allow Lukas Klostermann to fill in at right-back.\n\nArgentina will be missing key players, after Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Angel di Maria, and Gonzalo Higuain were not named in the squad to face Ecuador and Germany.\n\nTheir absence has granted Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez another chance to shine after he netted a hat-trick against Mexico last time out. Manchester United\u2019s Marcos Rojo and Tottenham\u2019s Eric Lamela also earned re-calls to the national side.\n\nPredicted line-ups:\n\nGermany XI:\n\nTer Stegen, Klostermann, Sule, Ginter, Hector, Kroos, Kimmich, Reus, Havertz, Gnabry, Werner.\n\nArgentina XI:\n\nMarchesin, Saravia, Otamendi, Rojo, Tagliafico, Paredes, Pereyra, Correa, Lamela, Dybala, Martinez.\n\nOdds\n\nGermany to win: 10/13\n\nArgentina to win: 3/1\n\nDraw: 3/1\n\n(Odds supplied by 888 sport)\n\nPrediction\n\nGiven Germany\u2019s recent form, Argentina will feel as if it is a winnable game. However, being the home side, Joachim Low\u2019s men should win comfortably against a depleted Argentinian side. Serge Gnabry and Kai Havertz are the Bundesliga\u2019s in-form players at the moment and both will be looking to replicate their form to cement their place in the German national team.
