According to the report they traveled to Ukraine the day after the critical Trump-Zelenskiy call to meet the Ukrainian president.\n\nRelated: Trump-Ukraine whistleblower complaint: read it in full\n\nThe whistleblower report said that the two diplomats had \u201cprovided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of Mr Zelenskiy\u201d.\n\nThe report also said they also gave advice on how to \u201cunderstand and respond to the differing messages they were receiving from official US channels on the one hand, and from Mr Giuliani on the other\u201d.\n\nState department officials have confirmed that Volker helped Zelenskiy\u2019s office get in touch with Giuliani.\n\nQuestioned about the involvement of state department officials in connecting the Kyiv government with Giuliani, Pompeo sought to play down the importance of the whistleblower report.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to actually read the whistleblower complaint yet. I read the first couple of paragraphs, but I got busy today,\u201d Pompeo told reporters in New York where he is attending the UN general asssembly.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll ultimately get a chance to see it. If I understand it right it was someone who has secondhand knowledge,\u201d the secretary of state said.\n\n\u201cBut what I\u2019ll say this morning about the engagement of the state department is: to the best of my knowledge, and from what I\u2019ve seen so far, each of the actions that were undertaken by state department officials is entirely appropriate and consistent with the objective that we had.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cCertainly, since we have come into office, we\u2019re trying to use this opportunity to create a better relationship between the United States and Ukraine, to build on opportunities to tighten our relationship and to help end corruption in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Menendez, said Pompeo\u2019s responses had been inadequate and called for him to appear before the committee.\n\nMenendez said in a tweet that the whistleblower report \u201cshows senior state department officials were both on the line AND briefed after Trump\u2019s call pressuring Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\n\u201c[Secretary Pompeo] must appear before the Senate foreign relations committee immediately to explain his agency\u2019s role in this mess.\u201d\n\nPompeo cut short questions at his press conference and was not asked about his own role in adding credence to Trump\u2019s allegations about the Biden family and cutting short the posting of the former US ambassador to Kyiv Marie Yovanovitch in May after she was attacked by rightwing media for being anti-Trump.\n\nIn his July call to Zelenskiy, Trump referred to her disparagingly as \u201cthe woman\u201d, calling her \u201cbad news\u201d, and adding, darkly and mysteriously: \"she\u2019s going to go through some things\u201d.\n\n\u201cYovanovitch was slimed,\u201d said Daniel Fried, former secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. \u201cThe way she was treated was disgraceful. I have known her for 25 years and she is careful, scrupulous, and professional. She is someone who does not freelance. She is a straight arrow.\u201d\n\nFried, now at the Atlantic Council, said that aides to the former president Petro Poroshenko had denounced Yovanovitch to their allies in the conservative US press, because she had been highly critical of the failure to prosecute corruption aggressively.\n\nA former official familiar with the sequence of events said Zelenskiy\u2019s office began trying to organise a summit meeting with Trump soon after his election in April. With the help of the US embassy, a tentative plan was put together for the two leaders to meet at a conference on Ukrainian reform in July.\n\nThe White House pulled out of that event and suggested a White House meeting in late July. That date was then postponed. Meanwhile Giuliani approached the US embassy in Kyiv asking for ways of connecting to Zelenskiy\u2019s inner circle but he was rebuffed by Yovanovitch.", "description": "Secretary of state insists officials behaved appropriately over allegations they connected the Kyiv government with GiulianiUS secretary of State Mike Pompeo takes questions during a press conference at the UN general assembly in New York on Thursday.
