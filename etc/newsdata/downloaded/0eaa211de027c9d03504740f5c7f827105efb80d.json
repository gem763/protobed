Bolton was President Trump\u2019s national security adviser from April 2018 until last month, when he unceremoniously left the White House.\n\nDuring his time there, events unfolded that precipitated Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, worked to shape Trump\u2019s relationship with Volodymyr Zelensky, who became president of Ukraine in May 2019.\n\nGiuliani had been trying to investigate the Biden family\u2019s activity in Ukraine. While then-Vice President Joe Biden led the Obama administration\u2019s Ukraine policy, his son Hunter was on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma.\n\nThe Bidens maintain Hunter Biden didn\u2019t use his father\u2019s position to enrich his company. Giuliani has argued the situation was immensely corrupt.\n\nThanks to his encouragement, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Burisma on a now notorious July 25 phone call. At the same time, the Trump administration held up an aid package it had promised to deliver to the Ukrainians.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s efforts made Bolton deeply uncomfortable, according to multiple reports about congressional testimony from Fiona Hill, who worked under him at the National Security Council. Bolton reportedly compared Giuliani\u2019s activity to a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s characterization of Bolton\u2019s views captured the attention of House Democrats, who now want to hear from the man himself. If Bolton testifies, he will be the most senior administration official to share information with the inquiry seeking to oust his former boss.", "description": "The former national security was reportedly deeply uncomfortable with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine efforts.
