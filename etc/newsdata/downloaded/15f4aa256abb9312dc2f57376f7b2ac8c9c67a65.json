She's 74, and in Catherine The Great (Sky Atlantic) she plays the Russian monarch in her early 40s as a woman of supreme power who is sexually irresistible to all her courtiers.\n\nAnd she gets away with it. The last major female film star to attempt such a feat was probably Mae West, who was 85 when she played a silver screen sex-bomb embarking on her sixth marriage in the catastrophic 1978 musical Sextette.\n\nFighting off the attentions of an entire athletics squad, every one besotted with her, Mae declares: 'I'm the girl who works for Paramount all day and Fox all night!'\n\nCatherine The Great is an attempt to splice the historical grandeur of The Crown with the sex and violence of Game Of Thrones. It achieves that, with sumptuous sets and costumes, and a galloping pace of palace rumpy-pumpy that would tax a warren full of rabbits on Viagra.\n\nHelen Mirren shines as Catherine the Great in the Sky Atlantic show\n\nSince few of us know much of this 18th-century megalomaniac, there's a lot of explaining to be done \u2014 and most of it happens while one character is bouncing up and down on another. Gina McKee and Jason Clarke, as the Countess Praskovya and Lieutenant Potemkin, were rolling around so much they must have felt seasick after most of their scenes.\n\nRory Kinnear is magnificent as a cunning adviser, like No 10 aide Dominic Cummings in a powdered wig, plotting the murder of a pretender to the throne. It's worth watching for the final scene alone, a mega-budget ball where all the guests are cross-dressing \u2014 Mirren in breeches and a false moustache, Kinnear in a big-busted gown with his boobs slipping.\n\nYou'll need a fairly strong stomach for the bloodshed. Kevin McNally and Richard Roxburgh, as the beastly brothers Orlov, mete out such a beating to Potemkin with boots and billiard cues that you can feel the bones crunch.\n\nThen they throw him out of a third-floor window, apparently breaking his back. That doesn't stop Potemkin from dancing like a Cossack at the ball five minutes later. They grew up tough in imperial St Petersburg.\n\nThe frustration is that you'll have to fork out extra if you want to watch. Catherine The Great airs on Sky Atlantic, which will also be available with a NowTV online subscription at \u00a38.99 a month from next week.\n\nToughest job of the week: A few months ago, The Best Little Prison In Britain? made jail look like Butlin's. But Inside Prison: Britain Behind Bars (ITV) paints a different picture. It leaves me with renewed respect for the officers battling to keep order.\n\nAnd if you want to enjoy the full spectacle, and wallow in the way every shot is composed almost entirely of rich greens, reds and golds, you'll benefit from a TV the size of a cinema screen.\n\nWatching telly is getting to be such an expensive business that it sometimes feels like the only people who can afford every channel must be armed robbers and drug-dealers.\n\nAnd they've got problems of their own, as The Met: Policing London (BBC1) revealed.\n\nIf it's not 20 shock-troops from the Territorial Support Group in full body armour, smashing down your front door in a dawn raid, it's the relentless old-school coppers on a stake-out outside your flat for days on end.\n\nDetective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan of Croydon CID was intent on nicking a persistent burglar who had turned violent \u2014 waving a gun in the face of former football club owner Simon Jordan as he snatched his \u00a3130,000 diamond-studded wristwatch.\n\nThe result of the investigation was never in much doubt. Dan got his man and the gun. Jewels and bundles of cash, the loot from numerous robberies, were stashed all over the apartment. It was very satisfying, and very Sweeney.", "description": "CHRISTOPHER STEVENS: You can't fault Helen Mirren for chutzpah.
