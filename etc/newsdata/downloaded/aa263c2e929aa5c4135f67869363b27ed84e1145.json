The American people shouldn\u2019t let them.\n\nThe idea of court-packing isn\u2019t a new one.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt famously promoted a bill to increase the number of Supreme Court justices as revenge for the court striking down unconstitutional pieces of the New Deal. At the time, of course, the public and Congress rejected such a blatant power grab.\n\nIn the decades since, activist judges have ruled the court and progressives have rarely complained.\n\n\n\nBut now, for the first time in decades, the Supreme Court has a majority that respects the Constitution\u2019s intent and believes in upholding the rule of law.\n\nJustices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have brought common sense back to the court, consistently writing sound decisions that respect the law. They are also both paragons of judicial independence, siding with the liberal wing of the court numerous times on issues of civil liberties, antitrust law and other contentious issues.\n\nBut the left can\u2019t stand them.\n\nInstead of acknowledging the legitimacy of Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, who were nominated by a fairly elected president and confirmed by a majority of senators, progressives howl about the \u201cminority rule\u201d of unelected judges and openly call for court-packing.\n\nSince 2016, progressives have revealed their true goals. They\u2019re not even giving lip service to the idea of an independent judiciary or the traditions of American government.\n\nIn recent months, columnists, pundits, and even presidential candidates have openly called for Democrats to court-pack. In Bouie\u2019s piece, for example, he argues for a broad reading of the Constitution to \u201cgive our elected officials the necessary power to act.\u201d He also worries that a \u201cfuture Democratic agenda would be circumscribed and unraveled.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what this argument is really about: Progressives believe the court\u2019s job is to give the government more power and ensure that a liberal agenda succeeds. They are no longer hiding their desire to win at all costs \u2014 they\u2019re printing it in the pages of The New York Times.\n\nPacking the court would have disastrous consequences for both the judicial system and our democracy. It would make the court a political football that changes with the whims of the presidency and party in power. It would also make every presidential election a life-or-death contest.\n\nAmerica\u2019s social fabric can\u2019t survive a vote on who has the right to reshape the Supreme Court, nor should it have to.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThankfully, the American people don\u2019t support radical tactics like this. According to a Gallup poll conducted earlier this month, a majority of Americans approve of the Supreme Court\u2019s job performance, while a plurality of Americans have viewed the political balance of the court as \u201cabout right\u201d since 1991.\n\nIn contrast, Heritage Action for America\u2019s recent polling shows that 57 percent of likely voters believe that national Democrats are becoming \u201cincreasingly extreme,\u201d including 30 percent of Democratic respondents.\n\nAmericans trust the court \u2014 they don\u2019t trust the left.\n\nInstead of packing the Supreme Court every time the White House switches hands, Congress should permanently fix the number of seats at nine. Earlier this year, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., proposed a constitutional amendment to do just that. An amendment would ensure every judge on the bench is independent and safe from political influence \u2014 a foreign concept for many of today\u2019s progressives.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSince 2016, progressives have revealed their true goals.
