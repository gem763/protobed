The standard offer is for 75,000 points after you spend $3,000 in the first three months.\n\nYou can redeem points from the welcome bonus at 7,000+ participating hotels around the world, 200+ global airlines and car suppliers, by purchasing Marriott Bonvoy Moments, or by purchasing gift cards from over 30 participating companies.\n\nAs a general rule, redeeming your Marriott points for stays at hotels or transferring your points to Marriott's partner airlines will give you the most value for your points.\n\nPoints earning on the Marriott Bonvoy Business Amex\n\nThere are a number of ways to earn points on daily purchases with the Marriott Bonvoy Business card, especially for patrons of Marriott hotels. Here's a breakdown of how you can earn points depending on the category of your purchases:\n\n6 points \u2014 for every dollar you spend on purchases at participating Marriott Bonvoy hotels\n\n4 points \u2014 for every dollar spent on select categories including US restaurants, US gas stations, US service providers for wireless telephone services, and US shipping purchases\n\n2 points \u2014 for all other eligible purchases\n\nUsing Marriott Bonvoy points\n\nThe simplest way to redeem your points is for free nights at Marriott's worldwide network of 7,000+ hotels and resorts. The tiered system allows you to book lower-end hotels for much less than luxury resorts.\n\nYou can also stretch your points even further by booking four nights in a row, as Marriott will give you the fifth free.\n\nWith Marriott's award chart, hotel night awards start at 5,000 points for Category 1 properties during off-peak times and go all the way up to 100,000 points for Category 8 properties during peak times.\n\nYou can also transfer your points to over 40 frequent flyer programs to redeem for flights and car services. These typically transfer at a ratio of 3 Marriott points to 1 airline mile. You can also earn a 5,000-mile bonus by transferring 60,000 points to one of the participating frequent flyer programs.\n\nMarriott Bonvoy Moments are an interesting and exciting way to redeem your points. You can buy or bid on a number of experiences from five different categories including culinary, entertainment, lifestyle, sports, and various partner programs. These are generally exclusive experiences that you wouldn't be able to purchase with cash.\n\nAdditional Marriott Bonvoy Business card benefits\n\nAnnual free night award\n\nEvery year, on your account anniversary, you'll receive one free night (worth up to 35,000 points) which can be used at all participating hotels. This perk itself makes up the Bonvoy Business card's $125 annual fee, as long as you use it each year. You'll receive an additional free night reward for hotels that cost up to 35,000 points if you use your card for $60,000 in purchases in a calendar year.\n\nComplimentary Silver Marriott elite status\n\nAs soon as you activate your card you'll receive complimentary Marriott Bonvoy Silver elite status.\n\nSilver elite status members receive:\n\n10% bonus points on eligible hotel purchases including room rates, dining, and spas.\n\nPriority late checkout (based on availability)\n\nDedicated elite reservation line\n\nUltimate reservation guarantee\n\nIf you spend $35,000 in a calendar year, you'll automatically be upgraded to Marriott Bonvoy Gold status through the end of the next calendar year.\n\nGold status perks include:\n\n25% bonus points\n\nEnhanced room upgrades (based on availability)\n\n2pm late checkout\n\nGifts of 250 or 500 points on arrival\n\nNote that you automatically get Marriott Gold elite status with the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant\u2122 American Express\u00ae Card and the Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express.\n\n15 night credit for elite status\n\nEvery calendar year you'll receive 15 additional nights toward your elite status just for having this card. This means you'll only need to stay 35 nights instead of 50 to receive Platinum elite status, the lowest status level that comes with free breakfast at Marriott hotels.\n\nWhile the Marriott Bonvoy Business may not be our top choice for an all-around travel rewards credit card, there are a number of perks that make it a great option for businesses that prefer the Marriott properties.
