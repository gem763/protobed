But we spoke with some very experienced beard experts \u2014 barbers and grooming gurus, many of whom sport beards themselves \u2014 and they told us that, in fact, beard brushes can make a big difference, because they are designed specifically to tame often coarser facial hair. According to them, a healthy brushing can quickly transform a messy beard into a smart and well-groomed one. \u201cIt\u2019s an essential tool for keeping the beard looking smooth,\u201d says Chad Beightol, the owner of men\u2019s grooming boutique Consigliere. \u201cIf you think of beard hair like head hair, it takes a little bit of effort to keep everything in place. Beard brushes allow you to get all of the hair going in the same direction and keep flyaway strands from poking out.\u201d\n\nIn addition to smoothing wayward beards, the experts told us that beard brushes exfoliate hard-to-reach skin beneath a beard, and they also help \u201cspread the natural oils of your skin and facial hair,\u201d according to Tony DeAngelis of Brooklyn\u2019s Blue and Black barbershop. DeAngelis adds that a brush can also help evenly distribute any sort of beard oil or beard balm throughout your beard: \u201cUsing a brush daily with a few drops of a good beard oil will do wonders for a scruffy beard.\u201d In order to find the best beard brushes, we asked Beightol, DeAngelis, and six other beard experts for their recommendations. Read on for their favorites.\n\nBest overall beard brush\n\nKent Boar Bristle Beard and Mustache Brush $48 (was $50, now 4% off) If you\u2019re shopping for a beard brush, all of the experts recommend going for one made with boars\u2019 hair. As Beightol explains, boars\u2019 hair \u201chas the right strength for facial hair, and the texture of boars\u2019 hair will help to distribute oils in the beard.\u201d Kent\u2019s U.K.-made boars\u2019 hair beard brushes came recommended by four of our experts; the brand makes them in a variety of shapes and sizes, but three of the pros specifically mentioned this smaller brush with a handle. \u201cI really love this beard brush,\u201d says DeAngelis, adding that the smaller brush head allows \u201cbetter control and detail when styling your beard.\u201d Barber Angelo Ruscetta is another fan of the company, and told us that \u201cKent makes an awesome beard brush. They\u2019re expensive, but they\u2019re the best.\u201d He likes the ergonomics of this brush\u2019s handle, and says that its angled bristles are \u201cmade to glide through the hair.\u201d $48 at Amazon Buy $48 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beard brush for short beards\n\nZeus Boar Hair Beard and Mustache Brush, Soft Bristle While the premium-priced Kent brushes were the most recommended by the pros, the second-most recommended beard-brush brand was Zeus, endorsed by Beightol and Xavier Rodriguez of Fellow Barber Soho. According to Beightol, \u201cZeus makes some of the best beard brushes around and they\u2019re very popular with bearded guys. The quality and price are great.\u201d When picking a beard brush, the two most popular options are smaller brushes with handles, or larger \u201cmilitary-style\u201d brushes that are either rectangular or oval-shaped. You\u2019ll also need to choose between soft or firm bristles. \u201cPicking the right one is dependent upon the thickness and fullness of a beard,\u201d explains Beightol, who says that a \u201csofter-haired\u201d brush like this one is ideal for \u201cshorter or thinner beards.\u201d And if you\u2019re wondering if there\u2019s really a need to use a brush with short beards, Gary Priore, founder of New York Beard & Company, told us it can still make a difference: \u201cBrushing always helps, even with a short beard. It helps you take away dead skin cells and helps stimulate the follicles of hair which actually can help promote growth.\u201d $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beard brushes for long beards\n\nZeus Boar Hair Military Style Beard Brush, Firm Bristle \u201cFor thick or long beards, a firm-haired brush is more effective,\u201d says Beightol. He recommends this larger firm-haired oval brush, also made by Zeus, for taming bigger beards. Military style brushes like this generally have more surface area covered with bristles, which means they can comb through more hair at once. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nKent Boar Hair Oval Beard Brush If you\u2019re looking for a firm bristled brush by our top-recommended brand, Ruscetta suggests this oval, military-style option. $58 at Amazon Buy $58 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) military-style beard brush\n\nDiane Fromm Curved 100% Boar Military Brush Soft Bristle For a very affordable military-style option, barber Allen Levenson of Epic Barbershop NYC likes this soft bristled brush made by Diane. Given what the other experts said about short bristles being better for short beards, and long bristles for long beards, this might be a good option if you\u2019ve got a shorter beard, but would prefer to use a tool without a handle. \u201cThe soft bristles don\u2019t hurt your face when you brush,\u201d says Levenson, and he likes the \u201cefficiency\u201d of the larger brush head. $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest synthetic bristle beard brush\n\nSuavecito Synthetic Hair Beard Brush All of the experts recommended a boars hair beard brush as the best option, but there are also brushes with synthetic bristles. So if you\u2019re vegan or don\u2019t like the idea of using a boars\u2019 hair brush for whatever reason, you can still find a good one. Ruscetta likes this one from Suavecito, which still looks like a traditional, military-style beard brush with its oblong-shaped wooden base. $22 at Amazon Buy $22 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beard brush for travel\n\nZeus Boar Hair Pocket Beard Brush, Firm Bristle Rodriguez likes this smaller \u201cpocket beard brush\u201d from Zeus because, as he puts it, \u201cthe best beard brush is the one you have with you.\u201d Like all of Zeus\u2019 beard brushes, it comes with a handy drawstring bag, and the small size means it should easily fit in a coat pocket or a Dopp kit. This one has firm boars\u2019 hair bristles, but it\u2019s also available in a soft-bristle version. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest travel-sized round beard brush\n\nBFWood Boar Hair Small and Round Beard Brush Here\u2019s another small, travel-friendly beard brush recommended by Priore, who told us that while he also uses a more standard-sized rectangular beard brush, he loves having this \u201csmall and round\u201d brush on hand too. \u201cIt provides a more laser-focused approach to what hairs I need to keep in check,\u201d he explains. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
