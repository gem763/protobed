I believe these fields are of common interest and will serve as a strong foundation for future collaboration.\"\n\nJarno Syrjala, Finnish ambassador to China, said China and Finland have had a rich history of diverse collaboration, from energy to winter sports, since establishing formal diplomatic relations in 1950.\n\n\"In the past 100 years after its independence (in 1917), Finland went from being a poor country to becoming one of the most developed and stable countries in the world, and education has been a very important driver,\" he said, adding that globalization and automation have led to new challenges that will require countries to raise their education capabilities to new heights.\n\nSyrjala said many Finnish universities and research institutes have conducted extensive collaboration with their Chinese partners, focusing on renewable energy, waste management and smart grids. \"For China, this cooperation is key to building a future smart city and ensuring smart living.\"\n\nThe challenge of sustainable transition is \"common for all of us\", he said. \"But in this transition, the position of China is particularly crucial. And I am very happy to see China and Chinese institutions are taking an active role in the global arena and are taking the next step to find the best technological solutions.\"\n\nZhang Xiliang, the director of the Institute for Energy, Environment and Economy at Tsinghua University, said global climate change, pollution, human development and modernizing industry are key topics for sustainable transition.\n\n\"How to balance national priorities with sustainable development is the big question of our time,\" he said, adding stronger administrative support, more resources for R&D and standardization, as well as more effective market-based instruments are part of the grand solution to sustainable challenges.\n\nEija Tynkkynen, the commercial counselor at the Finnish embassy in Beijing, said Chinese and Finnish businesses can play a bigger role in promoting research and collaboration related to sustainable development.\n\nTynkkynen said Finnish companies have developed many world-class innovations, including bio-based packaging, renewable diesel, and recycling wastes such as saw dust and plastics into useful industrial ingredients like bioethanol.\n\nAt the same time, Finnish companies like Savosolar and Heliostorage are participating in building key technology applications for the renewable energy network in the Guangzhou Nansha demonstration zone in Guangdong province, she said.\n\n\"We hope to combine business and research innovation to provide better living environment for all,\" she said.", "description": "Beijing forum discusses transition to a sustainable future", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/25/5db2cb2ea310cf3e97a30274.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
