Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected 2016 victory was a bit awkward for his running mate\u2019s political future and for his homelife, according to a new book about the vice president.\n\nInstead of getting to run himself for the GOP nomination in 2020, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence would have to spend the next four years cleaning up after Trump, journalist Tom LoBianco writes in his book \u201cPiety & Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House\u201d that publishes this month.\n\nAnd then there was his angry wife.\n\nKaren Pence had twice rebuffed her husband\u2019s celebratory kiss on election night before exploding, during a briefing the next day with Secret Service agents, over concerns about how the financially-strapped couple would pay for their new life.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do Mike?? We don\u2019t have any money! Who\u2019s going to pay for my inaugural gown??\u201d LoBianco quotes Karen Pence as saying.\n\nPence's office declined to comment about the book.\n\nTrump ended up arranging for the inaugural committee to cover some updates to the vice presidential residence and to buy Karen Pence two ball gowns \u2013 an original and the cost of altering that dress into one she liked better, according to the book.\n\nVice President Mike Pence helps wife, Karen, down the steps of the front porch of the vice presidential residence at the U.S Naval Observatory before heading to the inaugural balls in Washington, D.C., with their children on Jan. 20, 2017.

He invested in a pair of privately held companies which failed, according to LoBianco. Pence, whom the author describes as being in awe of those who make money, later lost close to $700,000 more in stock he\u2019d held in the family\u2019s gas station and convenience store business, which went bankrupt in 2001.\n\nThose are some of the many details that LoBianco includes in the latest book that tries to answer the question of who is Mike Pence \u2013 and why the devout Christian has entwined himself with Trump.\n\nThe cover of Tom LoBianco's book \"Piety and Power\" coming out in September. (Photo: HarperCollins Publishers)\n\nLoBianco describes Pence as indecisive, but great at executing others' decisions. A \"pleaser,\" Pence is kept on track by his \u201cbulldog\u201d wife and is easily manipulated by staff, according to the book.\n\nPence shines on the fundraising circuit and is skilled at bringing together disparate personalities with his genial attitude and self-effacing humor, he writes. But LoBianco describes Pence as governing like an \u201camateur\u201d in Indiana. And he says that the inability of Pence, a former six-term congressman, to deliver the votes to repeal Obamacare drove a wedge between him and Trump.\n\nLoBianco writes that the common thread in the disparate descriptions others have given of the vice president \u2014 a Svengali pulling Trump\u2019s strings, or a glorified coatrack \u2014 is Pence\u2019s \u201chidden nature.\u201d\n\nStill, he concludes that Pence is in the White House, serving someone like Trump, because \u201cin the end, ambition and the hunger for power outweighed anything else.\u201d\n\nIs Mike Pence channeling Queen Esther?: Book examines this and more\n\nTom LoBianco, author of \"Piety and Power,\" poses for a portrait at National Harbor in Fort Washington, Md., June 17, 2019. \"Piety and Power\" comes out this fall in September. (Photo: Lawrence Jackson)\n\nLoBianco, a former reporter for the Associated Press and The Indianapolis Star, covered Pence during his challenging years as Indiana governor.\n\nThe book includes many behind-the-scenes details of the controversial \u201creligious freedom\u201d law Pence supported, which critics said would sanction discrimination against the LGBT community for religious reasons.\n\nMost notably, he credits Paul Singer, the hedge-fund billionaire who Pence had been courting for a potential presidential bid, with convincing him to agree to change the law. Singer, whose son is gay, is an ardent supporter of LGBT rights inside the GOP.\n\nEven after Pence reluctantly signed the revised law, most of Indiana\u2019s most important GOP donors were not ready to back Pence\u2019s re-election bid, according to the book.\n\nWhile his aides arranged a meeting between Pence and a transgendered state worker to help the governor better understand the gay community, Pence couldn\u2019t understand how the country could view him as a monster, LoBianco writes. In fact, when Pence\u2019s son asked if it would be OK for his fiancee\u2019s gay best friend to be the Man of Honor at their 2016 wedding, Pence and his wife readily agreed.\n\nBut that \u201clove the sinner, hate the sin,\u201d approach has continued to provoke controversy for Pence, who did not run for re-election as governor after Trump made him his running mate.\n\nBefore Indiana\u2019s decisive presidential primary in May 2016, former President George W. Bush had asked Pence, through intermediaries, to save the Republican Party by stopping Trump from getting the nomination, according to the book.\n\nDescribing Pence\u2019s lukewarm endorsement of Ted Cruz that also included praise for Trump, LoBianco quotes an unnamed Cruz aide saying that Pence doesn\u2019t make his own decisions but is manipulated by staff. An anonymous Trump adviser said Pence lacks confidence.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, center, looks on as House Minority Leader Rep.

Chris Christie.\n\nIf Trump wants a \u201ckiller,\u201d Pence said, he\u2019s not that guy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy myself,\u201d LoBianco quotes Pence saying. \u201cI\u2019m going to be respectful. I\u2019m going to do things with my own style because that\u2019s how I\u2019m comfortable.\u201d\n\nChris Christie book: Mike Pence was stunned on election night\n\nPence\u2019s comfort level was severely tested by the release, during the campaign, of the Access Hollywood recording in which Trump had bragged about grabbing women\u2019s genitals.\n\nA few select donors delivered back-channel messages to Pence that the party had a contingency plan to replace Trump on the ticket with Pence, according to the book. But helping to remove Trump would be political suicide. And even as friends texted him to leave the ticket to save himself, Pence knew that Trump was the future of the GOP, LoBianco writes.\n\nHe describes Karen Pence as initially livid after the release of the recording. But then she tells top aide Marty Obst that the couple had always known there would be times that Trump said and did things that they would never do. That doesn\u2019t change the mission, she added.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence arrive at a rally for President Trump.
