Even Harry and Meghan seem to be at it, modelling their marital home, according to reports, on Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire.\n\nCountry style: Soho Farmhouse\n\n\u2018Hotels are a hotbed of inspiration because not only will the space most likely have been designed by one of the leading names in interior design, but you are able to physically try and test everything there,\u2019 says Sophie Coryton, founder of The Room Service, an online store dedicated to selling interiors used in upmarket hotels.\n\n\u2018You know that the cushion is as comfortable as it is beautiful, that the cups are lovely to drink from or \u2014 perhaps in the case of Harry and Meghan \u2014 that the copper bath is glorious to lie in and runs beautifully.\u2019\n\nBut there needs to be an element of discretion \u2014 you should consider your own home and its character when applying hotel style.\n\nBen Thompson, the designer behind the refurbished Heckfield Place in Hampshire, says it\u2019s important to respond to the age and character of your property. \u2018The key is to look around to see what\u2019s relevant and what\u2019s missing from your palette at home,\u2019 he says.\n\nMISMATCHED FURNITURE\n\nKey design details at the Soho House chain, as well as Heckfield Place, are their mix of new and vintage pieces. \u2018Mismatched furniture brings a lived-in feeling to a space,\u2019 Thompson says. He and his team scoured auction houses, but eBay is also a valuable resource.\n\nAlternatively, try the new online interiors store, Ceraudo, with pieces like a Giulia Cocktail Chair (\u00a3770, ceraudo.com), or Soho Home, the chain\u2019s interiors side, with copy-cat furniture such as its mid-century bedside tables (\u00a3395, sohohome.com).\n\nThompson cautions against using too many different woods, however, \u2018as they can collide with each other and feel uncomfortable\u2019. One trick he used at Heckfield was to pair a bedside table with a circular table, complete with raw silk skirt.\n\n\u2018It breaks up the timbers and softens the space,\u2019 he says.\n\nGiulia Cocktail chair, \u00a3770, ( ceraudo.com )\n\nBEAUTIFUL BEDDING\n\nA sumptuous bed you can roll around in and gorgeous linen are components of a great night away. Thompson says that vintage beds are hard to find in large sizes, so he had beds custom made for Heckfield.\n\nHand-crafted Hypnos, which have a Royal warrant, so may well feature in Frogmore Cottage, are loved by hotels for their size, feel and durability (hypnosbeds.com).\n\nThen it\u2019s all about the dressing: on the High Street, White Company excels at providing hotel-standard linen. Try the Double Row Cord Bed Linen Collection (from \u00a314, thewhitecompany.com).\n\nComplete the relaxed style with a fluffy bath robe, such as Navy Luxury Brushed Cotton by Desmond & Dempsey (\u00a3105, desmondanddempsey.com).\n\nMAGICAL ACCESSORIES\n\nThe easiest way to update your interiors \u2014 like an outfit \u2014 is with accessories.\n\n\u2018Lighting is so important and something we often bypass a little at home, but beautiful hotels never do,\u2019 Coryton says. Try the Soho House favourites by Samarkand Design (from \u00a355, theroom service.co), or the Chukka tablelamp (\u00a3110, pooky.com).\n\nLikewise, freshly plumped cushions are always in plentiful supply in hotels.\n\nCoryton says the key is investing in cushions with inners that hold their shape, such as patterned designs by maker Susy Paisley, as seen at Pentillie Castle in Cornwall (\u00a375; theroomservice.co).\n\nAlong with bathroom tiles, prints on the walls can transform the look of the room easily \u2014 and cheaply. Illustrator Lucy Auge\u2019s botanical prints feature on the walls of hotels including Beaverbrook Garden House in Surrey, Gleneagles in Perthshire and Pentillie Castle in Cornwall (\u00a312, theroomservice.co), while Soho Home has launched its first print collection (from \u00a3250, sohohome.com/editions).\n\nWindow shopping: Velvet footstools Fringed Flower, \u00a3695, sohohome.com Tivoli, \u00a3279, swooneditions.com Baltimore, \u00a379, cultfurniture.com Gumdrop, \u00a3445, loaf.com Lux, \u00a369, made.com\n\nTINY TOUCHES\n\nThere are even cheaper tricks to making your home feel as luxurious as a hotel.\n\n\u2018Books are lovely to read and look beautiful, but they are acoustically very good \u2014 they soften the space,\u2019 Thompson says.\n\nTo create relaxing scents, he hung fresh herbs by each bed: \u2018We hang up rosemary, fennel or lavender on hooks by the bed, and they smell amazing.\u2019\n\nYou can often buy the hotel smellies as you check out (or later online). Soho House stocks its own re-launched brand Cowshed (cowshed.com),\n\nHeckfield stocks the organic brand Wildsmith Skin (wildsmithskin.com), while Hotel L\u2019oscar in Holborn, London, sells candles, perfumes and soaps by Roja Dove (loscar.com).\n\n\u2018When you have stayed somewhere, everything in that room is imbued with memories \u2014 of a place, a time, an experience,\u2019 Coryton says. \u2018Taking a little bit of it home with you keeps that memory alive.\u2019", "description": "More and more of us are drawing inspiration from high-end hotels.
