The new car answers with a straight flush: handling, straight-line speed, dramatic looks, ride comfort and a dynamite dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nPrices for the 2020 Shelby GT500 start at $70,300. It should be in dealerships any day.\n\nHowling on the outside, quiet on the inside\n\nThe magic starts with the engine, a supercharged 5.2L V8 that can howl like a banshee but leaves the cabin quiet enough for conversation at normal levels. There\u2019s even a \u201cgood neighbor mode\u201d you can program so\u2019s not to wake somebody sleeping next door.\n\nFloor it and the engine races to its 7,500 rpm redline, pushing occupants back like a runaway, well, mustang.\n\nThe 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT 500 is the most powerful street-legal vehicle in Ford's history. More\n\nThe prospect of 625 pound-feet of torque on tap should be enough to scare anybody away from hard acceleration on public streets, but sticky Michelin performance tires and unobtrusive electronics keep the GT500 from being uncomfortably edgy.\n\nThe dual-clutch transmission holds gears for maximum acceleration and delivers satisfying downshifts under braking in sport mode. The Porsche 911\u2019s DCT was the benchmark as Ford developed the new gearbox. Sport mode delivers the quickest shifts, just 8 milliseconds \u2014 quicker than a human can press the clutch in, let alone change gears, according to Ford engineers.\n\nGM earnings: GM says UAW strike cost nearly $3 billion but still turns third-quarter profit\n\nAdaptive shock absorbers keep the car from squatting back on its rear wheels even with the accelerator floored. The ride is surprisingly smooth.\n\nFord specified 20-inch wheels to make room for massive 16.53-inch front brake discs that deliver 25% more heat dissipation than the GT350\u2019s brakes. Improved heat dissipation means the brakes continue to work longer under sudden extreme stops and deceleration from high speeds.\n\nThe 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT 500's supercharged 5.2L V8 generates 760 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque. More\n\nHow high? The carbon fiber aerodynamics package produces a maximum of 550 pounds of downforce to keep the GT500 from leaving the ground \u2014 at 180 mph.\n\nThe thick steering wheel wrapped in suede-like Alcantara sets you up for success when the white line is at 12 o\u2019clock to let you know when wheels are aimed dead ahead, an important consideration when you could be drag-racing at wide-open throttle from a standstill.\n\nThat same steering wheel connects to a rack that\u2019s unique to the GT500, with extra-large electric motors to turn the big, sticky tires. Response is quick, but not nervous, just what you want driving around the technical street course at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.\n\nEvery GT500 engine is signed by the person who built it.
