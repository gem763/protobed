Other options include Himalayan Salt Caramel, Alphonso Mango and Green Tea.\n\nEither way, there\u2019s mochi to choose from (sorry).\n\nMORE: KFC is selling an 80-piece popcorn chicken bucket for less than \u00a36\n\nMORE: Prosecco Christmas crackers are back for 2019\n\nMORE: Cadbury announces its Easter range for next year and people are confused\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The brand is known for its Japanese ice cream bites, known as mochi balls, and will be releasing a new flavour, as well as hosting a pop-up.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92277744_1572017800.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
