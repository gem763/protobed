The two leaders will need to find common cause if talks are not to collapse entirely. The atmosphere surrounding the negotiations has turned sour in recent days as the two sides blamed each other for their failure to make progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still cautiously, cautiously optimistic,\u201d Johnson said as he described the negotiations he\u2019s had with Britain\u2019s \u201cfriends and partners in the EU.\u201d\n\nDespite the premier\u2019s soothing tone, European politicians continued to react strongly to what they see as the \u201cblame game\u201d initiated by Johnson\u2019s officials, who have accused Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel of making a deal essentially impossible.\n\n\u201cWe are not accepting this blame game which started in London -- we are not to be blamed,\u201d European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Wednesday.\n\nAs has been the case for much of the past three years, the key hurdle has been how to ensure there are no customs checkpoints at Ireland\u2019s land border with the U.K.\n\nIn his latest plan, Johnson proposed limited customs checks away from the frontier, but Varadkar insists any such inspections will threaten peace in the region, which suffered decades of terrorism.\n\nThe EU\u2019s remaining 27 member states will be guided by Ireland\u2019s position. If Johnson can convince Varadkar to move, there is a chance a deal could be outlined ahead of the crucial summit of EU leaders Oct. 17-18.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Possible\u2019\n\nThe biggest area of dispute relates to customs arrangements on the Irish border. On Wednesday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier rejected the U.K.\u2019s proposal to work out the mechanism for customs checks during a post-Brexit transition period. Putting these decisions off would risk leading to \u201cno checks whatsoever,\u201d and that would damage the EU\u2019s single market, Barnier said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really in a position where we\u2019re able to find an agreement,\u201d Barnier said. It\u2019s possible \u201cif there\u2019s goodwill on both sides.\u201d\n\nBarnier also criticized the U.K.\u2019s plan to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto over the deal. Johnson\u2019s team say it\u2019s vital to allow the region\u2019s community to give \u201cconsent\u201d for the future arrangements on the border.\n\nBut for the EU, allowing a veto for Northern Irish politicians would undermine the point of a long-term guarantee against a hard border going up at the frontier.\n\nBoth sides want clarity on the status of the negotiations by the end of the week. If the talks do break down in the days ahead, the U.K. will either be headed for a no-deal split or a humiliating third delay to the divorce, an outcome Johnson himself has vowed never to permit but which the EU is ready to grant.\n\nIn other developments on Wednesday:\n\nThe British Parliament scheduled an emergency sitting for Oct. 19 to discuss the outcome of the EU summit. It will be the first weekend session of the House of Commons since the Falklands War in 1982.Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay is planning to meet Barnier in Brussels, on Friday.Scottish judges postponed a decision on whether they need to send a letter demanding a delay to Brexit if Johnson doesn\u2019t.The Times reported that the EU is ready to offer the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote to exit the so-called backstop arrangements hated by Brexiteers.
