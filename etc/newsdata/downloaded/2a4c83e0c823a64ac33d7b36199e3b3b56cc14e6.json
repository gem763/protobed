It\u2019s because they have been teaching CPR in schools since 1961.\n\n\u2018The figures will only change once this becomes more than a one-off.\n\nHow YOU can use CPR to help restart someone's heart Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be used to try to restart someone's heart if it has stopped. CPR should only be used in an emergency situation if someone is unconscious and not breathing. People without CPR training should stick to hands-only chest compressions, the NHS says. To carry out a chest compression: Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person\u2019s chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and interlock your fingers. Position yourself with your shoulders above your hands. Using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5-6cm (2-2.5 inches) on their chest. Keeping your hands on their chest, release the compression and allow the chest to return to its original position. Repeat these compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 times per minute until an ambulance arrives or you become exhausted.

Yes, it will take a little while, but at the other end is we\u2019ll have a whole community of children who\u2019ve grown up with these skills and who know what to do.\n\n\u2018We need a critical mass of people in the community with these skills for us to be able to turn our numbers around.\u2019 The Government announced in January that from September 2020 it will be compulsory for all children to be trained in CPR by the time they leave secondary school aged 16 - but doctors believe it should be introduced much earlier in the school system.\n\nDr Ezihe-Ejiofor is leading a voluntary programme training children how to do CPR - but she believes this should become routine.\n\nLast week she and 20 other medical volunteers led a training morning in South London for the annual Restart a Heart day.\n\nMore than 70 primary school children aged between nine and ten were invited to Ivydale Primary School in Lambeth.\n\nSplit into groups of around a dozen pupils and four instructors, they were taught how to react when someone collapses using mannequins and the acronym \u2018DRS ABC\u2019 (Danger, response, shout, airways, breathing, CPR).\n\nDeputy Headteacher Judith Lambert said: \u2018Hopefully they will remember the fundamentals. If you learn it at an early enough age you can keep that skill with you for life.\n\n\u2018As an adult if you learn something it becomes much harder to remember but if it becomes part of their understanding now then they can use it at any point.\u2019 Shakira Kamara, 9, from Loughborough primary school in Lambeth, added: \u2018It\u2019s important we learn about things like this because if something bad happened we would be prepared.\n\n\u2018I would feel more confident now because we\u2019ve practiced and seen what to do.\u2019 Dr James Cant, chief executive of the Resuscitation Council UK said: \u2018CPR saves lives. We encourage young people to learn CPR and have the confidence to use it in an emergency, as it truly is a skill for life.\u2019 A Department for Education spokesman said: \u2018It is important that all children are taught basic skills that could save lives, which is why first aid will be a compulsory part of Health Education from 2020.\n\n\u2018All primary school pupils will be taught about how to contact the emergency services and basic first aid - and if schools feel it\u2019s appropriate they can teach CPR.\u2019", "description": "Some 30,000 people suffer a cardiac arrest in the UK every year, and fewer than one in seven survive.", "authors": ["Alec Fullerton For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/23/19969300-0-image-a-3_1571612394233.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
