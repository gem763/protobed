But a delay looks likely after he suffered an initial defeat in parliament on Saturday over his plans.\n\nIf Johnson gets his way, analysts at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank estimate that weaker trade ties with the EU will badly damage Britain's economy and reduce tax revenues by up to 49 billion pounds a year compared with staying in.\n\nThe somewhat closer ties proposed by his predecessor Theresa May - which parliament rejected three times - would have lowered government revenue by about 39 billion pounds over the medium term.\n\nNew finance minister Sajid Javid said early in September that he was \"turning the page on austerity\", and is due to present detailed budget plans on Nov. 6.\n\nHe promised the biggest spending increases in 15 years - a move widely seen as preparation for a potential snap election that Johnson wants to break the Brexit impasse - and also plans to set out new longer-term fiscal rules at the budget.\n\nTuesday's figures showed a 5.4% rise in day-to-day government spending on public services for the year to date, while tax revenues rose by 2.8%.\n\nCorporation tax receipts fell by 1.1%, the biggest fall in the first half of a tax year since 2013.\n\nLast month the ONS sharply revised up its estimates of Britain's public borrowing to better account for the likelihood that many graduates will not repay all their student loans, as well as an overestimate of corporation tax received last year.\n\nBorrowing totalled 1.9% of GDP in 2018/19, according to the latest figures.\n\nDespite the statistical revisions, British public borrowing last year was still the lowest since 2001/02, and down from a peak of 10.2% of GDP reached in 2009/10 just after the depths of the financial crisis.\n\nAs in most other big economies, debt is still much higher than before the crisis, however.\n\nTuesday's figures showed that public sector net debt totalled 80.3% of GDP in September, excluding public-sector banks, or 72.2% once the effect of a temporary Bank of England lending scheme was stripped out too.\n\nBritain's debt-to-GDP ratio was below 40% before the 2008/09 financial crisis.", "description": "UK public finances weaken in first half of tax year ahead of Brexit budget", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9L0PA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
