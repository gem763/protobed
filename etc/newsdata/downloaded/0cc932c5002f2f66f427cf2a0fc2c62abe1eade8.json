It's like the commission overshadowed what was the heart of its mandate.\"\n\n'What do we do with the women who came forward?'\n\nAfter Radio-Canada's investigative program Enqu\u00eate revealed the allegations in Val-d'Or in 2015, eight SQ officers were suspended and there was an investigation by Montreal police, but none of the officers were ever charged.\n\nThe commission was launched amid mounting pressure for the provincial government to act.\n\nThe previous Liberal government gave the commission a broad mandate: to look at the relationship between Indigenous people and a range of public services, not just the police.\n\n\"I recognize the work that Commissioner Viens has done,\" said Viviane Michel, president of Quebec Native Women.\n\n\"But the big thing that is missing is really the safety of Indigenous women. What do we do with the women who came forward?\"\n\nEdith Cloutier is executive director of Val-d'Or's Native Friendship Centre. (CBC)\n\nMichel testified twice at the commission and her group made a series of recommendations around policing and the justice system, including the creation of a professional order for police officers and a special tribunal to handle sexual assault cases.\n\nMichel said many of their recommendations were overlooked in the commissioner's calls to action.\n\n\"I cannot hide my disappointment,\" she said. \"Our women need to be safe, our women need protection.\"\n\nThe commissioner did recommend amending the province's Police Act to extend the time limit from one year to three for filing police ethics complaints, and information campaigns to raise awareness about existing complaints processes among Indigenous populations.\n\nAt a news conference following the report's release, Quebec Public Security Minister Genevi\u00e8ve Guilbault said, \"We cannot comment on the choices that were made by the commissioner\" when it comes to his recommendations.\n\nBut she said the government will \"keep on working to improve the general feeling of safety,\" of Indigenous women.\n\nIn a statement, the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec said it will collaborate with stakeholders around the report's recommendations.\n\nIt added it plans to work with \"the government, the First Nations and all of our partners to follow through on the effort to build a relationship of trust and respect.\"\n\nOne of the police unions, the Association des policiers et polici\u00e8res du Quebec, said it supports most of the calls to action, but in a statement underscored that a commission of inquiry is not a trial, and said commission reports are essentially hearsay evidence.\n\nApology from the province\n\nRetired Superior Court justice Jacques Viens headed the commission, which toured the province. (Vincent Desjardins/Radio-Canada)\n\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault has invited Indigenous leaders, including Cloutier and Michel, to Quebec's National Assembly on Wednesday, where he is expected to deliver an apology, something the Viens report recommends.\n\nWhile Michel welcomes such a gesture, she wants more than that.\n\n\"I agree to receive an apology, but can we also have concrete commitments to the implementation of these recommendations?\"\n\nWATCH - From The National, Quebec should apologize to Indigenous people, Viens report says:", "description": "A new report that found Indigenous people face systemic discrimination in public services in Quebec doesn\u2019t do enough to address the allegations of police abuse that led to the commission in the first place, an advocate says.", "authors": ["Alison Northcott Is A National Reporter For Cbc News In Montreal.", "Follow Alison On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303765.1569894554!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/viens.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
