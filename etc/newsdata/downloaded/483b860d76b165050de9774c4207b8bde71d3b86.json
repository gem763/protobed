Photo-Illustration: by Preeti Kinha; Photos Getty\n\nMercury, Venus, Mars, and the sun will all stay in wise and steady Virgo all week. It\u2019s a powerful, concentrated energy, and you can use it to bear witness to the world\u2019s chaos without losing your head. You can use it to hold those you love close even as the sky changes around you. You can use it to see through every deception, and to envision the world you really want.\n\nAries Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis is a week for loving the world, and the people in it, and yourself too, with everything you\u2019ve got. It might sound a little trite, but it isn\u2019t easy to keep seeing the good in the world in the face of real darkness. This week, you don\u2019t have to let yourself be drawn into shouting matches; you don\u2019t have to persuade every hostile stranger to change their ways. The heat your bright energy gives off could burn down a whole building if you wanted it to, but it could do something better, too. It power the whole city if you let it.\n\nTaurus Weekly Horoscope\n\nMaybe there\u2019s a piece of you that still feels drawn to the idea of a life where everything is simple, where everything\u2019s been decided for you already. Maybe there\u2019s a piece of you that\u2019s just tired of change. This week, though, is for accepting that the future is broad and uncertain, and that uncertainty means there\u2019s still space left to move in. Water cycles from sky to earth and back, and your body rebuilds itself over and over again. The end hasn\u2019t arrived yet, which means that there\u2019s still reason to keep trying.\n\nGemini Weekly Horoscope\n\nSometimes, expansive generosity can feel so natural and right to you that it\u2019s hard to see when you\u2019re giving too much. It\u2019s hard not to feel like it\u2019s up to you to make all the people in your life happy, to give them all the sweetness or understanding or fun they need. This week, give yourself permission to take a small step backward. Give yourself permission to consider your own needs, and to choose your next steps with care.\n\nCancer Weekly Horoscope\n\nEverything has a use and a purpose, and that goes for your own feelings, too. Sometimes you imagine that your more difficult feelings\u2014like loneliness, like jealousy, like fear\u2014are markers of weakness or lack, but that\u2019s not really true at all. Sometimes, when you feel things like this, it\u2019s just your body telling you that you deserve more. You deserve a life of connection and community and love, a life of abundance and freedom. Sometimes, of course, a bad feeling is simply a feeling, but sometimes it\u2019s a message that you don\u2019t have to settle for scraps.\n\nLeo Weekly Horoscope\n\nWhen you consider all the lives you\u2019ve lived, all the people you\u2019ve loved, all the versions of yourself you\u2019ve tried to be, it can start to feel oppressive\u2014so much history weighing you down, so many memories fogging up your vision. Even if you\u2019ve mostly moved on, there might be feelings or hopes you\u2019re not quite willing to let go of. But even though you can\u2019t get rid of your past, this is a week where you can stop trying to carry it all with you so actively. You can let some things end; you can feel your body here, right now, where the ground is solid and the air is clear.\n\nVirgo Weekly Horoscope\n\nIt\u2019s so important, this week, not to assume you already know what the future is going to look like, or what it will sound like, or how it will feel inside of your head. It\u2019s so important not to assume that the end is foretold, not to start agonizing over things you haven\u2019t even done yet. Assume, instead, that time is pliant and mysterious. Assume you have powers you haven\u2019t yet discovered. Give yourself permission to live as though there\u2019s unimagined potential in every sweet, pink morning.\n\nLibra Weekly Horoscope\n\nSomewhere deep inside yourself, you already know so many of the answers you\u2019ve been seeking.You know the change you need to make, or which choice is the right one. You already know the shape of your feelings, and you know what they\u2019re calling you to do. The challenge right now isn\u2019t finding answers, but learning how to accept the answers you have. This isn\u2019t easy to do; it can feel much better to keep waiting in the hopes that a simpler solution will appear. Be a little patient with yourself this week as you process what your body already knows.\n\nScorpio Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis is a week to take seriously your connection to the world around you. Don\u2019t imagine you can hold yourself separate from the wild, green world, or that you can see it clearly from outside. You don\u2019t have to think about mending everything around you\u2014you don\u2019t even have to think about personal success or failure. Instead, think about how you want to live in relation to other people, and how the small and big actions you take can connect or disconnect you.\n\nSagittarius Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis is a week to finish the projects that need finishing, to wrap them up and let them go. You don\u2019t have to keep fiddling forever. You don\u2019t need to attain perfection before you can complete the work, before you can learn anything from it, before you can put away your tools and rest. Completing something only means that you\u2019ve completed it, and right now, that\u2019s the best thing to focus on.\n\nCapricorn Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, pay attention to ways you might be useful to the world without appearing, necessarily, to be productive. Not everything leads to appreciation or money, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important. There\u2019s nothing wrong with desiring appreciation or with money, of course, just notice the way it can limit your thinking. This week, as you strive to be of use and to earn your keep on this planet, try to broaden your ideas of what it could mean to live a valuable life.\n\nAquarius Weekly Horoscope\n\nSeeing the world as clearly as you do can lead to frustration and grief. It\u2019s so hard to live with a mind so sharp and alive, but a body trapped here on the ground. It\u2019s so hard to imagine all these different ways the world could be good and sweet, while seeing all the ways it just keeps getting harsher. This week, though, don\u2019t let your frustration turn you bitter and cold. Even in the weirdest circumstances, you know how to keep loving the world, how to keep believing in something better than this.\n\nPisces Weekly Horoscope\n\nYou can sense the importance of making wise choices right now, but the wise choices aren\u2019t necessarily the safe choices. Taking risks doesn\u2019t always have to be foolhardy; in certain circumstances, it\u2019s the only move that makes any sense at all. It can be a way to express real care for yourself, for the people you love, for the future. It can be a way to signal, to whoever is watching, that you\u2019re still willing to try, still willing to fight, still willing to believe in the possibility of a beautiful life.\n\nGet Madame Clairevoyant every week.
