But he also opened a front with Congress that may prove unsustainable.\n\nFrom steadfast GOP allies and liberal Democrats backing an impeachment inquiry, the blowback to Trump is coming from all angles, suggesting a real bipartisan pressure campaign that could force the president to reverse himself.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is reminding Trump of supermajorities supporting a U.S. presence in Syria. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is threatening sanctions against Turkey in partnership with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). And a bipartisan pair of Senate Foreign Relations Committee members are demanding administration officials testify before Congress.\n\n\"The president\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal that will have grave humanitarian and national security consequences,\" said Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \"We will be working with committee leadership to assure that the administration appears before the committee as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe Republican Senate has already shown a willingness to confront Trump on Syria and other foreign policy matters, and the gears are quickly turning in Congress to force Trump to back down.\n\nGraham said Monday he will put forward a Senate resolution asking Trump to change course, predicting it \u201cwill receive strong bipartisan support.\u201d In February, 70 senators supported a nonbinding amendment backing U.S. operations in both Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nLawmakers will also have multiple chances to weigh in on Trump\u2019s foreign policy in the coming weeks and months, as Congress must pass its annual defense legislation as well as spending bills to fund the government.\n\nIn a rare statement chiding Trump, McConnell referenced the amendment adopted earlier this year, noting \u201cthe conditions that produced that bipartisan vote still exist today.\u201d\n\n\u201cISIS and al Qaeda remain dangerous forces in Syria and the ongoing Syrian civil war poses significant security and humanitarian risks. A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime,\u201d the GOP leader said. \u201cI urge the president to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS.\u201d\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., begins a markup over immigration policy on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Aug. 1, 2019. The Senate Judiciary Committee is engaged in a heated battle over immigration policy as chairman Lindsey Graham threatens to upend the rules to advance a detention bill that Democrats oppose. It\u2019s one last battle, being led Thursday by a top ally of President Donald Trump, before senators break for a long August recess and the start of 2020 campaigning. (AP Photo/J.

Yet he remained unbowed, even as he sought to address the criticism. He told reporters he wants to wind down \"endless wars\" and that he had told Turkish President Recep Erdo\u011fan not to do anything that's \"not humane\" to the Kurds.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cThe U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.
