We all built it, but you were such a massive part of it. Bigger than you were given credit for. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\nIt was a stark contrast from the president who over the summer told four progressive congresswomen of color to go back to where they came from and blasted Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings\u2019 congressional district as \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s speech marked the second time in the past month Trump participated in an event with an overwhelmingly black audience. In September, he addressed leaders of historically black colleges and universities.\n\nTrump made both broad and personal appeals to black voters Friday. He praised conservative commentators Candace Owens and Terrence Williams and White House aide Ja\u2019Ron Smith, individually inviting each of them to join him on stage. Trump complimented Smith for his role with the White House and commended Owens for her television appearances and Williams for his tweets about actress Debra Messing, a Trump foil.\n\nOwens, Trump said, is a \u201cstar\u201d who is not only \u201ctough\u201d but also \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the #MeToo generation, we\u2019re not allowed to say it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo all of you young, brilliant guys, never, ever call a woman beautiful, please. You\u2019re not allowed to do it.\u201d\n\nDespite some projections of a recession, Trump claimed the economy is doing so well that Americans are \u201cfinding jobs and they\u2019re getting good jobs and if you don\u2019t like that job you can get another one because you have a lot of choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we are fighting every day to build up our nation, the far left only wants to wreck, ruin and destroy our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know better than anybody, for the last three years, Democrat lawmakers, their deep-state cronies, the fake news media, they\u2019ve been colluding in their effort to overturn the presidential election \u2014 63 million people voted \u2014 and to nullify the votes of the American people and many African American people voted for Trump, even then. Now they like me more.\u201d\n\nTrump lost the national popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016 by roughly 3 million votes, 63 million to 65.8 million. He won just 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, and 81 percent of African American voters disapprove of his job as president, according to a recent POLITICO/Morning Consult poll.\n\nStill, the Trump campaign hopes it can peel off enough black voters to boost turnout in key states next year, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won by less than 1 percentage point.\n\nThe president argued that Democratic politicians have let down the African American community for more than 100 years but touted how black Americans have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies over the last three years.\n\n\u201cNo one in America has been hurt more as a result of the Democrats\u2019 corrupt leadership and socialist policies than our nation\u2019s African American community,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nTrump name-checked South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott for talking to him about \u201copportunity zones\u201d to spur investment in distressed communities and credited himself for helping pass a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill.\n\nBut he took issue with CNN\u2019s Van Jones and the Rev. Al Sharpton. Trump said Jones thanked Sharpton, who \u201cwas nowhere to be found\u201d as the bill moved through Congress, on his show last month but excluded any mention of the president for his role in the bill\u2019s passage. What Jones did do, Trump recalled, is urge voters to defeat Trump at the ballot box next November.\n\nTrump derided Sharpton as a \u201cconman\u201d who \u201cscared NBC into giving him a show\u201d and insisted Jones called senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, who played a big role behind the scenes in the criminal justice bill\u2019s passage, to apologize.\n\n\u201cHe apologized,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t accept those apologies.\u201d\n\nAfter voicing support for law enforcement, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Trump suggested a number of African Americans live near \u201cbrutal killers\u201d and sometimes become their victims.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re killers, but you\u2019re tough,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cYou fight back. But sometimes you don\u2019t win those fights because these guys are tough, too. They shouldn\u2019t be in our country.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/16/0d/95440684406883dc01b044de65aa/191004-trump-black-voters-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
