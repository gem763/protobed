The 36-year-old is the second player in major league history to earn an MVP, Rookie of the Year and Cy Young \u2014 an award in which he\u2019s finished in the top-5 seven times, with another looming for 2019.\n\nOver his 15-year career, Verlander has amassed more than 3,000 strikeouts and has made eight All-Star Games. He finally got a World Series ring on his third try when the Houston Astros claimed their first championship two years ago.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThere isn\u2019t much left on his MLB bingo card. He even got his first major league hit with the Detroit Tigers in 2014 after going 0-for-26 to start his career. He still doesn\u2019t have a home run or an extra-base hit, though that\u2019s probably not keeping him up at night.\n\nBut on Tuesday night in Game 6 of the World Series against the Washington Nationals, Verlander can accomplish something that\u2019s eluded him for more than a decade. In six World Series starts, he is 0-5 with a 5.73 ERA, and his team has won just one of those games.\n\nThe Astros have an opportunity to clinch their second championship in three years in Game 6 at Minute Maid Park, and Verlander can get a World Series-sized monkey off his back in the process.\n\n\u201cThose are the moments that you dream about,\u201d he told reporters before the Astros\u2019 7-1 victory in Game 5, which gave them a 3-2 series lead. \u201cIt's just having the opportunity to be out there and be on the mound hopefully in a scenario where we can close it out, that's everything I've dreamed of.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the Astros\u2019 12-3 loss in Game 2, an Anthony Rendon double put Verlander in a two-run hole before he could record an out. Kurt Suzuki led off the seventh with a tie-breaking homer, and a walk to the following batter, Victor Robles, ended Verlander\u2019s night.\n\nHe was charged with four runs on seven hits and three walks over six innings. Afterward, he noted the Nationals\u2019 preparedness and ability to make adjustments to different pitchers, especially when altering their approach with two strikes.\n\n\u201cIn today's game you don't see it that often,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, it's kind of refreshing to see a couple of teams that don't swing and miss a ton, and change their approach based on the pitcher that's pitching against them.\u201d\n\nJustin Verlander has never won a World Series game, but he's looking to change that in Game 6 for the Astros.

So far, he\u2019s 6-5 in the second game of the series, with losses in his past four starts in that scenario. He mentioned that there\u2019s more pressure on a pitcher to execute in those types of situations.\n\n\u201cI think those opposing guys, once they've seen you three, four at-bats, it's a little bit easier for them to make adjustments, and having seen your off-speed stuff and tracked it,\u201d he said.\n\nCompared to his stellar regular season, a different version of Verlander has shown up in October \u2014 which, even for a future Hall of Famer, isn\u2019t uncommon. He\u2019ll likely finish second in the Cy Young voting to teammate Gerrit Cole after putting together the second 20-win season of his career while reaching the 300-strikeout plateau for the first time.\n\nBut he\u2019s accumulated a 4.15 ERA this postseason, highlighted by a 3.2-inning start in the ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays in which he yielded four runs. He\u2019s given up six homers in 30.1 innings, which was also a problem in the regular season \u2014 granted with a ball that many believe is physically different \u2014 where he gave up 36 long balls, the third-most among qualified pitchers.\n\nHe\u2019s also averaging 3.26 walks per nine innings this postseason after posting a 1.70 BB/9 in the regular season. Those are the type of things that need to be corrected for Verlander, who owns a 3.15 ERA in potential series-clinching games, to get over this World Series hump.\n\nVerlander will be going up against Stephen Strasburg on Tuesday night. Strasburg\u2019s postseason problems were contrasting to Verlander\u2019s until this year. He\u2019s been at the front of a Nationals\u2019 staff that couldn\u2019t win a postseason series despite his 0.47 ERA in October entering this season.\n\nBut a victory in the wild-card game jump-started a change for the Nationals, and all the while Strasburg has held up his end of the bargain, retaining a 1.34 postseason ERA.\n\nStrasburg\u2019s success is a mix of the personal and team accomplishments that Verlander should hope will line up for him Tuesday. In terms of personal accolades, there isn\u2019t much that Verlander hasn\u2019t accomplished, and the Astros\u2019 success over the past few seasons speaks for itself.\n\nVerlander will likely have more opportunities to capture that elusive World Series victory beyond Tuesday night. He\u2019s under contract for two more seasons with the Astros, who are expected to remain contenders even if Cole bolts in free agency. Recently, he was asked if he feels he can win 75 more games to get to 300 for his career.\n\n\u201cI think I can get pretty darn close,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the changes I've made the last few years to my body and how I pay attention to things is going to allow me to pitch deeper than I would have otherwise.\n\n\u201cIt's definitely a goal of mine.\u201d\n\nHis Hall of Fame credentials were likely validated this season, and he can put one more conversation to rest with a victory when it matters most Tuesday night.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Justin Verlander can bring the Houston Astros a championship with his first World Series victory against the Washington nationals on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Gerard Gilberto"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WATUPwapNATBc85W7e.r8Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aG8Qdh4azTJIpNoTy8gw2w--~B/aD0zNDExO3c9NTExNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8e0b4e50-fa64-11e9-99d6-3e047da177fd", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
