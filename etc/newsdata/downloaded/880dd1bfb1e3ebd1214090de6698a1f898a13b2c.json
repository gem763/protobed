They included taxes of 15% that went into effect on $113 billion of goods imported from China to the US. Trump had previously planned to levy a 10% duty, but increased it as retaliation for further trade measures instated by China.\n\n\"The move clearly shows that 25% is not a ceiling on tariffs and thus must increase materially the uncertainty about the outlook for the trade war for businesses,\" wrote Seth Carpenter, chief US economist at UBS.\n\nAs tariffs have mounted, economic challenges have grown, wrote Carpenter. Data show that imports of goods have fallen 40% because of tariffs, and domestic spending has been consistently weak since tariffs were enacted last year, he said.\n\nIn addition, as more tariffs have been enacted, they've impact consumer goods. This will continue to disrupt production lines, which could lead to a decline in employment, Carpenter said.\n\n\"As a consequence, business investment and household spending suffer,\" he wrote.\n\nCarpenter is also acutely focused on consumption, which he says represents almost 70% of the US economy and therefore largely impacts gross domestic product.\n\nHe says tariffs drag consumption in two ways: (1) higher prices lead to less spending and (2) businesses spend less as well, which can lead them to stop hiring and drive up unemployment. Carpenter expects that the economy will stall in the first half of 2020, and that historic low unemployment rates will tick up to 4.3% by the end of that year.\n\nBut Carpenter still sees the US narrowly avoiding a recession - although he does identify some clear downside risks.\n\n\"A further shock to the economy could result in contraction,\" Carpenter wrote.\n\nHe also says sectors such as energy and retail could slide further, while mounting political risks could also create formidable headwinds.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Trade tensions over the last week show \"25% is not a ceiling on tariffs\" and makes business outlooks less certain, wrote Seth Carpenter of UBS.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8851/68ddbe1a558442b08b44da7bbc3f71dc.jpg"}
