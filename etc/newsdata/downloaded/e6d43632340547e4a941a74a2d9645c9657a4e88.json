He'll let me do anything,\" is what Farmer recalls Epstein saying to her about the billionaire, who has since distanced himself from his long history with the late financier, who died by suicide in federal prison after being charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.\n\nHow Epstein used Wexner's New Albany estate to his advantage, trapping Maria Farmer and sexually assaulting her\n\nNew Albany, OH More\n\nFacebook/New Albany, Ohio Government", "description": "In New Albany, Ohio, Maria Farmer says Jeffrey Epstein assaulted her in a home owned by CEO Les Wexner, with guards who wouldn't let her leave.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qS1MSsdst9Kl3Vvq5Nl75w--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/6007c2bc9a590238e5efa1fe98782fa5", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
