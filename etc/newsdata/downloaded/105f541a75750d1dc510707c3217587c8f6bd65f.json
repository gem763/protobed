The Macdonald-Laurier Institute\u2019s Leading Economic Indicator (LEI), that predicts changes in the Canadian business cycle, rose by 0.2 per cent in August, somewhat lower than previous months but still a six straight month of growth. Indeed, much of the positive economic activity remained concentrated in the housing market, MLI said in a report.\n\n\u201cGrowth is continuing despite a slowing trend,\u201d says LEI author and Munk Senior Fellow Philip Cross. \u201cThough the housing market remains the main source of growth in the economy, August\u2019s numbers paint a less optimistic picture than recent months.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe effects of the turmoil that took hold in the global economy over the summer may not have fully materialized,\u201d Cross added. \u201cCanada may yet experience a more protracted economic slowdown.\u201d\n\nA housing surge is vital as manufacturing and other areas are faltering. Bank of Nova Scotia analysts believe Canadian suppliers to General Motors Co. are likely to report lower-than-expected profits as the strike by the United Auto Workers union enters its fourth week.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian heavy oil\u2019s discount to the U.S. benchmark widened to $15.75 Monday, \u2014 the biggest differential since May \u2014 ahead of an announcement that the Alberta government will ease production limits in exchange for shipping more crude by rail, according to Bloomberg.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s you need to know this morning:\n\nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corp. to release preliminary housing start data for September\n\nStatistics Canada releases building permit data\n\nFirst week of hearings in the case of Commissioner of Competition Tribunal vs. Ticketmaster and parent company Live Nation Entertainment Inc. for allegedly using deceptive ticket pricing practices, demanding it display the full price up front in Toronto\n\nCanadian Wind Energy Association 35th annual CanWEA conference and exhibition in Calgary\n\nThe fall sitting of the Alberta legislature begins in Edmonton\n\nIn Leduc, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Indigenous Relations Minister Rick Wilson on Indigenous partnerships\n\nTransLink CEO Kevin Desmond attends a breakfast meeting to discuss the growing need for more transit, transportation, and commuting options across Metro Vancouver\n\n\n\nMost economic indicators point to a slowdown in the Canadian economy. Impeachment concerns, trade tension and now the new NAFTA (or USMCA) ratification in limbo suggests the economy is not firing on all cylinders.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing cloud of uncertainty for the USMCA is no friend for the Canadian economic outlook,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal. After a powerful rebound in the second quarter, Canada has rapidly adopted the rest of the developed world\u2019s lacklustre growth.Exports are also fading.\n\n\u201cWhile the August trade deficit narrowed a bit below $1 billion, it was all due to better oil prices\u2014net exports will at best be neutral for Q3, after turbocharging Q2. And, more recent, September auto sales dipped again from year-ago levels, roughly matching this year\u2019s average 4% year-on-year drop,\u201d Porter noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Scotiabank also suggested that merchandise imports in the latest trade data \u201craises questions\u201d about the strength of domestic demand, as imports of machinery and equipment (-2.81% month-on-month) as well as consumer products (-3.7% month-on-month) declined.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Send your news, comments and stories to yhussain@postmedia.com. \u2014 Yadullah Hussain @YAD_Fpenergy\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg", "description": "Stuff you need to know", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/cpt503-the-canadian-press1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
