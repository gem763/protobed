One of the reported wallets contains 2.66 BTC at press time with the latest transaction in September 2019.\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin, the campaign has also been stealing money by altering QIWI wallets, the firm said.\n\nRelated warnings\n\nIn early October, ESET flagged another form of malware stealing crypto from users. Called \u201cCasbaneiro\u201d or \u201cMetamorfo,\u201d the banking trojan targets banks and crypto services located in Brazil and Mexico and has allegedly stolen 1.2 BTC to date.\n\nMeanwhile, Tor Browser users have already been warned about potential money losses due to security breaches. In mid-September, Finnish peer-to-peer crypto exchange LocalBitcoins warned Tor users about the risks of using Tor Browser, claiming that Tor Browser exposes them to the risks of having their Bitcoin stolen.", "description": "Slovakian software security firm ESET has uncovered a fake Tor Browser that steals Bitcoin from darknet shoppers", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMmQ5ZTk3MTUwMDg0MDE5YjMxMDc2MjdkZTVjN2RiNDQuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
