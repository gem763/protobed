The first poll asked Breitbart readers whether they \u201cstand with President Trump,\u201d 97.83 percent of whom said they did, while 2.17 percent said they did not.\n\nThe second poll asked whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) should \u201cresign and be investigated,\u201d to which a whopping 98.4 said he should, while just 1.6 percent said he should not.\n\nIt is not the first time that the NBC show has gone after Breitbart News. In February, actor Don Cheadle appeared on the show donning a hat with a logo for Sleeping Giants, a far-left political activist organization that has launched harassment, blacklist, and boycott campaigns against Breitbart News and other conservative media.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\"\u00a0promoted a \"Breitbart Office Poll\" in which 121 percent of respondents wanted former Vice President Joe Biden impeached over his and his son, Hunter Biden's, dubious dealings in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Image-from-iOS-6-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
