It\u2019s not just about the cute and the cuddly, it\u2019s about everything because everything is necessary. So it\u2019s about snakes it\u2019s about spiders, it\u2019s about cockroaches.\n\n\u2018What I object to on the programme is the ongoing stereotyping of these animals as being things which are dirty, disgusting, poisonous dangerous and so on and so forth. And that\u2019s counter productive to everything that I do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t have wild animals in the circus any more, we don\u2019t like animals being used for that sort of entertainment any more. So why would we countenance it on a TV programme?\n\n\u2018I plan to write them another letter saying, \u201ccan I come and talk to you, can we come up with a solution whereby your programme is no less entertaining and popular and you don\u2019t stereotype and abuse animals?\u201d.\u2019\n\nChris Packham has contacted the show \u2018every year\u2019 about the use of animals (Picture: Lia Toby/WireImage)\n\nHe previously publicly blasted the ITV reality show for \u2018abusing animals\u2019 at the TV Choice Awards last month.\n\nThe 2015 series was hit with 1000 complaints after Ferne McCann ate a live spider during the final.\n\nChris, 58, is fronting the Smart Energy GB campaign to explore the vital role that energy efficiency can play in protecting the environment.\n\nThe campaign aims to help people become more energy efficient by installing a smart meter.\n\nChris feels that people shouldn\u2019t rely on politicians to solve the issue of energy efficient.\n\n\u2018As much as we need government action here I think we need to figure out how to do things ourselves. A lot of people are aware of the climate problems and want to do something but they\u2019ve got to be empowered to do it, and this one of the simplest things,\u2019 he explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018A lot of people think that if we\u2019re gonna achieve our carbon zero by 2050 or 2025 as Extinction Rebellion are demanding, we\u2019ll have to live in a cave and chew carrot. That isn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m excited by the fact we\u2019ve got these new technologies that will allow us to maintain the quality of our lives and improve it while addressing this really very serious issue.\u2019\n\nChris Packham is raising awareness of the #missingpiece and encouraging everyone to act by getting a smart meter installed.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
