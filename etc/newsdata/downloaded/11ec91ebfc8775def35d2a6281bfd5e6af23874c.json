PRECIOUS-Gold rises 1% as risk sentiment sours on trade, Brexit uncertainty\n\n* China-U.S. trade talks on Oct. 10-11\n\n* FOMC minutes due at 1800 GMT Wednesday\n\n* Silver tracks gold, hits over 1-week peak (Updates prices, adds comments and detail)\n\nBy Asha Sistla\n\nOct 8 (Reuters) - Gold rose 1% on Tuesday, bouncing off a one-week low touched earlier in the session, as uncertainties over U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit drove a decline in stock markets and prompted investors to seek refuge in the safe-haven metal.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.7% to $1,503.43 per ounce at 11:27 a.m. EDT (1527 GMT) after rising as much as 1% to $1,508.31 earlier in the session.\n\nU.S. GCcv1 were up 0.3% to $1,509 per ounce.\n\nWall Street tumbled, adding to declines in global stocks, as sentiment soured ahead of high-level trade talks after a report that Washington was moving ahead with efforts to limit capital flows into China and the inclusion of more Chinese firms in a blacklist. MKTS/GLOB\n\n\"There's a possibility the U.S.-China trade talks will stall based on this, that's the reason why there's a small flight into safe-haven products,\" said Phillip Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures.\n\n\"(However) gold is range-bound right now. There's $1,465 to the downside and $1,566 on the upside, we're just stuck in this range.\"\n\nOn the European front, the prospects of an orderly Brexit seemed dim as a British source said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Prime Minister Boris Johnson by phone that a deal was \"overwhelmingly unlikely\". Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are set to resume top-level trade talks on Thursday, ahead of a scheduled increase in U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods on Oct. 15. (gold) got a little bit of downside exposure because there are a lot of people reassessing what happened as they had been too bearish on the economic outlook and current conditions, and they're backing away from that,\" said Jeffrey Christian, managing partner of CPM Group.\n\nWhile gold could see a little bit of a downside in the near-term, it is probably going to head higher because of the global geopolitical uncertainties, Christian added.\n\nInvestors are also awaiting the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee's minutes from its September meeting on Wednesday for clues on whether the central bank will cut rates at its October session.\n\nLower interest rates tend to increase investor interest in non-yielding gold.\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver gained 1.4% to $17.68 an ounce, after touching a high of $17.80 since Sept. 27.\n\nPlatinum rose 0.8% to $883.43, while palladium fell 0.6% to $1,650.05.\n\n\"Silver is getting some benefit from the safe-haven buying and is tracking gold higher,\" RJO Futures' Streible said.", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold rises 1% as risk sentiment sours on trade, Brexit uncertainty", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5N0EK_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
