Depending on how the House proceeds, this raises the possibility of a Senate trial just as the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses are set to begin in early 2020 -- though Trump still enjoys broad support among Senate Republicans and would have to suffer enormous party defections to actually be ousted from office.\n\nEarlier this year, McConnell gave a similar assessment to NPR, saying that if impeachment \u201cwere to happen, the Senate has no choice. If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes to trial.\u201d\n\nBut last week, before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the formal impeachment inquiry in the House, McConnell said he was \u201cnot going to address all of these\u2026hypotheticals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think all of that is premature,\u201d he said.\n\nTHE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: HOW DOES REMOVING A PRESIDENT WORK?\n\nMcConnell has now cleared the air on the heels of Pelosi's launch of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe timetable for House action remains unclear, though Democrat-led committees are moving quickly to investigate allegations, first raised in a whistleblower complaint, that Trump improperly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. A transcript of that call shows Trump sought an investigation, but he denies wrongdoing and denies tying the request to U.S. aid.\n\nHouse Democrats, including Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., have vowed to work expeditiously on the inquiry, with some reports indicating that Democrats could even be prepared to introduce formal articles of impeachment against Trump later this fall.\n\nShould the House introduce articles of impeachment, all that is needed to impeach Trump is a simple majority vote by those lawmakers present and voting. But at that point, removal from the Oval Office is hardly a certainty. The Senate, as McConnell indicated, would have to hold a \"trial.\"\n\nDuring such a trial, House lawmakers serve as so-called \u201cmanagers,\u201d who basically fill the role that prosecutors would in a criminal trial and present evidence against the president. The president would be represented by his own counsel.\n\nThe chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial and the Senate acts as the jury \u2013 listening to the arguments from both sides before deliberating and voting on whether to remove the president from office.\n\nBut it takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove him from office.\n\nWhile some Senate Republicans have voiced concerns about Trump's actions, impeachment does not at this stage appear to have enough support in the Senate to threaten Trump in the long run. Most GOP senators have stopped short of condemning the president for his controversial phone call, while others have outright defended him.\n\n\u201cThis seems to me like a political setup,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s all hearsay. You can\u2019t get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay. The whistleblower didn\u2019t hear the phone call.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower acknowledged that the complaint was based on second-hand information.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nLast week, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire called the accusations in the complaint \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\nFox News' Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that he would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to take up articles of impeachment against President Trump should the House of Representatives approve them following their formal impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
