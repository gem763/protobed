Stand with Hong Kong\" earlier this month.\n\nChinese companies suspended ties with the Rockets in response. China is a major revenue source for the league, and players and league officials largely avoided backing Morey in what was viewed as an effort to appease Beijing.\n\nPence's comments \u2014 which came in the middle of a speech that was largely critical of China's economic and human rights abuses \u2014 echoed the response from lawmakers in both parties who have taken out their ire on the NBA rather than China.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver has been adamant that the league would not compromise its values to appease Beijing, but the league response has largely been overshadowed by comments from some of its most vocal players and coaches.\n\nLeBron James, the league's most prominent player and an outspoken advocate for social justice issues in the U.S., said he thought Morey may not have been educated on the issue.\n\nGolden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, a typically outspoken critic of President Trump Donald John TrumpSchedule for additional depositions in impeachment inquiry revealed Sondland attorney disputes key portions of Taylor testimony: report Impeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report MORE, has largely avoided discussing the issue.\n\nPence in his speech touted the Trump administration's support for Hong Kong protesters.\n\n\u201cTo the millions in Hong Kong who have been peacefully protesting to protect your rights these past months: We stand with you,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe are inspired by you. And we urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest.\u201d\n\nBut human rights advocates and some lawmakers have said Trump could do more to speak out against Beijing's crackdown on protesters.\n\nCNN reported that Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping during a June phone call that he would not be vocal about the Hong Kong protests during ongoing trade negotiations.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he hopes the two sides can reach a humane solution amid escalating tensions but has avoided directly criticizing Beijing. Earlier this month, the president praised the Hong Kong protesters for their \"tremendous signage\" and suggested a new partial trade agreement with China would aid the protesters.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s going to take care of itself,\u201d Trump said of the dispute. \u201cI actually think this deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened. I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong.\"", "description": "Vice President Pence on Thursday hammered the NBA and Nike for their handling of the controversy surrounding a\u00a0Houston Rockets executive's tweet supporting Hong Kong protesters, accusing the companies of ignoring human rights abuses in China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pencemike_101619upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
