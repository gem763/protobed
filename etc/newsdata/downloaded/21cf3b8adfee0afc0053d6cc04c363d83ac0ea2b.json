The government would have targeted the payment providers of websites that did not comply with the law.\n\nDelingpole: UK Conservative Government Wants Tougher Internet Rules than North Korea.

Another perceived flaw in the legislation was that sites like Twitter and Reddit, which also host pornographic material, would not have been covered in the bill.\n\nDigital Secretary Nicky Morgan in a written statement on Wednesday said that the government would not be \u201ccommencing\u201d with the age restriction portion of the 2017 Digital Economy Act.\n\nShe went on to say that: \u201cAdult content is too easily accessed online and more needs to be done to protect children from harm\u2026this includes age verification tools and we expect them to continue to play a key role in protecting children online.\u201d\n\nThe government alluded to a \u201cduty of care\u201d that pornography purveyors would have to abide by, but did not give specific details on what that would entail.\n\nA 2016 NSPCC study linking pornography with developmental damage in children found that nearly 50 per cent of children between the ages of 11 to 16 had viewed pornography on the internet. Of those children, 28 per cent had viewed the porn accidentally, while 19 per cent had intentionally searched for it.", "description": "The government of the United Kingdom has dropped a controversial plan to enact strict age restrictions on porn sites.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/child-with-tablet-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
