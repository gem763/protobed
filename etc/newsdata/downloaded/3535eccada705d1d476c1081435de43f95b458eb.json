The user can then either block that app or authorize the use of data.\n\nRead more here.\n\nWRITE ALL ABOUT IT: The Save Journalism Project, an advocacy group that works to expose how tech companies have harmed the journalism industry, on Tuesday told The Hill it is launching an effort to fund freelance stories about Big Tech's effect on vulnerable communities.\n\nThe group is aiming to raise $10,000 through Kickstarter. That initial amount would fund five stories, and the Save Journalism Project plans to continue fundraising after hitting that goal.\n\n\"One of the biggest challenges with freelancing is funding the travel, the research, and the time it takes to write the story, all before you can even pitch it \u2013 especially for journalists suddenly laid off and adhering to an unexpected budget,\" John Stanton, a co-founder of the Save Journalism Project and former D.C. bureau chief of BuzzFeed News, said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n\"With this Kickstarter funding, freelancers will have the means to follow the lede, get the story, and educate readers before big tech's death grip decimates journalism completely,\" Stanton, who was laid off in January, added.\n\nThe advocacy group was founded by two journalists, both of whom were laid off in recent months, to bring attention to how tech platforms' stranglehold on digital advertising revenue harms local and online news publishers.\n\nSince launching in June, the group has funded a round of advertisements raising awareness about the issue and compiled resources for beleaguered journalists struggling with mental health issues.\n\nRead more here.\n\nALL THE SPACE LADIES: NASA has pushed its planned first all-female spacewalk up at least three days, after a power system failure at the International Space Station, according to The Associated Press.\n\nUnder the revised schedule, astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch will conduct the spacewalk Thursday or Friday to deal with the problem, rather than Monday as originally planned, according to the AP.\n\nThe power failure involved a critical battery power controller, which the astronauts will now replace entirely rather than installing new batteries as first planned.\n\nNASA scheduled its first all-woman spacewalk last spring, but had to reschedule due to a shortage of medium-sized space suits, according to the AP.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTIKTOK BRINGS ON THE LAWMAKERS: Social media app TikTok on Tuesday announced the hire of two former lawmakers for its team that develops content moderation policies.\n\nFormer Reps.
