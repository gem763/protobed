His strict security made it impossible to communicate with supporters, aside from his sporadic and brief audio messages.", "description": "The death of Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi came as a shock to his followers on Sunday, but not a surprise.", "authors": ["Josie Ensor", "Norman Tebbit", "Asa Bennett", "Henry Smith", "John Longworth"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/cRLIHqlJXNs/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
