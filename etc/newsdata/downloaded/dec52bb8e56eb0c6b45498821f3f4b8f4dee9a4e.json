Initial investigations have revealed that the Martinique-born man, a convert to Islam, had had contacts with individuals who are likely to belong to an Islamist Salafist movement.\n\nLe Parisien reported on its website that a USB memory device found in the assailant's house had personal details about several dozens of his colleagues at police headquarters, as well as several Islamic State propaganda videos.\n\nThe paper added that it was not clear whether the attacker had shared that information with others.\n\nAuthorities fear that police officers' lives could be at risk if details about their identities or addresses fall in the wrong hands.\n\nPolice sources could not immediately comment on the paper's report.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told a weekly on Sunday that he had ordered inspectors to review procedures in the intelligence department of the police headquarters and anti-terror intelligence unit to detect signs of radicalisation among civil servants.
