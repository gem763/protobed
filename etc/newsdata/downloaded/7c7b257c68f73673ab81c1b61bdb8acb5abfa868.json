The conversation was always around what were the strategic implications. Would that money get to the right place or would there be corruption in Ukraine and the money wouldn\u2019t flow to the mission that it was intended for. How do we protect that. Is it appropriate for us to provide defensive weapons?\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t know why Barack Obama held up that funding. Maybe he had a theory too. I don\u2019t know. He never provided it. This administration has done it not once, not twice but now three times.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "Sunday on ABC's \"This Week,\"\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he never saw a quid pro quo being pursued by the Trump administration in regards to the | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Secretary-Of-State-Mike-Pompeo-Holds-Press-Conference-At-State-Department-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
