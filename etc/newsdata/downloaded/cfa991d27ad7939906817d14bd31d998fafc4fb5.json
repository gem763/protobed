According to online tech news outlet The Information, ByteDance revenue for the whole of 2018 was $7.2 billion.\n\nByteDance declined to comment.\n\nThe seven-year-old startup, which separate sources have said was valued at $78 billion late last year, also owns Chinese news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, meaning \"Today\u2019s Headlines\", as well as a domestic version of TikTok, known as Douyin.\n\nMost of the company's revenue is garnered in China, the second person familiar with the matter said, adding that while Douyin generates advertising fees, TikTok is still in the early stages of making money.\n\nAnalysts have called ByteDance a strong threat to other Chinese tech industry firms including social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd and search engine leader Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: ). Globally, ByteDance's apps have 1.5 billion monthly active users and 700 million daily active users, the company said in July.\n\nLast month it launched a search engine that sits within Toutiao, putting it in direct competition with Baidu. It has also acquired a Chinese-language Wikipedia-like website called Baike.com to further boost content.\n\nAiming to expand in markets outside China, ByteDance recently launched work efficiency app Lark and is planning to launch a paid music-streaming app.\n\nIts aggressive push into new areas has helped lift global headcount to around 50,000 currently, compared with 40,000 last year.", "description": "Exclusive: TikTok owner ByteDance's H1 revenue better than expected at over $7 billion - sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8T09Y_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
