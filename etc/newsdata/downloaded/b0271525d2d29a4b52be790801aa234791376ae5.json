That is the main thing for us,\u201d said Ushakov.\n\nTENSIONS\n\nAsked earlier if Turkey\u2019s actions squared with Moscow\u2019s desire for Syria\u2019s territorial integrity to be restored and respected, he said: \u201cNot exactly.\u201d\n\nUshakov, speaking in Riyadh during a visit to Saudi Arabia by Putin, added that Russia planned to \u201cdo something\u201d without specifying what that might be.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s spokesman, said Russia did not want to entertain the possibility of a clash in Syria between Russian and Turkish forces. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even like to think about that scenario,\u201d Peskov told reporters.\n\nPeskov said Moscow had already warned all sides in the Syrian conflict to avoid any action that could escalate tensions in the area or damage a fragile political process.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said earlier on Monday that he did not envisage any problems would emerge in Syria\u2019s Kobani after the Syrian army deploys along the border.\n\nErdogan spoke of what he called Putin\u2019s \u201cpositive approach\u201d to Turkey\u2019s actions.\n\nThe Kremlin has said previously it is sympathetic to Ankara\u2019s need to address security concerns in northern Syria. But Peskov declined to comment on Monday when asked if Moscow felt it was time for Turkey to end its operation inside Syria.\n\nHe said Moscow was in regular contact with Ankara, including at a military level. Hours later, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigiu spoke to his Turkish counterpart.\n\nValery Gerasimov, the head of Russian\u2019s military general staff, on Monday also conducted phone negotiations with U.S. Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Russian news agencies reported.", "description": "The Kremlin complained on Monday that Turkey's incursion into northern Syria was \"not exactly\" compatible with Syrian territorial integrity, and Ankara should ensure its actions were proportionate.", "authors": ["Olesya Astakhova", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
