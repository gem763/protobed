(Picture: Syco/ITV)\n\nBritain\u2019s Got Talent returns tomorrow (31 August) but with a new format that will see champions from previous years battle it out for the ultimate title.\n\nViewers will once again be treated to the talents of Paul Potts, the first-ever winner, Boogie Storm, The Sacred Riana (the most watched act to date), Bad Salsa, The Nelson Twins and many more.\n\nConnie Talbot, 18, who was just six years old when she performed Somewhere Over The Rainbow, will also be back \u2013 but with an original song this time.\n\nThe show will run for six weeks, and each week the judging panel, comprised of Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams, will choose one act that they would like to see in the final.\n\nBut the public has power too, and will be able to choose a second act.\n\nWhat does the winner of Britain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions get?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Britain\u2019s Got Talent have returned, but what will they walk away with if they win?\n\nOriginally, the winners of Britain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions were set to receive \u00a350,000, but that quickly changed when Simon Cowell discovered the sum of money up for grabs.\n\nThe music mogul, 59, apparently offered to double the prize money for the returning contestants, boosting the prize fund from \u00a350,000 to a very generous \u00a3100,000 during the recording of the first show.\n\nReports suggested that Simon overheard host Ant McPartlin talking about the prize money before suddenly interjecting: \u2018Did you just say fifty grand? That\u2019s it?\u2019\n\nAccording to reports, Ant replied: \u2018That\u2019s it. Unless you want to double it. Do you want to double it?\u2019\n\nThe live audience cheered, prompting Simon to spontaneously respond: \u2018Yes, I will. It\u2019s a hundred grand everybody,\u2019 prompting rapturous applause from the crowd.\n\nThe doubling of the prize money will come as welcome news to Australian act The Nelson Twins who had originally joked that the \u00a350k prize money would only just about cover their costs for appearing on the show after they had, \u2018blown their life savings on a sandwich in Covent Garden.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s a feeling we can all relate to right there.\n\nWhen is the final of Britain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions?\n\nThe Nelson Brothers are back (Picture: Syco/Thames)\n\nThe official date for the final is yet to be confirmed, but it is expected to take place on Saturday 5 October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, we do know that it won\u2019t be shown live. The show was filmed earlier this year and the winner has already been chosen.\n\nThere are rumours as to who took home the trophy, but let\u2019s not spoil the fun.\n\nBritain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions will air tomorrow at 8pm.\n\nMORE: Paul Potts\u2019 victory on Britain\u2019s Got Talent was down to a coin flip\n\nMORE: Amanda Holden confirms Britain\u2019s Got Talent performance after landing massive \u00a31 million record deal\n\nMORE: Britain\u2019s Got Talent\u2019s Connie Talbot is unrecognisable as she returns 12 years after first audition", "description": "ITV's talent show returns with a twist, as former winners like Connie Talbot, The Nelson Twins, Boogie Storm and Paul Potts battle it out.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PRC_81721119_1567266821.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-08-31"}
