(Biden also released a 11-page labor plan on October 25, which discusses gig workers rights.) Asked if Biden supports the upcoming Uber protests, his national press secretary Jamal Brown told Motherboard that Biden \u201cfirmly stands with Uber drivers as they organize to receive the pay, legal benefits and workplace protections they deserve.\u201d\n\nPressed further about the protests at billionaires\u2019 homes, Biden\u2019s press secretary would not give a straight \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer on whether he will support the Uber drivers. (In June, Biden told a crowd of wealthy potential donors at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City that he would not \u201cdemonize the wealthy,\u201d and that \u201cno one\u2019s standard of living will change,\u201d if he wins the presidency.)\n\nUber activist drivers selected November 6 to protest because it marks the first time early Uber investors, including billionaires Bill Gurley and Garrett Camp, will be able to cash out since the company went public in May. At the time of its initial public offering, Camp\u2019s Uber investment had been valued at $3.2 billion, while Gurley\u2019s stock was worth an estimated $600 million.\n\n\u201cCompanies should not be able to misclassify workers as independent contractors in order to skirt labor laws,\u201d Biden's press secretary added. He said that as president, Biden would work to enact federal legislation similar to AB5, a new California law that will reclassify gig workers as employees, to \u201censure workers in the gig economy and beyond can share in the prosperity their work has created.\u201d\n\nThe statement marks the furthest that Biden has come out in support of the law, which will go into effect on January 1. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and even Kamala Harris, whose brother-in-law Tony West serves as Uber\u2019s chief legal counsel, announced support for the law months ago. In other words, Biden\u2019s campaign is caving under pressure to support gig workers rights, as labor issues increasingly become a litmus test for 2020 candidates. His statement arrives on the same day as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash announce a 2020 California ballot measure to challenge AB5, pledging $100 million to turn back a law that would provide gig workers with basic labor protections, including the right to unionize, overtime pay, and worker\u2019s compensation.\n\nThis election cycle, candidates are actually competing to win the vote of labor activists and unions. Sanders and Warren have led the pack in supporting unions and showing up on picket lines, pushing other candidates further to the left on labor issues.\n\nSince Motherboard reached out late last week, Elizabeth Warren tweeted out her support for the Uber demonstrations, and Andrew Yang\u2019s campaign said that he \u201csupports the protesters.\u201d\n\nLike Biden, Buttigieg\u2019s press secretary Nina Smith remained ambiguous as to whether the South Bend mayor supports the protest. \u201cPete knows something is wrong with the economy when the stock market is going up but you need two or three or even more jobs just to make ends meets. One job should be enough,\u201d she said. In late August, Buttigieg, to the surprise of many, joined the chorus of protestors at Uber\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco, calling for their recognition as employees.\n\nKamala Harris and Cory Booker\u2019s campaigns did not respond to Motherboard\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nOn November 6, Uber drivers will show up in their cars at Gurley and Camp\u2019s homes, as well as Google\u2019s free event space in San Francisco, where they will protest Google Ventures, the venture capital branch of Google\u2019s parent company, which had estimated $5.2 billion in Uber shares as of May. They hope to highlight the differences between Uber\u2019s stakeholders, who have reaped billions in profits, and the company\u2019s labor force, which isn\u2019t guaranteed a minimum wage.\n\nGig Workers Rising, the Bay Area gig workers organization leading the protest, says it received a call from an officer at the police department in Atherton, the affluent San Francisco peninsula town where Bill Gurley resides after it announced the upcoming protest. The officer expressed concerns about demonstrations in such a \u201chigh wealth area,\u201d the group said. (Last year, Atherton boasted the most expensive zip code in the United States.)\n\nAtherton\u2019s police commander, Joe Wade, told Motherboard that he was not aware of any of his officers making such a call, but that he was personally concerned about an Uber protest occurring down the street from Sacred Heart, a private Catholic school.\n\nOrganizers at Gig Workers Rising say that a fourth action could be staged in New York City.", "description": "Motherboard asked the 2020 democratic frontrunners if they support next week\u2019s Uber protests.
