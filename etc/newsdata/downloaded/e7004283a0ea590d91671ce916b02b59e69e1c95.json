The White Sox ended a season-high seven-game losing streak.\n\nThe crowd of 17,397 came to its feet when Carrasco ran through the bullpen gate and chanted \u201cCookie\u201d - the right-hander\u2019s nickname.\n\nCarrasco (4-7) entered the game after Roberto P\u00e9rez\u2019s three-homer in the seventh gave Cleveland a 5-2 lead. Carrasco gave up singles to Leury Garc\u00eda and Tim Anderson, but struck out Jos\u00e9 Abreu and Yo\u00e1n Moncada.\n\nWith the fans on their feet again, McCann startled the crowd by homering into the bleachers to tie the game. Jim\u00e9nez followed with a towering drive to right that cleared the wall despite a leaping attempt by Yasiel Puig.\n\nThe inning finally ended when Carrasco fielded Daniel Palka\u2019s high chopper and ran to first for the out. He was given another ovation when he left the field.\n\nIndians manager Terry Francona said he wanted to use Carrasco in low-pressure situations as he returned, but Cleveland needed five relievers in Monday night\u2019s 11-3 win.\n\nCarrasco, diagnosed with a treatable form of leukemia in June, pitched an inning in Tampa Bay on Sunday. Carrasco said on Monday that his whole body was shaking when he on the field, but he knew his first appearance at home would be even more emotional.\n\nJim\u00e9nez had an RBI double in the second and a solo homer in the seventh off Mike Clevinger. The rookie left fielder recorded his fourth career two-homer game.\n\nEvan Marshall (4-2) got the win despite allowing P\u00e9rez\u2019s home run. Alex Colom\u00e9 survived Franmil Reyes\u2019 flyout to deep right in the ninth for his 26th save.\n\nFrancisco Lindor homered in the first. Jim\u00e9nez tied the game in the second with an RBI double. P\u00e9rez broke the tie with an RBI single in the fifth, but Jim\u00e9nez homered in the seventh.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nWhite Sox: LHP Manny Ba\u00f1uelos sustained a bruised foot when he was struck by a groundball in the eighth inning Monday.\n\nIndians: RHP Danny Salazar (sore shoulder and groin) returned to his home in Tampa. Francona said Salazar experienced some physical issues while on a minor league rehab assignment and asked for some time away. Salazar made one appearance for Cleveland last month before going back on the injured list.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWhite Sox: RHP Iv\u00e1n Nova (9-11, 4.48 ERA) has been dominant in his last eight starts, going 5-2 and allowing nine earned runs in 52 innings.\n\nIndians: RHP Shane Bieber (12-7, 3.27 ERA) has lost his last three decisions. The All-Star Game MVP hasn\u2019t won since Aug. 9.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carlos Carrasco received a standing ovation in his first appearance at Progressive Field since being diagnosed with leukemia, but gave up home runs to James McCann and Eloy Jim\u00e9nez in the eighth inning that lifted the Chicago White Sox over the Cleveland Indians 6-5 Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Herrick"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/white_sox_indians_baseball_57889_c0-166-3972-2481_s1770x1032.jpg?1a922d9c02096d86e0f3e2f1d8224f52ea41989e"}
