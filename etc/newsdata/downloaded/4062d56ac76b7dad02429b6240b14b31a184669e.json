(Oct. 28) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Pentagon released details and graphic footage Wednesday of the secret raid that killed ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi over the weekend.\n\nMarine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the four-star chief of Central Command who oversaw the operation, said the raid on Oct. 25 killed six ISIS fighters, including Bagdhadi.\n\nMcKenzie described a fast, lethal strike in which militants from groups not related to Baghdadi were also killed. No U.S. commandos were wounded in the raid.

(Photo: Department of Defense)\n\nOn Friday, McKenzie briefed President Trump on the risks involved in the raid.\n\nThe operation began about 9 a.m. ET Saturday, on McKenzie's order from his headquarters in Tampa, he said. He remained in contact with the White House throughout the raid.\n\nThe American commandos took off from a base in Syria for the hourlong flight to Baghdadi's isolated, walled compound about four miles from the Turkish border in Idlib province in northwest Syria, McKenzie said.\n\nInsurgents in the area fired on the aircraft and were killed by gunfire from the helicopters. Black-and-white footage released by the Pentagon shows dark forms eliminated in a cloud of dust kicked up by the airstrike.\n\nThe Pentagon's most advanced fighter jets and drones hovered overhead as the special operations force blew holes in the walls of the compound and encountered five ISIS members \u2013 four women and one man.\n\nMcKenzie said they displayed \"hostile intent\" and were wearing suicide vests. They did not respond to commands in Arabic or warning shots, he said, and were gunned down. Eleven children were rescued.\n\nBaghdadi then crawled into a hole with two young children under the age of 12 and detonated his suicide vest, killing all of them, McKenzie said.\n\nIn announcing Baghdadi's death Sunday morning, President Trump described him as whimpering and crying before his death, but McKenzie said he had no information about Baghdadi's actions immediately prior to the explosion.\n\nAfter gathering intelligence from the compound, U.S. troops departed with two detainees, McKenzie said. A precision airstrike reduced the structure to rubble.\n\n\"It looks pretty much like a parking lot with large potholes,\" McKenzie said.\n\nBaghdadi's remains were buried at sea, he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted a photo of this dog, saying \"We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!\" (Photo: President Donald Trump/Twitter)\n\nThe operation had been planned for some time and had been informed by intelligence gathered by military and intelligence agencies, as well as the Syrian Democratic Forces, key partners of the U.S.-led coalition that had rolled back virtually all of the territorial gains made by ISIS since 2014.\n\nOn Oct. 6, Trump announced that U.S. troops would withdraw from Syria, allowing Turkey to begin operations against the Kurds, whom they consider terrorists. That prompted bipartisan outrage on Capitol Hill as the abandonment of a key U.S. ally.\n\nOn Wednesday, McKenzie said the withdrawal had no effect on the planning or timing of the raid, which he said was entirely chosen by U.S. commanders.\n\nThe dog, a Belgian Malinois, has captured headlines and Trump's attention in recent days. McKenzie described the dog as a \"fine canine,\" a four-year member of special operations forces and veteran of 50 combat missions.\n\nThe successful mission does not end the threat from ISIS, he said.\n\n\"We don't see a bloodless future,\" McKenzie said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/30/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-raid-pentagon-releases-photos-videos/4103564002/", "description": "The general who oversaw the operation said the raid killed six ISIS fighters, including Bagdhadi.", "authors": ["Tom Vanden Brook", "Published P.M.
