The stories come from real life, real people's families,\" she shared. \"It\u2019s amazing that, I think a lot of people, especially with my character and Haley and Luke and Manny, have grown up with us -- these young kids that are now our age.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s a beautiful thing to talk to people my age about how the show has impacted them and how my character has you know made it \"cool\" to enjoy school and stuff like that,\" she continued. \"I\u2019ve always enjoyed school and I\u2019ve always thought it was cool, but it\u2019s a beautiful thing to see so many different things that are being accepted because of our show.\"\n\n\"While this is a small impact on the entire world, it means a lot to us because that\u2019s really what we want this show to be,\" she added.\n\nLooking back on some of the best moments on set\n\nThe cast and crew obviously have plenty of lasting memories from years filming the show since it premiered in 2009. Some of Winter's favorites are from the cast's trip to Australia for season five's episode 20.\n\n\"I like when we get to go on trips together because it\u2019s something new, and it\u2019s something fun that we can all explore together -- time that we spend not just on the set,\" she explained.\n\n\u201c \u201d What I hope is that when people watch our show, they can see themselves somewhere.\n\n\"On the set we're there to work, and I see people outside the set, but when we\u2019re on location somewhere, like when we went to Australia, everyone\u2019s getting together after your work day.\"\n\nShe said that she will also always value just the ordinary, everyday time spent with her castmates. \"Just growing up with them -- it would be hard to pick just a couple of the amazing experiences I\u2019ve had because it\u2019s been 10, almost 11 years,\" she shared. \"There\u2019s been so many along the line.\"\n\nOn the close relationships formed through the show\n\nThe actress explained that the group clicked from the very beginning. \"We became this family,\" she said.\n\n\"I know a lot of people work together and it doesn\u2019t happen for them...but for us we all really liked each other from the beginning. There was good chemistry between us,\" she continued.\n\nWinter said she's especially close with co-star Nolan Gould, who plays her sibling, Luke Dunphy, on the show.\n\n\"He is, in my mind, 100% my brother,\" she shared. \"I love Nolan to pieces because we grew up together ... just growing pains of being teenagers and kids and being so close in age, being able to relate to each other -- and Rico -- that\u2019s been a beautiful thing for us.\n\n\u201c \u201d I think I was, through Alex, able to inspire other people to believe in education.\n\n\"When you have that chemistry with the people you work with -- and you\u2019re lucky enough to be employed -- it doesn\u2019t really feel like work anymore, it just happens organically,\" she added.\n\nShe also said the show's crew is \"so amazing.\" \"I think I\u2019ll have a hard time not spending as much time in my days with them.\"\n\nWhat she's learned through Alex Dunphy\n\nThe actress says one of the things she loved most about her character is her interest in education.\n\n\"I never thought of that stigma in the way -- that being smart is uncool or that you couldn\u2019t be pretty and smart, or funny and smart or social and smart,\" she said.\n\n\"Growing up playing her, she was going through a lot of the same things I was going through,\" she added. \"I think I was, through Alex, able to inspire other people to believe in education. Believe in themselves really.\"\n\nTony Rivetti/Walt Disney Television via Getty\n\nAlthough her character graduated from college in the series, Winter has her own take on whether or not the form of education is necessary.\n\n\"You\u2019re not a failure if you don\u2019t go to college,\" she said. \"It\u2019s just having knowledge, it\u2019s nice to learn about things that you\u2019re really interested in ... the thing I\u2019ve pushed is just to always keep learning and always just push yourself in that way, and that\u2019s something that Alex does.\"\n\nLife after 'Modern Family'\n\nThe actress hasn't ventured into many on-screen projects outside of her work in TV. She starred in the 2017 drama \"The Last Movie Star\" with Burt Reynolds but says she would love to do more work in film.\n\n\"I have always loved the idea of doing movies -- and I\u2019ve done a couple -- but I\u2019d like to do more and play different characters,\" she said. \"With movies it\u2019s a shorter span of time that you\u2019re doing something, so you get to play many different characters all the time \u2026 and I think that\u2019s really cool.\"\n\nHowever, she doesn't root out finding another lasting project on television.\n\n\"If an amazing show came along and I was lucky enough to be picked for it, I would be very grateful,\" she said. \"There\u2019s nothing that I would really say no to if it was a great opportunity.\"\n\nThe final season of \"Modern Family\" premieres on Wednesday, September 25 at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.", "description": "To celebrate the new season premiere tonight, Winter shared what she's learned through playing Alex Dunphy.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ariel-winter-abc-jt-190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
