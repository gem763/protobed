REUTERS/Jose Torres\n\nNow, the agency fears the burden on employees already working up to 15 hours a day will increase after the U.S. Supreme Court decided to restore a Trump administration policy banning most asylum applications at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nLike many others in Tapachula, a gateway city between Guatemala and Mexico, Danny Perez, a 29-year-old Honduran taxi driver who said he fled to escape extortion by gangs, dreamed of reaching the United States. But as the reality of Trump\u2019s immigration policies sets in, he is trying to settle in Mexico.\n\nPerez cannot work without papers while his claim is being processed, and he has no money to rent a room.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Perez, who began the process of seeking asylum last week and worries he may go \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nResigned to waiting, he spends his nights on a patch of sidewalk across the street from the refugee office in Tapachula, where he feels safe amid the steady churn of migrants, trying to snatch a few hours of sleep under the street lamps\u2019 neon glow.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Supreme Court action, which reinstated a U.S. policy stipulating that migrants crossing another country en route to the United States must apply for asylum in that country, will likely exacerbate the demand in Mexico, said Andres Ramirez, head of the Mexican refugee agency, COMAR.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worrying,\u201d Ramirez told Reuters. \u201cWe expect this will add to the growing numbers we\u2019ve been seeing.\u201d\n\nAlexander Espinoza waited half a year. His life once revolved around making it to U.S. soil: The 33-year-old Salvadoran says he tried to enter illegally 10 times, including six attempts in six months. But as Trump ratcheted up his anti-immigration rhetoric, Espinoza decided to call Mexico home.\n\nLast week, COMAR recognised him as a refugee, ending a wait that began in March. He faces more delay for his residency card. But he was not downhearted, showing off the braided bracelets he has made, his fledgling business.\n\n15 HOURS\n\nEven before Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court action, applications at COMAR were expected to hit 80,000 in 2019, more than double last year\u2019s total. In August alone, requests more than tripled from last year to 8,178.\n\nOn Friday morning in Tapachula a few dozen asylum-seekers waited for their appointments, armed with colourful plastic folders carrying the paperwork that will determine their fate.\n\nSitting at a desk stacked high with manila case folders, Claudia Briseno said COMAR employees like her have been working at a gruelling pace. The office\u2019s 63 employees are processing 16,350 applications \u2013 or about 260 per person.\n\nDays stretching 10, 12 or even 15 hours are the norm, Briseno said, her voice cracking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making triple the effort so we can give everyone access to the refugee system,\u201d she said.\n\nThe staff has streamlined processes, reducing the frequency with which asylum-seekers must report in, Briseno said. But the latest change in U.S. immigration policy may upend that progress.\n\nThe agency\u2019s shoestring budget compounds its problems. COMAR received federal funding of 20 million pesos ($1 million) in 2019, the lowest sum in seven years. The proposed 2020 budget would increase it to 27 million pesos \u2013 still far short of the 117 million pesos COMAR chief Ramirez says the agency needs.\n\nCOMAR leans heavily on the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency, which has provided 112 staff and helped open three new offices.\n\nBut until COMAR is better funded, migrants will be short of support to rebuild their lives in Mexico, said Enrique Vidal, coordinator for human rights group Fray Matias de Cordova.\n\n\u201cCOMAR lacks, on a structural level, the capacity to attend to the reality we\u2019re living in,\u201d he said.\n\nNEXT STOP, USA\n\nFor some, asylum in Mexico is simply a stop on the road. Under the U.S. policy reinstated by the Supreme Court, migrants may still have a shot at U.S. asylum if their application is rejected in another country.\n\nRoger Fuentes, a Cuban home goods vendor who arrived in Tapachula in August, said the United States remains his goal.\n\n\u201cYou have to request (asylum in Mexico) or you won\u2019t have other options,\u201d said Fuentes, 34.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nHe said he will not try to throw his Mexican asylum case, though he knows that rejection could help his U.S. bid.\n\nSimilarly, Teresa Cardonell said fear of deportation back to Cuba has made her determined to do everything right in Mexico \u2013 including applying for asylum. But her mind is fixed on the United States. Terrified after being robbed in Tapachula, she dyed her blonde locks brown to try to blend in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeking freedom,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cIn Mexico, I\u2019m still not free \u2013 I can\u2019t go out.\u201d", "description": "Mexico's tiny asylum agency is already overwhelmed with applicants who are abandoning the American dream because of U.S. President Donald Trump's hardline immigration measures.", "authors": ["Julia Love", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430435282&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0SK", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
