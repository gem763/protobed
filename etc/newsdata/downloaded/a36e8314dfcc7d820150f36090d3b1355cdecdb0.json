Joe Kennedy Joseph (Joe) Patrick KennedyFlight attendant union endorses Markey in Senate primary battle Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle mourn Cummings Ocasio-Cortez taps supporters for donations as former primary opponent pitches for Kennedy MORE III (D-Mass.) in a tense exchange Wednesday pressed the head of the Medicare and Medicaid programs to explain why she has allowed states to impose work requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nKennedy asked Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to point to any study that backs up the administration\u2019s argument that work requirements make people healthier.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHealthier people might work, work doesn\u2019t necessarily make people healthier,\u201d Kennedy, who is running a primary campaign to unseat Sen. Edward Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyDemocrats offer cybersecurity bill for 'internet of things' Democrats introduce SWAMP Act to ban meetings with foreign leaders at Trump properties Flight attendant union endorses Markey in Senate primary battle MORE (D-Mass.), said. \u201cYou are imposing policies on millions of people across this country. Can you show me one study that says that is a good policy?\u201d\n\nWork requirements are a central feature of the Trump administration\u2019s vision to transform the Medicaid program. Officials argue that work requirements are a pathway out of poverty, and provide an incentive for people to work.\n\nUnder ObamaCare, states were given the option to expand Medicaid to childless low-income adults who didn\u2019t previously qualify for the program.\n\nThe Trump administration says that \u201cable-bodied\u201d adults should work instead and that Medicaid should be reserved for children, people who are pregnant, adults who are disabled and very-low-income residents.\n\nThe Trump administration has approved work requirements in 10 states to date, and seven more are awaiting approval.\n\nIn Arkansas, 18,000 people lost Medicaid coverage as a result of the state's work requirements before they were struck down by a federal judge.\n\nKennedy asked Verma if she considers it a \u201csuccess\u201d that so many people have lost their healthcare.\n\n\u201cI think it's premature to draw conclusions about Arkansas\u2019s program. The program was in effect for 10 months,\u201d Verma said.\n\n\u201c18,000 people lost their health care. How many more people have to lose their health care before you can make a determination?\u201d Kennedy responded incredulously.", "description": "Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/kennedyiiijoe_112918gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
