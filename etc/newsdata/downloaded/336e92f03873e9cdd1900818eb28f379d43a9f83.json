California recently passed legislation designed to pave the way for so-called \u201cgig workers\u201d to become employees and gain additional rights, which is expected to increase costs for firms such as Uber.\n\n'Vetted and qualified' workers\n\nMillions of American workers use staffing agencies, Uber said in a blog post announcing the venture. But it believes the process can be made more transparent and faster for both employees and firms.\n\nThe app will provide information on pay, location and working conditions. Workers can also use it to track working hours and breaks, the firm said.\n\nEmployers would be able to tap into a ready pool of \"vetted and qualified\" temporary labour, Uber said.\n\nUber will focus on making the app successful in Chicago, where it has already operated in a test phase for the past year, before introducing it elsewhere, it added.\n\nThe growth of casual hiring, dubbed the \"gig economy\", has been controversial. Some staff hired on an ad hoc basis say they appreciate the flexibility it offers, while others suffer income insecurity and a lack of other welfare benefits of employee status.\n\nDrivers working for Uber's original ride-hailing business have taken the company to court to establish the firm's duty to provide staff benefits such as holiday pay and sickness cover.\n\nUber Works has agreed partnerships with staffing agencies in Chicago that employ, pay and handle worker benefits, potentially side-stepping this issue with the new platform.", "description": "Starting in Chicago, Uber Works will allow casual workers to compare pay rates and sign up for shifts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1926/production/_109083460_gettyimages-1160805945.jpg"}
