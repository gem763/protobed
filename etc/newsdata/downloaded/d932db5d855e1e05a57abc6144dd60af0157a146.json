Oumarou Namatou Gazama. He blamed \"the terrorist group\" Ansarul Islam.\n\nMali's government said that after exchanges of gunfire, the army had retaken Boulikessi, killing at least 15 extremists and destroying five of their vehicles. It said a joint force with Burkina Faso soldiers was pursuing the extremists behind the attacks.\n\nThe attack on the camp caused \"heavy equipment losses and major damage,\" Malian government spokesman Yaya Sangar\u00e9 said earlier in a statement.\n\nAround the same time early Monday, armed men attacked another army camp in Mondoro.\n\nA resident there said two civilians were among the casualties. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears for his safety.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 30 people have been killed in Burkina Faso's Bam province the past two weeks, including 17 over the weekend, according to the provincial high commissioner, Ambrose Ouedraogo. The violence in the municipalities of Zimtenga and Bourzanga has displaced nearly 19,000 people in the past three days, he said.\n\nExtremists have gained a larger foothold in Burkina Faso's north in the past few years, staging more attacks near its borders with Mali and Niger.
