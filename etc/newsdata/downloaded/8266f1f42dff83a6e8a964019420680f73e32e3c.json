REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nIn a rare exemption, approved by Canadian aviation regulator Transport Canada, the 11 flights in August and September were partly to maintain the qualifications of senior training pilots, Air Canada told Reuters in response to a query about flight tracking data.\n\nA spokesman for Air Canada said the airline was not able to use similar 737s within its fleet \u201cto maintain check pilot authority in alignment with (Canadian aviation regulations)\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo we are utilizing the 737 Max during planned maintenance movements to maintain qualification.\u201d\n\nBetween Aug 28 and Sept 8 the Air Canada MAX plane criss-crossed between Montreal, Val d\u2019Or, Quebec and North Bay, Ontario, data from Tracking website FlightRadar24 shows.\n\nThen last week, it was flown to Pinal Airpark in Arizona to be parked in a desert storage site. tmsnrt.rs/31tFuMJ\n\nAlthough unusual after the grounding imposed worldwide in March amid concerns over an anti-stall system, the flights highlight growing pressures facing some airlines as they prepare for the return to service of the 400-plane Boeing fleet.\n\nThe planes have been sitting idle since March following two crashes in the space of five months.\n\nFor airlines like Air Canada, which did not have earlier versions of Boeing 737s in their fleets, this has made it difficult to make sure pilots can demonstrate the skills required to retain their licenses.\n\nAs North America\u2019s sole MAX operator which had not flown the earlier 737NG, Air Canada cannot use that model to maintain the qualifications of its check or trainer pilots, the company said.\n\nSo regulator Transport Canada authorized a select group of Air Canada\u2019s check pilots to fly the grounded jet, which was also conducting maintenance flights, the airline said.\n\nAll the jets have the same control software suspected of contributing to the accidents, which Boeing is now in the process of revising to smooth its impact. However, some pilots have said existing procedures can prevent similar accidents.\n\nBoeing declined to comment.\n\nMARKET BATTLE\n\nTransport Canada said in an email that it authorized the flights \u201cbecause the carrier does not operate the Boeing 737 NG aircraft, but the pilots still need to maintain currency.\u201d\n\nHowever, one U.S. carrier questioned by Reuters said such flights would not be possible in the United States where pilot training was not included in a list of exemptions to the ban issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\u201cPilot currency isn\u2019t a listed exemption in the U.S. order,\u201d an FAA spokeswoman confirmed.\n\nNorth American MAX operators, including Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines and Canada\u2019s WestJet Airlines, said they would only move their MAX jets for maintenance and storage purposes.\n\nAir Canada\u2019s position as a newly-converted 737 operator follows a seven-year battle between Boeing and Airbus over the introduction of airplanes offering bold new fuel savings.\n\nThe introduction of the MAX, an upgrade of earlier 737 models with advanced new engines, coincided with a bitter contest for market share between Boeing and Europe\u2019s Airbus, which was offering its similar A320neo.\n\nThe feud saw both planemakers use the transition to a new generation of jets to try to poach each other\u2019s customers, and traders said Air Canada\u2019s 2013 decision to switch from Airbus\u2019s A320 family to Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX stood out as a major defection.\n\nNow, the decision to switch suppliers potentially weighs on some of those same airlines as they cope without a 737 fleet.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Air Canada signage is pictured at Vancouver's international airport in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada, February 5, 2019.
