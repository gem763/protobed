I am basically the phrase \u201cget off my lawn!\u201d That\u2019s how bothered I am!\n\nFirst: It was very exciting to see some of our favorite witchy sisters from Charmed, Piper and Phoebe (Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano), reunite on Grey\u2019s as part of ABC\u2019s \u201cCast From the Past\u201d stunt. Here, they are estranged sisters Heidi and Haylee (because of course!) who arrive at Pac-North when their third sister (Heather, naturally) falls 30 feet and is declared brain dead. The two sisters fighting over how to handle it and then finally coming together and mending fences in the end, as they take their sister off life support, is a nice story\u2014until Heidi gets a call from Heather and they learn the woman Webber just unhooked from life support is not their sister, but a woman who stole their sister\u2019s wallet. You guys, this is played for laughs! I mean, Alex talks about it being bad for the hospital, but mostly, it\u2019s for laughs! I feel like this is a much bigger deal. I know that woman was a thief, but she\u2019s a thief who belongs to someone. Anyway: bothered.\n\nAlso bothering me: THE QADRI THING. Like, are you kidding me Qadri? You get upset that Meredith Grey is fired and can\u2019t do a super cool surgery on an old patient of hers even though you still get to scrub in on said surgery with Jo, who is, according to some, also a very good surgeon? You roll your eyes at Jo and Bailey, your superiors, every time they mention that Meredith is gone and also not the second coming? You give sass DURING THE SURGERY because Meredith Grey is merely video conferencing in from the community service she has been ordered by the court to do because she committed insurance fraud? You cry out in the hallway because you only came to Grey Sloan for Meredith and now she\u2019s gone? TO BAILEY? And you insult every other doctor in that hospital? Oh, Qadri, you idiot. Do not act surprised that Bailey fires you on the spot. You deserve it and also there are way too many characters on this show. Again: I! Am! Bothered!\n\nOh, wait, you know what really bothers me? The fact that the show is setting up a situation in which Webber might cheat on Catherine with Gemma (welcome back, Jasmine Guy!), who you might remember as another one of Ollie\u2019s sponsees who showed up at Grey Sloan last season with a stiletto stuck in her chest. Gemma, thanks to Richard\u2019s help, works at Pac-North in the billing department and she and Richard are very friendly and very much going out to dinner to talk about how he pulled the plug on someone who was NOT the Charmed ladies\u2019 sister while Catherine is in Chicago and not answering her phone. Richard and Catherine are in a rough place after his abrupt termination, but let\u2019s not do this to them. Please! Please don\u2019t bother me anymore with this!\n\nThe good news is not every storyline made me want to hurl my television into the ocean. I do not know how it happened, but I\u2026am\u2026into this thing with Amelia and Link. I can\u2019t believe I put that in writing, but the heart is a mysterious thing, we know this!\n\nAt the top of the hour, Amelia tells Maggie that she and Link are keeping the baby. When Maggie asks how she feels, she tells her sister she feels \u201cbewildered.\u201d She\u2019s excited, of course, but also scared out of her mind. She\u2019s not ready to tell anyone else. And then she goes to work and gets distracted working on a case in which an older Korean woman who can\u2019t speak English is found wandering the hospital calling out \u201cBird! Bird!\u201d and has been admitted for dehydration until they can figure out what to do with her.\n\nMeanwhile, Maggie\u2019s doing an easy-peasy operation on a man named Bertie, who is all about getting his steps in and posting updates about his surgery on Facebook, and generally being a very endearing grandpa-like figure in the halls of Grey Sloan. While Maggie\u2019s placing a stent to fix some blockages in his heart, he\u2019s awake, and he starts talking about regrets he\u2019s had in his life, mumbles something about being too early at a train station, and declares that love is everything.\n\nPost-surgery, Bertie\u2019s walking with Maggie to get his steps in and they run into Amelia and her patient\u2026 and he knows her! And Bertie is that \u201cbird\u201d the woman\u2019s been talking about! And they were each other\u2019s first loves.\n\nThe two met when he was a soldier in the Korean war and they fell in love, only able to communicate through a dictionary. She was going to come with him when he was leaving the country, but his train time was changed and he had to leave, never seeing her again but always regretting it. Sooyoung, through Nico, who is interpreting, confesses that she didn\u2019t even go to the train station at the agreed upon time\u2014she was too scared to leave her family and her home. She regretted it. And then one day she found him online and saw his posts about his surgery, and so hopped on a plane to Seattle to reunite with her long lost love. BE STILL MY HEART. Maggie and Amelia listen to this incredible story and can\u2019t help but be moved. Love, you guys! Love!\n\nThe tale of regret and missing out on something great because of fear inspires Amelia to fully embrace her pregnancy. She wants to stop being scared and share the good things in her life. So she and Link go for a super cool hangout with Meredith and DeLuca in which she drops the big ol\u2019 pregnancy bomb right in the middle of a conversation, and friends, you\u2019ve never seen Meredith so excited. She scoots right in the middle of Amelia and Link and tells her she is so happy to be Auntie Mer. It is adorable and very positive for someone who is spending her days cleaning beehives out of toilets while waiting to learn if she\u2019ll be stripped of her medical license and have her entire career ruined. I guess that\u2019s just life, huh? All about the ups and downs!\n\nLaughter Is The Best Medicine, Apart From Real Medicine\n\n\u2022 Tom\u2019s restraining order on Owen can\u2019t last forever, can it? Tom making Owen leave whenever he arrives is already getting old and it\u2019s only been one episode! Thankfully, Owen decides he wants to stay at home with Allison and have Teddy come back to work\u2014they hang out in the hospital all day, and Owen\u2019s never seen Teddy happier. She needs to get back in the O.R.\n\n\u2022 Schmitt pulls a Schmitt and accidentally drops a guide wire into a patient\u2019s body while trying to put in a catheter, a very basic procedure, and almost kills the guy. DeLuca takes the brunt of Bailey\u2019s ire for it since he was in charge (and is still on Bailey\u2019s Angry List). When Nico hears about it, he won\u2019t stand for having a boyfriend unwilling to live up to his potential and demands Schmitt go to the skills lab and practice until he can do it perfectly. But also he\u2019ll be there and he\u2019ll bring pizza because those two are very cute these days and as Nico points out, he\u2019s \u201cnot dead inside.\u201d\n\n\u2022 A round of applause for the awkwardest arm pat in the history of awkward arm pats, please! Maggie and Vic run into each other in the hospital\u2014after Vic and Jackson have run their faces into each other while he was stitching up a cut on her forehead\u2014and Vic doesn\u2019t want things to be weird between them, but honestly, has she ever met Maggie Pierce before?\n\n\u2022 Wait, and even bigger round of applause for the Meredith-DeLuca \u201cMorning Community Service Drop Off\u201d make out session. We need more steam this season!\n\n\u2022 Meredith\u2019s joy was not relegated to news of becoming an aunt: She sees Bokhee in the operating room over the video chat and can\u2019t contain herself! Who is this Meredith?!\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou\u2019re fired. Now you and your hero have something in common.\u201d Angry Bailey is Savage Bailey (and I love her).\n\n\u2022 \u201cA psychic is not a therapist!\u201d", "description": "Our favorite witchy sisters pop into Grey Sloan for a storyline that\u2019s far from this episode\u2019s most charmed.
