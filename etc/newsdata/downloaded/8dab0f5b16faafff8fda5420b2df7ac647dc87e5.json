Instagram/Rihana Petra, Instagram/Rihana Petra\n\nDespite his former wife continuing to post updates of their baby and love story on Instagram, the lawyer of Kelantan\u2019s Sultan Muhammad V has confirmed their split and even claimed that the identity of the baby\u2019s father is currently in question.\n\nSingaporean lawyer Koh Tien Hua of law firm Eversheds Harry Elias LLP reportedly told The Sunday Times on July 21 that the couple had indeed divorced, as speculated on social media.\n\nRumors of the split began after a copy of the divorce certificate was leaked online, which listed it as a \u201ctriple talaq\u201d divorce, a type of traditional Islamic divorce. Under this divorce, a Muslim man can leave his wife simply by saying the word \u201ctalaq\u201d three times.\n\nThe certificate appears to bear the Kelantan state crest and was marked as the copy for the wife.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, Koh confirmed that the Sultan had indeed divorced Rihana Oksana Petra (also known as Oksana Voevodina) \u201cby three talaqs in the presence of two competent Muslim witnesses\u201d.\n\nHe also confirmed that the divorce was filed on June 22 in Singapore\u2019s Syariah Court, and finalised on July 1 with permission from Kelantan\u2019s Syariah Court.\n\nThese claims contradict statements given by the former Miss Moscow winner to Malaysian news portal Malaysiakini (later carried by The Straits Times) that she was not in Singapore in June for any divorce proceedings, but instead in Russia with her baby.\n\n\u201cI have not been given any admonition of divorce,\u201d Malaysiakini quoted her as saying. \u201cThis is an act of provocation. We have never been divorced.\u201d\n\nKoh, however, claimed the former model was informed of the divorce through her lawyers, which he identified as Russian firm Alexander Dobrovinsky & Partners.\n\nShe was also given a copy of the divorce certificate, he added.\n\nLawyer: \u201cNo objective evidence\u201d on father of the child\n\nAccording to a report by UK daily MailOnline, the Sultan allegedly had doubts that Rihana\u2019s two-month-old son, Ismail Leon Petra, was truly his heir.\n\nThe baby was born earlier in May, 11 months after the couple married in an Islamic ceremony on June 7, a date Rihana referred to in an Instagram post as the \u201cBirthday of our family\u201d.\n\nAccording to a report by Russian international television network RT, the pair subsequently visited a fertility clinic in Germany, as the Sultan was \u201canxious to start a family\u201d.\n\nThe 50-year-old monarch\u2019s previous marriage to royal descendant Kangsadal Pipitpakdee in 2004 produced no children.\n\nFollowing the wedding, the Sultan \u2013 who was then Malaysia\u2019s King \u2013 made history as the first-ever ruler to abdicate, with observers speculating that the move was linked to unhappiness over his marriage to Rihana.\n\nKoh told the Sunday Times that there was \u201cno objective evidence, as yet, as to the biological father of the child\u201d, and asked that the former King\u2019s privacy \u201cbe respected\u201d.\n\nAccording to MailOnline\u2019s report, a close friend of Rihana\u2019s rubbished the Sultan\u2019s fatherhood doubts, saying that the father and son \u201cshare one face\u201c.\n\nWhile Rihana has posted multiple photos of the child to her Instagram page, none show his face, which is often hidden or angled away from the camera.\n\nMailOnline reported that a source close to the Sultan claimed he had disinherited the baby and would not bestow royal titles on his former wife or child, but was willing to provide for them.\n\nThe report also cited sources saying that Rihana had married the Sultan under the impression that she would be given the title of Queen, and her son would be the crown prince of Kelantan.\n\nThe Kelantan Palace has never acknowledged their marriage, and issued a statement on July 16 that no one was to be called \u201cQueen of Kelantan\u201d without the title being officially conferred.\n\nIt added that Sultan Muhammad V\u2019s younger brother, Tengku Muhammad Faiz Petra, was the rightful crown prince.\n\nObservers believe that the statement was targeted at an Instagram post Rihana wrote on July 11, in which she referred to her son as the future crown prince of Kelantan.\n\nMany also noted the stark difference between the palace\u2019s treatment of Rihana and another foreign bride, Swedish national Sofie Louise Johansson, who wed the crown prince.\n\nUnlike Rihana, Sofie\u2019s marriage in April was officially announced, and she was given the title Yang Berbahagia Cik Puan, an honorific for nobility.\n\n\u201cI cannot hold back tears\u201d: Rihana\n\nIn her latest Instagram post dated July 22, Rihana said that she had faced \u201ca lot of malice, slander, and envy\u201d.\n\nShe did not mention the divorce rumours in particular, but said she was \u201cproud\u201d that her son was of Malaysian descent, adding that she was willing to do anything to \u201cgrow worthy of (Malaysians\u2019) love\u201d for his sake.\n\n\u201cI am writing this post and I cannot hold back tears,\u201d she said, describing them as tears of happiness and gratitude for support received.\n\n\u201cI want to tell all the people from Malaysia: you have big hearts, because you accepted and supported me \u2013 a girl who was born in another country and grown in a different culture.\u201d\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - This week, Rihana said that she had faced \"a lot of malice, slander, and envy\"..
