The Andrews Labor government promised to spend $72 billion on public transport at the 2018 Victorian election, the Berejiklian Liberal government pledged $42 billion at the 2019 NSW election and the Morrison government $13 billion at the May election.\n\nSydney's major projects include the city and western Sydney metro lines and rail link to the under construction western Sydney airport. Melbourne's big ticket projects are the suburban rail loop and airport link.\n\nAs well as public transport alternatives, the institute's report said technological advances such as in-car electronic tags and automatic number plate recognition have made it easier to levy congestion charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe institute also claims public resistance to congestion charging is not as bad as governments, pointing to experiences in other cities where it has been embraced as motorists realise the benefits of fewer cars on the road.\n\nThe report rejects claims a congestion charge is unfair by unduly hitting poorer motorists, saying the median income for a full-time worker who drives into Sydney's CBD is $2450 a week and $1980 in Melbourne.\n\nIndustry group Infrastructure Partnerships Australia rejected Grattan's call for a CBD cordon, claiming it did not reflect the conditions motorists in Sydney and Melbourne faced.\n\n\"Most of the vehicle kilometres in Sydney and Melbourne are actually travelled outside of the CBD,\" the organisation said.\n\n\"As a result, a CBD-based cordon charge would not be an effective mechanism to institute behaviour change and therefore reduced congestion.\n\n\"Only a whole-of-network charging system provides a solution to the twofold problem of congestion and funding. A whole-of-network charge provides for unified charging of vehicles across the whole network that goes beyond a city cordon.\"", "description": "Modelling by the Grattan Institute suggests charging motorists to enter Sydney and Melbourne CBDs would reduce traffic by 40 per cent in the morning peak.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bb9d1781c6a7761275fd2d934b39838465433a1c", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
