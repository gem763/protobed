The bill was drawn up by cross-party MPs, including 21 Tory rebels who have since been ousted from the parliamentary party.\n\nIt is thought that Mr Johnson believes he could legally disregard some or all of the bill's requirements - a move that could see him hauled before the courts and potentially facing prison.\n\nThis, in turn, could trigger an emergency judicial review by the Supreme Court next month, leading to a court showdown over whether the UK would be able to leave the EU with no deal on 31 October.\n\nOn Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News the government will \"look very carefully\" at its \"interpretation\" of the legislation.\n\nElection moves continue\n\nMr Johnson has written in the Mail on Sunday and Sunday Express that on Monday he will offer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \"one last chance\" to agree to an early election.\n\nOpposition parties have agreed not to back his demand for a general election before the EU summit in mid-October, and say they will vote against the government's proposal at a vote on Monday.\n\nIf Mr Corbyn refuses, Mr Johnson said \"this government will simply carry on\".\n\nIn other developments, ahead of the vote on Monday:\n\nThe government is also planning - in a breach of convention - to stand a candidate against the Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, at the next election for allowing rebel MPs to take control of the Parliamentary timetable.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said France would not be able to support another Brexit delay \"in the current circumstances\"\n\nAsked to rule out a possible pact with The Brexit Party at a future election, Mr Javid said the Tories \"don't need an electoral alliance with anyone\"\n\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said \"we are doing everything we can\" to reach a deal.\n\nBut he said the EU were setting a test on the Irish backstop arrangement that is \"impossible to meet\".\n\nThe backstop - a position of last resort to maintain a seamless border on the island of Ireland - is proving a serious obstacle to Mr Johnson's Brexit plans.\n\nMr Barclay said the government is proposing \"reasonable alternative solutions\" but he objected to the EU's demand for \"molecular detail\" on how they would work before 31 October.\n\nWho is Amber Rudd?", "description": "Up to 90% of government effort is on no-deal, with no evidence of any formal negotiations to get an EU deal, she says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07msr1s.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
