Domestically, there is little doubt the Premier League perch has become the occupied territory of the blue half of Manchester.\n\nSo how did Klopp respond? He claimed he does not know what a \u2018perch\u2019 is.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI'll try to Google it but I am not sure I will find out what it means exactly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat I heard is how it often is in life, without the context. We are all adults and we say things and sometimes people have to deal with things that I say and in this case people seem to think I have to deal with things Peter said.\n\n\u201cI'm not angry about him or whatever. I like Peter. So now if people come to me constantly and ask, 'are you still on the perch or not?' I still won't understand what the word perch means.\u201d\n\nSuffice to say, Klopp is unlikely to seek clarity on the definition until a more appropriate time - preferable with title winners' medal around his neck.\n\nShould Liverpool preserve their current position at the top of the Premier League and claim the club\u2019s 19th league title, Fergie\u2019s quote will doubtless be revived and reviewed in a modern context.\n\nBut Liverpool are not back on their perch yet\u2026 they are merely edging closer to ruling the roost again.", "description": "It is one of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s most quoted remarks, even if time has created some memory lapses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hfHQ0js.fH.XRiQipQ_WOQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qqNO0i70CEbF69ee.203Kg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/d9b188e808180a37e33399df1c583275", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
