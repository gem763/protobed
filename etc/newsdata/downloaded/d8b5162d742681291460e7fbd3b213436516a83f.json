A breakup of a family is certainly an eye-opener that as one \u2014 and I\u2019m speaking in general again \u2014 but as one needs to understand, I had to understand my own culpability in that, and what can I do better. I don\u2019t want to go on like this.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Pitt has opened up about his divorce from Jolie, with whom he shares six children\u2014daughters Zahara, 14, Shiloh, 13, and Vivienne, 11, and sons Maddox, 18, Pax, 15, and Knox, 11.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times earlier this month (also to promote Ad Astra), Pitt explained that his divorce ultimately prompted him to give up drinking and start attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\n\n\n\"I had taken things as far as I could take it, so I removed my drinking privilege,\" he said of the decision, before delving into his experiences in AA. \"You had all these men sitting around being open and honest in a way I have never heard. It was this safe space where there was little judgment, and therefore little judgment of yourself. It was actually really freeing just to expose the ugly sides of yourself. There\u2019s great value in that.\"\n\n\n\n[H/T People]\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "He said he's been reflecting on \"what can I do better.\"", "authors": ["Kayleigh Roberts"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wskr4KWsnLTLV8lW3NJ3RQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/d6fc70c537e29d4655068c5a16f91028", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
