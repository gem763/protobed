At first I thought it was a spider with scorpion-like looks, but after a closer look I had no idea and tried to research what it was.\u201d\n\n(Image: Credit: Pen News/Pedro Goss)\n\nAstri Leroy, chairman of South Africa\u2019s Spider Club, said Pedro had encountered a solifugae \u2013 a creature that\u2019s been called both a spider and a scorpion, but in fact is neither.\n\n\u201cIn English they are variously called camel spiders, wind spiders, wind scorpions and sun spiders, but they are neither spiders nor scorpions,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey are fierce little predators and quite aggressive with a high metabolic rate so they have to eat a lot and if they can overpower another small creature they will do so.\n\n(Image: Credit: Pen News/Pedro Goss)\n\n\u201cThis means that their prey is not only insects and other invertebrates but also small vertebrates if they can catch them. They have no venom but they are fast and strong and have a four-part scissor-like set of jaws lined with sharp little teeth and two beady eyes.\u201d\n\nIn Pedro\u2019s clip, the creature is scuttling around quickly and appears to be burrowing into the earth.\n\n\u201cThe movement of it was rapid and it was changing direction very quickly,\u201d said Pedro, from London. \u201cAt the time of when I saw it, it was digging a hole with its head, burrowing and shovelling dirt with its back legs out of the hole.\u201d\n\nMrs Leroy said this was typical behaviour when the solifugae feels threatened.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cI don't think they see too well and those hairs are sensory organs which pick up airborne and other vibrations,\u201d she said. \"In addition they have a further set of sensory organs under their fourth pair of legs called racquet organs or malleoli.\n\n\u201cThese \u2018feel\u2019 the substrate because it is important for them to know what kind of soil they are on. If they are caught out in the open and feel threatened they will dig a hole in the ground at high speed and disappear.\u201d\n\nFor Pedro, who was visiting family in Lesotho, it\u2019s an encounter he won\u2019t soon forget.\n\n\u201cBeing from London it was a great opportunity for me to see other forms of wildlife than the common English pigeon, a seagull nibbling a chip or a rat on the underground,\u201d he said.", "description": "The creature has been called both a spider and scorpion in the past, but in fact is neither, according to experts", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Credit", "Pen News Pedro Goss"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558533.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-PNSCORPSPIDER04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
