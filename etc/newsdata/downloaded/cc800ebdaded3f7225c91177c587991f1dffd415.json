An argument that sparked between Nancy and Johnson's friend, Justin Rouse, Saturday afternoon culminated in Johnson and Rouse exiting Nancy's Toyota Yaris at an intersection in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, and Nancy driving off before Johnson could unbuckle his daughter, authorities said.\n\nWhen Nancy was pulled over two hours later, neither Nalani nor the car seat were in the vehicle, according to authorities.\n\nNancy initially told investigators during an interview that Johnson \"sold\" his daughter to an unnamed individual for $10,000 and gave her instructions to drop the child off to a woman who would \"flag\" her down along U.S. Route 22, according to a criminal complaint filed by the police department on Saturday.\n\nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children\n\nNancy claimed she encountered two woman next to a silver SUV with out-of-state license plates and turned the girl over to them, according to the complaint. Detectives have not found any evidence to corroborate Nancy's account, McDonough said.\n\nNancy was charged with kidnapping of a minor, interference with custody of children and concealment of the whereabouts of a child, according to the criminal complaint. It's unclear whether she has retained an attorney or entered a plea.\n\nAlthough Nancy's vehicle had Uber and Lyft stickers on it, she was not acting in the capacity of a ride-share driver at the time of Nalani's disappearance, McDonough said. Spokespeople for Uber and Lyft confirmed to ABC News that Nancy did not take any rides that day. In addition, Nancy's account with Lyft has been deactivated, the company's spokesman said.\n\nWe are working closely with @PSPTroopAPIO @AlleghenyCoDA @AlleghenyCoPD @FBIPittsburgh and Indiana County Coroner to bring justice for Nalani Johnson. Please keep the men and women working this case in your prayers they are true professionals but still are humans with families \u2014 Indiana County DA (@IndianaCountyDA) September 4, 2019\n\nNalani would have turned 2 this month, WTAE reported. The circumstances surrounding her death remain unclear, but an autopsy is scheduled to be completed on Wednesday, Dougherty said.\n\nInvestigators are requesting business owners and residents along the Route 22 corridor check for surveillance footage that may be relevant to the investigation. Detectives are also looking for anyone who knows Nancy or may have information on Nalani's disappearance or death to contact them.", "description": "The toddler who went missing after a rideshare driver claimed her family sold her for $10,000 has been found dead in a Pennsylvania nature park, according to authorities.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/nalani-ht-er-190903_hpMain_v4x3_16x9_992.jpg"}
