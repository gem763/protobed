It details how, in 2017, they finally unmasked the alleged \u2013 his trial is pending \u2013 serial rapist. Shortly after publication, however, much interest has alighted on another, less familiar figure in this story, who was once as fully committed as Weinstein to silencing and shaming survivors, intimidating reporters and rebuilding his good name: a US lawyer called Lisa Bloom.\n\nAt the same time as it offers inspiration and guidance to investigative reporters in pursuit of powerful bullies, She Said \u2013 with its startling new evidence about Bloom\u2019s involvement \u2013 also supplies a priceless introduction, for novices, to the business of reputation management.\n\nHow is it that some obvious shits still prosper, or make rapid comebacks as deferred-to public figures, despite persuasive rumours or actual evidence of, say, sexual molestation, bullying and serial dishonesty? How do their misdemeanours sometimes descend so swiftly from the top of Google searches? Some of that will be attributable to luck, time or the process whereby, as some of our leading douches have demonstrated, continually overlaid offensiveness, on a vast and sufficiently public scale, will effectively neutralise decades of misconduct. How many times, after all, can one react to the transformation of a proved GBH plotter, racist, liar, sexist and idle, incontinently shagging idiot into a national leader?\n\nBut Bloom sets out, in an email revealed by Kantor and Twohey, the potential benefits of employing reputation professionals when the concealment of specific wrongdoing is urgent or less amenable to denial.\n\nA woman\u2019s advocate, with \u2013 in December 2016 \u2013 a still-intact reputation as a feminist, Bloom offered her services to Weinstein; allegations of his sexual misconduct were circulating. Much of the relevant memo, which deserves to be read in full, features slurs against Rose McGowan, one of the earliest and bravest of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, alongside assurances that Bloom understands, from her experience representing survivors, just how to deal with \u201cthe Roses of the world\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harvey Weinstein paid for Rose McGowan to be falsely befriended by an agent from the Israeli firm, Black Cube. Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP\n\nOptions for shutting down McGowan\u2019s accusations include, Bloom suggests: (1) falsely befriending her; (2) \u201ccounterops\u201d, an \u201conline campaign to push back and call her out as a pathological liar\u2026 we can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued\u201d; (3) a scary cease and desist letter; and, more positively, (4) and (5) a phony show of repentance from Weinstein \u2013 \u201cthis is very doable\u201d \u2013 along with ostentatious, targeted philanthropy, to prove that Weinstein, the predator of the \u201cRoses of the world\u201d, is on the contrary a hero: friend and benefactor to the Roses of the world.\n\nFor instance, Bloom says: \u201cStart the Weinstein foundation, focusing on gender equality in film, etc.\u201d Finally, Bloom proposes working with a reputation management company to mess with Google searches: \u201cYour first page of Google is key\u2026 Easy to do.\u201d She was hired, for $895 per hour. Only much later, after intercessions on behalf of Weinstein that included a threatening appearance in the reporters\u2019 newsroom, did Bloom describe her involvement as a \u201ccolossal mistake\u201d.\n\nThis expert in counterops blamed the mistake on her \u201cnaivete\u201d. It has not advanced her repentance journey, either, that the true extent of Bloom\u2019s concern for survivors was revealed in the same week that Margaret Atwood\u2019s vicious collaborator, Aunt Lydia, reappeared in The Testaments. \u201cWhat good is it to throw yourself in front of a steamroller out of moral principle?\u201d Lydia reasons. \u201cBetter to hurl rocks than have them hurled at you.\u201d\n\nAs for Weinstein: he did pay for McGowan to be falsely befriended by an agent from the Israeli firm Black Cube; he repented, lavishly and, in retrospect, hilariously \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve asked Lisa Bloom to tutor me\u201d; he pledged $5m for a scholarship fund, at the University of Southern California, for female film-makers, \u201cnamed after my mom\u201d.\n\nWhile undetectability, the heart of reputation management, makes it hard to know which of our most improbably respected names owe their survival to a Bloom-like playbook, her focus on philanthropy as a redemptive tool ought to establish, finally, for organisations yet to grasp this point, that offers of money from compromised or suspect donors mean they are being used.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Some of the world\u2019s most brilliant academics happily accepted invitations and visits, as well as funds, from Jeffrey Epstein.\u2019 Photograph: Rick Friedman/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nIn Weinstein\u2019s case, intended beneficiaries were, effectively, cast as accomplices in Bloom\u2019s Rose-persecution schedule. But at other times they might be helping purge historical links with, say, Vladimir Putin, with fascist organisations or with discreditable financial practices. You sometimes get the impression that, usefully for donors and their advisers, complacency on this point, and carelessness about complicity, is most likely in organisations whose motives are unassailably pure and high-minded.\n\nFor some reason, some of the world\u2019s most brilliant academics happily accepted invitations and visits, as well as funds, from Jeffrey Epstein, the relentless paedophile, founder of the Epstein Foundation, and friend of Prince Andrew.\n\nAlthough students at USC successfully campaigned to reject Weinstein\u2019s gift, numerous male scientists, including those at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, reportedly the recipient of $7.5m, accepted swag from the Epstein Foundation, thus helping position its creator, in websites that popped up on Google, as an unworldly brainiac. His customary female attendants could be, it appears, overlooked by the truly gifted and talented.\n\nA female academic recalls, in Ronan Farrow\u2019s report, being concerned for the wellbeing of two young women accompanying Epstein when he visited MIT in 2015: \u201cThey were models. Eastern European, definitely.\u201d The Media Lab director has now resigned. But its co-founder, the digital utopian Nicholas Negroponte, says he\u2019d take Epstein\u2019s cash all over again. \u201cWe all knew he went to jail for soliciting underage prostitution, but we thought he served his term and repented.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, thanks to Epstein, yet another reputation falls due for professional refurbishment. Prince Andrew might know someone.\n\n\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist", "description": "Lisa Bloom and her kind can\u2019t be squeamish when whitewashing the rich and powerful", "authors": ["Catherine Bennett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/834d7ea4c4bf808f6789aed449a962ad439d3794/0_553_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d2147567bd425837c389e35ae32b18fc", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
