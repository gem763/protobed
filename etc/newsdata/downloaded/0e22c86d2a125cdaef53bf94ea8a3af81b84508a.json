He insists he respects the teachers, but calls for a protest against the display.\n\nThe school, in Kwambonambi in Kwa-Zulu Natal, is part of the Curro group, and representatives of the group told Parent24 that the project was filmed and uploaded to social media without the school\u2019s consent. This is despite requests to not publicly display a learner\u2019s final artwork, as the project had to be understood within the context of the assigned theme.\n\n\"Curro are cognisant of the allegations made on social media and the matter is currently subject to an internal investigation,\" a Curro representative told us.\n\n\"Curro reiterates that comments made about the school, the artwork and the learner are not an accurate reflection of our school and the situation referred to,\" she said, adding that they reserve the right to withhold comment until the internal investigation has concluded.\n\nAll schools within the Curro group adopt a Christian ethos, and do not condone cyber bullying, religious intolerance or hate speech.\n\nAccording to their website, Grantleigh is an \"independent school with a Christian ethos\", educating students in \"a caring and ethical community\" to think \"creatively for the benefit of humankind and the environment\".\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
