bring people together after conflict; and restore hope to a community after a crisis.'\n\nHowever, 'Empowering Communities', has now been removed completely as a Programme.\n\nPictures showing the two brothers together have also been removed from the home page and replaced with images of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nThe only way to see Harry and Meghan's former work is by looking through the site's 'News' tab, for articles that were uploaded while the couple were still part of the foundation.\n\nThe site had previously proclaimed that 'when people come together they do great things' before saying that the foundation would 'unite people to tackle some of today's biggest challenges.'\n\nWilliam, Kate, Harry and Meghan's joint venture was intended to harness the star power of the four high-profile royals.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex (left) joined the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (right) to launch the first Royal Foundation forum in London on February 28, 2018\n\nThey were dubbed the Fab Four after taking to the stage together at the first - and so far only - Royal Foundation forum in London in February 2018.\n\nAt the time, Harry said 'working as family does have its challenges', but insisted 'we're stuck together for the rest of our lives'.\n\nHowever, after just 18 months, Harry and Meghan's split from the charity was formally announced in June 2019.\n\nA month later, their name was officially removed from the charity's title in documents filed to companies house, renaming it The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nRoyal expert Phil Dampier previously told MailOnline the split is a 'massive mistake', which makes it seem as if the couples are 'pitting against each other, both personally and professionally'.", "description": "Prince William and Kate Middleton's Royal Foundation website has been updated to remove mention of Harry and Meghan, after they officially split from the charity in June 2019.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19440732-0-image-a-120_1570535462864.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
