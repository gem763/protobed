But his identity has always been kept classified as Washington and Riyadh worked closely after the attacks to root out Al-Qaeda's networks throughout the Middle East and South Asia.\n\n\"The FBI recognises the need and desire of victims' families to understand what happened to their loved ones and to hold those responsible accountable,\" the Justice Department said.\n\nThe Justice Department did not say when the name would become public; it plans to supply it to the court first.\n\nBut it suggested the individual might not have been involved with the Al-Qaeda plotters.\n\n\"The information referring to that individual refers to an investigative theory being pursued by the FBI at that time, and does not represent an objective statement of fact,\" it said.\n\nThose involved in the lawsuit cheered the decision.\n\n\"The families are dedicated to getting to the truth, and we shouldn't have to beg for this sort of basic information, or be kept in the dark, about the Saudi role in the attacks,\" said Terry Strada, the national chairman of the group wich sued, the 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] The US Justice Department said on Thursday that it would unmask the long-protected name of a Saudi official who allegedly had ties to the Al-Qaeda perpetrators of the September 11, 2001 attacks. .
