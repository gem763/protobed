My bones were broken in so many places that an operation wasn\u2019t possible.'\n\n'I had to remain in traction while my bones rebuilt themselves.\u2019\n\nJohn\u2019s injuries were so severe, the doctors couldn\u2019t operate until six months later.\n\nHe had 11 operations in total and it was two years before he could walk again.\n\nShortly after he was discharged from hospital, he received a visit from an old friend, Anna.\n\nThey had met in the Cadet Forces \u2013 she had heard about the accident and wanted to check he was OK.\n\n\u2018John was still on crutches at the time,\u2019 says Anna, 34.\n\n\u2018He was in quite a good place, focusing on getting better.'\n\n'But I realised he wasn\u2019t going to cope when he offered me a glass of water, I took one sip and it was full of washing-up liquid \u2013 he hadn\u2019t been able to rinse it properly.\u2019\n\nJohn was off work for 18 months after the accident, then returned to work in a part-time office role on a Zimmer frame.\n\nHe was living on his own and didn\u2019t have any carers, so Anna started helping out with things like cooking meals and washing up.\n\n\u2018We had the same interests, we were company for each other and got on really well,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d sit for hours and hours chatting.\u2019\n\nAs the months went on, they fell in love.\n\nThey married in 2009, between having their two children \u2013 Kieran, now 14, and Summer, now nine.\n\nAlthough John improved physically and was awarded compensation, he couldn\u2019t get over the trauma of what had happened.\n\nThe bus driver was convicted with nine points on his licence and kept his job, whereas John couldn\u2019t go back to work for two years and changed career twice due to stress.\n\n\u2018My mind was still on edge,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I was scared of large vehicles and the sound of a reverse beeping noise \u2013 I would have flashbacks and sometimes be sick.\u2019\n\nHe was also terrified of crowds and didn\u2019t want to leave home.\n\n\u2018Before the accident, I was out of the house all the time,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I loved working with young people, I loved working in sport and outdoors.'\n\n'But because of my injuries, I couldn\u2019t handle the physicality of going for long walks any more.\u2019\n\nJohn volunteered with St John Ambulance and spent five years in the ambulance service as an emergency care assistant, but the irregular hours only increased his anxiety.\n\n\u2018My shift would often overrun and I\u2019d be late getting home to Anna and the kids, and that shot me to pieces,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I would be massively stressed at work all day in case I didn\u2019t finish on time, and if I finished late I\u2019d take it out on the controllers and blame them.'\n\n' It was too much \u2013 I couldn\u2019t live with the pressure.'\n\n\u2018I also had a real problem with anyone who had a job and, in my opinion, wasn\u2019t doing it properly.'\n\n'If a supermarket didn\u2019t have a particular loaf of bread on the shelf, I\u2019d start arguing with the manager; if my mobile phone didn\u2019t work or if the internet went down for 10 minutes, I\u2019d have large verbal arguments with the customer services agent.'\n\n'I felt people should be held accountable for their actions.\u2019\n\nAnna recalls being in a shop where the special offer had been put on the wrong shelf.\n\n\u2018We then proceeded to spend an hour and a half in the store complaining to the manager that it was misleading because we\u2019d bought the wrong bottle of squash,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018The squash was only about \u00a31 \u2013 I think that was the point where I said to John, \u201cYou need to go and find help.\u201d\u2019\n\nConcerned, Anna encouraged John to get support and he had 16 weeks of therapy.\n\nHis behaviour was put down to the fact he felt so let down by life, and the fact the bus driver had not been held accountable, so John wanted everybody else to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nAlthough it helped him understand his behaviour, it didn\u2019t provide a cure.\n\n\u2018I never really asked for help,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I always justified my actions and my argument and therefore I didn\u2019t feel like there was anything wrong.\u2019\n\nThe family left London and moved to the countryside in North Devon in an attempt to live a quieter life.\n\nBut when Anna started working longer hours, John\u2019s anxiety got worse.\n\n\u2018It was wonderful to be out of the city, but any time Anna was away from home, I started to get really anxious \u2013. I couldn\u2019t relax,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018My mind would run all over the place.'\n\n'I\u2019d be so stressed by the time she came home, it got to the point where Anna didn\u2019t want to go out because she didn\u2019t want to see me upset.'\n\n'Our relationship started to break down \u2013 I was making her life hell.\u2019\n\nAs the years rolled on, John\u2019s mental health deteriorated.\n\nHe suffered from depression, began to self-harm and had suicidal thoughts.\n\n\u2018I felt like I was letting everybody down,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018It was beginning to take over my life, but I didn\u2019t know what to do.'\n\n\u2018I tried to hide it from the kids, but they became aware of it over time.'\n\n'Both children now have anxiety and have spoken about not being sure how Dad is.'\n\n'They are much more understanding after reading a book called Why Is Dad So Mad? \u2013 a story about a military dad with PTSD written especially for kids.\u2019\n\nJohn had counselling and various types of therapy and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but none of the treatment seemed to help.\n\nThen last year, at a Combat Stress hospital (a place to help veterans\u2019 mental health), he was introduced to the therapeutic power of animals and a doctor told him a puppy might help with his anxiety.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d never thought of it as a mechanism for coping before,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018We already had a family dog, a crossbreed called Bolt, but he was old and set in his ways.'\n\n'The doctor explained puppies can help manage stress and focus the mind.\u2019\n\nIn May 2019, they enlisted the help of a four-legged companion \u2013 a black Labrador pup called Gibson.\n\n\u2018After just a few weeks, I could feel myself improving,\u2019 explains John.\n\n\u2018If I was feeling anxious, he would jump up on the sofa and sit on my chest and I found that really reassuring and comforting.'\n\n'It doesn\u2019t matter where I am, he\u2019ll pin me down, hold me tight and it\u2019s really helped with my anxiety.'\n\n'We go out and play frisbee and I now look forward to going out for walks, whereas before I would always make excuses to stay in the house, which would make me feel worse \u2013 to say he\u2019s changed my life is an understatement.\u2019\n\nSince John has been taking Gibson for walks three or four times a day, Anna has also noticed a difference.\n\n\u2018Initially, John was so focused on medically getting better, I don\u2019t think the long-term impact really hit him,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018Gibson has made a huge impact.'\n\n'He has been a massive help and comfort to him \u2013 it has given him a focus and new lease of life.'\n\n'Gibson is an incredible dog that adores John \u2013 he\u2019s a fantastic companion.\u2019\n\nJohn is now taking part in Generation Pup, a groundbreaking study that tracks puppies through to adulthood to learn how their early experiences and environment affect their development.\n\nJohn says, \u2018I really enjoy watching my relationship with Gibson flourish and tracking this through the study, watching as his personality begins to grow and support me on my road back to mental health, which he is playing a big part of.'\n\n'Gibson has done so much for me in a short space of time, I wanted to do something for him.\u2019 \u25a0\n\nGeneration Pup: The Facts\n\nGeneration Pup follows dogs over their lifetime to see how events or environments early in life influence their development as they get older.\n\nThe research also looks at why dogs develop problem behaviours and issues such as noise phobia and separation anxiety.\n\nIt is the largest study of dog health and welfare in a generation.\n\nMore than 3,000 dog owners have signed up so far and the aim is to have over 10,000.\n\nDogs Trust is calling on puppy owners of all breeds to take part (before the puppies are 16 weeks old).\n\nNew recruits receive an annual personalised report tracking their dog\u2019s behaviour and development.\n\nGeneration Pup is funded by Dogs Trust, the UK\u2019s largest dog welfare charity.
