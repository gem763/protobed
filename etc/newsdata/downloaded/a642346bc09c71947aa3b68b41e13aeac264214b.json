If Prime Minister Boris Johnson is forced to request another extension from the EU later this month, he will go to the polls facing a fired up Nigel Farage ready to accuse him of selling out the Brexiteers and failing to deliver his signature promise of leaving by Halloween.\n\nThe fallout could be devastating for the Conservative Party, and for Brexit.\n\nIf a significant chunk of the Tory vote sides with the radical forces of the Brexit Party, that could allow a rainbow coalition of anti-Brexit parties to secure a majority in Parliament. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the nationalist parties from Scotland and Wales in control of events, a second referendum that could cancel Brexit would become all but inevitable.\n\nThat\u2019s why Johnson uttered the phrase \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by Oct. 31 no fewer than eight times during his first speech as leader to the annual party conference in Manchester on Wednesday. If he secures Brexit first, polls and seat analysis suggest he would sweep to victory in an election.\n\nUnfortunately for Johnson, European Union officials are pouring cold water on the chances of a deal this month and Britain\u2019s Parliament has passed a law preventing him from forcing the country out without one.\n\nJohnson is backed into a corner and looking at increasingly unlikely solutions to escape. His premiership depends on it, and he is still almost two months short of avoiding a place in the history books as Britain\u2019s shortest serving prime minister.\n\nDrumbeat\n\nOn the eve of the Conservative Party conference last Friday, the hardline forces of Brexit gathered in central London to remind Johnson just how much pressure he is under from the right. Before an electrified crowd in Westminster, Farage taunted Johnson, who had tried to \u201cout-Brexit the Brexit Party\u201d in the belief that traditional Conservative voters would return to base.\n\n\u201cBut here we are!\u201d Farage bellowed. \u201cThe reason Brexit Party voters are not going to go back en masse is very simple\u2014we just don\u2019t trust the Conservative Party!\u201d\n\nThe problem was exemplified by one of Johnson\u2019s former Conservative colleagues who was also on stage. Ann Widdecombe was a high-profile Conservative lawmaker for more than 20 years, but earlier this year she was elected as a member of the European Parliament for the Brexit Party during the stunning May elections in which the Euroskeptic party finished in first place\u2014and the Conservatives fell back into fifth.\n\nShe sent the crowd into raptures by threatening to repeat the trick at the coming election unless Johnson secures a hard Brexit by Oct. 31. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, then he is going to find that the next general election for him will be like leading the charge of the Light Brigade,\u201d she warned, recasting Lord Tennyson\u2019s epic poem about a disastrous cavalry charge.\n\nBrexit to right of him, Brexit to left of him, Brexit in front of him, Volleying and thundering...\n\nThe next line was drowned out by cheers, but Johnson is well aware of his predicament. When asked his week on the BBC about allegations of sexual misconduct, the prime minister invoked the very next line himself: \u201cStormed at with shot and shell.\u201d\n\nBackstage, Widdecombe explained that Johnson was partly to blame for the position he\u2019s found himself in. He made a \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to deliver Brexit by Halloween during the leadership race that saw him succeed Theresa May in July, and he\u2019s spent the last three months repeating the date over and over.\n\n\u201cIf he asks for an extension, his standing would collapse completely,\u201d Widdecombe told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe\u2019s invested a huge amount of personal capital in this, he really has.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit Party has made it clear that it would back Johnson, and even form an electoral pact, if he commits to a \u201cNo Deal\u201d Brexit, which would instantly withdraw Britain from all of the institutions, trade deals, and reciprocal arrangements of the EU. Critics of this position point out that Britain would immediately have to begin negotiating its way back into similar relationships\u2014from a position of weakness as the domestic economy readjusts.", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/GettyMANCHESTER, England\u2014The two biggest names in Brexit are headed for a ferocious general-election showdown that threatens to take down the entire project as collateral damage.
