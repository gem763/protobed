Instead of a luxurious biopic celebrating her life as a pop culture phenomenon-turned-legal-bad-bitch, the 38-year-old\u2019s traumatic 2016 robbery in Paris is being adapted into a film.\n\nTentatively titled Fashion Week, the film is based on an upcoming 130-page graphic novel by French writer and director Joann Sfar. Speaking to Variety, Joann said that the film would explore \u201cviolence against women, the relationship between the very rich people and the less rich, the world of fashion and the encounter between figures of new and old worlds\u201d.\n\nRather than centre on Kardashian \u2013 or someone resembling her \u2013 the film will focus on a group of thieves who plot to rob a rich and famous influencer only to end up caught in the whirlwind of fashion week in Paris. It\u2019s said to be funny too.\n\nWhile Joann has said that the film will only be \u201cliberally based on the raid on Kim Kardashian\u201d, it\u2019s unclear how involved \u2013 if at all \u2013 Kim and her family are in the project. But given the impact the IRL incident had, they may want to be.\n\nSpeaking in the aftermath of the robbery, which saw the reality star-turned-law-student tied up and held at gunpoint in her hotel room while $10 million worth of jewellery was stolen, Kim has said she feared for her life during the incident, and there were reports that she was experiencing PTSD.\n\nIn a recent episode of E! True Hollywood Story, she said: \u201cIt was the scariest thing I've ever been through in my entire life, just thinking that, you know, you're about to die. You're just kind of bracing yourself for the moment that they're going to shoot you and kill you. That 10 minutes really changed my whole life.\u201d Eleven people have since been charged in connection to the robbery, which France24 have dubbed \u201cthe biggest heist of one individual in France in two decades\u201d.\n\nGiven how traumatic the incident was, it would be reaching to suggest that the Kardashian/Jenners might not be too pleased about the film, although they have yet to respond. Either way, whether there\u2019s drama or not, it will all probably make for an interesting episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "The film is tentatively titled \u2018Fashion Week\u2019 and is based on a graphic novel.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da70abddf4e600009d579ad/lede/1571228723926-Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-132351.png?crop=0.9854xw:0.984xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
