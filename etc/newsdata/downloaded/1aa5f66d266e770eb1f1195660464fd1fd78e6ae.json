It had been Baa3, Moody\u2019s lowest investment grade rating.\n\nThe credit rating agency said it expects Ford\u2019s restructuring to extend for several years and include $11 billion in charges and a $7 billion cash cost.\n\nFord\u2019s outlook remains stable, but its cash flow and profit margins are below Moody\u2019s expectations and also below those of peer companies in the auto industry, the agency said.\n\n\u201cThese measures are likely to remain weak through the 2020/2021 period including a lengthy period of negative cash flow from the restructuring programs,\u201d Moody\u2019s Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance Bruce Clark wrote in a note to investors released after the markets closed Monday.\n\nFord\u2019s erosion in performance happened while the global auto industry was healthy, Clark noted. Now the company and CEO Jim Hackett must address operational problems as demand for vehicles is softening in major markets, he wrote.\n\nThe company has $23.2 billion in cash, which is more than its debt, according to Moody\u2019s. The stable outlook reflects Moody\u2019s expectation that the restructuring will contribute to gradual improvement in earnings, profit margins and cash generation, Clark wrote.\n\nFord said it has plenty of liquidity to invest in its future.\n\n\u201cWe are making significant progress on a comprehensive global redesign - reinvigorating our product lineup and aggressively restructuring our businesses around the world,\u201d Ford\u2019s statement said. It added that Ford already is addressing operating inefficiencies and problems with its China business.\n\nShares of Ford fell more than 3% to $9.22 in after-hours trading.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Moody's Investors Service on Monday downgraded Ford's credit rating to junk status, citing expectations that the automaker will be weighed by weak earnings and cash generation as it pursues a costly restructuring plan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/04/25/earns_ford_80486_c0-89-2115-1322_s1770x1032.jpg?344adeabf28eb92888d6c71af0331691c8eb06fa", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
