REUTERS/Leah Millis//File Photo\n\nThe central bank said it conducted an overnight repo operation, resulting in a $53.15 billion boost in cash into the banking system.\n\nThe Fed will hold another repo operation early Wednesday.\n\nIn an overnight repo operation, banks borrow cash from the Fed using Treasuries and other securities as collateral. Repo operations have been rare in recent years because banks have had ample supply of available cash for daily operations.\n\nThe temporary shortage of cash was due to quarterly corporate tax payments and the settlement of $78 billion in supply of Treasuries sold last week, analysts said.\n\nThe chaos in money markets since Monday added to Fed policymakers\u2019 list of concerns that is already heavy on risks from U.S.-China trade tensions, a weakening global economy and sluggish domestic inflation.\n\nFed officials began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and are widely expected to cut the central bank\u2019s policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe surge in borrowing costs, which banks and Wall Street pay to raise cash to fund their trades and loans, also exposed cracks in money markets left by the Fed\u2019s normalization of its massive balance sheet that ended in July, analysts said.\n\nThe central bank amassed holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities during three rounds of quantitative easing (QE) after the financial crisis. Reduction of those holdings was at least partly responsible for a nearly $900 billion decline in bank reserves since 2017.\n\n\u201cThe root cause is the shortage of reserves,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York. \u201cThis is a funding squeeze.\u201d\n\n(GRAPHIC: Bank excess reserves held at the Fed - here)\n\nSURGING MONEY RATES\n\nAt one point on Tuesday, overnight borrowing costs in the $2.2 trillion repurchase agreement market spiked to as high as 10%.\n\nIn the repo market, banks and Wall Street dealers use securities as collateral to obtain cash from money market funds and other cash investors.\n\nAnother alarming signal was a jump in the average federal funds rate, which the central bank aims to influence. It reached 2.25% on Monday, which matched the upper end of the Fed\u2019s current target range and was a move not seen since the height of global credit crisis more than a decade ago.\n\nAnalysts attributed for the spike on Monday in repo rates.\n\nCompounding this precarious backdrop was likely a flood of Treasuries dumped on dealers due to last week\u2019s dramatic global bond market sell-off, analysts said.\n\nFED TO THE RESCUE\n\nBy early Tuesday, there were no signs cash had returned to money markets.\n\n\u201cThis increased the pressure on the Fed to doing something,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nThe Fed embarked on a move it last deployed on a large-scale since 2008 during the height of the global credit crisis. Repo rates dropped to zero after the Fed announcement before ending the day at about 2.0%, analysts said.\n\nNow, analysts expect the Fed to do more to calm money markets including a standing repo facility, a decrease on what it pays on excessive reserves and/or an increase of its purchases of Treasuries.\n\nRelated Coverage N.Y. Fed to hold repo operation Wednesday\n\nJeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, told Reuters that the Fed will embark \u201cpretty soon\u201d on \u201cQE lite,\u201d in order to increase the money supply and spur lending and investment.\n\n(GRAPHIC: U.S. repo rate - here)", "description": "The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday injected billions of dollars into the financial system with a move it has not used in more than a decade to calm money markets, as lending dwindled partly due to huge payments for taxes and bond supply.", "authors": ["Richard Leong", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430976253&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1SA", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
