Anwar's trial in the case is ongoing.\n\nKarachi police say the raids were justified operations against militants.\n\nThe closing of Suleman's exhibition on Sunday drew nationwide condemnation from fellow artists and human rights activists who say it was yet another attempt to censor criticism in Pakistan.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
