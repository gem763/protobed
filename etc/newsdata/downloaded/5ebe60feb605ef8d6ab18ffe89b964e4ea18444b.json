REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/Files\n\nTotal is the third foreign oil major to enter India\u2019s gas sector after BP Plc (BP.L) and Shell (RDSa.L), and it comes at a time when India is spending heavily to cut its carbon emissions.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to more than double the share of gas in the country\u2019s energy basket to 15% by 2030, while Total has embarked on a series of deals this year to expand its liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolio.\n\nTotal will buy up to 25.2% in Adani Gas from public shareholders at 149.63 rupees per share, representing an 8.7% premium to the stock\u2019s last close and valuing the stake at 41.47 billion rupees ($585 million).\n\nIt will also buy another 12.2% stake from the Adani family at an undisclosed price, according to stock exchange filings.\n\nAfter the deal, the Adani family and Total will each hold 37.4% stake in Adani Gas, while public shareholders will own the remaining 25.2%.\n\nShares of Adani Gas soared 18.4% on Monday after the deal was announced, while the broader NSE index .NSE rose 0.3% in early trade.\n\n\u201cThe natural gas market in India will have strong growth and is an attractive outlet for the world\u2019s second-largest LNG player that Total has become,\u201d Total Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAdani will bring its knowledge of the local market and its expertise in the infrastructure and energy sectors. This partnership with Adani is cornerstone to our development strategy in this country,\u201d added Pouyann\u00e9.\n\nTotal and Adani plan to establish a joint venture to market LNG in India and Bangladesh.\n\nSpeaking later at a conference in New Delhi, Pouyann\u00e9 said the deal will take 6 months to complete, adding that the energy major was looking to capture a substantial part of the Indian gas market with Adani.\n\nTotal was also in discussions with partners including Adani for partnership in renewable energy, he said at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek.\n\nLast month, Total completed the acquisition of Anadarko\u2019s APC.N 26.5% stake in the Mozambique LNG project for $3.9 billion, while in June it took over Toshiba\u2019s (6502.T) U.S. LNG business.", "description": "French energy giant Total SA will buy a 37.4% stake in Indian gas distribution company Adani Gas , as it looks to capitalise on the South Asian country's push for cleaner sources of energy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440578689&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D070", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
