REUTERS/Joyce Lee\n\n\u201cKim Ji-young, Born 1982\u201d - based on a 2016 book of the same name - opened in South Korea last week and immediately highlighted divisions within the country over sexism, the anti-harassment #MeToo movement, and feminism.\n\nThe story follows a married woman in her 30s who feels forced by social circumstances and opinions to give up her work and dreams in order to raise her young child.\n\nThe movie has been No. 1 at the South Korean box office since opening a week ago and had sold 9.7 billion won ($8.3 million) in tickets by Sunday, according to the latest data from the Korean Film Council.\n\nA number of women in the audience were audibly crying at a screening in a small central Seoul theater on Tuesday.\n\nSeo Mi-jeong, a 23-year-old woman who was among those in tears during the screening, said the movie seemed less zealously \u201cfeminist\u201d than simply a realistic portrayal of the challenges women face.\n\n\u201cAlthough there were some parts that seemed exaggerated for storytelling, it touched on realities in South Korean society that keep women of different generations from the life they wanted to lead,\u201d she said.\n\nThe movie has highlighted stark gender divides, including the growing number of young South Korean men who think feminism and the #MeToo movement have outlived their usefulness.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t empathize with the premise that a woman born in 1982 was discriminated against when she was growing up,\u201d said Kim Won-koo, a 29-year-old man who saw it on opening day. \u201cMany of the situations seem unrealistic or very, very rare.\u201d\n\nWomen rated the film an average of 9.5 out of 10 stars on Naver, South Korea\u2019s top web search portal, while men gave it an average of 2.5 stars.\n\nPart of its box office success appears to come from South Korean women buying tickets in support of a cause without actually going to the cinema, many social media posts indicate, a practice known in South Korea as \u201csending one\u2019s soul\u201d.\n\nIn a survey of 1,000 single South Koreans aged between 19 and 44 by pollster Realmeter in September, 81.2% of respondents said gender conflict was a serious issue in South Korea.\n\nSouth Korea has seen both feminist and men\u2019s \u201creverse-discrimination\u201d debates grow in recent years as the #MeToo movement ensnared a number of high-profile political, entertainment, religious and sports figures accused of harassment or abuse.", "description": "A movie based on a controversial and best-selling novel that chronicled the everyday sexism faced by women topped South Korea's box office this week, reigniting a national debate over women's roles in an historically male-dominated society.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446459271&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0EB", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
