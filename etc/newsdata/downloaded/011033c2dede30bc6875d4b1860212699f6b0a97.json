REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\n\nStevens did not hold the town hall in her home district to discuss House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry of Trump, but to discuss tighter gun laws, perhaps the one issue that is just as divisive in American politics.\n\nBut impeachment came up anyway.\n\nWearing Trump hats and camouflage and carrying holstered handguns, many of his supporters said Democrats have gone too far by opening the impeachment probe over a whistleblower complaint that Trump solicited Ukraine\u2019s help in smearing Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already put him (Trump) through the wringer. They\u2019re just clutching at straws,\u201d said Marti Carroll, 61, a bookkeeper and photographer who lives in the Commerce Township, a northern suburb of Detroit, as gunshots rang out from the nearby range.\n\nCongressional Democrats such as Stevens fanned out to their home districts this week for a two-week recess to explain their decision to pursue the impeachment probe.\n\nStevens, 36, won the 2018 election in a district that Trump carried two years earlier to replace a retiring Republican, one of the 41 net gains that helped Democrats regain control of the House for the first time since 2011.\n\nShe was one of the last House Democrats who came out in support of impeachment last week, tipping House Speaker Nancy Pelosi toward a move she had been reluctant to make for months. That has also made Stevens a top Republican target.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a political action committee that favors Republicans, has taken aim at several freshman House Democrats, including Stevens, in online ads that accuses them of siding with party\u2019s left wing as represented by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nTalking to Reuters after the town hall, Stevens said she found the prospect of impeachment \u201calarming\u201d and \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\nBut, she said, \u201cwe cannot be divided on the rule of law.\u201d\n\nTrump won Michigan in 2016 by just 10,704 votes, and his campaign believes he must carry the state again next year in the presidential election to secure a second term.\n\nGabriel Costanzo, a Republican member of the city council in nearby Walled Lake, said that he likes the congresswoman personally, but that she went too far in supporting the inquiry.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not governing from the middle,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cImpeachment pushed a lot of people over the edge with her.\u201d\n\nDespite the risks and the possibility that any House action would fail in the Republican-controlled Senate, some Democrats at the event said they could not ignore the president\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they can help but pursue it - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an option,\u201d said Rick Goldberg, 66, a Democrat and retired assistant deputy warden at a correctional facility, who lives in Livonia, Michigan. \u201cBut the Senate\u2019s not going to do anything with it.\u201d\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday showed that the number of Americans who believe Trump should be impeached rose 8 percentage points to 45% over the past week as more people learned about the Ukraine allegations.\n\nThe increase was mostly attributable to Democrats, 74% of whom said Trump should be impeached. Underscoring the partisan nature of the issue, only 13% of Republicans said they supported impeachment.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of House Democrats support the impeachment inquiry. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u2018JUMPING THE GUN\u2019\n\nRegardless of the data, some Democrats worry their party may have entered perilous territory.\n\nIn last year\u2019s midterm elections, they re-took the House largely by appealing to suburban moderate voters on issues such as health care and not focusing on Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nDemocrats hold a 38-seat edge over Republicans in the chamber. Next year, every House member will face re-election.\n\nAt a Monday town hall in Oklahoma City, Kendra Horn, another first-year Democratic congresswoman, explained her choice to not support the probe.\n\nTrump won her district by about 13 percentage points.\n\n\u201cVery clearly, I think these are serious allegations that should be investigated. I did not think it was necessary to move into an impeachment inquiry to do so, but now the horse is out of the barn,\u201d Horn told reporters.\n\nKatie Hill, a Democratic freshman from California who flipped a Republican-held seat in the 2018 midterms, held a telephone town hall with her constituents on Tuesday evening.\n\nShe opened her remarks by explaining why she backed impeachment, telling the audience that her mom is a Democrat and her dad is a Republican.\n\n\u201cIt is the toughest decision that I have had to make since taking this office, and it is one that I only made when it became very clear that our security and our democracy were jeopardized,\u201d Hill said.\n\nHer staff also asked callers to answer a poll question on the call: \u201cDo you support the investigation of President Trump\u2019s conversation with the leader of Ukraine with regard to a political opponent?\u201d Callers were asked to press 1 for yes, and 2 for no.\n\nOne caller said she opposed impeachment, because it \u201cwill divide the country.\u201d She asked Hill: \u201cWhy are you jumping the gun?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a coup,\u201d Hill replied. \u201cI would like to make it perfectly clear, if a Democratic president was in the White House, I would act in exactly the same way. I want to assure you there is no jumping to conclusions.\u201d\n\nLauren Underwood, a first-year congresswoman who represents a suburb outside Chicago, was unequivocal after holding a town hall on Tuesday night with about 60 people, including two dozen teenagers, on vaping.\n\n\u201cThe idea of our president could have committed a betrayal of his office in this way... it is outrageous, it is so bad and it is disgusting,\u201d Underwood said after the event at the Naperville Public Library.\n\nHer supporters said the same as they left.\n\n\u201cI think they should have done it a long time ago,\u201d Joe Holt, a 71-year-old retiree from Naperville, Illinois, said after the forum. \u201cThis latest thing... I am just shocked how this is coming out.\u201d", "description": "Speaking before a rowdy and divided crowd of about 200 at an indoor shooting range Tuesday evening, first-term House Democratic Congresswoman Haley Stevens from Michigan faced angry Republican voters who lashed out at her party's push for gun control - as well as its treatment of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436221090&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910WD"}
