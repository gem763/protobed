Many suffer from insomnia and have nightmares. To those in the bank, whether bank staff or customers, he must have appeared a fearsome sight.\n\nIn probation reports, he was referred to as a 'villain from the old school', who prided himself on being honest, stating he was a 'villain not a liar'.\n\nHe claimed he robbed because he felt it was more honourable way to live than taking government benefits.\n\nGreen was named by Australian police as a suspect in the death of Australians Bernard Gray and Maria Fiore, who had links to the Mr Asia drug syndicate.\n\nThe pair disappeared after having dinner with him while he was in Sydney.\n\nUp until his death, he remained a police interest as they still hoped to solve a number of murders linked to Mr Asia, according to Stuff.\n\nNew Zealand Police also had 'little doubt' he was involved in the disappearance of Marion Granville who vanished in Naenae in 1980.\n\nBut, he was never formally interviewed on the case as there was no evidence to charge him.\n\nGreen had kept to himself since he was placed on parole in 2006- having served what was at the time the longest sentence for armed robbery.", "description": "An infamous bank robber that held the title of New Zealand's 'most wanted criminal' throughout the 90s has died aged 82.", "authors": ["Tita Smith For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/07/20168436-0-image-a-2_1571985575140.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
