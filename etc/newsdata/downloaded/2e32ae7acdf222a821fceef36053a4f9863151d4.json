Whether it\u2019s new starters, new schools or new coaches, year-over-year change seems to have energized every situation.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s coincidence, or simply the product of a small sample size of two games. But one thing is clear: substantive change is not necessarily an impediment to success. This might also be emblematic of the constant shifting sands of college football, and why the ability to adapt \u2014 as a player, a coach or an entire program \u2014 is an increasingly prized commodity:\n\nJalen Hurts (11), Oklahoma. What\u2019s new: school. For three years, Hurts was a capable and at times very good quarterback at Alabama. For two games under Lincoln Riley, he looks phenomenal. Hurts is your national leader in efficiency with a rating of 252.39, which is better than either Baker Mayfield (227.31) or Kyler Murray (193.76) produced during the first two games of their Heisman Trophy seasons. Oh, and Hurts also has rushed for more than 200 yards and three touchdowns, far outstripping his Heisman predecessors in that area. Now, it\u2019s true that both Mayfield and Murray played a Power Five opponent within those first two weeks, while Hurts has feasted upon Houston and South Dakota, so let\u2019s wait and see how that goes. But for now, my goodness.\n\nThe nation's most efficient quarterbacks thus far have all experienced major change since last season, led by Oklahoma's Jalen Hurts. (Getty)\n\nStory continues\n\nJoe Burrow (12), LSU. What\u2019s new: passing game coordinator. The Joe Brady arrival and revival has transformed Burrow from a scatter-shooting thrower with modest accuracy and moderate explosiveness into the No. 2 efficiency QB in America at present (219.11). Accuracy is up 24 percent year-over-year, and yards per attempt has ballooned from 7.6 to 11.3. Burrow has thrown nine touchdown passes thus far \u2014 it took him 10 games to throw that many in 2018. The 29-year-old Brady worked the previous two years for the Saints under Sean Payton, and before that was at Penn State with James Franklin.\n\nAnthony Gordon (13), Washington State. What\u2019s new: role as starter. A lot of people expected the heir to Gardner Minshew to be Eastern Washington transfer Gage Gubrud. Instead, Gordon won the job and has proceeded to produce customary Leach-level numbers: a 218.86 efficiency rating, third in FBS, and 442 passing yards per game, second in FBS. What Gordon has not done is face a decent defense, having played New Mexico State and Northern Colorado. Now a Houston unit that Hurts annihilated is up next on Friday.\n\nSean Clifford (14), Penn State. What\u2019s new: role as starter. Clifford was sought by plenty of Division I programs out of Cincinnati St. Xavier, but not many bluebloods. Penn State landed him, redshirted him and then he played sparingly behind Trace McSorley and Red Zone bulldozer Tommy Stevens. But Stevens transferred after not being guaranteed the starting job following spring practice, and Clifford became The Guy. And so far The Guy has been on fire against admittedly soft competition. With a rating of 215.01 after ripping Idaho and Buffalo, Clifford is far ahead of where McSorley stood two starts into his Penn State career (141.43). Pittsburgh should provide a tougher test Saturday.\n\nSpencer Sanders (15), Oklahoma State. What\u2019s new: role as starter. Sanders redshirted last year and has become an instant standout this year, the latest in Mike Gundy\u2019s line of highly productive quarterbacks. Sanders was great in his debut game, on the road against Oregon State, then tore up FCS McNeese State in Week Two. It helps having the great Tylan Wallace as a target (10 catches, 272 yards, five touchdowns thus far), but Sanders also can run the ball (160 rushing yards, 109 of them against the Beavers).\n\nTua Tagovailoa (16), Alabama. What\u2019s new: offensive coordinator. Staff turnover has been a survivable constant for years in Tuscaloosa, but the loss of Mike Locksley after he coordinated the best offense in school history seemed potentially problematic. So far, so good under Steve Sarkisian. Tagovailoa has thrown 20 more passes through two games than last year (probably because the Crimson Tide struggled to run in the opener against Duke) with similar efficiency \u2014 the rating was 231.49 at this point in 2018, 204.34 in 2019.\n\nNick Saban's still around, but Tua Tagovailoa (13) has thrived under new offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian. (Getty)\n\nDillon Gabriel (17), Central Florida. What\u2019s new: true freshman starter. Last Saturday, Gabriel became UCF\u2019s fourth different starter in the last five games. From McKenzie Milton to Darriel Mack Jr., to Notre Dame transfer Brandon Wimbush to Gabriel, change has been a constant at that position. Gabriel, who was recruited by both USC and Georgia, opted to follow Milton to Orlando from Hawaii. UCF coach Josh Heupel said he started Gabriel over Wimbush against Florida Atlantic because Wimbush wasn\u2019t 100 percent, and Gabriel certainly produced some big plays \u2014 245 passing yards on just seven completions, two of them easy throws for long touchdowns. There will be some intrigue surrounding who gets the start Saturday in one of UCF\u2019s biggest home games ever, when Stanford visits.\n\nJustin Fields (18), Ohio State. What\u2019s new: school. The Georgia transfer has been an immediate hit in Ryan Day\u2019s offense, cranking out one touchdown for every eight times he\u2019s run or passed the ball. Fields has been highly accurate (76 percent completion rate) while avoiding mistakes (zero interceptions in 50 attempts). After a season with pocket passer Dwayne Haskins, Fields returns the quarterback run element to the Ohio State offense. Fields isn\u2019t likely to come anywhere near Haskins\u2019 533 passing attempts of 2018, but he could easily run it 10-15 times a game.\n\nKedon Slovis (19), USC. What\u2019s new: true freshman starter, new coordinator. Approximately nobody foresaw Slovis starting and starring for the Trojans in his second college game, but that\u2019s what happened Saturday night. A moderately recruited three-star prospect out of Arizona, new USC coordinator Graham Harrell liked Slovis right away and elevated him to second string ahead of two more experienced backups to J.T. Daniels. When Daniels went down in the season opener with a torn ACL, the job fell to Slovis. He then sliced up Stanford for 377 yards and three touchdowns, completing 85 percent of his throws. Three of the next four games are on the road, and the home game is against perhaps the Pac-12\u2019s best team in Utah, so we\u2019re going to find out more about Slovis\u2019 mettle rather quickly.\n\nAnthony Brown (20), Boston College. What\u2019s new: offensive coordinator. Mike Bajakian arrived from the NFL as the Eagles\u2019 new play caller, and he\u2019s made a tight end-friendly offense even more reliant on that position. Four tight ends have made 11 of BC\u2019s 24 receptions in two games, with running backs contributing another four catches (three by star back AJ Dillon, including the longest reception of his career). Meanwhile, Brown utilized wideouts Kobay White and Zay Jones to hit big plays against Virginia Tech in the opener. Brown\u2019s yards per attempt have jumped from 7.4 last year to 11.3 thus far this year.\n\nDue to numerical constraints, The Dash has to cut the list there. But the next four in the pass efficiency ratings also have something new about them. In order:\n\nSkylar Thompson, Kansas State. What\u2019s new: head coach, offensive coordinator.\n\nAnthony Russo, Temple. What\u2019s new: head coach, offensive coordinator.\n\nJack Coan, Wisconsin. What\u2019s new: role as starter.\n\nSam Howell, North Carolina. What\u2019s new: true freshman starter.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "From Oklahoma's Jalen Hurts to Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa and everyone in between, change has energized college football's top passers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_GJ4Bff2PfuZXSz52ppMWw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ULlC8hWl81Wj2POsFtgPnA--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6b3f6c00-d325-11e9-a5da-7975b31e15a9", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
