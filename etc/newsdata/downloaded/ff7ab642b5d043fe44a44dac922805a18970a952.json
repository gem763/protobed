Meanwhile, futures for the S&P 500 index ESU19, +0.13% were up 3.75 points, or 0.1%, at 3,005.75, while the Nasdaq-100 NQU19, +0.37% were gaining 23.75 points, or 0.3%, at 7,913.50.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dow DJIA, +0.85% rose 227.61 points, or 0.9%, to 27,137.04, closing above 27,000 for the first time since July. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.72% advanced 21.54 points, or 0.7%, to 3,000.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.06% gained 85.52 points, or 1.1%, to 8,169.67.\n\nWednesday\u2019s action left the Dow and S&P just 0.8% from their record closes, while the Nasdaq remains 1.9% from its all-time closing high.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nTrump said tariff hikes\u2014from 25% to 30%\u2014that were scheduled to take effect Oct. 1 will now go into effect Oct. 15. The president attributed the \u201cgesture of goodwill\u201d, as he described it via Twitter, to the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s 70th anniversary commencing on Oct. 1. and came at the request of China\u2019s chief trade negotiator Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nThe moves comes as American and Chinese representatives are slated to meet in early October to restart stalled trade negotiations and avert any further escalation of animosities between the economic superpowers.\n\nHowever, no date has been set to begin the high-level discussions, but the latest olive branch does help to reflect a momentary softening of tensions between Beijing and Washington, which had rattled global economies, because an outright trade war could further weaken an already slowing global economy.\n\nBeyond trade, markets are focused on ECB President Mario Draghi, who will preside over his penultimate policy meeting as head of Europe\u2019s rate-setting organization. Most economists and market participants anticipate that the ECB could further reduce rates, deepening the eurozone\u2019s slide into rates that offer yields of less than 0%. The ECB may also deliver a new asset-buying program, and could also attempt to mitigate its easy-money moves to the broader financial community. In particular, the ECB could introduce a so-called tiered system of deposits, which would see only a portion of deposits subject to negative rates.\n\nThe ECB will announce its decision at 7:45 a.m. Eastern Time, followed by a news conference with Draghi at 8:30 a.m. Economists at Goldman Sachs said most of the measures will be revealed in the announcement, rather than the Draghi press conference.\n\nRead: The ECB\u2019s challenge: Pushing rates further into negative territory without wrecking eurozone banks\n\nCheck out: The ECB decision is coming\u2014here\u2019s what to expect\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of Oracle Corp. ORCL, +1.48% are in focus after the technology company late Wednesday said co-CEO Mark Hurd was taking a leave of absence for health reasons. Co-CEO Safra Catz and Chairman Larry Ellison will cover Hurd\u2019s duties, the company said. Oracle shares were down 1.9% in premarket trade Thursday.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.14% fell 1 basis point to 1.72% Thursday. Bond prices move inversely to yields.\n\nIn commodity markets, the price of crude oil CLV19, -0.90% was off 1% at $55.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling more than 2% on Wednesday amid reports that Trump discussed easing of sanctions on Iran in a move to secure a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani later this month.\n\nGold prices GCZ19, +0.51% headed 0.5% higher to $1,510 an ounce. The U.S. dollar DXY, -0.13%, meanwhile, edged 0.1% lower to 98.55, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of six currencies.\n\nIn Asia overnight Thursday, the China CSI 300 l 000300, +1.08% gained 1.1%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index HSI, -0.26% shed 0.3% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, +0.75% rose 0.8%.
