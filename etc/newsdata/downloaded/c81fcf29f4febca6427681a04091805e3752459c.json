Meanwhile, Chinese managers lament the Americans\u2019 complaints (\u201cthey have fat fingers,\u201d one says on camera), while the Americans make an all-out push to unionize for better pay and conditions.\n\nEven as the percentage of Americans in unions has been trending downward, support for unions is nearing a half-century high. That\u2019s emerged on the campaign trail, where 2020 Democrats are reaching out to unions and showing that they have Big Ideas (TM) to jumpstart the labor movement. Campaign workers for four 2020 aspirants have unionized themselves\u2014the first time that\u2019s ever happened in any presidential campaign.\n\nRead more about how campaigns are talking about unions here.\n\nRead our culture writer\u2019s review of American Factory here.\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai\n\n*\n\nAll the President\u2019s Tempers\n\nOn peace talks with the Taliban: Over the weekend, President Trump announced that he was calling off what he claimed was a secret invitation for Taliban leaders to seal a peace deal at Camp David. Publicly, the White House blamed the killing of an American soldier in Kabul last week as a key reason talks collapsed, but the writing was already on the wall, Uri Friedman and Kathy Gilsinan write.\n\nOn his go-to cable network, Fox News: The president\u2019s complaints about media coverage took a slightly unexpected turn recently when he lashed out at Fox News for \u201cheavily promoting Democrats,\u201d but the criticism from the commander-in-chief hardly registered a reaction from the cable news network, Elaina Plott and Peter Nicholas report: \u201cThere\u2019s honestly been no acknowledgement of them,\u201d one Fox staffer told them.\n\n*\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 2020 Watch\n\nA (in)convenient truth: The best, most substantive discussion of how to address climate change: we saw it last week when 10 Democratic presidential hopefuls detailed the nuances of their policy proposals in a seven-hour marathon on CNN, Robinson Meyer writes. The event was evidence that the American political left has reshaped the country\u2019s climate conversation \u2014 and a reminder that even some seemingly lofty proposals could become a reality (see: 2008\u2019s individual-mandate debate)\n\nThe rise of the insurgent left shouldn\u2019t scare Democrats: And it especially need not scare Elizabeth Warren, Peter Beinart argues. The Massachusetts progressive\u2019s \u201cgo big\u201d message hearkens back to Barack Obama\u2019s own message of hope and political bravery, when he was battling Hillary Clinton in the primary.\n\n*\n\n\ud83d\uddd3 The Week Ahead\n\n\u2023 Monday, Sept. 9: Congress is back in session. Watch for potential movement on gun-control, what happens now after a summer recess that didn\u2019t seem to move the impeachment-inquiry needle, and more.\n\n\u2023 Tuesday, Sept. 10: Welcome to the \u201cdo-over\u201d election in North Carolina\u2019s Ninth District\u2014the country\u2019s last unsettled congressional race from 2018.", "description": "What really prompted the president to call off Afghan peace talks?
