Meanwhile, the younger generation believe in fighting for their freedom.\n\nAs the protests grow, so do the staunch divides within families like mine.\n\nWhen the protests began, they were about vehement disapproval of a law that would allow for the extradition of people from Hong Kong to China to face trial for their crimes. Many argued that this would have consequences for Hong Kong\u2019s freedom. Now, the movement has evolved \u2013 it\u2019s about the running of the Hong Kong government, police brutality, and China\u2019s \u2018control\u2019 over the city as a whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe protests have mostly had major support from the people of Hong Kong, with one pro-democracy and anti-Extradition Amendment Bill Movement (anti-ELAB) rally gaining a turnout of 1.7 million people in August \u2013 nearly 25 per cent of the entire population. People all over the world have also used the hashtag #Stand WithHK to show their support, as well as participating in solidarity rallies and protests in cities like Vancouver, Toronto, Sydney and London.\n\nBut, much like Brexit in the UK, this is an issue that has divided families. Even though the movement seems to have a lot of support, disagreements have sprung up, usually between parents and children surrounding the latter\u2019s participation in the protests.\n\nMany of the parents who oppose the movement are largely ignoring the multiple cases of police brutality and violence that have occurred in the last few months (Picture: Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMy family has been no different. Growing up in Hong Kong in the early 00s, with the legacy of Britain still woven into the fabric of the city, I was in favour of Hong Kong\u2019s independence and the specific cultural elements that made us unique compared to mainland China. Even now, living in Britain and returning to visit Hong Kong once or twice a year, I am firm in my belief that there is a stark difference between Hong Kong and China.\n\nBut my family, who are all in their 60s or older, are more fond of China\u2019s influence, despite witnessing first hand the effect it can have on our city. They believe it comes with many benefits, such as financial input into the city, as well as protection from any world powers who may seek to exploit Hong Kong as Britain once did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne anonymous Hong Kong-er in her 20s told me that some of her family members \u2018are against the protests because they think we are just disrupting Hong Kong, and that the extradition bill won\u2019t affect us as long as we don\u2019t break the law, which clearly is not the case\u2019.\n\nShe says this has caused \u2018quite a few arguments from time to time during dinner\u2019, but she is \u2018trying to change their minds [by] providing more facts about the bill\u2026 and about the police brutality\u2019.\n\nAnother young Hong Kong-er told me that while his family \u2018support the movement\u2019, they \u2018disagree with some of the methods [being used] to achieve what we want\u2019.\n\nHe participates on the front line of the protests as a first aider, and said, \u2018My mum doesn\u2019t want me to be out there because it\u2019s so dangerous with the police. I\u2019ve been shot at and searched by the police. It\u2019s caused multiple arguments between myself and my mum\u2019.\n\nA mum being concerned for her son\u2019s safety is completely understandable, but it is crucial to remember that her fears stem from how he will be treated by the police, rather than the movement itself.\n\nIt is disheartening to see our own families counter-protesting and strongly opposing every effort to fight for what we believe is right\n\nHowever, many of the parents who oppose the movement are largely ignoring the multiple cases of police brutality and violence that have occurred in the last few months. It is estimated that 1,800 rounds of tear gas had been fired by the Hong Kong police as of August 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe police have also used rubber bullets, one of which hit a woman\u2019s eye and blinded her. The rallies against police brutality have often been met with counter-protests in support of the police, and many of the attendees of these skew towards the older demographic.\n\nMy uncle was even in attendance at one counter-protest rally, bearing a sign that said (in Chinese): \u2018I support the Hong Kong police. You can hit me if you want!\u2019\n\nThis slogan has been a rallying cry against any reported incidents of police brutality, arguing that the police are \u2018just doing their jobs\u2019 and that it is in fact the protesters who have been causing the violence.\n\nIt is disheartening to see our own families counter-protesting and strongly opposing every effort to fight for what we believe is right. This largely youth-led movement needs support from across the generational divide if we are to succeed in our aims.\n\nCurrently, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an easy answer as to how we can bridge that gap \u2013 but we need to stop it from widening. Supporters of the anti-ELAB movement need to have honest conversations with ourselves, and with the opposition we face within our own families, so we can have some hope of reaching a middle ground.\n\nIf we continue to fight, without attempting to understand the other side, Hong Kong is doomed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Don\u2019t be fooled by the \u2018progress\u2019 in Hong Kong \u2013 the struggle is far from over\n\nMORE: In this critical hour for democracy we must stand with Hong Kong\n\nMORE: Brexit has made Britain an angrier place (and we\u2019re falling out with family and friends over it)", "description": "The fight for democracy and anti-police brutality protests in Hong Kong are revealing a generational divide.", "authors": ["Michele Theil", "London-Based Freelance Journalist"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177214856_1571662295.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
