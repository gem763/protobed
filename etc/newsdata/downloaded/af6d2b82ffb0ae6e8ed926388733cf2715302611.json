All facets of your team have to fire,\" said Kohli.\n\nThe series saw Indian batsmen Mayank Agarwal (215), Kohli (254 not out) and Rohit Sharma (212) all hit double tons against South Africa.\n\nAfter big wins in the first two tests in Visakhapatnam and Pune, fast bowlers Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav again battered South Africa in Ranchi, this time taking 10 wickets between them.\n\n\"The catching has been brilliant as well. It's great to see when you operate in such a way,\" said Kohli.\n\n\"We believe we can win anywhere in the world. England, Australia, South Africa - good things are going to follow,\" he vowed.\n\nSouth Africa captain Faf du Plessis was left frustrated and despondent by the defeat.\n\nHe said the team had shown \"good signs\" at the start of the first Test, \"but we went the other way and kept making more mistakes as the series went on.\n\n\"You got to give credit to the Indian team. This is a really tough Indian team under Virat,\" he added.\n\n\"Be it in the batting, bowling or even fielding, we were dominated across the series.\"\n\nDu Plessis said India's fast bowlers had performed throughout the three matches.\n\n\"Our seamers were good for 30-40 minutes but theirs were able to do that throughout the day.\"\n\n\"It has been a really tough series for us but we need to ensure that when we tour again, we are better equipped. This is the toughest place to tour, the statistics say that.\"\n\nDe Bruyn came in to the South African XI in place of Dean Elgar, who was hit on the helmet and concussed by a short paced Umesh Yadav delivery on Monday.\n\nThe left-hander had to retire hurt and is now under observation.\n\nAnrich Nortje received a hit on the arm on the final ball of the match after Ngidi's shot hit him and then went to Nadeem for a return catch.\n\nIndia are scheduled to host Bangladesh for two Tests and three Twenty20 internationals starting November 3. But the tour is under threat as the Bangladesh players have gone on strike over payments.", "description": "India beat South Africa by an innings and 202 runs in the third Test to sweep the series 3-0 in Ranchi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2721/cc8fd78f54864b3e9893c3547b589750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
