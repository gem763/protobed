United bests Timbers for second straight road win", "language": "en", "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 An own goal put D.C. United up in the 24th minute and the team held on for a 1-0 victory over the Portland Timbers on Sunday.\n\nIt was United\u2019s second straight win after a three-game losing streak, with both victories coming on the road.\n\nUnited (12-10-9) was denied another goal before halftime. Television replays appeared to show the ball cross the goal line before Timbers midfielder Eryk Williamson cleared it out.\n\nThe loss snapped a two-game winning streak for the Timbers (13-12-4). It was the Portland\u2019s fourth loss at home, most since the 2012 season.\n\nWayne Rooney returned to United\u2019s starting lineup after a two-game suspension for violent conduct in the 21st minute of a match against the Red Bulls on Aug. 21. Rooney leads the team with 11 goals and seven assists in 26 league appearances this season. The striker will leave United at the end of the season to become a player-coach for Derby County in England.\n\nUnited was coming off a 3-0 road victory over the Montreal Impact, while Portland\u2019s last result was a 2-1 win at home over Sporting Kansas City.\n\nThe Timbers played a depleted squad against United with only 16 players available. Sebastian Blanco was nursing a lower leg injury while top scorer Brian Fernandez was out because of an illness. Defender Zarek Valentin was absent because of the birth of his child.\n\nUnited went ahead on the own goal when Portland defender Bill Tuiloma tried unsuccessfully to clear a cross from Ulises Segura. A second goal was denied in the 38th minute when Rooney\u2019s corner into the box bounced off Portland goalkeeper Steve Clark but was booted out of the goal by Williamson. United players pleaded that the ball crossed the goal line but the referee did not go to a video review and allowed play to continue.\n\nPortland had a number of chances. Diego Valeri\u2019s header in the 16th minute for the Timbers hit the post then skidded across the front of the goal. Jorge Moreira lofted a shot from distance in the 51st minute but United goalkeeper Bill Hamid pushed it just above the crossbar.\n\nUnited coach Ben Olsen played Paul Arriola as an attacking midfielder for the third straight game. Arriola was not on the U.S. national team roster for recent friendlies against Mexico and Uruguay because of a family matter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An own goal put D.C.
