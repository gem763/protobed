However, the shackles of poor governance are preventing the country from attaining that potential. The word \u2018still\u2019 refers to the fact that even seventy years after it was born, the giant continues to be hobbled by shackles of its own making,\u201d Kar, who was earlier a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) told Indiatimes in an interview ahead of the release of his much anticipated book \u201cIndia: Still A Shackled Giant\u201d.\n\nRepresentational Image. BCCL\n\nPointing out that India is one of the largest economies in the world today and that India's finance minister has predicted it would be the third largest by 2030, Kar laments that yet an average Indian is worse off than his counterpart in other developing nations like Algeria, Indonesia, Mongolia and Morocco.\n\nDon't Miss 2.3 K SHARES 6 K SHARES 1.2 K SHARES\n\nThe difference in living standards, not just income, is very stark, he regrets.\n\nThe dismal state of affairs of the poor today, according to him, is not only due to rising income inequality but also due to poor investment choices made by the country's leaders since independence. Income inequality has increased rapidly since the 1980s and today, the top 10 percent of income earners account for a whopping 56 percent of total national income.\n\nBook Cover Courtesy: Penguin Random House India\n\n\u201cMy observation is that estimates of income inequality are largely based on official income surveys. However, with massive amounts of black money circulating and invested within India as well as flowing in and out, officially reported incomes of the top earners are typically underreported. In such cases, actual inequality is likely to be much worse than reported inequality based on official income data.\n\n\u201cThe problem of inequality may get worse before it gets better. The lack of investment in health, education, and vocational training for the poor since independence as well as the forces of globalization penalize the poor and benefit the rich and those connected to the global economy. Therefore, I expect inequality to decline at a glacial pace even if the government were to take concerted policy action,\u201d said Kar, who has focused on macroeconomic and statistical issues in a career spanning 32 years, and has visited several countries on IMF missions to study them.\n\nRepresentational Image. BCCL\n\nAs per the global hunger index released last week, less than 10% of infants in India are fed a \"minimum acceptable diet\". Kar said that feeding starving or malnourished babies is not going to get politicians many votes and lamented that such children are typically out of sight and out of mind.\n\n\u201cSure, the priorities are wrong but prestige projects in sync with election cycles are far more attractive for the politicians and their financiers,\u201d he observed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked of his prescription for overcoming hunger and malnourishment crisis in India, he said the country should implement a universal basic income in a targeted fashion and improve the delivery and stockpiling of food. He referred to the works of economists such as Amartya Sen and Abhijit Banerjee and said they have done seminal work in these areas.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE BCCL\n\n\u201cThe government should listen carefully to what they have to say and act according to its means. It is hard to see anything political about starving babies and malnourished children. But I agree that such schemes must be fiscally viable in the long run in the sense that the government needs to consolidate its various subsidies into one guaranteed basic income and also to find additional sources of tax revenue so as not to worsen the large fiscal deficits,\u201d he contended.\n\nHe also addresses the oft-unaddressed crisis in India's agriculture sector at length in two chapters to contend that the story has remained much the same for the vast majority of India\u2019s farmers since their woes were captured by landmark Bollywood movies such as \"Do Bigha Zamin\" (1953) and \"Mother India\" (1957).\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE. BCCL\n\nHe advised that the government should pay close attention to the well-being of the agriculture sector and that all parties have milked it well for vote-bank politics but farmers are otherwise a largely neglected lot.\n\n\u201cTheir woes are increasing. India's media should keep their eyes on that ball and further raise awareness regarding the plight of farmers. The majority of India's poor reside in the rural sector which is largely agrarian. Neglect of the agriculture sector is tantamount to a neglect of the poor. Left on its own and the terrible policies that spawn its troubles, the woes of the agriculture sector will multiply,\u201d he said before quipping that the government needs to expand water and electricity facilities at subsidized prices to poor farmers and implement policies that ensure that farmers earn a living wage.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE. BCCL\n\nHe further said that the government's well-intentioned loan waivers will not offer any lasting relief to farmers so long as farm incomes are not viable and lead to destitution and the need to borrow at usurious rates of interest just to survive.\n\nHe also said that the government should expand health and education facilities for farm families.\n\n\u201cFarmers must have access to basic education in order for them to appreciate improvements in farming techniques, communicate effectively with traders and government officials, take informed financial decisions, and effectively utilise irrigation, seeding, and other farming methods. Ignorance is a blight that needs to be eradicated from India's rural areas,\u201d said Kar, who has a PhD in economics from George Washington University.", "description": "The dismal state of affairs of the poor today, according to him, is not only due to rising income inequality but also due to poor investment choices made by the country's leaders since independence.
