Four workers died in falls from heights, and another four died in traffic accidents. Three died from the collapse or failure of structures and equipment.\n\nMORE WORKERS HURT\n\nWhile the number of workplace deaths declined, more workers were injured. There were 6,561 workplace injuries in the first half of this year, an increase from 6,073 in the same period last year.\n\nThe top cause of injuries, both major and minor, were from falling, slipping and tripping at work.\n\nThese resulted in 87 major injuries such as fractures in the first half of this year, down from 111 in the same period last year.\n\nThere were 1,757 minor injuries such as bruises and sprains, an increase from 1,630 between January and June last year.\n\n\"Although slips, trips and falls can happen anywhere, simple control measures such as proper housekeeping can help to prevent them,\" said MOM and the WSH Council.\n\nThe second most common cause of injuries involved machinery. There were 41 major and 1,066 minor machinery-related injuries between January and June this year, up from 35 and 956 in the same period last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the workplace became less hazardous in another area. The number of occupational diseases fell to 263 in the first half of this year, down from 295 between January and June last year.\n\nWork-related musculoskeletal disorders, noise-induced deafness and occupational skin diseases were the top three occupational diseases.\n\nThere were also fewer dangerous occurrences where no one was injured but which had the potential to cause serious injury and death. There were eight such near-misses in the first half of this year compared with 10 in the same period last year.\n\nDANGEROUS SECTORS\n\nThe sectors with the most number of fatal and major workplace injuries were construction, manufacturing, and transportation and storage.\n\nThe number of workplace injuries also increased in accommodation and food services; wholesale and retail trade; and professional services.\n\n\"It is encouraging that the first half of 2019 recorded the lowest half-yearly number of fatalities. However, we cannot be complacent as non-fatal injuries continue to rise, including in industries that were previously less accident-prone,\" said Mr Christopher Koh, MOM's director of policy for information and corporate services.\n\nMOM said that it conducted 2,500 spot checks in the first six months of this year. These checks found 4,300 workplace safety and health violations and 29 companies were ordered to stop work for an average of four weeks each to correct their lapses.\n\nIt also fined 300 companies a total of S$680,000 on the spot.\n\nThe ministry said it plans to conduct 2,500 inspections in the second half of this year as it continues to target the top injury-prone industries, as well as those that have seen a rise in major injuries.\n\nIt also warned that it will start releasing the workplace safety records of companies next year.\n\n\"(MOM) will publish injury statistics of companies, starting with the construction industry in 2020, so that safer companies will stand a better chance at securing business,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - WORKPLACE deaths have taken a dip in the first half of this year to reach a seven-year low. .
