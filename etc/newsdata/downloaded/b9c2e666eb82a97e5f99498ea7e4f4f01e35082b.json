One of the simplest is often overlooked: the health savings account, known as an HSA.These accounts, around since 2003, offer three tax breaks wrapped up into one, but their value is widely underestimated by wealthy families.\n\n\u201cOnly half of my clients are aware if they have an HSA when they come to me for the first time,\u201d says Jill Garvey, a senior wealth strategist at Huntington National Bank. \u201cIf they know they have the option, they think it\u2019s not worth it because there\u2019s a cap on their contributions.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the HSA isn\u2019t just a powerful tool to save for health-care needs; with careful accounting, wealthy folks can leave HSA assets untouched for years, growing tax-deferred. Later, they can be used either for health care or other costs in retirement. Taxpayers are eligible to open an HSA if their health insurance policy has a high deductible; a deductible must be at least $1,350 for a single policy and $2,700 for a family policy.\n\nThese accounts work much like 401(k)s or IRAs to accumulate assets. Employees can make contributions to an HSA with pretax dollars. For those who invest in an HSA independently of an employer, the contributions are tax-deductible\u2014even for those who claim the standard deduction and don\u2019t itemize deductions. Assets grow tax-\u200bdeferred in underlying investments.\n\nKnow Your HSA $7,000 Maximum contribution for couples this year in a health savings account. 55 Age at which individuals can contribute an extra $1,000. 20% Penalty incurred if HSA funds are used for anything but health-care costs prior to 65.\n\nContribution limits usually rise each year to adjust for inflation. This year, maximum investments are $3,500 for singles and $7,000 for couples. Those over age 55 can contribute an extra annual $1,000. Contributions for the calendar year can be made until the tax-filing deadline of the following year\u2014so a 2019 contribution can be made anytime until April 15, 2020.\n\nAssets can be taken out tax-free as long as they\u2019re used to cover health-care expenses. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful tool for paying medical expenses during your lifetime,\u201d Garvey says.\n\nAssuming the $7,000 maximum contribution rises $100 annually and is invested for a 5% average annual return, a 40-year-old couple getting started with an HSA now would have $428,000 by age 65, Garvey says. That\u2019s about $100,000 more than if they had put the money into a taxable account, assuming the couple is in the 35% tax bracket.\n\nJust about all states mimic the federal tax code when it comes to HSAs, with some exceptions such as California and New Jersey. When the account holder dies, the HSA can pass to the surviving spouse and retain its tax-free status for withdrawals. If inherited by a nonspouse beneficiary, assets in the account are subject to income taxes.\n\nMoney taken out prior to age 65 and used for anything but health-care expenses are subject not only to income taxes, but a 20% penalty, too. But after 65, these accounts can be used more broadly. At this stage, there\u2019s no penalty for using assets for expenses besides health care, but they will be counted as income and subject to income taxes, just as with a 401(k) or IRA.\n\nTo maximize these accounts, it\u2019s best to let them grow untouched and pay for health-care expenses with out-of-pocket funds. Years later, the tax-deferred account can be used to reimburse these expenses, tax-free.\n\n\u201cYou can open an account today, fund it for many years, but not touch it and instead allow it to grow tax-deferred. You can then use it to pay for any qualified expenses during retirement and the withdrawals will be tax-free,\u201d says Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird Private Wealth Management. Or, he adds, \u201cyou can also use it to reimburse yourself for expenses incurred in prior years. The expenses don\u2019t have to be incurred in the same year as the withdrawal, just sometime after the account was opened.\u201d\n\nThe caveat: It\u2019s important to keep excellent records over the years. Compile receipts for expenses, and bank or credit-card statements showing how non-HSA funds were used to cover expenses. Cumbersome as that may seem, those records will come in handy in the future for drawing on a potentially six-figure account, tax-free.", "description": "The value of a vehicle that allows assets to grow tax-deferred shouldn\u2019t be ignored, even by the wealthy", "authors": ["Karen Hube"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-99967/social", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
