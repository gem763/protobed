But Republicans argued the bill would stifle economic opportunities for the rural areas of the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and author of the legislation, said plans to jumpstart mining in the area are \"not theoretical and not trivial.\"\n\n\"These critical protections are under threat from the Trump administration under the guise of energy dominance and fabricated arguments of national security they've continued to push for these lands to be opened to exploitation on behalf of a few wealthy mining interests,\" he said Tuesday during House floor debate.\n\nWhat's next? Grijalva's bill does not have companion legislation in the Senate, and the White House issued a veto threat, saying the administration opposes \"such a large, permanent withdrawal, which would prohibit environmentally responsible development.\"\n\nThe vote on the bill, the Grand Canyon Centennial Act, comes as a White House working group organized to examine uranium supplies is considering recommending invoking a Cold War-era law that mandates the federal government buy uranium for enrichment for national security purposes.\n\nTheir recommendations, expected next month, could prompt the White House to lift a 20-year mining moratorium from 2012 that protected nearly 1,562 square miles outside the boundaries of the Grand Canyon.\n\nDemocrats have argued the U.S. does not need to tap into U.S. uranium reserves since many imports of the mineral come from allies like Canada and Australia.\n\n\"National security experts said this fear mongering about supplies is based on fantasy,\" Grijalva said Tuesday. \"We shouldn't be mining for uranium around the Grand Canyon. Period.\"\n\nRepublicans argued that Democrats have been exaggerating the risks to the Grand Canyon.\n\nRep.
