We get that computationally, not physically.\"\n\nTransporting the \"entirely burnt and extremely fragile\" scrolls from Paris to southern England presented \"some risks\", according to Francoise Berard, director of the Institut de France's library.\n\n\"The ideal would be not to handle them at all but obviously we want to help in the discovery of the contents,\" she said.\n\n\"Therefore we accepted certain risks of deterioration during transport but we take maximum precautions because they are fragile like butterfly wings.\"\n\nOther scientists have also tried non-invasive techniques to decode the documents to varying degrees of success.\n\nIn 2014 Daniel Delattre, a researcher at France's National Centre for Scientific Research, used a type of intensive X-ray to glimpse some of the scrolls' contents.\n\nThe method revealed Greek letters thought to be from the pen of Philodemus of Gadara, an Epicurean philosopher.\n\nMichel Zink, of France's Academy of Inscriptions and Letters, said such texts \"have rarely been preserved\" in any form.\n\n\"This is why these rolls are so important,\" the historian added.\n\n\"We can hope to succeed in reading entire sentences and perhaps one day, an entire text.\"", "description": "A leading science facility in the English countryside is helping in a bid to decipher Roman-era scrolls carbonised in the deadly eruption of Mount Vesuvius nearly 2,000 years ago.
