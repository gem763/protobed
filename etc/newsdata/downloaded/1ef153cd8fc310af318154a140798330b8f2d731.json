Unfortunately, not every washback survives. 100% of our washbacks that didn\u2019t make it had plastic in their intestinal tracts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This turtle, which would fit in the palm of your hand, had eaten 104 pieces of plastic. This is a sad reminder that we all need to do our part to keep our oceans plastic free.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe turtle had been eating various different kinds of plastic, staff revealed.\n\n\u2018We found a piece of a balloon.

These include the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), green turtle (Chelonia mydas), leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), Kemp\u2019s ridley turtle (Lepidochelys kempii) and hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata).\n\nA turtle\u2019s early years will be spent drifting around seaweed to find small shrimp and crustaceans to eat. Unfortunately, in 2019, they will also find heaps of manufactured non-biodegradable plastic in there as well.", "description": "The heartbreaking picture was shared on Facebook", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88954616_1570530718.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
