The tweet asked to raise awareness about the world\u2019s most well-known cryptocurrency:\n\n\u201cThis Friday the 18 millionth Bitcoin will be mined. There are only #3MillionLeft. Let\u2019s make this hashtag trend so the world can learn about Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThis initiative is not surprising from Pompliano, given that he said on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box that over half of his net worth is in Bitcoin in August. What he hints at is that so far 17,997,150 BTC have been mined \u2014 according to Bitcoin data website BitcoinBlockHalf \u2014 and the upper limit for how many BTCs there will ever be hardcoded in the system is 21 million.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s block rewards will decrease\n\nAs the number of coins left to be earned by securing Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain continues to decrease, BTC\u2019s halving also approaches. The event will see the amount of Bitcoin created with each new block cut in half.\n\nBitcoinBlockHalf estimates that on 14 May 2020 \u2014 the date is tentative, given the irregularity of Bitcoin\u2019s block time \u2014 the block reward will be cut from 12.5 to 6.25 coins. The website also points out that 85.7% of all coins have already been mined.\n\nAs the number of coins that still have to be mined decreases, the competition to get hold of them seemingly increases. As Cointelegraph reported in late September, Bitcoin\u2019s network hash rate has passed a record 102 quintillion hashes for the first time in the coin\u2019s history.", "description": "American investor and co-founder of investment firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets Anthony Pompliano pointed out that only about three million BTC more will ever b...", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNzgxNTEzMDJkZWY0M2JhMDc5NTNjYTUyYjIzNmViNjcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
