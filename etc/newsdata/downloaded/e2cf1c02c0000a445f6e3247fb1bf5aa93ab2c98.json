They'll say it's a Class One activation, which means everybody presents to the trauma bay.\u201d\n\nHe soon found out the patient was Roy Horn, one of the legendary entertainers behind the famous \u201cSiegfried and Roy\u201d shows, who had been bitten by his white tiger, Mantecore, during a performance.\n\nWatch the full story on the season premiere of \"20/20\" FRIDAY, Sept. 27 at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nSiegfried & Roy/The Mirage via Getty Images\n\nWhen Horn arrived at the hospital\u2019s level I trauma center, doctors quickly determined he had suffered major puncture wounds to his neck.\n\n\u201cA tiger bite to the neck\u2026 We don\u2019t see that on a daily basis like a gunshot wound, so you have no idea what to expect,\u201d MacIntyre said.\n\nThe tiger\u2019s teeth had gone in deep enough to damage enough blood vessels, causing serious internal bleeding, MacIntyre said, and the injuries \u201ccompromised Horn\u2019s airway.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to deal with that first,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not breathing for over, like, three minutes, you will have irreversible brain death.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nHorn was rushed into emergency surgery.\n\nDr. Jay Coates, a trauma surgeon at UMC who operated on Horn, said, \u201cWe had to operate on his neck where the wounds were at and control the bleeding.\u201d\n\nThe two doctors said Horn even died -- at least once -- before they revived him.\n\n\u201cRoy was in such distress from his airway -- loss of airway -- that his heart stopped multiple times,\u201d MacIntyre said.\n\n\u201cHe actually flatlined...or died,\u201d Coates added. \u201cWe lost vital signs on him.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nCoates said that Horn left the hospital about a month after he was admitted. He said Horn \u201cwas with it enough to communicate with us, [but] he was still on a respirator intermittently.\u201d\n\nMacIntyre added that this was where the \u201creal journey\u201d began for the entertainer.\n\n\u201cYou have to literally go back to, like, when you were an infant, and learn how to walk again, and how to talk again and how to swallow, and [Horn\u2019s] drive, I believe, is what got him through this,\u201d MacIntyre said.\n\nDoctors were able to save Horn\u2019s life, and he eventually made a remarkable recovery, but he had suffered a stroke, though when the stroke happened, and what caused the tiger to bite Horn, has been questioned.\n\nA relationship built on trust\n\nBy all accounts, the Vegas entertainers should have had their last performance on Oct. 3, 2003.\n\nThe German duo Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn were a smashing success on the Las Vegas Strip at The Mirage hotel and had become one of the top-grossing acts on the Strip. They were masters of magic who shared a stage with some of the rarest and most beautiful animals, including white lions and tigers.\n\nSiegfried & Roy/The Mirage via Getty Images\n\nMantecore had long been a fixture in \u201cSiegfried and Roy\u201d shows. Appearing in the last half-hour, Mantecore would be led out by Horn on a leash to walk onstage.\n\nLynette Chappell, one of the duo\u2019s closest collaborators who had worked with the pair since the 1970s, was part of the 2003 show when the incident happened.\n\n\u201cHe would turn [Mantecore] around. [Mantecore] would be seated, and then...Roy would give the command and Mantecore would react to the command and rise up,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cThen, Roy would exit and go upstage with Mantecore.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nHorn had performed the same act with Mantecore thousands of times, Fischbacher said. In their 30-plus years of performing with animals, Fischbacher told \u201c20/20\u201d in the pair\u2019s exclusive interview that there had been no major incidents -- only some \u201cminor mishaps\u201d with their animals -- until that day in 2003.\n\n\"[There was] only that one [major incident]. And that was an accident,\" Fischbacher said.\n\nFor example, a black jaguar once popped out of a trunk onstage and its chain had broken. Another time, a tiger named Sarah jumped out from a bush in the garden of their jungle-like Las Vegas compound and pinned Horn to the floor. Horn bit her on the nose to make her release him. \u201cShe is going by pure of her instinct [sic],\u201d Horn said in a 1996 ABC News interview. \u201cWell, I went by pure of my instinct, what another cat will do in the wild. \u2026 So I pull her [in] and then I bit her on the nose. She was startled.\u201d\n\nHorn said that Sarah got up, walked away and looked at him, after which he signaled to her that everything was OK.\n\n\u201cThey are simple-minded,\u201d he said, comparing them to 6- or 7-year-old children with hundreds of pounds of power. \u201cSo you can\u2019t argue. You cannot, with force, get them to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. You analyze what they\u2019re doing the best, what is their personality, so you never put them in a situation they wouldn\u2019t like to do.\u201d\n\nTo build trust with his cats, Horn would train them essentially from birth, he said.\n\n\u201cThe first voice they hear, it\u2019s mine,\u201d Horn said in a previous interview. \u201cThe first face they see is mine. So most probably they think I am a tiger. I\u2019m sort of their father figure. I guide them through their childhood. I let them know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, [and learn] the way they\u2019re comfortable. They\u2019re looking for me as sort of a security blanket.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhat caused the tiger to grab Horn?\n\nHorn said during that October 2003 show, he felt dizzy on stage, then tripped and fell. Then, Horn said, he saw his 400-pound, 7-foot-long white Bengal tiger named Mantecore standing over him.\n\n\"Mantecore went on top of him, and he looked around,\" Fischbacher recalled of the tiger, who he said appeared to not understand what was happening.\n\nThe tiger grabbed Horn by the neck and dragged him toward his cage offstage because, according to Horn and Fischbacher, the tiger was trying to protect Horn, not attack him, after he fell, which they said was the result of a stroke.\n\nStagehands were stunned by what was happening and rushed to try to help.\n\n\u201cMantecore was carrying Roy, heading toward his cage,\u201d said Curtis Rowe, an electrician and stagehand who worked on the show. \u201cI grabbed him by the tail, which caused Mantecore to stop\u2026 He\u2019s like halfway in his cage now and he still had a hold of Roy by the neck.\u201d\n\nPlay\n\nThey grabbed a fire extinguisher and fired it at the tiger, which they said caused Mantecore to drop Horn. They then rushed to Horn\u2019s aid as he lay bleeding profusely on the floor.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really know what to do other than just put pressure on those wounds, you know?\u201d Rowe said. \u201cHe had seconds to live. \u2026 All we can do is wait for paramedics.\u201d\n\nHowever, Chris Lawrence, one of the trainers who was working the show that night, disputes Horn\u2019s account of why he fell. He gave his version to The Hollywood Reporter in March saying that the tiger had missed his mark on stage during the performance and then Horn\u2019s actions right after that caused the act to go awry.\n\nLawrence, who said he was in the wings when the incident happened, said in a statement that, \"instead of [Horn\u2019s] walking Mantecore in a circle, as is usually done, he just used his arm to steer him right back into his body\u2026 By Roy not following the correct procedure, it fed into confusion and rebellion.\"\n\nFischbacher maintained that Horn had fallen as the result of the stroke, then Mantecore came over and was \"of course\" just trying to help him offstage. Fischbacher said he had \"no idea\" why Lawrence came forward in March with a different version of the incident, adding, \"He had problems with his life anyway.\"\n\nThe only video of the incident was taken by cameras in The Mirage, and it has never been publicly released.\n\nCashman Photo of Nevada\n\n\u2018Siegfried and Roy\u2019 returns to the stage\n\nAfter the incident, the \u2018Siegfried and Roy\u2019 show was shut down.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees animal welfare, investigated the incident, but in the end, it was unable to officially determine a cause for it. The USDA also did not determine whether Horn had suffered a stroke before or after the tiger grabbed him, according to David Neal, a senior investigator on the case.\n\nAs Horn recovered, Fischbacher was dealing with his own emotional struggles.\n\n\u201cBoth Siegfried and Roy were wounded in this accident. It was very, very difficult for Siegfried. He lost part of his soul then too,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cWithout Roy\u2019s influence, Siegfried didn\u2019t know what path he was on.\u201d\n\nHorn still loved his animals and eventually returned to the Las Vegas compound to be with them, saying that his time with them was rehabilitation for both his emotional and physical being.\n\n\u201cWhen Roy started to recover, he took Siegfried along with him, and in doing so, Siegfried started to give Roy the support, and as you see them now, they walk next to each other,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cSiegfried supports Roy. Roy supports Siegfried.\u201d\n\nFor a while, the pair focused on regaining their health. They participated in a project with DreamWorks called \u201cFather of the Pride,\u201d a racy comedy show that premiered in 2004 on NBC in which John Goodman and Cheryl Hines voiced computer-animated versions of the \u201cSiegfried and Roy\u201d animals. But the TV show failed after one season.\n\nPlay\n\nDeciding to return to the stage one final time, Fischbacher and Horn said they didn\u2019t just want to perform, but also give back.\n\nOn March 1, 2009, Fischbacher and Horn held a benefit show for the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. They raised $14 million, Fischbacher said. He added that the choice to work with the Lou Ruvo Center was deliberate because the center is devoted to brain injury research and focuses on supporting caregivers.\n\nOn the night of the show, Fischbacher and Horn said they once again brought out Mantecore and performed a short series of magic tricks. On the feeling of getting back on stage again, Horn said he was \u201cspeechless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d Fischbacher added. \u201cI can\u2019t say...how I felt. I just thought, \u2018This is for the audience.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey also are now working on a biopic with German filmmakers Nico Hofmann and Bully Herbig that they will expand into a multi-part docuseries for television.\n\nABC News' Tom Berman, Jen Joseph and Rachel Wenzlaff contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/siegfried-02-as-gty-190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
