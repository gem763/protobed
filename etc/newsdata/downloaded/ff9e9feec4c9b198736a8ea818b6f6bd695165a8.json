With an initiation fee of $7,500 and an annual fee of $2,500, it's for big spenders.\n\nIt's also invite-only; you can't apply without permission from Amex.\n\nThe card offers some incredible benefits, like complimentary elite status across four hotel chains and with Delta, airport arrival services, and access to a concierge.\n\nWhile some of these perks are exclusive to the Amex black card, you can enjoy many of them with the Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express and the Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express.\n\nAlso known as the Centurion card, the American Express \"black\" card is so prestigious that you have to be invited to use it. Yes, you read that right \u2014 you can't just apply for it and expect to get approved. You have to receive a private invitation from American Express.\n\nSo, how do you get an invite for a black card? While the requirements aren't officially published, rumor has it that you have to be a high earner who has spent and paid off between $350,000 and $500,000 across all of your American Express accounts in a calendar year. And once you're approved for the card, there's a $7,500 initiation fee, and a $2,500 annual fee. It makes premium credit cards like the Amex Platinum ($550 annual fee) and the Amex Business Platinum ($595) look downright affordable.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nRead more: If you only want to pay $450+ for one premium credit card, which should you choose?\n\nBenefits of the Amex black card\n\nAside from the status symbol that comes with simply carrying an Amex black card in your wallet, you can enjoy these perks by having one.\n\nHotel elite status\n\nWith a black card, you can lock in hotel elite status at four major hotel chains: Marriott, Hilton, Intercontinental Hotels Group, and Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux. Hotel elite status gets you sweet benefits like room upgrades, late checkouts, resort and spa credits, and free breakfast.\n\nThe Amex Platinum and Amex Business Platinum offer status with Hilton and Marriott, but not with IHG and Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux.\n\nRead more: Credit cards that get you hotel elite status just by having them in your wallet\n\nDelta elite status\n\nAccording to The Points Guy, the black card also offers cardholders Platinum Medallion elite status with Delta. You can't get this benefit with any other credit card, and it offers you perks like complimentary upgrades and bonus miles.\n\nAirport lounge access\n\nThere's nothing better than knowing you have access to a comfortable airport lounge while you're traveling, especially if you have a long layover. The Amex black card gets you free access to more than 1,200 airport lounges around the world, including Amex Centurion Lounges, Delta Sky Clubs when you're flying Delta, and Priority Pass airport lounges. You can sit back and relax on the comfortable chairs while indulging in some good food and drinks.\n\nThe airport lounge access you get as a Centurion cardholder is virtually identical to the lounge access you get with the Amex Platinum and Amex Business Platinum.\n\nRead more: I held off on opening the Business Platinum card until I discovered Amex Centurion Lounges. This benefit alone is worth the $595 annual fee for me.\n\n24/7 concierge service\n\nAn Amex black card gets you your own personal concierge whenever you'd like one. You can count on the round-the-clock concierge service to help you make travel plans or reservations at exclusive restaurants. This service can also get you tickets to just about any event and/or purchase gifts on your behalf.\n\nOnce again, the Amex Platinum and Business Platinum also offer concierge services. However, Centurion cardmembers are definitely the top priority for Amex concierge, and they get the best access to restaurant reservations and more.\n\nInternational arrival service\n\nIf you travel abroad often, you'll love the black card's international arrival service. As long as you fly business or first class via American Express Travel, you'll be assigned to your own personal guide who will make the immigration and customs process a breeze. This isn't a benefit you can replicate with any other Amex card.\n\nNo spending limit\n\nThere are no preset spending limits with the black card, so you can easily buy big-ticket items that you may not necessarily be able to pay for with other credit cards. Keep in mind, however, that since the black card is technically a\"charge card,\" you must pay off your balances in full every month. (The Amex Platinum and Business Platinum are also charge cards.)\n\nOther lifestyle perks\n\nBeyond offering elite status with more travel partners, international arrival service, and the top tier of Amex concierge service, the black card stands out from the Amex Platinum and Business Platinum with its selection of wine-related benefits, such as consultations with a wine specialist and wine-buying offers.\n\nBlack cardholders also get several shopping perks, including special offers and VIP benefits with Net-a-Porter.\n\nThe Amex Platinum is more attainable, and offers many of the same perks\n\nIf you don't get an invite for the American Express black card, don't fret. As you can see, many of the benefits it offers are available on the Amex Platinum, which has a $550 fee. You'll get no preset spending limits, hotel elite status, complimentary access to airport lounges, and concierge services.\n\nRead more: Amex Platinum card review\n\nIf you're a business user, the Amex Business Platinum is worth a look.
