The the long-awaited, 100-page plan is the state's official blueprint for future energy generation, including things like projected electricity demand, cost estimates, and from what sources power will be generated.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, Cabinet indicated that the IRP would include nine interventions for the country to respond to energy needs in the next decade.\n\nMinister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe told a media briefing on Friday morning that South Africa is not planning large nuclear units, but smaller, modular nuclear plants.\n\nThese interventions included:\n\nGovernment will immediately start a nuclear build programme to add 2 500MW of power \u201cbecause it is a no-regret option in the long term\u201d.\n\nThe Koeberg nuclear power plant will be extended by another 20 years. The Koeberg plant was supposed to reach its end of life by 2024.\n\nGovernment will immediately start to buy power from private suppliers.\n\nThe plan also refers to the changing role of Eskom, as its generation, transmission and distribution functions will be separated.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Government has gazetted the intergrated resources plan for 2019.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9445/9682194bc5f940159a3300da5c53cf22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
