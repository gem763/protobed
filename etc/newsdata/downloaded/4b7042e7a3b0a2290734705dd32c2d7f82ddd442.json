Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) did not elaborate on the reason for the delay, but senators suggested it may be because Ozerden was still short of the votes needed to move forward.\n\nOzerden already faces opposition from Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, and will need some Democratic support to advance. But that Democratic backing is in question after civil rights groups like the NAACP and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights sent letters to senators asking them to oppose Ozerden.\n\n\u201cThere is Republican opposition and a number of groups whose input I value have raised some significant concerns,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who is likely to vote against Ozerden. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be some efforts over the next week by the judge\u2019s advocates to try and address those concerns but if unsuccessful I suspect the nomination will end up being withdrawn.\u201d\n\nThe NAACP, in its letter, described the Mississippi judge\u2019s nomination as a \u201cbrazen insult\u201d to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 civil rights legacy \u2014 and raised concerns about a slew of decisions he made on race- and gender-based discrimination cases.\n\n\u201cJudge Ozerden\u2019s record of hostility to civil rights protections demonstrates that he lacks the fundamental qualities necessary for dispensing justice in a fair and impartial manner,\u201d wrote Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington bureau.\n\nDianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary committee, plans to vote against Ozerden and said Thursday she doubted he would receive any support from Democrats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the Republicans are going to do but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have many \u2014 if any \u2014 Democratic votes,\u201d she said.\n\nOzerden\u2019s allies are hoping they can rally more support between now and next week. He has strong backing from Mulvaney, who was a groomsman at his wedding and pushed for Ozerden\u2019s nomination last year despite objections from the White House counsel\u2019s office, as well as Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear what will be different next week that would benefit Ozerden. Thursday marked the second time his committee vote was delayed. The committee shelved his vote in September, right before a two-week recess, shortly after Hawley announced his opposition.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who plans to support Ozerden\u2019s nomination, said that with the delay, the administration \u201cis trying to work out some of the concerns that have been addressed.\u201d\n\nSince his nomination, Republicans have criticized a decision Ozerden made as a federal judge that deemed a challenge to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate premature. Ozerden also lacks backing from the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, whose chief counsel Carrie Severino wrote last year that the administration could \u201cdo better\" than him.\n\nEven prior to his confirmation hearing, Senate Republicans were briefed on his FBI background check prior \u2014 which typically occurs when there is a potential issue with a nominee.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s still some folks that have questions, kind of struggling and going through the vetting like I am too,\u201d said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who is undecided.\n\n\u201cI think the votes are still kind of mushy,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding Republican support, GOP senators have yet to ask the White House to withdraw the nomination. In a brief interview, Hawley said: \u201cThat\u2019s up to them.\u201d\n\n", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s embattled judicial pick to the powerful Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals faced another setback Thursday, after the Judiciary Committee once again delayed a vote on his nomination.
