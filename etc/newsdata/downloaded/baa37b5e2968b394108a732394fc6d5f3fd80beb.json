And another growing storm threatened tourist resorts along Mexico\u2019s Pacific.\n\nBermuda Gov. John Rankin called up 120 members of the Royal Bermuda Regiment to prepare for possible storm recovery efforts and National Security Minister Wayne Caines said urged everyone to be off the streets by 5 p.m.\n\nAuthorities ordered early closings of schools, clinics and government offices.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said tropical storm-force winds began to hit the islands of some 70,000 people in the early afternoon and warned that hurricane-force gusts would probably last until early Thursday.\n\nJames Dodgson, director of the Bermuda Weather Service, said the storm was projected to pass about 80 miles to the north of Bermuda around 8 p.m. Wednesday and could produce tornadoes and dangerous storm surge.\n\n\u201cHumberto\u2019s a big hurricane and we\u2019re looking at the conditions already deteriorating. There\u2019s some very strong winds kicking in, particularly this evening,\u201d he said.\n\nCaines said non-emergency medical services would be closed until Thursday. Evening flights from the U.S. and Great Britain were canceled.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to ask all of Bermuda to prepare for the storm, to know that the government and everyone is rooting for us, and we can get through this,\u201d Caines said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before.\u201d\n\nHumberto\u2019s maximum sustained winds strengthened to 120 mph and the storm was centered about 140 miles west of Bermuda early Wednesday afternoon. It was moving east-northeast at 16 mph.\n\nHurricane-force winds extended outward up to 105 miles from the center, with tropical-storm-force winds reaching as far as 195 miles\n\nMeanwhile, Tropical Storm Lorena posed an increasing threat to tourist resorts on Mexico\u2019s Pacific Coast and the Baja California Peninsula.\n\nSix simultaneous named storms combined in the Atlantic & Eastern Pacific Basins is thought to have tied a modern record, and is keeping forecasters very busy. https://t.co/qQzUMr8G5D pic.twitter.com/g5BbF7ZGuP \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) September 18, 2019\n\nForecasters said Lorena was expected to brush or hit land by early Thursday somewhere between the port of Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta while growing toward hurricane force. The still-uncertain long-term forecast track showed it moving on toward the Los Cabos resorts by Saturday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds had increased to near 70 mph by the early afternoon, with higher gusts.\n\nIt was located about 100 miles south-southeast of Manzanillo and was moving northwest at 13 mph early Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMexican officials also said they were concerned that some parts of southern Mexico, which have seen a lack of rainfall, could now get torrential rains and floods from a combination of Lorena and two other weather systems in the area.\n\nIn Texas, the remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda threatened to drench parts of Southwest Texas and southwestern Louisiana with up to 18 inches of rain over the next few days. It was the first named storm to hit the Houston area since Hurricane Harvey\u2019s much heavier rains flooded more than 150,000 homes around the city and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage in Texas.\n\nTropical Storm Jerry also formed Wednesday morning and was forecast to become a hurricane as it nears the outermost Caribbean islands Thursday night or Friday.\n\nFurther off Mexico\u2019s Pacific Coast, Tropical Storm Mario also was expected to be a hurricane by Thursday, while staying out to sea.", "description": "Powerful winds from Hurricane Humberto began hitting Bermuda on Wednesday as the government urged people to stay off the streets during the British...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR589_humber_ZG_20190918170434.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
