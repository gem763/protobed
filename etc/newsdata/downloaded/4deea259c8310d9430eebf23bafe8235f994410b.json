REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain\n\nThe move came following a spike in violent crime in the southern district of Cox\u2019s Bazar, where more than one million Rohingya are sheltered.\n\n\u201cWe have asked the operators to stop 3G and 4G services from 5pm to 6am in the camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar,\u201d said Zakir Hossain Khan, spokesman for the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), adding the decision had been made for security reasons.\n\n\u201cThey have also been asked to inform us by Sept. 9 what measures they are taking to withdraw the SIMs that are being used by the Rohingya community and what they will do to stop selling SIMs to them,\u201d he added.\n\nThe operators were asked on Sunday to block mobile services and stop selling mobile SIMs to the Rohingya.\n\nThe order to stop mobile services had been reissued following reports of providing mobile phone services to Rohingya through selling of SIM cards by carriers defying a government ban, Khan said.\n\nMore than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state for Bangladesh after a military-led crackdown in August 2017 that the United Nations has said was perpetrated with \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d. Myanmar has denied almost all the allegations.\n\nEfforts to begin repatriating 3,450 Rohingya cleared by Myanmar failed on Aug. 22 after none agreed to go, almost a year after a similar effort failed amid protests.\n\nBut with continuing uncertainty over their return to Myanmar, refugees in Bangladesh are being drawn towards drugs and violent crime, according to officials.\n\nTensions are running high in the camps after a youth wing leader from Bangladesh\u2019s ruling Awami League party was killed last week, allegedly by Rohingya refugees, and at least four Rohingya were shot dead by police.\n\n\u201cWe are working round-the-clock to maintain safety and security in the camps. But the situation is getting worse day by day,\u201d said Iqbal Hossain, additional superintendent of police in Cox\u2019s Bazar.\n\nRohingya refugees said the communication blackout will isolate Rohingya from family in Myanmar.\n\n\u201cWhy Bangladesh is being too harsh towards us? How we will communicate with our relatives in Myanmar?,\u201d Abdur Rahim, a Rohingya leader in Cox\u2019s Bazar, told Reuters by phone.\n\n\u201cThis will have a bad impact on crimes also. How will we inform the police immediately if any crimes are happening in the camps?\u201d\n\nBangladesh has four mobile companies that include Grameenphone, majority owned by Norwegian telecoms group Telenor; Robi Axiata; Telecom Ventures\u2019s Banglalink; and state-owned Teletalk.\n\nThe operators did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Bangladesh's telecom regulatory authority on Tuesday ordered mobile phone operators to partially block high-speed data services to areas where Rohingya refugees are living in sprawling camps, citing security concerns following recent violence in the area.", "authors": ["Ruma Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425825599&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821FB"}
