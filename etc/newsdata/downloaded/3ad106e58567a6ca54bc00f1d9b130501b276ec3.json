We intend to comply with it.\n\nPeter is one of over 200 people who have kindly responded to NR\u2019s request for camaraderie and support, in which we encourage our readers to offer a contribution. It\u2019s purposes: A contribution \u2013 let\u2019s make that your contribution \u2013 will in part help defray the legal costs born by NR in its ongoing defense of free speech in Mann v. National Review. As we argued in in a recent editorial concerning our appeal to the United States Supreme Court \u2013 that it take up this case, the nation\u2019s most important battle over the First Amendment \u2013 free speech needs vindicating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to Peter: Fighting for the Constitution is more than an NR intention \u2013 it\u2019s a very real activity. We appreciate his kindness and encouragement, which is not solitary. Many have done as Peter has, giving from $5 to $2,500, and of those, many have attached to their generosity explanations, exhortations, attaboys, and go-get-\u2018ems. As is our custom, we share some here:\n\nStephen from Minneapolis sends NR $100 and offers these thoughts: \u201cThank you for your work and good luck with your mission as we head into 2020. I\u2019ve enjoyed reading many articles on your pages. Andrew McCarthy\u2019s work over the last few years is what has brought me to your site, several others have kept me reading. To free speech, free markets, powder days and deplorables!\u201d Thanks and have to admit \u2013 not sure what Powder Days are all about, but sounds fun.\n\nFrom Nebraska, George tenders a kind $50 along with a quote and an expectation: \u201c\u2018We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men\u2019 \u2013 George Orwell. Sending the money in his honor. Hope and expect he would do the same in my shoes.\u201d G.O. was a big fan of long-time NR editor James Burnham, just saying. Also just saying: Thanks very much.\n\nFrom Stamford, CT, where our founder lived, James sports us $100 and some encouragement: \u201cNR remains a strong bulwark against socialist authoritarianism. Happy to help. Keep fighting the good fight!\u201d Keeping!\n\nOut Missouri way, Aaron matches that C note and offers some analysis: \u201cFree, unrestricted debate is fundamental to our republic. Of all the cases SCOTUS should hear and rule on, this is one of the most meaningful.\u201d Damn straight. Also, darn tootin\u2019. We hope to hear from SCOUTS sometime before the feast day of Pino Puglisi, one tough hombre. Thanks Aaron.\n\nIn Granbury, TX, Michael is tossing $25 into the collection basket, hitting nothing but net, along with some pointed thoughts: \u201cLittle is more precious than free speech. As the NBA has proven in the last couple of days, the chilling of free speech has profound risks for our democracy. In that spirit I am pleased to contribute to your legal defense in the Mann case.\u201d Your kindness means a lot to us. Thank you.\n\nAnother $25 comes from Michigan, where John is being generous and back-slapping: \u201cThank you NRO for your daily dose of perspective, clarity and humility. I can\u2019t think of another publication that not only gives thoughtful analysis to the \u2018other side\u2019s\u2019 point of view, but also asks hard questions of \u2018our side\u2019s\u2019 direction. I\u2019m a daily reader looking forward to years of continued education and much needed laughter. Thanks again for all that you do. Keep up the good fight!\u201d More keeping!\n\nFrom Arlington, VA, Linda makes a $100 donation and applauds some of our recent efforts: \u201cNational Review has always been great, but the recent issues with themes to them (e.g., against socialism, pro capitalism) have been just sensational. I\u2019ve saved them to read again. Good luck with the Mann fight.\u201d If we prevail, it will be because good people like yourself had our back.\n\nUp in Syracuse, John sees fit to donate a sweet $100. And then he has this to say: \u201cJurisprudential positivism is here proven to be incompatible with free speech. If that approach passes for justice here, it will eventually, through consistent application, explain away all our founding principles and the documents that assert them. NR is taking a stand on the barricades of our civilization because of the extremity of the opposition.\u201d Indeed John, they dream dreams where the walls come tumbling down. We aim to be their nightmare \u2013 thanks in part to you.\n\nFolks, these forthcoming weeks of asking for your support, well, to quote Mr. Starr, It Don\u2019t Come Easy. After all, these pleas interrupt your reading of NR\u2019s wisdom. But then it dawns: Minus the persistent generosity of many readers, and the inclusion every few months of goodly souls who realize the reality that NR is a bigger thing, a cause, and one worthy of being sustained, there is no NR to read. And as for our legal fight, well, God help us all \u2013 and we do mean all \u2013 if how we write is colored by the likes of the antagonist behind Mann v. National Review. So we ask, especially to those who are NRO frequent flyers but who have yet to toss a buck in the tip jar: Please make a donation today, if only to help underwrite our mutual fight for free speech. Donate here. If you prefer to send a check, make one payable to \u201cNational Review\u201d and mail it to National Review, ATTN: 2019 Fall Webathon, 19 West 44th Street, Suite 1701, New York, NY 10036.
