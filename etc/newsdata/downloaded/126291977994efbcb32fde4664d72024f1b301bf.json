Our creative director pitched the idea that to be truly sustainable you would go nude, [so] we riffed on the idea of \u2018buck is best.\u2019\u201d\n\nMatt adds, \u201cThe idea may have started somewhat half-hearted, but quickly led to a campaign focused on educating consumers about apparel pollution and promoting the idea that to save the planet we all need to go nude or wear sustainable.\u201d\n\nThey looked to tried-and-true experiential marketing to make it happen. The company purchased an early edition Shasta trailer and transformed it into what Matt calls \u201cmore art installation than mobile showroom,\u201d essentially creating an educational campaign on wheels, entitled the \u201cSave the Planet\u201d Tour.\n\nThe trailer was outfitted in sustainable materials, including upcycled cork, recycled steel, reclaimed sawdust fiberboard, and salvaged beetle-kill pine and featured a number of vignettes mapping out the different steps of apparel production and how Toad&Co\u2019s standards were helping to improve the process. There are a few pieces of clothing blended into the setup, but the idea is education first and foremost.\n\nThe tour has stopped in almost 50 self-described \u201cnext generation\u201d cities (such as Portland, Ore.), and will wrap up in California before returning to the company\u2019s home base in Santa Barbara, Calif., in November.\n\n\u201cWe want people to feel empowered,\u201d Matt says.\n\nThis year the company created an educational campaign on wheels, entitled the \"Save the Planet\" Tour. Toad&Co\n\nTHE ITEMS\n\nThe company has a rather wide range of styles for both men and women\u2014think everything from sweaters to skirts. Matt says they\u2019re seeing some big traction with their hemp-based fabric and with their \u201cEarthworks\u201d lineup, made from primarily organic cotton. Their spring 2019 collection was the first that achieved 100% sustainability (defined as an entire line made from at least 80% sustainable materials).\n\nPRICE\n\nGarments start at US$40 for T-shirts and top out around US$200 for sweaters.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nOn the heels of their spring \u201919 collection sustainability mark (described as 80% of the garments\u2019 contents using sustainable fibers, fabrics, and/or certifications), the company felt ready to make a firm statement about their product and wanted to put themselves in high-traffic positions to do so.\n\n\u201cWe felt it was our duty to educate consumers on what makes the apparel industry dirty,\u201d Matt says, \u201cand show them what we\u2019re doing as a brand to make a difference.\u201d\n\nThe tour feels like an encapsulation of the company\u2019s multiple decades of environmental stewardship along with a sizable and transparent online presence about the materials they use and the processes to get there.\n\nIn 2018, Toad&Co was using 5% recycled materials across their clothing line. By the end of this year, they'll reach 8%, 12% in 2020, and forecast 20% by 2023. Toad&Co\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE GOOD\n\nThe bottom third of Toad&Co\u2019s Sustainability page lists their seven current environmental partners, many of which they\u2019ve had long relationships with. Among the longest is the Conservation Alliance, with whom they\u2019ve been working for more than 20 years. Four years ago, Toad&Co implemented a standard that any non-profit they work with must also qualify as a 1% for the Planet organization, which requires member companies and individuals to pledge 1% of their gross sales or annual salary to an environmental non-profit. The company also worked to offset as much of the carbon as possible created by this year\u2019s national tour.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nBeyond the spring \u201919 sustainability achievement, the company has larger, loftier textile goals set up incrementally over the next five years.\n\nIn 2018, Toad&Co was using 5% recycled materials across their clothing line. By the end of this year, they\u2019ll reach 8%, 12% in 2020, and forecast 20% by 2023.\n\nMatt also noted they\u2019re working hard to reduce synthetics\u2014one of the worst polluters within the apparel industry\u2014with a goal of using only recycled synthetics by 2025.\n\nBy 2023, Toad&Co plans to use exclusively fabrics that have had some sort of reputable, third-party verification such as Bluesign or Echotec.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with that,\u201d Matt says, \u201cis that in other industries, there are established standards but apparel is still working on it.\u201d", "description": "The California company embarked on a nationwide tour this summer to highlight key industry pollution issues", "authors": ["Geoff Nudelman"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-117978/social", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
