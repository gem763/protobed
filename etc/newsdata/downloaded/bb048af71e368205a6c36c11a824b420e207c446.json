From her \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 proposal to combat climate change to her clapbacks against Trump and her critics, here\u2019s how AOC danced her way into the spotlight. USA TODAY\n\nAfter freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez officially endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president at a Queens, N.Y. rally on Saturday, the Vermont progressive said he wants Ocasio-Cortez to work in his White House\n\nSanders was asked in a joint interview with CBS News if he would consider Ocasio-Cortez to be his running mate. The congresswoman answered for him as both laughed: \"I think I'm too young for that.\"\n\n\"There you go, she's answered,\" Sanders added.\n\nBut when Ocasio-Cortez was asked if she'd work in Sanders' administration should he be elected president, he interjected with a forceful \"Yes, you would.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, said at the rally that the pressure that has been on her since she was elected to office made her \"appreciate the enormous, consistent, and non-stop advocacy\" of Sanders.\n\nSen. @BernieSanders is getting a major boost to his presidential campaign after his heart attack nearly three weeks ago. Congresswoman @AOC endorsed him in front of more than 25,000 people at a weekend rally in New York City. @NikolenDC sat down with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. pic.twitter.com/Zh5JMdxTon \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) October 21, 2019\n\nSanders' recent health scare was a \"gut check,\" Ocasio-Cortez told CBS. She informed Sanders of her decision to back his campaign while he was still recovering from a heart attack earlier this month.\n\n\"Neither me nor the senator cannot do this by ourselves,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nOn health scare: Bernie Sanders reassured voters following heart attack\n\nLast week's Democratic primary debate was Sanders' return to the campaign trail following his hospitalization, and in response to a question about his heart attack and recovery at the debate, the 78-year-old said, \"I\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great.\"\n\nSanders canceled several campaign events after his surgery but said that he would continue with a \"vigorous\" campaign.\n\nSanders also has the backing of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and she and Ocasio-Cortez have faced some criticism from those who question their choice to support a white man's candidacy.\n\nWhen asked why, as a woman of color, Ocasio-Cortez made that decision, she said, \"I'm actually very excited about this partnership because it shows what we have to do in our country, is that we have to come together across race, across gender, across generation.\"\n\n'It is no joke': Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reflects on Congress as she endorses Sanders\n\nOcasio-Cortez says she had also spoken to other candidates, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ahead of her endorsement.\n\n\"I think she's a fabulous candidate. Frankly, Sen. Sanders, Sen. Warren and myself are all on the same team in the party,\" she said.\n\nWarren is currently outpacing Sanders in national and early-state polls alongside former Vice President Joe Biden. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Sanders is in fourth place behind Biden, Warren and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nUSA TODAY/Suffolk poll: Iowa caucuses are 'up for grabs' as Pete Buttigieg surges into top tier\n\nNationally, Sanders is in third place after Biden and Warren, according RealClearPolitics averages.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/21/bernie-sanders-says-aoc-work-his-white-house/4055445002/", "description": "Bernie Sanders was asked in a joint interview\u00a0if he would consider Ocasio-Cortez to be his running mate.
