(Jason Miller/Getty Images)\n\nThe Golden State Warriors officially kicked things off at the Chase Center on Saturday, hosting the Los Angeles Lakers in a preseason bout to mark their first game at the new arena in San Francisco.\n\nSteph Curry, though, may want to head back to Oakland instead.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCurry, just seconds into the 123-101 loss, jacked up one of his trademark deep 3-pointers from just inside the midcourt logo. His shot, however, was wildly off the mark.\n\nCurry air-balled so badly that the ball didn\u2019t even brush the net as it fell short of the hoop and bounced out along the baseline.\n\nSteph with the heat check \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/P3o1sUV6k6 \u2014 Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) October 6, 2019\n\nCurry didn\u2019t take it too hard, though, and could be seen smiling the entire way down the court as he ran back on defense.\n\nThe Warriors star had nothing to worry about. Nearly four minutes later, after getting used to his new surroundings on the other side of the Bay, Curry scored the first points for Golden State in the new arena \u2014 drilling a deep two-pointer from the wing.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurry finished the night with a team-high 18 points in 17 minutes, shooting 1-of-5 from behind the arc. Jordan Poole added 17 off the bench, and Eric Paschall finished with 11. Those three were the only Warriors to score in double figures.\n\nAnthony Davis\u2019 explosive first quarter\n\nAnthony Davis didn\u2019t waste any time in his first official outing as a Lakers star on Saturday afternoon.\n\nDavis, in just the first 12 minutes of the preseason game in San Francisco, dropped 17 points and seven rebounds \u2014 and had five dunks. The six-time All Star was cleaning up everything inside, propelling the Lakers to a 33-20 lead after the first quarter.\n\nNow, it is just a preseason game. The Warriors had no answer for Davis whatsoever.\n\nThis guy really threw down five dunks in his first quarter as a Laker. @AntDavis23 is something else.\n\n(\ud83d\udcfa: @SpectrumSN & TNT) pic.twitter.com/rlrlMSa8tw \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers (@Lakers) October 6, 2019\n\nIf that trend continues through the year, the Lakers are going to be one tough team to slow down inside.\n\nThe team\u2019s former president of basketball operations enjoyed the show, too.\n\nLaker Nation, I just watched Lebron and Anthony Davis put on a show in the 1st quarter of the Lakers vs. Warriors exhibition game. Watch out rest of the NBA! \u2014 Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) October 6, 2019\n\nDavis finished the night with a double-double 22 points and 10 rebounds, leading Los Angeles \u2014 who never trailed in the game \u2014 to the 22-point win. He seemed to mesh well with LeBron James, too, proving the duo has what it takes to make waves in the league this season.\n\nLeBron \u27a1\ufe0f AD\n\n\n\nCould get used to seeing this \ud83c\udf7f #NBAPreseason pic.twitter.com/BMfh9sBnRk \u2014 NBA TV (@NBATV) October 6, 2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Steph Curry completely air-balled his first shot at the new Chase Center on Saturday in a preseason game against the Lakers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uTP0w6GRylP.TdGidIjcJQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o46K5O1VPOzeC0PHf44hpw--~B/aD0zMjgwO3c9NDkyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/91c14600-e7cf-11e9-abef-30cd34ca94cd", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
