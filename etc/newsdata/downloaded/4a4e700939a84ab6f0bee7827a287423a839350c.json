Before the end of 2019 it has plans to open another eight in the Florida market.\n\nThe three newest stores are located in Key West, Pensacola, and St. Petersburg.\n\nIn this article we'll look at why investors will need to be patient wit MedMen and why it'll take time before it generates a profit.\n\nCurrent cannabis investor expectations and sentiment\n\nWith some of the larger cannabis companies having disappointing earnings results over the last couple of quarters, combined with some negative news associated with poor management decisions, the overall cannabis sector has been punished.\n\nConsequently, the market has started to, prematurely in my view, look for cannabis companies to start generating a profit. That's partly because of the steep losses, and also in response to the accompanying negative sentiment.\n\nWhy I say it's premature is because, for the most part, companies that have been able to generate a profit have been smaller companies with less ambitious long-term goals. They will enjoy some share price strength in the near term, but farther out once many of the larger competitors turn from expansion to profitability, they'll vastly outperform the smaller cannabis companies that have been enjoying share price strength.\n\nMedMen falls into the category of spending on expansion, so shareholders will need to be patient as the company builds out its national footprint in preparation for long-term growth and profitability.\n\nCompanies with aggressive expansion plans like MedMen aren't going to be able to turn a profit until they scale further. That said, they do need to communicate their pathway to profitability. As Aurora Cannabis recently discovered, it's best not to start fixing specific dates when that'll happen, but to lay out the way the company will achieve profitability within its business model.\n\nWhat the company needs to continue to do\n\nSince rapid expansion is a big part of MedMen's business model, it's imperative for the company to prove it can continue to increase revenue as it spends. This is one of the reasons Canopy Growth has been taking such as big hit, as it failed to meet revenue expectations in the last quarter, missing by C$21.27 million.\n\nMedMen, on the other hand, has done well in the last couple of quarters, generating $36.6 million in the third fiscal quarter, and bumping that up to $42 million in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nAnother important part of MedMen's long-term success will be its geographic diversity. In the last quarter about two-thirds of the company's revenue came from California. Over time, the other markets it competes in should reduce its exposure to California as measured by percentages.\n\nWith each U.S. state having different operating guidelines, something that could be changed in California could potentially disproportionately have an impact on the performance of MedMen. Scaling to different states reduces that exposure and risk.\n\nMedMen Stock Could More Than Triple\n\nStory continues", "description": "MedMen Enterprises (MMNFF \u2013 Get Report) recently announced it opened three new retail outlets in Florida, bringing the total number of operating stores in the U.S. to 29.At this time, MedMen has four retail stores in Florida opened, and has licenses to open another 31, bringing the total ceiling in the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/g3Kg13YgseVV77V.2N6zMw--~B/aD00ODI7dz0xNTA4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/0537ead8c43ce5b18bed32aade510a44"}
