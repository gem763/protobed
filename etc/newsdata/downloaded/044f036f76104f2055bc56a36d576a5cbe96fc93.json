What that would mean for British people is that the very worst impacts of Brexit \u2013 the ones that involve food shortages, fuel shortages, medicine shortages and widespread civil unrest (and this is the government\u2019s own analysis) \u2013 would not come to pass.\n\n\u201cHallelujah!\u201d appears to be the word of the hour. What rubbish.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThat there is even a glimmer of a chance that Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Dominic Cummings and the rest deserve any kind of credit for narrowly avoiding the worst iteration of a crisis that is 100 per cent their fault is obscene.\n\nWe have, we are told, moved in to the \u201ctunnel\u201d phase of the negotiations. A wondrously apt phrase, except that, by comparison, the tunnel in which we have spent the last three years has been fairly well illuminated, and the destination at the end is only darkness.\n\nIf UK leaves the EU in three weeks\u2019 time \u2013 still very much an \u201cif\u201d, at this stage, despite the \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d drivel Gavin Williamson and other government ministers are prepared to spout on the radio \u2013 it should do absolutely nothing to conceal the self-evident fact that Brexit represents the most colossal failure of statecraft in this country\u2019s history.\n\nThat should not be a controversial statement, not even for Brexiteers. Of course, for Brexiteers, Brexit is a success, against the odds. But it is nevertheless still true that the UK will have been taken out of the European Union by accident, by a government led by a prime minister, David Cameron, who didn\u2019t want it to happen.\n\nWhether Boris Johnson actually wanted to win the referendum is a much debated point. It is certainly true that he didn\u2019t think he would, and didn\u2019t consider losing an obstacle to his career (there would still have been a Tory leadership election in 2019. He would have been in a very strong position to win it).\n\nAnd it is certainly true that, should we leave the EU on 31 October, we will do so on terms that will be orders of magnitude more economically harmful than anyone ever promised. \u201cI am a fan of the single market, I would vote to stay in the single market,\u201d Johnson said before the referendum.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

We will be putting up barriers to trade with the largest free trade bloc in the world, which also has the immense advantage of being our geographical neighbours.\n\nThe contours of the deal that appears to be forming is one that leaves Northern Ireland effectively within the EU\u2019s customs union, but also able to benefit from any future trade deals the UK might strike. \u201cBenefit\u201d is a word used very loosely indeed. All sensible analysis indicates that barriers to trade that will come in to force by leaving the EU will shrink GDP by up to 7 per cent by 2030. And new trade deals with other countries could mitigate those losses by 0.5 per cent. That forecast is unlikely to come to pass with any real precision, but the idea it could be out by the kind of degree that makes Brexit economically worthwhile is absurd.\n\nAsked exactly what the deal meant, all Johnson would say is this: \u201cI can certainly tell you we will not see anything that prevents the whole of the United Kingdom from taking full advantage of the opportunities of Brexit.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the DUP and the ERG support the deal, if this is what it looks like and should it ever come before the Commons. They have been scathing of similar-looking deals in the past.\n\nIn the medium-to-long term, the real risk such a deal poses to Brexit is altogether different.\n\nThe best hope for Brexiteers, and the outcome forecasted by all major investment banks, is that a negotiated Brexit will not lead to an economic cliff edge but instead open a slow puncture. The latter is arguably more harmful. What Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest hope is that the gradual depletion of the British economy will be slow enough to obscure any real discernible point at which people notice their economic prospects and life chances have diminished.\n\nA cliff edge is a call to action. A slow puncture is not.\n\nBut special status for Northern Ireland is potentially problematic. If a small part of the United Kingdom in effect retains the economic benefits of EU membership despite having left, and flourishes while the rest of the UK declines, it will serve as a Remain call to arms. This is a highly likely outcome. It is why most Northern Irish businesses loved the backstop. For them, it was the best of both worlds. Only a small band of Union Jack-waving unionist politicians disliked it.\n\nThere is a very real prospect that, in the coming decade, a resurgent Belfast will serve as a living, breathing testament to Brexit \u2013 one of the stupidest things any major country has ever done. It will be a reminder that will pose significant problems for Johnson, Gove and the rest, whose last best hope is that the people never quite work out what was taken from them, for no cause beyond their own crushing vanity.", "description": "There appears to be a slight sense of jubilation emerging, even among sensible people, that the very worst of Brexits might be avoided.
