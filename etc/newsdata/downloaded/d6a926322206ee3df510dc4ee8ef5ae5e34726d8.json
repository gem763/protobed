Schumer and Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, questioned in a letter to the IRS whether the NRA\u2019s \u201cinteractions\u201d with Maria Butina, the Russian woman who was sentenced to prison for failing to register as a foreign agent and plotting to infiltrate the NRA and conservative U.S. political groups, and her Russian patron Alexander Torshin \u201cviolated the organization\u2019s social welfare requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecifically, in addition to multiple meetings between Russian individuals and NRA officials that took place within the U.S., NRA officials and donors met with a number of Russian companies, government officials and oligarchs closely connected to the Kremlin during the 2015 trip to Moscow,\u201d the senators said in the letter. \u201cThe individuals and companies involved in the Moscow meetings included some that were the subject of U.S. sanctions at the time of those meetings.\u201d\n\nThose findings were part of a 76-page investigative report that Mr. Wyden and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee released last week that found that the NRA \u201cbecame a foreign asset\u201d for Russia ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nThe NRA last week dismissed the report as politically motivated.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Schumer, of New York, and Mr. Wyden, of Oregon, said in the letter to the IRS that the report \u201cconfirms that some members of the NRA delegation participated in the Moscow trip primarily or solely for the purpose of advancing personal business interests, rather than advancing the NRA\u2019s tax-exempt purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven this report\u2019s concerning findings and other allegations of potential violations of tax exempt law by the NRA, it is incumbent on the IRS to fully investigate the organization\u2019s activities to determine whether the NRA\u2019s tax exemption should be disallowed,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe Democrats said they are concerned that foreign adversaries could exploit tax-exempt groups \u201cto undermine American interests.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
