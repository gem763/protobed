And we were there to support him - which he'd never had before.'\n\nChris said he was heartbroken when the boy told him that he'd never had his bed made for him before and that he'd slept on a mattress in his previous placement\n\nTearing up, he continued: 'I took him to his bedroom, and when I opened the door, he walked into the room and his eyes lit up.'\n\nThe boy went on to tell Chris that he had 'never ever, in my life, had a bed made for me'.\n\nThe care home manager admitted the moment broke his heart, saying: 'I was so welled up at the time I had to walk away because it broke me.\n\n'He'd never had something so trivial, something we all take for granted.

What's going on? How is this possible?\"'\n\nHe added: 'And your own traumas come back to you. Still in our day, in modern times, this kind of negligence is still happening, where a 15-year-old boy is treated like a stray dog.\n\n'And that will never ever leave my mind. And that is what's wrong with our system.'", "description": "Chris Wild, 39, from Enfield, revealed how he welcomed a 15-year-oid boy into his care home.
