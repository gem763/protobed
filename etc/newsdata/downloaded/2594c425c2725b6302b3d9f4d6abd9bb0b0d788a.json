My spouse, who is 74, receives a full state pension as well as superannuation income.\n\nI asked whether I would be eligible to receive a state pension based on my wife's NI contributions, and if so would this be backdated?\n\nI have been in communication with the Department for Work and Pensions. Unfortunately, I have been informed that I do not qualify for eligibility as my wife was born before 5 April 1950.\n\nThis appears in conflict with the advice you have given me. I should be grateful if you would advise me how to progress this situation.\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK YOUR PENSION QUESTION\n\nRetirement income: Can a husband claim a state pension on his wife's full NI contribution record?\n\nSteve Webb replies: When I originally replied to your query in the live webchat last year, I originally thought that you would qualify for a partial basic pension on your wife\u2019s record.\n\nBut having investigated more fully, it seems that your wife\u2019s date of birth falls outside the relevant range and therefore in your particular case you cannot claim a basic pension based on her record.\n\nI apologise for missing this important detail and I'll explain the situation in full below.\n\nThe opportunity for men to claim a pension based on a wife\u2019s record of National Insurance Contributions under the \u2018old\u2019 state pension system was only introduced at the start of this decade and only covers women born between certain dates.\n\nUnfortunately, your wife\u2019s date of birth falls outside this range and so this concession would not apply to you.\n\nHowever, in the unfortunate event that you were to become a widower, you would be able to inherit part of any earnings-related state pension that your wife was receiving.\n\nSteve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below\n\nTo understand why the rules are as they are, it is worth looking at how the state pension system has evolved over time.\n\nWhen the National Insurance system was designed in the 1940s it was based on the assumption that in any given couple it would be the man who was the main breadwinner and his wife would be financially dependent upon him.\n\nAs a result, under the old state pension system, women could claim a state pension based on the contribution record of a husband, ex-husband or late husband.\n\nBut for many decades there was no equivalent provision for men.\n\nAlthough many men have a full pension record in their own right and so have no need to claim a pension based on their wife\u2019s contributions, there are some men (such as yourself) whose contribution record is incomplete for whom this unequal treatment has caused them to get a lower pension than a woman in the same position, or none at all.\n\nMore recently, it has been recognised that it is unfair to treat men and women differently, and the ability of men to inherit state pension or to claim based on their spouse\u2019s record has been gradually introduced.\n\nBut the rules are different for different parts of the state pension system and also depend on when people reached pension age.\n\nFor many years, married women have been able to claim a retirement pension at 60 per cent of the full rate based on their husband\u2019s contributions.\n\nThis is known in the jargon as a \u2018Category B\u2019 pension. But in April 2010 the rules were changed to allow men to claim a Category B pension provided that certain conditions were met.\n\nThe main conditions were that the man\u2019s pension in his own right had to be lower than the Category B rate, his wife had to reach pension age after 6th April 2010, and he had to reach pension age after 6 April 2010.\n\nIn addition, this is a feature of the \u2018old\u2019 state pension system and therefore does not apply to those reaching state pension age after 6 April 2016.\n\nIn other words, men covered by the old state pension system can now claim a partial state pension based on their wife\u2019s record but only if their wife was born after 5th April 1950.\n\nFrom your wife\u2019s age, she would have been born before 1950 and therefore you would not be able to make a claim under these rules.\n\nThe rules on inheritance of the state earnings-related pension (SERPS) are \u2013 fortunately \u2013 more straightforward. If a married woman receiving a SERPS pension dies before her husband, her husband can inherit between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of his late wife\u2019s SERPS pension.\n\nThe exact percentage depends on the date of birth of the person who died as set out in the table on the government website here.\n\nBased on your wife\u2019s age, you would be likely to inherit 70 per cent of any SERPS pension that she receives if you were to outlive her.", "description": "I am a 72-year-old male who receives no state pension due to insufficient NI contributions.
