The House of Commons voted 428-20, with dozens of lawmakers abstaining, for a bill authorizing the election on Dec. 12.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced his party would back the call for an election after he said the possibility of Britain leaving the E.U. in October without a formal agreement was \u201coff the table.\u201d Johnson has been calling for a general election for months. This, after it became clear that without a majority in the House of Commons, a Brexit deal would remain at a stalemate.\n\n\u201cThe Labour Party loves debate, but they also love the end of the debate, and this is the end of the debate and we\u2019re going out there to win,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson, however, is gambling that an election will give his Conservative party the majority it needs to finally pass his plan for Britain to leave the European Union. He has accused his opponents of wanting to prolong the process \u201cuntil the 12th of never.\u201d\n\n\"If I win a majority in this election, we will ratify the great new deal that I have negotiated, get Brexit done in January and the country will move on,\" Johnson said. He told lawmakers in Parliament that they must \u201cgo to the country to break free from this impasse.\u201d\n\nUK MAN DIES AFTER GETTING STUCK ON 290-FOOT SMOKE TACK, POLICE SAY\n\nJohnson had tried to reach an agreement on an election three times before, but it wasn\u2019t until Tuesday that the Labour party switched its position. Corbyn attributed this to confirmation that a no-deal Brexit was \u201coff the table.\u201d\n\nUTAH MAN RESCUED FROM 12-INCH DRAINAGE PIPE AFTER FALLING ASLEEP, BECOMING TRAPPED FOR HOURS: OFFICIALS\n\nThe Oct. 31 no-deal deadline was killed off last week after Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement was rejected by Parliament, forcing him to request a further delay from E.U. leaders. European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted Tuesday that the EU had formally approved the extension. \u201cIt may be the last one. Please make the best use of time,\u201d he added.\n\nJohnson took office in July vowing to \"get Brexit done\" after his predecessor, Theresa May, resigned in defeat. But the Conservative leader, who said just weeks ago that he would \"rather be dead in a ditch\" than postpone the Oct. 31 Brexit date, was forced by Parliament to seek the extension in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit, which would damage the economies of both Britain and the EU.\n\nResults of the impending election are hard to predict. Opinion polls currently give Johnson\u2019s Conservatives a lead over Labour, but there is a strong chance an election could produce a Parliament as divided as divided over Brexit as the current one. Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party could also jeopardize the lead of Johnson\u2019s Tories by splitting the pro-Brexit vote. At the same time, the Labour party faces a threat from the anti-Brexit and left-of-center Liberal Democrats.\n\nConservatives could also be weary of facing the same fate as when May called for an early election in 2017 to try to boost Conservative majority and push through Brexit. The party ended up losing its majority in Parliament and failing to pass Brexit measures.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nVoters in general are fed up with politicians from all sides after more than three years of Brexit drama, and all the parties are worried about a backlash from grumpy voters asked to go to the polls at the darkest, coldest time of the year.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "British lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to hold a December election, in hopes that a switch-up in Parliament will either kill or bring to fruition a final vote on leaving the European Union after the EU extended the Brexit deadline to Jan. 31.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/362eb84d-boris-johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
