Shopkeepers are raising their shutters and the Bar Centrale is doing a brisk trade in brioches and cappuccinos.\n\nUp and down the street, greetings are being exchanged.

By their deck shoes and shorts, you shall know them.\n\nThey\u2019re here for a coffee, of course, but also to pick up yesterday\u2019s Daily Telegraph, stock up on wine, buy cheese and prosciutto for lunch, maybe grab some fizzy water and a few Peronis for the fridge.
