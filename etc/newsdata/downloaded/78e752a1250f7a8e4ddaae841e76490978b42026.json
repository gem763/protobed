He thinks he\u2019s the heir apparent who simply has to show up and voila, all the ballots will waft gently to his feet.\n\nThis was Hillary Clinton\u2019s mistake.\n\nThe fact that pundits have been pointing that out for some time \u2014 pundits and political watchers from both sides of the aisle, mind you \u2014 doesn\u2019t make it any less true.\n\nBiden, by this time in the political race for the Democrat ticket, should be the clear front-runner. He should be leaving his competitors in the dust. He should be laughing and mocking at their gasping struggles to stay in the race \u2014 not fending off attacks from a single-digit polling nobody like Julian Castro and being forced to defend, for all of America to see, his recall abilities.\n\nIt only plays into the perception of Joe as a too-old pol who can\u2019t hang with the younger crowd \u2014 and who certainly couldn\u2019t take his 76-year-old self into the ring with Donald Trump, and emerge the winner. People listen to Biden and start to count out his birthdays, imagining how bad his mind would really be in a year, in two years, in a full four-year White House term.\n\nCamera close-ups on his struggle to keep his teeth in don\u2019t help.\n\n\u201cSo What Was Up With Joe Biden\u2019s Teeth?\u201d blared one headline from The Slot, the day after the debate.\n\n\u201cDental malfunction? Concerns over Biden\u2019s teeth as he struggles to answer debate question,\u201d blared another from the Washington Examiner.\n\nAnd this, from Breitbart: \u201cWatch: Biden Struggles to Keep His Teeth in Mouth During Debate.\u201d\n\nThe day after a debate, candidates generally like to see their policies being discussed, their platforms being debated \u2014 in favorable lights, if possible. But even unfavorable lights can prove advantageous, in the long run of a presidential campaign. One thing they don\u2019t want the press focusing on?\n\nWhether or not their teeth were about to fall out. It has a way of taking the bite out of any policy talk that would\u2019ve otherwise been well-received.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
