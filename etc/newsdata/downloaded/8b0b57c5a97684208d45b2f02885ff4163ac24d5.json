After six up-and-down seasons away from LA and a self-described difficult offseason in his personal life, Howard is energized by the chance to team up with LeBron James and Anthony Davis in a familiar jersey.\n\n\u201cNot too often in life do you get second chances,\u201d Howard said on a conference call in his first public comments about the reunion. \u201cThis is an awesome experience. I\u2019m just looking forward to being the best teammate, the best person in the community I can be. \u2026 Six years ago doesn\u2019t seem like a long time, but a lot of things have happened. I\u2019m just excited.\u201d\n\nHoward said he has repaired his mental state through meditation, reading and introspection. That might be why he didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by the criticism he received online last week from Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. The Lakers greats had a brief disagreement on social media before they united in publicly making fun of Howard, who clashed with the businesslike Bryant during their season together in LA.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cShaq and Kobe are some of the greatest players ever to play this game,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI have nothing but love and respect for those guys and what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish. \u2026 My job is to come here and help this team win. It\u2019s not to get into any fights or arguments with Shaq or Kobe or anybody. I won\u2019t let anything distract me from winning a championship.\u201d\n\nHoward realizes that some Lakers fans may be less excited: He has been booed every time he stepped foot in Staples Center over the past six years \u2013 even by Clippers fans. He hopes everyone will recognize he\u2019s ready to repair his relationship with Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI never had any ill will toward the fans in LA,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI loved this city from the moment I started playing here. \u2026 It was just a decision I made. I love this city. I loved playing in LA. None of that stuff even matters to me anymore. I think we all have a fresh start. I\u2019m big on new beginnings, and this is the time to start up a new time. I\u2019m just looking forward to having a fresh start with the fans and show them my only dedication is to put another banner up here in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nHoward also said he is eager to go back to work after a rough 12 months in his personal life. He hasn\u2019t played a game since November after getting injured early in his only season with Washington, and he didn\u2019t go into detail about off-court problems he has previously described as \u201crock bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just stuff in my personal life,\u201d Howard said. \u201cMentally, physically and spiritually. It had nothing to do with me as a basketball player or anything like that. It was just personal things that I had to deal with which made me stronger.\u201d\n\nHoward wasn\u2019t the Lakers\u2019 first choice to play alongside JaVale McGee and Davis at center, but he won over both big men and team leader Rajon Rondo while trying out for the Lakers\u2019 top brass last month. Howard said he vowed to be a supportive teammate dedicated to team goals, but he realizes public declarations are cheap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather show you guys than say it,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI\u2019d rather my actions be something that you guys can critique instead of my words. I\u2019ve always said a lot of words, but I\u2019d just rather show you guys.\u201d", "description": "Dwight Howard says he is returning to the Los Angeles Lakers with a new outlook on basketball and his place in it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VXYJp6wYwKlb.0sZnhwGSw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tCp29nwTmBZAdWKDlkqLLw--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/f630a4e871d3de92bbcf4d5adccc2585", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
