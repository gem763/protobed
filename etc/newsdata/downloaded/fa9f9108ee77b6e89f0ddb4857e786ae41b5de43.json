Rows of helmet-clad riot police lined some streets, separating Morales\u2019 supporters from protesters opposed to the president.\n\nTear gas was used in at least two locations to disperse protesters.\n\nMorales, who has been in office nearly 14 years and is Latin America\u2019s longest-serving leader, has said the Organization of American States (OAS) will audit the election and that he will go to a second round if fraud is found.\n\nThe Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) and Morales, 60, both deny any irregularities.\n\n\u201cWe, in the most transparent and secure way, confident in the sovereignty of the people, have invited an international audit,\u201d Vice President Alvaro Garcia told reporters early on Tuesday.\n\nA demonstrator is detained by riot police officers during clashes in Cochabamba, Bolivia, October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Danilo Balderrama\n\n\u201cWe have called on the OAS and brother countries so they can clear up any doubt with respect to the malicious campaign of the losing candidate, who refuses to accept the decision of the Bolivian people,\u201d Garcia said.\n\n\u201cWe want to ask Carlos Mesa, the losing candidate, to join the audit,\u201d he added. \u201cWe await a speedy and affirmative response.\u201d\n\nWith 84% of the votes counted on Oct. 20, polling showed Morales was likely headed to a runoff with Mesa. However, when reporting resumed after nearly 24 hours, it showed Morales had pulled off a razor-thin victory.\n\nThe final, legally binding vote tally gave him 47.08% of votes to Mesa\u2019s 36.51%, less than a percentage point more than the 10-point margin needed to avoid a runoff.\n\nMesa told journalists in the industrial city of Santa Cruz he wanted assurances from the government that the results of any recount will be binding.\n\n\u201cAre they prepared to recognise the TSE\u2019s final results?\u201d Mesa asked. \u201cIs the government prepared to back down?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not accept a solution that mocks popular will. We will not accept a solution that turns its back on the Oct. 20 vote and we will not turn our backs on people who are fighting democratically and peacefully in the streets,\u201d he said.\n\nProtesters in the streets lobbed accusations of fraud at Morales.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\n\u201cThe audit doesn\u2019t help now,\u201d said Pamela Velez, 37, as police deployed gas at a barricade in the central part of the city. \u201c(The Morales government) has had a week to fix up (the vote).\u201d\n\nMesa, a former president, told Reuters in an interview on Monday that strikers would not accept negotiations to end protests.\n\nFive protesters were injured by gunshots on Monday in Santa Cruz. Police have said they are investigating the incident.", "description": "Protests over a disputed presidential election convulsed Bolivia on Tuesday as police fired tear gas in the capital and the sitting president and opposition candidate wrestled over an audit of the results.", "authors": ["Vivian Sequera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446337025&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S20K", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
