They will no longer \"Name Their Own Price.\" They will get \"Express Deals.\" (Photo: Priceline)\n\nPriceline will no longer offer \u201cName Your Own Price\u201d rental car deals starting today.\n\nThe online travel agency (OTA)--which gained fame for the so-called NYOP model for airfares, rental cars and hotels--says it will now move to offering \u201cExpress Deals\u201d for rental cars. Rather than bidding on rental cars and finding out later if they have a reservation, travelers will now know their price ahead of booking and will immediately get that booking confirmed.\n\nPriceline already suspended NYOP option for airlines in 2016.\n\nAs of this morning, travelers will only be able to name their own price on hotel rooms.\n\nPriceline\u2019s Express Deals will offer the same deals for rental cars, including some that will provide up to 40% of savings, says Bill Jose, senior vice president of rental cars at Priceline.com.\n\nThe new process, he says, will be easier and faster.\n\n\u201cWith rental cars, we have seen the consumers prefer Express Deals, and as a result we chose to make this switch,\u201d he says. \u201cThe main benefit to consumers with this switch to Express Deals is with speed. Name Your Own Price for rental cars required consumers to bid and wait. With Express Deals, those steps are eliminated.\u201d\n\nWebsites such as Priceline and Hotwire did well with the NYOP model for a while. But hotel companies have pushed back in recent years, offering incentives to travelers who book directly with their websites.\n\nFor instance, those who book with OTAs generally don\u2019t get loyalty program points. And hotels argue that they can deal better with changes to reservations and problems on the ground when they have direct bookings.\n\nThat said, hotels also benefit from unloading unused inventory on sites such as Priceline and mobile apps such as Hotel Tonight.\n\nThe NYOP model won\u2019t completely end for now.\n\nHotwire, one of Priceline\u2019s biggest competitors, has \u201cHot Rate\u201d opaque deals for hotels, rental cars and airfares. For hotels, travelers enter the date, location and star rating they would like. The hotel name is revealed only after they book, and all reservations are final.\n\nIt also has Hot Rate airfare deals. For instance, a search for a flight from JFK to LAX on May 11 produced a deal if the traveler is willing to depart sometime between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. All the details, including the airline, are revealed after booking.\n\nA similar process works for rental cars.\n\nPriceline says it will continue to offer NYOP for hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cPriceline.com does not have plans to move away from Name Your Own Price for hotels,\u201d Jose says. \u201cTravelers see value in that offering and continue to book millions of deals at prices that are not available elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2G80lPc", "description": "Priceline will no longer offer \u201cName Your Own Price\u201d rental car deals.", "authors": ["Nancy Trejos", "Published A.M.
