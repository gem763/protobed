The Air Force would like to see 1,763 F-35 aircraft, but if it costs $35,000-an-hour, how can we afford that going forward?\" Reed said.\n\nBarrett, a pilot and the first civilian woman to land an F-18 on an aircraft carrier, said getting the flight hour cost down would be one of her priorities as secretary.\n\n\"The F-35 is an important element of the arsenal, and we need the capability, but the costs for flight hours seems extremely high,\" Barrett said. \"I would use the background that I have to ... negotiate and build the capability so the aircraft can be flown with less expense.\"\n\nCongress has repeatedly provided money to the Pentagon to develop a light attack aircraft that could conduct operations against enemies like ISIS at a fraction of the cost of other aircraft. The Air Force has spent over a decade trying to determine if it will buy these propeller-driven planes, much to the ire of some members of Congress. Republican Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida threatened on Wednesday to give the aircraft project to the Army if the Air Force can't get the job done.\n\n\"Congress has said we want to see initial operating capability for this kind of light attack aircraft by 2023, and I hope that upon confirmation you can make that a priority for happening since the Air Force has moved somewhat slowly on it to date,\" Cotton said.\n\nBarrett said she would \"look forward\" to moving the process along more quickly should she be confirmed.", "description": "Senators asked the nominee for secretary of the Air Force why the service used its most expensive fighter plane when cheaper options are available.", "authors": ["Russ Read", "Washington Examiner"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a43caca4aa6b5a01a8b6e6c-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
