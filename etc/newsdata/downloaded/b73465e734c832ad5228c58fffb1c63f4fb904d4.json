K.?", "language": "en", "text": "Even in Wales, which voted to leave Europe in 2016, there is evidence of a budding independence movement. While polls rarely show support for it rising above 25 percent, the chaotic politics of Brexit in London have raised doubts among some Welsh.\n\nThe situation in Northern Ireland is more complicated. There is less of a push to break away, though a recent poll by Michael Ashcroft, a British pollster and former Conservative Party official, showed that a bare majority of people there would vote to leave the United Kingdom, if given a choice.\n\nThat is partly a function of demographics: Catholics, who tend to be nationalist, are growing more rapidly as a percentage of the population than Protestants, who tend to be unionist. But it also reflects tensions over Brexit, particularly since the arrival of Mr. Johnson and his threat to leave the European Union, even without a deal, by the end of October.\n\nSinn Fein, the Irish nationalist party that once served as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said that if Mr. Johnson carried out that threat, Northern Ireland should hold a referendum.\n\n\u201cPeople from across this society, even those of a British identity, are now seriously questioning whether there are any merits of staying within the Union after Brexit,\u201d Michelle O\u2019Neill, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein, said during a debate at the Labour Party conference in Brighton, England last month.\n\nIn that regard, Mr. Johnson\u2019s deal is a mixed blessing. Northern Ireland would remain legally part of the United Kingdom\u2019s customs territory, but it would stay closely aligned with the maze of European rules and regulations.", "description": "The proposed exit deal promises to accentuate centrifugal forces that were already pulling Scotland and Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom.", "authors": ["Mark Landler"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/world/18brexit-union2/merlin_162911730_e2b35295-b125-46a9-878b-073f369c9a6f-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
