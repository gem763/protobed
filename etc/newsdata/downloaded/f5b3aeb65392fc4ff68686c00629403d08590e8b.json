It was eventually with the help of Bristol City Council deputy mayor Asher Craig that he was finally granted citizenship.\n\nBut Jashwa has died aged 64, before he had the chance to take advantage of his citizenship.\n\nA special edition of BBC Inside Out airing today follows Jashwa during his battle to call Britain home.\n\nHe told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt as if I was accepted by the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the \u201890s I was travelling but then all of a sudden I hear of people and know people who went out of the country and somehow could come get back in,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cAs a musician what do you do? You travel.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nJashwa moved to Southmead, Bristol, in 1968, where he worked as an apprentice for Rolls Royce before jumping into a career in music.\n\nHe started his solo career in St Pauls as Joshua Moses, recording singles like \"Pretty Girl\" and \"Rise Up\" and releasing three albums.\n\nThe father of five frequently went abroad to perform - but when the UK tightened its borders, all of this stopped.\n\nBack in November Jashwa told the BBC he was confident he would be granted citizenship.\n\nIt better be soon \u2018cos you know I\u2019m an ill man right now. I\u2019m kind of diagnosed with the big C. And even the big C don\u2019t frighten me.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cBut I really need my citizenship fast because I would like to go on holiday somewhere. I don\u2019t know where. Doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cBut just to be free and not burdened with the complexities of politics and politicians.\u201d\n\nBut Jashwa would never get his holiday, nor see the Government compensation promised to victims of the 'Windrush scandal'.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC at a celebration of Jashwa's life, Bristol deputy mayor Asher Craig said she was \"really really shocked\" Jashwa passed away so quickly after being granted citizenship.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cOne thing about Jashwa was that he didn\u2019t want to bring his burden to anybody. So at no time did I even consider that he would be passing away so quickly,\" she said.\n\n\u201cThis whole Windrush situation completely stressed him out and the fact that he was already suffering from cancer with that added pressure on top of it.\n\nAsher said despite Jashwa not being able to use his British passport in life, he would fly \"all over the world\" now.\n\n\"He has been set free,\" she said.", "description": "Jashwa Moses, who was unable to travel for decades through fear of being denied entry back into the UK, has passed away - just months after receiving citizenship", "authors": ["Alice Peacock", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20573317.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jashwa-Moses-who-died-just-months-after-finally-being-granted-British-citizenship1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
