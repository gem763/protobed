Lots of meetings, dreary office buildings and gray skies mean regular caffeine hits are essential in Europe\u2019s de facto capital.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t assume you'll find good coffee everywhere. The complacent coffee hunter is likely to stumble across burnt beans and UHT milk. But fear not, POLITICO has been on a mission to find the best of Brussels\u2019 relatively recent coffee boom.\n\nWe\u2019ve teamed up with some of the city\u2019s movers and shakers for their takes. Whether you\u2019re getting a morning jolt or doing a deal, this is the guide you need to the good caf\u00e9s of Brussels.\n\nThe map below shows our favorites in red and our shoutouts in gray. Use the icon on the right to open the map in Google Maps.\n\nTHE EU QUARTER\n\nCaff\u00e8 Vergnano \u2014 Rond-Point Robert Schuman 7\n\nIs it called Caff\u00e8 Vergnano? Coffee Shop 1882? Or some combination of the two? No one\u2019s really sure, not even the staff, but that doesn't stop it serving as a kind of town hall of Brussels coffee houses. Situated opposite the Commission\u2019s Berlaymont building, and adjacent to the Council\u2019s Justus Lipsius, Vergnano has no shortage of regulars, including Lina Aburous, managing director of Euraffex (a communications firm) and an EU Confidential podcast panelist.\n\nAburous calls in every morning for a cappuccino. \u201cThe quality of the coffee and the atmosphere\u201d make it a favorite of hers.\n\nOriginally from Jordan, Aburous said she found Brussels\u2019 caf\u00e9 culture confusing when she arrived in the city after a stint working in Barcelona. \u201cDo they work,\u201d she wondered, \u201cor do they just keep drinking coffee in this city?\u201d After a while she said she realized \u201cthat every single thing happens over coffee in Brussels.\u201d\n\nOften, she says, people want to escape their offices. For civil servants, \u201cit\u2019s a break for them to get out of their offices. Really, their offices are ugly. That\u2019s why they want to meet you outside!\u201d\n\nThe coffee: Decent. Plenty of tea alternatives available.\n\nThe crowd: Commission staffers, British diplomats and at lunchtime, a serious chunk of the European External Action Service.\n\nThe space: An L-shaped indoor space with tables that seem to almost spill onto the pavement outside, creating a courtyard vibe next to the Schuman roundabout.\n\nPerfect for: Work-related eavesdropping, if you can hear over the coffee machine.\n\nWatch out for: Divulging sensitive information: The hustle and bustle might protect you, but you can be sure someone is listening in.\n\n\u2615\u2615\u2615\n\nDomenica \u2014 Rue de Tr\u00e8ves 32\n\nPOLITICO planned to meet Brando Benifei, leader of Italy\u2019s Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament, in the Parliament's MEP bar. But with the temperature soaring close to 40 degrees, staff at the Astrid Lulling lounge (as the MEP bar is formally known) had packed up for the day.\n\nInstead, Benifei, who at 33 is the youngest head of a parliamentary delegation, suggested Domenica, his favorite \u201coutside\u201d spot.\n\n\u201cThe simple espresso, it\u2019s very good,\u201d said Benifei. \u201cI come here almost every day for at least a coffee,\u201d he added. Proof? Light coffee stains on his white shirt sleeves.\n\nDomenica\u2019s trademark is its \u201cconstant presence\u201d of Italians, according to Benifei. \u201cI always hear interesting things while sipping a coffee here because it\u2019s small, as you see, and everyone speaks loudly.\u201d\n\nHomemade pasta appears at a neighboring table. \u201cThe food is real, genuine Italian food, not Italian food only in name,\u201d said Benifei, and the salads are healthy but tasty, \u201cnot like diet-obsessed people\u2019s salads.\u201d\n\nThe coffee: The flat white is merely OK. Espresso really is the signature drink here.\n\nThe crowd: Italians from all corners of the EU. 5Star MEPs are regulars.\n\nThe space: Small and bustling, with a communal indoor bench.\n\nPerfect for: Networking with Italians during the day (an activity that transitions to Cafe Italiano, Rue d\u2019Arlon 27, in the evening).\n\nWatch out for: A closed sign until 11 a.m.\n\n\u2615\u2615\u2615\n\nCaffelatte Espressobar \u2014 Rue de Commerce 19\n\nHelen Stylianou, Australia\u2019s deputy ambassador to Belgium and Luxembourg and also deputy head of mission to the EU and NATO, visits Caffelatte up to three times a day.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason is the coffee is of an excellent quality,\u201d she says as we wait for flat whites. But she loves the atmosphere too. Francesco and Alex, the Italian brothers who run Caffelatte, \u201cswitch between French, Italian and English. Watching them work behind the coffee bar is great fun,\u201d Stylianou said, stopping to point out a coffee order on its way to a nearby table. \"I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve ordered, but it\u2019s beautiful.\"\n\nThe coffee: Among the best in Brussels. You can get it hot and cold, as well as other options such as matcha latte.\n\nThe crowd: Consultants, European People's Party staff (the HQ is across the road), Australians and Canadians.\n\nThe space: Medium-sized interior plus outdoor tables, but it gets very busy at times. Free water tucked around to the right of the bar is a plus.\n\nPerfect for: A mood-booster; listening to the multilingual staff.\n\nWatch out for: Sizes \u2014 be specific about what you want.\n\n\u2615\u2615\u2615\n\nStarbucks \u2014 Schuman metro station\n\nAura Salla, foreign policy adviser at the Commission\u2019s Political Strategy Centre, has knowingly opened herself up to serious coffee-snob criticism by going on-record as a fan of the American coffee chain.\n\nLuckily for Salla, it was so dark in Starbucks during her POLITICO coffee date that no passing hipster spotted her.\n\n\u201cMy friends love to meet in these hipster caf\u00e9s,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s beautiful and you can take your Instagram. You can\u2019t do that in Starbucks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love my big coffee, you know, the feeling in the morning when you have your big coffee. You feel safe.\u201d\n\nThe coffee: Nothing to write home about, but not Brussels\u2019 worst. Stick to the basic American-style filter coffee, or save for an emergency caffeine hit.\n\nThe crowd: With dungeon lighting it\u2019s hard to tell, but most appear to be Commission staffers and visitors.\n\nThe space: Doomsday bunker-chic, with lots of seating.\n\nPerfect for: Large, American beverages. Convenient if you get the metro and you work at the Commission.\n\nWatch out for: Your vitamin D levels.\n\n\u2615\u2615\u2615\n\nOR \u2014 Place Jourdan 13a\n\nCatherine Bray stops at OR in Place Jourdan every morning before she heads to the U.K. permanent representation, where she heads up the \"Wider World\" team in the foreign policy unit. That's quite a job title. \u201cThe portfolio is quite large!\u201d she said.\n\nOf OR, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s got quite a nice vibe to it ... And it\u2019s not too hipster-y for me [though compared to Starbucks, it's man-bun central]. I like places that are a bit edgy but aren\u2019t trying too hard \u2026 and that give you a bit of chocolate on the side.\u201d\n\nThe coffee: Good, but not as good as the Bourse branch. Also, the homemade lemonades are ideal for washing down the takeaway fries at Maison Antoine.\n\nThe crowd: EU bubble people trying to escape conferences and events in the Borschette building opposite.\n\nThe space: Huge, loft apartment-style caf\u00e9 with exposed brick and concrete walls. Lots of space between tables for discreet conversation. So big you can sit for hours without being bothered by staff.\n\nPerfect for: Relaxing or working over coffee.\n\nWatch out for: Service can be slow.\n\n\u2615\u2615\u2615\n\nKarsmakers Coffee House \u2014 Rue de Tr\u00e8ves 20\n\nAilbhe Finn, senior advocacy adviser at Save the Children (and regular EU Confidential podcast panelist), joined POLITICO in Karsmakers' courtyard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good spot. I like a central tree that provides shade,\u201d Finn said. \u201cYou can sit indoors, outdoors and the coffee\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nFor Finn, visiting Karsmakers was an early Brussels habit. \u201cI remember coming here my first week \u2026 when I had my first real job in Brussels. It has some nice memories for me.\u201d\n\nThe coffee: A step up from most of what\u2019s around Place Luxembourg and in the Parliament itself.\n\nThe crowd: MEPs, European Parliament staff and lobbyists.\n\nThe space: Big back terrace, but chunky, cheap-looking sofas that waste a lot of the interior space.\n\nPerfect for: Quick service, and avoiding the security procedures if you need to meet a Parliament person.\n\nWatch out for: Individual customers hogging whole sofas with their bags and luggage.\n\nOUTSIDE THE BUBBLE\n\nLa Petite Production \u2014 Rue du Couloir 5\n\nThe coffee: Really good, including latte-art. And if filter coffee\u2019s your thing, they serve it here.\n\nThe crowd: Birkenstock-wearers and young families. Suits and laptops are scarce.\n\nThe space: Relatively big, but be prepared to line up for a table on weekends.\n\nPerfect for: Switching off.\n\nWatch out for: Patchy service when it\u2019s busy.\n\n\u2615\u2615\u2615\n\nOR \u2014 Rue A. Ortsstraat 9\n\nThe coffee: The baristas recommend you try without milk \u2014 and they\u2019re right.\n\nThe crowd: Depends on the time of day. A mix of locals, tourists and Brussels passersby in the city center.\n\nThe space: A little cramped given how popular it is. Mezzanine floor, and outdoor tables and benches if you want more peace and quiet.\n\nPerfect for: A morning takeaway coffee on the way to work.\n\nWatch out for: The sugar dispensers are overfilled, making it difficult to serve yourself.\n\n\u2615\u2615\u2615\n\nParlor Coffee \u2014 Chauss\u00e9e de Charleroi 203\n\nThe coffee: The caf\u00e9 that set Brussels on a better coffee course. Come here for smooth lattes and flat whites.\n\nThe crowd: EU bubble and local liberal professionals.\n\nThe space: A narrow caf\u00e9 with a mezzanine floor.\n\nPerfect for: A weekend brunch where good coffee matters.\n\nWatch out for: Closed at random times and for long holiday periods. Check their Facebook page if in doubt.\n\n\u2615\u2615\u2615\n\nMOK \u2014 Rue Antoine Dansaert 196\n\nThe coffee: All-round excellent.\n\nThe crowd: Flemish hipsters and tourists who\u2019ve read about it or dropped in from the nearby Belvue Hotel.\n\nThe space: White minimalist with lots of plants.\n\nPerfect for: Vegan food to accompany your coffee available with oat, almond, soy, cow, or any other type of milk you can think of.\n\nWatch out for: Card payment only.\n\n\u2615\u2615\u2615\n\nMy Little Cup \u2014 Rue de la Croix de Fer 53\n\nThe coffee: Good and strong.\n\nThe crowd: Flemish politicos (the Belgian parliament is next door).\n\nThe space: A tiny indoor space, that thankfully now has outdoor tables.\n\nPerfect for: Escaping the EU bubble at walking distance.\n\nWatch out for: Having nowhere to sit inside during winter.\n\nSHOUTOUTS\n\nLiving Room \u2014 Place Jean Rey 8\n\nWhy go? It\u2019s a furniture and homewares store as well as a caf\u00e9.\n\nCorica \u2014 Rue Caroly 39\n\nWhy go? The smell alone. Over 20 different types of coffee available.\n\nCafe Capitale \u2014 Rue du Midi 45 and Rue Ernest Allard 41\n\nWhy go? Long opening hours and comfy chairs to add to the good coffee.\n\nElvis \u2014 Rue de la Science 14\n\nWhy go? It\u2019s a fun space with great juice and smoothie options.\n\nCherry \u2014 Chauss\u00e9e d'Etterbeek 66\n\nWhy go? The best iced coffee and affogato.\n\nThe Office \u2014 Rue d\u2019Arlon 80\n\nWhy go? A full breakfast and lunch menu. The coffee is the sideline.\n\nFIKA \u2014 Rue de la Paix 17\n\nWhy go? It\u2019s a great midway point if you\u2019re walking to the EU quarter from Ixelles or Saint Gilles, or a nice way to finish a lunch at Place Saint Boniface.\n\nMoka \u2014 Rue des Riches Claires 5\n\nWhy go? Cute hole-in-wall place with great cake.", "description": "Where to get the best brews in the EU quarter and beyond.", "authors": ["Isabella Borshoff", "Ryan Heath"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-452778785-1200x628.jpg"}
