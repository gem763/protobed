Ferguson said, however, that the officer \u201cdid the right thing\u201d and is \u201ca hero.\u201d\n\nVIRGINIA POLICE OFFICER SUSPENDED AFTER TURNING IN SUSPECTED UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT OVER TO ICE\n\nThe Fairfax County Police Department enacted a 2007 policy that prohibits officers from confirming a person's immigration status and detaining them solely based on civil violations of immigration law.\n\n\u201cThis is an unfortunate issue where the officer was confused,\u201d Police Chief Edwin Roessler Jr. said. \u201cWe have trained on this issue a lot. This is the first time we\u2019ve had a lapse in judgment, and the officer is being punished.\u201d\n\nNYC THREATENS UP TO $250G IN FINES FOR USING TERMS LIKE 'ILLEGAL ALIEN,' THREATENING TO CALL ICE\n\nFerguson said the officer did the right thing.\n\n\u201cConfused about the federal law? I don\u2019t think so. I think these sanctuary cities, they overlook this law to protect these people,\" Ferguson said in response to Roessler's statement.\n\nThe driver was released from federal custody after three hours and ordered to wear an ankle monitor. Roessler apologized for the incident and ordered an internal investigation upon learning of it.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe officer involved has been on the job for a few years, Roessler told The Washington Post. He added that the officer did not willfully violate the department's policy with respect to cooperating with immigration officials.\n\nHe said the officer will undergo remedial training.\n\nFerguson's daughter, Amanda Weyant-Ferguson, a 28-year-old sixth-grade teacher in El Paso, Texas, was killed last November.\n\nFox News\u2019 Louis Casiano contributed to this report.", "description": "A father who lost his daughter in a hit-and-run accident\u00a0involving an illegal immigrant expressed outrage Thursday over the suspension of a\u00a0Virginia police officer for cooperating with\u00a0Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-03-at-7.53.22-AM.png"}
