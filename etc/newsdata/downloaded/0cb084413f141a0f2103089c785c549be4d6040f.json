The scaleback came after days of talks with potential investors who had baulked at the initial terms.\n\nMr Gupta's finances have come under increasing scrutiny from outsiders.\n\nLex Greensill, a former adviser to ex-UK prime minister David Cameron, has been at the centre of substantial funding deals for Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance.\n\nGreensill Capital specialises in working capital finance and uses ''reverse factoring'' where financial institutions pay a company\u2019s suppliers early. Rating agency Moody\u2019s has been one of the critics of reverse factoring from time to time.\n\nMr Gupta's GFG Alliance bought the failed Arrium group, including the Whyalla steelworks and a nearby iron ore mine in the Middleback Ranges in northern South Australia for about $700 million in 2017. The Arrium businesses had been under the control of administrators KordaMentha for 16 months after collapsing in April, 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe buyout of the Whyalla steelworks and the other Arrium assets saved about 3000 jobs in the township of Whyalla in northern South Australia. Whyalla has a population of about 22,000.\n\nMr Gupta, who is in Milan, Italy for a world steel conference, said Liberty Steel would be accelerating the \"Greensteel'' strategy of using electric arc furnaces to recycle scrap steel instead of producing all material from scratch. The furnaces would also use renewable sources of energy.\n\nHe said Liberty Steel would be increasingly focusing on ways of harnessing new technology, such as hydrogen generated from renewable power sources, to manufacture steel.\n\nMr Gupta said Liberty Steel would be careful not to chase any one ''silver bullet'' in a gradual transition from existing blast furnaces towards electric arc furnaces.\n\nUnder the new Liberty Steel global structure, Mr Gupta said there would be three main divisions.\n\nThey will comprise Liberty Primary Steel, Liberty GreenSteel and Liberty Engineered Steel.\n\nThe Liberty Steel Group will have 200 production sites around the globe with a total capacity of 18 million tonnes.\n\nMr Gupta said Liberty Steel Group would be the eighth -largest steel producer in the world outside of China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SIMEC Energy arm operated by Mr Gupta will remain a separate entity and among the projects it is involved in is the $1.4 billion Cultana Solar farm in northern South Australia.\n\nThe Cultana solar farm comprises 780,000 solar panels and is located on land adjacent to the Whyalla steelworks.", "description": "The steel baron is putting his 200 plants into one consolidated entity with annual sales of $15 billion and a 2030 deadline for carbon neutrality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_624%2C$y_1059/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/42a70c60844263f584718addae1171ba41fa6c89", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
