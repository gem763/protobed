That\u2019s how Canadian politics works, apparently. It\u2019s not just a ban on assault rifles that his Liberal government is promising either: They pledge to implement a buyback program with a two-year amnesty to take assault rifles out of circulation, and they\u2019re going to hand local governments more power to ban *handguns* too.\n\nWhat happens if a fourth photo of Trudeau in blackface emerges? Total federal ban on all firearms, I thinking.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a Second Amendment in Canada, of course, so the government is free to go as far as it likes. \u201cFirearm ownership in this country is a privilege,\u201d said the Liberal Party\u2019s chief spokesman on gun control to the CBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege earned by people who would adhere to our laws and our regulations. And if they don\u2019t adhere to our laws and regulations, they lose that privilege.\u201d There are gun-rights groups too, of course, and they\u2019re pissed off and vowing to punish Trudeau in next month\u2019s elections: \u201cThis is a really important time for gun owners. It has never been more true than it is right now. This is it.\u201d Is it, though? Canadians were polled on gun control back in May. Result:\n\nA new Angus Reid Institute public survey study suggests six out of ten Canadians want an outright ban on handguns in this country. The support rises to three-quarters of Canadians when it comes to a ban on assault weapons. \u201cAssault weapons both in Canada and especially in the United States are associated with some pretty terrible crimes, some really profound tragedies and so I think we do see a greater level of support for a ban in that regard,\u201d said Angus Reid Institute executive director Shachi Kurl.\n\nThe silver lining for Canadian gun owners is that while polling in the U.S. also often shows majority support for an assault-weapons ban, the majority that\u2019s in favor tends to be far less motivated by the issue than the minority that\u2019s opposed. Right now Trudeau\u2019s party remains favored to win the most seats in next month\u2019s election, although the odds of that happening dropped from 69 percent to 60 overnight after his little make-up snafu emerged. (It\u2019s back up to 63 today). Clearly he thinks the gun issue is a winner on balance for his side, if only by giving Canadian liberals a reason to stick with him during a moment of doubt. Essentially he\u2019s making the same pitch to his own base here as Trump makes to the right in the U.S.: However personally dubious you may find him, remember that he\u2019s your best chance for getting the policies you support enacted. \u201cThoughts and prayers aren\u2019t going to cut it,\u201d said Trudeau at today\u2019s presser, echoing a favorite point of American gun-grabbers after a mass shooting. He\u2019s signaling his virtue to the left in the most conspicuous way he can after giving them a moment of real doubt yesterday.\n\nExit question: Has he explained yet why he chose the *darkest shade of black imaginable* for that Aladdin get-up he put together in 2001? If he was resolved to darken his skin for the role for whatever weird reason, you would think he would have tried to mitigate objections to it by choosing subtlety. \u201cGimme the lightest brown foundation you have. I\u2019m talking \u2018coffee with a half cup of creamer in it.'\u201d Instead he appears to have told the make-up people, \u201cOne word: Tar.\u201d What the hell?", "description": "\u201cThoughts and prayers aren\u2019t going to cut it.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
