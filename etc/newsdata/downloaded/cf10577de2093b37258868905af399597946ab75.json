Now, almost everyone agrees that sex has many purposes \u2013 and benefits.\n\nFew topics arouse as much interest and controversy as sex. This is hardly surprising. The biological continuance of the species hinges on it \u2013 if human beings stopped having sex, there would soon be no more human beings. Popular culture overflows with sex, from cinema to advertising to, yes, even politics. And for many, sex represents one of the most intimate forms of human connection.\n\nDespite its universality, sex and its purpose have been understood very differently by different thinkers. I teach an annual course on sexuality at Indiana University, and this work has provided opportunities to ponder sex from some provocative angles, including the body, the psyche and the spirit.\n\nSex and the body\n\nAlfred Kinsey (1894-1956) was an insect biologist whose alarm at \u201cwidespread ignorance of sexual structure and physiology\u201d led him to become perhaps the first major American figure in the study of sex. The Kinsey Reports, published in 1948 and 1953, presented a highly statistical taxonomy of sexual preferences and practices. Despite draining sex of virtually all eroticism, the books managed to sell about three-quarters of a million copies.\n\nThe intellectual climate for Kinsey\u2019s studies of sex had been powerfully shaped by the work of Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Physician and founder of psychoanalysis, Freud created a model of the human psyche that placed libido or sex drive at its core and postulated that psychological and social life are powerfully shaped by its tensions with the conventions of civilized behavior. According to Freud, failure to adequately resolve such tensions could manifest in a variety of mental and physical ailments.\n\nThe stage for psychoanalysis had in turn been set by Charles Darwin (1809-1882). In \u201cSelection in Relation to Sex (1871),\u201d Darwin argued that human beings are animals, likening differences between males and females in body and behavior to those seen among species such as peacocks and emphasizing female choosiness and direct competition among males. From Darwin\u2019s vantage point, and later that of Freud, even some of the most sophisticated trappings of human civilization reflect basic biological imperatives. The subject of non-heterosexual attraction requires a different account.\n\nAt first glance, sexual reproduction is a puzzle, since each member of an asexually reproducing species can produce its own genetically identical young at a lower biological cost. However, sexual reproduction allows a more rapid reshuffling of the genetic deck, increasing the probability that some individuals will be well adapted to environmental changes. Because human beings reproduce sexually, the foundation is laid for sexual selection, the competition for mates of which Darwin wrote in such detail.\n\nSex and the psyche\n\nThe writer Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) presents a more broadly humanistic understanding of the purpose of sex. In \u201cAnna Karenina,\u201d often ranked as the greatest of all novels, sex provides the foundation for the family. Characters who treat sex as an adventure with no regard to family come to bad ends, while those who devote themselves to family happiness fare well. In Tolstoy\u2019s view, the seemingly mundane joys of family life, made possible by sex, constitute the truest joys accessible to human beings.\n\nConsider Tolstoy\u2019s description of the life of a devoted mother, Dolly, troubled by the illnesses of her children:\n\n\u201cThough hard it was for the mother to bear the dread of illness, the illnesses themselves, and the signs of evil propensities in her children \u2013 the children themselves were even now repaying her in small joys for her sufferings. These joys were so small they passed unnoticed, like gold in sand, and at bad moments she could see nothing but the pain, nothing but sand; but there were good moments too, when she saw nothing but the joy, nothing but gold.\u201d\n\nIn the first book of \u201cAnna Karenina,\u201d two men discuss the theories of love in Plato\u2019s (428-348 B.C.) dialogue, \u201cThe Symposium.\u201d One of its characters, the comic poet Aristophanes, grounds sex in our desire for completeness. Aristophanes tells the story of once-whole creatures who, because of their pride, were cut in two, creating human beings, who now wander the Earth seeking completion in their other half. For Aristophanes, sex represents above all a desire for wholeness.\n\nSex and the spirit", "description": "For millennia, theologians taught that the sole purpose of sex was reproductive.
