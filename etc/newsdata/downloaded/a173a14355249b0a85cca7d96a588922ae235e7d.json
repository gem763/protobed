Rosie, who was eliminated on Tuesday after a tense semi-final, revealed she even had her own \u2018nut runner\u2019 to make sure she didn\u2019t suffer an allergic reaction.\n\n\n\nThe show shared a message from the veterinary surgeon on Twitter, which read: \"The crew were incredible. They managed my nut allergy so well and kept everything safe \u2013 including the awesome NUT RUNNER \u2013 how many people can put that on a CV? They kept all my equipment totally separate and cleaned my bench separately.\"\n\nOver on the GBBO website in a letter penned to fans, Rosie heaped more praise on the team for handling her allergy so well.\n\nWe cannot bid farewell to our baking vet and eggy rubber creator Rosie without showing you her best bits! #GBBO pic.twitter.com/wTQE1emcOI \u2014 British Bake Off (@BritishBakeOff) October 22, 2019\n\n\"I have a nut allergy so I was so amazed that the production team took that on board, had me in the tent and had to adapt certain practices for filming, everyone worked around it so well, the backroom production team were incredible and flexible.\"\n\nThis week, poor Rosie had a bit of a nightmare trying to make Prue Leith\u2019s G\u00e2teau St-Honor\u00e9, and was eventually given the boot.\n\nDespite narrowly missing out on a place in the final, Rosie said her time on GBBO had been an absolute delight.\n\n\"Well I never ever imagined I would get this far,\" she shared. \"Regardless of anything I was so amazed to get to the semi-final, of course everyone wants to get to the final, but I was so happy to get to where I did. I have to say I found it slightly crazy that I got here and overall I have absolutely loved every minute of it.\"\n\nSteph Blackwell, David Atherton and Alice Fevronia will now be battling it out in next week\u2019s final.\n\nGood luck!\n\nLike this article?
