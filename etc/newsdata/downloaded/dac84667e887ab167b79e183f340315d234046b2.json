He has given investigators details statements about his service, and how after being ruled unfit for combat at age 17, he was drafted into an SS detachment and sent to Stutthof, which was near his home town.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In Mr Dey\u2019s case, the reasoning is being applied to a concentration camp rather than a death camp.\n\nProsecutors are confidence it still applies because tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though \u2013 unlike at other installations \u2013 the site\u2019s sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStefan Waterkamp, Mr Dey\u2019s lawyer, asked the court: \u201dWhere does responsibility end? That is the question this trial must answer.\u201d\n\nStutthof was established by Germany in 1939 east of Danzig and was first used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the city.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, gay people and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nFrom mid-1944, when Mr Dey was posted there, it was filled with tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos being cleared by the Nazis in the Baltics as well as from Auschwitz, and thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising.\n\nIn the end, more than 60,000 people were killed there by shooting, starvation or lethal injections of petrol or phenol directly into their hearts. Others were forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, or were sent to gas chambers.\n\nSome three dozen survivors and their relatives have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, as allowed under German law, including New York filmmaker Ben Cohen, whose grandmother survived Stutthof but whose great-grandmother died in the camp\u2019s gas chamber during the time Dey served as a camp guard.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "A former Nazi concentration camp guard has gone on trial on 5,230 counts of being an accessory to murder.
