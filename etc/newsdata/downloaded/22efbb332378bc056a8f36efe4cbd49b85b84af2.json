There\u2019s No Proof It Will Work.", "language": "en", "text": "The Miami Dolphins season began disastrously with a 49-point loss to the Baltimore Ravens. The next week, they marginally improved. They lost to the New England Patriots by only 43 points.\n\nSo what did the Dolphins do next? They traded away one of their best players. Their plan to get better is to get even worse.\n\nThere\u2019s just one minor red flag with this approach. There\u2019s no proof that tanking works in the NFL.\n\nIt\u2019s never been more acceptable for sports teams to be abjectly horrible. They\u2019re willing to sit through the ignominy of losing seasons and count every loss as a win. In the NBA and MLB, fans even buy the promise that all of the misery will be worthwhile because it can produce enough top draft picks and young talent to build a sustainable championship contender in the future.\n\nThis has been one of the most radical ideas in professional sports. Franchises worth billions of dollars have concluded that the best way to drastically improve their product is to begin by doing the complete opposite.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs won their first World Series in more than a century after deciding to be losers in order to become winners. The Houston Astros became the best team in baseball precisely because they historically bottomed out and amassed an abundance of young stars along the way. The Philadelphia 76ers have one of the best cores in basketball after stockpiling draft picks and turning them into Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.\n\nIt looks like it will be a long season for the Miami Dolphins.

For 29 straight seasons at least one-third of the playoff teams weren\u2019t in the playoffs the season before. Most games in a given week are expected to be close. The parity fuels the belief that any team can hope to contend in any season.\n\nThis year looks different, and this weekend shows why. The Dolphins and Jets are favored to lose their games by more than 20 points\u2014the first time in decades that has been the case for two teams in the same week.\n\nThe Jets are bad by accident. The Dolphins are bad on purpose.\n\nMiami was already expected to be one of the worst teams in the NFL this season, and that was before it began unloading some of the only notable talent it had. The week before the season started, the Dolphins traded left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills to the Texans in a deal that netted two first-round picks. This week, defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick\u2014the team\u2019s first-round pick from last year\u2014said he wanted out, and the team obliged by sending him to the Steelers for yet another first-round pick.\n\n\u201cNo one likes losing,\u201d said Chris Grier, the Dolphins\u2019 general manager. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about building a team that\u2019s going to win and compete for championships for a long time instead of being in this one year, and then you fall back for two or three.\u201d\n\nDolphins head coach Brian Flores watches from the sidelines in the fourth quarter of a 43-0 loss to the Patriots.

There\u2019s also reason to be skeptical of the theory behind it: there\u2019s no precedent for this leading to success in the NFL.\n\nFootball teams have been accused of tanking before. They\u2019ve pinched pennies on the salary cap, rebuilt and set an eye toward the future. The Cleveland Browns may be the best example: They stunk, hoarded draft picks and now have one of the most enviable young cores in the league.\n\nBut that\u2019s where the comparisons end and the questions begin. The Browns were already bad before they embraced being bad. The Dolphins were respectable in recent years before deciding to bottom out. They made the playoffs in 2016 and were 7-6 at one point last year. They took a roster that had been somewhat competitive and completely blew it up.\n\nThe Dolphins traded Minkah Fitzpatrick, the team\u2019s first-round pick last year, to Pittsburgh. Photo: Roy K. Miller/Zuma Press\n\nIt also took Cleveland years of being the worst team in the league to amass its talent. They whiffed on top draft picks like Trent Richardson and Johnny Manziel numerous times before finally putting together its impressive roster. Miami, Grier says, plans to turn this around \u201cquickly\u201d and spend money as soon as possible.\n\nThen there\u2019s this: The Browns are 1-1 to start this year and still have their fair share of question marks. So it isn\u2019t even clear that this was effective for a team that didn\u2019t have fanciful ideas of doing it quickly.\n\nThe Dolphins deals have placed them in a strangely challenging position. There\u2019s no expectation that they\u2019ll win now. But they\u2019re betting they can replace the skilled players they\u2019ve given away with even better ones. They have an arsenal of future draft assets\u2014five first-round picks and three second-round picks in the next two seasons. Except to get those, they had to give up players like Minkah Fitzpatrick, who\u2019s just 22 years old and the exact type of player they want to draft. (After that trade, Miami cornerback Xavien Howard\u2014one of the few valuable players remaining on the team\u2014captured the despair when he tweeted a GIF from the final scene of \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u201d when Will Smith\u2019s character looks around the family\u2019s completely empty house after everything has been moved out.)\n\nAnd for all of those picks, just one of those is far more important than all the rest combined: the one they spend on a quarterback. They have been starting Ryan Fitzpatrick and now they may turn to Josh Rosen, a first-round pick from a year ago who Miami traded for from the Arizona Cardinals, before the season.\n\nWhich is why as the Dolphins head to Dallas this weekend, where they\u2019re expected to be trounced by the Cowboys, their most important game is actually in Tuscaloosa: that\u2019s where Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, the potential prize of their tank, will be playing.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Can tanking become an effective strategy in the NFL?\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "description": "The Miami Dolphins\u2019 plan to get better is to get even worse.
