In a statement, Apple chief executive Tim Cook thanked the administration for the exemption, which allows the company to assemble the computer inside the United States.\n\n\u201cWe believe deeply in the power of American innovation,\u201d Cook said in the statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why every Apple product is designed and engineered in the US, and made up of parts from 36 states, supporting 450,000 jobs with US suppliers, and we\u2019re going to continue growing here.\u201d\n\nThe news is the latest twist in the trade-war saga for Apple, which has seen its stock price fluctuate wildly with Trump\u2019s tweets about his negotiations with China. Many of Apple\u2019s products, including its iPhone, are expected to see new restrictions in December unless a deal with China is announced.\n\nWhile many of the components in the Mac Pro still come from China, the move to the United States could be a public relations win for the president.\n\nStill, the Mac Pro is a niche product compared with the iPhone, the iPad, laptops and watches. The lowest-end Mac Pro starts at about $6,000, and the high-end versions, with 28-core processors, could run upward of $35,000, about the price of a Tesla Model 3 electric car. That puts the computer far outside the price range of most consumers, making it a tool mostly for businesses that require vast computing power.\n\nThe previous version of the Mac Pro, which launched six years ago and was recently discontinued, was also built in the United States.", "description": "President Trump has been pushing Apple, which makes the vast majority of its products in China, to build them in the United States.", "authors": ["Reed Albergotti", "Reporter Covering Consumer Electronics"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6VYXDGG6FEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
