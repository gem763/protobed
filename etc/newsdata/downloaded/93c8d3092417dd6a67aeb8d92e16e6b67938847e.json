Bernstein/Getty Images Congress House panels launch investigation into Giuliani's dealings with Ukraine\n\nA trio of House committees on Monday announced a new investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, over his interactions with Ukrainian officials and whether the Trump administration\u2019s withholding of foreign aid from Ukraine had any underlying political motives.\n\nThe leaders of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees demanded information from the White House and State Department regarding Giuliani\u2019s contacts with Ukraine and a decision to hit pause on more than $250 million in security assistance already appropriated by Congress.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn letters to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings charge that Trump and Giuliani \u201cappear to have acted outside legitimate law enforcement and diplomatic channels to coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity.\u201d\n\nEngel, Schiff and Cummings said they found the notion that Trump was enlisting his government to increase pressure on Ukraine and its justice system \u201cin service of President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign\u201d especially concerning as next year\u2019s election pulls closer.\n\nEarlier this year, Giuliani, who served as both a lawyer and public attack dog for the president during former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, canceled a trip to Ukraine after being blasted for saying he\u2019d meet with the country\u2019s new president while there.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Biden has maintained a lead in the Democratic primary of presidential hopefuls looking to unseat the president next year.\n\nThe committee chairmen also accused Trump of attempting to secure the prosecution of Ukrainians who provided key evidence against his onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort in Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nThen, in a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky, the U.S. president focused at least in part on completing investigations of corruption cases there, \u201cwhich inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA,\u201d according to a readout from Kiev.\n\nDays later, Giuliani met with a top aide to Zelensky in Spain, where Giuliani urged investigations into the Biden matter and suggested a meeting between Trump and Zelensky. Though the State Department told The New York Times at the time that Giuliani, who holds no official role in the Trump administration, was there as a private citizen, the Zelensky adviser expressed confusion over whether Giuliani was speaking on behalf of Trump.\n\nGiuliani defended his talks with Zelensky\u2019s aide in an interview Monday, claiming that Biden is staring down \u201cserious ethical problems\u201d but denied that his push for investigations had anything to do with Biden\u2019s presidential ambitions.\n\nHe slammed the Democrats\u2019 probe, calling it \u201camazing that three committees are interested\u201d in his discussions and ripping Schiff and Cummings as \u201cdisingenuous\u201d investigators. He added that the investigation had no possible legislative purpose, dismissing the chairmen as \u201ca bunch of political hacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest telltale sign of that is three committees \u2014 how about one with someone who hasn\u2019t prejudged the case?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said it was up to the government whether they turned over the documents Democrats were requesting but but still asserted that everything he\u2019d done was above board in his capacity as the president\u2019s defense attorney.\n\n\u201cThey may regret they wrote the letter just like they regretted calling Mueller\u201d to testify before Congress, Giuliani added, claiming that what he was accusing the Biden family of \u201cstinks to high heaven.\u201d\n\nAnd late last month, POLITICO reported that the administration has been slow-walking $250 million in military assistance to Ukraine, prompting bipartisan backlash and irking advocates who argue the funding is critical to keeping Russia at bay.\n\n\u201cIf the President is trying to pressure Ukraine into choosing between defending itself from Russian aggression without U.S. assistance or leveraging its judicial system to serve the ends of the Trump campaign, this would represent a staggering abuse of power, a boon to Moscow, and a betrayal of the public trust,\u201d Engel, Schiff and Cummings stated.\n\nThey added that the State Department\u2019s admission it played some role in facilitating the meeting between Giuliani and the Zelensky adviser \u201craises serious concerns that the Department is complicit in a corrupt scheme that undercuts U.S. foreign policy and national security interests in favor of the President\u2019s personal agenda.\u201d\n\nMonday's investigation is just the latest probe into the president or those in his inner circle by House Democrats. The Giuliani-Ukraine investigation joins a slew of others targeting everything from the president's tax returns to his touting of his real estate empire in office to his attempts to silence women who alleged extramarital affairs.\n\nBiden's presidential campaign applauded the move, linking Giuliani's outreach to members of Trump's 2016 campaign who met with Russians offering dirt on his opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn a statement, Biden spokesman Andrew Bates accused Trump of \"abusing the office of the presidency and jeopardizing national security aid to a key ally in order to pressure them to prop-up a comprehensively discredited conspiracy theory.\"\n\nAndrew Desiderio contributed to this story.\n\n", "description": "The committee chairmen also accused Trump of attempting to secure the prosecution of Ukrainians who provided evidence against ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/37/d7/17f10c1d4bc288d265b9c38ad739/190909-rudy-giuliani-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
