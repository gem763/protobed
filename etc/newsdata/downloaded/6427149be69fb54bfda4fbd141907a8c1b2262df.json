The PKK is blacklisted as a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and the European Union.\n\nThe agreement said efforts would also be launched for the return of refugees to Syria \u201cin a safe and voluntary manner\u201d.\n\nAnkara has said some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey can be rehoused inside the safe zone.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/turkey-russia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
