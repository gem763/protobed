There have been almost no inquiries since the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a travel advisory for Korea on Aug. 4.\n\n\"Bookings for travel to Korea for September through November are fewer than half of previous years,\" a staffer said.\n\nReports in the Japanese media about the typically robust Korean protests have scared many travelers off even if they have no particular feelings about the substance of the dispute.\n\nHotels are struggling. \"There were only a few cancellations by Japanese tourists until late July but there's been a drastic increase recently,\" said the manager of a hotel in downtown Seoul. Some 1,500 rooms booked until February next year at nearby hotels have already been canceled, mostly by Japanese travelers.", "description": "Tourism from Japan to Fall Sharply", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/08/09/2019080901444_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-09"}
