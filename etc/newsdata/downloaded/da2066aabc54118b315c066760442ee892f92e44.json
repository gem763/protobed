BABA 0.62%\n\nOn Friday\u2014just days before Mr. Ma steps down as its executive chairman\u2014Alibaba struck two deals with a new partner: NetEase, China\u2019s largest game publisher after Tencent Holdings . TCEHY -0.05% Alibaba will buy Kaola, NetEase\u2019s e-commerce business, for $2 billion. And together with Mr. Ma\u2019s private-equity firm Yunfeng Capital, it will also invest $700 million in the gaming company\u2019s music business in return for a minority stake. Mr. Ma is due to retire from the company on Tuesday, his 55th birthday.\n\nAlibaba likely has its eyes on old rivals with these deals.\n\nKaola is an online platform that sells imported goods such as cosmetics and baby formula. It is the largest player in so-called cross-border e-commerce behind Alibaba\u2019s Tmall Global. Greater scale\u2014the two together make up more than half of the market in China, according to data research firm Analysys\u2014will help lower costs.\n\nChina\u2019s government campaign to regulate \u201cdaigou,\u201d a popular practice in which middlemen buy goods from abroad to sell them back home, will probably drive more sales to officially sanctioned cross-border e-commerce sites like Kaola.\n\nAlibaba got a good price for the website: 0.8 times this year\u2019s sales, according to Morgan Stanley. That is probably because the unprofitable platform has mostly been a drag for NetEase. Increasingly, it had to compete head on with Alibaba, which has ramped up its market share in cross-border e-commerce in recent years. For Alibaba, buying Koala is also a pre-emptive move to prevent its major e-commerce rivals, JD.com and Pinduoduo\u2014both backed by Tencent\u2014from snapping it up first.\n\nWhile the Kaola deal defends Alibaba\u2019s lead in e-commerce, the music transaction is about patching up an area of weakness. Tencent\u2019s three online music platforms\u2014Kugou, QQ Music and Kuwo\u2014have combined monthly active users of 652 million, far ahead of NetEase\u2019s 113 million and Alibaba\u2019s 20 million, according to Bernstein. Alibaba\u2019s infusion of capital probably won\u2019t help them unseat Tencent soon, but it could at least keep them in the game.\n\nMr. Ma may be leaving the behemoth he helped to found 20 years ago, but the old rivalries live on. Investors can expect more such deal making from Alibaba.\n\nWrite to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "description": "The imminent retirement of co-founder Jack Ma hasn\u2019t dimmed the ambitions of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.
