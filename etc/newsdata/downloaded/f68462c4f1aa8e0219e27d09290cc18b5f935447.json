Corbyn is coming under pressure from many in the party, including his own shadow cabinet, to press for a second referendum before an election.\n\nHeckled that he had not voted for an election when Johnson tried to call one twice this autumn, he said it was essential for Johnson to \u201cget an extension \u2026 take us away from the dangers of no deal, then we\u2019re in a position to do that\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe may only be just weeks away from the first Queen\u2019s speech of a Labour government. In that Queen\u2019s speech, Labour will put forward the most radical and people-focused programme in modern times, a once-in-a-generation chance to rebuild and transform our country.\u201d\n\nResponding for the government, Johnson said Corbyn could not make up his mind on whether to back an election and criticised him for changing his position on Brexit.\n\n\u201cHis policy on cake is neither having it, nor eating it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFirst he was opposed to no deal, now he seems to be opposed to any deal. First he was in favour of delivering Brexit, now he wants a second referendum. First he wanted an election \u2013 actually he wanted an election for quite a long time \u2013 now he\u2019d much rather not.\n\n\u201cHe resembles a Janus. A push-me-pull-you facing both directions at once and yet unable to decide for either.\u201d\n\nJohnson dismissed criticism of his Queen\u2019s speech, saying it was a programme for \u201can open, global, free-trading United Kingdom\u201d.\n\nMore than a third of the new bills announced by the Queen relate to arrangements to be made after Britain\u2019s departure from the EU.\n\nOther key elements of a speech widely trailed in advance included plans for tougher jail sentences \u2013 one of seven bills devoted to law and order, a direction that has prompted alarm from prison reform charities \u2013 and proposals to oblige people to show photographic ID before they are allowed to vote.\n\nOn Brexit, Corbyn said the government had had \u201cthree and a half years to get Brexit done and they\u2019ve failed\u201d.\n\nHe said the prime minister\u2019s speech \u201cwas supposed to herald an end to austerity and a new vision. Instead it barely begins to unpick the devastating cuts to public services.\u201d\n\nCorbyn condemned plans to increase sentences for violent offenders, saying judges already had the necessary powers.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cThis legislative programme is a propaganda exercise that cannot disguise that this government has failed on Brexit for over three years, that they are barely beginning to undo the damage of a decade of cuts to our public services, that it does nothing for people struggling to make ends meet, does nothing to make our world a safer place or tackle the climate emergency.\u201d\n\nOn another primary election battleground, health, the main measure outlined was not legislative but a proposal for a new long-term plan for the NHS. On social care, there was a proposal for a consultation.\n\nA series of other bills outlined by the Queen have either already been before parliament or been discussed in depth, for example on domestic abuse, no-fault divorce, a measure to oblige restaurants and other businesses to pass on all tips to staff and tougher regulations on fire safety in high-rise buildings in response to the Grenfell Tower disaster.\n\nOther pledges for future bills covered areas also likely to feature strongly in the Conservative election manifesto, such as increased schools funding and more free schools, legislation intended to help the rollout of faster broadband and an environment bill outlining post-Brexit policies in areas including plastic, biodiversity and air quality.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s speech will be debated by MPs for several days but is unlikely to be approved by parliament, given Johnson\u2019s lack of a majority in the Commons. However, his official spokesman said he would not resign if he were to lose the formal vote on it next week.\n\n\u201cHe is committed to delivering on his domestic agenda, as well as delivering Brexit. If MPs do choose to vote against the Queen\u2019s speech, it will be for them to explain to the public why they are voting against greater support for our public services, for the police, schools and hospitals; why they are blocking legislation that would lead to serious and dangerous offenders spending more time in prison; and why they are standing in the way of significant infrastructure improvements.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to show that it is determined to press ahead with its legislative agenda, the government will table seven bills on Tuesday including on the environment, animal welfare and pensions.", "description": "Labour leader suggests party is ready to back election once no-deal Brexit danger is over", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21aa5fcfd1b9bb1f964497b688432bd5e0784f04/63_92_1722_1033/master/1722.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93db847e1da25c130e2820d29f611d14", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
