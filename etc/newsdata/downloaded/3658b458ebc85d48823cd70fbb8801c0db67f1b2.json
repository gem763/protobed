The two gatherings are hosted in Las Vegas and Hiko respectively.", "description": "Despite the proposed raid drawing the attention of millions, no aliens were freed today.", "authors": ["Paolo Zialcita"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/20/ap_19263435231170_wide-018a5b08c842a0634edb88aa4035e3a20041ccaa.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
