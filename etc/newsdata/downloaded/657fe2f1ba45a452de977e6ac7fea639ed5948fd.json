He added that \"Turbo\" is used by all sorts of products that don\u2019t feature actual turbochargers, including razors.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNevertheless, the topic was a hot one across the automotive media and enthusiast communities following the reveal of the sport sedan, which drew largely positive reactions otherwise. The Taycans offer similar speed, but a shorter range than the closest Model S, but Porsche is promising superior overall performance.\n\nTesla, for its part, has often been criticized for its use of the word \u201cAutopilot\u201d as the name for a semi-autonomous driver aid. On Wednesday, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reiterated its position that the word could \u201cmislead\u201d consumers while retweeting an NTSB report on an accident that occurred with the feature engaged.\n\nMusk's Turbo comment may not have been his only jab at Porsche. On Wednesday he tweeted about automakers that cheat on emissions tests.\n\nPorsche is part of the Volkswagen Group, which was hit with a combined $33 billion in fines for violating regulations.\n\nTESLA MODEL 3 TEST DRIVE", "description": "\"Turbo does not mean what you think it does\"", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
