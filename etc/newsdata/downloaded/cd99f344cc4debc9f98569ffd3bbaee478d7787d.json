We wanted to know what the cause of death was, we waited a long time and we questioned everything.\n\n'We thought Abby was in perfect health and she was. It is such a sad way to die and we have been through a rollercoaster of emotions and we are devastated.\n\n'But we want to express our gratitude to the school and the children, some of them have been so special to us it's been incredible.'\n\nMr Beaumont described his daughter as his 'best friend'.\n\nAbby Reese Beaumont started coughing and collapsed on the kitchen floor of her home in Mold, Wales, on April 2\n\nHe added: 'The way we've brought our children up, they were both very mature.\n\n'When Abby died, it was more like losing a friend. That's the kind of relationship we had.\n\n'Abby was beautiful, outgoing and confident but nice and caring with it and she always looked out for younger children.\n\n'She loved languages and could speak French and Welsh fluently.\n\n'She was doing remarkably well at school and had only just started talking about what she wanted to do with her future.\n\n'We always spent Saturday afternoons together when we'd go out for a meal as a family.\n\n'Abby was happy to be among friends and was equally happy in her own company.\n\n'She didn't always feel the need to have to surround herself with lots of friends but the amount of people who came to us after she died proved how many people it had affected far and wide and how much she was loved by so many.'\n\nA full inquest into Abby's death will be held next year.", "description": "Abby Reese Beaumont started coughing and collapsed on the kitchen floor of her home in Mold, Wales.
