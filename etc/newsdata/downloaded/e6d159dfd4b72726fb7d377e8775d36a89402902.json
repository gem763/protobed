Like, if you happen to become an assistant director of a future Downton Abbey film: Do not walk up to her, give her notes while standing half an inch away from her face, or even attempt some light touching. Because as Downton\u2019s Elizabeth McGovern and Allen Leech amusingly revealed last week, Smith got fed up with an overly chummy staffer while they were shooting the film, and had to resort to using her Dowager Countess cane to banish his presence. \u201cAs she would see him coming, she would go, Here he fucking comes,\u201d Leech said, reenacting her whacking technique. \u201cThat\u2019s far enough, that\u2019s far enough!\u201d\n\nRelated", "description": "On Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Downton Abbey\u2019s Elizabeth McGovern and Allen Leech admitted Maggie Smith did something amusing to a staffer.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/15/22-maggie.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
