They finished the game with 10 men after teenager Phil Foden received a second yellow card on 83 minutes.\n\nAtalanta showed admirable ambition in the opening stages and were rewarded on 28 minutes. Malinovsky converted the penalty after Fernandinho had brought down Josip Ilicic just inside the box.\n\nIf City were rattled by going behind, they did not show it and instead lifted the tempo of their play.\n\nThey were level six minutes later when Sterling\u2019s magnificent cross was turned into the net from close-range by Aguero.\n\nSterling won a penalty when his surging run was illegally stopped by defender Andrea Masiello for the second clear spot-kick of the night.\n\nAguero drilled the ball low into the left-hand corner for the lead, but the half ended on a sour note when City\u2019s makeshift centre-back Rodri limped off with a hamstring problem to be replaced by John Stones, himself only just back from a thigh problem.\n\nSterling got the goal his performance richly deserved on 58 minutes as Kevin De Bruyne picked out Foden in the box and the latter\u2019s lay-off was easy for the winger to finish.\n\nFive minutes later and he had another. Played into space on the left, he turned inside the covering defender and provided an emphatic finish, before his hat-trick was complete when he poked home a Riyad Mahrez cross from close-range.\n\nSterling should have had a fourth too when Foden\u2019s excellent pass sent him clear on goal, but he put the ball the wrong side of the post.", "description": "Raheem Sterling scored an 11-minute hat-trick and had a hand in all five goals as Manchester City came from behind to thump Italian side Atalanta 5-1 in their Champions League Group C encounter on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443875572&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1YB", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
