Ellen Degeneres had Parker on her show. The former first lady invited her over to dance.\n\nA star was born.\n\nNow, with the help of her mother Jessica, Parker is for the first time giving a behind-the-scenes account of the seminal moment in her very short life by penning \u2013 or crayoning \u2013 \u201cParker Looks Up,\u201d an illustrated children\u2019s book being released Tuesday by a Simon and Schuster imprint.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParker agreed to a sit-down interview in exchange for a croissant.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t just write it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wrote it.\u201d\n\nHow long did it take?\n\n\u201cIt was a few months,\u201d she guessed.\n\nWhat was the hardest part?\n\n\u201cWriting it,\u201d she said.\n\nWhy is her story so important?\n\n\u201cIt inspired everybody,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, it did.\n\nAs the image went viral, viewers marveled at the wonder on Parker\u2019s face as the pint-sized black girl gazed at the first African American first lady in U.S. history. \u201cThis is what America is all about,\u201d someone tweeted. \u201cThis young girl can now dream about being someone like Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cParker Looks Up\u201d reveals just how happenstance the moment was. That early March day had been dreary and rainy. Parker, then 2, skipped dance class to visit the museum with her even littler sister Ava. There, they met up with Parker\u2019s best friend Gia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnce inside,\u201d Parker and her mom write, \u201cthe friends hurried down a long hall, looking at the paintings all around them.\u201d\n\nPrancing horses. Bushy mustaches. Native Americans.\n\nOf course, they found the play room.\n\n\u201cAfter Gia stuck purple hair onto the easel and Parker added a pirate hat and sunglasses, it was time to go home,\u201d the book says.\n\nOn the way out, the girls spotted a portrait of dancers in tutus. Tutus! They raced to see them. Then Parker saw Obama.\n\n\u201cShe froze in her tracks, spellbound,\u201d the book says.\n\nAnd she still is.\n\n\u201cMichelle Obama inspired me,\u201d Parker said in her interview as a group of non-author children gathered for story time. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m inspiring the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nProfound.\n\nThen the interview veered off course.\n\nParker: \u201cGuess what I\u2019m gonna be for Halloween?\u201d\n\nThis reporter: \u201cA donut?\u201d\n\nParker: \u201cNo! I\u2019m gonna be a cheeeeeerleader!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe author had another question.\n\n\u201cWhen are we doing our interview?\u201d she said.\n\nReporter and mom laugh.\n\nThis reporter: \u201cOkay, let\u2019s start it right now.\u201d\n\nParker: \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nThis reporter: \u201cWhat do you normally do every day? What\u2019s your life like?\u201d\n\nParker: \u201cI got a mermaid costume.\u201d\n\nHer favorite book? \u201cParker Looks Up,\u201d of course. Her second favorite: \u201cMouse Loves Fall.\u201d But also \u201cMouse Loves Spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a my favorite book,\u201d Parker says. \u201cIt\u2019s Simon and Schuster, too.\u201d\n\nThen someone handed her \u201cMouse Loves Fall.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI told you it\u2019s real,\u201d Parker said. \u201cNow can I have my croissant?\u201d\n\nNot yet. Parker sighed.\n\nThen she strolled away for a bit, allowing her mother, a 31-year-old stay-at-home mom who blogs about parenthood from the family\u2019s home near the library, to tell the back story to the back-story book.\n\nAfter the photo went viral, Parker got a manager and a literary agent. Karen Nagel, a longtime children\u2019s editor with Simon and Schuster, got in touch. The picture touched her deeply. A children\u2019s book would be perfect to not only inspire children, but to also preserve the moment for Parker and provide some money for future.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think we listen to children enough for their perception their wisdom and their truth,\u201d Nagel said. \u201cThis experience speaks to Parker\u2019s truth and literally to the first time she saw herself. There is just a profound awareness of that transcends the everyday. You take the personal and make it universal. And I hope that\u2019s what this book does.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSimon and Schuster is expecting strong demand for the book, with a first printing of more than 70,000 copies.\n\nParker, who attends a pre-k where she is learning Chinese, returned to the table with a \u201cFancy Nancy\u201d book. She had another question for this reporter: \u201cDo you know how to read?\u201d\n\nThis reporter: \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just learning.\u201d\n\nParker: \u201cWould you read it to me?\u201d\n\nAt this point, Parker plopped down in this reporter\u2019s lap. He reads the book, of course. They get to the word \u201cboutique\u201d as Nancy continues on in one of her fancy adventures.\n\nAD\n\nThis reporter: \u201cDo you like fancy stores?\u201d\n\nParker: \u201cOne day I went to Las Vegas and guess what? I passed a Coco Chanel store. Then I told my mommy and I went in. I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis reporter: \u201cCoco Chanel is hard to resist.\u201d\n\nParker: \u201cThey gave me a bag and a sticker.\u201d\n\nThis reporter: \u201cNo way!\u201d\n\nParker: \u201cYes way!\u201d\n\nWith nap time looming, Parker had time for just a couple more questions \u2013 such as what she\u2019s going to be when she grows up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be president and everybody\u2019s gonna put my photo up,\u201d she said. \u201cGuess what?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe night before she had an amazing dream.\n\n\u201cI was in the Michelle Obama portrait.\u201d\n\nParker paused for reflection.\n\n\u201cNow can I eat my crossiant?\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A photo of Parker Curry gazing at Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait hijacked the internet.
