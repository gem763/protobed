A few have said he should be only temporarily suspended to quell any unrest. Very few said he should be allowed to continue to use the service without repercussions if he was no longer the president. One high-level government official asked me what I would do. My answer: I would never have let it get this bad to begin with.\n\nNow my hypothetical game has come much closer to reality. In using a quote to hide behind what he was actually trying to say, Mr. Trump was testing the system, using a tactic that is enormously dangerous.\n\nIt\u2019s important to stress that what Mr. Trump is doing is no different from what various autocrats and haters around the world are doing with social media platforms to push their malevolent agendas. With this latest move by the troller in chief, with no reaction from Twitter, it\u2019s official that the medium has been hijacked by those who want to take advantage of its porous and sloppy rules.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kara Swisher", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Civil-War.Html"], "top_image": ""}
