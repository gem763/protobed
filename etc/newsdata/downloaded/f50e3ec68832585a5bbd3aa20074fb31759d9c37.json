It is a riveting movie, propelled forward by Damon\u2019s innovative attempts to survive in an abandoned research station while a heroic rescue mission is undertaken. It is also one huge wet kiss to the Chinese government. In the film, the Chinese space agency is portrayed reverentially as it collaborates with NASA on various rescue ideas.\n\nYou don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out why Western audiences were compelled to take in a little propaganda. The world's most populous nation is the biggest film market. And its authoritarian government is very picky about what films it allows in.\n\nNo country has demanded more of companies in return for access to its markets. In addition to movies getting made or altered with Chinese censors in mind, a string of companies \u2014 including major airlines and hotel chains \u2014 have engaged in ridiculous and embarrassing acts of contrition, often pertaining to that unmentionable democratic nation that most of the world knows as Taiwan.\n\nBut the uproar over a now deleted tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, in support of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters, has taken the issue to a whole new level. It's bad enough when Chinese authorities restrict the speech of their own citizens; it's worse when they try to police Americans' free expression.\n\nAfter Morey's tweet, the Chinese authorities allowed an exhibition game between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers to go on as scheduled in Shanghai on Thursday. But they took down promotional billboards and pulled the game from television.\n\nActivists at an NBA exhibition basketball game between the Washington Wizards and the Guangzhou Loong Lions on Oct. 9, 2019.

Not only are American companies expected to bend to the government\u2019s way in China (which includes tech companies that assist in its internet censorship), now they are expected to be China\u2019s speech police in democratic countries.\n\nThat is, in a word, repulsive.\n\nAt least Morey received sufficient support from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver who, to his credit, said that the league would adhere to American values. The NBA has been hugely popular in China at least since 2002, when star center Yao Ming joined the Rockets, and so has a lot to lose by pushing back.\n\nOn the other hand, the NBA has a lot of leverage, because there is no other basketball league of its caliber, and hundreds of millions of Chinese fans will be upset if it is banned.\n\nNow it will be up to other businesses to show at least as much spine.\n\nFor decades, business has preached the benefits of engagement with China. These benefits include cheaper consumer goods for Americans, a more competitive supply chain for American companies and entree to the world\u2019s largest market. Besides, their argument goes, free trade and free enterprise beget other forms of freedom.\n\nThings have not played out that way. China has refused to loosen up at home and has become increasingly belligerent abroad. It's time for U.S. business interests to push back harder against efforts to extend the \"Great Firewall of China\" outside the nation's borders.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.
