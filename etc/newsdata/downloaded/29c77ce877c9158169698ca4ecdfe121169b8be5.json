Identifying and correcting these discrepancies will prevent approximately $1.4 million in additional improper payments after death over the next 12 months. We also identified 33,258 non-beneficiaries who were deceased according to Puerto Rico Department of Health vital records but whose death information was not in SSA\u2019s Numident [\u201cNumerical Identification System,\u201d is the Social Security Administration\u2019s computer database file of an abstract of the information contained in an application for a United States Social Security number]. We could not determine why the deaths were not in SSA\u2019s Numident or whether Puerto Rico reported the deaths to SSA. Implementing EDR [Electronic Death Registration] should help ensure Puerto Rico deaths are properly and timely reported to SSA. The Numident contained death information for two of the four representative payees; however, SSA had not replaced the representative payees. In several prior audits, we found SSA did not always replace representative payees after it posted death information to their Numident records.\n\nThe Inspector General recommended that the Social Security Administration \u201ctake action\u201d to identify the 149 deceased beneficiaries and representative payees and to add more than 33,000 deceased non-beneficiaries to its database.\n\n\u201cSSA agreed with our recommendations,\u201d the report stated.\n\nBreitbart News asked the administration\u2019s press office via email three questions:\n\n1. Have any of these recommendations been put in place at SS? Take action on the 149 deceased beneficiaries we identified. Take action on the four deceased representative payees we identified. Take action on the 33,258 deceased non-beneficiaries we identified to add their deaths to the Numident, as appropriate. 2. Have any funds been recovered? 3. Has an EDR for Puerto Rico been put in place?\n\nBreitbart News followed up on its inquiry with five phone calls to the press office and extended the deadline for responding several times. The final deadline was noon Tuesday.\n\nIn the OIG report the objectives and background reads, in part:\n\nTo (1) determine whether the Social Security Administration (SSA) made payments to beneficiaries and representative payees who were deceased according to Puerto Rico Department of Health vital records and (2) identify non-beneficiaries who were deceased according to Puerto Rico vital records but whose death information did not appear in SSA records. Puerto Rico Department of Health provided us a vital records data file of the personally identifiable information of approximately 568,000 numberholders who died in Puerto Rico from January 1992 through December 2016. We matched the data against SSA payment records and Numident.\n\n\u201cThe Social Security Administration assigns Social Security numbers, and administers the Social Security retirement, survivors, and disability insurance programs,\u201d the federal USA.gov website stated. \u201cThey also administer the Supplemental Security Income program for the aged, blind, and disabled.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "An Inspector General report for the Social Security Administration reveals $11.6 million in payments were made to dead people in Puerto Rico.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Social-Security-Payments-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
