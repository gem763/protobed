He\u2019s as well or better qualified than the modellers he criticises \u2014 the ones whose Year 2100 forebodings of 4degC warming have set the world to spending $US1.5 trillion a year to combat CO2 emissions.\n\nThe iconoclast is Dr. Mototaka Nakamura. In June he put out a small book in Japanese on \u201cthe sorry state of climate science\u201d. It\u2019s titled Confessions of a climate scientist: the global warming hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis, and he is very much qualified to take a stand. From 1990 to 2014 he worked on cloud dynamics and forces mixing atmospheric and ocean flows on medium to planetary scales. His bases were MIT (for a Doctor of Science in meteorology), Georgia Institute of Technology, Goddard Space Flight Centre, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Duke and Hawaii Universities and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology. He\u2019s published about 20 climate papers on fluid dynamics.[i]\n\nToday\u2019s vast panoply of \u201cglobal warming science\u201d is like an upside down pyramid built on the work of a few score of serious climate modellers. They claim to have demonstrated human-derived CO2 emissions as the cause of recent global warming and project that warming forward. Every orthodox climate researcher takes such output from the modellers\u2019 black boxes as a given.\n\nA fine example is from the Australian Academy of Science\u2019s explanatory booklet of 2015. It claims, absurdly, that the models\u2019 outputs are \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d for human-caused warming.[ii] Specifically, it refers to model runs with and without human emissions and finds the \u201cwith\u201d variety better matches the 150-year temperature record (which itself is a highly dubious construct). Thus satisfied, the Academy then propagates to the public and politicians the models\u2019 forecasts for disastrous warming this century.\n\nNow for Dr Nakamura\u2019s expert demolition of the modelling. There was no English edition of his book in June and only a few bits were translated and circulated. But Dr Nakamura last week offered via a free Kindle version his own version in English. It\u2019s not a translation but a fresh essay leading back to his original conclusions.\n\nThe temperature forecasting models trying to deal with the intractable complexities of the climate are no better than \u201ctoys\u201d or \u201cMickey Mouse mockeries\u201d of the real world, he says. This is not actually a radical idea. The IPCC in its third report (2001) conceded (emphasis added),\n\nIn climate research and modelling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible. (Chapter 14, Section 14.2.2.2. )]\n\nSomehow that official warning was deep-sixed by the alarmists. Now Nakamura has found it again, further accusing the orthodox scientists of \u201cdata falsification\u201d by adjusting previous temperature data to increase apparent warming \u201cThe global surface mean temperature-change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the public,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe climate models are useful tools for academic studies, he says. However, \u201cthe models just become useless pieces of junk or worse (worse in a sense that they can produce gravely misleading output) when they are used for climate forecasting.\u201d The reason:\n\nThese models completely lack some critically important climate processes and feedbacks, and represent some other critically important climate processes and feedbacks in grossly distorted manners to the extent that makes these models totally useless for any meaningful climate prediction.\n\nI myself used to use climate simulation models for scientific studies, not for predictions, and learned about their problems and limitations in the process.\n\nNakamura and colleagues even tried to patch up some of the models\u2019 crudeness\n\n\u2026so I know the workings of these models very well \u2026 For better or worse I have more or less lost interest in the climate science and am not thrilled to spend so much of my time and energy in this kind of writing beyond the point that satisfies my own sense of obligation to the US and Japanese taxpayers who financially supported my higher education and spontaneous and free research activity. So please expect this to be the only writing of this sort coming from me.\n\nI am confident that some honest and courageous, true climate scientists will continue to publicly point out the fraudulent claims made by the mainstream climate science community in English. I regret to say this but I am also confident that docile and/or incompetent Japanese climate researchers will remain silent until the \u2019mainstream climate science community\u2019 changes its tone, if ever.\n\nHe projects warming from CO2 doubling, \u201caccording to the true experts\u201d, to be only 0.5degC. He says he doesn\u2019t dispute the possibility of either catastrophic warming or severe glaciation since the climate system\u2019s myriad non-linear processes swamp \u201cthe toys\u201d used for climate predictions. Climate forecasting is simply impossible, if only because future changes in solar energy output are unknowable. As to the impacts of human-caused CO2, they can\u2019t be judged \u201cwith the knowledge and technology we currently possess.\u201d\n\nOther gross model simplifications include\n\n# Ignorance about large and small-scale ocean dynamics\n\n# A complete lack of meaningful representations of aerosol changes that generate clouds.\n\n# Lack of understanding of drivers of ice-albedo (reflectivity) feedbacks: \u201cWithout a reasonably accurate representation, it is impossible to make any meaningful predictions of climate variations and changes in the middle and high latitudes and thus the entire planet.\u201d\n\n# Inability to deal with water vapor elements\n\n# Arbitrary \u201ctunings\u201d (fudges) of key parameters that are not understood\n\nConcerning CO2 changes he says,\n\nI want to point out a simple fact that it is impossible to correctly predict even the sense or direction of a change of a system when the prediction tool lacks and/or grossly distorts important non-linear processes, feedbacks in particular, that are present in the actual system \u2026\n\n\u2026 The real or realistically-simulated climate system is far more complex than an absurdly simple system simulated by the toys that have been used for climate predictions to date, and will be insurmountably difficult for those na\u00efve climate researchers who have zero or very limited understanding of geophysical fluid dynamics. I understand geophysical fluid dynamics just a little, but enough to realize that the dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans are absolutely critical facets of the climate system if one hopes to ever make any meaningful prediction of climate variation.\n\nSolar input, absurdly, is modelled as a \u201cnever changing quantity\u201d. He says, \u201cIt has only been several decades since we acquired an ability to accurately monitor the incoming solar energy. In these several decades only, it has varied by one to two watts per square metre. Is it reasonable to assume that it will not vary any more than that in the next hundred years or longer for forecasting purposes? I would say, No.\u201d\n\nGood modelling of oceans is crucial, as the slow ocean currents are transporting vast amounts of heat around the globe, making the minor atmospheric heat storage changes almost irrelevant. For example, the Gulf Stream has kept western Eurasia warm for centuries. On time scales of more than a few years, it plays a far more important role on climate than atmospheric changes. \u201cIt is absolutely vital for any meaningful climate prediction to be made with a reasonably accurate representation of the state and actions of the oceans.\u201d In real oceans rather than modelled ones, just like in the atmosphere, the smaller-scale flows often tend to counteract the effects of the larger-scale flows. Nakamura spent hundreds of hours vainly trying to remedy the flaws he observed, concluding that the models \u201cresult in a grotesque distortion of the mixing and transport of momentum, heat and salt, thereby making the behaviour of the climate simulation models utterly unrealistic\u2026\u201d\n\nProper ocean modelling would require a tenfold improvement in spatial resolution and a vast increase in computing power, probably requiring quantum computers. If or when quantum computers can reproduce the small-scale interactions, the researchers will remain out of their depth because of their traditional simplifying of conditions.\n\nKey model elements are replete with \u201ctunings\u201d i.e. fudges. Nakamura explains how that trick works\n\nThe models are \u2018tuned\u2019 by tinkering around with values of various parameters until the best compromise is obtained. I used to do it myself. It is a necessary and unavoidable procedure and not a problem so long as the user is aware of its ramifications and is honest about it. But it is a serious and fatal flaw if it is used for climate forecasting/prediction purposes.\n\nOne set of fudges involves clouds.\n\nAd hoc representation of clouds may be the greatest source of uncertainty in climate prediction. A profound fact is that only a very small change, so small that it cannot be measured accurately\u2026in the global cloud characteristics can completely offset the warming effect of the doubled atmospheric CO2.\n\nTwo such characteristics are an increase in cloud area and a decrease in the average size of cloud particles.\n\nAccurate simulation of cloud is simply impossible in climate models since it requires calculations of processes at scales smaller than 1mm.\u201d Instead, the modellers put in their own cloud parameters. Anyone studying real cloud formation and then the treatment in climate models would be \u201cflabbergasted by the perfunctory treatment of clouds in the models.\n\nNakamura describes as \u201cmoronic\u201d the claims that \u201ctuned\u201d ocean models are good enough for climate predictions. That\u2019s because, in tuning some parameters, other aspects of the model have to become extremely distorted. He says a large part of the forecast global warming is attributed to water vapor changes, not CO2 changes. \u201cBut the fact is this: all climate simulation models perform poorly in reproducing the atmospheric water vapor and its radiative forcing observed in the current climate\u2026 They have only a few parameters that can be used to \u2018tune\u2019 the performance of the models and (are) utterly unrealistic.\u201d Positive water vapor feedbacks from CO2 increases are artificially enforced by the modelers. They neglect other reverse feedbacks in the real world, and hence they exaggerate forecast warming.\n\nThe supposed measuring of global average temperatures from 1890 has been based on thermometer readouts barely covering 5 per cent of the globe until the satellite era began 40-50 years ago. \u201cWe do not know how global climate has changed in the past century, all we know is some limited regional climate changes, such as in Europe, North America and parts of Asia.\u201d This makes meaningless the Paris targets of 1.5degC or 2degC above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHe is contemptuous of claims about models being \u201cvalidated\u201d, saying the modellers are merely \u201ctrying to construct narratives that justify the use of these models for climate predictions.\u201d And he concludes,\n\nThe take-home message is (that) all climate simulation models, even those with the best parametric representation scheme for convective motions and clouds, suffer from a very large degree of arbitrariness in the representation of processes that determine the atmospheric water vapor and cloud fields. Since the climate models are tuned arbitrarily \u2026there is no reason to trust their predictions/forecasts.\n\nWith values of parameters that are supposed to represent many complex processes being held constant, many nonlinear processes in the real climate system are absent or grossly distorted in the models. It is a delusion to believe that simulation models that lack important nonlinear processes in the real climate system can predict (even) the sense or direction of the climate change correctly.\n\nI was distracted from his message because the mix of Japanese and English scripts in the book kept crashing my Kindle software. Still, I persevered. I recommend you do too. There\u2019s at least $US30 trillion ($US30,000, 000,000,000) hanging on this bunfight.\n\nTony Thomas\u2019s new book, The West: An insider\u2019s tale \u2013 A romping reporter in Perth\u2019s innocent \u201960s is available from Boffins Books, Perth, the Royal WA Historical Society (Nedlands) and online here\n\n[i] They include (to give you the flavor)\n\n# \u201cDestabilisation of thermohaline circulation by atmospheric eddy transports\u201d\n\n#\u201cEffects of the ice-albedo [reflectivity] and runoff feedbacks on the thermohaline circulation\u201d\n\n# \u201cDiagnoses of an eddy-resolving Atlantic Ocean model simulation in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream\u201d\n\n# \u201cA simulation study of the 2003 heat wave in Europe\u201d\n\n# \u201cImpacts of SST [sea surface temperature] anomalies in the Agulhas Current System on the climate variations in the southern Africa and its vicinity.\u201d\n\n# \u201cGreenland sea surface temperature changes and accompanying changes in the north hemispheric climate.\u201d\n\n[ii] \u201cClimate models allow us to understand the causes of past climate changes, and to project climate change into the future. Together with physical principles and knowledge of past variations, models provide compelling evidence that recent changes are due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere \u2026 Using climate models, it is possible to separate the effects of the natural and human-induced influences on climate. Models can successfully reproduce the observed warming over the last 150 years when both natural and human influences are included, but not when natural influences act alone.\u201d A footnote directs to a study by 15 modellers cited in the 2015 IPCC report.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jim Campbell", "Greg Williams", "En Passant", "Alice Thermopolis", "Stephen Due", "Les Kovari", "Doubting Thomas", "Mark Pawelek", "Starting At", "A Year"], "top_image": "https://quadrant.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-quad-big-III-32x32.png"}
