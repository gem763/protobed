So far, very few have returned to an enclave Turkey already took over and has controlled since 2017.\n\nAid being distributed by Turkish Red Crescent in Ras Al-Ayn, Syria, on Saturday.\n\nUnder an agreement made by the US and Turkey on Thursday, a five-day ceasefire has been in place. Turkey expects the Kurdish fighters to pull back from a border area.\n\nA senior Syrian Kurdish official acknowledged for the first time that the Kurdish-led forces agreed to the pull-back, stating that his forces would move 30 kilometres south of the border.\n\nRedur Khalil, a senior Syrian Democratic Forces official, said the withdrawal would take place once Turkey allows the Kurdish-led force to evacuate its fighters and civilians from Ras al-Ayn, a border town under siege by Turkish-backed forces. He said the Kurdish-led force was preparing plans to conduct that evacuation on Sunday, if there were no further delays.\n\nMr Khalil said Kurdish-led fighters would pull back from a 120-kilometre stretch along the border from Ras al-Ayn to Tal Abyad, moving past the international highway.\n\n\"We are only committed to the US version not the Turkish one,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA previous agreement between the US and Turkey over a \"safe zone\" along the Syria-Turkish border floundered over the diverging definitions of the area.\n\nMr Erdogan has said the Kurdish fighters must withdraw from a far larger length of the border from the Euphrates River to the Iraqi border \u2013 more than 440 kilometres \u2013 or else the Turkish offensive will resume on Tuesday.\n\nBut US officials say the agreement pertains to the smaller section between the two towns. Mr Kalin confirmed that is the area affected by the pause in fighting, but said Turkey still wants the larger zone.\n\nTwo days into the ceasefire, the border town of Ras al-Ayn has been the sticking point in moving forward.\n\n\"We hope that as of tonight or tomorrow, they will stick to this agreement and leave the area,\" Mr Kalin said.\n\nThe Kurdish official meanwhile said his force had negotiated with the Americans the details of its pull-back from the border, starting with the Ras al-Ayn evacuation. But he said the evacuation stalled for 48 hours because Turkish- backed forces continued their siege of the town.\n\nA partial evacuation took place Saturday. Medical convoys were let into part of the town still in Kurdish hands, evacuating 30 wounded and four bodies from a hospital. Mr Khalil said the plan to complete the evacuation from Ras al-Ayn was now set for Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkish officials denied violating the ceasefire or impeding the fighters' withdrawal, blaming the continued violence on the Kurds.\n\nIf Kurdish fighters then pull back from the 120-kilometre border area, it is uncertain what the arrangement would be along the rest of the north-eastern border, most of which remains solely in the hands of Kurdish-led fighters.\n\nLast week, Syrian forces began deploying into Kurdish areas, moving only into one location directly on the border, the town of Kobani, and a few positions further south.\n\nMr Khalil said the Syrian government and its ally Russia did not want to deploy more extensively in the area, apparently to avoid frictions with Turkey.\n\n\"We noticed there was no desire [from the Russians and Syria] to have the Syrian military on the dividing line between us and the Turks except in Kobani,\" he said.\n\nThe border town of Kobani also stands between Turkish-controlled Syrian territories to the west and Kurdish-held eastern Syria.\n\nMr Khalil said it was not clear what would happen after his forces' withdrawal and five-day ceasefire ends.\n\n\"The deal essentially is handing Syrian land to a foreign country. This is not good. It is bad for us,\" he said. \"We have nothing to win. The only win is the international sympathy.\"\n\nAAP", "description": "The presence of Syrian troops has complicated Turkey's plan to create a 'safe zone' along the border, where it can resettle Syrian refugees now in Turkey.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.257%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/272d18b10aabf255621b9e2826f29570b18a8931", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
