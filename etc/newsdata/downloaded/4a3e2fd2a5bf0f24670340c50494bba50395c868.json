China has responded with tariffs on $185 billion of U.S. products.\n\nWhile things have recently been quiet on the trade front, talks are expected to resume next week in Washington, when Liu He, China\u2019s top trade negotiator is expected to meet with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightheizer on Thursday and Friday. Trade negotiations are expected to continue into the following week. Kudlow says while the president wants to make a deal, he's not going to agree to a deal just to get something done.\n\n\"President Trump has said he'd like to have a deal, but it has to be a good deal covering all the issues, the IP theft and the forced technology transfer and of course the tariff,\" Kudlow said.\n\nAs for the economy, Kudlow said he sees \u201cno recession in sight\u201d when looking at both the coincident and forward-looking indicators. The jobs report out Friday morning showed the U.S. economy added 136,000 nonfarm jobs in September as the unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent, its lowest in 50 years. Other recent hard economic data, including retail sales, housing and durable goods have also topped expectations.\n\nKudlow noted that the unemployment rate comes from the household survey, which he said is \"frequently a leading indicator of a better economy.\u201d", "description": "U.S.-China trade talks are expected to resume next week", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/03/0/0/kudlow.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
