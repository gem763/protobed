It is understood that the latter expressed its surprise at World Rugby's decision to scrap two fixtures well in advance of their respective kick-offs.\n\nF1 remains hopeful that the worst of the typhoon might miss the Suzuka track, situated 250 miles south west of Tokyo. Meanwhile, the race will not be staged on Monday if the cars are unable to run on Sunday.\n\n'They are doing the utmost they can,' said championship leader Hamilton. 'I am sure they are preparing, are aware that it is coming, and have procedures in place.'\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is being put on par with a category 5 hurricane with 160mph winds expected\n\nSebastian Vettel echoed Hamilton's comments. The four-time world champion said: 'I don't think anybody wants to put lives in danger. There is a forecast, but how many times has a forecast changed?\n\n'We will see what happens as the weekend goes on. It makes sense that when we have more evidence tomorrow night to put together a proposal or an action for qualifying then.'\n\nA statement from the FIA read: 'Every effort is being made to minimise disruption to the Formula One timetable.\n\n'However the safety of the fans, competitors and everyone at the Suzuka Circuit remains the top priority. All parties will continue to monitor the situation and provide further updates in due course.'\n\nFour-time world champion Sebastian Vettel echoed Hamilton's comments on Thursday\n\nThe race in Japan has been hit by bad weather in the past, with qualifying staged on Sunday morning on two occasions, in 2004 and 2010. Four years ago, qualifying for the US Grand Prix was pushed back a day due to heavy rain.\n\n'I am happy for them to do that,' added Hamilton, who holds a 73-point championship lead over Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas with 130 available.\n\n'It is cool when the format changes. You have to enter into two different mindsets, and two different rhythms. It is a different challenge so I like that.\n\n'It is intense here when it rains, but I love driving in the wet. It doesn't make a difference to me. It is quite exciting.'", "description": "Lewis Hamilton has backed Formula One's decision to delay whether it will make changes to this weekend's storm-threatened Japanese Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Philip Duncan", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19533750-0-image-a-35_1570703068787.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
