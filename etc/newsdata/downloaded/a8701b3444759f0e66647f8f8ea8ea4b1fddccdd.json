Trump doesn\u2019t want to be president anymore.", "language": "en", "text": "What if the president wants out? There\u2019s much about the job he never liked, which is one reason he spends so much time watching TV rather than actually doing it. Under normal circumstances, it involves any number of things he once avoided; shaking hands with germy people, being talked at by experts who know more than he, sitting still for extended periods, being criticized no matter what he does, empathizing \u2014 all important parts of the job. He has gone to considerable lengths to reshape the role, fired the experts, cleared his schedule, kept up his golf game \u2026 but still. The campaigning was fun, but the best evidence of how little he likes presiding is how seldom he\u2019s actually done it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI got a glimpse of this before he even reported for duty. It was a few weeks after the 2016 election, and I interviewed him in his Trump Tower aerie. He was jovial, gracious, answered all the questions, was reveling in his impending power. As we were finishing, I asked if I could come back later and see him in the White House, to see how it was going. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d he said. But then he paused and asked, \u201cBut \u2026 what if I don\u2019t like it? What if I don\u2019t want to do it anymore?\u201d Sometimes half-joking questions are the most serious.\n\nHe has claimed so often to love being president that it\u2019s easy to think he protests too much. And he\u2019d hardly be the first to be restless: Harry S. Truman called the White House the \u201cgreat white jail.\u201d Bill Clinton dubbed it \u201cthe crown jewel of the federal penal system.\u201d Most presidents endure the serial stresses of hard decisions, the weight of making life-and-death choices, all the teetering values and visions that leadership entails. They live with the fallout, find solace where they can, including in commiseration with their predecessors.\n\nTrump escapes the frustration of failing to accomplish his agenda by not having ever had one, beyond his continued exaltation. He could count this moment as a high point: record-low unemployment, still soaring stock markets, judicial transformation. It\u2019s easy to imagine it\u2019s all downhill \u2014 and fast \u2014 from here. His confidence in his supreme wisdom leads him to make even reckless decisions, such as his abandonment of America\u2019s trust with its Kurdish partners, with no evidence of regret or remorse other than disliking the criticism for doing it. But ever since the Ukraine scandal erupted, his rage-tweeting and Wagnerian self-pity suggest that the incoming fire for his misconduct, occasionally even from his defenders and enablers, has made these days even less fun than usual.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll of which raises the question: the release of the Ukraine information, the double-dare-you defiance of congressional oversight, the sellout in Syria, even the rising profanity of his Twitter stream each seem expertly suited to inflaming one constituency or another, and not just the people who have loathed him from Day One. The polls are moving for a reason: Republicans and independents, even those serving in Congress, may not agree where the line is, but they know there\u2019s one somewhere, and it does not involve a shooting on Fifth Avenue.\n\nConsciously or not, might he conclude that impeachment and removal is his least bad option for escaping the \u201cgreat white jail\u201d? Resigning is out; that\u2019s for quitters. Defeat in 2020 is worse; losing is for losers. But being impeached and removed from office is the one outcome that preserves at least some ability to denounce the deep state and the quislings in the Senate who stabbed him in the back, maintain his bond with his tribe, depart the capital and launch a media business to compete with the ever more flaccid Fox News. (This all presumes that President Pence pardons him, for which there\u2019s some precedent.) Impeachment lets him go down fighting, and he will call it rigged and unfair and illegitimate and a coup, all of which would be harder if the verdict was rendered next November by millions of voters.\n\nSo what would count as a sign of his escape velocity? Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump decamping for Manhattan. Trump issuing an executive order renaming Reagan National Airport after himself. He fires Elaine Chao and starts campaigning against Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. He kicks a puppy on the South Lawn, in front of the cameras.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen you think about it, with a choice of bad options, impeachment doesn\u2019t look so bad, and gets you home to your gilded tower sooner. Assuming, that is, that you don\u2019t think you can just burn the Constitution to the ground and be the last one standing.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "If so, impeachment might be the perfect exit.", "authors": ["Nancy Gibbs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3liMpblWFwfnUokYV1FzvQp3ZVg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JAC5Z6XLVEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
