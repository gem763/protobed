Can everyone please reply \u201cRest In Peace Crazy Frog\u201d. Rest In Peace Crazy Frog.\u2019\n\n\u2018Okay, was anyone going to tell me that crazy frog died, or was I just supposed to read that in the crazy frog wiki page myself,\u2019 one more heartbroken fan asked.\n\nHorrified fans took to social media (Pictures: Twitter)\n\nHowever, it could just be that the star is taking a break from social media as his YouTube channel still boasts regular uploads, the most recent being back in September.\n\nIn fact, the channel appears to be thriving 14 years on from Axel F, and 22 years on from Crazy Frog\u2019s creation, with a following of 6.9 million.\n\nThe most recent video, titled \u2018Pinocchio\u2019, sees the star running through a house of horrors, before being shot out of a cannon in a 33-second whirlwind.\n\nMeanwhile, in the comments, fans have been calling for him to make a full comeback.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou never know, guys.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
