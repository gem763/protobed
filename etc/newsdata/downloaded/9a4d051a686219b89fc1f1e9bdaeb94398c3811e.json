The firm, listed on both the Toronto and New York stock exchanges, brought in US$746.4 million in revenue in 2018. About half its 4,000-plus employees are based in Canada, with the rest in the U.S., Europe, Australia and a sizeable development team in Mauritius. Ossip, a South Africa-born Canadian, became CEO after selling his startup Dayforce to Ceridian in 2012 in what he called a reverse takeover.\n\nThe company isn\u2019t entirely new to the public sector. \u201cWe have played in government,\u201d said Ossip. The firm\u2019s existing clients include the city governments of Pittsburgh, Columbus and Halton Hills, Ont., as well as Elections Canada and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. But the bid to replace Phoenix \u201creally is the first federal project (and) it\u2019s of a different scale.\u201d\n\nScott Berg, managing director of equity research for enterprise and application software at Needham & Company, said the public sector has big potential for the firm. \u201cThe size of the (public-sector) opportunity is massive, relative to Ceridian\u2019s revenues today,\u201d he told The Logic.\n\nCeridian hired Gianluca Cairo, previously chief of staff to Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains and then-procurement minister Judy Foote, to lead the new public-sector vertical. Federal conflict-of-interest commissioner Mario Dion cleared the appointment. Cairo became one of several executive hires with sector expertise brought in to oversee divisions dedicated to major industries like financial services, retail, health care and manufacturing.\n\nOssip said he expects the public-sector vertical to start winning clients rapidly, just like the others have. \u201cNormally, we get traction relatively quickly,\u201d he said, noting that the company has signed customers like American Express and BlackRock in financial services, Kraft Heinz and Colgate in manufacturing and Trader Joe\u2019s in retail. (Those accounts predated the recent executive appointments.)\n\nOn the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call this year, Ossip cautioned that the company doesn\u2019t expect the new public-sector division \u201cto be material for a number of years.\u201d Ceridian went public on the Toronto and New York Stock exchanges in April 2018, and had a market cap of just over $9 billion as of Friday.\n\nBerg said \u201cCeridian stacks up fairly favourably\u201d against its rivals for Phoenix, noting that the firm\u2019s payroll software, workforce management and talent management products are all at least as good as competitors. Its only disadvantage is that unlike its competitors, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a customer that large,\u201d he said. For example, Workday\u2019s software is used by Walmart, which has over two million employees. But Berg said Ceridian won\u2019t have the same problem with state- or province-sized clients.\n\nOssip noted that individual departments within the Canadian federal government are not much different in size than its existing public-sector users, and that municipalities tend to have more complex contracts like those for police and emergency services.\n\nHe\u2019s confident that Ceridian can compete against the larger firms. \u201cWe are regarded in industry as the best when it comes to payroll complexity,\u201d and other factors including time calculations and scheduling, he said, noting that \u201cthe number-one challenge of the government is to pay people accurately.\u201d\n\nThe company doesn\u2019t have to customize its payroll software for each new government client, because it\u2019s built around a \u201crules engine\u201d that continuously calculates pay based on time and employment terms. By contrast, Phoenix contractor IBM said the federal government asked it to make more than 1,500 changes to the software on which the system is based.\n\nCeridian plans to pursue public-sector clients in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia and Ireland \u2014 all the markets in which it currently offers its payroll system \u2014 as well as New Zealand, where it launches in 2020. \u201cAlso, in all those countries, there are a number of provinces and states that all typically have similar types of problems and challenges that you see at (the Canadian federal government),\u201d Ossip said.\n\nThe company is also looking to go global, with ambitions to launch its flagship payroll system into more than a dozen new markets. \u201cOur plan is to be in about 20 different countries natively, within, say, three years,\u201d said Ossip.\n\nThe company\u2019s current business is heavily focused on North America; in 2018, it made 99.6 per cent of its revenue in the U.S. and Canada. It began to push beyond the two countries in July 2018, when it launched its payroll system in the U.K. The company has since rolled out the product in Australia, in April, and Ireland, in September.\n\nIn September, Ceridian bought Riteq, an Australian workforce management software company, after seeing early traction for its own such software with clients like telecommunications giant Optus and the jewelry retailer Michael Hill.\n\nCeridian will add about 100 employees through the Riteq deal, giving it a larger regional workforce as it enters New Zealand. \u201cOnce we have that going, we\u2019ll move to (Asia-Pacific) next, which is somewhat related, much like the U.S. and Canada,\u201d he said, declining to specify which countries it\u2019s targeting next, but adding via email that the company is still \u201cexploring potential expansion areas.\u201d\n\nOn Ceridian\u2019s 2019 first-quarter conference call, Ossip also cited \u201cexpansion possibilities in Asia\u201d and named Germany and South Africa specifically, while emphasizing no decisions had been made. The company already has customers using its workforce management software in 50 markets. It\u2019s also translated the platform into 20 languages, including Chinese, Hindi, Thai, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nOssip said Ceridian will continue its acquisition strategy in new markets. \u201cThere are many companies that, I would argue, have 20- to 30-year-old technology, that are somewhat stalled because they can\u2019t continue to deliver value,\u201d he said. \u201cThose companies for us are very attractive\u2026. We need access to their people, their customers and their partners.\u201d\n\nTraining new people on payroll rules and systems can take up to two years, Ossip said, but staff at existing local HR software firms already understand workforce management.\n\nOssip also uses acquisitions to gain expertise on local regulations, as he did with the Ceridian-Dayforce deal to understand U.S. tax rules. \u201cIn the U.S. you\u2019ve got about 10,000 tax jurisdictions, and each of them have many different taxes,\u201d he said, noting that it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to build that part of the system \u201cin, say, under 10 years.\u201d The deal also brought in a large amount of client data on which the company could test its product to ensure it was paying people the right amounts on time.\n\nOssip said it now costs Ceridian between $1 million and $2 million to do the necessary research and development and localization to offer Dayforce in a new country. The company can then sign up more clients using the acquired companies\u2019 staff and partner network. \u201cWe enter the market not trying to sell two or three customers per year, (but) 50 to 100 customers in the first year,\u201d he said.\n\nBerg is \u201cvery favourable\u201d on the acquisition strategy. \u201cYou can accelerate those local efforts much more quickly, because those local people have that knowledge,\u201d he said, adding that Ceridian has the resources to make more of such deals. The company reported cash and equivalents worth US$237.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2019.\n\nBerg said Ceridian\u2019s immediate international opportunity is \u201csupporting their North American customers that have employees in (expansion) countries,\u201d noting that it will take a couple of years before new markets are big revenue contributors.\n\nBut he also sees limits to Ceridian\u2019s international prospects for payroll. European countries have sufficiently different payroll regulations that multinationals tend to use local software in each one, and there aren\u2019t many with both large populations and a big U.S. corporate presence. Ceridian could enter Germany and France, but \u201cafter that, I think the road\u2019s really limited.\u201d\n\nAs for Asia, \u201cI have a difficult time seeing anything outside of an extension into Japan,\u201d Berg said, noting that payroll in China is extremely complex and that no providers have successfully entered the Indian market.\n\nCeridian\u2019s moves are bringing it in even closer competition with some big rivals, but Ossip isn\u2019t concerned. \u201cWe understand pay, I think, better than anyone else,\u201d he said, noting that, by its own estimates, the company pays one in five private-sector workers in Canada. The company will be hoping to be able to say the same for the public sector and other markets soon.\n\nThe Logic", "description": "CEO explains how he sees Ceridian competing against giants of the field, and why acquisitions are key to its plans for international expansion", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ceridian.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
