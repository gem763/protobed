In fact he\u2019s Finchy from The Office", "language": "en", "text": "The only real question left to answer about Dominic Cummings, the former strategic genius whom you would now no longer trust to light one of his own farts without hospitalising himself, is whether he is Finchy to Johnson\u2019s David Brent or the other way around.\n\nAfter watching the full six minutes of his perambulatory WTFgasm with Sky News\u2019s Lewis Goodall, it is hard to decide which of The Office\u2019s most iconic scenes it most closely represents.\n\nGoodall, in hot pursuit of Cummings through the dark in the London rain on Thursday night, wants to know what everyone wants to know. If, by the end of next month\u2019s EU Summit, the UK and the EU haven\u2019t done a deal, will Boris Johnson do what he is legally compelled to do, and ask for an Article 50 extension?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHe asks this several times, but frankly, has not considered the sheer genius of the man before him, who, instead of an answer, instead starts to quiz Mr Goodall on the date of the EU summit in question, and what date does Johnson have to have written the letter by. \u201cIs it the 17th or the 18th?\u201d Cummings shouts, several times, pointing in Goodall\u2019s direction.\n\nGoodall, off the top of his head, can\u2019t remember if it\u2019s the 17th or the 18th or the 19th because, well, because it very obviously does not matter in the slightest.\n\nAnd this, we quickly learn, is how Cummings, in his own small head and absolutely nowhere else, imagines himself to have emerged victorious from a baffling and downright weird encounter.\n\nBut back to the original question. Because I\u2019ve watched it six times now and I really cannot decide, in that moment, whether we are seeing David Brent, shouting, \u201cThere\u2019s a been a rape up there!\u201d in the face of a confused corporate teambuilding facilitator\n\nOr are we witnessing Finchy, throwing a pair of shoes over the office building and thus claiming victory in the staff pub quiz that everyone has just seen him hopelessly lose?\n\nWho am I kidding? Course it\u2019s Finchy. It\u2019s so obvious. Just as Tim is told, at this point, as the winners champagne is ripped free from his hand, \u201cDon\u2019t f*** with the big boys\u201d, so Cummings goes on a similarly enlightened charm offensive.\n\n\u201cPeople watching at home should know, don\u2019t watch the news, it\u2019s almost all bulls***,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThey have people like you on and they don\u2019t even know it\u2019s the 17th or the 18th of October. That\u2019s your job to know that. You don\u2019t know that do you?\u201d\n\nI confess, even I did not suspect Cummings was this bad. Whoever could have known that a man who locks himself in a cupboard to be alone with his thoughts is in fact the kind of genius who fires out devastating \u201cactually it\u2019s *you\u2019re* not your\u201d style take downs to blue tick celebrities on Twitter?\n\nStill, it is possible the great man actually has a point. Anyone who has watched any of the news over the last 24 hours would struggle not to agree with the idea that the news is all bulls***. And this, principally, is because it has mainly featured bulls***, being talked by Dominic Cummings.\n\nOn Thursday night, he made a rare televised public appearance at a book launch for a hard Brexit backing multimillionaire donor, and breezily announced that Brexit \u201cis a walk in the park\u201d.\n\nOn Friday morning, the same news reporters asked him, \u201cIs it all a walk in the park?\u201d\n\nOnly for him to reply, \u201cA walk in the park, who said that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d he was told. \u201cYou said it at a book launch last night.\u201d\n\nAt this point he is in his government car, shouting, \u201cNooooo,\u201d just as the door shuts, when the word he is looking for is in fact, \u201cYeeeees.\u201d\n\nAll of this has left us precious little time to get in to the fact that he is still nonchalantly blaming MPs for their own death threats, for \u201cnot getting Brexit done,\u201d still has \u201csenior cabinet ministers\u201d anonymously briefing The Times, to warn that if you don\u2019t get Brexit done \u201cthere will be riots\u201d.\n\nIt is miserable to have to point out that, in public life, the role of the people who make the laws has traditionally been to encourage people not to break them. Governments, traditionally, tell people not to riot, rather than to threaten the country with them.\n\nStill, Classic Dom and all that, as they say, whose final words to Mr Goodall were arguably the best. \u201cYou\u2019re not a very good journalist mate,\u201d he says.\n\nTo which we can only ask, of the man who has thrown Ken Clarke out of the Tory party, failed to get a general election, lost every single vote in the House of Commons and has been internationally and unanimously humiliated by all eleven judges of the Supreme Court, how good do you think you are, exactly, at this political strategy stuff?\n\nAt some point, inevitably, there will be an election, and the public will have to make their minds up. Eventually, Brent liberates himself from his false idolisation of his idiot hero. The last we ever see of Finchy is the back of him, on his way into the Christmas party, and three telling words:\n\n\u201cChris, f*** off.\u201d\n\nIt may just be that the voters come to a similar conclusion.", "description": "The only real question left to answer about Dominic Cummings, the former strategic genius whom you would now no longer trust to light one of his own farts without hospitalising himself, is whether he is Finchy to Johnson\u2019s David Brent or the other way around.
