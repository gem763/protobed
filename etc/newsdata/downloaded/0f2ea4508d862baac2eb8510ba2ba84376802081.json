As part of that, it committed to making telecommunications consume safeguard one of its top priorities.\n\nAs a reflection of that, the ACMA issued just over 4,100 informal warnings and 165 formal warnings, which included 45 in relation to telco consumer safeguards.\n\nAdditionally, 15 infringement notices were issued, with telco consumer safeguards accounting for eight of those.\n\n\"This strategic approach provides transparency to industry on where the ACMA will be placing its compliance efforts in a consistent and coordinated manner,\" the ACMA chair Nerida O'Loughlin said.\n\nWhen it came to the National Broadband Network (NBN) consumer experience safeguards, the ACMA carried out 50 investigations that resulted in 42 breaches, with 35 in relation to handling standards and another seven for information standards.\n\n\"Of the 50 investigations completed, 49 were finalised within the benchmark time frame of six months. The delay in one investigation was caused by the complexity of the matter, the high number of potential breaches to be assessed and the volume of evidence to review,\" the report stated.\n\nThe ACMA also revealed that it collected AU$691 million in revenue on behalf of the government in 2018-19.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "The ACMA 2018-19 annual report said it was due to the enforcement of criminal law.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/03/12/27381a01-bda4-4602-9356-5816d1cc500a/thumbnail/770x578/0594143618a246adfff0aa20acac19cc/afp-asst-commissioner-backs-metadata-collection.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
