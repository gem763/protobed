Do any current or former disgruntled national security aides with a reputation for score-settling in the press present themselves as logical suspects?\n\nThe post-Bolton era will be a golden age of natsec leaking, my friends.\n\nPresident Donald Trump discussed easing sanctions on Iran to help secure a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani later this month, prompting then-National Security Advisor John Bolton to argue forcefully against such a step, according to three people familiar with the matter. After an Oval Office meeting on Monday when the idea came up, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin voiced his support for the move as a way to restart negotiations with Iran, some of the people said. Later in the day, Trump decided to oust Bolton, whose departure was announced Tuesday. The White House has started preparations for Trump to meet with Rouhani this month in New York on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly the week of Sept. 23, according to the people. It\u2019s far from clear if the Iranians would agree to talks while tough American sanctions remain in place\u2026 Easing any sanctions without major concessions from Iran would undercut the pressure campaign that not only Bolton, but also Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Trump have said is the only effective way to make Iran change its behavior.\n\nMacron has discussed brokering a meeting between Trump and a top Iranian diplomat. He might end up as the conduit at the UN.\n\nNeedless to say, backing off sanctions on Iran would mean abandoning the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d approach Trump has taken towards the country since exiting Obama\u2019s nuclear deal. The two sides are playing a game of chicken right now: Trump has ramped up sanctions in hopes of bringing the Iranian economy to its knees (with some success, by the way), believing that they\u2019ll cave and agree to nuclear terms more favorable to American in exchange for sanctions relief. Iran is ramping up its enrichment program again in hopes of making Trump panic about a new crisis in the Middle East, believing that he\u2019ll cave and start lifting sanctions as a precondition to getting them back to the bargaining table. Iran\u2019s president has explicitly said, in fact, that they won\u2019t talk to the United States in a meaningful way unless Trump blinks first. Who\u2019s the chicken?\n\nIf you believe this Bloomberg story, it sounds like Trump\u2019s the chicken. Or will be soon.\n\nA basic problem for him in trying to stare down Iran is that he keeps signaling how reluctant he is to let this cold war turn hot. Skepticism of war is his most laudable quality as president but he\u2019s made such a show of it that it\u2019s ended up undercutting the effectiveness of his \u201cmadman\u201d image. Ideally Iran would be eager to talk with Trump without preconditions because they\u2019ve concluded that he\u2019s so wacky and bellicose that he just might order a bombing run on Tehran after all. And he is wacky in many things. But in matters of war he\u2019s arguably more sober than his advisors, to the point of boasting that he canceled an attack on Iran because he cares about Iranian lives just that much. Iran is sizing him up; they knows there\u2019s a presidential election coming; they know how eager Trump is to keep his campaign promise of avoiding new military entanglements; they know from his experience with North Korea (and more recently the Taliban) how enchanted he is by big peacemaker photo ops, even if they don\u2019t produce anything meaningful for the United States. And so they\u2019ve concluded that it\u2019s safe to drive a hard bargain with the \u201cmadman\u201d after all. His carrot-and-stick approach is really all carrot.\n\nI mean, he sent Rand Paul to feel them out on talks, for fark\u2019s sake. How much plainer can he be that he\u2019s desperate for diplomacy?\n\nThey probably figure they can get him to recommit to the basic framework of the Obama nuclear deal so long as they add a few token bells and whistles and be sure to credit him lavishly with an unprecedented master stroke of diplomacy. But they\u2019re going to test him first by refusing to agree to talks unless and until he blinks on sanctions. And now we find out that he\u2019s thinking about blinking.\n\nThis Times piece from a few weeks ago about Iran coming around to the idea of talks with Trump caught my eye because it\u2019s not what you\u2019d expect in the current political climate. Trump\u2019s polling has slipped lately. The trade war is deepening. He\u2019s no better than a 50/50 shot at reelection. You might think that Iran would try to wait him out for 14 more months and see if they end up with a Democrat in 2021 who\u2019s willing to reinstate the Obama nuclear deal. But no:\n\nThe new strategy, those who spoke about it said, was also predicated on dangling a foreign-policy victory to Mr. Trump that he could use to bolster his re-election prospects\u2026 If Mr. Trump wanted a \u201cmore comprehensive\u201d deal than the existing accord, then Iran would consider his demand \u2014 and even discuss parts of its ballistic missile program and Iran\u2019s role in the region \u2014 but in return Iran, too, would seek a more comprehensive guarantee from the United States for long-lasting economic relief, the people at the meeting said. \u201cThis golden window of opportunity will likely not repeat in the next decade,\u201d Sadegh Alhusseini, a senior foreign-policy and economic adviser to Mr. Jahangiri, said in a Twitter message. \u201cThis is the start of the game for Iran. Approaching U.S. elections give Iran a rare card to play with Trump.\u201d\n\nIran might actually prefer a dovish Republican in office to a Democrat. Most of the hawkish impulse towards the country within the U.S. comes from the right, after all. With a Democrat in charge, those right-wing hawks are free to agitate for war, or at least \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d in the form of sanctions. With Trump in office, they can\u2019t. It\u2019d be \u201cdisloyal\u201d to the president to do so. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s party now, not John Bolton\u2019s. So for Iran, friendly relations with Trump is basically a risk-free gamble. If they hand him a diplomatic win and he\u2019s reelected, he\u2019ll owe them in his second term and will be eager to build on the fledgling detente. If they hand him a diplomatic win and he loses, his Democratic successor will be reluctant to toss Iran\u2019s olive branch to Trump aside and resume a hostile posture. It\u2019s Democrats even more so than Republicans who want better relations with Iran, after all.\n\nSo what do they lose by talking to him and just maybe nailing down a grand bargain in which America formally recognizes the regime and renounces future efforts at regime change? For cripes sake, he was willing to legitimize the Taliban with a U.S. visit without even demanding they commit to a ceasefire. He\u2019ll have Rouhani over for a state dinner before 2020 is out. No doubt they think they can roll him, especially with Bolton now out of the picture. But just to be sure, they\u2019re going to test him to see if he\u2019s willing to blink on sanctions first. He probably will.", "description": "Weakness.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/b-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
