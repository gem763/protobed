We are both deeply disappointed by this decision today.'\n\nMs DeSouza also added that her case would have implications for EU citizens post-Brexit.\n\nThe Co Derry woman insisted the Home Office position ran contrary to the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which gave anyone from Northern Ireland the right to identify as British, Irish or both.\n\nGovernment lawyers argued the British Nationality Act 1981 was the relevant legislation - not the Good Friday accord.\n\nIt said the Act ruled that anyone born in Northern Ireland was automatically British, until such time as they renounce that citizenship.\n\nShe said the UK government had failed to implement the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement into UK domestic law.", "description": "The Home Office has won its appeal against an immigration tribunal ruling that found people born in Northern Ireland are automatically British, Emma DeSouza.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/12/19690004-0-image-a-20_1571052635044.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
