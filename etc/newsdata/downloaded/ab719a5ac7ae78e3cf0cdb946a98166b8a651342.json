(Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)\n\nEven a 17-0 lead over Notre Dame couldn\u2019t stop Michigan fans from being furious about a pass interference call.\n\nTo be fair, it was a really bad call.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn the third quarter, Notre Dame quarterback Ian Book took a shot to tight end Cole Kmet, who was being covered by two Michigan defenders. The pass was intercepted by Brad Hawkins, only to be taken off the board by a pass interference call on Khaleke Hudson.\n\nHudson had one hand on Kmet\u2019s chest, but it was rather insignificant contact. You be the judge.\n\nMichigan's Brad Hawkins intercepts a pass from Notre Dame QB Ian Book. (via ABC)\n\nMichigan Stadium erupted with fury, and fans got even more mad when the Irish scored a touchdown a few plays later. This time, Book found Kmet wide open in the end zone, cutting Michigan\u2019s lead to 17-7.\n\nKmet was promptly pelted by a siege of complimentary towels that were given out to the fans in attendance.

(via ABC)\n\nWe usually don\u2019t condone throwing things on the field, but that\u2019s a pretty good throw.\n\nBy the way, Notre Dame\u2019s defense was hit with two pass interference penalties on the subsequent drive \u2014 including one that was pretty questionable. And it didn\u2019t get better after that as the Wolverines ran away with a 45-14 win.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Notre Dame tight end Cole Kmet was pelted with towels.", "authors": ["Sam Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8dUQfS7QqlrGyhg.OlN9VQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RaTMwE9EnBlGMkF60FUXyQ--~B/aD0yNTc3O3c9Mzg2NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8eca9220-f860-11e9-afff-8dc04489ad3c", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
