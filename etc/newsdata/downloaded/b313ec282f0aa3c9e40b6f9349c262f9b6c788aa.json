All will be sold with no reserve price.\n\nIn February Swiss prosecutors said they were dropping charges of financial wrongdoing against Teodorin Obiang Nguema but were confiscating the luxury cars as part of the case.\n\nUnder the Swiss penal code, prosecutors can choose to drop charges in this category if defendants offer compensation \u201cand restore a situation that is in conformity with the law\u201d.\n\nYoung Africa: new wave of politicians challenges old guard Read more\n\nEquatorial Guinea has also agreed to give Geneva 1.3m Swiss francs to cover the costs of the case.\n\nVice president with responsibility for defence and security, Teodorin Obiang has a reputation for a playboy lifestyle.\n\nIn October 2017 a Paris court handed Obiang a three-year suspended jail term after convicting him of siphoning off public money to buy assets in France.\n\nHe was accused of spending more than 1,000 times his official annual salary on a six-storey mansion in a posh part of the French capital, a fleet of fast cars and artworks, among other assets.\n\nHe was also given a suspended fine of 30m euros.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Teodorin Nguema Obiang.

Last October, he was promoted from colonel directly to division general, without passing through the normal intermediary rank of brigade general. The following month, he presided over a cabinet meeting for the first time.\n\nThe tiny West African nation is one of the continent\u2019s top petroleum producers and has a population of just 1.2 million. The country is regularly cited by NGOs as one of the most corrupt in the world.", "description": "Luxury cars seized from vice president Teodorin Obiang Nguema are expected to fetch $18m at Geneva auction", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ea56f93bd5a87cac4d89fd679af0f02ecf7acc/309_291_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=242de60533fd6261146d3b69822394a2", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
