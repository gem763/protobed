It is done all the time,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile Ukraine\u2019s new prosecutor general announced on Friday that he is reviewing cases involving the Burisma gas company where Hunter Biden sat on the board.\n\nRuslan Ryaboshapka, Ukraine's prosecutor general, speaking in Kiev on Friday Credit: REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko More\n\nRuslan Ryaboshapka told journalists in Kiev that his office was conducting an audit of previous investigations by the prosecutor general, including cases against Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma.\n\n\u201cWe are now looking again at all cases that were closed or broken up or were investigated earlier to make a decision to reconsider those instances where illegal procedural decisions were made,\u201d Mr Ryaboshapka.", "description": "Explosive texts messages have revealed the lengths US diplomats went to get Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden this summer, weakening Donald Trump\u2019s key rebuttal to the scandal.", "authors": ["Ben Riley-Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TmDNECvCNHNutD_vJrFFsQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/c4fb20b8ef809920e6fd3455b8510aa8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
