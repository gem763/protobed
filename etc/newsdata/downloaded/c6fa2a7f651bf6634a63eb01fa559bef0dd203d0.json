Korea claims nuclear talks 'broke down'", "language": "en", "text": "The much-anticipated restart of stalled nuclear negotiations with North Korea got off to a rocky start Saturday, with Pyongyang saying talks had collapsed within hours, while U.S. officials claimed there were \u201cgood discussions\u201d and expressed hope for another round later this month.\n\nThe State Department quickly pushed back Saturday evening at a North Korean statement that the working-level talks in Sweden \u201cbroke down\u201d because the American delegation had shown up \u201cempty-handed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe early comments from the DPRK delegation do not reflect the content or the spirit of today\u2019s eight-and-a-half hour discussion,\u201d the State Department said in a statement. \u201cThe U.S. brought creative ideas and had good discussions with its DPRK counterparts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. delegation previewed a number of new initiatives,\u201d the statement said, asserting that the goal was to \u201cmake progress\u201d on the basic agreement reached in Singapore last year between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to pursue denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s statement came after North Korean nuclear negotiator Kim Myong-gil had offered an entirely different take during an appearance Saturday in front of the North Korean Embassy on the outskirts of Stockholm after holding talks with his American counterpart, U.S. Special Envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun.\n\n\u201cThe negotiation did not live up to our expectations and broke down. I am very displeased,\u201d Mr. Kim said, according to a report on his comments by South Korea\u2019s Yonhap News Agency. \u201cIt is entirely because the U.S. has not discarded its old stance and attitude that the negotiation this time failed to produce any results.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s talks in Sweden marked the first time the two sides have engaged in in-depth working-level talks since negotiations broke down in February during at a second summit that Mr. Trump had with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\nThe Hanoi talks collapsed over Mr. Kim\u2019s demand that the U.S. deliver sweeping sanctions relief in exchange for only a partial dismantling of his nuclear arsenal. The North Korean leader\u2019s posture at the time was widely seen to be a response to an apparent all-or-nothing offer put forward by the American side in Hanoi.\n\nAnalysts have said the U.S. officers were likely to embrace more of a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach at this weekend\u2019s working-level talks in Sweden and see what the North Korean side brought to the table in response.\n\nBut the North\u2019s negotiator Kim Myong-gil claimed Saturday that the talks \u201cdid not live up to [Pyongyang\u2019s] expectations and broke down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very displeased,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is entirely because the U.S. has not discarded its old stance and attitude that the negotiation this time failed to produce any results.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials were frustrated by the remark.\n\n\u201cThe United States and the [North Korea] will not overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula through the course of a single Saturday,\u201d the State Department said in its statement. \u201cThese are weighty issues, and they require a strong commitment by both countries. The United States has that commitment.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the U.S. side had indicated at the end of Saturday\u2019s talks that it seeks to hold another round in Stockholm in two weeks.\n\nIt was not clear Saturday night whether the North Korean side plans to show up.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
