I predicted it. This is why I have cue cards because I was watching Reese Witherspoon doing her speech \u2013 I am completely off speech right now \u2013 why can\u2019t it be the one that\u2019s right in front of you?\n\n\u2018Oh Lord, well I will just get into it and trust these prompters will work.\u2019\n\nOnly it wasn\u2019t Reese giving the speech but Jennifer, her fellow honoree.\n\nEasy mistake, Mariah.\n\nThe superstar was honoured for her work with the Fresh Air Fund\u2019s Camp Maria, which she started 25 years ago and to which she showed off her trademark humour, adding: \u2018If you don\u2019t see what an accomplishment that was for a two-year-old child.\u2019\n\nThe superstar was honoured for her work with the Fresh Air Fund\u2019s Camp Maria (Picture: Variety)\n\n\u2018I was 18 years old when I got my first record deal.
