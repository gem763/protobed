I did not have anything against Ramaphosa, I just had a preference and that preference was Dlamini-Zuma,\u201d said Magashule.\n\nThe charismatic Magashule was engaging the youth league and community members at a packed Suurman Community Hall in Hammanskraal.\n\nHe spoke about the impediments that the governing party was experiencing in trying to implement ANC resolutions.\n\nHe said ANC leaders in particular needed to stop being out of touch with communities and be accessible to them even after election seasons.\n\n\u201cWhy are people not voting for the ANC today as much they have been in days gone by? Could it be because of our leaders who now only become available when it\u2019s election season?\u201d asked Magashule.\n\nHe said instead of making communities their priority, leaders were enriching themselves in communities, under the guise of having good intentions.\n\n\u201cWe have leaders who hand out money, significant amounts, and not truly empower communities for the mere reason of making them dependent on them so that they these communities will feel indebted to them to levels where they even tolerate corruption and shady dealings that they partake in,\u201d said Magashule.\n\nIn what could be interpreted as a swipe at Ramaphosa, whose campaign leading up to the ANC last elective conference has been tainted by allegations of being bolstered by exorbitant cash donations, Magashule: \u201cMoney will never buy the ANC comrades, let me tell you. One\u2019s convictions and love for the ANC will at the end ensure their standing within the party.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to City Press, ANC caucus spokesperson and Youth League Tshwane regional chairperson Lesego Makhubela explained that the Youth League had invited Magashule in his capacity as the party\u2019s secretary-general and custodian of the party\u2019s resolutions.\n\n\u201cAs secretary-general, Magashule is tasked with implementing resolutions taken by the party. We therefore want him to come and address our people who are living under adverse conditions on when resolutions take by the party to better them will be implemented,\u201d said Makhubela.", "description": "A critical ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule yesterday lambasted his party\u2019s leadership, saying principles and values have slowly been eroded and watered down within the governing party, but has pledged to serve loyally under President Cyril Ramaph", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9260/b37786bd9c5a497db6911c21378de3ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
