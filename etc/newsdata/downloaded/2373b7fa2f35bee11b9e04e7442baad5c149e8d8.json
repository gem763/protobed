THE MIDDLE PEDAL.'\n\nThe elderly man (pictured) demands cash to clean his clothes after the two students accidentally splash him in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire in Scotland\n\nThe video starts with Ethan saying: 'I genuinely didn't mean it, I am sorry. I am sorry mate.'\n\nThe older man responds 'Well this is going to cost six or seven quid to get dry cleaned.'\n\nEthan says: 'That's fine, mate, have you got a bank and I will transfer you the money?'\n\nThe man snaps back: 'No, never mind banks. Cash or the police - it's up to yourself.'\n\nEthan opens his wallet and says: 'Right, I've got five there. I am sorry mate, I've got a fiver I'm sorry.'\n\nEthan (pictured holding the fiver) opens his wallet and says: 'Right, I've got five there. I am sorry mate, I've got a fiver I'm sorry'\n\nThe man (pictured holding the cash) then snatches a \u00a35 note from the driver and storms off still muttering to himself\n\nThe man then says: 'Why did you not just slow down? That's what the brakes are for?'\n\nHe then raises his hand and points to Ethan's feet, saying: 'Middle pedal, the middle pedal.'\n\nAs Ethan continues to apologise, the man snatches the \u00a35 note and stomps off, warning: 'Right, on you go, but I'm telling you I am still putting your name in.'\n\nLachlann (pictured) posted the footage to social media the same day, with users reacting to the funny scene\n\nLachlann said: 'We turned a corner which had a massive puddle, almost the size of the road, in which we accidentally soaked the man who we never saw until after we turned the corner.\n\n'We stopped immediately after realising we soaked him, he then came over to the car fuming so I decided to record.'\n\nHe added: 'Looking back he was eventually going to wash his clothes anyway so I don't see why he wanted money, besides, does he not have a washing machine, it wasn't even a suit or anything, he was wearing brown jeans and a jacket.\n\n'The old guy shouldn't have acted the way he did, or took the money, an apology should have been enough in my opinion.'\n\nTwitter users responded with one saying: 'That old chestnut of 'dry cleaners' - he's straight in to buy ale.'\n\nAnother said: 'Bit a water. I thought he crashed at first. Burst out laughing when he said this'll cost about six or seven quid.'\n\nA third person said: 'Hahaha he wasn't leaving without some form of cash for the costly damages lol.'", "description": "Ethan Taylor and his friend Lachlann Ross, both 20, were driving in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire in Scotland, on Saturday morning when they accidentally splashed the pedestrian.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/16/19747956-0-image-a-67_1571154191675.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
