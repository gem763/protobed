His wife wipes something off of his cheek. Folk music plays in the background as the couple piles their children into a minivan and drives off to school, in what could easily be a Dodge Caravan commercial but is actually an ad featuring the man who could become Canada\u2019s next prime minister\u2014Andrew Scheer.\n\nPolitical strategists long thought the 2019 federal election here would be Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s to lose. He took office in 2015 with about as much international star power as a Canadian official can have\u2014the young, smiling, yoga-posing son of a former prime minister who welcomed refugees to Canada and held his own against President Donald Trump. But after a string of domestic scandals and the revelation that the world\u2019s wokest prime minister wore black- and brownface in his past, Liberal reelection is in jeopardy. Despite broad support for many of his government\u2019s policies, Canadians see Trudeau\u2019s personal brand as badly damaged.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNow polling neck-and-neck with Trudeau, through little of his own doing, is Scheer, the leader of the center-right Conservative Party. Which means Trudeau could be unseated by a man who remains mostly unknown outside Canada\u2014an unassuming, 40-year-old father of five who represents Saskatchewan, and whose party has been known to share photos of him swinging a baseball bat with poor form and playing beer pong wearing a suit jacket.\n\nCampaigning in a country that\u2019s broadly alarmed by the politics of its neighbor to the south, Scheer has faced accusations that he might use his power as prime minister to pursue a socially conservative agenda, or to try pleasing the far-right fringes of a party prone to fracturing. But his campaign has tried to focus on Trudeau\u2019s deficiencies and offer a nonthreatening, even banal alternative. Even Scheer\u2019s opponents admit he is a pretty nice guy. He quotes \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d to his staff; he watches football and uses sports metaphors, associates say. Publicly, he likes to talk about his love for popcorn and tries to come across as the kind of person you might run into at a grocery store.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a dad,\u201d says Kenzie Potter, Scheer\u2019s top adviser. \u201cHe makes dad jokes. He has a dad bod. He is the quintessential dad.\u201d\n\nStill, Scheer, who declined to be interviewed for this article, isn\u2019t politically naive. His campaign presents him as Trudeau\u2019s opposite: someone who promises to be fiscally responsible where Trudeau would overspend, who is a staid conservative, rather than a costume-loving showoff, and who, his staff are confident, is consistent enough to avoid the accusations of hypocrisy that have begun to plague the Liberal leader. He also has claimed he would push back more forcefully against Trump.\n\nAnd he surprised many Canadians during the first official debate of the campaign, on Monday night, by confronting Trudeau directly.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau only pretends to stand up for Canada,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s very good at pretending things. He can\u2019t even remember how many times he put blackface on. Because the fact of the matter is he\u2019s always wearing a mask.\u201d Addressing the prime minister a beat later, he added, \u201cYou are a phony, and you are a fraud, and you do not deserve to govern this country.\u201d Scheer maintained a steady tone and even a slight, gentle smile during the attack.\n\nAt the end of the day, Conservative strategists say they hope a fed-up Canadian public will prefer to risk being sort of bored by their federal government, rather than being sort of embarrassed by it.\n\n\n\n***\n\nScheer has made much of his own humble upbringing. His father, Jim, now a Catholic deacon, was a librarian at the Ottawa Citizen newspaper. Scheer\u2019s mother, Mary, who died in 2017, was a nurse. Scheer took a paper route as a kid and learned about the fall of communism from Citizen front pages, sparking an early interest in politics. As a teenager, he rode public transit. (\u201cHe said that he was destined to be a politician because he had to be really good at convincing people. Because imagine trying to get a girl to meet you on the bus for a date,\u201d Potter says.)\n\nAs a politician, too, Scheer has often been the underdog\u2014but managed to win. He seized a federal seat in Saskatchewan in 2004, at the age of 25, beating a longtime incumbent in the provincial capital not long after having moved there to be with his wife, Jill. In 2011, despite some naysaying, he became the youngest House speaker in Canadian history at age 32, assuming a nonpartisan role that includes moderating debates in the House of Commons, but also serving as something of a diplomat representing the Canadian Parliament abroad.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s defeat in 2015, a crowded field of relative unknowns put their names forward to replace him as the Conservative leader, but several more obvious contenders held back. The candidate with the most name recognition, \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary, dropped out late in the game, when it became clear that a reality television candidate would not be a slam-dunk on the Canadian center-right. That helped clear the path for Scheer, who some thought was too young and unknown to run for leadership, but who ultimately secured many key endorsements from members of Parliament.\n\nScheer\u2019s campaign made strategic choices that positioned him for a victory on the ranked ballot. He was trailing Maxime Bernier\u2014a libertarian who had proposed eliminating supply management on dairy, egg and poultry farms\u2014so Scheer courted the powerful dairy lobby and won its support. His voting record in Parliament had been socially conservative enough to ensure support from anti-abortion groups, whose star candidates were sure to drop off the ballot early. And although he styles himself primarily a fiscal conservative, Scheer\u2019s message during the leadership convention was one of unity, something attractive to the \u201cbig blue tent\u201d of Canadian conservatism. (In Canada, the Conservatives sport blue and the Liberals red, a perhaps-unintentional nod to our long-standing attempts to differentiate ourselves from America.)\n\nThe slogging, 1\u00bd-year leadership race culminated in a long, tense evening in May 2017. At a packed convention hall in a Toronto suburb, with Mario and Luigi and a couple of furries loitering outside (the vote was held next-door to an anime convention), party rank and file watched as Bernier\u2019s initial, comfortable lead narrowed. After trailing all night, Scheer surpassed the front-runner on the final, 13th ballot. He won by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nAll along, Scheer\u2019s campaign manager, Hamish Marshall, had been confident in a mathematical \u201cpath to victory,\u201d he repeatedly said at the time. It was better, Marshall had insisted, not to underestimate this guy.\n\n\n\n***\n\nPotter, who has worked with Scheer since 2011, says Scheer has never come across as hellbent on becoming a world leader. But, as she puts it, \u201cEvery kid who laces up a pair of skates dreams of playing in the NHL.\u201d\n\nIn his first two years as leader, Scheer neither showcased any particular star power nor revealed any debilitating political weaknesses. He allowed other Conservative members of Parliament to outshine him on issues such as immigration and finance. In Parliament, he railed against budgetary deficits and the federal carbon tax, sometimes facing accusations of misinforming the public by omitting details about the rollout of the tax.\n\nMore than anything else, Scheer tried to exploit the chinks in Trudeau\u2019s armor, preparing him for his current election battle with the prime minister. Early this year, Scheer demanded Trudeau\u2019s resignation over allegations that he had inappropriately pressured his former attorney general to help the Montreal company SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal prosecution. During the campaign, Scheer has continued to attack Trudeau for the \u201cSNC-Lavalin affair,\u201d as it\u2019s colloquially known, as well as for the blackface scandal.\n\nTo beat Trudeau, Scheer will have to attract undecided centrist voters. Although he is open about his personal devotion to Catholicism, and his private social conservatism was an important factor in his rise to leadership, more recently Scheer has tried\u2014sometimes unsuccessfully\u2014to downplay his social views. He is frequently asked about abortion; he opposes it but has long said he doesn\u2019t legislate accordingly. Still, there remains no legal framework for abortion in Canada, and there are deep, if mostly unfounded, suspicions on the left that a future Conservative Party will be tempted to follow the examples of Georgia or Missouri. And in August, after a Liberal politician dug up a 2005 speech Scheer gave opposing same-sex marriage, which was legalized in Canada that year, Scheer struggled to coherently answer reporters\u2019 questions about how his views have changed and why he, unlike other Canadian politicians, is unwilling to march in a pride parade. Scheer has responded by saying he supports LGBTQ rights in other ways, and that same-sex marriage is settled law in Canada.\n\nJust as prevalent as the fears around a hidden socially conservative agenda are fears of right-wing populism and, in a country that prides itself on multiculturalism, a vein of anti-immigrant sentiment mirroring that in Europe and the United States. Marshall, the man now running Scheer\u2019s federal campaign, built the campaign-based fundraising platform for the far-right media outfit, The Rebel, when it was founded in 2015. He and other Conservatives disowned the platform in 2017, as it faced criticism for sympathetic coverage of white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, but not before the site began publishing blatant Islamophobia. Marshall insists he was not involved on the editorial side.\n\nIn July 2018, under Scheer, a Conservative social media account tweeted an image of what appeared to be a black man walking through a broken border fence. The party pulled the ad, yet there were lingering questions about the intentions behind it. And in the lead-up to the election, the Conservative Party let go of several candidates for Parliament for inappropriate comments they had made in the past (though such snafus have played out across the political spectrum).\n\nConservative staffers, including some who bemoan the impression that social progressives are unwelcome in the party, reject that there has been any intentional attempt to nod to Trump-style racism. And Scheer has repudiated white supremacy. \u201cI find the notion that one\u2019s race, religion, gender or sexual orientation would make anyone in any way superior or inferior to anybody else absolutely repugnant,\u201d he said during an immigration-themed speech earlier this year.\n\nIt helps the Conservatives\u2019 cause that, late last year, Bernier decided to strike out on his own, forming what would become a Canadian equivalent of the immigration-skeptic fringe parties on Europe\u2019s far right, the People\u2019s Party. Now, Conservatives can point to Bernier\u2019s party as a more obvious home for those with anti-immigrant views.\n\nMore recently, Scheer\u2019s own record has emerged as a challenge mid-campaign. His claim to have worked in the private sector as an insurance broker before entering politics was recently complicated by a Globe and Mail report that he was never licensed to do so. According to his campaign, Scheer had been nearing full accreditation before he left that industry, after less than a year. More recently, the Globe and Mail revealed that Scheer is a dual Canadian-American citizen by birth, though he was born and raised in Canada. His campaign says he is in the process of renouncing the U.S. citizenship, but opponents were quick to point out Scheer\u2019s past criticism of a former governor general for holding a dual citizenship. Trudeau\u2019s top adviser, Gerald Butts, lashed out on Twitter, invoking Trump: \u201cMaybe he\u2019s telling the truth that he never voted in the US,\u201d Butts tweeted of Scheer, with a shrug emoji. \u201cBut do you doubt how he\u2019d vote if he did?\u201d\n\nScheer\u2019s image as a run-of-the-mill middle-class father is somewhat complicated by the fact that his young family has benefited from the salary and housing support that came with his positions in the House of Commons, including living in official residences. Some of his personal interests, like fiscal policy, world history and word etymology, are hard to square with the everyman persona, too. During a fire alarm on Parliament Hill a few years ago, Potter remembers overhearing Scheer\u2019s casual small talk with another member of Parliament; they weren\u2019t talking about the weather, but about their favorite Canadian founding fathers.\n\nOn the whole, Conservative Party sources report being confident that no real skeletons\u2014or old blackface photos\u2014are in Scheer\u2019s closet. \u201cI never once was concerned about looking backward, as the prime minister is right now,\u201d said a senior Conservative source who was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\n\n\n***\n\nScheer\u2019s strengths, those around him say, include his decentralized, deliberative decision-making, his willingness to listen to a variety of points of view and his desire to focus on policies that are broadly supported by his base. \u201cHe said from the day he ran for leader,\u201d Potter recounts, \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s put all the issues conservatives agree with on a whiteboard. Let\u2019s put the few on a whiteboard we don\u2019t agree on. Why are we talking about those?\u2019\u201d\n\nUnderpinning his conservatism is a staunch belief in the Canadian Constitution and an admiration for politicians such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. But Scheer has proved, for the most part, a pragmatist. Internal polling and cross-country door-knocking have showed Conservative strategists that Canadians are worried about the cost of living. Affordability is thus the overwhelming theme of the Conservative election campaign, including tax cuts and boutique tax credits, like for putting kids in sports or taking public transit. Budget cuts are also on the table. Scheer proposes to cut back foreign aid, remove business subsidies that constitute \u201ccorporate welfare,\u201d and create a \u201cnational energy corridor\u201d for oil, gas, telecommunications and hydroelectricity.\n\nScheer has criticized budgetary deficits under Trudeau\u2019s leadership, and observers await a costed platform that explains how Scheer himself would arrive at balance. \u201cA lot of his fiscal credibility is going to ride on whether they have a realistic plan to balance the budget,\u201d says Aaron Wudrick, executive director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, which advocates for smaller government.\n\nOn climate change, Conservatives, who want to reestablish Canada as an oil and gas leader, have thin offerings. They would scrap Trudeau\u2019s carbon tax; they maintain a commitment to the Paris climate accord targets from 2015, but they don\u2019t yet have a detailed vision for achieving them. On foreign policy, Scheer wants to amp up support to Ukraine, sanction Iran and recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Trump. Only about 1 in 5 Canadians approve of the American president, several polls have shown. Almost nothing in Canadian politics is as clear-cut as that. Liberals have questioned how cozy a Conservative prime minister would get with Trump. Scheer, meanwhile, has criticized Trudeau for not standing up to Trump enough in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that in the last few hours Donald Trump just ran the table on him and spoon-fed him concession after concession, and he just capitulated and took it all because he had left himself in such a weak position,\u201d Scheer told reporters on his campaign plane last month. But he has said he would ratify the deal as it stands now, rather than reopen negotiations.\n\nIf the 2019 Canadian election ends up being a referendum on a smarmy celebrity prime minister fallen from grace, the Tories could do worse than a pleasant-seeming guy who has been criticized for smiling too much and seeming too milquetoast. \u201cHe is the least alike politician to Justin Trudeau that you can find right now,\u201d said the senior Conservative source. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like politicians. You look for the thing that\u2019s different\u2014fundamentally different. It gives us the absolute best chance to win.\u201d\n\nIf Canadians are embarrassed at how hard the entire world has recently cringed at Trudeau, then those close to Scheer figure he should shine as a man of moral backbone. \u201cIf he gets sent to a G-7 meeting, nobody\u2019s going to be snickering behind his back about dressing up in blackface or dressing up in Indian costumes or whatever else comes out,\u201d says Lisa Raitt, the Conservatives\u2019 deputy leader. \u201cWhat would you rather be going in with? \u2018He\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s diplomatic. I think we can work with him.\u2019 Or: \u2018Get a load of this guy. Why does he keep dressing up?\u2019\u201d", "description": "Andrew Scheer in many ways is the opposite of the charismatic, scandal-ridden Justin Trudeau.
