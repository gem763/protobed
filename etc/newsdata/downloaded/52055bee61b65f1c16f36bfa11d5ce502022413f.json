It's slowly starting to kind of take its groove,\" the 26-year-old American said. \"And then just making some putts.\"\n\nKorda, who has a 15-under total of 201, is making her first start since the Solheim Cup, where she went 3-0-1 last month in Scotland in the United States' loss to Europe. She has three LPGA Tour victories in Asia.\n\nDefending champion Danielle Kang is in second place after a 66 at Qizhong Garden in the first of four straight events in Asia. The American had bogeys on her first two holes to fall behind by four strokes, but played bogey-free golf the rest of the way, including six birdies and an eagle on the par-5 17th.\n\nSecond round leader Brooke Henderson (73) dropped back to third place. The 22-year-old Canadian, a two-time winner this season, fell behind early but recovered with an eagle on the par-4 10th. Henderson had a double bogey on the 18th to finish five strokes back.\n\nNasa Hataoka and Kristen Gillman are tied for fourth at 9 under, followed by Sei Young Kim and Angel Yin at 8 under.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
