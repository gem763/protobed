It is a potential franchise with what appears to be some serious staying power.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIt was a $96 million domestic haul for the Warner Brothers movie, making it far and away the highest grosser of the weekend. In fact, it is now the highest-grossing October film of all-time.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d star Joaquin Phoenix seemed to give a verbal wink at the idea that there could be another installment of the movie down the road, including what might be a bit of lobbying he\u2019s done with filmmaker Todd Phillips.\n\n\u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t have thought about this as my dream role,\u201d Phoenix said in an interview on Popcorn with Peter Travers.\n\n\u201cBut now, honestly, I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I talked to Todd a lot about what else we might be able to do, in general, just to work together, but also specifically, if there\u2019s something else we can do with Joker that might be interesting.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the domestic box office, the film adds $140.5 million from 73 international markets. The numbers dwarf the other top draws of the weekend, such as Universal\u2019s animated movie \u201cAbominable,\" which was second with $12 million. The \"Downton Abbey\" film, in its third week, fell to third with $8 million in sales but still has hauled in $73.6 million during its run.\n\nOf the top 40 movies in domestic theaters this weekend, \u201cJoker\u201d accounted for 64 percent of the box office.\n\nTalk that the movie\u2019s ending sets it up well for a franchise is certainly met with what seems to be a voracious appetite for the storyline, at least based on the opening weekend. Phoenix\u2019s intimations seem to point to an openness to pursue this storyline further.\n\nSpeculation that there could be another installment or two of the \u201cJoker\u201d franchise is also met with the reality that before its release, Phillips indicated that the movie would be a stand-alone film.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d exceeded expectations in the opening weekend but was clearly hurt by its R-rating and plenty of negative press. Controversy ranged from gun violence to dark themes, with concerns that there could be copycat crimes committed by viewers inspired by the dark storyline.\n\nDespite the strong opening weekend, \u201cJoker\u201d still is far from having the highest-grossing opening week of the year. \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d holds the top spot with $357 million for its opening weekend release in late April.\n\nThe Avengers film was helped by a PG-13 rating, underscoring the inherent limitations of \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Despite heavy criticism and an R-rating, \"Joker\" was the top-grossing film of the weekend and a potential franchise in the making.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP-Joker-Aurora-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
