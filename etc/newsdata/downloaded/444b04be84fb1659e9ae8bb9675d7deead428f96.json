If not the UK will leave with no deal.\n\n\u201cThe surrender act and its authors are undermining negotiations, but if EU leaders are betting that it will prevent no deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nBut an Elysee official told Reuters: \u201cThe president told [Mr Johnson] that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier\u2019s team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
