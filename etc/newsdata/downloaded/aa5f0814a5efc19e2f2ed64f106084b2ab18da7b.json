He is no stranger to seeing his team-mates racially abused on international duty - Henderson experienced Serbia, as an Under-21 player, in 2012 plus Montenegro earlier this year - but he was particularly furious on Monday.\n\nWhen the game was halted for a second time in the first half, Henderson was involved in a furious row with Krasimir Balakov and it is understood Bulgaria's manager told the 29-year-old: 'What is the problem? This is normal!' when he was confronted about the incidents that led to the stoppage.\n\nJordan Henderson has revealed England wanted to thump Bulgaria after suffering racist abuse\n\nRaheem Sterling (right) was one of the black players racially abused by some Bulgaria fans\n\nSupporters could be seen making offensive gestures and also made monkey chants\n\nEngland followed the UEFA Protocol and could have remained in the dressing room during the interval but Henderson says there was an unanimous desire to return to action and amass a scoreline to humiliate the Bulgarians. With better fortune, 6-0 could have been 10-0.\n\n'I wasn't happy with the situation,' said Henderson. 'It wasn't nice to be involved in and it shouldn't be happening in 2019 - it is very disappointing. But I felt, as a team, we dealt with it so well. We touched on (racism) before we came here just in case it did happen and, unfortunately, it did.\n\n'So we spoke and the decision was to carry on because if you leave the pitch and stop the game they win, really. That is how we looked at it. That was the message in the dressing room at half-time. We wanted to go out again and make them suffer and make their team suffer on the pitch. We did that.\n\n'To hear the announcement about the racism and then the whole stadium whistling was a bit strange, I'm sure something will be done. It was disgusting, it shouldn't be happening and something needs to be done about it.'\n\nHenderson called the scenes in Sofia 'disgusting' during the Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday\n\nPart of Henderson's fury was fuelled by the fact the incident had overshadowed Tyrone Mings' assured debut in the centre of England's defence but the vice-captain could not have been more effusive in his praise for how he, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford handled the situation.\n\n'They were outstanding,' said Henderson. 'Professionalism, class, discipline. Everything they did was outstanding. To be fair, I was angry. If I was angry I'm sure they were angry too. I thought Tyrone dealt with the situation so, so well. It was a top performance for his debut; he was magnificent.\n\n'That just shows the character in him and in the team and it will just make us stronger. If one player didn't want to carry on we would have stopped playing, simple as that, no problem. But everyone wanted to carry on and we wanted to let football do the talking.'", "description": "DOMINIC KING: Jordan Henderson has revealed England's ambition was to make Bulgaria's bigots suffer as he explained the players were not prepared to walk off.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/19/19755028-0-image-a-12_1571164972193.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
