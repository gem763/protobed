In reality, most of those who are prosecuted \u2014 and only about 1 in 5 border jumpers are \u2014 are sentenced to time served and are out within days.\n\nThe U.S. has one of the world\u2019s weaker laws for illegal entry, according to the data in a study by the Library of Congress, which surveyed statutes in more than 160 nations and released its findings amid a heated debate over whether America\u2019s penalties are too stiff.\n\nThe debate is being driven by the Democratic presidential candidates, some of whom have argued that the U.S. should eliminate the criminal penalty altogether. The data shows that\u2019s a bad idea, said Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for stricter immigration controls.\n\n\u201cIllegal immigration is a crime in almost every nation because regulating immigration is key to maintaining national sovereignty and identity, and citizens and leaders of every nation place a high value on that,\u201d Ms. Vaughan said. \u201cThere are good reasons why almost every other country in the world has similar criminal penalties, and we shouldn\u2019t flog people over it, but we do need the tools of arrest and detention to deal with the problem.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., illegal entry is criminalized under 8 US Code Section 1325, \u201cimproper entry by alien,\u201d which calls for a fine or imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Doing it a second time can earn a two-year sentence.\n\nThat is in addition to the civil penalty for being in the country without authorization, for which the result is deportation.\n\nThose policies are in line with laws in Canada and the United Kingdom, which also impose six-month maximum sentences on illegal entry, but, like the U.S., usually just deport border jumpers instead.\n\nA dozen other countries \u2014 including Iceland, Jordan and Guatemala \u2014 also have maximum six-month sentences, the Library of Congress reported.\n\nChina has perhaps the most complex laws, ranging from short detention and deportation to years in prison, depending on the circumstances.\n\nItaly\u2019s basic penalty is a fine, but in aggravated cases illegal entry can earn up to 15 years in prison, the researchers found.\n\nBeing armed, threatening to use force, inflicting damage or arriving as a group can earn heightened penalties in some places. But entering to claim asylum is often specifically exempted.\n\nSeveral dozen countries lack any criminal penalties, the researchers said, using deportation or expulsion but no possibility of jail time.\n\nThat\u2019s particularly true in Latin American countries, where Mexico, Brazil, El Salvador, Colombia and Venezuela don\u2019t envision time behind bars, the researchers found.\n\nThat is the direction some Democratic presidential candidates want to go.\n\nObama Cabinet secretary Julian Castro has driven the decriminalization debate. He used the first presidential primary debate in June to issue a challenge to fellow candidates to join him in repealing Section 1325.\n\nMr. Castro said the six-month misdemeanor penalty, which has been part of the law for decades, has been abused by the Trump administration, which used it last year as part of its zero tolerance border policy.\n\nBefore that policy, only about 20% of border jumpers were prosecuted for illegal entry. The rest were put into deportation proceedings. But under zero tolerance, the rate of prosecutions grew to about 50%, Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told Congress in July.\n\nMr. Castro\u2019s call drew praise from immigrant rights activists, who said he had set a new standard for the rest of the Democratic field. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, joined his call.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris embraced Mr. Castro\u2019s call but then appeared to retreat from that stance. She said she didn\u2019t want to decriminalize illegal entry but didn\u2019t think it should be a crime.\n\nMr. Castro\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Monday about the data showing the U.S. already at the low end of penalties.\n\nHis idea also has shown little traction on Capitol Hill. Indeed, there has been more movement in the other direction. Republicans introduced a bill last year that would have heightened the penalty for illegal entry by turning it into a felony punishable by one year in prison.\n\nThat legislation did not advance out of a subcommittee.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
