That\u2019s because attendants actually heard his voice screaming to let him out via a recording as his coffin was lowered into the ground.\n\n\u201cLet me out!\u201d he screamed (via speaker.) And this guy certainly knew his audience. Laughter immediately ripples throughout the crowd of mourners who had gathered.\n\nHis language was colorful, which is to be expected of this kind of character, and it looks like each and every family member appreciated the lighthearted gag.\n\n\u201cWas asked a question the other day, it was what\u2019s the difference between military humour and Civilian Humour it\u2019s simple it\u2019s black. This video should say it all,\u201d the Irish Defence Forces Veterans News shared on Facebook.\n\nThousands of commenters also mentioned they appreciated this move, sharing that they have had similar experience saying farewell to like-minded people who decided to give people a good time at their funerals.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of joke a young person might come up with, which means this guy never lost his joie de vivre.\n\nWhat a way to bang out of the world. Fun-loving until the very end and beyond.
