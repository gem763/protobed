You got an employee discount, and so on the last day I bought my first Lodge pan. It\u2019s just such an easy cooking tool. And it\u2019s so nice to season and have that history of all the dishes that are cooked in there and that perpetual seasoning going on. I don\u2019t have a ton of cookware, but that\u2019s one of my go-to items, most particularly for chicken taco meat every week, among other things. I made some blackened fish last night that was really great. And I love to just do some simple vegetables in there, like pan-charred veggies like broccoli and Brussels sprouts, fry some eggs in there. It\u2019s so easy and accessible for such a wide range of things.", "description": "We talked to Emily Hyland, co-founder of Pizza Loves Emily restaurants and a yoga instructor, about her favorite things, including a Madewell wallet, Nalgene water bottle, Lodge pan, beauty balm, Trader Joe\u2019s cheese crunchies, and more.", "authors": ["Emily Hyland", "Hilary Reid"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/03/wiclw-emily-hyland/03-wiclw-emily-hyland.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
