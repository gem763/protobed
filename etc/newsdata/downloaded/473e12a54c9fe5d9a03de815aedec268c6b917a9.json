It was his idea. It was a great idea.\"'\n\nLaBeouf told the AP he's better since meeting and bonding with Gottsagen two years ago, and has 'adopted a lot of his self-love and his confidence,' which has had a positive impact on his state of mind.\n\n'It's leading to self-love, which is leading to an ability to receive love, which is what was lacking in my life,' said the Transformers star. 'And I would run to alcohol. I just hated myself. Just a big self-hater.'\n\nLaBeouf opened up about how he bonded with Gottsagen, and how it helped him become sober after an extended period of boozing.\n\n'He knows about my pain intimately. We'd be sitting there watching wrestling every night. He'd be eating ice cream. I'd be drinking gin. I'd tell him, \"You gotta stop eating all that ice cream.\" He'd say, \"You gotta stop drinking that gin.\"\n\n'This man's a year older than me. He's been acting longer than me and he's healthier than I am. He has more friends than I have, has longer lasting loving relationships.'\n\nThe film, which captured the Audience Award at the SXSW festival earlier this year, also features Bruce Dern, Jon Bernthal, John Hawkes and Thomas Haden Church, as well as professional wrestling legends Jake 'The Snake' Roberts and Mick Foley.\n\nThe film opens in UK theatres on October 18.", "description": "Shia LaBeouf and Zack Gottsagen showed off their close bond as they attended the premiere of The Peanut Butter Falcon during the BFI London Film Festival on Thursday.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/18/19263468-0-image-a-15_1570122037958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
