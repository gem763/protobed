That can\u2019t happen,\u201d Minnesota DFL tweeted. \u201cHere\u2019s why this is bad news for Dems everywhere: 1) Donald Trump came within 1.5 percentage points (or 44,470 votes) of winning statewide in Minnesota in 2016. That\u2019s the 2nd closest Democratic state in the country after New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota DFL conceded that it cannot keep up with the Trump campaign\u2019s organization on the ground and emphasized that \u201cTrump almost winning Minnesota was not a fluke.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s why this is bad news for Dems everywhere: 1) Donald Trump came within 1.5 percentage points (or 44,470 votes) of winning statewide in Minnesota in 2016.

He\u2019s convinced he would have won if he had spent more time here in 2016, and his campaign manager has made it clear that MN is their TOP flip opportunity in the country. pic.twitter.com/Ct4IdM4uur \u2014 Minnesota DFL Party (@MinnesotaDFL) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cMinnesota, one of the last bastions of progressivism in the Midwest, has been trending more and more red in the last few presidential elections,\u201d Minnesota DFL noted. \u201cThe Trump campaign is staffing up in Minnesota in ways we\u2019ve never seen before, and frankly we just can\u2019t keep up. Trump and the GOP already have over two dozen staffers on the ground, and are promising more, and they have already trained over 600 volunteers in Minnesota!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Trump and Pence have already personally traveled to Minnesota SIX times in just the last two years. MN has the longest unbroken record of voting blue for president, and they\u2019re putting everything they\u2019ve got into flipping this state red. pic.twitter.com/4sxJmgu5hg \u2014 Minnesota DFL Party (@MinnesotaDFL) October 7, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: There is no path to a Democratic victory in the Presidential race without Minnesota in the blue column. If Trump flips MN red by flooding our state with money and campaign staff, we are guaranteed to have four more years of President Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/Bo5y6ITKA4 \u2014 Minnesota DFL Party (@MinnesotaDFL) October 7, 2019\n\nThe Minnesota DFL also pointed out that Trump is \u201cpersonally obsessed\u201d with winning Minnesota after he defied all of the political pundits and experts in 2016 when he almost flipped the state. The DFL warned that if Trump carries Minnesota, it will be nearly mathematically impossible for Democrats to take back the White House.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: There is no path to a Democratic victory in the Presidential race without Minnesota in the blue column,\u201d Minnesota DFL added. \u201cIf Trump flips MN red by flooding our state with money and campaign staff, we are guaranteed to have four more years of President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump will hold a Thursday evening rally at the Target Center in Minneapolis, and Minnesota GOP chair Jennifer Carnahan told CBS Minnesota on Sunday that \u201cthere have been nearly 100,000 people that have signed up online for tickets.\u201d", "description": "Ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s Thursday rally in the state, Minnesota Democrats revealed on Monday that they fear Trump\u2019s ambitious ground game in the state could help the president flip the state in 2020.\u00a0 | 2020 Election", "authors": ["Tony Lee"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/donald-trump-rally-wave-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
