The lack of reform has left taxpayers exposed to future bailouts,\u201d Mnuchin said in prepared remarks. \u201cNo conservatorship is meant to be permanent.\u201d\n\nWith all the reforms that have already taken place in the mortgage market, Compass Point Director of Policy Research Isaac Boltansky says it may simply be time for the government to be more hands-off.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of ways Fannie and Freddie are the unfinished business of the financial crisis,\u201d Boltansky told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d \u201cThe Fannie and Freddie of 2019 are not the Fannie and Freddie of 2007.\u201d\n\nBut they remain undercapitalized and are barred from holding more than $3 billion each to protect against losses. Under the government\u2019s control, they have access to additional funds from the Treasury Department if they run into trouble. The Trump administration wants to see that cap lifted and new private competitors take on some of the risk, a change that would require Congressional action.\n\nFILE - The Fannie Mae headquarters in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) More\n\nLawmakers have been unable to agree on what to do with Fannie and Freddie. And it seems unlikely this plan will get much bipartisan support. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., OH) said in the hearing today, this \u201cplan will make mortgages more expensive and harder to get.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is simply no path to passage for any comprehensive mortgage reform in this Congress,\u201d Boltansky said. That means few changes, for now, except some administrative reforms. And he says the White House knows it cannot mess with mortgage market.\n\n\u201cThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is sacrosanct in Washington,\u201d Boltansky said. \u201cIt\u2019s right up there in the pantheon of Americana with apple pie and American football.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe policy decision has been made to support the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, and Fannie and Freddie are the best transmission mechanism for mortgage credit given their role in the market,\u201d Boltansky said. \u201cThey are pillars of the mortgage market, they are necessary for the mortgage market to continue functioning.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPopeyes chicken sandwich: Inside a great American fast food success story\n\nHow investors can survive Trump's trade war tweet storms\n\n'Everybody\u2019s losing the trade war': Strategist\n\nBonds, yields, and why it matters when the yield curve inverts\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Mortgage reforms positive for private mortgage companies, analyst says", "authors": ["Scott Saloway"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8so7AIS9liJHDdIEQfWMQQ--~B/aD0zMjY3O3c9NDkwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5af6a780-d3e0-11e9-bdbf-767e52f4f9d9", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
