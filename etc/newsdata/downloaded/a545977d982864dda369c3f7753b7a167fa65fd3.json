It is what happened to a 17-year-old high school student in Alaska last Friday, after she was disqualified from a swim meet for allegedly wearing her swimsuit in a revealing way. She won the 100m freestyle at the Anchorage school meet, but the female referee made that void by putting the teenager's body appearance ahead of her performance.\n\nHer coach rightly challenged the decision, her mother called it \"sexual harassment\", blog posts were written, the news spread like wildfire and even tennis icon Billie Jean King got involved, tweeting \"the constant policing of women's bodies is offensive, sexist and wrong. This must end\".\n\nOn Tuesday, four days since the race, the school district announced that the decision would be overturned and the referee's certification revoked, as well as suspending the swimsuit coverage rule that states they must \u201ccover the buttocks and breasts\u201d which the district called \"ambiguous\".\n\nSome will be thinking, who cares? This is a high school swimmer and the issue has been resolved. But the fact that this still happens points firmly to the idea that body shaming remains a stark reality for women in sport - and girls in this case.\n\nThe swimmer in question was wearing the same swimsuit as her teammates, one issued by her high school and in accordance with uniform regulations. She had worn it at three separate meets prior and had never been penalised. Even her competitors were wearing matching styles, and yet she was the only athlete disqualified. Some onlookers at the meet have since claimed the girl was targeted based on her curvier body shape, others have speculated it was not only sexist but also racist, as she was the only mixed-race swimmer at the meet.\n\nOne of Alaska\u2019s top swimmers who had just won her race was disqualified by a ref because of how her school-issued swimsuit fit her body. The constant policing of women\u2019s bodies is offensive, sexist, and wrong. This must end. https://t.co/DwzvOSiqLz \u2014 Billie Jean King (@BillieJeanKing) September 10, 2019\n\nIn a statement, the school district confirmed that she had been singled-out: \"[We have] concluded that our swimmer was targeted based solely on how a standard, school-issued uniform happened to fit the shape of her body. We cannot tolerate discrimination of any kind, and certainly not based on body shape.\"\n\nTo be clear, she was specifically shamed because her body shape differed from the girls around her, she was 'curvier' and so their identical team swimsuits fit her body type differently and somehow this was deemed inappropriate. She was said to be \"heartbroken\" following the events and it is easy to understand why. The Alaska swimmer has experienced other body shaming episodes throughout her relatively short sporting career, as The Washington Post reports that a parent at the school last year took a photograph of her from behind and circulated it among the other parents as evidence of the inappropriate wearing of the swimsuits. She has repeatedly been told her body is indecent, problematic, and the repercussions of that cannot begin to be measured on a personal level.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely very distraught about the whole situation,\u201d the swimmer\u2019s strength and conditioning coach, DeWayne Ingram, told the Telegraph Sport. \u201cBeing an athlete who truly is such a hard worker, now to have all the attention shifted towards her body and image has been very hurtful. She\u2019s having to process being body shamed as a teenager.\u201d\n\nBut this is not an isolated issue either, it is one that affects many school-age girls. A survey conducted earlier this year by the Telegraph Women's Sport found that nearly 30 per cent of girls cited not liking people watching them do sport as a deterrent to participating in PE. A survey from this paper with elite female athletes also revealed that a staggering 72 per cent of them feel judged on the way they look. It suggests the preoccupations girls experience at school continue throughout their sporting lives, even at the highest level.", "description": "Imagine at age 17, when all the pressures of social media, image-consciousness and insecurities are at their peak, being publicly body shamed and prematurely sexualised while competing at a school sporting event.", "authors": ["Molly Mcelwee"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YO7T.NMcO0NkbPvkopUcPQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/9bf65a77f4ae361eea53eda638c1a7d1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
