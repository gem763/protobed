But don't sleep on the horror genre's TV canon, which, admittedly, is not as large as it is in film, but still can scare with the best of them.\n\nFor your Halloween pleasure, we've rounded up our five favorite horror TV shows that are available to stream. Watch at your own risk. And maybe during the daylight.\n\nIf you like when movies and TV collide: 'Hannibal'\n\nMads Mikkelsen stars in NBC's 'Hannibal.' (Photo: Brooke Palmer, NBC)\n\nThere are few series as graphic, terrifying and visually stunning as \"Hannibal\" that have ever made it onto broadcast TV. But NBC's low-rated gem pushed the envelope every chance it got, as it brought Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen) to life. This is not the horror series for someone with a weak stomach.\n\nStream it on Amazon.\n\nIf you ever wished 'Glee' was scarier: 'American Horror Story'\n\nConnie Britton, Dylan McDermott and Taissa Farmiga in \"American Horror Story: Murder House.\" (Photo: Robert Zuckerman, FX Network)\n\nOver the course of its eight seasons, Ryan Murphy's horror anthology has proved itself to be a uniquely campy, gory and psychological entry into the horror canon, one of the best applications of the genre on TV. Just remember that not every season of \"AHS\" is created equal. \"Cult\" and \"Hotel\" are particularly bad, \"Asylum\" and \"Murder House\" are the best, hands down, and the rest range from the average to the very uneven. We can't say for sure if the currently airing season, \"Apocalypse,\" will fall on the good or bad end of the spectrum.So far, it's started off with a blast, pun intended.\n\nStream it on Netflix YouTubeTV or Hulu.\n\nIf you love urban legends: 'Channel Zero'\n\nAmy Forsyth as Margot on 'Channel Zero: No End House.' (Photo: Allen Fraser, Syfy)\n\nLike \"AHS,\" Syfy's \"Channel Zero\" is an anthology horror series where each season follows a different story. Unlike \"AHS,\" \"Zero\" brings to life Internet urban legends and myths, making it some of the most unique horror you'll see, as well as horror that's intensely rooted in our modern sensibilities.\n\nStream it on YouTube TV.\n\nIf you love the gothic: 'Penny Dreadful'\n\nJosh Hartnett and Eva Green \"Penny Dreadful.\" (Photo: Jonathan Hession, SHOWTIME)\n\nMixing and mashing characters from classic gothic literature including \"Frankenstein,\" \"Dracula,\" \"Dorian Grey,\" and \"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde,\" Showtime's series was a mastery as both a horror show and a period piece. With Eva Greene and Josh Hartnett leading the series with incredible performances, \"Dreadful\" was the rare horror show that could both terrify and delight.\n\nStream it on Netflix, YouTube TV or Showtime.\n\nIf you want to be afraid of your smartphone: 'Black Mirror'\n\nWyatt Russell's about to play a game that is all too real. (Photo: Laurie Sparham/Netflix)\n\nThe episodes of the British sci-fi anthology range in genre from romance to action adventure to sociological study to outright horror, being known mostly for the latter. Whether you like psychological torment, jump scares, creepy creatures or all of the above, there's a \"Mirror\" episode for you.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/10/20/halloween-5-best-horror-tv-shows-binge-watch-weekend/1614687002/", "description": "Don't sleep on the horror genre's TV canon.
