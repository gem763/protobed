Donald Trump!' Little kids encouraged by teachers to chant against president", "language": "en", "text": "If you need proof that our nation\u2019s public education system has been taken over by leftist radicals who have weaponized children for political purposes, look no further than a September 16th immigration protest on the streets of San Francisco.\n\nHundreds of school children were filmed chanting, \u201cWho do we hate? Donald Trump!\u201d during a protest in support of illegal immigrants in downtown San Francisco.\n\nMargaret Vandenberg, a conservative filmmaker and producer, posted video of the shocking chants on Twitter. She was a guest Monday on \"The Todd Starnes Radio Show.\" Click here to listen to the interview.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER A COPY OF TODD\u2019S NEW BOOK, \u201cCULTURE JIHAD: HOW TO STOP THE LEFT FROM KILLING A NATION.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all know that indoctrination happens at the college level, and to some extent at the high school level, but to see it happening to students as young as kindergarten is unbelievable,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people need to be called out.\u201d\n\nTelevision station KGO reported that one of the schools involved in the protest was the Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community School.\n\nVideo shows the children being coached off camera as they chanted, \u201cbrick by brick, wall by wall, the border wall will fall.\u201d\n\nVandenberg said she was shocked to see adults using grade-schoolers as political pawns and \u201ccramming a social justice agenda down the throats of children.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to me that we have this radical leftist agenda and these activist teachers in San Francisco public schools who see it as their job not to educate students but to indoctrinate them,\u201d she said on my radio program.\n\nWhen Vandenberg attempted to interview children at the march teachers intervened and threatened to notify the police. I reached out to school leaders and they did not return my calls.\n\nWhat happened on the streets of San Francisco should horrify every freedom-loving American.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine the outrage if this had been a conservative event, if this had been a Trump rally or an NRA event or a March for Life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe outrage would\u2019ve been unbelievable, but these people seem to see no issue with what they\u2019ve done.\n\nThat\u2019s a fair point to explore. During the Obama administration, public schools lavished great adoration on the president.\n\nRemember the New Jersey school children who sang praise songs in his honor? \u201cBarack Hussein Obama, mmm mmm mmm,\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThose days are long gone and now we have at least one public school teaching boys and girls to hate President Trump.\n\nChapter 12 of my new book, \u201cCulture Jihad,\u201d is titled, \u201cReading, Writing and Radicals.\u201d I document how our classrooms have been overrun by progressives who are hell-bent on brainwashing American kids.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhat happened on the streets of San Francisco should horrify every freedom-loving American.\n\nThose children should be learning about math and science.
