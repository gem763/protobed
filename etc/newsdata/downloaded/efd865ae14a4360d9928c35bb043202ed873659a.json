That could be a more aggressive attempt to end its longstanding authority to set its own emissions rules or threats to dissuade auto makers from collaborating further with the state, these people say.\n\nThe White House has been proposing to ease requirements originally set under the Obama administration. The Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Transportation are overseeing the rule-making process.\n\nAuto makers are worried the administration\u2019s efforts are too confrontational with California and will result in a protracted legal battle between the federal government and the nation\u2019s most populous state. That could force manufacturers to meet two sets of tailpipe-emissions standards for selling cars and trucks in the U.S., a scenario industry executives say will compromise future vehicle planning.\n\nTo ensure some certainty in future years, Ford Motor Co. , Honda Motor Co., BMW AG and Volkswagen AG struck an agreement this summer with California to voluntarily meet a new set of standards that are tougher than the White House\u2019s proposal\u2014but tamer than the Obama era ones.\n\nThe companies have said the pact was intended to show support for a single, nationwide vehicle-emissions standard, rather than a patchwork of state-by-state rules. But the move by California frustrated some administration officials who viewed it as a disruptive power play, said one senior official and others briefed on the White House\u2019s reaction.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly our rule is realistic, it\u2019s a realistic and transparent fuel-economy standard that will reduce auto pollution\u2014unlike what California is doing,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said. \u201cOur focus is finalizing the rule.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for the California governors\u2019 office and the California Air Resources Board didn\u2019t return a request to comment.\n\nCalifornia has a federal waiver to set its own emissions rules, which the Trump administration wants to revoke to limit the state\u2019s influence over the auto industry. California sets its own greenhouse gas emissions under a waiver first granted by the EPA in 2009 and again in 2013.\n\nThirteen other states follow California\u2019s rules\u2014representing roughly one-third of overall U.S. auto sales last year\u2014giving California\u2019s air regulators wide power over national standards.\n\nOther auto makers, such as Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co. so far have been reluctant to join the California agreement, but their executives are also concerned about the uncertainty of a legal fight.\n\nOn Thursday, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra met with President Trump at the White House for a scheduled meeting to discuss jobs and trade issues, including China, as well as the administration\u2019s efforts to reshape the fuel-economy requirements.\n\nIn completing the new rules, administration officials have also taken steps to enhance their chances of ending California\u2019s waiver by separating the effort from the broader emissions rule-making process, say people familiar with the strategy.\n\nThe White House\u2019s efforts to expedite the final rule-making process still faces high legal hurdles, and its resources are stretched by other deregulatory efforts\u2014and now a major hurricane. It is already months behind schedule in relaxing the current requirements, a priority for the White House since the start of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nWithin days of his taking office, car companies began lobbying Mr. Trump for relief on the Obama era standards, arguing they were too strict and didn\u2019t take into account the shift in consumer preference for trucks and SUVs that burn more fuel.\n\nExecutives, however, didn\u2019t expect such a drastic rollback by the administration, which wants to freeze the Obama era fuel economy standards at 2020 levels, or roughly 37 miles a gallon. The Obama-era rules call for annual increases in fuel economy to an average of roughly 50 miles a gallon by mid-decade.\n\nSeparating the effort to strip California of its waiver from the rest of the emissions rule-making process would be a new, more aggressive step. It could insulate the challenge from being overturned if the administration loses a court battle on the merits or rationale of its proposed changes to the fuel-economy mandates, according to legal experts.\n\n\u201cTrump, as a politician, is concerned about the visuals, the theatrics of it, how it plays with the public,\u201d said Myron Ebell, a former member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team and the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cHe wants to put California in a box.\u201d\n\nCar makers, California and Trump administration officials have said from the presidency\u2019s earliest days they wanted to preserve one national fuel-economy standard for all 50 states. But negotiations with California to align their rules have been fraught, and the Trump administration said earlier this year it would no longer work with state officials to reshape the rules, breaking off talks.\n\nCalifornia has responded with lawsuits and promises of more legal action. State officials first sued the EPA last year over its move to reconsider the Obama-era targets and have indicated they would challenge any threat to its emissions waiver in court.\n\n\u2014Mike Colias contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com and Ben Foldy at Ben.Foldy@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration is pressing regulators to speed up the rollout of new tailpipe-emission rules, an attempt to strike back at California for making a side deal with several auto makers.", "authors": ["Timothy Puko", "Ben Foldy", "Tim.Puko Wsj.Com", "Ben.Foldy Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104426/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
