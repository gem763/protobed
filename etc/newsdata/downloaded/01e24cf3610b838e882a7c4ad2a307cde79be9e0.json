Now, a federal commission wants to limit local educators\u2019 control again.\n\nTeachers should be feeling whiplash.\n\nIn December, the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department rescinded federal directives that said Washington would investigate schools based on the number of times teachers and principals suspended or expelled minority students\u2014even if the offending students had committed violence. A school could have lost federal funding as a result.\n\nThe rules came from a 2014 Obama administration letter sent to districts around the country instructing educators to limit such punishments, even if a student was a danger to his or her peers.\n\nThis 2014 letter mirrored the ideas from Broward County, Florida, where the school district limited suspensions and expulsions\u2014and created a bureaucratic mess.\n\nThe accused February 2018 shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School slipped through the school district\u2019s discipline program. In middle school, educators referred the accused shooter to Broward County\u2019s program, a set of interventions designed to \u201creduce student arrests.\u201d But the district admitted last May that administrators have no record of what, if anything, was completed.\n\nFollowing the tragic deaths of 17 students, faculty and staff and the wounding of 17 others at the Parkland, Florida, school, Broward school officials have faced scrutiny for their handling of the shooting. Then-Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel and a several deputies were fired in connection with the disaster.\n\nOver the years, as other district administrators followed federal guidance and limited student discipline, teachers reported feeling less safe in school and increased levels of harmful student behavior, as reported by the Manhattan Institute.\n\nStudies from Florida and Philadelphia have found that leaving disruptive students in the classroom is related to negative academic outcomes for the peers of the offending students.\n\nBut in 2018, after the Broward County tragedy, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos led the Federal Commission on School Safety, which conducted hearings around the country seeking input from educators. The commission released a report containing best practices from local schools on safety, mental health, and student discipline.\n\nThe final report also called for the rescission of the 2014 \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter, and the departments of Education and Justice followed the recommendation.\n\nThe Federal Commission on School Safety explained its recommendation in the final report:\n\nThe [2014 Obama administration] Guidance sent the unfortunate message that the federal government, rather than teachers and local administrators, best handles school discipline.\n\nAs a result, fearful of potential investigations, some school districts may have driven their discipline policies and practices more by numbers than by teacher input.\n\nIn a report released Tuesday, however, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights announced it had voted in favor of federal monitoring of school suspensions and expulsions, and criticized the use of exclusionary discipline.\n\nThe commission praised the 2014 guidance, saying the \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter \u201cprovided schools with important information about what the law is and how to address school-discipline problems in a nondiscriminatory way.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Rights Commission claims the guidance was just \u201cdetailed information about what the law is,\u201d but the 2014 \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter sounded like Washington was looking for reasons to investigate.\n\nThe letter said schools should use \u201cexclusionary discipline as a last resort\u201d and contained an appendix with specific methods of data collection related to student discipline, restorative justice practices, and collaboration with law enforcement.\n\nThe commission\u2019s recommendations would take a school\u2019s focus off of school safety and student success in exchange for counting how many students of a particular race are disciplined, even if the students did something to warrant suspension.\n\nThe civil rights panel\u2019s recommendations also suggest that federal agents should be more involved in local decision-making, taking authority away from parents, teachers, and school principals.\n\nParents and teachers know that all children are different and that situations involving punishment must be handled differently, specific to the circumstances.\n\nIn her dissent from the Civil Rights Commission\u2019s recommendations, commission member Gail Heriot said that in schools with majority-minority student enrollment, \u201cif teachers fail to keep order in those classrooms out of fear that they will be accused of racism, it is these minority students who will suffer the most.\u201d\n\nNo children should be disciplined just because of the color of their skin. But the commission\u2019s deference to the Obama administration\u2019s heavy-handed letter favors bureaucrats over you and your child\u2019s teachers.\n\nDeVos and federal officials made the right decision last December in rescinding the Obama-era guidance. Parents and teachers, not federal bureaucrats, should make decisions about student safety.", "description": "Washington late last year reversed a policy that was micromanaging the way teachers and principals kept order in classrooms.
