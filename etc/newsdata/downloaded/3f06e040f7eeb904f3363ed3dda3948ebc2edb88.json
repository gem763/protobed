Fr\u00f6mel highlighted this in his original announcement on the BleepingComputer forum yesterday morning, but urged readers to understand that he\u2019s \u201cnot the bad guy here.\u201d\n\nThe Muhstik ransomware hackers have plagued QNAP\u2019s Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices since the end of September.\n\nThey\u2019ve found success by brute-forcing their way into devices with weak passwords, encrypting files and demanding 0.09 BTC ($700) of their victims to unlock them.\n\nAnd it goes on like that\u2026\n\nAs for Fr\u00f6mel, though, it seems unlikely he\u2019ll suffer any ramifications, but a ZDNet report indicates that at least one security researcher has made authorities aware of the situation.\n\nStill, he\u2019s on Twitter notifying other victims that his decryption software is available for free. So far, Fr\u00f6mel has received two tips for his efforts, worth a combined 0.01148348 BTC ($94).\n\nRansomware attacks are nothing new, but they have been intensifying lately. The FBI even recently shared a public service announcement warning against paying to restore files as it could encourage further campaigns.\n\nAlthough, this hasn\u2019t stopped victims from giving in. Three hospitals in Alabama recently paid the hackers behind the Ryuk ransomware to unlock compromised systems which had been infected at the start of October.\n\nYou can read up on how to protect yourself against ransomware here.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
