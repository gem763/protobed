It's not her job - she's the head of state. She is not the head of government or the political process in Britain\u2026 and she knows that as well. \"\n\nJust as the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club, the first rule of the relationship between the prime minister and the Queen is that you never, ever talk about the relationship between the PM and the Queen.\n\nA Buckingham Palace source told the BBC that there was an amount of displeasure at David Cameron's comments.\n\nYou can probably read that as cold fury. Not just because he has broken the first rule. But because he has made it painfully clear that in 2014 he used the Queen for his own political purposes. And that she and her advisors thought that was OK.\n\nThe revelation comes as her suspension of Parliament - a suspension made on the effective instruction of Boris Johnson - comes under unprecedented scrutiny in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe two cases are very different, but they both highlight the dark greys of the Queen's constitutional position, the discretion she has or lacks, under extraordinary circumstances, to speak out and act.\n\nIt is not the first time Mr Cameron has been accused of indiscretion in his dealings with the Queen.\n\nMr Cameron apologised to the monarch in 2014 after he was overheard saying she \"purred\" on hearing the result of the Scottish referendum.\n\nHe said talking about her reaction had been a \"terrible mistake\".", "description": "The ex-PM says he asked the Queen to \"raise an eyebrow\" over the Scottish independence vote in 2014.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nqx9d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
