However, the day belonged to Longstaff.\n\nEXTRA SPECIAL\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit in awe really,\u201d a beaming Longstaff said alongside his proud brother. \u201cLast night I was dreaming about this but never thought it would happen.\n\n\u201cI found out yesterday that I was playing, the butterflies started yesterday but I\u2019ve been looking forward to it ever since.\n\n\u201cTo get the goal in front of the Gallowgate makes it extra special.\u201d\n\nHis brother added: \u201cHe\u2019s been the best player in training. He was a breath of fresh air. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of him.\u201d\n\nNewcastle, thrashed 5-0 at Leicester City last week, were well-organised at the back and looked the more threatening side in a dreary first half.\n\nAfter 28 minutes the livewire Allan Saint-Maximin set up Longstaff with a short pass and the teenager\u2019s dipping effort beat De Gea but not the woodwork.\n\nSean Longstaff then played in Miguel Almiron with a quarterback-type delivery but the Paraguayan delayed his shot too long and his effort was blocked by Maguire.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s side had plenty of possession but United\u2019s England striker Marcus Rashford was anonymous and touched the ball only nine times before the interval.\n\nSoccer Football - Premier League - Newcastle United v Manchester United - St James' Park, Newcastle, Britain - October 6, 2019 Newcastle United's Matthew Longstaff celebrates scoring their first goal Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith\n\nThe visitors should have scored though when Maguire was unmarked from a corner but his header was mistimed and went wide.\n\nFormer Toon Army fan favourite Andy Carroll, enjoying a return to his hometown club, came off the bench for Newcastle in the 52nd minute but the supporters found a new hero.\n\nWhen Saint-Maximin teased the United defence again it allowed Longstaff to advance into space on the edge of the area and when the ball was played back to him he only had one thought as he lashed his shot low into the corner.", "description": "Newcastle United's Matthew Longstaff enjoyed a dream Premier League debut by scoring a late winner as his side beat visitors Manchester United 1-0 to move out of the bottom three on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437792886&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF950HN", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
