Biden has proved remarkably resilient to attacks, gaffes and health scares. Now his unshakable lead in the polls has his political allies fighting off the perception that he is becoming the inevitable nominee.\n\nThe aura of inevitability can be a campaign killer, sapping supporters\u2019 enthusiasm and depressing turnout for the only polls that matter: the caucuses and primaries. Just ask Hillary Clinton how inevitability turns into startling defeat on Election Day.\n\n\u201cThat is a dangerous mindset to have. You have to always think that your opponents are right on your tail and keep fighting as hard as you can,\u201d said Jon Cooper, a major Democratic fundraising bundler who is backing Mr. Biden.\n\nMr. Biden will be taking that mindset to the stage Thursday when he joins nine of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination in Houston.\n\nMr. Cooper said he is confident Mr. Biden will secure the nomination because the former vice president is widely viewed as the best candidate to beat President Trump. However, he expected the race to tighten and eventually become a three-way contest among Mr. Biden and two far-left contenders, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernard Sanders of Vermont.\n\n\u201cNothing is inevitable in politics. Things can change dramatically from one week to the next. But I think he will be the nominee,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cHis lead will be maintained and solidified, and at the end of the day, when he faces the final challengers in the primary, he will be very well positioned.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren and Mr. Sanders will be flanking Mr. Biden on the debate stage Thursday.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris of California; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; entrepreneur Andrew Yang; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro also will have their chance to dent Mr. Biden.\n\nMr. Biden, however, has shown an uncanny ability to bounce back whenever his rivals appear to have him on the ropes.\n\nIn the June debate in Miami, Mr. Biden fumbled for an answer when confronted by Ms. Harris for his opposition in the 1970s to federally mandated busing to integrate public schools.\n\nBut the attack by Ms. Harris, a woman of color, failed to dislodge black voters, who overwhelmingly prefer Mr. Biden. Instead, black voters in places such as early-voting South Carolina rallied behind Mr. Biden.\n\nSouth Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, who has endorsed Mr. Biden, said his staying power comes from the fact that people know him after eight years as President Obama\u2019s right-hand man and more than 30 years in the Senate.\n\n\u201cNo matter what people are going to sling at him, people really see the true Joe,\u201d she said.\n\nThe challenge for Team Biden is managing expectations. At this point, a dip in the polls for Mr. Biden would be regarded as a sea change in the Democratic race.\n\nOthers have caved under similar circumstances. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry blasted into the 2012 Republican presidential race with sky-high expectations only to crash after a cringeworthy debate performance.\n\nThe Biden campaign is walking a fine line between touting his front-runner status and playing down the impression that he is running away with the nomination.\n\nWhen a recent national poll by Monmouth University showed Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders inch ahead of Mr. Biden by a single percentage point, the Biden campaign reached out to reporters to call the survey \u201can outlier\u201d and impugn its methodology.\n\n\u201cPoll after poll also confirms that, because of the high stakes of this election, Democratic primary voters are the most energized about a nominee who can take on and defeat Donald Trump and the atrocious values he represents, and win the battle we\u2019re in for the soul of this nation,\u201d a Biden campaign official said. \u201cJoe Biden is by all accounts the candidate best positioned to make that happen.\u201d\n\nIndeed, most polls showed Mr. Biden sustaining a big lead regardless of his stumbles and traumas on the trail.\n\nConcerns about the health of Mr. Biden, 76, resurfaced last week when blood pooled in his eye during a CNN town hall forum on climate change.\n\nThe red eye was assumed to be a subconjunctival hemorrhage, which occurs when a tiny blood vessel breaks just underneath the clear surface of the eye. It is usually harmless, but it rekindled memories of Mr. Biden\u2019s near-fatal aneurysms in the 1980s.\n\nMr. Biden later said he poked himself in the eye while removing a contact lens. \u201cIt was my contact lens,\u201d he told The Laconia (Iowa) Daily Sun. \u201cI think I \u2014 you know when you\u2019re taking it out \u2014 I think bruised my eye.\u201d\n\nA poll released Tuesday showed the eye incident didn\u2019t ding Mr. Biden as he once again scored a double-digit lead. He was the top choice of 33% of potential Democratic primary voters, followed by Mr. Sanders at 21% and Ms. Warren at 16%, the Morning Consult poll found.\n\nThe results were largely in line with the weekly tracking poll since July.\n\nMs. Harris was next at 7%, followed by Mr. Buttigieg at 5%. Mr. O\u2019Rourke, Mr. Booker and Mr. Yang were tied at 3% each.\n\n\u201cOne of the challenges about front-runner status is that there are additional pressures that other campaigns don\u2019t face,\u201d said Democratic strategist Zach Friend, noting the extra scrutiny of debate performances, the dissection of every poll and the expectations of a top finish in the leadoff Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cFor Vice President Biden, his polling has been resilient, but as the race settles into a top three or five candidates, it will be interesting to see if the polling continues its resiliency as candidates drop out and the race becomes more focused,\u201d Mr. Friend said.\n\n\u201cThe one unifying factor across the Democratic Party is the bumper sticker that says \u2018The Democrat 2020.\u2019 Meaning Democrats want someone that can win in November of 2020, and as long as Vice President Biden is seen as a leader in that narrative, then it seems likely that he will be one of the leaders in delegates heading into the convention next year,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u2981 Seth McLaughlin reported from Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
