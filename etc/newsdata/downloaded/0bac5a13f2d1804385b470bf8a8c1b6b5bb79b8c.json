All northbound lanes had reopened by around 6 p.m.\n\nHoward County Police said in a statement that they responded to a report of drug activity in a vehicle in the 9100 block of All Saints Road in Laurel around 2:15 p.m. when the driver fled the scene.\n\nWhen officers attempted to stop the vehicle, the driver drove onto northbound I-95 at Route 216 and, investigators believe, tried to make an illegal U-turn into the southbound lane of the interstate at a high speed, when he lost control and was struck by a tractor-trailer.\n\nThe driver of the suspect vehicle died, police said, and a passenger in the vehicle was hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nPolice said the driver of the tractor-trailer was hospitalized with minor injuries. Another vehicle was run off the road during the crash, according to police, and the driver of that vehicle was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n\nThe name of the driver who died was not immediately available.\n\nAll southbound lanes of the highway were blocked into Thursday evening\u2019s rush hour, and traffic was diverted to Route 32, according to the Metropolitan Area Transportation Operations Coordination Program. Officials had temporarily blocked two northbound left lanes to allow southbound traffic to turn around as two northbound lanes got by, according to the agency, and delays stretched more than seven miles in both directions. All northbound lanes later reopened.\n\nTraffic maps showed a snarl of congestion between Washington and Baltimore around 6 p.m., with I-95 and secondary roads clogged from the northern edge of the Washington Beltway to the southern edge of the Baltimore Beltway.", "description": "Police pursued a vehicle after a report of suspected drug activity.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
