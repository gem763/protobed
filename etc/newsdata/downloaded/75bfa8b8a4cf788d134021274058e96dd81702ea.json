But defenders of the tradition have said the characters\u2019 faces are black because of the many chimneys they climb down to deliver presents.\n\nThe controversy has at times erupted in violence. In 2017, defenders of the tradition clashed with opponents at a motorway in Eindhoven, where a brawl broke out and arrests were made, according to The Guardian.\n\nBLACKFACE MAKEUP CHARGE IS BOGUS, 'THE CHALLENGE' STAR GEORGIA HARRISON SAYS\n\nJerry Afriyie, who has been campaigning with the group Kick Out Zwarte Piet for over a decade, called the news \u201ca beautiful historic day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for everyone who strives for an inclusive parade that will delight all children,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want the tradition to continue for thousands of years \u2013 but adapted to the times.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThough the blackface character remains relatively popular, nationwide polls cited by The Guardian reflect a waning approval. In 2013, 89 percent of the Dutch favored the character. Four years later, support stood at 68 percent.", "description": "A\u00a0Netherlands\u2019 Christmastime parade that\u00a0for years\u00a0featured white people wearing blackface makeup\u00a0is doing away with that tradition after public backlash and, at times, violent protests.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
