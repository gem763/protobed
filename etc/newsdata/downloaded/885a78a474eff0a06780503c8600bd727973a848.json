Gavin Newsom. Wheeler is demanding a detailed plan for fixing the problems within 30 days.\n\nThe letter says \u201cpiles of human feces on sidewalks and streets\u201d could cause water contamination. It criticizes San Francisco for routinely discharging inadequately treated sewage into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nWheeler says if the state doesn\u2019t meet its responsibilities, EPA will have to take action.\n\nThe letter escalates a feud between the Trump administration and California, a predominantly Democratic state that has fought the administration\u2019s efforts to weaken environmental regulations.", "description": "In a letter, it says, \u201cpiles of human feces on sidewalks and streets\u201d could cause water contamination.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GH830_homele_ZG_20180423134959.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
