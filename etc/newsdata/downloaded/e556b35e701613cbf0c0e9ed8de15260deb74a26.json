Getty Images\n\nRead on for our New York Fashion Week highlights so far.\n\nPrabal Gurung asked \u2018Who gets to be American?\u2019\n\nThe Nepalese-American designer likes to pack a political punch at fashion week. In the wake of #MeToo, while most brands scrambled to find ways to promote female empowerment, Gurung was five steps ahead.\n\nNot only did his models walk the finale together, hand in hand while holding white flowers \u2013 a symbolic gesture of unity for #MeToo \u2013 but he invited the movement\u2019s founder, Tarana Burke, to sit in his front row, a spot usually reserved for editors and celebrities.\n\nThis season, Gurung took aim at the Trump administration, dressing models in sashes with the words: \u201cWho gets to be American?\u201d splashed across them, referencing the president\u2019s notoriously draconian immigration policies.\n\nExplaining his intentions in a statement, Gurung said: \u201cIn the last few years, incited by the divisive rhetoric of our current administration, I\u2019ve considered the many faces of America and how we should seek to redefine it.\u201d\n\nThe fashion designer added that the aim of his latest collection, which marks the 10th anniversary of his brand, is \u201cto celebrate hope, courage, and present an ode to the true American dream\u201d.\n\nRalph Lauren created a one-night-only Jazz club\n\nRalph Lauren has a penchant for grandeur. While the heritage American designer usually realises such an aesthetic exclusively through his designs \u2013 sweeping metallic gowns and classic tailoring \u2013 this season saw Lauren kick things up a notch, or 20.\n\nFor his spring/summer 2020 show, the 79-year-old fashion titan created \u201cRalph\u2019s Club\u201d: a one-night-only jazz club inspired by the majestic hedonism of the 1920s. Singer Janelle Monae performed a lineup of jazz classics as fashion editors exchanged tattletales over glasses of champagne before fawning over muses including Bella and Gigi Hadid, who hit the runway in a menagerie of vintage-inspired designs.\n\nZendaya teamed up with Tommy Hilfiger for a 1970s Harlem party\n\nFor the actor\u2019s second collection with Hilfiger, she provided a heady dose of nostalgia by sending models down the runway in an array of 1970s staples. Tailored jackets were paired with houndstooth neck ties while wide-brimmed hats and bug-eyed shades led the way in terms of accessories.\n\nElsewhere, androgyny played a key role, with three-piece suits and loose-fitting trousers. The velvet count was heavy, too, with rich shades of wine providing a pleasant change from the overwhelmingly monochrome palette.\n\nA nine-year-old double amputee made fashion week history\n\nOn Saturday, double amputee Daisy-May Demetre made her debut at New York Fashion Week at just nine years old.\n\nThe Birmingham-born child walked the runway for luxury childrenswear label Lulu et Gigi wearing a knee-length dress that proudly showed off her prosthetic legs.\n\nDemetre was born with fibular hemimelia, a defect where part or all of the fibula bone in the leg is missing. Neither of her feet developed properly due to her condition, meaning she was unable to balance or move properly. The youngster has a promising career in modelling ahead of her, having revealed she will also be walking in Paris Fashion Week later this month.", "description": "New York Fashion Week marks the start of a month-long sartorial spectacle as designers showcase their latest creations to editors, buyers and influencers.
