He didn't say it's despicable, which I just say it is.\"\n\nCoppola also said he was working on his biggest project yet: \"Megalopolis\", a film about a utopia, a project he has nurtured for two decades.\n\n\"I wanted to make a film about a human expression of what really is heaven on earth. I would say it's the most ambitious film (I've worked on) -- more than 'Apocalypse Now'. That's the problem,\" he added.\n\n\"Apocalypse Now\", his 1979 war epic starring Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando, is notorious for the vast amount of time and money it ate up during production.\n\n\"I think it would cost more than 'Apocalypse Now',\" said Coppola. \"It would be the biggest budget I ever had to work with.\"\n\nCoppola, the director of the \"Godfather\" films, joins an illustrious list of filmmakers and actors to have received the Prix Lumiere, including Scorsese, Pedro Almodovar and Milos Forman.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Francis Ford Coppola jumped into a controversy over the Marvel superhero movies Saturday, not just backing fellow director Martin Scorsese's critique of the films but denouncing them as \"despicable\".
