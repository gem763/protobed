Naomi Fry observed that he appeared despondent. \u201cAffleck\u2019s was the kind of middle-aged-white-male sadness that the Internet loves to mock,\u201d she wrote, \u201ca mocking that depends, simultaneously, on a complete rejection of this sadness, as well as a hedging identification with it.\u201d How was \u201cwhite-male sadness\u201d at the dissolution of a marriage presumptively different from what a woman of color, say, might feel?\n\nThat brings us back to The Guardian, which went even further in twisting a concept intended to increase compassion and empathy to achieve the opposite.\n\nThe occasion was the publication of former British Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s memoirs. Many Americans will be unaware of the conservative politician\u2019s family life. His first child, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. The little boy required intense medical care for his entire life. He died at six.\n\nWhat ordeal could be more harrowing for a parent than watching a child suffer all his life before dying prematurely? Yet The Guardian, a leftwing newspaper, diminished the gravity of this event:\n\nMr. Cameron has known pain and failure in his life, but it has always been limited failure and privileged pain. The miseries of boarding school at seven are entirely real and for some people emotionally crippling but they come with an assurance that only important people can suffer that way. Even his experience of the NHS, which looked after his severely disabled son, has been that of the better functioning and better funded parts of the system.\n\nThat no parent of a dead child would be comforted at all by this \u201cprivilege\u201d clarifies the editorial\u2019s absurdity.\n\nTo its credit, the newspaper quickly apologized and amended the editorial. Its editors are usually more careful, and I do not write to pile on. But it\u2019s worth considering what led to the error, so that others might avoid repeating it.\n\nThe Guardian editorial illustrates how the privilege framework, or rather its perversion, can cause people to lose sight of their shared humanity. Suffering and grief are universal\u2013\u2013and that awful burden can unite us. But like any framework that divides people into different categories, especially along fraught lines like race, gender, ideology, and class, the concept of privilege is vulnerable to tribal power-seeking and othering. Sadism and cruelty inevitably follow.\n\nThose who invoke the privilege framework need not abandon it entirely due to such abuses, but they should better understand its perils and how to guard against them.", "description": "The Guardian twisted the social-justice concept to diminish David Cameron\u2019s grief.", "authors": ["Conor Friedersdorf", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTSHRL8/facebook.jpg?1568668393", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
