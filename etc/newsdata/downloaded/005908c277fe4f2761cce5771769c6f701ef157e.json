After a quick hug, Lyles stuck the baton out and Coleman grabbed hold, too.\n\nNobody was letting it go.\n\nMotivated by a team meeting in the morning, then propelled by sticky-fingered flawlessness at night, the American men overcame the country\u2019s longest and most-notorious track jinx to win gold at the world championships Saturday in the 4\u00d7100 relay that has bedeviled this team for decades.\n\n\u201cWe broke the curse. We broke the curse,\u201d Lyles yelled into the microphone during his on-track interview. \u201cU-S-A. We\u2019re taking all the golds! All of them.\u201d\n\nTheir first sprint relay win at worlds since 2007 \u2014 the pre-Usain Bolt days \u2014 made the U.S. men 3 for 3 in the sprints. The winning started a week ago with Coleman\u2019s romp in the 100, and continued Tuesday with an equally impressive win from Lyles in the 200.\n\nThen, this: A win that was anything but pre-ordained, despite the clear advantage the Americans held in raw speed.\n\nIt takes teamwork, too.\n\nThree times, the Americans passed the baton \u2014 from Coleman to Justin Gatlin, from Gatlin to Mike Rodgers, and from Rodgers to Lyles \u2014 and with nary a hiccup in any of the exchanges. The clean exchanges allowed that raw speed to take over.\n\nStill pumped more than an hour after the race, Lyles provided his own play-by-play.\n\n\u201cI saw the first handoff and I was, like \u2018Dang,\u2019 then I saw the next one and it was, \u2018Dang,\u2019 then, I\u2019m like \u2018Ooh,'\u201d he said. \u201cThen I got the baton and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve got to run fast.\u2019 They\u2019re over there doing magic and I\u2019m just trying to make it all worthwhile.\u201d\n\nIt put an exclamation point on a night that had its share of good and bad for the U.S.\n\nGood: Joe Kovacs pulling an upset over his teammate, Ryan Crouser, for a 1-2 U.S. finish in the shot put.\n\nBad: A false start by Olympic champion Brianna McNeal in the 100-meter hurdle heats \u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t false start,\u201d she insisted to the judges before leaving the track (but she did). And Brittney Reese\u2019s surprisingly early exit from the long jump, meaning she won\u2019t be in the final to defend her title Sunday.\n\nIncluding the women\u2019s relay bronze medal in a race won going away by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Jamaica, the United States heads into the final day with 11 gold medals, and 25 overall. It will be a stretch to match the record total of 30 from two years ago in London.\n\nOther gold medals went to Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela in the triple jump and Kenya\u2019s Hellen Obiri in the women\u2019s 5,000 meters.\n\nObiri held off a charge from eventual bronze medalist Konstanze Klosterhalfen, whose coach is Pete Julian, an assistant at the Nike Oregon Project \u2014 the team run by Alberto Salazar, the famed long-distance guru who was kicked out of the meet last week after receiving a doping ban.\n\nSifan Hassan, who was a Salazar athlete, became the first person to complete a 1,500-10K double at worlds, running the shorter race Saturday in 3 minutes, 51.95 seconds to demolish a top 10 that included six other athletes who set personal bests.\n\nThe result brought with it some immediate trolling on social media.\n\n\u201cThat was the best women\u2019s championship field in history. And one person dominated,\u201d tweeted Steve Magness , the former assistant of Salazar\u2019s who was one of the key whistleblowers in the doping case.\n\nHassan wasn\u2019t in the mood for apologies.\n\n\u201cIf they want to test me, they can test me every single day,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in clean sport. I believe in Alberto. Since I\u2019ve been with him, I\u2019ve worked really hard, and that\u2019s what I know.\u201d\n\nThe harshest of the doping sticklers will be quick to point out that Gatlin (two bans), Rodgers (nine-month ban in 2012) and Coleman (convoluted whereabouts case dismissed last month) also have some baggage in that area.\n\nBut their win Saturday had more to do with a different kind of history.\n\nThe U.S. string of relay nightmares dates back to 1995, before Coleman or Lyles were born, and has also included the last three Olympics. Over the 18 world and Olympic relays held during stretch, the U.S. has dropped the baton or failed to finish nine times.\n\nPart could be attributed to the stress of competing against Bolt, who is now long gone from this sport. But in a sign of how long this spell has existed, this marked the first relay gold for Gatlin, who is 37 and has been racing at this level since 2004 \u2014 four years before Bolt started making his imprint.\n\n\u201cWe had been just right outside the window, just barely not getting the job done,\u201d Gatlin said. \u201cAt some point, I felt like maybe it was me.\u201d\n\nGatlin said it might have helped to start way out on Lane 8 \u2014 a position assigned to the U.S. after a third-place finish in the previous evening\u2019s preliminary heat that, itself, was marred by a near-disaster in the exchange between Rodgers and Cravon Gillespie, who was not in Saturday\u2019s lineup.\n\nThat led Coleman to call a team meeting \u2014 no managers, no coaches, just runners.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to have open dialogue so we could come together and get the job done,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cEveryone talked about what they could do better.\u201d\n\nAnd with that curse now set aside, the future is looking bright.\n\nThe Olympics are less than 10 months away, and the Americans were taking questions about whether the Bolt-led world record of 36.84 seconds from 2012 could be up for grabs in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cSure looks like it now,\u201d Lyles said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "DOHA, Qatar (AP) \u2014 Noah Lyles let out a huge scream and kept right on running \u2014 through the finish line and straight toward his teammate, Christian", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/05/aa5549_aptopix-qatar-athletics-worlds-47881-noah-lyles-united-states-crosses-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
