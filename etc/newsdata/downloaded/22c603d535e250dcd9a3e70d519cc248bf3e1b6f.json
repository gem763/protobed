(PCG) are trading lower in Thursday's market, continuing a trend which began after the bell Wednesday, after a judge opened the door to a rival's chapter 11 plan for the embattled company.\n\nAt 1:08 p.m. ET, shares of the company were trading 28.69% lower at $7.83. Volume was very heavy, with over 31.6 million shares trading, above the company's 65-day average volume of some 9 million.\n\nYear to date, shares have lost over 67%.\n\nOn Wednesday, Judge Dennis Montali of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco stripped PG&E of the sole right to propose a chapter 11 plan, clearing the way for a rival chapter 11 plan from Elliott Management and other bondholders.\n\nPG&E is also dealing with the impact of having to cut power to around 800,000 businesses and households in Northern California as it tries to reduce the threat of wildfires.\n\n--Write to Stephen Nakrosis at stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 10, 2019 13:31 ET (17:31 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
