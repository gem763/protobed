It claims to match or exceed private and public cloud performance for lower operating costs.\n\nOracle has been testing the technology in-house but has not said anything about their performance.\n\nARM's biggest challenge in the data center is that it lacks the software development tools and engineering talent that is available for Intel architecture microprocessors which makes the development of data center business applications more expensive. This can offset computing efficiency gains.\n\nOracle already has a huge presence in nearly every major data center as a vendor with a large catalog of products and services. It has managed to acquire most of the largest enterprise software companies and also Sun Microsystems, a large hardware company. It owns Sun's Sparc microprocessor architecture which is designed for data centers. But ARM has larger library of chip capabilities that can be custom built for higher computing efficiencies.\n\nRenee James has more than 28 years experience at Intel and ran its software groups which will be useful for Ampere's business strategy.", "description": "Oracle already owns much of the data center software and hardware markets and now it is eyeing processors -- Intel's most lucrative business.", "authors": ["Tom Foremski"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/30/f4a0c85d-3a0d-45ea-8697-359ec3fcc355/thumbnail/770x578/83ccc2ad233567b046b5260f8229c442/renee-james.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
