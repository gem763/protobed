They need help with gun control. They need help with keeping these weapons out of these people\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nHe doubled down in his call for gun control when he told ABC News, \u201cIf the state and federal government don\u2019t want to stand up to the NRA and other folks, let us police ourselves. Our officers deserve to be protected and don\u2019t deserve to be shot at by a guy for hours with an unlimited amount of weapons and bullets. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nWe agree. It is disgusting. No convicted felon including Maurice Hill, who has been sent to prison at least a dozen times for crimes including illegal possession of a firearm and assault, should ever have the ability to get their hands on a firearm. No police officer should be in a position where their life is in danger by such a dangerous criminal. No citizen should be left defenseless against that same criminal while they\u2019re waiting on police.\n\nMost of all, no city should be left helpless by an elected official who would grandstand even when faced with stark evidence of the effects of their unwillingness to enforce existing laws.\n\nMayor Kenney was rebuked by Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, in a response to the National Review. \u201cHill is a threat to everyone around him not because he may or may not be an NRA member but because he has embarked on a life of crime. That is what the problem is.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a failure of lacking laws. It\u2019s a failure of executive leadership willing to enforce those laws. Hill was sentenced for his crimes and he even served time for illegal possession of guns. Hill\u2019s convictions on assault, drug charges, illegal weapons possession, escaping, fleeing from police, and resisting arrest, along with prison sentences barred him from legally possessing a firearm. That\u2019s not to mention his charges that didn\u2019t stick, including kidnapping and attempted murder.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Hill. He and his high-profile crimes of shooting police are indicative of a larger problem in Philadelphia. The City of Brotherly Love\u2019s homicide rate is the highest in a decade, even as nationally, it trends down. Hill\u2019s repeated illegal possession of firearms and attempted murder and wounding of police speaks to what we\u2019ve been saying. Criminals aren\u2019t getting their firearms through legal means. They are obtaining them through theft and the black market.\n\nMayor Kenney wants to blame guns for Hill\u2019s crimes. He\u2019s not alone. Just days later, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order for state police and other agencies to report back to him in six months with recommendations to reduce crimes committed with firearms.\n\nHere are our recommendations: Enforce your laws; place the blame from crimes committed with guns on those who commit the crimes; and put criminals in jail. Mayor, fulfill your oath and live up to your responsibilities.\n\nThe firearms industry is committed to Real Solutions for Safer CommunitiesSM. The first step in making our towns and cities safer is holding criminals accountable. If elected leaders won\u2019t do that, they should be held to account for failing in their duties.\n\nLawrence Keane is the Senior Vice President for Government Relations and Public Affairs and General Counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association.", "description": "Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney immediately called for increased gun control .09/02/2019 3:23:21AM EST.", "authors": ["Lawrence Keane", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/227/30a2084b-3c6d-4844-925b-fe59d8845cfc.png"}
