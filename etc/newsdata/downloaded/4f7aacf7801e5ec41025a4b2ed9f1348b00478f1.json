Oakland immediately responded with a drive from their own 25 down to the Packers\u2019 2-yard line, where the game changed in an instant.\n\nOn second-and-goal from the two, Oakland quarterback Derek Carr bootlegged to his right. As he stretched the play toward the Packers sideline he elected not to throw the ball away and instead tried to beat Packers linebacker Blake Martinez to the edge.\n\n\u201cThat was one of those plays that I wanted to make for the team,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nOakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr (4) fumbles the ball while trying to score a touchdown during the second quarter of their game Sunday, October 20, 2019 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. The Packers recovered the ball. The Green Bay Packers beat the Oakland Raiders 42-24.

But Martinez\u2019s hard shove to the back helped the ball squirt out of Carr\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s out.\u201d And they were like \u2018Blake hold on! hold on!\u2019\u201d Martinez said.\n\nInitially, Carr was ruled out of bounds, and the Raiders were to retain possession at the 1.\n\n\u201cI thought it was (out of the end zone) when I saw it live but I wasn\u2019t 100%,\u201d Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 It was a bang-bang type deal right there close to the end zone. Yeah, you talk about a pivotal point in the game.\u201d\n\nWith the play happening under two minutes, it was automatically reviewed. It became clear Carr did indeed lose the ball before he went out of bounds and lost the ball through the end zone.\n\nThe Packers were given the ball back at their own 20 with 1:49 to go. Seven plays and one Raiders penalty later, Aaron Rodgers hit Jake Kumerow for a 37-yard touchdown. Suddenly, a tough one-possession slugfest turned into a 21-10 Packers lead. They then added another score to start the second half at 28-10, and the rout was on.\n\n\u201cEveryone was patting me on the side of the head on the sideline like, \u2018you\u2019re just trying to make a play,\u2019 and I understand,\u201d Carr said. \u201cBecause the ending of it is a fumble, it\u2019s their ball, like that sucks. But in that moment, it\u2019s so hard because you\u2019re like right there, and you\u2019re playing a tough team where you\u2019re going to need all of the points you can get. It\u2019s so hard not to try. That\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever been about in my entire life, is to try. I\u2019ve got to go with two hands, right? Trying to extend with one hand isn\u2019t smart. That\u2019s stupid. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s really hard to, in that situation, while you\u2019re running, like I\u2019m not thinking about anything else but, \u2018oh, man, I could get in.\u2019 But it sucks, man. It\u2019s my fault. I let my team down on that.\u201d", "description": "Derek Carr's fumble into the end zone and subsequent touchback proved to be a critical point in the Packers' eventual rout of the Raiders.", "authors": ["Tom Silverstein", "Ryan Wood", "Jim Owczarski", "Published P.M.
