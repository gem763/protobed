But some top-tier candidates appear to be finding a creative way to tap unpaid talent: offering vague \u201cfellowship\u201d opportunities as volunteer positions.\n\nThere\u2019s no singular definition for a \u201cfellow\u201d among 2020 candidates and most this cycle don\u2019t offer the option. But two leading contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), give applicants who are selected a chance to participate in the campaign as volunteer fellows, without requiring compensation or academic credit.\n\n\u201cVolunteers are asked to do something, workers are told,\u201d Ren\u00e9e Hagerty, an executive council member for the Campaign Workers Guild, said. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s performing work on a campaign should be paid.\u201d\n\nFor Biden\u2019s campaign, the \u201cTeam Joe Organizing Fellowship\u201d consists of an eight-week program that includes weekly online trainings in grassroots and digital organizing, according to the listing, which closed this week. Unlike the internship program, which is paid $15 per hour, the fellowship program makes no mention of wages, academic credit, or time commitments.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign features one joint application with three options: paid internship, volunteer fellowship, or volunteer fellowship for academic credit. Applicants are allowed to select more than one when applying.\n\nWarren\u2019s deputy communications director Chris Hayden told The Daily Beast their internship program \u201coffers a limited number of paid, full-time campaign experiences on a competitive basis\u201d and that \u201cinterns commit to working 30 hours a week, and have access to paid health insurance in addition to their weekly salary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe campaign also offers a volunteer fellowship program, which provides similar training and work experiences with a smaller time commitment,\u201d Hayden added. \u201cMany of our campaign fellows receive stipends from educational institutions or other third-parties, and everyone in our intern and fellowship programs has access to cost-free supporter housing while they\u2019re working in-state.\u201d\n\nStill, Guillermo Creamer, co-founder of the non-profit group Pay Our Interns, said there\u2019s a \u201cgray area\u201d that emerges from having both paid and unpaid options, creating a \u201cfine line\u201d between the roles.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that some campaigns can still think about having both,\u201d Creamer said. \u201cThe question now is: is fellowship the scapegoat for not paying individuals?\u201d\n\nMultiple activists who spoke to The Daily Beast declined to call out individual campaigns, saying they\u2019re generally pleased with the progress this cycle on the paid internship front, what some see as the first hurdle to overcome. But the separate volunteer fellowship option has led several activists to question the program\u2019s cost-benefit analysis.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s actually the difference?\u201d Creamer said when asked about paid internships versus unpaid fellowships. \u201cCampaigns have to be the ones who identify that.\u201d\n\nComing off the heels of a strong second quarter of fundraising, Biden and Warren each crystallized their spots in the top of the Democratic pack both in polls and in money raised. Biden brought in $21.5 million, while Warren reported $19.1 million. The large sums are even stronger reasons to pay fellows for work, rather than doling out fancy titles in exchange, some activists pointed out.\n\n\u201cAt Biden for President, interns are employees who are paid by the hour (capped at 30 hours a week),\u201d a campaign spokesperson wrote in an email. \u201cWhereas fellows are part of an educational experience which we hope will equip them to be effective organizers in the future, and are not employees of the campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cBosses have been coming up with reasons and excuses and caveats for not paying people since the dawn of time,\u201d Hagerty said, without commenting on any campaign specifically. \u201cThis is another version that fits into a middle-class narrative of prestige.\u201d\n\nLegally, there\u2019s no definition in the campaign finance world that would distinguish internships from fellowships, an official from the Campaign Legal Center said. \u201cCampaigns are given pretty broad leeway for how they spend their money. They can provide any title they want,\u201d the official added.\n\nIn a field of nearly two dozen contenders, other candidates offer several different fellowship models. Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) offer paid fellowships, while Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) requires unpaid fellows to receive academic credit in order to participate in the program. The majority of other candidates offer paid internships.\n\nWhile some activists view the practice as a delicate balance between opening a door to those who seek the experience and a loophole for campaigns to use free labor, not everyone agrees the practice is problematic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s utilitarian reasons for campaigns and there\u2019s utilitarian reasons for the workforce,\u201d Janice Fine, an assistant professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University, said. For some, fellowships can be a vital way to gain experience with a specific candidate or area of expertise, without having to commit to a set number of hours or responsibilities, she added.\n\n\u201cA lot of these jobs are just for the experience,\u201d Alan Seals, a labor economist and professor of economics at Auburn University, agreed. \u201cThe worst thing [campaigns] can do is say \u2018no they\u2019re all employees now and you\u2019ve got to pay them minimum wage.\u2019 It would be an absolute disaster.\u201d\n\nBut that argument is what some activists say is part of the problem, and that there needs to be a clear pay-for-work metric that mirrors the fair wage platforms campaigns are pushing on the trail.\n\n\u201cIt smacks of hypocrisy,\u201d Hagerty said. \u201cNo candidate wants to be a hypocrite.\u201d\n\nUpdated to include comment from the Biden campaign.", "description": "The difference between a \u201cfellowship\u201d and an \u201cinternship\u201d in the Warren and Biden campaigns appears to be pay.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1562891005/ew_gve8pf", "published_at": "2019-07-12"}
