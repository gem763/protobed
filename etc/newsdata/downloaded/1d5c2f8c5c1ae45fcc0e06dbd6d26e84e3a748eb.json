Ralph Abraham and self-funding businessman Eddie Rispone, are competing for second place and a one-on-one shot at Edwards in a runoff if the incumbent comes up short of the 50 percent threshold. Republicans believe they will hold Edwards shy of a majority \u2014 and that they would have an advantage over Edwards in a runoff.\n\n\n\nBut in the meanwhile, the two Republicans are attacking one another, jockeying for that second-place slot. In the final week, Rispone launched two new attack ads against Abraham hitting his congressional attendance record and painting him as insufficiently supportive of Trump's 2016 candidacy. Abraham, meanwhile, has been airing an ad telling voters, \"Eddie Rispone has been lying to you.\"\n\n\n\nPrivately, Democrats are hoping that Edwards will win outright. Most public and private polling conducted by allies of the various campaigns has shown Edwards falling just short of the 50 percent he needs to clinch reelection outright. But the party is publicly cautious about the possibility of a runoff and expressing optimism that Edwards can win a head-to-head matchup with one of the Republicans.\n\n\n\n\"It's always hard to avoid a runoff in a multi-candidate race,\" said Democratic strategist Scott Arceneaux, a former executive director of the Louisiana Democratic Party. \"Even with an incumbent. The math is difficult. In Louisiana, you have all these other candidates on the ballot that are going to get between 2 or 3 percent that essentially take up space. It's hard, and I think John Bel has done an excellent job of keeping us in a position where he can certainly get there on Saturday. It's one where he's definitely in the game, and I think it's where he could go 51 [percent] or 49.\"\n\nIn their effort to keep Edwards under 50 percent, Republicans have focused their attacks on Edwards' handling of a sexual harassment complaint directed at his former deputy chief of staff, Johnny Anderson. Both the Republican Governors Association and a Republican-funded outside group, Truth in Politics, have aired ads criticizing Edwards for hiring Anderson, who had been accused of harassment in a previous job, and not moving swiftly enough to oust him.\n\nIn response, the Edwards campaign recently released its own ad featuring women, speaking directly into the camera, defending Edwards' record on women.\n\nRepublicans say the late push \u2014 including visits from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 has momentum on the GOP's side.\n\n\"We're definitely looking at a runoff from our end,\" said Andrew Bautsch, the executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party. \"And that puts the governor in a bad spot from our end because if you look at it, an incumbent has never won going into a runoff in the state of Louisiana.\"\n\nIn fact, Bautsch predicted that, despite polling showing Edwards nearing a majority, he will come up well short. \"We think he's going to be way under the 50 percent mark,\" Bautsch said. \"As of right now our goal is to rally our troops, which we're doing with the president coming in, which we've done all week with the various rallies.\"\n\nEdwards, an anti-abortion Democrat who has avoided associating too closely with the national Democratic Party, has spent competitively in the race. His campaign has spent over $8 million on advertising, while Gumbo PAC, an allied super PAC, has spent nearly $6 million against the two Republicans.\n\nMeanwhile, Rispone has contributed more than $11 million of his own money to his campaign. That has given him a massive advantage on the airwaves over Abraham, spending about $8 million on advertising, compared with Abraham's nearly $2 million. RGA Right Direction PAC, the RGA-aligned affiliate in the state, has spent $4.5 million to keep Republicans on the offensive against Edwards.\n\nRepublicans are buoyed by encouraging numbers in early voting, with turnout up among GOP voters and down among black voters, a key bloc for Edwards. James Hartman, a Louisiana-based Republican consultant, predicted that if there is a runoff, the margin between Abraham and Rispone \u2014 who are running close in the polls \u2014 could be very small.\n\n\u201cI think it could be a very tight race for second place. I think it is theoretically possible that the governor wins reelection [Saturday],\u201d Hartman said, pointing out that Edwards has taken pains not to alienate some conservative voters in the state through a strict anti-abortion bill.\n\nAlso complicating the turnout picture on an autumn weekend: football. Friday night's Trump rally comes as high schools take the field across much of the state. Then, on Saturday, Louisiana State is hosting Florida in a prime-time matchup between top-10-ranked teams, and ESPN's block party-style pregame show, \"College GameDay,\" is coming to Baton Rouge on Saturday morning.\n\nArceneaux, the former executive director of the state Democratic Party, said he'll be watching the turnout numbers Saturday night to see if Democrats got their voters out to beat back Republicans' closing barrage.\n\n\"If African American turnout is high \u2014 if the base community is turning out \u2014 then he's got a real shot at [winning outright],\" Arceneaux said. \"That'll be the biggest indicator.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ac/d6/f66f0f0d49aea47bbdcdfa43bb1c/1011-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
