Watt laid the blame on the defense for letting it get away.\n\nHouston led 14-3 at halftime, 21-10 in the third quarter and 28-27 with 37 seconds left, only to let the Saints pull out a dramatic victory on a last-second field goal.\n\nWatson had turned in a memorable performance, and his third touchdown pass gave the Texans a last-minute lead. But Drew Brees completed three straight passes and Wil Lutz drilled a 58-yard kick as time ran out to hand Houston a frustrating 30-28 loss.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s on us,\u201d Watt said of the Texans defense. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that are on us. To hold them to three points in the first half and then give up 27 in the second, that\u2019s just terrible. And for our offense to give us the lead with 40 seconds left, or whatever it was, and not win the game, we\u2019ll take 100 percent of that blame, as we should.\u201d\n\nThe Saints scored touchdowns on their first three possessions of the second half, punted only once after the break and added two field goals in the final minute.\n\nLutz\u2019s winning kick spoiled a huge night from Watson, who ran for a 21-yard touchdown on a fourth-down play and completed 20 of 30 passes for 268 yards. His final two passes were perfect strikes to DeAndre Hopkins for 38 yards and former Saints receiver Kenny Stills on a 37-yard post pattern as the Texans went 75 yards in 13 seconds to take one last late lead.\n\n\u201cAs long as we can keep it within range, we are in every game, and that\u2019s what Deshaun Watson gives us,\u201d Texans coach Bill O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player, he\u2019s competitive, he\u2019s calm and he\u2019s poised. He\u2019s got all that.\u201d\n\nHopkins had eight catches for 111 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nThe Texans also ran for 180 yards, more than the Saints allowed in any game last season. Carlos Hyde, picked up in a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs at the end of August, had 83 yards on 10 carries.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite enough in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cEvery loss is tough,\u201d Watson said. \u201cGetting blown out, losing by 14 or losing on a last-second field goal is very tough. That\u2019s football. You\u2019ve got to give that kicker props. He did a great job for them.\u201d\n\nConverting six consecutive third downs, Houston scored touchdowns on three consecutive drives spanning the end of the first half and the start of the third quarter. The streak ended when Saints safety Marcus Williams intercepted Watson\u2019s lofted pass down the sideline for William Fuller.\n\nThe Texans gave up four sacks on their next two possessions, leading to punts.\n\n\u201cWe have to shore some things up,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThey got us on a couple of blitzes. We did block them at times, but we have to block them more consistently and the ball has to come out a little quicker at times.\u201d\n\nWatt did not want to hear anything about the offense\u2019s shortcomings. Double-teamed constantly, the three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year did not have a tackle or an assist for only the second time in his nine-year NFL career.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating, but that\u2019s something you have to deal with when you\u2019re in the position I\u2019m in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a way to get there, and tonight I didn\u2019t. I take that on me. We\u2019ll feel the emotions of this for 24 hours, then we\u2019ll move on to Jacksonville, but right now it does hurt.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Deshaun Watson and the Houston Texans appeared poised several times to open the season with a victory over the favored New Orleans Saints in the Superdome.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Guerry Smith"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/texans_saints_football_40452_c0-221-5267-3291_s1770x1032.jpg?e8349d15142d5c8eb56802f6a8bce9c8ebb8f75d", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
