Instead the app ruins the quality and doesn\u2019t show the posts to 90 per cent of followers?\u201d\n\nAnother concurred: \u201cI get where y\u2019all coming from but this is not a good idea. People have worked hard to get where they are and to the amount of engagement they have. Taking it away gives everything less value. How would brands know who to sponsor, etc? This will mess up ALOT of businesses! [sic].\u201d\n\nMosseri did not confirm in the interview whether or not Instagram would be permanently rolling out the like count ban, nor did he say if the feature would be trialled in other countries.\n\nHe did, however, discuss how Instagram is implementing new measures to combat some of the negative sides to the platform, such as bullying, but that there is only so much they can do to control what happens on the app.\n\n\u201cI think that we on social media [and those] who work in social media, I\u2019m sure have a part to play in the anxiety and the pressure that people, in particular, young people feel,\" he said.\n\n\u201cI also want to make sure that we are honest about the fact that given our scales, there's going to be some good and there\u2019s going to be some bad that happens on our platform.\u201d", "description": "Adam Mosseri, CEO of Instagram, has said that hiding like counts on the platform could benefit users. \u201cThe big idea is to try and make Instagram feel less pressurised,\u201d the 36-year-old tech boss told NBC News\u2019 Today\u00a0programme.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/15/istock-958159244.jpg"}
