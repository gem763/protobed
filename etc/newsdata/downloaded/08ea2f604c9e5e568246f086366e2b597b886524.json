Sam Esmail has done a pretty decent job of paring down the story to its bare essentials while maintaining its epic scope, but Mr. Robot can still fall into the trap of being reduced to its crazy or stupid reveals. Just last week, Esmail introduced another twist, one that\u2019s supposedly been baked into the show for its entire run, involving a potential secret twin. In other words, it\u2019s rare that the series can pause and effectively tell a grounded story not beholden to outlandish rigmarole that frequently beggars belief.\n\nThankfully, \u201cForbidden,\u201d written by Courtney Looney, features a simple premise and a compelling guest turn, and showcases a few different shades from our bug-eyed protagonist. In short, Elliot must infiltrate the apartment of Olivia Cortez (Dominik Garc\u00eda-Lorido, daughter of Andy Garc\u00eda), the Deus Group\u2019s only U.S. account manager at Cyprus National Bank, in order to access the Group\u2019s financial records. Elliot and Mr. Robot break into the apartment without a hitch, but discover that they need a security fob to access the files, one that she carries on her person. When they find her at a bar where she has been stood up by a date, Elliot immediately wants to use her Oxycontin addiction and her child-custody agreement as blackmail material to get what they need. Mr. Robot has a different idea in mind: Actually converse with Olivia instead of casually destroying another human being.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice reversal of the usual Elliot\u2013Mr. Robot dynamic, in which the latter constantly tries to push the former into more dangerous, destructive territory. Now it\u2019s Elliot, sporting an ice-cold self-destructive streak, who wants to bulldoze his way to Whiterose, and Mr. Robot is the one who tries to pump the breaks. When Elliot approaches Olivia, he tries to intimidate her into staying in the bar, but it mostly comes off as awkward. When Mr. Robot shows up with smooth talk and kind smiles, courtesy of Christian Slater\u2019s natural charm, she stays for another drink, forcing Elliot to actually interact with a kind stranger, even if it\u2019s in service of theft.\n\nMalek and Garc\u00eda-Lorido shine in the awkward first date scene, as they both are unusually forthright about their personal demons while also trying to maintain respectability. It leads to some particularly funny exchanges, like when Elliot explains he\u2019s been off morphine for nine months minus the heroin he did two days ago, or facial reactions, such as Elliot\u2019s befuddled expression when Olivia expresses condolences about his mom\u2019s death. They eventually hook up in rom-com fashion \u2014 he runs after her while waiting for a cab, a lot of harried clothes shedding mid-makeout upon arriving at home \u2014 and Elliot steals the security fob while she\u2019s asleep.\n\nBut then something slightly unexpected happens: Elliot and Olivia actually have an open conversation about their respective mental illnesses. Olivia opens up about how she fell into opioids after her mother\u2019s murder, fracturing her relationship with her father in the process. She keeps a razor blade in an empty Oxycontin bottle to remind herself that if she hates herself enough to start using again, she might as well kill herself. Elliot shares his experiences with suicidal ideation and self-loathing. The writing can be a little blunt-edged and occasionally hoary (\u201cYou know you can\u2019t scare me,\u201d Elliot tells Olivia with gut-wrenching earnestness), but the performances help it avoid clumsiness. Malek and Garc\u00eda-Lorido sell the idea that they\u2019re two broken people approaching the second acts of lives they never thought they\u2019d ever lead. For a brief, honest moment, as a streak of light hits their faces while sitting in the bathroom, they are comfortable and complete.\n\nThe rest of the episode is a decidedly more mixed bag. \u201cForbidden\u201d opens with a 15-minute origin story of Whiterose beginning in the year 1982, where she, in the guise of a young Director Zhang (Ross Kurt Le), negotiates a deal between IBM and the Chinese government alongside Zhang\u2019s translator and lover (Eugene Shaw). Zhang comes out as trans to him that night, and though he accepts it, their love has \u201cdoom\u201d written all over it. On the day of his lover\u2019s wedding, forced upon him by his father, Zhang tells him that he has accepted the position of minister of State Security, effectively collapsing their plans of moving to the states where they can be comfortably out. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll find a way to make this world better, for us,\u201d Zhang tries to tell him.\n\nAt this point, you can see the grisly suicide coming, so when Zhang\u2019s lover cuts his throat with a cheese knife while Zhang screams in horror, it feels almost perfunctory. It\u2019s not just that Mr. Robot is playing into a toxic gay-suicide trope, but also that the storyline, though sensitively handled, feels so riddled with forbidden love clich\u00e9s. Worse, Zhang\u2019s lover goes unnamed the entire time, rendering his death a narrative utility instead of a character moment. While his suicide at least isn\u2019t used to prop up a straight person\u2019s story, it\u2019s not much of an improvement, either.\n\nIn the present day, Whiterose decides to capitulate to Price\u2019s demands, and tells Wang Shu to set up a Deus Group meeting for Christmas Day, where they will name Tyrell Wellick as a successor. Later, Tyrell breaks into Elliot\u2019s apartment to tell him the good news, not knowing that a Dark Army van has been following Elliot since leaving Olivia\u2019s apartment. There are eyes everywhere, whether they are from Whiterose, the Dark Army, or Vera, who\u2019s back in town and hoping to bring Elliot into his drug-dealing fold. Letting people in doesn\u2019t have to hurt, like Mr. Robot says, but when there are too many people around, it can be tough to keep the bad ones out.\n\nOrphan Code\n\n\u2022 Sam Esmail\u2019s pop-culture fetishism might have peaked this week with the vintage The Thing commercial that plays on the hotel TV followed by an \u201980s-era USA Network bumper.\n\n\u2022 It wouldn\u2019t be Mr. Robot without at least a couple clunky lines per episode. This week it\u2019s a tie between Mr. Robot claiming that Elliot keeps \u201cflat-out throwing me a Forbidden Error\u201d and Vera insisting his partner be more detailed because \u201cthe devil is in that shit.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Music corner: Lot of big tracks this week! The video for Culture Club\u2019s \u201cTime (Clock of the Heart)\u201d plays on MTV during the \u201980s flashbacks. Grimes\u2019 \u201cFlesh and Blood\u201d soundtracks Elliot and Olivia\u2019s hookup. Finally, a snippet of Arcade Fire\u2019s \u201cSupersymmetry\u201d plays as Elliot waits for the train after leaving Olivia\u2019s apartment.\n\n\u2022 \u201cHe\u2019s into snowboarding, social-media influencing, and Raki.
