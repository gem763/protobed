As such I will not be drawn on any further detail until formal identification processes approved by Her Majesty\u2019s Coroner have taken place,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier on Friday police arrested two others, named as haulage boss Thomas Maher and his wife Joanna, both 38 and from Warrington in Cheshire, on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter.\n\nThe couple are believed to have been the last known owners of the vehicle, but say they sold it to a company in Ireland just over a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the cab \u2014 my name was down as owning it. We did own it, but sold it 13 months ago,\u201d Ms Maher told the Daily Mail.\n\nThe 25-year-old driver, from Northern Ireland and named as Mo Robinson is still being held on suspicion of murder.\n\nmedia_camera A warrant for further detention of Robinson was granted on Thursday. Picture: Facebook/Mo Robinson\n\nWHO ARE THE OTHER VICTIMS?\n\nAt least six of the 39 victims may have been from Vietnam, according to reports.\n\nThe BBC says it has spoken to several Vietnamese families, including Pham Thi Tra My\u2019s, who worry their relatives were in the trailer.\n\nMeanwhile Essex residents have described the area where the truck container was found as rife with brazen people smuggling operations that police have failed to act on.\n\nGary Lilley, 61, who lives opposite the Purfleet port where a container entered the UK this week that was found to have the bodies of eight women and 31 men sealed inside said he had seen women and children wandering the streets after dark with carrier bags containing their belongings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 30 years and the situation is an absolute joke. I\u2019ve seen literally hundreds of migrants smuggled into the country through the port,\u201d he told The Times.\n\n\u201cI worked there while in between jobs and it was chaos.\u201d\n\nHe said the security checks felt like \u201cusing a plaster to plug a dam\u201d and he was horrified but not surprised to learn that 39 people had died.\n\nMr Lilley said he had found young women walking the street and once offered water to two young girls during a heatwave this summer. The migrants use local phone booths to call people smugglers for collection, he said.\n\n\u201cThe port comes alive around 2am,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve seen groups of migrants walking out the front door of the port with carrier bags. When there\u2019s a group of them a few security guards on minimum wage aren\u2019t going to stop them. They are all ages, babes-in-arms and five-year-old girls.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera A neighbour has described the British port that 39 migrants came through as \u201ccoming alive\u201d at night.\n\nNeighbour Frederick Gurnett, 82, said it has become particularly bad in the last 10 years and he was once asked for shoes by a migrant who had just arrived and approached him in his garden.\n\n\u201cI felt sorry for him but his feet were much bigger than mine so I couldn\u2019t help,\u201d he said.\n\nHis wife, Pauline, 74, estimated there had been \u201chundreds\u201d travelling through the port and it was \u201cextremely sad\u201d to see people carrying there belongings in carrier bags and being moved through a clearly organised system.\n\nSNAKEHEAD GANGS RUN TRADE\n\nIt\u2019s believed \u201csnakehead\u201d Chinese people smuggling gangs could be behind the illegal operation that left 39 people dead this week.\n\nExperts believe the victims could be the latest in a tragic trade that has previously led to the death of 58 Chinese nationals in 2000 as part of a smuggling operation led by a snakehead known as Sister Ping.\n\nPort authorities and police have been accused of failing to act on previous warnings.\n\nThe victims are believed to have been sealed in the refrigerated container, that could have reached -25 degrees, for at least 12 hours. It\u2019s not clear at what point they entered the container.\n\nGPS tracking data shows the container visited migrant hotpots of Calais and Dunkirk in the week before the victims were found, raising the prospect that more people could have been taken to the UK.\n\nEssex Police have confirmed the first 11 victims have been taken to Broomfield Hospital for an identification process to take place.\n\n\u201cThis is all being done in liaison with HM Coroner and we continue to ensure the dignity of the victims is our primary consideration,\u201d Essex police said.\n\nOriginally published as Truck horror: \u2018Naked, foaming at mouth\u2019", "description": "New details have emerged about the horrific end 39 victims faced inside an Essex truck, including bloody handprints and naked bodies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a9f7aa817e939e20e856c98bab575210", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
