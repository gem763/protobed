(Picture: ITV)\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity kicked off with a mix of Love Island supergroups and moving tributes from Martin Bashir, but not everyone was entirely sold on the concept.\n\nIn the first episode of the series, judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, and Nicole Scherzinger were joined by a bunch of celebrity pals as a number of famous faces auditioned at Simon\u2019s Malibu home.\n\nSo who impressed? The Chase\u2019s Jenny Ryan proved the biggest standout, delivering a stunning cover of Queen\u2019s Somebody To Love.\n\nOn the other end of the scale was duo Jeremy Edwards and Brendan Cole, with the former getting particularly bitter toward the judges after some negative comments.\n\nWes Nelson, Eyal Booker, Samira Mighty and Zara McDermott (Picture: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX)\n\nFalling somewhere in the middle were the Love Island supergroup, comprised of Wes Nelson, Eyal Booker, Samira Mighty and Zara McDermott, with the former showing off his surprisingly decent rapping skills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unlikely highlight was Martin Bashir, who provided a touching moment as he revealed how his late brother inspired him to sign up for the show.\n\nBut how did the show go down with viewers? Some fully embraced the lighter, sillier tone.\n\nI\u2019m actually enjoying #XFactor for the first time in years! #XFactorCelebrity \ud83e\udd70 \u2014 Hannah Morgans (@HannahMorganss) October 12, 2019\n\nWell that was exactly what the country needed at this time.
