It would be negative and carping to point out, for example, that 10 minutes to camera in response to questions from members of the public selected by himself or his advisers is not exactly a searching test of democratic accountability.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Or whether \u201ccollaboration\u201d was precisely the best word to use to describe the combination of forces arrayed against a no-deal Brexit in parliament and across the capitals of Europe.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Let us congratulate him on seeking dialogue with the voters. We are not naive enough to call him the unelected prime minister. We understand how our parliamentary democracy works: we elect our MPs and the prime minister is then the person best placed to command the confidence of the House of Commons.\n\nThat probably is Mr Johnson at the moment \u2013 a proposition that may well be tested soon, in any case. It may make sense \u2013 for him at least, given his government\u2019s notional majority of just one \u2013 for him to secure his own direct mandate through a general election, but that is not the priority right now.\n\nIf Mr Johnson really wants to engage with the British people, we have a modest proposal to make. He wants to take Britain out of the EU without a deal. There is no majority for this in the House of Commons and, according to the opinion polls, there is no majority for it among the British people.\n\nThe best way to secure legitimacy for such a disruptive outcome, which is not what people voted for in 2016, is to hold a Final Say referendum. That, and not some gimmicky social media video, would be real democratic engagement.", "description": "We at The Independent are in favour of positivity, optimism and the common ground, so let us praise Boris Johnson for seeking to engage with the people in whose name he now governs.\u00a0 Let us admire the innovative use of a tablet computer on the prime minister\u2019s desk in No 10 as a prop with which to conduct \u201cThe People\u2019s PMQs\u201d by video on Facebook.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/14/13/boris-facebook.jpg"}
