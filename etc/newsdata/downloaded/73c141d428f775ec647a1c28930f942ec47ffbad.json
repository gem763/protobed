The precaution was taken after experts monitoring the massive Planpincieux glacier said they are recording ice movements of up to 50 centimeters (nearly 20 inches) a day. They warned that a 250,000-cubic-meter mass of the 1,327 square kilometer (512 square mile) glacier was at risk of collapsing.\n\n\u201cThere are no models to tell us if it will fall entirely or in pieces,\u201d the mayor told Sky TG24. \u201cWe need to keep an eye on the monitoring.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that even if a large chunk of the glacier collapses, no residents would be at risk, just the area of road that has been closed.\n\nThe glacier is located in the Alps on the Grande Jorasses peak of the Mont Blanc massif, which straddles the borders of Italy, France and Switzerland and contains the highest peak in Western Europe. Officials said unusually high temperatures during August and September had accelerated the ice melt of the Planpincieux, which is has been monitored by the Safe Mountain Foundation since 2013.\n\nItalian Premier Giuseppe Conte alerted world leaders to risk of the glacier\u2019s collapse during his address Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly in New York City.\n\n\u201cIt is an alarm that we cannot be indifferent to,\u201d he said.\n\nCourmayeur was not affected by the mayor\u2019s order and no one has been evacuated, Courmayeur spokesman Moreno Vignolini said Wednesday, adding that the road that was closed is used mostly to access summer homes. The mayor was meeting with residents and homeowners to hear their concerns. Some limited access was being granted for people who needed to check their property.\n\nA new special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said Wednesday that glaciers around the world, outside of Greenland and Antarctica but including Europe, are losing 220 billion metric tons of ice a year. The report said glacier melt is happening faster than before and is accelerating.\n\nThe report projects that if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these glaciers in general will shrink 36% between now and the end of the century. But smaller glaciers, like those in the Alps, could lose up to 80% of their ice by the year 2100 in a worst-case scenario.\n\n\u201cMany glaciers are projected to disappear regardless of future emissions,\u201d the new science report said.\n\nMatthias Huss, a glaciologist at ETH Zurich and head of the group Glacier Monitoring Switzerland, said the loss of glacier ice in Switzerland and Europe over the last five years has been the strongest since measurements began in the 1950s. He noted that the freezing line of 0 degree Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) rose above the top of Mont Blanc this summer, \u201cwhich very rarely has happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have melting at an elevation of almost 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) above sea level, which is really changing the system and can support such events as glaciers falling down,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Switzerland has lost 15% of its glacier volume, with nearly 3% loss in 2017-2018 alone, Huss said. If this trend continues, Switzerland could lose all glaciers by the year 2100 if warming continues. A change in policies could save the bigger ones, he said, but smaller ones will be lost regardless.\n\n\u201cWe hope climate prevention measures are implemented and the warming trend is slowing down,\u201d Huss said. \u201cIf we continue as we did, then there is no rescue for the glaciers in the Alps.\u201d\n\n____\n\nAP Science Writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A fast-moving Italian glacier is melting quickly, threatening a picturesque valley near the Alpine town of Courmayeur and prompting the mayor to close down a mountain road.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Colleen Barry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
