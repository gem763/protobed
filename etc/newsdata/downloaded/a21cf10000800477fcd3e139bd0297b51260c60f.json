Davies said: \"Never say never.\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nDUBLIN \u2014 A fight against Dillon Danis would be \"very embarrassing\" for YouTuber Jake Paul, MMA coach John Kavanagh told Business Insider.\n\nKavanagh trains the former two-weight UFC champion Conor McGregor, the 22-year-old Bellator MMA featherweight James Gallagher, and the Bellator prospect Danis from his new and improved Straight Blast Gym in Dublin.\n\nTalking about a potential MMA match-up between Paul and Danis, he said: \"It would be like me playing with a child.\"\n\nHowever, he's not against the idea because it could make his fighter very, very rich.\n\nDanis and Paul have a wild rivalry\n\nA 26-year-old with a black belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu, Danis is one of the most promising athletes in the Bellator MMA roster.\n\nPaul, meanwhile, has never fought properly before.\n\nThe height of his combat career arrived on the undercard of an unlicensed boxing event at the Manchester Arena in England last year. Paul beat Deji Olatunji by knockout just before his older brother Logan Paul fought to a draw against fellow YouTuber KSI in the main event.\n\nWhile Logan Paul and KSI have a rematch to contest in November, this time as professional boxers at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Danis and Jake Paul have been locked in a war of words on Twitter and could agree their own bizarre bout.\n\nRead more: KSI vs. Logan Paul 2 has only been official for 1 day, and the boxing media is already sick of it\n\nPaul, an internet personality with 20 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, attempted to deride Danis' career by suggesting he hit his peak when he got hit by Khabib Nurmagomedov. The Russian wrestler made Conor McGregor tap in a 2018 fight before jumping out the cage and charging at Danis, who was cageside at the time.\n\nDanis replied by posting a crass comment about Paul's wife, Tana Mongeau.\n\nThe trash-talk has built hype for a prospective fight, with Danis saying on Twitter last week that he had even signed a contract.\n\n\"I signed my contract, waiting on your end Jake Paul. Let's give the people what they want,\" he tweeted on September 26.\n\nIt would be a very embarrassing fight for him, what Dillon could do to him.\n\nIt is unclear who would promote the fight and if it would take place in a Bellator cage. David Green, Bellator's Head of Europe, told Business Insider: \"I'll defer comment on that and leave it to the American matchmakers.\"\n\nBut Kavanagh is keen to see it happen, even if it's without his involvement, as it could mean life-changing money for his fighter.\n\n\"It's not really for me,\" he said. \"I'd just leave them at it. Dillon Danis is so far ahead of Jake Paul. Some people might read this and go, 'Oh well, Conor [McGregor] fought [Floyd] Mayweather and that was a joke.' But it wasn't. It was two very amazing combat sports athletes.\n\n\"Dillon Danis is a professional fighter, an excellent fighter. Jake Paul is a personality. It would be a very embarrassing fight for him, what Dillon could do to him.\"\n\nJohn Kavanagh trains many elite mixed martial artists.

There's no fight whatsoever.\n\n\"But even if it's just boxing \u2026 Dillon's pure athleticism and understanding of fighting, that's all Dillon has done all his life, it's fighting. Jake does funny YouTube videos, oh, and there's a bit of money in boxing. I'm sure he does a few weeks of training, and then he fights. His life is not fighting. Dillon would make the guy look silly.\n\n\"Purely from a friend and a business point of view, I'd love Dillon to get that because, so what, it's a bit of circus but you get a couple million for it.\"\n\nAs far as whether Kavanagh would coach him and work his corner, he said: \"I wouldn't really have anything to do with it, I don't see what part I'd play in that. What would I tell Dillon, you know? Toy with this guy for a round or two? I'd leave him at it, but I'd love to see him get it so he can make a lot of money.\"\n\nDanis has 'embarrassed high-level fighters'\n\nBellator MMA's Head of Europe, David Green. Business Insider / Alan Dawson\n\nGreen, who has worked with Danis at Bellator MMA, said: \"I don't know why Jake Paul would ever want that fight. Dillon Danis has embarrassed high-level fighters.\"\n\nTo see what Danis can do inside a cage, watch his highlights here:\n\nThe Channel 5 MMA presenter Gareth A. Davies, who is also the combat correspondent at the Telegraph and talkSPORT, commented on the gulf in fighting ability between the two men.\n\n\"One is a proper fighter and one isn't. Jake Paul is a YouTuber. I don't buy it. Jake Paul is not a genuine fighter. Dillon Danis is. He's a savant on the ground,\" Davies told Business Insider.\n\nHowever, as far as whether this could be a ficticious fight, he added: \"Never say never, we're in the fight business, baby!\"", "description": "Conor McGregor's coach weighed in on the \"circus\" surrounding his other athlete Dillon Danis after he was linked with a bizarre fight against Jake Paul.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d91f0502e22af40d5637e9b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
