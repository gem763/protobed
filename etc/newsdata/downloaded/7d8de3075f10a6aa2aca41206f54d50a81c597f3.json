(AP) - Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt says freshman quarterback Brian Maurer will remain the starter Saturday when the Volunteers host Mississippi State.\n\nPruitt had said Monday that Maurer \u201cwould really have to have a bad week of practice not to\u201d start the Mississippi State game. Pruitt confirmed Wednesday afternoon that Maurer will start.\n\nMaurer made his first career start last week and went 14 of 28 for 259 yards with two touchdown passes, one interception and a fumble in a 43-14 loss to No. 3 Georgia. Jarrett Guarantano had started 22 of the Volunteers\u2019 last 23 games leading up to the Georgia matchup.\n\nPruitt also said Wednesday that the Vols plan to redshirt receiver Brandon Johnson, enabling the senior to have one more year of eligibility. Johnson had 37 catches in 2017 and 14 more in 2018 but has only two receptions for 31 yards in four games this year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt says freshman quarterback Brian Maurer will remain the starter Saturday when the Volunteers host Mississippi State.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/georgia_tennessee_football_17684_c0-158-3636-2277_s1770x1032.jpg?98ba69c1da68775518cfb8375ca596caf5116810", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
