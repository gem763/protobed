But Justice Doris Gonzalez of the Bronx Supreme Court wrote that Trump\u2019s testimony was necessary, rejecting a request by his legal team that she quash a subpoena. The trial is scheduled to start on Sept. 26.\n\n\u201cMore than 200 years ago our founders sought to escape an oppressive, tyrannical governance in which absolute power vested with a monarch,\u201d Gonzalez wrote. \u201cA fear of the recurrence of tyranny birthed our three-branch government adorned with checks and balances.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo government official, including the executive, is above the law,\u201d she added.\n\nThe dispute centers on a protest in September 2015 in front of Trump Tower in Manhattan, during Trump\u2019s first presidential campaign. Five plaintiffs in the lawsuit were protesting in front of the building. Two were dressed in attire mimicking Ku Klux Klan robes. Others carried large campaign-style signs saying, \u201cMake America Racist Again.\u201d\n\nIn an ensuing confrontation, some parts of which were captured in videos, Trump\u2019s private security detail inaccurately told the protesters that the sidewalk in front of Trump Tower was private property and tried to force them to move away from it.\n\nTrump\u2019s security director at the time, Keith Schiller, who later had a stint in the White House as an aide to Trump, ripped away two of the large protest signs and tried to carry them into the building. When one of the protesters, Efrain Galicia, pursued him and grabbed one of the signs, Schiller struck him in the head, video shows.\n\nGonzalez noted that the Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that presidents did not have temporary immunity for acts that were done before taking office and were not related to their official duties. In that matter, a federal lawsuit by Paula Jones against President Bill Clinton, Clinton ultimately submitted to a deposition, but the case never went to trial.\n\nFriday\u2019s ruling also pointed to one from a New York appeals court in March that rejected a claim by Trump\u2019s legal team that, as president, he was immune from state lawsuits under the Constitution. That ruling has permitted a defamation suit \u2014 from a former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d whom Trump called a liar after she accused him of groping her \u2014 to proceed.\n\nThe legal team representing Trump and the Trump Organization in the protest case may appeal Friday\u2019s ruling, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Roger Bernstein, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, praised the decision, saying it was \u201cclearly correct\u201d and that Trump\u2019s \u201ctestimony will be highly relevant to the trial.\u201d\n\nWalter Dellinger, who served as acting solicitor general in 1997 and unsuccessfully urged the Supreme Court to delay Jones\u2019 lawsuit until after Clinton was no longer president, said the trial judge would need to accommodate Trump\u2019s schedule. That could mean booking his testimony during a weekend when the president would otherwise be playing golf and being open to rescheduling it if there is a crisis, he said.\n\nBut, Dellinger, a law professor at Duke University, said the chances were good that Trump would end up having to submit to videotaped questioning.\n\n\u201cUnless the Supreme Court were to abandon its unanimous decision in Clinton against Jones,\u201d he said, \u201cthe president\u2019s testimony should be forthcoming.\u201d\n\nWhile rare, there are other examples of a sitting president testifying for a trial. For example, President Gerald Ford gave a videotaped deposition in the criminal trial of Lynette Fromme, who had tried to assassinate him. But it is not clear whether there are any prior historical examples of a president testifying involuntarily for a state trial.\n\nDuring an earlier stage in the pretrial proceedings in the Trump Tower protest lawsuit, another judge rejected a request by the plaintiffs to depose Trump, and his legal team had asked Gonzalez to similarly quash a subpoena for the president\u2019s testimony at the trial.", "description": "NEW YORK -- A Bronx trial judge on Friday ordered President Donald Trump to provide videotaped testimony for an upcoming trial over a lawsuit brought by protesters who say that his private security guards assaulted them on a public sidewalk in front of Trump Tower and stole a protest sign.The ruling", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AJl2.EYcl_beD0kFd73pjA--~B/aD0zMzI1O3c9NDk4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d4152c10-dbbd-11e9-b3ef-48ec2f4c0e0d", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
