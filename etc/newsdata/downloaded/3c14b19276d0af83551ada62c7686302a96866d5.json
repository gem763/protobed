The guy had girlfriends and had a legitimate marriage to Lisa Marie [Presley], that was the way he lived his life.\n\n\u201cWe were the people sneaking the girls into his room.\u201d\n\nMichael Jackson, shielded from the rain by bodyguard Matt Fiddes, attends a fundraising event at Exeter Football Club in 2002.

He had to be in Los Angeles to conduct business, it\u2019s about four hours\u2019 drive from the mountains and he hated the drive, so he was very rarely there.\n\nFiddes addressed the claims made in the Leaving Neverland documentary (Photo: Taylor Jewell/Invision/AP) More\n\n\u201cHe was there to make public appearances. He was much more comfortable at the Beverly Wiltshire in a suite.\u201d\n\nShedding light on Jackson\u2019s hectic schedule amid the time the incidents allegedly took place, Fiddes added: \u201cIf he was doing what he was doing to young kids he would never get any work done.\n\n\u201cHe was already recording, performing and rehearsing, for him to be messing around with young kids would be impossible because of the security that was in place.
