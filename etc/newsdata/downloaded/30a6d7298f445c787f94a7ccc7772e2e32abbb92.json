Both of us did a huge amount of deep dive research ... and then we made a whole bunch of stuff up too,\u201d Michod said.\n\n\u201cAnd the upshot of it is that I sit here now before you today and I honestly can\u2019t remember what\u2019s real, what\u2019s made up and what\u2019s from Shakespeare.\u201d\n\nMUD\n\nLily-Rose Depp, who plays the daughter of France\u2019s King Charles, Catherine, said the movie spoke about \u201chow different people harness power differently\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a time period in which women were given almost no power... and no choice over their own lives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe way in which my character harnesses her power in a very calm way but with a lot of conviction and a lot of strength is a really nice message to send especially at this time.\u201d\n\nEdgerton said the battle scene was shot over two weeks in a muddy field in Hungary.\n\n\u201cOne day ... at the end of the take, I realized I had literally mud over my entire face and for some reason it just made me really happy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 76th Venice Film Festival - Film \"The King\" out of competition - Arrivals - Venice, Italy, September 2, 2019 - Timothee Chalamet gestures as he arrives.
