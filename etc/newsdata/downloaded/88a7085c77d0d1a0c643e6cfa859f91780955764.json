Even so, the House seeks to kill the request after the Trump administration announced last month it would not defend the CFPB\u2019s structure before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cBy not defending the Consumer Bureau\u2019s independence, the Trump Administration is choosing special interests over America\u2019s consumers,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiEx-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown Former George W.

Circuit ruling to protect the CFPB, arguing that the president has ample authority to fire the bureau\u2019s director if she or he is not enforcing the law.\n\nThe brief also noted that because the CFPB is controlled by a single director, the president wields significant power over the agency by choosing who leads it.\n\n\u201cIndeed, where an agency is headed by a single individual, the lines of Executive accountability\u2014and Presidential control\u2014are even more direct than in a multi-member agency,\u201d the House argued.\n\n\u201cIf the President determines that the CFPB Director is failing in her duty to enforce the consumer protection laws, the President can remove and replace the Director.\u201d\n\nThe CFPB issued several sweeping regulations and pursued aggressive lawsuits under former director Richard Cordray Richard Adams CordrayTrump administration asks Supreme Court to take up challenge to consumer bureau Watchdog agency must pick a side: Consumers or scammers Kraninger's CFPB gives consumers the tools to help themselves MORE, a Democrat.
