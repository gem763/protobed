The rookie sealed the first win of the season for the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\nThe 20-year-old Texier\u2019s snap shot past Linus Ullmark 2:08 into overtime lifted Columbus to a 4-3 win over Buffalo on Monday night. It also gave the Blue Jackets a much-needed shot of confidence after losing their first two games by a combined score of 10-3.\n\n\u201c(Foligno) came out with the puck - he did a great job,\u201d Texier said. \u201cI was alone in the middle.\u201d\n\nAfter going up 2-0 in the first period, Columbus let the Sabres climb back in. With the Blue Jackets leading 3-2 late, Buffalo pulled its goalie on a power play to create a 6-on-4 advantage and got a goal from Victor Olofsson to tie the score.\n\nThat set the stage for Texier\u2019s heroics.\n\n\u201cWell deserved,\u201d Columbus coach John Tortorella said. \u201cHe was probably our best forward, our most consistent forward tonight.\u201d\n\nFoligno, Oliver Bjorkstrand and Cam Atkinson also scored for the Blue Jackets, who outshot Buffalo 44-18. Joonas Korpisalo had 15 saves.\n\nMarcus Johansson and Jeff Skinner added goals for Buffalo, and Ullmark, making his first start of the season, had 40 saves.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got recharge, be a little bit sour about the loss today,\u201d Ullmark said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a new day tomorrow. There\u2019s nothing else to it.\u201d\n\nIt was the first loss for Buffalo.\n\n\u201cAfter a couple of games where everything went our way, we struggled to find our game, especially in the first period,\u201d coach Ralph Krueger said. \u201cLinus gave us a chance. We still showed character tonight to come back from two down, thanks to Linus buying us some time.\u201d\n\nBjorkstrand, playing in his 200th NHL game, got his first goal of the season with 1:51 left in the first when he grabbed a carom off the back boards and shot from a sharp angle, bouncing the puck in off Ullmark\u2019s back.\n\nThe Blue Jackets struck again quickly when Atkinson - just 9 seconds into a power play - scored from the bottom of the right circle off a sharp behind-the-net feed from Alexander Wennberg.\n\nEarly in the second period, it was Buffalo\u2019s turn to capitalize on a power play. Johansson, signed as an unrestricted free agent in the summer, got his first goal with the Sabres on a one-timer from the right circle to cut Columbus\u2018 lead to 2-1.\n\nSkinner tied the score for Buffalo later in the second when he picked Ryan Murray\u2019s pocket in the defensive zone on the Blue Jackets\u2019 transition and rifled a shot past Korpisalo from 30 feet.\n\n\u201cThe second period showed fight and the willingness to try to fix a night that\u2019s difficult and get used to playing some close games, because we\u2019re going to have a lot this year,\u201d Krueger said.\n\nFoligno batted in a bouncing puck amid heavy traffic to give Columbus the lead again on a power play 6:46 into the third and then had the helper in OT.\n\n\u201cTo win it this way,\u201d Tortorella said, \u201cI think it gives you some juice.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Columbus F Sonny Milano replaced Josh Anderson, who was injured Saturday in a 7-2 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins. \u2026 Blue Jackets D Markus Nutivaara replaced Dean Kukan after being a healthy scratch Saturday. \u2026 Columbus rookie F Emil Bemstrom got his first NHL point with an assist on Foligno\u2019s goal.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSabres: Host Montreal on Wednesday night.\n\nBlue Jackets: Host Anaheim on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With the game tied 3-3 in overtime, Nick Foligno stole the puck from Buffalo's Jack Eichel at the back boards and passed out to Alexandre Texier skating free through the right circle.
