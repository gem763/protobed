Indexing capital gains means investors could adjust their cost basis for inflation \u2013 so only gains that exceed the rate of inflation would be taxed.\n\nProponents argue that inflation erodes the value of an investment over time, so a portion of what is taxed is not a \u201creal return.\u201d\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by President Trump in 2017, one of the most significant overhauls of the U.S. tax code in decades.", "description": "Details will be released within the coming year.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Trump-Rally-NC-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
