In this regard, the company closed the buyout of Tulip Limited from Danish Crown, which was announced in August. Funded with cash, Tulip Limited was valued at \u00a3290 million. With this acquisition, Tulip Limited will form a separate business segment under Pilgrim\u2019s Pride.\n\n\n\nThe inclusion of Tulip Limited is likely to solidify Pilgrim\u2019s Pride\u2019s geographic presence and enhance its position in the pork market in the U.K. Markedly, Tulip Limited is one of the biggest pig producers in the U.K. The company, with annual sales of roughly \u00a31 billion, offers an array of supreme quality, innovative products to foodservice and retail consumers.\n\n\n\nPer the deal, Danish Crown will keep providing Danish pork to Tulip Limited (as part of a long-term supply contract). This, in turn, will enable Tulip Limited to continue offering best quality products from European producers. Thus, Tulip Limited\u2019s addition is expected to fortify Pilgrim\u2019s Pride\u2019s European business and expand its global reach.\n\n\n\nPilgrim\u2019s Pride\u2019s Growth Efforts in Place\n\n\n\nWell, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride has been pursuing buyouts and making efforts to expand offerings and strengthen the business. The acquisition of branded chicken products provider, GNP Company, is expected to keep bolstering driving Pilgrim\u2019s Pride\u2019s sales in the upcoming quarters. Additionally, the Moy Park acquisition (poultry and prepared foods provider) is beneficial for Pilgrim\u2019s Pride\u2019s European business.\n\nThis apart, Pilgrim's Pride consistently strives to improve portfolio and competitive position through innovation. In this respect, the company has been expanding in the fresh food offerings space. In fact, the launch of fresh chicken products under the premium Pilgrim's brand has been receiving favorable consumer response. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is on track to expand in the gluten-free products category.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect such efforts to continue fueling the stock that has surged 68.4% in a year\u2019s time, comfortably outpacing the industry\u2019s growth of 20.3%.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t Miss These Solid Food Stocks\n\n\n\nTreeHouse Foods THS, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 13.8%.
