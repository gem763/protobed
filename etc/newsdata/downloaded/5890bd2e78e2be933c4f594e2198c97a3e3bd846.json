But it would likely look at whether Giuliani\u2019s relationships with foreign politicos interfered or intersected with American foreign-policy efforts.\n\nAsked about the prospect of lawmakers investigating his foreign work, President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer had a defiant response: Bring it on.\n\n\u201cIf they want to come after me, I gladly accept it, because we could just make the Biden stuff bigger news,\u201d Giuliani told The Daily Beast. \u201cDo it! Give me a chance to give a couple speeches about it and hold a press conference. I\u2019d love that\u2026 I think it\u2019d be a fun fight. I\u2019ll just compare it to all the things they\u2019re not investigating\u2026 If they want, we can have a big fight over this.\u201d\n\nThe former New York City mayor insisted there was \u201cnothing illegal or unethical about\u201d any of his overseas trips or foreign work in the Trump era, and accused Democrats on Capitol Hill of \u201ctrashing the Constitution\u201d and potentially engaging in the \u201cbiggest misuse\u201d of congressional power \u201csince Joe McCarthy.\u201d\n\nThe news of a potential Giuliani probe comes as Democrats on the Hill are attempting to ramp up their investigations into President Trump. Several congressional committees, including judiciary and oversight, have called on former Trump officials to cooperate in their investigations. But the White House has stonewalled those efforts, refusing to acquiesce to witness-interview and document-production requests.\n\nIn response, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler\u2019s (D-NY) plans on introducing a resolution next week that would allow committees to sue the Trump administration and witnesses from the Mueller probe who do not comply with subpoenas, according to Democratic aides.\n\nGiuliani would be, perhaps, the highest-profile investigative target to date. The president\u2019s lawyer ultimately canceled his trip to Ukraine amid a backlash from Democrats and some disapproval from Republicans. But prior to that, he\u2019d been open about his plans to go to the country to help uncover information on the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe and to encourage investigators to look into whether Biden had influenced a case that had been brought against his eldest son. As The New York Times first reported, Giuliani was seeking information on the involvement of Hunter Biden in an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. During the Obama administration, Vice President Biden had pushed for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office controlled the inquiries into the company, on which Biden\u2019s son had a seat on the board.\n\nGiuliani, much of pro-Trump media, and President Trump himself had tried to frame the Biden story as a major political scandal. But it has since fizzled out. A Bloomberg News report noted that testimony from a former Ukrainian official and internal documents did not match the timeline or narrative that Biden had intervened to benefit Hunter. \u201cThere was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close [the] cases,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Daily Beast last month, the day before he nixed the trip, Giuliani said that he was briefing the president on his progress in Ukraine. He also noted that, based on their private conversations, he believed he had the full blessing of President Trump to keep digging on any actions Biden had taken. He mocked critics who accused him of \u201cgoing after poor Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe answers lie in Ukraine,\u201d Giuliani insisted then. \u201cThis is what a defense lawyer does\u2026 I\u2019m going after it like a hound dog.\u201d\n\nAt the time, he compared his investigative jaunt to the kind of work done by Perry Mason, a fictional lawyer-detective from the 1950s and \u201960s TV series.\n\nIn addition to Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine, congressional Democrats are also said to be interested in the trips he has taken to Armenia and Romania.\n\nGiuliani sent a letter to Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in August 2018 recommending changes to the country\u2019s anti-corruption program. The contents of that letter diverged from the official State Department stance on the issue. He told Politico that he was paid for writing the letter by a global consulting firm. In October 2018, Giuliani appeared in Armenia, reportedly invited there by an Armenian businessman who lives in Russia. At the time, Giuliani said he was in Armenia as a \u201cprivate citizen.\u201d He spoke at a conference alongside a sanctioned Russian official.\n\n\u201cI hope they do investigate me for that because I would resist\u2026 and go on a rampage,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them I won\u2019t comply [with a subpoena or any request] unless you investigate Biden first!\u201d\n\nHe then added that such a probe, if launched by Democratic lawmakers, \u201cwould be harassment of the worst kind,\u201d and that it would \u201calso [be] interfering in my role as an attorney\u201d for President Trump.", "description": "The president\u2019s lawyer says he welcomes the scrutiny and plans to turn it to his advantage.", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "National Security Reporter", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1559871600/190503-swin-rudy-tease_ctd5bd", "published_at": "2019-06-07"}
