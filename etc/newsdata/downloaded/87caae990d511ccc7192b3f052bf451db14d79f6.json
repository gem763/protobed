Only citizens can contest presidential elections.\n\nGotabaya is a hero to many Sinhalese, who are Buddhist and make up about 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 22 million people, over his role in ending a 26-year civil war in 2009.\n\nAs secretary of defence under his brother's rule, Gotabaya played a key role in ending the Tamil Tigers' campaign for an independent state for ethnic minority Tamils. But he was accused of using extralegal methods and cracking down on those who criticised his style.\n\n190517033533121\n\nDuring the decade that he served as defence secretary, the military was accused of various abuses, including torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.\n\nA United Nations panel found breaches of international law by both the Sri Lankan government and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nNamed by the main opposition Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party as its presidential candidate last month, Rajapaksa also faces uncertainty over a legal battle regarding misappropriation of funds.\n\nStill, Rajapaksa's popularity has grown in recent months, especially after it emerged that the government had failed to act on repeated intelligence warnings from India before the Easter Day bombings that killed 250 people, which were claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) armed group.\n\nMost Buddhist leaders, and some victims of the \"terror attacks\", have since expressed their desire for the Rajapaksa family to return to power.\n\nThe activists who filed the petition, Gamini Viyangoda, an official of a citizens' group and Chandraguptha Thenuwara, an artist and lecturer, have campaigned for democracy, good governance and rule of law.\n\nIn the 2015 presidential election, they had backed the winner, Maithripala Sirisena, against Mahinda Rajapaksa.", "description": "Appeal court in Sri Lanka clears way for former defence secretary to register as a candidate in next month's elections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/7ab4964f02a442619c608e3f9be5f292_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
