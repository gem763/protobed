I've converted those prices to U.S. dollars via the popular tool XE Currency Converter to help inform your booking choices worldwide.\n\nKeep reading to find out the 10 cities where a hotel is cheaper than Airbnb, including top-reviewed properties you should consider the next time you visit.", "description": "A new study reveals the 10 cities where average nightly rates for a hotel are cheaper than an Airbnb.", "authors": ["Emily Hochberg"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8bbc812e22af40c4359ac4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
