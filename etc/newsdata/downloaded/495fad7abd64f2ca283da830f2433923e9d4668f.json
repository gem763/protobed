Occasionally, as the warming waters dissolve the bottom of one of the icebergs, it becomes top-heavy and does a somersault, as if it were playing instead of dying.\n\nThe Wahlenberg glacier above the fjord naturally calves, sheering off the icebergs into the water. But here it is happening at an increasing rate because of the warming ocean waters, says Kim Holmen, the international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute.\n\nHolmen, has lived in the northern Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard for three decades. He describes the changes he\u2019s seen as \u201cprofound, large and rapid\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWe are losing the Svalbard we know. We are losing the Arctic as we know it because of climate change,\u201d he says amid the constant crackle and trickle of the ice dissolving. \u201cThis is a forewarning of all the hardship and problems that will spread around the planet.\u201d\n\nSince 1970, average annual temperatures have risen by 4C in Svalbard, with winter temperatures rising more than 7 degrees, according to a report released by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Services in February. The Climate in Svalbard 2100 report also warns that the annual mean air temperature in Svalbard is projected to increase by 7-10C by the end of this century.\n\nThat\u2019s not good news for Svalbard\u2019s main town, Longyearbyen. With a population of slightly more than 2,000 people, it is the northernmost town on the planet. It is also the fastest-warming.\n\nErosion also threatens homes here. Three years ago, as winter approached, 13 meters of coastline fell away overnight.\n\nThe spectre of climate change looms large over Audun Salte\u2019s dog farm. The Norwegian owns Svalbard Husky with his wife, Mia. Salte worries that as temperatures warm, climate change could lead to the extinction of all life on Earth. A man who likes kissing and dancing with his dogs \u2013 he has 110 of them \u2013 he\u2019s concerned most about the non-humans on the planet.\n\n\u201cIf climate change should be the end of humanity, I really don\u2019t care, but if climate change is the end of any animal species who hasn\u2019t contributed anything towards the speeding up of this process, that\u2019s why I am reacting,\u201d he says.\n\nHe compares climate change to an accident that we can\u2019t help staring at, feeling lucky we weren\u2019t the victim: \u201cOn the highway, when people slow down to look at a car crash, climate change is like that because everyone is slowing down to look at the accident but not realising that we are actually the car crash.\u201d\n\nReporting by Alex Fraser, Reuters", "description": "Icebergs float like doomed islands past the small boat as it makes its way through a fjord filled with the slush of a melting glacier.
