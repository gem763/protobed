The bill was finally withdrawn in September.\n\nClashes between police and activists have been becoming increasingly violent, with police using tear gas and activists storming parliament.\n\nThe extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April. It would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, under certain circumstances.\n\nOpponents said this risked exposing Hong Kongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. After weeks of protests, leader Carrie Lam eventually said the bill would be suspended indefinitely.\n\nHow did the protests escalate?\n\nProtesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely. The bill was finally withdrawn in September.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The protests have often escalated into violent clashes\n\nBy then clashes between police and protesters had become more frequent and more violent, with injuries on both sides and scores of people arrested.\n\nPolice have fired tear gas and rubber bullets while some activists have thrown bricks, firebombs and other objects.\n\nIn July, protesters stormed parliament, defacing parts of it. Also in July, a masked mob armed with sticks - suspected to be triad gangsters - assaulted pro-democracy protesters and passers-by inside Yuen Long station, far from the city centre.\n\nIn August, one protester was injured in the eye, leading to demonstrators wearing red-coloured eye patches to show their solidarity.\n\nProtest action at Hong Kong international airport in August also saw renewed clashes and led to hundreds of flights being cancelled.\n\nWhat do the protesters want?\n\nThe protesters' demands have changed over the weeks. They also include:\n\nWithdrawal of the \"riot\" description used about the protests\n\nAmnesty for all arrested protesters\n\nAn independent inquiry into alleged police brutality\n\nUniversal suffrage for the elections of the chief executive and Legislative Council, Hong Kong's parliament.\n\nSome also want the resignation of Carrie Lam, whom they view as Beijing's puppet. It's not clear if scrapping the bill will end the protests - some opponents see the move as too little, too late.\n\nAfter initially staying quiet on the unrest, China has condemned the Hong Kong protests as \"behaviour that is close to terrorism\" - a sign its approach is hardening.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThere have also been reports of Chinese police and military massing across the border in Shenzhen, in a clear show of force.\n\nProtests supporting the Hong Kong movement have spread across the globe, with rallies taking place in the UK, France, US, Canada and Australia.\n\nIn many cases, people supporting the Hong Kong demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies.\n\nWhat is Hong Kong's status?\n\nHong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997.\n\nIt is run under a \"one country, two systems\" agreement that guarantees it a level of autonomy.\n\nIt has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China. Those rights including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are protected.\n\nBut those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nRead this:\n\nWatch this:\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Helier Cheung on why people are taking to the streets in Hong Kong", "description": "All you need to know about the demonstrations in Hong Kong - the short and the long story.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7876/production/_108283803_gettyimages-1154553368.jpg"}
