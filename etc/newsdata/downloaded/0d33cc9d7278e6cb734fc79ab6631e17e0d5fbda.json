(Picture: @alexanderludwig/Instagram)\n\nVikings star Alexander Ludwig has dropped a string of brand new pictures from season six.\n\nTreating his fans to a sneak peek of what\u2019s to come in the final, the 27-year-old posted a series of snaps onto his Instagram.\n\nAnd it seems he\u2019s mourning the loss of his mother, Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick).\n\nWhile the former queen does appear in one, several other photos show our Nordic favourites looking glum as they stare down at the ground \u2013 presumably at the shieldmaiden\u2019s body.\n\nPictures of a Viking funeral have been leaked ahead of the series, with fans speculating whether or not it is Lags who finally meets her end.\n\nHowever, other viewers were sure it was Bjorn\u2019s funeral \u2013 although we\u2019re not as convinced.\n\nVikings star Alexander Ludwig shares new season 6 photos (Picture: @alexanderludwig/Instagram)\n\nWhose funeral is he at? (Picture: @alexanderludwig/Instagram)\n\nIn the caption, the actor wrote: \u2018New stills from #vikings #season6 #december4 9/8c whose ready?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans were quick to comment, and couldn\u2019t help but share their excitement for the next installment of the History Channel hit.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m ready! But not ready for it to end,\u2019 one replied, while another added: \u2018Looking forward to watching it.\u2019\n\nSomeone else wrote: \u2018Oh yes we\u2019re ready since last year!

Yet whether or not he will survive is another question.\n\nThe trailer states that the Cold War has started \u2013 but how many more battles can Bjorn survive before he enters the gates of Valhalla?\n\nIvar warns his big bro: \u2018You have no idea what you are now facing,\u2019 to which the warrior can be heard shouting: \u2018We must resist.\u2019\n\nStaring out to sea, he adds: \u2018Nothing will ever be the same again.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHas he lost hope, and will he start to give up? Or will Bjorn see the end of the battle and take home the crown \u2013 finally defeating Ivar?\n\nVikings season six will drop onto the History Channel and Amazon Prime on 4 December.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
