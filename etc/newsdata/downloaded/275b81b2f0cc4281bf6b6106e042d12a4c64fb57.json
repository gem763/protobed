He also wrote asking them to take steps that would benefit the food manufacturer Lynn\u2019s Country Foods and the healthcare firm Randox.\n\nThe documents raise questions over whether the North Shropshire MP has broken parliamentary rules that permit MPs to lobby on behalf of a paying client, but with restrictions: the lobbying must not help to give an exclusive financial benefit to the client, and the client must not have initiated the lobbying.\n\nPaterson has also twice used House of Commons stationery to write to ministers on behalf of Randox. According to the rules, House of Commons stationery cannot be used for \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d.\n\nMPs are permitted to have consultancies under the parliamentary rules and are required to declare them in the parliamentary register of financial interests.\n\nPaterson declares that he receives a total of \u00a3112,000 a year from the two firms, on top of his parliamentary salary of \u00a379,000. He charges them \u00a3500 an hour.\n\nJon Trickett MP, Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet office minister, said: \u201cIt is simply not right that an elected representative can use their influence to lobby on behalf of big business, and get paid handsomely doing it.\n\n\u201cHe has serious questions to answer, but the real scandal here is just how weak the rules concerning lobbying by MPs are.\u201d\n\nOwen Paterson trips worth \u00a339,000 funded by unknown donors Read more\n\nAsked to comment, Paterson said: \u201cMy financial interests have been correctly declared according to the rules of the House of Commons.\u201d\n\nSince 2016, Paterson has been paid \u00a312,000 a year by Lynn\u2019s Country Foods, a Northern Irish food manufacturer, to be a consultant.\n\nHe assisted the firm in a sustained lobbying campaign that lasted more than a year. He attended five meetings with the Food Standards Agency, which is responsible for food safety. Three of the meetings were with Heather Hancock, the FSA\u2019s chair.\n\nThe firm sells Finnebrogue Naked Bacon, which it markets as a healthy alternative to traditional bacon. Its product is processed without the nitrite preservatives in most bacon that have been linked to cancer.\n\nInstead the firm uses another additive mix derived from fruits, spices and ascorbic acid. Its original labels said the bacon was made without E numbers, but the FSA said the ascorbic acid needed to be declared as an E number and the claim removed. Over many months, Lynn\u2019s and Paterson sought to persuade the FSA that it did not.\n\nIn January last year, Paterson wrote to Hancock outlining what he said the FSA had agreed to do at a meeting with him and Lynn\u2019s employees. According to the documents, the FSA complained internally that Paterson and Lynn\u2019s were making \u201cinaccurate assertions\u201d about the outcome of the meeting.\n\nSix months later, an FSA official noted in a memo to Hancock that the FSA had devoted \u201cconsiderable resources\u201d to explaining the EU legal requirements to the firm and had \u201cregularly engaged with the parties and Mr Paterson\u201d since the firm first raised the issue in November 2017.\n\nDocuments released under freedom of information legislation show how Hancock emailed a colleague in July last year describing \u201ca key theme of the pressure from Mr Paterson and [Lynn\u2019s] to agree to their position\u201d.\n\nIn a subsequent letter to Paterson, Hancock said she had been assured by Lynn\u2019s that the additive mix \u201chad been authorised by several European Union member states and that the FSA should therefore rely on this and cease any further requests for information either by us or by the local authority\u201d.\n\nHowever, the FSA contacted their counterparts in other countries, who replied that they had not given any such approval. Hancock told Paterson this discovery did not bear out Lynn\u2019s claim and \u201cdefinitely cannot be used by the FSA to bypass our usual authorisations and processes\u201d.\n\nThe dispute appears to have ended in December 2018, when Lynn\u2019s agreed to declare on the label of Finnebrogue naked bacon that its product contained an additive.\n\nPaterson also lobbied the FSA on behalf of Randox, which has paid him since 2015.\n\nIn 2016, he and Randox met Hancock, and the company suggested that antibiotic residues had been found in milk sold in supermarkets. Randox said it had developed a technique that could detect antibiotic residues in milk, and suggested the FSA adopt it for widespread testing.\n\nAt a meeting with Paterson last December, Hancock \u201cexplained yet again\u201d to him that her agency did not have official responsibility for deciding how milk should be monitored.\n\nAn FSA memo said that in response to Randox\u2019s suggestion the agency had collected samples of milk, but found little of concern.\n\nThe Guardian has previously reported Paterson helped Randox as it sought contracts from the Department for International Development. In 2016, he wrote on House of Commons stationery to Priti Patel, then international development secretary, asking her to meet with Randox.\n\nIn January 2017, Paterson and a Randox employee met Rory Stewart, then a junior DFID minister, and discussed, among other issues, \u201cpotential commercial opportunities Randox may wish to explore\u201d.\n\nFour days later, Paterson wrote to Stewart promoting Randox\u2019s \u201creliable blood tests\u201d, which, he said, \u201cwould appear to be an excellent use of UK aid resources\u201d. Paterson listed a number of ways that DFID could assist Randox win contracts.\n\nIn 2017, Randox doubled its fee to Paterson to nearly \u00a3100,000 a year. Randox said: \u201cIt is a matter of public record that Owen Paterson has worked for Randox Laboratories Ltd since August 2015.\u201d\n\nLynn\u2019s Country Foods said: \u201cOwen Paterson\u2019s consultancy for Lynn\u2019s Country Foods is a matter for the public record. We do not propose to comment further at this time.\u201d", "description": "Documents raise questions over whether former minister broke parliamentary rules", "authors": ["Rob Evans", "Felicity Lawrence", "David Pegg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0ad632df1a94e18b03fd6249f6fc98e2c45188d/0_58_4265_2559/master/4265.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c257a2d0585c7491cb08715a7ed982a3", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
