They'd enjoyed dinner at their favourite restaurant, followed by drinks at a bar, where they met Bulgarian model and student, Georgi Dochev.\n\nThe trio partied at the Black Cat nightclub in Palma before heading back to their apartment at around 5.30am, where Georgi claimed they kissed.\n\nSoon after, Stephen fell asleep on the sofa with Andrew's arm wrapped around him.\n\nNot realising he had died, Andrew cuddled him for three hours before going to sleep in their own bed - where Georgi alleged they were intimate.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nIt was only when the latter stopped to have a cigarette on his way out at around 1.30pm that he noticed Stephen still hadn't moved and his hands were white.\n\n\"I went to take his pulse and couldn\u2019t find one. I knew he was dead,\" he told The Sun in 2014, admitting he didn't know how to break the news to Andrew.\n\n\u201cI went into the bedroom and said, \u2018I\u2019m going. Let\u2019s wake Stephen up so I can say goodbye\u2019. Andy replied, \u2018No, leave him sleeping\u2019 and that\u2019s when I told him Stephen looked strange,\" he said.\n\nReliving the heartbreaking scenes as Andrew frantically tried to revive his husband, Georgi continued, \u201cAndy was whispering, \u2018Come on baby, wake up\u2019. He began slapping him round the face when he didn\u2019t respond.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cWhen he too realised he was dead, he broke down in tears. He then tried to revive him by giving him mouth-to-mouth but there was nothing either of\n\nus could do.\u201d\n\nStephen was pronounced dead at 2.25pm and an autopsy ruled he'd died from natural causes up to eight hours before.\n\n\u201cWe know from the pathologist\u2019s report that Stephen died sleeping with me on the sofa,\u201d devastated Andrew told The Mirror.\n\n\u201cI know that my boy fell asleep under my arm, his heart stopped, he didn\u2019t feel any pain.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut in the harrowing first hours after the grim discovery, Andrew is said to have been wracked with guilt for not checking on him.\n\n\u201cI will never forgive myself for this. He died and I couldn\u2019t help him. I feel like my life is over,\u201d he is said to have told Stephen's Boyzone bandmates.\n\n\u201cThey kept telling Andy that he shouldn\u2019t blame himself \u2013 but he just kept crying his eyes out.\n\n\u201cThe guy is in a deep state of shock and he hasn\u2019t slept for a minute since this tragedy unfolded. He is a total mess.\u201d", "description": "Andrew Cowles thought his husband Stephen Gately was just sleeping as he cuddled him on the sofa.
