Morgan boosts price target to highest on the Street", "language": "en", "text": "Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.23% rose 0.3% in premarket trading Monday, putting them on track to extend the streak of record closes to four sessions, after J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target enough to make him the most bullish on the Street. The stock has closed at record highs six times in the past 11 sessions. Chatterjee kept his rating at overweight but boosted his price target to $275, which is now the highest of the 42 analysts surveyed by FactSet, from $265, saying investor confidence in a \"strong multi-year earnings growth trajectory is now higher.\" His target is 30% above the average target of $211.08, which is actually 14% below Friday's closing price of $246.58. Chatterjee's note comes two days before Apple reports fiscal fourth-quarter results, after Wednesday's closing bell. \"Heading into the F4Q19 (Sept-end) earnings report on Oct. 30th, the recent strong run in the shares suggests that investor expectations are primed for a robust 2019 iPhone product cycle, followed by a stronger 2020 (led by 5G replacement cycle), in combination with a re-acceleration of services revenues led by the launch of new services,\" Chatterjee wrote in a note to clients. The stock has shot up 18.7% over the past three months while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.57% has slipped 0.9%.", "description": "Shares of Apple Inc. rose 0.3% in premarket trading Monday, putting them on track to extend the streak of record closes to four sessions, after J.P.
