On the Elite", "language": "en", "text": "Whenever the Left makes a characterization of the Right, it\u2019s safe to be that it\u2019s probably projection. \u201cProjection\u201d is when someone attempts to mask one\u2019s own negative attributes or characteristics by attributing them to others.\n\nChristine Blasey Ford accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, but the Left\u2014from Hollywood to Jeffrey Epstein to drag queen story hour for kids at public libraries\u2014is a putrid cesspool of rape and pedophilia.\n\nConservatives are labeled as racists, but the Left features such luminaries as recently fired anti-white New York Times editor Sarah Jeong and blackface aficionados like Virginia governor Ralph Northam and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nTrump is said to be a despot, but campus leftists stifle dissent and Antifa freely employs violence to that end.\n\nWhen Eric Holder says that Republicans will cheat in the 2020 election, it means that Democrats will cheat in the 2020 election.\n\nSince the appointment of Robert Mueller to investigate \u201cRussian collusion,\u201d the Left gleefully and incessantly has been reporting the claim that \u201cthe walls are closing in\u201d on Trump. Trump\u2019s pervasive corruption is always just about to be exposed. Every leak, every hint, every indictment brought with it confident predictions of Trump\u2019s demise. Trump\u2019s enemies, \u201cthe good guys\u201d in their narrative, would finally put right what went horribly wrong in the 2016 election.\n\nThen the much-anticipated Mueller Report landed with a thud. Mueller himself went before Congress, and all hope that he would deliver Trump into their hands suddenly vanished. In the aftermath, Trump vowed to investigate the investigators.\n\nAttorney General William Barr said that \u201cI think spying did occur\u201d on the Trump administration, which sent the political class into conniptions. Reports are now surfacing that Barr traveled to Italy to investigate the origins of the Russian collusion hoax, while Barr and prosecutor John Durham have requested the assistance of multiple governments in their investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the increasingly strident posture of the progressive wing of her party, Nancy Pelosi refused to rush to impeachment. Mindful of the political consequences of the Republicans\u2019 impeachment of Bill Clinton, Pelosi sought to placate her radicals while avoiding that drastic step. Then the Ukraine \u201cwhistleblower\u201d report dropped, and within a few days all restraint was gone and Pelosi had delighted the Left by announcing impeachment proceedings.\n\nA two-year investigation by Robert Mueller and his massive staff could not induce Pelosi to move on impeachment, but the whistleblower report could and did? The report itself is nothing more than a motley collection of hearsay and publicly available media reports. In short order we learned that the intelligence community had secretly altered its whistleblower rules to allow for complaints based on hearsay only days before this report was submitted.\n\nPelosi admitted in an interview, and Rep. Adam Schiff (D.-Calif.) admitted on Twitter that they knew about the allegations before the report was filed. Schiff was even caught fabricating dialogue from that conversation during a congressional hearing. The Mueller investigation had a veneer of respectability, but the Ukraine scandal is nothing but, to borrow Trump\u2019s words, \u201cridiculous bullshit.\u201d\n\nIf the Ukraine corruption case is so obviously weak, why rush to use it as a basis for impeachment? The best answer is that they\u2019re scared. They needed something, anything, to bring down this administration, and this was the best weapon they had on hand at that moment. They\u2019re not just scared for 2020. If it were that, they would have saved the Ukraine scandal for next year\u2019s election, just as they sat on Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe personal corruption and moral bankruptcy of our elite are ripe for exposure. The scandals of the Obama administration, which have been hushed by a supine media, could be thrust before the public. The attempts of our elites and their allies in the bureaucracy to prevent Trump\u2019s election or to depose him after he became president, are clearly targets of Barr\u2019s and Durham\u2019s investigations. Once the dominoes begin to fall, who can say what will follow?\n\nThe fear, however, goes much deeper even than that. The entire globalist neoliberal order is teetering on the brink. Trump was nominated and elected by people who are tired of endless wars of supposed democratization for people uninterested in it and unfit for its responsibilities. They are tired of the mass importation of illegals and refugees who don\u2019t understand or care about our principles or way of life. They are tired an economic system that brings ruin to the American working and middle classes and of the intensifying persecution of normal Americans.\n\nThe anti-globalist reaction is, well, global. Benjamin Netanyahu keeps winning in Israel. Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Narendra Modi in India. Viktor Orban in Hungary. Boris Johnson. Brexit. There are anti-globalist movements in Germany, Italy, and Austria. The global elites are losing control of the world order they labored to create for decades: a borderless oligarchy that empowers and enriches them at the expense of the people they rule.\n\nIn retrospect, the signs of liberal desperation have been obvious from the day after the 2016 election. The hysterical demands for resistance a outrance. The Mueller investigation. Talk about the Emoluments Clause and the 25th Amendment. The Kavanaugh smear. Hate crime hoaxes. The New York Times\u2019 campaign to brand Trump and his supporters white supremacists. Ukraine. Abroad, the Amazon rainforest fires as an attempt to discredit Bolsonaro. Decades-old groping allegations against Boris Johnson. Netanyahu scandals. The western elite\u2019s open hatred for Viktor Orban. And on, and on, and on.\n\nWhen today\u2019s faux scandals blow over, something else will be lurking to take their place. Trump represents an existential threat to the power and privilege of our elites; they have to destroy him. Each attempt gets a little more desperate, however, and it shows. The more afraid they become, the more obvious and ridiculous are their projections. Every time they predict Trump\u2019s downfall, they\u2019re masking their own insecurities. Every time they accuse his administration of corruption, they\u2019re trying to distract from their own corruption. It will get worse before it gets better, but time is running out. \u201cThe walls are closing in\u201d on them, and they know it.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178616818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
