Some sacks I want back.\u201d\n\nJackson, the 2016 Heisman Trophy winner, outdid the 2018 Heisman winner, Arizona rookie quarterback Kyler Murray, who went 25 for 40 for 349 yards but fell short of carrying the Cardinals to a second straight fourth-quarter comeback.\n\nDak Prescott Does Everything in Cowboys Win\n\nLANDOVER, Md. \u2014 Dak Prescott probably could have kept running \u2014 maybe all the way to the end zone.\n\nInstead, the Dallas Cowboys quarterback stiff-armed Washington Redskins cornerback Josh Norman to put an exclamation point on his longest run of the game. Prescott spent Sunday afternoon carving up the Redskins\u2019 defense with his arms and legs to the tune of 26 of 30 passing for 269 yards and three touchdowns and 69 yards rushing in a 31-21 Cowboys victory to improve to 2-0.\n\n\u201cIf Dak could run the ball well and he can pass the ball well like he showed today, how can you prepare for us?\u201d wide receiver Amari Cooper said. \u201cWe as a team can run the ball well and pass the ball well. It\u2019s hard to prepare for that.\u201d\n\nA week after putting up a perfect 158.3 passer rating, Prescott responded from an interception to lead Dallas on consecutive touchdown drives of 97, 83 and 75 yards.", "description": "The Rams (and the refs) beat the Saints, the Patriots, Cowboys and Chiefs romped, and a few young quarterbacks continued to prove their doubters wrong.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/sports/16nfl-learned-top/16nfl-learned-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
