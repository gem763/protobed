Ferrell has teamed up with iHeartMedia to create a new podcast network called Big Money Players Network, which was announced today. The network will focus on both scripted and unscripted comedy podcasts, and the plan is to release ten new podcasts over the next two years, with the first shows debuting sometime in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe iHeartPodcast Network has been such a pleasure to work with. I love hanging out in the offices and I\u2019ve only been yelled at once for using someone\u2019s computer, which I shouldn\u2019t have done,\u201d said Ferrell in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to continuing our journey as creative partners and helping to define how comedy and podcasting will merge in the next couple years.\u201d\n\nFerrell\u2019s network joins a growing slate of newer podcast networks. My Favorite Murder co-hosts Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark launched the Exactly Right network last year, while Amanda Lund, Maria Blasucci, and Priyanka Mattoo launched Earios earlier this year. The comedy-podcast-network space is already pretty crowded, with networks like Earwolf, Forever Dog, and HeadGum being well-established with long lineups of comedy offerings and long-running shows. But best of luck to Ferrell trying to merge the comedy and podcasting worlds with his new venture!", "description": "Comedian and actor Will Ferrell has partnered up with iHeartMedia to launch a new comedy podcast network called Big Money Players Network, which will begin premiering new shows in 2020.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-will-ferrell.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
