If he fails, the country will be on course to leave the bloc without a deal on Oct. 31, or to delay exit day for a third time.\n\n\u201cThis is our chance in the U.K. as democrats to get Brexit done,\u201d Johnson told a press conference in Brussels on Thursday. \u201cPeople want to move this thing on, it\u2019s been going on for a long time.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t be drawn on what he would he do if he loses the vote.\n\nDefeat could unleash a political crisis unparalleled in modern times: despite EU leaders leaving open the possibility they could allow Britain more time to leave, Johnson has steadfastly refused to delay Brexit beyond Oct. 31. With any attempt to leave without a deal likely to face legal challenge, he may have to allow his plans to be put to voters in a general election, or even a second referendum.\n\nIf he is to win Saturday\u2019s vote, Johnson needs to secure the support of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which has categorically opposed the agreement he reached with the European Union on Wednesday. He is also seeking to woo reluctant members of his own side, and persuade opposition Labour politicians to back him, if he is to prevail.\n\nThe parliamentary arithmetic is very tight, all the more so since the DUP said it is unable to support the accord. The loyalist party is opposed to Northern Ireland being treated any differently to the rest of the U.K.\n\nUnder Johnson\u2019s plans, the region would still be subject to some of the EU\u2019s single market rules to mitigate the need for customs checks on the border with Ireland. That would, in effect, put a customs border in the Irish Sea.\n\nWill U.K. Parliament Back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit? We Do the Math\n\nJohnson needs to pick up roughly 61 votes from a pool of about 75 Members of Parliament who might be persuaded to join him -- that will involve persuading hold-outs in his own party to come over to his side regardless of what the 10 DUP lawmakers decide.\n\nThere are signs that some Tories who voted down his predecessor Theresa May\u2019s deal -- among them Steve Baker, leader of the self-described \u201cSpartan\u201d group of hard-core Brexiters -- are falling into line.\n\nJohnson, too, is trying to win the support of a significant minority of MPs from the opposition Labour Party who believe the 2016 referendum result must be honored. To woo them, he is preparing to a package of measures, including protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards after Brexit.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a second referendum, saying in Brussels that Johnson\u2019s deal -- which he described as a \u201csell-out\u201d -- was worse than that put forward by May. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said her Scottish Nationalist Party will vote against the deal as well, complaining that it creates too great a separation from the EU.\n\nAs attention swung toward the vote at Westminster, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker offered support to Johnson.\n\n\u201cIf we have a deal, we have a deal and there is no need for prolongation -- that\u2019s not only the British view, that\u2019s my view too,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cHe and myself we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s possible to give another prolongation.\u201d\n\nEven if the decision over whether to grant an extension may not be his, by playing down the chances of another extension, Juncker is framing the vote in the House of Commons as a straight choice between Johnson\u2019s deal or no deal -- just as the British leader has tried to do himself.\n\nThat increases the pressure on undecided lawmakers in Westminster to back the government -- but it also raises the cost of failure dramatically.\n\n--With assistance from Ian Wishart, Jonathan Stearns, Viktoria Dendrinou, Nikos Chrysoloras, Helene Fouquet, Patrick Donahue, Dara Doyle, John Follain, Katharina Rosskopf, Tiago Ramos Alfaro, Milda Seputyte and Jan Bratanic.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.net;Kitty Donaldson in London at kdonaldson1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Edward Evans, Ben Sills\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson is battling to sell his new Brexit deal to skeptical members of the U.K. Parliament ahead of a crucial vote on Saturday.
