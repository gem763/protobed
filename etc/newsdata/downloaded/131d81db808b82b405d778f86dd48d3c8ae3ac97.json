REUTERS/Jung Yeon-Je/Pool\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea\u2019s prime minister plans to visit Japan next week in what would be the highest-level trip since Japan imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and diplomatic row, the Yonhap news agency reported on Sunday.\n\nLee Nak-yon, whose trip is scheduled for Oct. 22-24, will attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito\u2019s enthronement ceremony on behalf of President Moon Jae-in, Yonhap said, citing presidential officials.\n\nLee is likely to hold talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which would mark the highest-level dialogue since tension flared up last year over the issue of Japan\u2019s wartime use of South Korean forced labour, Yonhap said.\n\n\u201cWe hope his visit would help improve relations,\u201d an unidentified presidential official was quoted as saying by Yonhap.\n\nMoon\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRelations between the neighbours are arguably at their lowest ebb since they normalised ties in 1965, after South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court last year ordered two Japanese companies to compensate some wartime labourers.\n\nJapan says the issue was settled under a 1965 treaty that normalised ties.\n\nThe dispute has since spilled over into trade and security, with Japan slapping export curbs and South Korea scrapping a bilateral intelligence-sharing pact.", "description": "South Korea's prime minister plans to visit Japan next week in what would be the highest-level trip since Japan imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and diplomatic row, the Yonhap news agency reported on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440262092&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C04Z", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
