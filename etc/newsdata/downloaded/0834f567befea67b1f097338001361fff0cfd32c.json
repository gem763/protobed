The president said in a tweet that he would reveal his replacement the following week, but no pick has been announced.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the timing of the announcement or when McAleenan\u2019s last day is, but the search for a new department head may be stalled by a lack of viable options.\n\nTrump often says he prefers leaving officials in an acting capacity because it gives him flexibility. But that preference has left the president boxed in when searching for a new DHS secretary because of the Federal Vacancies Act, which stipulates that the secretary position must be filled by an official confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThere is no Senate confirmed deputy secretary, and the leaders of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are all acting.\n\nActing USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli and acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan were widely viewed as the top contenders for the DHS role, as they have been the public faces of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda in recent months.\n\nMorgan has made multiple appearances in the White House briefing room in recent months to tout the decline in apprehensions at the southern border, and he joined Trump on a recent trip to tour a completed section of fencing.\n\nCuccinelli has similarly used his role to announce a series of executive measures meant to roll back benefits for immigrants.\n\nWhite House personnel director Sean Doocey earlier this month indicated to Trump that neither Morgan nor Cuccinelli would be eligible due to federal vacancy laws.\n\nExperts have noted that the president could choose to ignore the Vacancies Act and appoint one of the two as acting DHS secretary, much like Cuccinelli was appointed to his role despite working outside the government at the time.\n\nDemocrats have grown dismissive of the rumors regarding Trump's thinking on the issue, and most expect Cuccinelli to get the job despite the questions on his eligibility.\n\nRep. Lucille Roybal-Allard Lucille Roybal-AllardSynagogues ramp up security in year since Tree of Life shooting DeLauro enters race to succeed Lowey as Appropriations chief EPA's bold step forward: Good for animals and science, better for people MORE (D-Calif.), the chairwoman of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, said she\u2019s focusing on oversight in her dealings with the department under Trump.\n\n\u201cAs I've told every, every acting secretary, the one thing that is not acceptable and is totally inexcusable is the treatment of the immigrants. That has nothing to do with policy, that has nothing [to do with] trying to protect our borders. This is about treating human beings with respect,\u201d said Roybal-Allard.\n\nAt least one eligible candidate, Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) chief David Pekoske, has ruled out taking the acting secretary job.\n\nOther names being considered for the role include Chad Wolf, an undersecretary for the agency, and Chris Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency branch of DHS.\n\nPeople familiar with discussions also said Ambassador to Mexico Chris Landau\u2019s name has been kicked around, though it\u2019s unclear how serious those considerations have been. The State Department referred questions about Landau to the White House, which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGroups favoring new restrictions on immigration that support the president\u2019s policies panned Wolf, citing his past work as a lobbyist. Those organizations have favored former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Cuccinelli, two individuals with hard-line immigration views and slim hopes of winning Senate confirmation for the full-time role.\n\nCuccinelli has the added downside that Republicans in the Senate are unlikely to confirm him if he's formally nominated to the position, as he helped fund a primary opponent against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid Mark Mellman: Three questions for Republicans Menendez seeks probe into if Pompeo violated Hatch Act MORE (R-Ky.) in 2014.\n\nWith the 2020 election fast approaching and the Senate likely to be consumed by an impeachment trial in the coming months, there is a sense that McAleenan\u2019s replacement represents a last chance for the foreseeable future for Trump to get the right person in place to implement his immigration agenda.\n\n\u201cIt is very frustrating, and I think a lot more could have been done faster had the people at the top shared his agenda and been willing to really stand up and take charge,\u201d said Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for NumbersUSA.\n\nTrump\u2019s first DHS chief, John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE, spoke dismissively of Trump\u2019s long-desired border wall during his tenure as White House chief of staff. Kelly told Fox News in a 2018 interview that Trump was not \u201cfully informed\u201d on the topic, and later said as he left the White House that the administration abandoned the idea of a concrete wall long ago.\n\nKelly\u2019s replacement, Kirstjen Nielsen Kirstjen Michele NielsenHouse Homeland Security Committee subpoenas security officials for testimony on terrorism Trump's new challenge is officials dishing dirt Nielsen on leaving Trump administration: 'Saying no and refusing to do it myself was not going to be enough' MORE, said at a recent Fortune Magazine event that she quit earlier this year because she felt it was not enough for her to refuse to implement policies that violated the law.\n\nMcAleenan was accused by some of the president\u2019s allies of leaking information about widespread ICE raids that led to the operation being canceled, a charge he denied. But shortly before leaving, McAleenan told The Washington Post he felt he did not control the department\u2019s tone and messaging, an implied criticism of some of the president\u2019s more hard-line surrogates.\n\nTrump has turned DHS into a de facto immigration enforcement agency tasked with carrying out his most high-profile campaign pledges, including building the wall and curbing the number of migrants entering the country.\n\nBut career officials worry that singular focus is coming at the expense of other critical functions of DHS, such as cybersecurity, counterterrorism and emergency management.\n\nDavid Lapan, a former spokesman for DHS during the Trump administration, said Trump\u2019s emphasis on immigration limits the candidate pool for the secretary job to those with a background in immigration enforcement and could make it difficult for any qualified individual to last in the role.\n\n\u201cBecause of the president\u2019s outsize focus on the southwest border, it seems that the measure of success for him in a secretary or an acting secretary is affecting the number of people who show up at our southwest border,\u201d Lapan said. \u201cAnd with that as a metric it\u2019s an impossible job.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mcaleenankevin_071819as3_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
