But behind closed doors, they worry that the Trump team's inexperience may ultimately end up jeopardizing its efforts to wipe climate rules off the books.\n\nIndustry lawyer Mark Barron, at a a private meeting of oil and gas executives in Colorado Springs, openly worried that the courts might ultimately throw out key parts of the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda under challenge by environmental groups.\n\n\u201cThe current [Interior Secretary, David Bernhardt] is a competent technocrat but the other folks who are in the office are inexperienced government folks,\u201d Barron said, referring to political appointees at key agencies, according to a recording obtained by The Post\u2019s Juliet Eilperin.\n\n\u201cAnd so they may want to implement policy, but at some point, you need people who are familiar with Washington, who know how to draft a regulatory rule, who have experience doing it on a big level,\" said Barron, who heads the energy litigation arm of Baker Hostetler, at the June 24 meeting of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.\n\nIPAA, which represents small and midsize oil and gas companies, has publicly been one of the biggest backers of the Trump administration\u2019s rollbacks aimed at curbing methane leaks, protecting endangered species and other issues.\n\nBut privately, Barron echoed an observation of many outside the oil and gas business: The administration\u2019s rush to write regulations has left it vulnerable to courtroom challenges.\n\n\u201cI'm going to be candid; some of those recissions were done by too few people and at too fast a pace,\u201d Barron said.\n\nAnd Democratic state attorneys general and environmental groups have been eager to exploit those weaknesses. The Trump administration has won only two of the 27 cases brought by states and environmental groups over environmental regulations as of the end of August, according to an analysis of the Institute for Policy Integrity.\n\nKathleen C. Schroder, a partner at Davis, Graham and Stubbs, was less critical of the Trump administration\u2019s rulemaking approach at the IPAA meeting. But she did note that some rollbacks could create confusion among staff overseeing oil and gas leasing.\n\nIn June, the White House Council on Environmental Quality reversed an Obama-era climate policy, telling agencies they no longer have to take a project\u2019s long-term climate impacts into account when assessing how it will affect the environment.\n\nThe guidance \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have enough teeth,\u201d Schroder said. And legal teeth, she added, would make it easier for lawyers to defend a federal leasing decision in court.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not helpful in the sense of what the agency needs to know, when it does its climate change analysis is, literally, \u2018What do I do?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAsked about the session, both Schroder and a spokeswoman at Baker Hostetler declined to comment further.\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

Fewer local plants went extinct. The plant richness \u2014 the number of species \u2014 swelled each year.

Not only is that causing drought conditions to intensify and expand, but the drier ground is easier to heat up \u2014 which makes temperatures head even higher. It\u2019s a vicious self-reinforcing cycle,\u201d The Post\u2019s Matthew Cappucci and Jason Samenow report. \u201c\u2026As the climate continues to warm, heat domes such as the one predicted over the next week are expected to become more intense. That keeps summerlike weather around deeper into the fall, and data show that this is already happening.\u201d\n\nMaryland Politics A solar panel for every house?
