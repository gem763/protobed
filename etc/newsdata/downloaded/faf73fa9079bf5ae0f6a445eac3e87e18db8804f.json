The stock market rally is on the cusp of a record high, led by the S&P 500. Apple (AAPL) is at new highs, with one last test to confirm Apple stock as a long-term winner again. Microsoft stock and Amazon stock will react to the Pentagon awarding a $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing contract to Microsoft (MSFT) over Amazon.com (AMZN).\n\nX\n\nApple earnings are on tap Wednesday night while the Apple TV+ streaming service launches Friday. On Monday night, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reports. Google earnings headline a thin slate of Monday reports, along with Beyond Meat (BYND) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM).\n\nApple stock, Microsoft stock, Google stock and Amazon stock are the four biggest companies by market cap.\n\nFrance's LVMH (LVMUY) has offered $14.5 billion for U.S. jeweler Tiffany (TIF). The Louis Vuitton parent is offering $120 a share for Tiffany stock, a 22% premium. Tiffany may reject the LVMH bid. Tiffany stock in 2019 has risen, largely in line with the S&P 500 index, after tumbling in late 2018.\n\nDow Jones Futures Today\n\nDow Jones futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value, with Microsoft stock perhaps boosting blue chips. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.3%.\n\nOvernight action in Dow futures doesn't always translate into the next stock market session. During earnings season, Dow Jones futures can swing as results come in, followed by investors taking a different view during regular trading.\n\nCurrent Stock Market Rally\n\nThe current stock market rally is starting to clear key resistance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% last week, the S&P 500 index 1.2% and the Nasdaq composite 1.9%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq topped September peaks, with the S&P moving within a point of its July all-time high.\n\nThe Dow Jones today is just about 1% below its record levels.\n\nAmong the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) rose 1.9% last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) climbed 2%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) soared 4.1%, hitting a new high.\n\nIs This A Bull Market?\n\nThe stock market rally is looking good, but it's still unclear if we're in a new or revived secular bull market. The major averages haven't hit record highs yet. And even when the stock market rally has moved into new high ground this year, it's quickly run into trouble.\n\nThe Nasdaq composite is not far above its August 2018 peak. The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones haven't made much progress since January 2018.\n\nIf the stock market rally can break into new high ground and sustain the advance, that would be a clear signal that it's a long-term bull market.\n\nIt's no surprise that the stock market rally revived with better China trade news. The partial China trade deal may yet collapse, triggering another market pullback.\n\nApple Stock\n\nApple stock has run up 56% in 2019 and is extended from a 221.47 flat-base buy point. The Dow Jones component cleared its October 2018 peak earlier this month.\n\nThe relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has run up since late January. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, is right at its October 2018 peak.\n\nAny outperformance this week by Apple stock will push the RS line into record territory. That's notable, because Apple stock had moved sideways with the S&P 500 index since September 2012. The RS line did hit new highs in August-October 2018 as Apple stock rallied, but that turned out to be a false dawn as the iPhone maker announced big revenue warnings.\n\nApple Earnings\n\nFiscal Q4 Apple earnings are due Oct. 30. Analysts expect Apple earnings to fall 2% to $2.84 a share, the third straight decline. Sales should dip 1% to $62.42 billion. It wouldn't take much of a beat to see Apple earnings and revenue growth.\n\nInvestors will want to know about Apple's holiday-quarter guidance.\n\nApple TV+ launches on Friday, just ahead of the Nov. 12 Disney+ launch. The streaming service costs $4.99 per month, with a free year for new iPhone and other hardware buyers. Apple TV+ isn't going to be a moneymaker for years to come. But it could encourage people to stay in the Apple ecosystem.\n\nMicrosoft Is JEDI Knight, Defeating Amazon\n\nIn somewhat of a surprise, the Pentagon awarded Microsoft a cloud-computing contract over Amazon. The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure is intended to help improve data security and military real-time information sharing.\n\nThe JEDI contract is a big deal as Microsoft gains ground vs. Amazon Web Services in cloud-computing services.\n\nLast week Microsoft earnings topped views, fueled by cloud growth.\n\nMicrosoft stock rose 2.4% last week to 140.74, regaining its 50-day and nearing a 142.47 buy point from a flat base, Marketsmith shows. Microsoft stock is one of several IBD 50 stocks near buy points.\n\nSecond only to Apple stock at $1.11 trillion, Microsoft stock has a $1.08 trillion market cap.\n\nAmazon earnings fell more than expected last week as the e-commerce giant invests in one-day free shipping capability. Amazon stock tumbled Friday morning, but closed down just 1.1%, actually edging higher for the week. But Amazon stock is below its 50- and 200-day lines, with its RS line right at eight-month lows.\n\nGoogle Earnings\n\nGoogle earnings are due Monday night. Wall Street expects Google earnings to rise 4% to $12.38 a share, with revenue up 19.5% to $40.32 billion. Google is another rising cloud-computing player, though far behind Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nGoogle stock climbed 1.6% last week to 1,264.30, just below a 1,268.49 entry from a 26-week cup-with-handle base. The RS line for Google stock is at its best levels of the long handle.\n\nGoogle stock was highlighted in a recent \"Investing With IBD\" podcast as a top pick for growth and value investors.\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU ALSO MIGHT LIKE:\n\n5 Stocks With $1.8 Trillion Market Cap Are Near Buys\n\nThese 5 IBD 50 Stocks Are Just Below Buy Points\n\nIBD Stock Of The Day Nears Buy Point After 77% Run\n\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today", "description": "Dow Jones futures: The stock market rally is just below highs, while Apple stock faces a last test.
