We\u2019re selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun. Love BK. #justsaying\u201d.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFarage had previously been caked in milkshake in Newcastle.\n\n\u201cWe considered that the tweet was likely to be seen as a reference to the recent incidents of \u2018milkshaking\u2019 political figures,\u201d said the Advertising Standards Authority.\n\n\u201cWe considered that the ad condoned the previous antisocial behaviour and encouraged further instances.\n\n\"We therefore concluded the ad was irresponsible. We told Burger King to ensure that its future marketing communications did not condone or encourage antisocial behaviour.\u201d", "description": "The fast food giants say their employees in Folkstone, Kent, were wrong to tell Medina Hall that \"all customers had to read menus themselves\"", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464911.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0__109107930_de43.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
