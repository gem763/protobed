He\u2019s a really good guy, really fast, really talented. He knows Suzuka more than anyone else I think on the planet.\u201d\n\nThe thousands of spectators lining the circuit had plenty of chance to see their hero.\n\nThe 31-year-old reigning champion in Japan\u2019s Super Formula and Super GT series completed the joint-most number of laps in the session, along with Kimi Raikkonen of Alfa Romeo and Robert Kubica of Williams.\n\nYamamoto finished a creditable 17th fastest with a best lap of 1:32.018, less than a tenth of a second behind teammate Daniil Kvyat.", "description": "Suzuka (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Valtteri Bottas went quickest in first practice for the typhoon-hit Japanese Grand Prix on Friday, a whisker ahead of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/9e7e70_bottas-hamilton-quicker-ferraris-bottas-hamilton-set-early-pace-in-typhoon-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
