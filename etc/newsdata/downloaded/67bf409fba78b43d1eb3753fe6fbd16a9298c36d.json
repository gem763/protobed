He now wants to change things up.\n\nBean was famously beheaded in the first season of Game of Thrones, kicking off the show\u2019s long spree of killing main characters. He took arrows in the chest in 2001\u2019s Lord of the Rings, and he was crushed by burning metal in 1995\u2019s GoldenEye. As one meme put it, \u201cOne does not simply kill Sean Bean.. One must do some repeatedly.\u201d\n\nTurns out Sean Bean knows this, and has started turnings down roles where he dies, \u201cOtherwise it was all a bit predictable.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Sun, published on Thursday, Bean said, \u201cI\u2019ve turned down stuff. I\u2019ve said, \u2018They know my character\u2019s going to die because I\u2019m in it!\u2019\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

A 2011 YouTube video titled \u201cSean Bean Death Reel\u201d has over 2,600,000 views.\n\nBean said he was initially comfortable with his Game of Thrones character Ned Stark getting killed, because he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to get stuck in one of these series that lasts seven years.\u201d\n\nBut, since the show has been such a global hit, Bean added, \u201cBut I wish I\u2019d have got stuck now. But it was very clear what [Game of Thrones author] George R.R. Martin wanted to happen to Ned \u2014 and it did.\u201d\n\nBean makes it out alive in his upcoming project, the drama World On Fire, which premieres Sept. 29.\n\nWrite to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com.", "description": "If you're a fan of the English actor Sean Bean, chances are you've seen him horrifically die on screen.
