And we've heard hundreds of stories where good Samaritans have gone that extra mile to provide for the less fortunate. Likewise, Manipur-based June Rose Vaphie is showing the world how even a small business can help those in need.\n\nAccording to a ANI report, June Rose Vaphie is a social worker and a successful entrepreneur who is working for the cause of educating children from humble backgrounds through her business of soap making.\n\nANI\n\nShe started her venture of organic soaps in the year 2017 and since then she has been flourishing.\n\n\"The main reason why I started soap-making is commercial soap is not good for my skin. When I look at the content of the soaps there are so many chemicals, so I started thinking if there can be soaps without that many chemicals and which will be good for my skin,\" said June Rose Vaphie.\n\nJune uses her innovative ideas of making soaps from natural oil extracts, extracts of fruits, and herbs like lemon, rose, and aloe vera. She says that these herbs and fruits have positive benefits on health and nourishes the skin, reports ANI.\n\nShe makes varieties of soaps of different shapes, sizes, and fragrances under the brand name 'Luxury Soothe handmade soaps'.\n\nDon't Miss 13.3 K SHARES 13.2 K SHARES 3.6 K SHARES 4.7 K SHARES 4.1 K SHARES\n\nInstagram/Picture For Representation\n\nJune's untiring efforts of making soaps have earned her recognition. She used social media platforms to advertise her products and reach out to people which brought her enormous popularity. Whatever little she earns from her business goes in helping orphans who don't have access to education.\n\nJune said, \"I see lots of poor intelligent people especially children who cannot go to schools whose parents cannot afford their education. I am doing my bit with my own pocket money in helping those children for their education.\"\n\nVaiphei began her schooling at Standard English School and graduated from GP Women College in English in the year 1989. Since then, she always had an inclination towards working for the welfare and betterment of the society, especially women.\n\nReuters/Picture for representation\n\nHer hard work and perseverance in every avenue led her to become a member of the State Women Commission, during which she came across several downtrodden families and children who were deprived of their rights. \"I started this initiative last year in the month of September.\"\n\nThe responses and feedback are quite good so far because there are people who have got sensitive skin, pigmentation problem and they say the soaps are quite soothing for their skin.\n\nThe initial investment is around 1-2 lakhs but I keep on procuring the raw materials, additives so I would say I haven't really started making much profit,\" added June. Her organic soaps are non-toxic, beautiful to look at, and smell heavenly and are sold in the market at the cost of Rs 150 to Rs 250 per piece.\n\nAGENCY ANI", "description": "In a similar way, a woman named June from Manipur is showing the world, even a small business can help those in dire straits.
