The love tends to get in the way of the objectivity and vice versa.\n\nDavid Maraniss \u2014 a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and best-selling biographer of subjects as varied as Bill Clinton and Vince Lombardi, Barack Obama and Roberto Clemente \u2014 makes a gallant effort to be both loving and objective in \u201cA Good American Family.\u201d For the most part, he succeeds admirably, but there is a yawning chasm at the center of his father\u2019s story that he never quite manages to bridge, perhaps because it is unbridgeable.\n\nAccording to his son, Elliott Maraniss was \u201ca newspaperman first and foremost, with a keen appreciation for human foibles. He was generous with money, affection, encouragement, and the benefit of the doubt. He seemed tolerant of almost everything but intolerance \u2026 It is hard for me to overstate how much of a force for good he was not only in my life and those of his siblings, but also in the lives of scores of newspaper people, professional acquaintances, and friends of the family who were heartened and encouraged by his intuitive intelligence and positive nature over many decades.\u201d\n\nBut, and this is a big \u201cbut,\u201d his son adds that, \u201cthere was a time when Elliott Maraniss was a communist. I say this without hesitation, without shame or pride. There are aspects of his thinking during that period that I can\u2019t reconcile, and will never reconcile, as hard as I try to figure them out and as much of a trail as he left for me through his writings. I can appreciate his motivations, but I am confounded by his reasoning and his choices \u2026 among other indefensible positions, how could he buy the Soviet line after the 1939 Nonagression Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany?\u201d\n\nHe concedes that, \u201cfor an extended period of his young life\u201d his father was \u201cnaively in the service to rigid ideology, to the God that failed, as the title of a powerful book of essays by former communists put it. Perhaps he was even blinded by love, though I find it inadequate to attribute his involvement with communism to an attempt to please my mother, Mary Cummins Maraniss, who with her older siblings was a young communist long before meeting him.\u201d\n\nIn his attempt to reach a balanced verdict on his father, David Maraniss concedes that he \u201cwas not falsely accused\u201d but follows up with a rhetorical question: \u201c[D]idn\u2019t being a citizen of this country give him the freedom to affiliate with the politics of his choosing and to write and speak his mind, as long as he didn\u2019t betray his country as a foreign agent?\u201d\n\nThere is no simple answer to this seemingly simple question. Pushing the party line in Communist publications which we now know were subsidized and supervised by Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union was certainly not an act of espionage per se. Nor did Elliott Maraniss\u2019 congressional interrogators ever claim it was. It did, however, mean joining an organized Stalinist effort seeking to undermine American democracy.\n\nElliott Maraniss never stood trial for anything. But when, at the height of the Cold War, he refused to testify about his Communist links, he undermined his own credibility as a journalist and a citizen. In the author\u2019s words, both of his parents had \u201clatched on to a false promise and for too long blinded themselves to the repressive totalitarian reality of communism in the Soviet Union. And now they were paying the price.\u201d\n\nFortunately for them, the \u201cprice\u201d they had to pay was comparatively light. No jail, no starvation, no gulag, no bullet in the back of the head. Instead, a brief series of career setbacks \u2014 most major American publications were understandably reluctant to hire a writer who was on record as an unrepentant communist \u2014 that meant frequent moves and a tight family budget in the 1950s. This didn\u2019t stop the kids from getting good educations and excelling in their own right, and Elliott himself eventually found a lasting journalistic haven in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I would have enjoyed knowing him. But, at the end of the day, I think I would still consider Elliott Maraniss an unanswered riddle, a man who \u2014 whether he realized it or not \u2014 was at least as wrong as he was wronged.\n\n\u2022 Aram Bakshian Jr., a former aide to Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, has written widely on politics, history, gastronomy and the arts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nA GOOD AMERICAN FAMILY: THE RED SCARE AND MY FATHER\n\nBy David Maraniss\n\nSimon & Schuster, $28, 416 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
