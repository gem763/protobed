For the uninitiated, the rough rule of thumb with these beasts is a cost of \u20ac1 million per metre so you can pencil in \u20ac73 million ($109.8 million) for Aussie John's new toy. Thank you very much Ian Narev, who still has the final 20 per cent of Aussie Home Loans to mop up in the coming months, which would just about cover it.\n\nThe new vessel has been named Hasna, Arabic for \"beautiful one\". We doubt the big man thunk up the name while admiring himself in the shower one morning. After its sea trials, the dream boat should be docked off Monaco just in time for Symond's 70th birthday in August.\n\nAussie John Symond's new superyacht, Hasna, launched overnight at Feadship's yard in Kaag, the Netherlands. Feadship\n\nAt 73 metres, she's just one metre shorter than Brett Blundy's CRN-built Cloud 9 (the second of its name). The next big launch will be James Packer's, though there's no certainty the divesting casino billionaire still has any appetite for a floating entertainment complex.\n\nHasna has six double cabins, room for 21 staff, a cinema, 25-metre sun deck and a butler's cabin just perfect for yours truly. But don't ever expect to see her in Sydney Harbour. There's no way \"Aussie\" John, soon to be a tax resident of elsewhere, will let the Commissioner sting him for GST on such a whopping purchase.", "description": "Aussie John Symond has a new 73-metre toy, just in time for his 70th birthday party in Monaco.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.6395%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1251%2C$x_82%2C$y_252/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/520b43d2899a95e7cf6a182b2c281c6ffa100ce4", "published_at": "2017-06-06"}
