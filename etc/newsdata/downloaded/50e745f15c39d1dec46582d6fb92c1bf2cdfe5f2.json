(AP) - Wildlife officials in central Minnesota are discovering it\u2019s not easy to get rid of deer carcasses infected with chronic wasting disease.\n\nMinnesota has been wrestling with the disease since 2016, when it was first confirmed in wild herds in the southeastern corner of the state. This year, the ailment was confirmed in a wild deer in Crow Wing County north of the Twin Cities, the first case outside of the state\u2019s southeastern region. Now every deer shot within a 13-mile radius must be tested.\n\nThe discovery has created myriad questions about what the county should do with infected carcasses.\n\nLegislators have set aside $50,000 to set up dumpsters. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is supposed to empty the dumpsters and take the carcasses to landfills.\n\nBut Minnesota Public Radio reports that Marv Stroschein, the Crow Wing County landfill manager, refused to accept any infected deer. He said he\u2019s worried prions could seep out of the carcasses and infect the surrounding soil and eventually more animals. Prions are deformed proteins in deer\u2019s brains that cause chronic wasting disease.\n\nThe Department of Natural Resources looked into trucking Crow Wing County carcasses to a landfill in an adjoining county, but officials there were hesitant about accepting them after Stroschein refused to take them.\n\nMichelle Carstensen, the department\u2019s wildlife health group leader who is in charge of transporting carcasses from dumpsters to landfills, told the radio network that she was afraid Minnesota would end up like Wisconsin, where only 13 landfills accept deer waste.\n\nDan Kroll, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources\u2019 solid waste coordinator, said landfills are afraid of being held liable for escaped prions.\n\nKroll said hunters in some areas now must drive 80 miles to get rid of their deer bones and many simply toss the bodies in ditches or smuggle them into prohibited landfills disguised as household trash.\n\nWeeks before Minnesota\u2019s bow season began last month, Carstensen of the Minnesota DNR offered Stroschein a 15-year-old incinerator to burn the carcasses. Stroschein accepted, although he told MPR that his workers had difficulty lighting the incinerator.\n\nMichael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told the radio network that incinerators are too inefficient to serve as a large-scale solution for dealing with thousands of infected or potentially infected carcasses.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to landfills and carcass disposal, scalability is a huge issue that needs to be addressed,\u201d Osterholm said.\n\nChronic wasting disease attacks deer\u2019s brains, causing them to grow thin and act strangely before killing them. Nothing suggests the disease can infect humans, although experts worry it could eventually jump the species barrier like mad cow disease.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wildlife officials in central Minnesota are discovering it's not easy to get rid of deer carcasses infected with chronic wasting disease.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
