The products contained THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\nPrior to the suspension, buyers could easily purchase devices, component parts and packaging from sites like Alibaba or Amazon to make their own counterfeit vaping devices.\n\nAmazon.com Inc took down vape paraphernalia in September, although it did not specify the exact products it removed.\n\n(Reporting by Josh Horwitz in Shanghai; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Richard Pullin)", "description": "(Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba said on Wednesday it will stop selling e-cigarette components in the United States, amid growing regulatory scrutiny and reports of lung disease and some deaths linked to vaping.", "authors": ["Josh Horwitz"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
