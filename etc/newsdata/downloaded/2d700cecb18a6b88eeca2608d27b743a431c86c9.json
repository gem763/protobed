The Downing Street insider said that Ireland and Germany are most likely to block the deal. He added: \u201cThose who think [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel will help us are deluded.\u201d\n\nJust this morning, a Downing Street source said the German chancellor had indicated that a Brexit deal is \u201coverwhelmingly unlikely\u201d. They said the message was that the UK could not come out of the EU \u201cwithout leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment forever\u201d.\n\nThe Spectator source said that Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, \u201cwants to gamble on a second referendum\u201d and is \u201cencouraging Barnier to stick to the line that the UK cannot leave the EU without leaving Northern Ireland behind\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf this deal dies in the next few days, then it won\u2019t be revived,\u201d the source stated. He also explained that Number 10 is taking legal advice on getting around the Benn Act which forces the prime minister to ask for a Brexit extension to stop a clean break.\n\nAn extension of Article 50 can only be approved unanimously by the EU-27, and the source made clear that supporting a delay would be viewed as \u201chostile interference in domestic politics\u201d. Those countries that reject an extension \u201cwill go the front of the queue for future cooperation\u201d post-Brexit, while those \u201cwho support delay will go to the bottom of the queue\u201d.\n\nJog On, Jolyon: Court Dismisses Latest Anti-Brexit Challenge https://t.co/5dCGIvunjR \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 7, 2019\n\nHowever, the high-level source could not rule out that there would be an extension to Article 50 to January 31st, 2020, but said that such a delay would be \u201ctotally pointless\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals. This won\u2019t happen. We\u2019ll either leave with no deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with no deal,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cAny delay will in effect be negotiated between you, Parliament, and the courts \u2014 we will wash our hands of it, we won\u2019t engage in further talks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will focus on winning the election on a manifesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave,\u201d the source said, adding that anti-Brexit campaigners and Remainer MPs will only succeed in \u201cuniting the leave vote\u201d and helping the Tories win the election, leading to \u201ca no-deal Brexit. History is full of such ironies and tragedies.\u201d\n\nWhile he predicts that the Remainers\u2019 sabotage will only work to galvanise Leavers, a ComRes survey for The Telegraph revealed that the public would blame Parliament, Remainer MPs, and Brussels more than the prime minister if there is another Brexit delay.\n\nRecent polling from Opinium for the Observer gave the Conservatives a 15-point lead over Labour. The Tories gained two points, taking them to 38 per cent, since party conference season, while the Remain-backing Labour is on 23 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 15 per cent.", "description": "A Number 10 source has said that even if there is a delay or a general election, there will be a no-deal, clean-break Brexit.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/PM-BJohnson-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
