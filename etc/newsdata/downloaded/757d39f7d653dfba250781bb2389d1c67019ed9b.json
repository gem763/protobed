He remained in North Korean custody until June 2017, when he was returned to the U.S. in a comatose state and died within days. He was 22.\n\nThe Warmbiers have blamed their son\u2019s death on Kim Jong Un, the autocratic leader of North Korea whose brutal regime remains subject to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others for various blatant violations of international law.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters after meeting with the North Korean leader that he did not believe he was personally responsible for the student\u2019s death, however.\n\n\u201cHe felt badly about it,\u201d Mr. Trump said after they spoke during a summit held in February in Hanoi. \u201cHe felt very badly. Some really bad things happened to Otto \u2014 some really, really bad things. But he tells me that he didn\u2019t know about it, and I will take him at his word.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear how the White House dinner was arranged or if anyone else will attend, CNN reported.\n\nMr. Grenell, the ambassador, met with the Warmbiers when they visited Germany in August and subsequently posted about it on social media.\n\n\u201cCindy is focused on bringing some justice to her family \u2014 and we are ready to help,\u201d Mr. Grenell wrote on Instagram after meeting Mrs. Warmbier.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
