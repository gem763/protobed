The 25-year-old, wearing a grey sweatshirt, spoke only to confirm his name, address and British nationality.\n\nRobinson faces 43 charges in all - 39 counts of manslaughter as well as accusations of conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering.\n\n\u201cThis involves a global ring facilitating the movement of a large number of immigrants into the UK,\u201d prosecution lawyer Ogheneruona Mercy Iguyovwe told the court. She said other suspects were still being sought.\n\nRobinson did not apply for bail. He was remanded in custody until Nov. 25, when the case will continue at the Old Bailey, London\u2019s Central Criminal Court, and he will enter a plea.\n\nHe was arrested shortly after the bodies were found near the English port of Purfleet. The shipping container they were in had travelled from Zeebrugge in Belgium.\n\n\u2018HOPING FOR A BETTER LIFE\u2019\n\n\u201cThe whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by this tragedy, and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country,\u201d British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote in a book of condolences.\n\nInterior minister Priti Patel told parliament the investigation would unravel \u201ccriminality that could stretch half way across the world\u201d.\n\nMany of the dead appear to have come from Vietnam\u2019s northern rice-growing areas of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of its poorest provinces.\n\n\u201cIf I could travel back in time, I wouldn\u2019t have let him go this way,\u201d said Hoang Thi Ai, mother of Hoang Van Tiep, 18, who is feared to be among the dead. \u201cI clean his room every day with the hope that he wasn\u2019t in that deadly truck.\u201d\n\nPolice have said few of the victims were carrying official identification, and that they are resorting to fingerprints, dental records, DNA and photographs from friends and relatives.\n\nVietnam said Britain had sent dossiers seeking help in identifying four of the bodies.\n\nPolice officers stand outside Chelmsford Magistrates' Court, in Chelmsford, Britain October 28, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son said Vietnam was still unable to confirm the nationality of any of the victims.\n\n\u2018MY CHILD WAS SCAMMED\u2019\n\nBui Thi Nhung, 19, is believed by her family to be one of the dead.\n\nThey said she had left Nghe An in August, making her way from China to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she entered the container.\n\nAbout 70 percent of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britain between 2009 and 2016 were for labour exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, Britain said last year.\n\nA report last March by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation, identified Nghe An as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe.\n\nThe other province, Ha Tinh, was ravaged in 2016 by one of Vietnam\u2019s worst environmental disasters when a steel mill owned by Taiwan\u2019s Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating fishing and tourism.\n\nTiep\u2019s mother said she believed her son had been tricked into travelling to Britain, since he had made it to France when he was 16 and settled down.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n\u201cOne day he hastily asked us to raise 100 million dong ($4,300) for his trip,\u201d Ai said, sitting with family members in their house in Dien Chau district of Nghe An province.\n\n\u201cMy child was scammed. The guy who helped him organise the journey to the UK said the \u2018VIP\u2019 service was very safe, commuting in four-seat car - not that container.\u201d", "description": "A court heard on Monday that a global ring had been involved in smuggling the 39 people whose bodies were found in a truck near London, as the driver faced charges of manslaughter and people-trafficking.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445824061&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0TW", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
