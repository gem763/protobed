They are the areas that really hurt us in the end, but not a lack of effort.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cDefensively we were very good I thought. We just need to pick up a bit with our patience and discipline with the football.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a quality football team with a lot of quality players in that team, and I don\u2019t think and of us, in the Australian comp certainly, doubted that we would have a tough game. It proved to be that, and they had a bit of luck as well.\n\n\u201cI noticed in the 9s last week there were a couple of things that put us under pressure and I didn\u2019t like that. I thought we\u2019d got that out of our game last year and the year before - we need to get that right again.\n\n\u201cWhat you saw in the first half tonight is what you\u2019ve got to be able to play week-in and week-out. They had one handling error and one penalty against them in the first half. If we can\u2019t do that we can\u2019t be the team I know we want to be.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t far off that first half by the way, we were pretty close to that mark. But that\u2019s the standard.\u201d\n\nAsked who impressed him in the Lions side, Bennett responded: \u201cJohn Bateman really came into his own in the second half there a fair bit, but outside of that I wasn\u2019t that excited abut anyone else. It wasn\u2019t a lack of effort and they were up against it at times when we weren\u2019t kicking great.\n\n\u201cSecond half we turned the ball over in vital field positions at different stages when we had them under pressure, and we gave away three seven-tackle sets. Stuff like that takes away your energy to do anything with the football because you spend too much time defending.\u201d\n\nOn the injuries to Thompson and Gildart, Bennett added: \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll probably play again this series. Thompson has a rib issue and Gildart a dislocated shoulder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with the squad, we can cover. We\u2019ve got the best players in England here so at the moment it\u2019s not panic time for us.\u201d", "description": "Luke Thompson and Oliver Gildart could miss the remainder of the tour with injury", "authors": ["Julie Stott", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728449.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Great-Britain-Lions-v-Mate-Maa-Tonga.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
