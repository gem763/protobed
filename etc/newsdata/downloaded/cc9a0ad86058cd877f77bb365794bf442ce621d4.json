We ranked Hollywood\u2019s other famous steps.", "language": "en", "text": "Certain film locations are iconic before camera crews roll in to shoot a movie. But sometimes a movie scene is powerful enough to catapult an otherwise unremarkable site into fame overnight.\n\nThe most recent example comes thanks to \u201cJoker,\u201d starring Joaquin Phoenix. In one of its highlight moments, Phoenix dances down a stretch of steps like a twitchy Radio City Rockettes reject. The stairs are a functional part of New York City\u2019s Bronx borough, but thanks to the movie, they\u2019ve grown into a tourist phenomenon.\n\nThe \u201cJoker\u201d stairs aren\u2019t the first everyday set of stairs to become a travel destination. And they won\u2019t be the last. Here are the most iconic stair, stoop and step scenes, ranked from worst to best, according to whatever is the opposite of rigorous science.\n\n[The best 1-star reviews of the Seven Wonders of the World]\n\nOf all the movie-famous stairs, the \u201cJoker\u201d set, off Shakespeare Avenue, rank the lowest on our list for a number of reasons. For starters, they\u2019re too new to be truly iconic. Secondly, the steps\u2019 newfound popularity is a bad match for what visitors are trying to achieve. Fans flock there to get that same razzle-dazzle of Phoenix\u2019s lone dance, captured in a photo. But the stairs run steep, and there are a lot of people around, ruining the lone-wolf vibe.\n\n\n\nVisitors pose and take selfies on the staircase in the Bronx, made famous by the movie \"Joker.\" (Don Emmert/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe Exelon Plaza in Chicago is being docked points because, unlike some of the other iconic steps in this list, you can\u2019t re-create the same feeling conveyed in the movie that made them famous. How could you? These steps, immortalized by the monumental parade scene of \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d spend most of their time parade-less.\n\n[A local\u2019s guide to Chicago]\n\nTheoretically, you could stage a flash mob there if you gathered enough volunteers with adequate dance abilities, but who\u2019s got the time? Spend your day off somewhere else.\n\nReplicate the magic of Audrey Hepburn meeting Gregory Peck in \u201cRoman Holiday\u201d by throwing on a cool outfit, grabbing a gelato, and absolutely not sitting down like the many people featured in the scene.\n\n\n\nA tourist poses on the Spanish Steps in.

These steps would rank a lot higher on the list if it weren\u2019t for the fact that they\u2019re plagued by overtourism.\n\n[A local's guide to Rome]\n\nThe stairs featured in the 1973 thriller \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d have become a landmark destination in the nation\u2019s capital. Nearly 50 years since the film\u2019s release, the stairs, in the Georgetown neighborhood, are now ranked No. 91 of 462 things to do in Washington, according to TripAdvisor.\n\n\n\nTourists take a selfie at the bottom of the stairs made famous by the 1973 movie \"The Exorcist\" in Georgetown (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n[A local\u2019s guide to Washington, D.C.]\n\nOn that guide site, they earned such reviews as \u201cCreepy Steps\u201d and \u201cWorth the Stop.\u201d Take a peek and a picture and get back to exploring the rest of the District of Columbia\u2019s old-timey \u2014 and sometimes eerie \u2014 charm.\n\nEven if you\u2019ve never seen the heartwarming 1965 musical \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d you\u2019ve probably heard its feature songs. One of those is \u201cDo-Re-Me.\u201d Julie Andrew is shown singing the menacingly catchy number in multiple locations, but it\u2019s during her belting of the tune in Mirabell Gardens in Salzburg, Austria, that we\u2019re referencing. Because, stairs.\n\n\n\nMonica Rodman at Mirabell Gardens. (Monica Rodman/The Washington Post)\n\nToday, tourists visit the steps for a photo op, arms spread wide open a la Andrews, likely with that song stuck in their heads. Due to the fact that the Mirabell Gardens are so beautiful and majestic they\u2019re worth a visit on their own, we highly recommend a stop here.\n\nFor those who missed the early aughts, \u201cSex and the City\u201d is a blockbuster rom-com series (which also spawned a set of movies) about sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker). Carrie\u2019s brownstone, filmed at 64 Perry St., in Greenwich Village, is now a mecca for any fan making a pilgrimage to Manhattan.\n\n\n\nA group of friends outside Carrie Bradshaw's apartment.

Pay homage to Carrie by waxing poetic about your failed relationships via internal monologue, then go get a cocktail at one of the many great bars nearby.\n\nSure, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is not a movie. But the HBO series cost more to make than most movies, and was viewed more than most movies, so it makes the cut for this list. The series turned many places into tourist destinations, but the so-called Jesuit Staircase in Dubrovnik stands out as a highlight.\n\n\n\nGuide Ivan Vukovic, who spends half of his time leading tours of a capital that doesn't exist -- the fictional King's Landing from \"Game of Thrones\", poses on the Dubrovnik's baroque Jesuit staircase.

In the Season Five finale, Cersei Lannister makes a harrowing \u201cwalk of penance\u201d down the steps, which, in real life, are a lot easier to appreciate than in that painful-to-watch scene. Take the walk of penance yourself with other GOT fans; you\u2019ll enjoy the tour through this medieval city more than Cersei did.\n\nThere are a ton of memorable moments from Sylvester Stallone\u2019s massively successful 1976 film \u201cRocky,\u201d but the one that became a tourist destination comes from the movie\u2019s hyper-macho, incredibly epic training montage. To the tune of the now-immortal song \u201cGonna Fly Now,\u201d we watch Sly bound through Philadelphia, ending with his ascent of the 72 steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It\u2019s not just the best stair scene in cinema \u2014 it\u2019s one of the best scenes in cinema.\n\n\n\nThe 'Rocky Steps' at The Philadelphia Museum of Art. (Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images)\n\n[A local\u2019s guide to Philadelphia]\n\nThe steps from \u201cRocky\u201d are our No. 1 pick because not only do visitors have the chance to pose with a bronze Rocky statue that\u2019s at the bottom, but there\u2019s also an art museum right there for you to peruse once you\u2019re done taking fist-pumping photos.\n\nRead more:\n\nCan tourism \u2018pledges\u2019 help keep visitors on their best behavior?\n\nA selfie ban in the Czech Republic is the latest effort to combat bad tourist behavior\n\nTell us what you think of By The Way", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix's routine is getting attention, but there are superior and more memorable staircases across the world to visit.", "authors": ["Natalie B.
