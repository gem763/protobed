He\u2019s always late. Always late,\u201d Stick said, tutting.\n\nStick, who was jokingly playing the role of disapproving schoolmaster, is four years younger than Brits, by the way.\n\nAt 38, Brits is the second-oldest Springboks player at a World Cup. He\u2019ll also be the second-oldest player to captain South Africa when he leads the team against Namibia at the Rugby World Cup on Saturday while regular skipper Siya Kolisi gets a rest and a seat on the bench.\n\nA lot has happened late for Brits, and the most enjoyable times of his 17-year pro rugby career appear to be right now, right at the end.\n\nBrits had retired from all rugby and was holidaying on the Spanish island of Ibiza last year - kicking back and sipping cocktails, he said - when the cellphone rang. It was new Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus and he wanted to know if Brits wanted to play for the Boks again.\n\nBrits hadn\u2019t played a test in three years. He was closer to 40 than 30. He even had a job lined up and a course at Cambridge University to prepare him for life after rugby. Everything was decided.\n\nAnd yet the answer to Erasmus\u2018 question was obvious, at least to Brits.\n\n\u201cIt was quite easy, to be honest. To represent your country is a massive honor and privilege,\u201d Brits said. \u201cI can always do an 8-5 job \u2026 but I can\u2019t always play.\u201d\n\nBrits\u2019 reply was a big yes. Luckily, the company that had already employed him was totally understanding of his decision.\n\nTheir response to the unexpected development, Brits said, was: \u201cif you start working at 37 or 38, it doesn\u2019t make a difference. So, go live your dream and we\u2019ll see you here later.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, so far, it\u2019s the best decision,\u201d Brits said.\n\nNow, Brits gets to captain the Springboks at a World Cup a year after he\u2019d decided to retire.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another late surprise.\n\nBrits, normally a hooker, will start at No. 8 against the Namibians in an unexpected move engineered by Erasmus to give him a little more space to rest his big backrow forwards ahead of the next game against Italy, a crucial one for the Springboks\u2019 quarterfinal hopes.\n\nErasmus said he hopes Brits at No. 8 - even at his age - gives the Boks a lot more speed across the field against a Namibia team that likes to play fast, open rugby. Brits has experience in the back row although he last played at No. 8 in Super Rugby a decade ago. But he\u2019s super-versatile and still quick for a front-rower.\n\nHe\u2019s also enthusiastic to the point of infectious and, possibly as important to the Boks, off the field as on it.\n\nThe \u201cjoker\u201d of the squad, according to Stick, Brits will have been one of the guys to help lift the players who were involved in the 23-13 loss to New Zealand last weekend.\n\n\u201cIt was quite nice to see that I could fit in with these younger players,\u201d he said. \u201cI still believe we can do wonders in this World Cup. We\u2019re a group that\u2019s learning and learning quickly.\u201d\n\nAnd Brits is happy to keep learning, even if his rugby career is a matter of weeks away from the end. Because you\u2019re never too old to learn. Or to play for the Springboks.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Schalk Brits was late for the pre-match news conference, leading to a chuckle from South Africa assistant coach Mzwandile Stick.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
