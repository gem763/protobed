First Harry Kane, from the penalty spot, and then Lucas Moura with a firecracker from distance cut through the bedlam whipped up by the Olympiakos diehards to put Spurs in charge.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t respect the plan\u2019: Pochettino disappointed with Tottenham draw Read more\n\nIt was a lead that flattered Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team and one they could not preserve in the face of a spirited Olympiakos performance and a wall of noise from the stands. Spurs have entered some hostile environments over the past five years under Pochettino but, in terms of decibel levels, nothing quite like this. From start to finish, there was a frenzy inside this single-tiered bowl, where the sound swirls without release.\n\nDaniel Podence, the most eye-catching player on display, damaged Spurs with an excellent finish just before half-time and Pochettino\u2019s team would cave in to concede the equaliser early in the second period. As passions raged in Spurs\u2019 defensive third, Jan Vertonghen went through the back of Mathieu Valbuena \u2013 a clumsy and needless foul. It felt as though the prickly heat of the moment had got the better of him. Valbuena picked himself up to beat his friend Hugo Lloris from the spot.\n\nThe idea from a Spurs point of view was that they would make a bold statement on the opening night of this Champions League group and avoid the edgy game of catch-up that defined their progress to the last 16 last season. It is sometimes overlooked that Spurs only qualified and went on to reach the final \u2013 which they lost against Liverpool \u2013 after Internazionale failed to beat PSV Eindhoven at San Siro on the final night of group matches.\n\nThis was not the worst result given that Olympiakos are an authentic European force on their own turf but it was a substandard performance, one that was undermined by a lack of aggression and intensity. Pochettino complained that his players did not respect his gameplan and, certainly, they afforded Olympiakos too much space, particularly in the first half.\n\n\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda double helps PSG ease to win against Real Madrid Read more\n\nIt is never a good look to lose a two\u2011goal lead and everyone at Spurs is conscious that Bayern Munich and Red Star Belgrade are still to come. The club\u2019s supporters must buckle up for another wild ride.\n\nPochettino wanted to fight fire with fire with his 4-2-3-1 starting system, in which Christian Eriksen pressed close to Kane; to carry the game to Olympiakos. It did not go to plan at the outset and there was the sight of the manager angrily gesticulating in his technical area as the hosts broke in the 18th minute. They went within inches of taking what would have been a deserved lead.\n\nKostas Tsimikas skipped around Harry Winks too easily to cross and Podence chested down for Miguel \u00c1ngel Guerrero. The striker\u2019s low shot beat Lloris only to come back off the far post and, on the rebound, Guilherme\u2019s shot bounced over the crossbar.\n\nOlympiakos called the tune for the opening quarter, with Podence getting into good areas off the right wing and it was difficult to recall Spurs entering the final third. They sorely lacked control. And yet, in what felt like the blink of an eye, everything changed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lucas Moura puts Spurs 2-0 up as a stunning shot from distance beats the Olympiakos goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1. Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/AP\n\nKane bundled past Yassine Meriah as he attacked the right-hand side of the area, getting the break of the ball and, in real time, it was difficult to see what had caused him to go to ground. The referee, Gianluca Rocchi, spotted it and his decision to point to the spot would be vindicated by the replays. Meriah had panicked and stretched back a leg, serving to trip Kane. The striker coolly scooped his penalty up the middle and into the roof of the net.\n\nIlkay G\u00fcndogan lights up Manchester City\u2019s easy win over Shakhtar Donetsk Read more\n\nOlympiakos were reeling and they caught the second part of the sucker combination punch moments later. Ben Davies, on his first start of the season, stepped up to win the ball high in the Olympiakos half and when he fed Moura, the Brazilian fizzed an unstoppable drive past Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1.\n\nHow Spurs needed to reach half\u2011time at 2-0. They could not do so. Giorgos Masouras had fluffed a volley when well placed on 34 minutes but Olympiakos were rewarded for their front-foot football when Podence swapped passes with Valbuena, surged into the area and shot low into the far corner. The pace and the precision of the exchange was too much for the Spurs defence.\n\nThe visitors needed to show composure but at the first sign of pressure around their area in the second half, they cracked. They could not clear their lines and it was Vertonghen who got too close to the back of Valbuena, treading on his foot to send him over.\n\nThe game descended into an end-to-end power struggle and Spurs did have the chances to win it as they finished as the stronger team. Dele Alli, who had a goal ruled out for offside in the 49th minute, caught a break to burst through only for S\u00e1 to tip his shot around the post while the substitute, \u00c9rik Lamela, also worked the goalkeeper. Spurs deserved no more than the point.", "description": "Spurs were forced to settle for a 2-2 draw in their opening Champions League match at Olympiakos, who recovered to gain a point after going two behind to goals by Harry Kane and Lucas Moura", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ac49a52f6a3bd1dbf3b834188f4ebfc62ac169f/52_251_2317_1390/master/2317.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f4f37c7436b01b33cdf75f06aec0c3be", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
