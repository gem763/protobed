The last time it was raised in 2014, a last-minute buying spree and a subsequent pullback in demand caused a big downward swing in consumer spending.", "description": "Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday that there was no immediate need to compile stimulus measures to counter the impact of a national sales tax hike, which took effect this week.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436857876&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9302R", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
