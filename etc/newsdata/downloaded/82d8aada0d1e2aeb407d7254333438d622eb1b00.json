The British monarch remains politically neutral and the incoming Prime Minister visits the Palace to satisfy the Queen that they can form her government by being able to command a majority, holding the greater number of seats, in Parliament. Then the Court Circular records that a new Prime Minister has been appointed.

The five-week suspension is also one of the longest shutdowns in decades.", "description": "U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has denied lying to Queen Elizabeth over the reasons for suspending parliament for five weeks in the run up to the Brexit deadline.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106125740-1568285016551gettyimages-1157536177.jpeg?v=1568285037", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
