The US has increased sanctions on Iran since unilaterally withdrawing from the nuclear deal in 2018.\n\nThe president has previously said that US and Saudi investigators were trying to determine whether Iran was responsible.\n\nOn Monday he said: \"Well, it's looking that way. We\u2019ll have some pretty good -- we\u2019re having some very strong studies done, but it\u2019s certainly looking that way at this moment. And we\u2019ll let you know. As soon as we find out definitively, we\u2019ll let you know. But it does look that way.\"\n\nAsked about whether military action was possible, he insisted that he did not want to go to war but added: \"I don\u2019t want war with anybody. But we\u2019re prepared more than anybody.\"\n\nIran responded by saying it would retaliate \"immediately\" to any attack.\n\nMore follows\u2026\n\n\n\n", "description": "Donald Trump has announced by tweet that he is increasing sanctions on Iran, following the weekend attacks on Saudi oil installations.The president tweeted: \"I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!\"", "authors": ["Phil Thomas"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kmV98lk.T15Lm0qmdsslqA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/73d8aebb6e8eb62fbd58bdb39ea760cc", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
