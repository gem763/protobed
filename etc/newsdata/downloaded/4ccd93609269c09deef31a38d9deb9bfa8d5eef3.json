Four? None? According to a new poll, 22 percent of millennials say they have \u201cno friends\u201d at all. (Nine percent of baby boomers, by comparison, report having no friends.)\n\nIt\u2019s sort of a strange poll, though, because it also revealed that 25 percent of millennials also claim to have \u201cno acquaintances,\u201d which at first seemed a little dark but then began to seem almost impressive. How do you manage that? The poll, conducted by the data collection company YouGov, included answers from 1,254 adult Americans, and I\u2019m guessing that people either got caught up in the emo-ness of answering in the loneliest way possible, or figured \u201cacquaintance\u201d meant something marginally more intimate, given its proximity to \u201cfriends,\u201d \u201cclose friends,\u201d and \u201cbest friends.\u201d But \u2026 still?\n\nThe poll of course also makes me wonder how many friends I have. Too many? Not enough? Compared to other millennials (half of whom report having between one and four close friends), I\u2019m more or less straight down the middle, with at least a dozen friends, a few close friends, and thousands of acquaintances. (Seriously, what on earth? Acquaintance: \u201ca person whom one knows but who is not a particularly close friend.\u201d Acquaintance: \u201cperson whom you know but do not know well.\u201d)\n\nThirty percent of millennials also said they \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d feel lonely, whereas 15 percent of baby boomers reported feeling that way. Rather than be too depressing, though, the news of millennial loneliness is supposedly mitigated by the fact that early adulthood is a notoriously lonely time, or at least it was in the \u201990s, too. Nevertheless, as Vox asks, \u201cWhat will happen to millennials, who are already reporting high levels of loneliness, when they reach old age?\u201d I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s what babies are for, right? Right?\n\nRight?", "description": "In a new poll, 22 percent of millennials claim to have \u201cno friends.\u201d (A quarter of millennials, meanwhile, claimed to have \u201cno acquaintances.\u201d) Thirty percent of millennials also claimed to be \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d lonely.
