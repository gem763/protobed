We\u2019ll have Peter Wehner, from the Ethics and Public Policy Center and author of The Death of Politics (which is more hopeful than the title may sound), Michael Wear, author of Reclaiming Hope, and Kristen Hanson whose life is a testament to hope. Get a taste of the panelists here here and here and in these videos for for Kristen and our fourth panelist thanks to videos, J.J. Hanson:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRSVP for Monday here.\n\nFor other NRI events at The Sheen Center this fall, see here.\n\n1.
