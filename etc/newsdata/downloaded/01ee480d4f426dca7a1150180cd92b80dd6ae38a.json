He's got a great character and he doesn't go out there to do that to anybody,\" Samoa coach Steve Jackson said.\n\n\"Hopefully the powers that be see some sense and hopefully he gets to continue on in this tournament.\"", "description": "Irish centre Bundee Aki has been banned for three-weeks after receiving a straight red card in a match against Samoa last week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9470/28a3159f696b45bcac733e2c6c8a282d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
