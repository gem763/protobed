Hundreds of organizations have put in thousands of hours in preparation for this event, which has been featured on billboards around the city.\n\nBut deep in the heart of Texas, not all of us are thrilled to see Modi and Trump in our backyard. Both leaders have stoked divisions within their respective countries, and enacted troubling policies that chip away at democracy. And as tempting as it might be to celebrate \"Howdy Modi\" as a moment for the Indian American community to be seen, heard and recognized as a rising political force in the US, we're worried that it comes at a cost that is far too high. We can't afford to ignore the pernicious impact that President Trump's words and policies have had on immigrants and communities of color.\n\nAs native Houstonians of South Asian descent, there is a huge sense of pride in what our community has been able to accomplish. From CEOs to engineers, astronauts, artists, and taxi drivers, we have firmly established our roots in all facets of this country. Houston has afforded us the opportunity to thrive and succeed. With success, however, comes a responsibility to give back. It also means using our voices to speak out in the face of injustice, whether it's the detention of migrant children in our own state or the lack of basic rights ethnic and religious minorities have in our ancestral country.", "description": "Deep in the heart of Texas, not all of us are thrilled to see Modi and Trump in our backyard, write Swati Narayan and Manpreet K.
