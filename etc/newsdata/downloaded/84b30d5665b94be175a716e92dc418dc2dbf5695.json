Keating says he is surprised how 'threadbare' the Coalition's agenda is, saying they have no vision of where Australia fits in the world. All they have to offer is 'trickle-down economics and a tax cut five years away', he says. On climate change, Keating says the world will stop using fossil fuels, adding, 'Here's the prime minister walking around with a lump of coal, coal is a fossil and the problem is the prime minister is a fossil himself. He's a fossil with a baseball cap but he's a fossil.' He denounces the Liberal party's commitment to supporting coal, saying, 'They're living in the past, they're policy deadbeats'", "description": "The former Labor prime minister denounces the Liberal party's commitment to coal and says: 'Here's the prime minister walking around with a lump of coal, coal is a fossil and the problem is the prime minister is a fossil himself'", "authors": ["Source"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e34520ee6c1ca24767affdfc0df410b7b29aad6/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=853bf8f0c4c3b06f37e7bc2c99ee3dd5", "published_at": "2019-05-06"}
