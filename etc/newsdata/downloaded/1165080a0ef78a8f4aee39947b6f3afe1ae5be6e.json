Senua, a warrior struggling with psychosis, must not only overcome physical challenges, but also those presented by her mind. The award-winning game was a hit. But it also proved to the team that there was a place, as well as a need, for more games that carefully represented mental health.\n\nNinja Theory is working on a new venture, called The Insight Project, to do just that. The team will use tech, game design, and clinical neuroscience to work on new methods of therapy for mental disorders. In an interview with The Verge, Ninja Theory co-founder Tameem Antoniades called the undertaking a continuation of the collaborative work the studio did with neuroscientists and mental health professionals on Hellblade. \u201cWith Microsoft acquiring us, it\u2019s taken off a lot of pressure from us as a studio,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we stopped developing games for other people, you know, work-for-hire games, which meant we have the opportunity to start entirely new projects.\u201d\n\nNinja Theory\u2019s representation of psychosis \u2014 in which someone loses touch with their external reality \u2014 translated to Hellblade\u2019s heroine, Senua, hearing voices or seeing things that aren\u2019t really there. Building off of its partnership with health research foundation Wellcome Trust, Antoniades says The Insight Project is \u201csort of like a hypothesis that video game technology could help make things that have previously been invisible, visible.\u201d That, in turn, opens those conditions up to diagnosis, analysis, and treatment, he adds.\n\nFor something like anxiety, for example, there are often physical symptoms. An anxious person likely experiences symptoms such as a racing heart, sweaty palms, or a feeling of unease. Paul Fletcher, a professor of neuroscience at Cambridge University who worked closely with Ninja Theory on Hellblade, says that biometric data on these mental health disorders could then be represented on-screen in simple ways, like a stormy sea. \u201cYou\u2019re on a boat and in order to successfully navigate towards a target, you need to keep the sea as calm as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cThen what that would actually entail is keeping a control over your physiological state \u2014 so learning how you could keep a lid on those physical aspects of the emotion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe aim of this is not to throw out the old therapies.\u201d\n\nThe key thing to remember is that if the game is immersive enough, people will want to do it for their own pleasure. \u201cIt\u2019s not a chore or homework that they need to do,\u201d says Fletcher. \u201cIt\u2019s not an assignment from their therapist, but rather it\u2019s something they actively want to participate in, then you\u2019re going to get a lot more buy-in from people, and they\u2019ll be much more willing to participate and therefore much more likely to be able to make substantial changes in themselves.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Fletcher says the goal is to give people additional ways of controlling or mitigating things like anxiety. \u201cThe aim of this is not to throw out the old therapies or to supersede them,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a good tool box of psychological and psychiatric therapies that can be used. But we think that combining the science, the clinic, the clinical work, and the talents of the gaming technology could actually produce some synergy and allow some of those therapeutic approaches to be used in very innovative and possibly more effective ways.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Hellblade\u2019s success that encouraged Ninja Theory to be more daring and tackle projects that could have real impacts on the world, Antoniades says. But it also reiterated the importance of careful research. \u201cThere\u2019s a rigor it adds to the research \u2014 the interpretation, the representation,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a subject like mental health, you have to tread water and be very, very careful about assumptions you have. And the only way to kind of get round the tropes or assumptions that exist in your head is to start with research and lived experience.\u201d In other words, he says, facts over fun. \u201cI think we\u2019ll make better games for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not that much room to explore. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nThe project is still largely exploratory; Ninja Theory doesn\u2019t have a finished project to show just yet. Antoniades considers the studio to be at the beginning of a journey that will likely take years. Right now, it\u2019s more of a pilot for a bigger movement. \u201cIf we can prove that we can make inroads into this area by collaborating and conducting the development in a certain way that\u2019s ethical, and open, and scientifically backed,\u201d Antoniades says. \u201cThat could become a model for other people to do the same and tackle other areas. There isn\u2019t any single problem to solve here. It\u2019s like solving climate changes. It requires everyone working together on many different levels.\u201d\n\nNinja Theory will still pursue work on its more traditional games, and it has several other projects the team is working on. Still, Antoniades says, there\u2019s an approach here that could work \u2014 one that combines scientific results with technology to improve or introduce therapeutic techniques. Now, at least, Ninja Theory has the ability to test those ideas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite a few independent games that are doing [work with mental health], but the model is built around releasing products that are known, that are safe and known,\u201d Antoniades says of the industry at large. \u201cIt\u2019s a big budget commercial problem in consoles and PCs. You get funding from a publisher who wants you to make a game according to a certain sense of requirements. There\u2019s not that much room to explore. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d", "description": "Developer Ninja Theory is working on a new venture called The Insight Project that aims to carefully represent mental health.
