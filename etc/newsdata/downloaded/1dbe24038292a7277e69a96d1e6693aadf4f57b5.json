Ball added that Limbaugh may have been referring to \u201cparty photos\u201d from 2010 that have surfaced online, but noted that she was an adult and not undressed in those photos.\n\nView photos Krystal Ball is setting the record straight after Rush Limbaugh accused her of posing for explicit photos as a teen.

(Photo: REUTERS/Micah Walter) More\n\nBut Ball said that that the larger issue was that Limbaugh would try to shame her \u2014 and by extent, other young women \u2014 for taking a provocative photo.\n\n\u201cNot everyone has the platform that I have to be able to call him out and set the record straight, and I don\u2019t want to feel like he can just slime whoever he wants and get away with it, with no accountability,\u201d she said. \u201cBut ... if I did have some naked photos from when I was 14 or 15 or whenever, who freaking cares? It is not your job to be the moral police or to shame me or any other young woman who is out there who may have nude photos that come out. If they want to run for office, if they want to be political leaders, they still can.\u201d\n\nBall, a former candidate for Congress, also tweeted about Limbaugh\u2019s \u201cslut-shaming.\u201d\n\nMaybe just ignore it and move on. But the reality is, his show has millions of listeners and the transcript is readily available online. I didn't want this slut-shaming smear just hanging out there. I'm also lucky enough to have a platform to set the record straight. \u2014 Krystal Ball (@krystalball) September 12, 2019\n\nLimbaugh doesn't get to be the morality police and I won't stand by when slut-shaming is being used to undermine yet another woman, even when that woman is me. Here are his full comments and my full response. Also for the record @esaagar is the greatest. https://t.co/uV3jU9MjDu \u2014 Krystal Ball (@krystalball) September 12, 2019\n\nBall is being praised for speaking out against the radio host, with many suggesting she file a lawsuit against him.\n\nYou keep standing Krystal and Rush is one of the last people who should be trying shame anyone. Moreover, you don\u2019t answer to him. Who the hell is he? He can\u2019t stop your shine! Keep doing you KB! \u2014 Nina Turner (@ninaturner) September 12, 2019\n\nA well crafted and elegant response to an extraordinarily crude attempt to smear you. I, and all decent people, stand with you Krystal. \u2014 Deep into History (@DeepintoHistory) September 12, 2019\n\nSue that man immediately! \u2014 Brett Gartin (@Berninheart) September 12, 2019\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
