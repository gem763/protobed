This week, the rapper somewhat backtracked on her comments and admitted she had no idea fans would be so disappointed if she quit music.\n\nSadly, the fact that one of the most successful female rappers didn\u2019t realise her worth was shocking.\n\nAlthough Nicki\u2019s relationship with Kenneth was initially shrouded in controversy due to his colourful past, getting married is undoubtedly the happiest time of her life.\n\nSo why should she feel as though she has to choose between being happy and her career?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2019, you should be able to have it all without question.\n\nShe\u2019s a wife (Picture: Nicki Minaj / Instagram)\n\nWomen all around the world with regular office jobs are faced with this predicament all the time, but you wouldn\u2019t expect it of a global superstar with the means to come and go as she pleases.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve decided to retire & have a family. I know you guys are happy now.\n\n\u2018To my fans, keep reppin me, do it til da death of me, X in the box \u2013 cuz ain\u2019t nobody checkin me. Love you for LIFE [sic], Nicki told her fans in September.\n\nShe now says: \u2018It was really about the fifth album. Where do I stand with it now?\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know my fans would act like that with the tweet. It hurt my feelings because I feel like the way I did it was maybe insensitive to my fans. But I didn\u2019t think people were going to take it \u2013 I didn\u2019t know it was going to be that big of a deal.\u2019\n\nIt was especially a big deal because female rappers have recently shown that a woman really can have it all.\n\nCardi B was told she would ruin her career by having a baby (Picture: AP/Instagram/iamcardib)\n\nIf Nicki ever needed a case example of an artist at the top of her game who so-called \u2018risked\u2019 it all to have a family, she need look no further than Cardi B.\n\nGranted, they\u2019re rivals with no love lost between them but Cardi is the proof that a female artists can juggle family with being a superstar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2017, Cardi secretly married Migos rapper Offset and didn\u2019t announce it until several months later \u2013 all the while continuing to slay the charts and streaming figures.\n\nAfter announcing her pregnancy in early 2018, the Bodak Yellow rapper gave birth to her and Offset\u2019s daughter Kulture in July that year.\n\nWhen she revealed her baby news, Cardi openly spoke of how those in her circle warned she\u2019d ruined her career before it even started. At this point, Cardi hadn\u2019t even released her debut studio album but, as well all know, she went on to win the best rap album at the Grammys with Invasion of Privacy.\n\nAnd she pretty much had a newborn at home.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t double standards in music.\n\nNicki\u2019s feeling that she had to choose between her personal and professional life stems from the stigma that rap is strictly a man\u2019s playing field with exclusivity for only a handful of women.\n\nSometimes, the double standards are overwhelmingly obvious.\n\nT.I. recently caused a stir with his list of the best rappers of all time when he said he couldn\u2019t include both Lil Kim and Nicki because of their similarities in impact and style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Nicki would not be here doing the things that she is doing if Lil Kim wouldn\u2019t did that,\u2019 T.I. explained.\n\nBut that could be said for so many of the other male rappers on that list.\n\nIn that same train of thought \u2013 would Jay Z really have done what he did if it weren\u2019t for his pal Biggie paving the way of him and so many others? They both made it into his top five, so why wasn\u2019t it that easy for Nicki and Lil Kim?\n\nMeg has been studying for a degree this whole time (Picture: MTV)\n\nBut it\u2019s not all bad. There are other success stories for women in rap achieving accomplishments outside of having children.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion had the ultimate #HotGirlSummer but was studying for her college degree the whole time.\n\nThe 24-year-old is in her third year at Texas Southern University and we all know how stressful those dissertations can be.\n\nSo imagine writing essays and studying for exams while travelling around the US, performing shows and releasing music like Megan has done?\n\nThe music industry is like swings and roundabouts \u2013 one week you\u2019re up, the next you\u2019re not as popular but it\u2019s fickle enough that there\u2019s always the chance to make a comeback if timed perfectly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B and Megan are inspiration that it is possible to have it all.\n\nBut Nicki is in her own lane.\n\nHopefully getting married won\u2019t be the last we hear of her talents.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
