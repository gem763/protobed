Each of the two panels in the diptych had four scenes.\n\nThe \u201cChrist Mocked\u201d painting\u2019s French owner in Compiegne, northeast of Paris, thought it was just an old religious icon when she sought an appraisal from auctioneers at Acteon, the house organising the sale in nearby Senlis.\n\n\u201cThe style, the ornamentation of the gold background, the matchings of the backs of the panels and the overall conditions of the three confirms that they were part of the left side of the same diptych,\u201d Acteon said.\n\nOnly two other elements of the diptych are known to exist: \u201cThe Flagellation of Christ\u201d displayed at the Frick in New York, and \u201cThe Virgin and Child with Two Angels\u201d at the National Gallery in London.\n\nThe \u201cVirgin\u201d was valued at 6.5 million pounds ($8.3 million) when it was given to the museum in 2000 in lieu of inheritance taxes by a British aristocrat who found it while cleaning out his ancestral seat in Suffolk.\n\nCimabue is renowned for his mosaics, frescoes and altarpieces.\n\nHistorians say only about a dozen works on wood \u2014 all unsigned \u2014 are thought to have been made by the Italian artist.\n\nHis more natural and nuanced depictions marked a turning point for Italian painters still influenced by highly stylised Byzantine art.\n\nArt historians consider him a trailblazer for the creative Renaissance that would flourish under greats like Giotto, one of Cimabue\u2019s pupils.\n\n\u201cChrist Mocked\u201d has been on public display at the city hall in Senlis since Friday.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 An art auction opens on Sunday for an early Renaissance painting by the Italian master Cimabue, just weeks after the rare work was", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/0ef68c_rare-work-by-13th-century-italian-master-cimabue-was-in-french-woman-kitchen-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
