I left a lot of my approach shots below the hole and I was able to be pretty aggressive.\"\n\nEven though players were allowed preferred lies, the course dried remarkably well after being deluged with six inches (150 mm) of rain on Friday. It was the fear of spectators slipping and sliding in mud that prompted the unusual fan ban.\n\nThe third round and the first part of the final round are scheduled for Sunday, with the remainder of the final round set for Monday morning.\n\nSpectators will be allowed back in on Sunday and most of the sellout crowd of nearly 20,000 will no doubt have eyes for Woods, playing in Japan for the first time since 2006.\n\nWoods, 43, is also playing his first event since undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee two months ago.\n\nThough the course was closed, several hundred people still gathered around the first tee to watch him, and a couple of hundred walked every hole, mostly TV camera crews, still photographers, golf writers and tournament officials.\n\nThe 15-times major champion started well with a six-foot birdie at the first hole and apart from a pulled iron shot that led to a bogey at the second did not miss a beat.\n\nWoods certainly noticed the unusual atmosphere, just the second time in his pro career he has played sans spectators he said.\n\n\"I made a couple putts today and I went to put my hand up and I'm like, don't put your hand up, there's no one clapping, so just move on about your business and just go ahead and keep trying to plug my way up the board, and I was able to do that,\" he said.
