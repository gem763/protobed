He also launched the Teachers\u2019 Innovation Platform (TIP), which invested in SpaceX in June.\n\nTeachers\u2019 is going all in on tech: the fund is overhauling its operations and those of its portfolio companies as it gears itself up for an economic downturn and a global trade war.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t the only pension fund with a new tech focus. The Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) have new billion-dollar tech funds and plans to overhaul their investing strategies. CPPIB and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) announced new tech-focused divisions coupled with San Francisco offices this year.\n\nYet Hindo, who has been in the CIO job for a little over a year, has a plan to beat the competition.\n\nIn an interview shortly after The Logicreported that the fund was planning a new incubator, Koru, he discussed why he wants to expand in India, why OTPP is focusing on private equity and infrastructure investments and his plan for diversifying Teachers\u2019 $200-billion portfolio.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow does Koru fit into Teachers\u2019 overall strategy of increasing exposure in the tech space?\n\nIn private equity, infrastructure and natural resources, we have more than 90 private holdings across three diverse sets of sectors and geographies. The idea behind Koru is to help them do venture and to help them think about new businesses and new possibilities that heavily leverage technology to drive exceptional growth in revenue.\n\nIt will tackle early-stage venture in traditional economic sectors, which, frankly, will sooner or later be disrupted one way or the other through external forces. We\u2019re trying to inculcate that entrepreneurial mindset, so we get to disrupt our own businesses before external forces disrupt us.\n\nCPPIB and the Caisse recently launched internal reviews to look at the potential for disruption among their own companies. Teachers\u2019 is partnering with an outside group to do the same. What\u2019s the benefit of having BCG involved?\n\nBCG Digital Ventures has entrepreneurs, software engineers, startup guys, a lot of data analysts. BCG Digital Ventures, we\u2019ve gotten to know very well over the last couple of years. They\u2019ve already stood up 90 startups or ventures by working with companies, and are doing it very successfully.\n\nWe always say one of our core values is partnering, and I believe we picked the right horse here. They\u2019re a perfect partner for us, to help us inculcate that venture, that startup mentality, that entrepreneurial spirit inside our portfolio companies. I can\u2019t really comment on what the other pension plans are doing.\n\nKoru is early-stage venture, focusing on our holdings or private investments. TIP is late-stage venture and growth equity, but for new external investments.\n\nWhen we put both of them together, they really cover the entire venture-risk spectrum. We have early-stage venture, but focusing on our own businesses \u2014 that\u2019s where our edge is.\n\nWe really don\u2019t have that much of an edge going in Silicon Valley, targeting Series A early-stage venture types. A, they\u2019re not scalable. B, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve got the network to actually find out who are the entrepreneurs in their basement that are about to launch Series A. That\u2019s not where we believe we can compete.\n\nBoth OMERS and CPPIB have opened San Francisco offices in the past year. Is Teachers\u2019 interested?\n\nWe haven\u2019t really landed on whether we need an office or not. I\u2019m not sure the winning formula is only going to be in Silicon Valley. We see thriving technologies coming out of Asia and Europe, too, which is probably a market that is not as competed-out as you have in the States.\n\nIn September, Ontario Teachers\u2019 said it would switch its focus from investing via limited partners in India to making direct investments in both infrastructure and private equity. Private equity and infrastructure seem to be focuses for a lot of your new initiatives: Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, Koru, the Teachers\u2019 Innovation Platform. Why?\n\nThey\u2019ve always been areas of focus for us. We were one of the early adopters of going direct and internal in private assets: first in private equity, then we started infrastructure almost 17, 18 years ago.\n\nI think the emphasis on India is that it is a vibrant emerging market with huge potential. We are going to invest significantly in our employees in Asia. I will be going with a senior investment team to India later this fall. We\u2019re going to spend the whole week meeting with businesspeople, fund investors, our partners on the GP (general partner) side there and government officials.\n\nAre there other parts of the world you\u2019re planning trips to?\n\nWe have pretty excellent capabilities in Europe, based out of the London office, with, again, a great emphasis on both private equity and infrastructure, as well as high-conviction equities. We\u2019re going to grow our capabilities in Europe, as well.\n\nWhen we look 10 years out, we want to make sure we\u2019re as global as we could be, so that we can scour the earth for the best opportunities from a risk-adjusted-return perspective and deploy capital accordingly. Canada is unfortunately too small a market for us.\n\nIn August, Teachers\u2019 announced it had crossed $200 billion in net assets, and you said, \u201cOver the last few years, we have been transitioning the asset mix to a more balanced approach from a risk perspective and \u2026 we increased our allocation to the fixed-income asset class.\u201d Is that in response to the trade war and global volatility?\n\nWhen we looked at the portfolio a few years ago, we realized that it doesn\u2019t have enough fixed-income exposure. Why do we need fixed-income exposure? Two reasons.\n\nFirst: income, because you clip coupons on government bonds. Second: from a diversification perspective, because fixed income typically does well in recessions or economic downturns.\n\nWe are in the 10th or 11th year of the economic expansion. It is getting a little long in the tooth in that cycle. You need fixed income. You need it because of a recession. You need it because of the trade war and tensions. By themselves, they\u2019re having pressure on the manufacturing sector of the economy.\n\nBig picture, what does success in tech look like for you five years from now?\n\nFirst, we want to generate returns. And we want to make sure that from a capability perspective, we participate in the new trends that define the new economy.\n\nThey both serve that purpose, Koru and TIP. But for Koru specifically, we want to have about 15 to 20 portfolio ventures established that are hopefully commercially profitable.\n\nOn TIP, really, it\u2019s about making sure that we understand technological disruption. That we\u2019re participating in those new sectors \u2014 be it health or telecommunications or cleantech \u2014 that really define tomorrow\u2019s economy.\n\nIt\u2019s also about inculcating that digital, technological mindset, internally but also within portfolio companies.\n\nFinally, tech is extremely important when it comes to attracting and retaining talent. Young talent want to come work for organizations that are vibrant, dynamic, thinking about technology, thinking about the future \u2014 whether it\u2019s cleantech or sustainable investing.\n\nThe Logic", "description": "Teachers\u2019 is going all in on tech with a plan to beat the competition", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/teachers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
