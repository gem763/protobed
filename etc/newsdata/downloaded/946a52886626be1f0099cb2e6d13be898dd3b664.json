Predictably, the outgoing guard acknowledged the recognition by shimmying her way out of the huddle to fans\u2019 delight.\n\nBy the end of the afternoon, there was no reason for Cloud and her teammates not to dance some more.\n\nThe Washington Mystics won a game in the WNBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, beating the Connecticut Sun 95-86 in Game 1 Sunday at the Entertainment and Sports Arena.\n\nA 9-0 Mystics run in the middle of the fourth quarter, powered by league MVP Elena Delle Donne and fellow All-Star Kristi Toliver, helped them get away. Toliver fed Delle Donne off a crossover dribble for a jumper, and later got a finger-roll layup of her own to fall. The run was enough to keep Connecticut at bay for the final few minutes.\n\nGame 2 will be played Tuesday at 8 p.m. The Mystics are now two wins away from their first WNBA title.\n\nDelle Donne led the Mystics with 22 points and 10 rebounds, Ariel Atkins recorded 21 points and Toliver added 17. Cloud put up 13 points and seven assists and shot 3-for-6 from the 3-point arc.\n\nThe Mystics finished the first quarter on an 12-0 run to break open a 13-point lead. The Sun fumbled away four straight possessions with a 3-second violation, a wayward pass that got caught in Natasha Cloud\u2019s ankles, a traveling call and still another turnover.\n\nConnecticut kept pace with Washington as Alyssa Thomas scored 13 points in the second quarter for the Sun. The Mystics\u2019 lead was down to 55-46 at halftime.\n\nA third quarter played largely at the free throw line only grew Washington\u2019s lead to 10. With the game still close, the Sun hit some open 3-pointers to get within four points early in the fourth before the Mystics pulled away.\n\nConnecticut guard Courtney Williams went 6 of 9 from the arc to lead all scorers with 26 points, and Alyssa Thomas finished with 20.\n\nAfter Tuesday, the series shifts to Connecticut for Game 3 next Sunday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
