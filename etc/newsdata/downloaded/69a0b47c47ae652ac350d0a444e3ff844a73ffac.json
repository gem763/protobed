He stares smugly into the camera under the caption \u201cLadies Man.\u201d\n\nThis young man would go on to become president of the United States.\n\n\u201cThe young lady in the picture, however, was not graduating senior Donald Trump\u2019s girlfriend. Nor was she a visiting friend,\u201d write journalists Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy in their new book, \u201cAll The President\u2019s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe woman in the picture is 19-year-old Fran D\u2019Agati Dunn, a secretary who worked at the school at the time and was asked to step in for the photo. Nothing more than a prop.\u201d\n\nGetty / Hachette Books \"All The President's Women,\" a new book from Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy, details a stunning breadth of allegations Donald Trump faces of misconduct and poor treatment of women.\n\nIt is this sort of narration, combined with a stunning 43 new allegations of Trump\u2019s sexual misconduct, that makes \u201cAll The President\u2019s Women\u201d such an impactful read. Levine and El-Faizy painstakingly document Trump\u2019s decadeslong history of treating women as objects and accessories, from making derogatory comments to walking into the dressing rooms of underage beauty queens to alleged rape.\n\nWe wanted to look at not just what he had done, but why and what it meant. Barry Levine\n\nIn early 2018, when adult film star Stormy Daniels was dominating the news cycle, Levine took notice. Between Daniels\u2019 claim that Trump had paid her hush money and the accounts of 20 other women who came forward against Trump during the 2016 election, Levine knew there had to be more there.\n\nOnce he started digging, he realized he wanted to collaborate with another seasoned journalist, specifically a woman, on the project. After a couple of initial conversations, he decided he wanted to work with El-Faizy to tell a story that went beyond individual allegations of inappropriate behavior.\n\n\u201cI think we wanted to look at not just what he had done, but why and what it meant,\u201d said El-Faizy. \u201cHow he came to be formed as the predator he became.\u201d\n\nHuffPost spoke with Levine and El-Faizy about the more than 100 interviews they conducted over the year they were writing the book, the patterns that emerged, and what the predatory behavior of the \u201cmost visible man on earth\u201d says about our culture at large.\n\nHECTOR RETAMAL via Getty Images Adult film actress Stormy Daniels speaks to the media outside U.S. Federal Court on April 16, 2018, in New York City.\n\nYou reported 43 new allegations of misconduct against the president in this book. How did you all just go about locating the women that you spoke to? And also what made these women want to share their stories publicly?\n\nLevine: It was extremely difficult. It was a very intensive period to cover, and that\u2019s why I focused on the reporting while Monique was able to shape the narrative. But in terms of the women, I was fortunate \u2015 in addition to finding Monique \u2015 there were two other journalists that I was able to put together on my small team. One was Whitney Clegg, an investigative producer who re-interviewed some of the victims who came forward in 2016. And then I also was able to collaborate with Lucy Osborne, a producer for the BBC in London, who had done a documentary on Donald Trump and women. She had some leads on some women, particularly young models, that she had wanted to chase down. So she went off in one direction, Whitney went off in another direction, Monique was taking all the interviews as we were filing them and, under a tremendous deadline, turned the book into what I would consider a great read.\n\nBut I\u2019ll just tell you one story, about Karen Johnson. She\u2019s the woman who made the allegations about the night at Mar-a-Lago during a New Year\u2019s Eve party, [during the time] when Melania Trump was dating Donald Trump. [Johnson says that] when Melania was upstairs, she was attacked [by Trump]. She said he had actually done to her [what he described doing in] the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes, in terms of grabbing her. She was someone who held onto this story for many, many years, and was fearful originally to come out with this story because she had been a dancer in her earlier life. And she thought, if I come out and say this, they\u2019re going to attack me, they\u2019re going to call me a liar because I had once been a dancer. And so she kept this secret.\n\nIt took me two full months before she even felt comfortable to begin telling me the details. So, it\u2019s been a very emotional journey in terms of getting these brave and courageous women to come forward. And I just have to say, I\u2019m just so thankful that I was able to work with Monique and Lucy and Whitney to pull all this together.\n\nWhat patterns emerged for you as you were going through all of the reporting?\n\nEl-Faizy: To me, that was the unexpected power of the book. We\u2019ve all heard the stories, the women would come forward one by one. But when you put it all in one space, first of all, it\u2019s enormous, and that\u2019s shocking in and of itself, but these patterns really do emerge. [Trump] clearly has a thing for younger women. He started talking about Ivanka being sexy when she was around the same age as these models that he was kind of staring at backstage and pursuing at parties. So that\u2019s one of the patterns.\n\nHe likes porn stars, as we\u2019ve seen throughout his life. And he has these habits. He\u2019ll push somebody against the wall and try and kiss them. He\u2019ll grab a breast or a buttock. When he\u2019s in a property that he owns, whether it be a hotel or Mar-a-Lago, he feels that he has the right to walk in on a woman in her room.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that there were very few one-offs. We only put things in [the book] that fit the pattern, because he has such well-established patterns over the years. What was powerful about that is, when we would interview the women, almost all of them in some way blamed themselves: \u201cWhat kind of vibe was I putting off? What was I wearing?\u201d And when you look at them in the context of these patterns, you realize it has almost nothing to do with that woman. If it wasn\u2019t that woman, it would\u2019ve been another woman wearing something else and putting off a totally different vibe.\n\nHe\u2019ll push somebody against the wall and try and kiss them. He\u2019ll grab a breast or a buttock. When he\u2019s in a property that he owns, whether it be a hotel or Mar-a-Lago, he feels that he has the right to walk in on a woman in her room. Monique El-Faizy\n\nI think that really comes across in the book, especially when you get to the end and you\u2019re reading the appendix, which outlines every single allegation. There are stories that you\u2019ll get to one and say, oh, that sounds exactly like that other woman\u2019s story, down to the details. It\u2019s very striking.\n\nLevine: About six months into the reporting, we were getting all these new stories, in addition to cataloging the earlier allegations that were made in 2016. And at the same time, I was also digging into research and finding stories about [Trump\u2019s] inappropriate behavior with women that had popped up in the media but had never really been cataloged \u2015 everything from making horrible comments to a model that was seated at a table with Graydon Carter, to incidents where he himself said that he attacked women, [like] pouring a glass of wine on a reporter in New York.\n\nTo me, [these incidents] all needed to be cataloged. I think it\u2019s very powerful, after you go through the beautifully shaped narrative that Monique wrote, that you then get, in very black and white fashion, every single allegation of inappropriate behavior, in addition to the disparaging comments that I found he made involving so many women. I just think when you read them one after another, it is extremely impactful. And so the appendix of this book, to me, is as important as the narrative itself.\n\nAs you both alluded to earlier, you take a deep look into Trump\u2019s early years, which is probably something that most readers will know less about. To me, it seemed like his treatment of women as objects and accessories began very early. Would you say that that\u2019s accurate?\n\nEl-Faizy: Absolutely. That\u2019s why I chartered the book the way I did. In his graduation photo from the military academy, the woman standing next to him is an accessory. To me, that said it all.\n\nAnd I think that that comes from his father, too. His father would bring these young, pretty girls up to the academy. From what his classmates say, these were not women that Donald Trump knew or had any kind of relationship with. They were just girls that his dad would bring up for him, presumably for the image of it. So I think that he didn\u2019t develop that attitude in a vacuum.\n\nAnd how do you think those early experiences with women then impacted his relationship with women later on in his life?\n\nEl-Faizy: What\u2019s interesting is that he never changes. We interviewed one of his classmates, Andy McIntosh, who said, \u201cWe were in an all-male academy. We learned about women and girls from Playboy magazine. But then we got out and realized, oh no, that\u2019s not an appropriate way to look at women.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump just never made that change. To me, what\u2019s interesting is that nothing later in his life impacted him enough to force him to reconsider his attitude.\n\nThe book also gets into Trump\u2019s obsession with models, with Playboy, and with beauty pageants. You include a quote from a former Miss Arizona who says that she believes Trump purchased the Miss Universe organization explicitly \u201cto utilize his power to get around beautiful women.\u201d What did you take away from that?\n\nEl-Faizy: Trump is, at his heart, a business guy. And if that\u2019s your mind state, you buy whatever you want in life. He had the money to do it; he wanted these women, so he just went out and bought access to women, with the beauty pageant, with the modeling agency. And I think for a lot of these men, it\u2019s as much about being around the women as it is how it looks to other men.\n\nThere\u2019s a story in the book from a hairstylist who used to blow-dry Marla Maples\u2019 hair. And he told me that Trump would come into the salon and just stand by her chair and look around and see who was watching him be with Marla. So it wasn\u2019t that much about, \u201cOh, I want to see my girlfriend Marla.\u201d It was about, \u201cI want to be seen in the presence of this young, beautiful blonde.\u201d It\u2019s the equivalent of driving a red Ferrari.\n\nLevine: I tend to take a much darker view of those years. It\u2019s absolutely clear in the book that for Donald Trump, creating his own modeling agency and being a part of some of these other beauty pageants and contests that he would arrange parties for at the Plaza Hotel in the \u201990s \u2014 that became his personal hunting ground.\n\nTake the story, for instance, that Heather Braden told. Heather was a model, and she told a story where Trump and these actors were in this giant Miami Beach mansion with like 50 models. It really wasn\u2019t a party. The whole thing was an exercise for Donald Trump and these three other men to see how many of these models they could take in the private rooms, sometimes two or three women at a time.\n\nHeather was older at the time, and she was kind of watching everything take place. She turned down Trump, but she said these younger models didn\u2019t know any better. And they would come out disheveled; they would look very uncomfortable when they came out of the private rooms, and there was no question in her mind that these were sexual experiences taking place. Donald Trump had created this private hunting ground to allow himself access to young models. And he formed a very tight relationship with John Casablancas, the founder of the Elite modeling agency.\n\nFor Donald Trump, creating his own modeling agency and being a part of some of these other beauty pageants and contests ... that became his personal hunting ground. Levine\n\nThis book puts all of these allegations together and uncovers a lot of new information, but for years now, there has been a pretty well-documented history of Trump\u2019s misogyny and sexual misconduct. And yet it largely has not been seen as a dealbreaker for his supporters. Why do you think that there are a lot of people who feel allegations of sexual misconduct can be dismissed or overlooked?\n\nEl-Faizy: Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. I had written a book about evangelical Christianity years ago, so I went back to that community for this book because, of course, the evangelical community is probably what put Trump over the edge in 2016. That community is very much run by male leaders, and so it was the men who really drove that train for Trump.\n\nOne of the evangelical women I spoke to and I said, \u201cWhat is it? Why are they supporting him?\u201d She said, \u201cI think that a lot of them think, \u2018If I wasn\u2019t a Christian, that\u2019s what I would be doing.\u2019\u201d Trump is surrounded by porn stars and beautiful blondes and whatever. And so she thought there was a certain kind of male envy.\n\nThe structure of the evangelical church, where Trump gets the bulk of his support, is very patriarchal. For them, this kind of patriarchy is what God has instructed them to do, and they find all kinds of different ways of rationalizing it. Early on, I called an old source of mine. I said, \u201chow on earth are you supporting him?\u201d And they said, \u201cGod uses imperfect vessels.\u201d So they rationalize it by saying, [Trump] is being used, he\u2019s a tool of God. He doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, we\u2019re all sinners. But at the very core of their support is just a comfort with patriarchy and the idea that women are supposed to be submissive to men.\n\nAnd then the more cynical answer is the community supports him because he does what they want him to do. He gets them conservative judges, he\u2019s helping roll back abortion laws, things like that. But in terms of the women being able to support him, it\u2019s because they live within a world in which they\u2019ve completely accepted the idea of patriarchy.\n\nI feel like another sentiment that I hear a lot, even among people who believe that Trump is predatory, is exhaustion and frustration that these allegations don\u2019t seem to stick to him. So, why bother? What would you say to those people?\n\nEl-Faizy: I think that\u2019s part of the reason why it was important to put all these [allegations] in one place, because it is easier to dismiss individual behaviors. But when you look at it all in the aggregate, you realize it\u2019s not really just about one man\u2019s behavior; it is about systems that allow this behavior to go on for decades and decades. Trump is one of many men who has been able to be predatory with women. I would argue, right now, he\u2019s the one we should be looking at because he\u2019s the most visible man in the world and he sets an example. But there needs to be a look at the systems that allow this to go on.\n\nWhen we brush aside or when we say we\u2019re tired of this, we\u2019re being complicit, we\u2019re letting it go on. We have to get outraged about every one of these things. I\u2019m now sort of going off-topic a little bit, but when I read the Ta-Nehisi Coates book \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d that was the thing that I came away with. We can\u2019t just say, \u201cOh, there\u2019s another black kid getting shot.\u201d We have to be outraged every time or this never ever changes.\n\nIt\u2019s not really just about one man\u2019s behavior; it is about systems that allow this behavior to go on for decades and decades. El-Faizy\n\nLevine: This is a man who wants another four years to be president of our country. You can\u2019t say, \u2018Who cares?\u2019 You can\u2019t turn away from the truth.\n\nGiven the sheer breadth of allegations that exist against President Trump, do you think that we should be speaking about him in the same way that we speak about predatory men like Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein?\n\nEl-Faizy: I think absolutely.\n\nLevine: The reporting shows that Donald Trump has been a predator over the course of many decades. There needs to be a reckoning here of his behavior. And we had to attempt to connect the dots to show not only the actual instances of the allegations but also to talk about how he became a predator. And I hope that the readers will get answers to that.\n\nWhy is it so essential for the American public to grapple with Trump\u2019s predatory behavior? What does this one man\u2019s story say about our culture at large?\n\nEl-Faizy: I think it\u2019s his behavior, but also his policies. His behavior reveals an attitude about women, and that attitude is being held by the man who formed policy for American women and also for women around the globe. And we see the manner in which those attitudes are affecting women around the world, and the systems that are supporting these kinds of things.\n\nWhat was so hurtful about the confirmation [of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh] was that you had an accuser [Christine Blasey Ford] who came forward, she was credible, people listened to her. And yet there was very little investigation and he was confirmed anyway. So I think a lot of women felt like, we thought we made all these advances since the \u201960s, but in fact, the patriarchy is alive and well and still completely in control of the system. And I think that\u2019s important to examine.\n\nSo now the book is out there in the world and we have this information. What should we be doing with it? What do you hope comes next?\n\nLevine: I really think it is so important now, despite everything else going on with the impeachment inquiry, that investigative news organizations take the time to pick up these allegations and dig deeper because there are still so many stories. There is so much more material out there on Donald Trump and women.\n\nWhen I was wrapping up the book, the E. Jean Carroll allegations [that Trump had attempted to rape Carroll in the mid-\u201990s] surfaced. And first of all, after the reporting I had done, everything that she said rang true. But beyond that, there were news organizations who were wrestling with whether they were going to present her allegations to begin with. And to me, that is the absolutely wrong thing. We need to allow these women to tell their stories. To me, that\u2019s the most important thing.\n\nEl-Faizy: I think that we\u2019ve seen that women are not fully valued in society and we need massive change. And I think that the midterm elections with all these young, newly elected women, were the beginning of that. And I hope that that\u2019s not just a one-off and that that continues, because until we reach parity in the power structures of organizations and in government, this is not going to be fully addressed and fully changed. We need to see more women getting elected and that this is not just a moment, but actually the beginning of some real change.\n\nLevine: I hope that even if people hear these allegations and don\u2019t even read the book, that it will make them aware that the story of Donald Trump and women, his predatory behavior, has not been fully written, and that this is something they should remember when they consider whether or not they want him to be president for another four years.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "In \"All The President's Women,\" journalists Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy uncover 43 new sexual assault allegations against the world's most powerful...", "authors": ["Senior Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db067a82100009428ad3af2.jpeg?cache=c1svndelar&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
