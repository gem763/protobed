Rick Chiarelli asked her if she would be open to wearing costumes to events such as Comic Con, an annual comic book convention.\n\nI just couldn't believe this was happening. I just kept thinking, it's 2019, how is this possible? - Complainant\n\nThe woman alleged Chiarelli then showed her a photo on his cellphone of a former employee dressed up in a revealing costume that she had worn to the popular event.\n\nShe said the councillor for College ward then asked her, \"What would you not wear?\" When she asked what he meant by that, she said Chiarelli responded: \"Well, would you go braless?\"\n\nThe woman said she was stunned by the request and told Chiarelli she was not comfortable with the suggestion.\n\nCouncillor showed her photo\n\nThe woman said the councillor then showed her a different cellphone picture of a woman in a low-cut T-shirt with a Canada logo on it. The photo was taken from the side, \"and you could see [the woman's] torso and you could clearly see that she was not wearing a bra,\" the woman told CBC.\n\nCBC has agreed not to name the complainant because of her concern that she would have trouble finding employment in the future if she's identified publicly. She was also concerned she'd face a backlash, especially on social media.\n\nCBC has not revealed the woman's name to Chiarelli, but has provided the councillor with identifying details including the date, place and general time of the interview, as well as the details of her allegations.\n\nCBC has spoken with six other employees and former employees who worked in Chiarelli's office, five of whom say they've heard the councillor make inappropriate comments in the workplace. Two told CBC Chiarelli also mentioned not wearing a bra to them.\n\nThis woman, who CBC has agreed not to name, alleges Chiarelli asked her inappropriate questions during a job interview at a Starbucks in late June. (Jean Delisle/CBC)\n\nChiarelli declines comment\n\nAfter several days of trying to contact Chiarelli for comment on the allegations, CBC received a letter last Friday from his lawyer, Bruce Sevigny.\n\nThe letter did not address any specific claims, but instead referred to \"spurious allegations.\" Sevigny wrote that Chiarelli has \"consistently conducted himself in accordance with the highest moral and ethical standards, and in full compliance with the City of Ottawa's Code of Conduct and Violence and Harassment in the Workplace Policy, and with the Ontario Human Rights Code.\"\n\nThe letter also alluded to \"specific information\" that the councillor had recently received that suggests \"highly improper motivations and tactics in relation to the spurious allegations.\"\n\nCBC responded to Sevigny by email late Friday afternoon, further detailing the allegations against Chiarelli and asking for any information that may be pertinent to the story.\n\n2nd letter from lawyer\n\nLate Monday afternoon, Chiarelli's lawyer sent a second letter stating that he had advised Chiarelli to \"completely refrain from responding to the allegations.\"\n\nThrough his lawyer, Chiarelli objected to being accused of misbehaviour by an unidentified person.\n\nIf someone is going to make this type of allegation against a respected family man, community builder, and three-decade member of City Council, they should at least be prepared to provide full and fair disclosure, and to stand behind the allegation publicly. - Bruce Sevigny, lawyer for Coun. Rick Chiarelli\n\n\"If someone is going to make this type of allegation against a respected family man, community builder, and three-decade member of City Council, they should at least be prepared to provide full and fair disclosure, and to stand behind the allegation publicly,\" the letter states.\n\nChiarelli had not been informed of a formal complaint made against him to the integrity commissioner, according to the letter.\n\n\"It would be completely inappropriate for Councillor Chiarelli to attempt to respond to any allegations outside the mandated formal complaint process, which is most certainly subject to strict confidentiality requirements,\" the councillor's lawyer wrote.\n\nThe letter also states that prior to being contacted by CBC, Chiarelli had no knowledge of the specific allegations.\n\nThe letter doesn't elaborate on the \"improper motivations\" alluded to in the first letter.\n\nCoun. Rick Chiarelli, left, responded to the allegations through his lawyer, who wrote that the councillor 'has always conducted himself according to the highest moral and ethical standards.' (CBC News)\n\nCouncillor 'a nice person'\n\nCBC spoke separately with five women who have worked in Chiarelli's office at some point in the last 18 months, and a sixth woman who worked for Chiarelli earlier and has returned to work for the councillor in recent weeks.\n\nThey all report having different experiences.\n\nThe woman who currently works for Chiarelli told CBC the councillor is \"a nice person,\" and said she never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour. In fact, the complainant reached out to the woman to ask if she had ever experienced anything that had made her uncomfortable while working in Chiarelli's office. The woman said she had not, and said she told the complainant that working in the councillor's office \"is a great experience.\"\n\nAnother woman contacted by CBC said she chose to wear costumes to family-friendly events in the ward. For example, she said, she dressed as a Harry Potter character on one occasion and a Disney character on another.\n\n'Inappropriate comments'\n\nFive women said they heard Chiarelli make inappropriate comments in the office, including a joke he repeatedly told about needing to sanitize one of the office desks because a former employee had had sex on it with another councillor.\n\nTwo of them said the councillor also mentioned going braless to them. One of the women said that during her interview last year, the councillor described revealing outfits other employees had worn and asked her what she thought about wearing shirts that showed the side of a woman's breasts. The woman said she told the councillor she wouldn't need to be told what to wear. She got the job.\n\nChiarelli brought up the topic with another employee in a text message exchange earlier this year after the woman asked his advice about the sort of dress she should wear to an awards ceremony.\n\nNothing \"ho-ish,\" the councillor texted back, \"but depending on the dress no bra required.\"\n\nThe letter from Chiarelli's lawyer did not address these allegations.\n\n'No bra required': Chiarelli's wardrobe advice to an employee. CBC has blacked out the councillor's cellphone number but has verified the message came from his number. (Provided)\n\nComplainant in 'state of denial'\n\nThe complainant said she began to look for work in the spring because her 90-day contract with the federal government was ending in early summer.\n\nA friend who had once worked for a former Ottawa city councillor forwarded her resum\u00e9 to someone who currently works on councillors' row at City Hall. From there, the woman's resum\u00e9 found its way to a central pool of CVs councillors can draw from when they're looking for new employees.\n\nThe complainant said she never applied directly to work in Chiarelli's office and doesn't know anyone who has worked for him. She received an email from Chiarelli in June asking if she was still looking for a job, and they arranged to meet at a Starbucks in Bells Corners in the early afternoon on June 23.\n\nThe complainant said the interview, which took more than two hours, began normally enough, with Chiarelli describing the job as including communications, website and social media updates, as well as attending evening events once or twice a week.\n\nStrange turn\n\nThe interview then took an unusual turn, according to the woman.\n\nThe 55-year-old councillor, who has been in politics since he was a teenager, kept emphasizing that his staff go to \"different types of events,\" she said. When she asked what he meant, the complainant said Chiarelli told her his employees liked to engage in \"a lot of cosplay,\" or adult dress-up.\n\nThat's when Chiarelli launched into a detailed discussion of what at least one former employee used to wear to some events and showed the complainant pictures on his phone, she said.\n\nIt was during this phase of their discussion that the woman said Chiarelli asked her if she was willing to go without a bra.\n\nShe alleged that at one point during the interview, Chiarelli looked up and down her bare arms and legs \u2014 she was wearing a summer dress \u2014 and asked what body parts she would not be willing to show.\n\n\"I was in a state of denial,\" the complainant told CBC. \"I just couldn't believe this was happening. I just kept thinking, it's 2019, how is this possible?\"\n\nChiarelli's constituency office at Ben Franklin Place in Ottawa. (Jean Desilse/CBC)\n\nBizarre recruitment scheme\n\nThe complainant said Chiarelli also described a bizarre-sounding strategy for signing up volunteers, which involved women in his office going to bars to flirt and drink with men. The female staffers were then supposed to pressure the men into volunteering at Chiarelli's office.\n\nThe woman said Chiarelli told her that when the men were later contacted by the women they'd met and asked to volunteer, they \"would not be able to say no because they will never admit that they were drunk and hitting on her.\"\n\nAnother one of the women contacted by CBC echoed that story, saying the councillor wanted her to recruit \"secret volunteers by going into bars, getting guys drunk, let them think I'd sleep with them, and then pressure them into volunteering.\"\n\nThe woman said she never did that.\n\nThe complainant said Chiarelli never explicitly told her that in order to get the job she would have to wear costumes, go braless or go to bars to flirt with men. But she said it was never clear to her whether she'd be pressured to do any of those things once she got the job.\n\nShe said Chiarelli called her on July 6 to offer her the job, and told her she could wear whatever she wanted. She declined the position.\n\nJob a stepping stone\n\nOttawa city councillors are each assigned an annual office budget of more than $250,000, much of which is used to pay their staff.\n\nWhile their salaries are paid with public money, and they're technically city employees, the staffers are hired on contracts that last, at most, until the end of each term of council. The positions are not unionized, so the workers can be hired and fired more easily than can regular city staff.\n\nBut a job in a councillor's office can also lead to other opportunities, and for that reason, they're often seen as desirable positions. It's not unusual for a councillor's assistant to transition to a full-time city staff job, with all the benefits and security that come with it.\n\nSome former councillors' assistants have successfully entered politics, and working in a councillor's office is seen as a great way to make connections in the community. In other words, it's a job that can open doors.\n\nChiarelli offered the woman a job in his office on July 6, but she declined the offer. (Laura Osman/ CBC)\n\n'I just want to do the right thing'\n\nThe complainant said she was livid after the interview and immediately called her mother, her roommate and, later, the friend who had forwarded her resum\u00e9. She also told her supervisor at the federal government.\n\nCBC has spoken independently with the roommate and the friend, both of whom corroborated the complainant's version of events.\n\nThe woman contacted CBC soon after the interview at the urging of her supervisor, with whom CBC also spoke. CBC first met with the complainant on June 28.\n\nShe said she was motivated to come forward with her story because she doesn't want other women to be asked the same sorts of questions she was asked.\n\n\"I just want to do the right thing,\" she told CBC.\n\nReached out to employee\n\nThe complainant said she also tried to reach out to former Chiarelli employees to find out about their experiences. The woman found someone on Reddit who said she had worked for the councillor for a short while but quit. That conversation was anonymous, and the complainant erased it.\n\nThrough her city hall contact, the woman was also put in touch with someone who worked for Chiarelli until 2018. That woman, who has returned to work for Chiarelli in the past few weeks, told CBC she told the complainant that she liked working for the councillor, never experienced anything amiss in his office and was never made to feel uncomfortable there.\n\nThe woman said she told the complainant that if Chiarelli had ever said or done anything to make her uncomfortable, she should \"tell him directly, and he will apologize, and he won't do it again.\"\n\nThe initial job interview took place at this Starbucks in Bells Corners in June. (Jean Deslisle/CBC)\n\nComplaint to integrity commissioner\n\nThe woman went in person to the mayor's reception area to complain directly to Mayor Jim Watson two days after the interview \u2014 the earliest she said she could get to City Hall because of her work schedule. There, she was told she should file a complaint with the integrity commissioner, who's responsible for making sure members of council adhere to the city's code of conduct.\n\nOn July 2, she emailed a complaint to the city's integrity commissioner, Robert Marleau. CBC has seen a copy of the email.\n\nLast Friday, she signed an affidavit swearing to the veracity of her version of events \u2014 a necessary step to formalize a complaint.\n\n10 days to respond\n\nMarleau said as a rule, he can neither confirm nor deny that a complaint has been filed, nor confirm whether an investigation is underway.\n\nAccording to the city's website, the integrity commissioner first screens submissions to ensure they're not frivolous. He then provides details of the complaint to the councillor in question, who has 10 days to respond.\n\nBased on the councillor's response, the integrity commissioner then decides whether to continue to move forward with a formal investigation, which can include hiring an outside investigator.\n\nHe generally keeps the identity of a complainant confidential during any investigation but provides enough information about a specific incident that a councillor can usually surmise the identity of the complainant.\n\nIf a councillor is found to have contravened the code of conduct, the integrity commissioner can recommend that he or she loses up to 90 days' pay or other measures.
