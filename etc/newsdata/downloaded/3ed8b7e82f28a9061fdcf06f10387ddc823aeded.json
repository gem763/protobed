Another photo showed a naked young woman lying on a beach.\n\nPOLICE VIDEO FROM JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S FLORIDA MANSION APPEARS TO SHOW PICTURES, SOME TOPLESS, OF GHISLAINE MAXWELL\n\nEntering the master bedroom, police discovered a drawing of a bare female backside and a painting of a naked woman, as well as what appeared to be a sketch of Maxwell. Several photos, sculptures and paintings seen in the video depicted the female backside.\n\nEccentric paintings and sculptures, one of which appeared to depict a blindfolded figure, also appeared in the video.\n\nThe mansion even included what appeared to be a dentist\u2019s chair and cart, stocked with drills and other instruments, as well as a lamp.\n\nThe FBI has raided Epstein\u2019s other properties, including his New York City mansion and his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nDuring a raid of Epstein\u2019s home on Manhattan's E. 71st St. conducted by the FBI and NYPD after his arrest, investigators said they found in a locked safe a trove of pornographic material apparently featuring young girls.\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN FLORIDA MANSION POLICE VIDEO SHOWS MASSAGE TABLES ALLEGEDLY USED FOR SEX ACTS WITH MINORS\n\nEpstein\u2019s bizarre art collection in his opulent Upper East Side home included a massive, life-like human doll hanging from a chandelier and a human-sized chessboard with scantily clad figurines modeled after his employees, New York Magazine reported. The Manhattan home also reportedly included a hallway adorned with dozens of individually framed prosthetic eyeballs from England and a massive, photorealistic mural of a prison yard painted, with Epstein in the center.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last month, Jennifer Araoz, who said Epstein raped her when she was just 15 years old, described his Manhattan home.\n\n\"He had a bathtub that was kind of like opened, and there was prosthetic breasts that he could play with while he was taking a bath, I guess,\" Araoz said in the interview, calling it \"odd.\"\n\nBIZARRE ART, PORN AND DOLLS: INSIDE JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S NEW YORK HOUSE OF HORRORS\n\nShe also said Epstein adorned his massage room with photos of naked women.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, Aroaz, sued Maxwell and three other unidentified female staff members for allegedly conspiring to allow her to be raped, according to the lawsuit obtained by Fox News.\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN HAD PAINTING OF GIRL LYING WITH BIG CAT AT NEW MEXICO HOME, IN LATEST ODD ART REVEAL\n\nEpstein\u2019s sprawling New Mexico home included a massive painting showing a young woman of indeterminate age wearing a wedding ring and cuddled up beside a roaring big cat, according to a photo of the artwork taken by a contractor who worked at the financier\u2019s Zorro Ranch in Stanley, N.M. in 2013. The photo was provided exclusively to Fox News last month.\n\n\u201cIt was huge \u2013 at least 5-by-5, 6-by-6 \u2013 in the main house, at the bottom of the stairs in the basement near the laundry,\u201d the contractor, who requested anonymity, told Fox News of the bizarre painting inside the 10,000-acre residence \u2013 which was dotted with pools, a firehouse, log cabins, guest homes and its own airport hangar and runway. \u201cWe would talk about how creepy it was, this strange painting with nothing else around it. From the minute you got there, you felt the uneasy vibe.\u201d\n\nBILL CLINTON PAINTING IN JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S HOME A 'SURPRISE' TO WOMAN WHO PAINTED PRESIDENT WEARING BLUE DRESS\n\nAnother eyebrow-raising item to emerge from the disgraced financier's art collection: the now-infamous \u201cParsing Bill\u201d oil painting featuring former President Bill Clinton, Epstein\u2019s onetime friend, posing seductively in the Oval Office while fitted in a blue Monica Lewinsky-style dress.\n\nThe video taken by police as they executed a search warrant at Epstein's Palm Beach home in 2005 gave the most comprehensive look at his art collection. Epstein was accused of molesting dozens of underage girls at the Florida mansion and by 2006, investigators had interviewed more than 30 young women \u2013 some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged molestations.\n\nIn the end, prosecutors and Epstein\u2019s lawyers negotiated a then-secret plea deal which led Epstein to serve just 13 months in jail under work-release privileges, allowing him to work in his office six days a week.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a child prostitution charge and registered as a sex offender.\n\nProsecutors confirmed last week that inquiries into Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators were ongoing and would continue despite the fact that the criminal case against Epstein was dismissed following his suicide in his jail cell earlier this month.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEpstein, who also owas accused of sex trafficking, was arrested on July 6 over allegations of sexual abuse of dozens of young girls in his Upper East Side townhouse and his Palm Beach mansion between 2002 and 2005.
