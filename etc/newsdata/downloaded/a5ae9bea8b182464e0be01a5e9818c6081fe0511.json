They also made demands in the past and we always try to accommodate their demands,\u201d BCB chief executive officer Nizamuddin Chowdhury told AFP.\n\nHe added that a board meeting would be held soon, without giving further details.", "description": "Dhaka (AFP) \u2013 Bangladesh\u2019s professional cricketers \u2014 including several members of the national squad \u2014 went on strike Monday to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/2467cd_bangladesh-national-cricket-team-captain-shakib-al-hasan-announcing-strike-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
