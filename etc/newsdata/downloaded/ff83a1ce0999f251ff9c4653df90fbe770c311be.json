And it killed him, Grossman said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese things, they just love to burn,\u201d he said. \u201cThe car is so overengineered. It\u2019s so techy, it makes you want to buy a Chevy pickup truck.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s public relations team did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit, filed this month, and the company\u2019s lawyers have yet to respond in court.\n\nAD\n\nShortly after the February crash, a Tesla spokeswoman told the Florida Sun-Sentinel that \u201cWe are deeply saddened by this accident\u201d but that \u201cTesla vehicles are engineered to be the safest cars in the world and Tesla drivers have driven more than 10 billion miles to date.\u201d\n\nAwan\u2019s death is one in a string of recent incidents that have been blamed on Tesla\u2019s innovative technology. A lawsuit stemming from a May 2018 crash that killed two teens also blamed a battery fire for at least one of the deaths. (Grossman represents the car\u2019s third passenger, who survived the accident after being thrown from the vehicle.)\n\nAD\n\nIn April, surveillance footage from a Shanghai parking garage showed smoke billowing from a Model S moments before the car burst into flames. The widely shared video prompted Tesla to open an internal investigation.\n\nAD\n\nSeveral other suits have attributed deaths to Tesla\u2019s \u201cAutopilot\u201d system, an automatic driver-assistance feature.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of these cases,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d\n\nIn Awan\u2019s case and others, the carmaker has argued that high-speed crashes can result in fires whether the car is powered by gasoline or batteries. But Awan survived the crash, and he could have escaped the smoke and fire, too, Grossman said \u2014 if only the police officer who arrived on the scene could have opened the car\u2019s doors.\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit asserts that the features rendered the car \u201cdefective\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d \u2014 the door handles compounding the problem of an \u201cinherently unstable\u201d battery.\n\n\u201cTesla failed to warn users about the scope and extent of the defective and unreasonably dangerous conditions of the Model S,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nAD\n\nThe Broward County autopsy report, obtained by The Washington Post, lists Awan\u2019s cause of death as \u201cinhalation of products of combustion with a contributory cause of death of thermal injuries.\u201d\n\nThe medical examiner who responded to the crash wrote that Awan \u201cwas not identifiable on scene.\u201d His clothes and hair were burned and a yellow metal ring was found on his left ring finger.\n\nAfter the crash, and after firefighters extinguished the blaze, Awan\u2019s Tesla was transported to a tow yard. Once there, it reignited and burned again.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The case is one in a string of recent incidents that have been blamed on Tesla\u2019s innovative technology.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bD7h0qmW0N7zIm7aSWuJe6uUTbA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EU5LAIBSTII6RFH2GLKIIYFZKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
