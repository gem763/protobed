But as long as officers suspect the wearer does so just to hide their identity, police can demand the removal of the mask, or else the person could be subject to arrest and a six-month jail term if convicted,\u201d said a government source.\n\nThe source added the law was meant to target people wearing masks who break the law. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to just remove masks from anyone,\u201d they said.\n\nThe other provision would see a law banning protesters wearing a mask at any public order event, or risk going to jail for a year.\n\nLam is expected to announce the implementation of the new law on Friday afternoon, alongside security minister John Lee Ka-chiu.", "description": "Chief Executive Carrie Lam is expected to announce the implementation of the new legislation this afternoon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/ad8a88c0-e63e-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires104014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
