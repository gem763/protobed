Photo: Andrew Matthews/PA Archive/PA Images\n\nWith 98% of Brits owning a debit card and even homeless charities trialling contactless payments, there is no denying that Britain is on its way to becoming a cashless society.\n\nBut what would happen if we were to become a cashless Britain? Analysis of the latest Access to Cash Report, conducted by banking services provider thinkmoney, has uncovered which regions are the most \u2013 and least \u2013 prepared to go cashless.\n\nAccording to the report, about 83% of the UK\u2019s population would cope if the UK were to become a cashless society. But some regions would fare worse that others.\n\nREAD MORE: 10 countries headed towards a cashless society\n\nUnsurprisingly, the research found London is most prepared for a cashless society. The UK\u2019s capital has recorded an 8.5% decrease in people using cash machines in the past year, with more people turning to their cards and digital payments.\n\nIn fact, southern regions appear to be better prepared than northern regions overall, with the south-east and the south-west noting similar drops, at 7.7% and 7% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, cash withdrawals in Northern Ireland only reduced by 2% between 2017 and 2018, suggesting people living there are likely to struggle in a cashless Britain. This could be because Northern Ireland contains many rural communities, which are likely to be the worst affected if the UK stops using cash.\n\nREAD MORE: Bank of America CEO \u2013 \u201cWe want a cashless society\u201d\n\nNotably, Northern Ireland is the only region in the UK that saw an increase in the number of bank branches between 2012 and 2018, with 8% more in the past six years. All other regions have noted a decrease in bank branch openings, with the largest drop of 21% in the south-west.\n\nWales, Scotland and the north-west \u2013 all down 3.3% \u2013 and the north-midlands \u2013 down 4.0% \u2013 would be similarly ill-prepared for a cashless society.\n\nOn top of this, the north-west has been hit hardest by bank closures in recent years. Just last year, it lost 75 \u2013 going from 1,260 to 1,185, the research found.\n\nREAD MORE: As cashless stores grow, so does the backlash\n\nThe Access to Cash report, published in March, warned that the poor, elderly and rural communities are at risk of being left behind if Britain continues to \u201csleepwalk\u201d into a cashless society.\n\nAlready, less than a third of UK transactions are made with cash, and the report\u2019s authors predict this figure will be just 10% by 2026.", "description": "Research has uncovered which regions are the most \u2013 and least \u2013 prepared to go cashless.", "authors": ["Abigail Fenton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9WBtVpk7cRw37U_xIn5rFg--~B/aD0xMzM1O3c9MjE2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/781d3a20-d9ff-11e9-bdfb-40a774ef743c", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
