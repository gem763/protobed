Protas, this year\u2019s third-round pick, rang up a goal and two assists, including the primary helper on Tom Wilson\u2019s game-winner in overtime to beat the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\n\u201cWhen I first stepped on the ice, I kinda felt the nerves, but after a couple shifts I felt good,\u201d McMichael said. \u201cI felt like it was just another game for me. I felt comfortable, so I had a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nJump to Thursday, and the two centers were returned to their junior league teams in Canada as the Capitals trimmed 18 players from their training camp roster.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t an indication that Washington\u2019s staff was unhappy with their play. There was little chance to begin with that either McMichael or Protas would make the opening-night 23-man roster.\n\nMcMichael perhaps had an outside shot, given Evgeny Kuznetsov\u2019s three-game suspension to start the year puts the Capitals down a center. He got a second look Wednesday, filling in when Lars Eller was scratched with an upper-body injury.\n\nBut the 18-year-old stands to gain from at least one more year with the Ontario Hockey League\u2019s London Knights, where he is coached by Capitals great Dale Hunter.\n\nProtas, from Belarus, won\u2019t fit into the Capitals\u2018 plans for a few seasons either. But for fans, the promise is something worth looking forward to.\n\n\u201cBetween Protas and McMichael, obviously, you can see the skill,\u201d coach Todd Reirden said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for our future and fun to watch them go through their first game together. Both made some really strong plays.\u201d\n\nReirden was less pleased with how Jonas Siegenthaler and Christian Djoos performed Monday night, but chalked it up to being the first game. The two young blueliners are competing for the third-line left defenseman job.\n\n\u201cI thought they got better as the game went on. Particularly the third period was better,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cBut like I said, it\u2019s a little more scrambly than normal and some people weren\u2019t always in the spots they were supposed to be in. But that\u2019s part of the process. Like I said, talking to all ranges of guys from the most skilled, elite players to guys that are playing their first game, that first one is not ever easy \u2026 I think they both can play better than they did tonight, and they will.\u201d\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s game against the St. Louis Blues, top players like Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom got their first work of the preseason. Newly acquired players Radko Gudas and Richard Panik scored goals, and Backstrom netted the game-winner with seven seconds remaining for Washington to win 3-2.\n\nThe Capitals reduced their training camp roster to 44 players Thursday with four preseason games to go. They play one more at home, Saturday against the Carolina Hurricanes, before the final three come on the road.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
