In all caps, she wrote, \u201cYALL\u2026IF WE KEEP THIS UP FOR 2 MORE WEEKS\u2026TRUTH HURTS COULD BE THE LONGEST FEMALE RAP #1 OF ALL TIME\u2026..RIGHT NOW ITS \u2018FANCY\u2019 CAN WE DO IT?!\u201d She also shared a screenshot of the top 10 chart with the comment, \u201cI AM BLESSED.\u201d\n\nAs Lizzo points out, Azalea\u2019s bombastic 2014 hit \u201cFancy\u201d currently holds the title. At the time, it was impossible to turn on the radio without hearing the Australian rapper declare, in a forced, unnatural Southern-American twang, \u201cFirst things first, I\u2019m the realest.\u201d A then-relatively unknown Charli XCX belted out the catchy hook that haunted the airwaves for months. It resided at the top of the charts for six consecutive weeks. \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d would need to hang onto the spot for two more weeks for Lizzo to beat Azalea\u2019s record.\n\nIggy fans immediately spammed Lizzo\u2019s tweet with defensive and sometimes toxic replies, essentially declaring war on the Lizzo fandom (also known as Lizzbians). People called her \u201cdesperate\u201d and said \u201cFancy\u201d would still be a better song regardless of whether or not \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d manages to surpass it in popularity. Lizzo knows, maybe better than most, that stans will disregard all boundaries when it comes to protecting their faves. She followed up her initial tweet with a clarification. \u201cFancy is a BOP and my homie @charli_xcx is genius on it,\u201d she wrote. \u201c(STREAM CHARLI- HER NEW ALBUM NOW).\u201d\n\nThere was just one small problem: the 31-year-old neglected to mention Iggy at all, naturally inciting the wrath of Azaleans and even the rapper herself. This is, after all, a woman who once feuded with a British cartoon pig from a children\u2019s television show. Many interpreted the omission as a snub. In a since-deleted tweet, Azalea responded, \u201cI could have sworn I was the one rapping that song but okay\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Aussie went on to jokingly encourage fans to stream the Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello earworm \u201cSe\u00f1orita\u201d (aka the couple\u2019s desperate attempt to convince skeptics that their relationship is more than just a PR stunt), which is trailing \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d at No. 2 on the charts. \u201cStream se\u00f1orita for clear skin,\u201d Azalea tweeted with a link to the music video.\n\nDemonstrating her commitment to the beef, or perhaps just desperate to milk her fleeting spot on the trending topics list, Azalea even temporarily changed her Twitter display name to \u201cIGGY AZALEA stream se\u00f1orita\u201d and swapped her avatar for a photo of Shawn and Camila. Later on Monday evening, Azalea walked back her comments, tweeting, \u201clisten I\u2019m down to be petty in the name of a laugh or two but in all seriousness, I\u2019m just trolling and laughing at all of the funny replies. I promise it\u2019s not serious; at least not for me.\u201d Lizzo appeared to take the high road by not responding to Azalea\u2019s trolling.\n\nOne-sided celebrity catfight aside, Lizzo surpassing Azalea would be a satisfying victory for some hip-hop fans. The latter has long been a controversial figure in the music world for being, as one Gawker writer put it, \u201crap\u2019s best drag queen,\u201d adopting an effortful blaccent that diverges significantly from the soft-spoken Aussie intonation of her speaking voice and borrowing the flow of rappers native to the American South. Born Amethyst Amelia Kelly, the white, blonde-haired performer has also come under fire in the past for making racist and homophobic remarks on Twitter\u2014from referring to herself as a \u201crunaway slave-master\u201d to mocking \u201chomos\u201d and \u201cdyke bitches\u201d\u2014while simultaneously benefiting from appropriating black culture.\n\nLizzo, on the other hand, is a vocal champion of embracing one\u2019s genuine self with confidence, infusing her music and her interviews with empowering messages about self-love. In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this year, the singer said, \u201cWhen I have to make decisions, I always choose honesty and I always stay true to myself, because I know at the end of the day that is what\u2019s going to remain. That is what\u2019s going to be the legend: that I was true to myself and that I honored every person by staying truthful to them.\u201d\n\nFor someone like Lizzo\u2014a body-positive black woman who trades in self-love and, above all, authenticity\u2014to claim the title of female rapper with the longest-lasting No. 1 single would be nothing short of a restoration of justice.", "description": "One is a genuine black woman who preaches self-love; the other is an Australian impostor who fakes a Southern \u201cblaccent.\u201d", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570054485/191002-Julian-Lizzo-Iggy-Azalea-tease_vxuxb2"}
