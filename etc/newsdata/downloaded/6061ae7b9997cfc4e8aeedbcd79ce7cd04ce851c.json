He was found not guilty of murder.\n\nThe younger Scandirito initially claimed his father, 74, was missing after not returning from a kayaking trip, but later told police he\u2019d found the former Macomb County judge dead after an apparent cocaine overdose and panicked, the AP and The Palm Beach Post said. He later testified he\u2019d used a saw to cut up his father\u2019s body in his garage, then hid the pieces at a construction site and the old golf course because he was afraid.\n\nScandirito faces up to 15 year in prison when he is sentenced in June.\n\nThe elder Scandirito resigned from the Macomb County court bench in 2000 after sexual misconduct allegations, the AP said.\n\nWomen had accused him of offering leniency for their charges in return for sexual favors, the Palm Beach Post has reported. The state of Michigan revoked his judge\u2019s license in 2002.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tanda Gmiter", "Tgmiter Mlive.Com"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VYLYIOILQZHM5GODN57ULYCD7U.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-22"}
