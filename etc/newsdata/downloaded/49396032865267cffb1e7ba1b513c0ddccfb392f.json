Now it's time to make that money last. So how far does $1 million actually go in retirement?\n\nTo determine how long a $1 million retirement fund would last, personal-finance website SmartAsset looked at average expenses for seniors, including food, health care, transportation, housing and utilities, cost of living and investment returns in major U.S. cities.\n\nThe site used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the nonprofit Council for Community and Economic Research to calculate how many years a $1 million portfolio would cover in each place, including any investment returns earned.\n\nThe majority of the locations where $1 million would last the longest can be found in the South, which is unsurprising, considering the region's low cost of living. In places like Memphis, Tennessee, and McAllen, Texas, residents can expect $1 million in retirement savings to last close to three decades, as opposed to large, coastal cities, such as Los Angeles and New York, where it would only last about half of that time.\n\nHere's a closer look at the 10 U.S. cities where a $1 million retirement portfolio would last the longest.", "description": "To determine how long a $1 million retirement fund would last, SmartAsset looked at average expenses for seniors, cost of living and investment returns in major U.S. cities.", "authors": ["Emmie Martin"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106165351-1570210949971nominated-on-aug-9-vacation-time-summertime-summer-holiday-relax-relaxing-pool-swimming-pool-leisure_t20_b8kyx6.jpg?v=1570211044", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
