They allege the teacher turned Herndon High into his private hunting ground, victimizing \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of students for more than a year.\n\nThe alleged crime was massive and hiding in plain sight, but it nearly went undiscovered. Police said they found Schklowsky\u2019s collection only after he was arrested in a separate incident.\n\nThe case is the latest in a virulent new strain of voyeurism enabled by technology. The ubiquity of cellphones, ever smaller cameras and drones have allowed voyeurs to operate with ease and stealth. They have invaded a host of spaces once deemed safe, including the ritual bath of a Jewish temple, a gynecologist\u2019s office, the upper floor apartments of a high-rise building and the bathroom of a police station.\n\nVoyeurs have created online communities, where they share and sell work, trade tips and egg each other on toward more and more exploitative photos and videos. In the process, victims are often exposed to exponentially more eyeballs.\n\nExperts say the confluence of factors have allowed voyeurs to operate longer without being caught and cause greater damage.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more victims than ever before,\u201d said Fairfax County police Maj. Ed O\u2019Carroll.\n\nThere are no national statistics on voyeurism, but some data indicate a sharp rise in prosecutions. A Washington Post analysis showed voyeurism cases jumped 46 percent in Virginia between 2014 and 2018, while arrests in Florida exploded by more than 600 percent between 2012 and 2018.\n\nA number of states \u2014 including Alabama, Georgia and Massachusetts \u2014 have rushed to ban \u201cupskirt\u201d photos that were often legal in public places and strengthen penalties for surreptitious filming, but advocates say more still needs to be done. Upskirting is so pervasive in South Korea that Seoul has tasked 8,000 municipal workers with sweeping bathrooms for cameras.\n\nSchklowsky\u2019s case and others have prompted a sickening sense of violation and a lingering fear that no place is truly off limits.\n\n\u201cSchool is somewhere you come to think of as a safe space,\u201d said the teen who was one of the victims. \u201cSchool is somewhere where you go seven hours a day to learn, to thrive and be with your friends. It gives me a lot of anxiety to think about going back to school. It doesn\u2019t feel as safe as before.\u201d\n\nAn uneasy feeling\n\nWhile some teachers ban cellphones in class, Schklowsky embraced technology, students said. Schklowsky, who usually had his phone out, would often ask students to use their phones to complete online exercises or surveys.\n\nThe teen said Schklowsky gave her an uneasy feeling from the start. She recalled that he scolded her for being on \u201cthe wrong path\u201d after she told him she would not be trying out for a play. The response seemed over the top.\n\nEven though her guard was up around him, she never had an inkling that he might be filming her.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think he was doing anything other than texting his wife or doing what we were doing in class,\u201d the teen said.\n\nThe Post is not naming the teen, nor her family members, because it generally does not reveal the identities of juvenile crime victims. The girl said she wanted to share her story to warn others and spoke with the permission of her mother.\n\nSchklowsky, who taught drama and directed school plays, had been at Herndon High School since August 2016. Students said he told them he had attended a performing arts high school in New York and studied the Stanislavski acting method in Russia. He lives in Reston with his family, and an online r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says he previously worked as a teacher in New York City.\n\nHis attorney, who declined to comment, said in court that Schklowsky has been attending a treatment program in Pennsylvania for people with sexually compulsive behavior.\n\nOther Herndon students said they often saw Schklowsky wandering the halls with his iPhone clipped to his waist. Police said Schklowsky took photos and videos all over the school, snapping students as they inadvertently exposed themselves.\n\nBut the iPhone was not Schklowsky\u2019s only tool, authorities allege.\n\nHe stashed at least one small camera in a drama department changing room to capture students as they undressed, police said. Such cameras are part of a generation of devices so small they can be hidden almost anywhere.\n\nVoyeurs have also turned to a range of devices embedded with cameras. A Johns Hopkins gynecologist filmed women with cameras in pens and phone chargers. A D.C. rabbi used a clock radio with a hidden camera to shoot women who were undressing for a ritual bath. A thriving online marketplace has even more devices: miniature cameras embedded in sneaker tops, shaving cream cans, electric razors and scales.\n\n\u201cYou look at the equipment our partners in state and federal law enforcement have and you look at the equipment you can get off Amazon, and there\u2019s really not much of a difference,\u201d Fairfax County police 2nd Lt. David Koenigsberg said.\n\nPerhaps the most unsettling new tool is the drone.\n\nMichele Dunn, an Atlanta lobbyist, said she caught something out of the corner of her eye as she entered the bedroom of her fourth floor condo in a towel after a shower in 2018. There was a drone outside her bedroom window.\n\n\u201cI really thought it was a bird at first . . . and then it hovered,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWhat really creeped me out and made me scream was that I saw the camera zooming in on my window. It was like an eye.\u201d\n\nDunn\u2019s husband charged into the bedroom and threw open the window, staring at the drone for a second before it flew around the high-rise. Dunn said her husband called the building concierge, who found men operating it in a parking lot. They quickly drove off.\n\nNo arrests have been made.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer,\u201d Dunn said of the new technology before referencing a movie about a man who spies on his neighbors with a telephoto lens. \u201cIt\u2019s not Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u2018Rear Window\u2019 anymore.\u201d\n\nCatching an alleged predator\n\nThe Schklowskys\u2019 au pair had a nagging fear.\n\nEver since a former au pair told her she found a camera hidden in the closet of her bedroom in the family\u2019s home, the woman, 19, wondered whether she was being watched, according to a search warrant.\n\nThe woman began to comb her bedroom. In April, she peered into a vent and found a camera attached to a transmitting device, the search warrant said.\n\nMinutes later, Schklowsky asked to speak with her, saying he knew she had discovered the device, according to the search warrant.\n\nWhen the au pair spoke with Schklowsky and his wife, the wife told her Schklowsky had trust issues with au pairs and it would be \u201cserious\u201d if she went to police, according to the search warrant.\n\nThe au pair did just that.\n\nSchklowsky was charged that same week with misdemeanor unlawful filming. Police said they recovered 32 phones, memory sticks, computers, a smoke detector outfitted with a camera and other devices from his home.\n\nOn the very last device, investigators found the Herndon High School collection that was amassed between May 2017 and June 2018. Police were able to identify 10 students captured in the photos and videos. Schklowsky was charged in June with felony unlawful filming counts in each case. His case is pending.\n\nThe mother of the teen victim said the girl called detectives to arrange a meeting. \u201cShe said to them, \u2018I have questions I want answered,\u2019 \u201d the mother said.\n\nAt the teen\u2019s request, detectives who came to her home laid out three sheets of paper, showing her the photos of her they had found. The teen was furious. She was disgusted. But she said she needed to know details to move forward.\n\n\u201cIt made me upset that I was so unaware. I was in school doing essentially what I was supposed to be doing,\u201d the teen said. \u201cI feel so out of control and upset that it happened to me. I think I\u2019m trying to take back that control.\u201d\n\nThe teen said she is prepared to testify if Schklowsky goes to trial, but detectives told her most cases like his end in a plea deal.\n\nThe teen said she was relieved police have not found evidence the Herndon High photos were shared online, as has happened in other cases.\n\nEarlier this year, a victim of another alleged voyeur in Fairfax County was on Tumblr when he stumbled across a video of himself naked in a dressing room at Centreville\u2019s Spa World, according to a search warrant. The man alerted police, who discovered the voyeur was allegedly running a business selling lewd videos of victims under the Twitter handle @OGshowerspy. Police said he made thousands of dollars and victimized more than 160 people.\n\nVoyeurs share similar videos on dozens of other forums and porn sites. In recent years, public outcry forced Reddit and Tumblr to shut down large communities based around \u201ccreepshots,\u201d photos or videos of body parts taken in public without the victims\u2019 consent. One Tumblr blog devoted to creepshots had 11,000 followers, while another gave detailed instructions on how to take higher quality photos with a variety of phones.\n\nThe Schklowsky case has prompted anger and anxiety in the Herndon High School community. Dozens of students and parents gathered in an auditorium in late June, peppering school officials and police with questions about the case.\n\nOne mother said her daughter wondered if she could ever change her clothes in the school. Another sobbed, as she demanded to know how the school would prevent similar cases in the future.\n\nPrincipal Elizabeth Noto said they would make sure no cameras were stationed in classrooms anymore and have counselors on hand to help students.\n\n\u201cOur trust was completely violated by this man,\u201d Noto said.\n\nNo charges for personal drug possession: Seattle\u2019s bold gamble to being \u2018peace\u2019 after the war on drugs\n\nFound insane in one killing, police say D.C. man killed again\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not giving you the power\u2019: Sister confronts twin\u2019s killer in Va. courtroom\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Even as he taught a drama class, police said, Raphael Schklowsky was victimizing his students.", "authors": ["Justin Jouvenal", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Policing"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JBN56IGVQ4I6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
