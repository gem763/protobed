They then fled either by motorboat or jet-ski via the vast system of lakes west of Stockholm.\n\nThe probe was headed by the Swedish police's National Operations Department, local police and Sweden's National Unit against Organised Crime, an office specialised in combating organised, cross-border crime.\n\nThe theft has been logged at Interpol, which enables an international search.\n\nThe stolen artifacts are so-called funeral regalia, which are placed inside or on top of a coffin to symbolise a deceased royal's identity and social ranking.\n\nWhile some funeral regalia are kept in the cathedrals of Strangnas, Uppsala and Vasteras, Sweden's crown jewels are in vaults under the Royal Castle in Stockholm.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "A person has been arrested over the theft of priceless treasures from the Swedish royal regalia, including a jewelled crown, from a cathedral where they were on display, Swedish authorities say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5535/53a5f33e192043659defa9443c801dfa.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-13"}
