(Oct. 28) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Democrats leading the House of Representatives released an eight-page resolution Tuesday that outlines how the next phase of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump will operate, offering both sides of the aisle subpoena power as committees embark on public hearings.\n\nThe resolution from Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., could be voted on as early as Thursday. It makes clear that information gathered by the six committees that have been conducting oversight into Trump would funnel to the House Judiciary Committee \u2013 the panel that has traditionally been charged with impeachment.\n\n\"None of us came to Congress to impeach a president \u2013 but each of us took a solemn oath to protect and defend the Constitution,\" McGovern said. \"While the president and his allies try to obstruct our investigation and cover up his wrongdoing, the House will continue to do its job and uncover the truth for the American people.\"\n\nThe Thursday vote on the resolution will mark the first time House members will be forced to vote on the inquiry after weeks of intense criticism by the GOP and put several moderate Democrats and Republicans under close scrutiny as the 2020 election approaches.\n\nWar of words:: 'Everybody has read your words on the call': Pelosi responds to Trump tweets on impeachment\n\nThe rules appear tailored to meet complaints that Republicans have made for weeks about closed-door depositions that three key committees \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 have been holding with witnesses from the State Department and national security offices. Republicans argued that Democrats were holding secret impeachment hearings in the basement of the Capitol.\n\nBut it wasn't enough to appease concerns and Republicans in leadership urged their colleagues to vote against the measure. GOP lawmakers argued the resolution did not include additional resources for conservative lawmakers leading the committees where impeachment would take place and failed to detail whether the president and his attorneys could be present for the hearings, offer evidence or cross-examine witnesses.\n\nThe White House denounced the measure in a statement by Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, saying the resolution continues the impeachment \"scam\" without allowing \"any due process for the President.\"\n\n\"The White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee,\" she said. \"Even then, the White House's rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain \u2013 because those rules still haven\u2019t been written.\"\n\nLater on Tuesday, Democrats released a three-page summary that outlined the role of the president and his counsel once impeachment moves to the Judiciary Committee. It includes that both the president and his counsel may cross-examine witnesses, offer evidence and craft a closing presentation.\n\nBut it all comes with a caveat \u2014 all requests would have to be approved by Democrats and would be rejected should the administration block witnesses or documents from being made available.\n\nThe resolution broadly outlines the plan for public hearings to take place in the House Intelligence Committee, which has led the investigation into Trump asking Ukraine to investigate political rivals \u2013 the central focus of the impeachment investigation.\n\nBoth Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. and Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, would have subpoena power and be given up to 90 minutes together to question witnesses during public hearings \u2013 or have staffers ask questions.\n\nBut subpoenas from Nunes, R-Calif., would first have to be approved by Schiff, who can reject such requests. Any rejection could be brought to the full committee for a vote, the resolution notes.\n\nThe measure also directs the Intelligence Committee to craft a report on its findings and offer it to the House Judiciary Committee, which under the resolution would also offer subpoena power to both parties on the panel \u2013 Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican.\n\nMore: More than 80% of Republicans say seeking foreign help in elections is not OK, poll finds\n\nThe resolution says the inquiry would continue under six committees: Financial Services, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, Judiciary, Oversight and Reform, and Ways and Means, all of which have been investigating the president.\n\nThree committees \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 have been holding closed-door depositions with State Department and national security officials to learn more about Trump\u2019s demand for Ukrainian investigations while he withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for the country.\n\nBut other committees have continued work on other aspects of the investigation, which the resolution says would also be funneled to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nCLOSE Impeaching a U.S. president might not be the be-all-end-all for their career. We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nThe chairmen of the four most active panels \u2013 Schiff; Nadler; Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., at Oversight; and Rep. Eliot Engle, D-N.Y., at Foreign Affairs \u2013 issued a joint statement saying that the inquiry \u201chas collected extensive evidence and testimony, and soon the American people will hear from witnesses in an open setting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a President who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election,\u201d the chairmen said. \u201cFollowing in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the President\u2019s misconduct.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24 amid reports that Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, while withholding military aid. White House counsel Pat Cipollone notified Pelosi Oct. 8 that the administration wouldn\u2019t cooperate for lack of a full House vote.\n\nRead the resolution:\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/29/impeachment-inquiry-resolution-republican-subpoena/2499114001/", "description": "The House released a resolution Tuesday outlining the next phase of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, offering Republicans subpoena power as hearings move into public view.", "authors": ["Christal Hayes", "Bart Jansen", "Published P.M.
