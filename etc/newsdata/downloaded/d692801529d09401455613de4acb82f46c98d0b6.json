And that\u2019s the absolute best strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Friends ended in May 2004 it felt like the end of an era, but just four months later Matt LeBlanc was already back on our screens with Joey, which was almost unanimously summed up as everything wrong with a sitcom sequel. The Big Bang Theory needs to learn from its errors if we\u2019re ever going to revisit the likes of Sheldon (played by Jim Parsons), Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Penny (Kaley Cuoco).\n\nJoey was axed midway through its second run and while there might have been unreasonable expectations after it followed on from an absolute ratings juggernaut \u2013 which is still regarded as almost the gold standard for sitcoms \u2013 it just didn\u2019t hit the mark.\n\nKevin S. Bright \u2013 who was a direct and executive producer on both \u2013 has admitted in the past that the spin-off just didn\u2019t have the same tone as its predecessor, and while Friends portrayed Joey Tribbiani as a lovable, carefree goof, that all changed when the follow up saw him move to Hollywood and try to grow up.\n\nJoey was a bitter pill to swallow for Friends fans (Picture: NBC)\n\nThere was also an issue with how the character transformed from a real ladies\u2019 man \u2013 literally one of his key defining characteristics \u2013 into someone without many friends, and also lacking in the skills to even really land a date. That doesn\u2019t sound like the Joey we knew and loved, and it\u2019s that kind of disregard for what\u2019s come before that The Big Bang Theory team need to avoid if any potential spin-offs can even hope to retain some goodwill from a passionate fanbase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine a Sheldon sequel \u2013 which is unlikely considering Jim Parsons doesn\u2019t seem keen on a reprise \u2013 where the character suddenly exudes charm, where he\u2019s a real ladies man and where he\u2019s an expect in the nuances of societal etiquette.\n\nOr where Penny\u2019s quirks give way to a book smart character struggling to land a man.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t sound right, and it\u2019s these Joey traps The Big Bang Theory crew would have to avoid.\n\nThere also needs to be a reason for the next story being told, and that\u2019s where the Friends team may have also let LeBlanc\u2019s show down by rushing out the sequel less than half a year after its predecessor went off the air.\n\nSure, there\u2019s something to be said for striking when the iron is hot, but look at how seemingly everyone online is clamouring for a Friends reunion or one-off comeback. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, while hot shotting out a cash-in can leave a bad taste for even the most passionate of fanbases.\n\nSo, TBBT bosses have got to take their time, let fans really miss having these characters around, and let the feeling of nostalgia grow as we start to wonder what happened to them after we last checked in.\n\nLeonard and Penny were firm favourites for a spin-off with Big Bang Theory fans (Photo by Michael Yarish/CBS via Getty Images)\n\nThen, it\u2019s down to them to figure out where their stories have gone \u2013 making sure they actually fit into what was established over a decade of television \u2013 and then see how they can turn it into something that seems natural and worthwhile rather than forced and unnecessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig Bang Theory has emulated Friends in many ways by becoming a true modern day classic sitcom which will almost definitely stand the test of time. Now, if there is any hope for a reprise in the future, it needs to learn one more lesson from the past and make sure we\u2019re not still talking about a doomed Raj (Kunal Nayyar) spin-off in 15 years\u2019 time.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
