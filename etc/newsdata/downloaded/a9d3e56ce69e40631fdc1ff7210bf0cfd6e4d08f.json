Protesters and police have both deployed levels of violence unseen since the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nSecurity officers pursue pro-democracy lawmaker Au Nok-hin, center, as he runs across desks to chase Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam leaving a question and answer session with lawmakers at the Legislative Council in Hong Kong, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019.
