The terminus is therefore seen as a symbol of Beijing\u2019s encroachment on semi-autonomous Hong Kong by many protesters, whose push for greater political freedom has taken on an increasingly anti-China tone over five months of unrest.\n\nMany marchers wore masks in contravention of a government ban on facial coverings at public assemblies, meant to deter participation in protests. Others carried Catalonian flags in solidarity with the secessionist movement that has thrown Spain in crisis.\n\nThe protesters chanted \u201cStand with Hong Kong! Fight for Freedom!\u201d and called for full democracy for the enclave\u2019s 7.4 million people, who are presently ruled by a Beijing-backed official selected by a so-called \u201celection committee\u201d of just 1,200 members of mostly business and establishment backgrounds.\n\nThe shuttered shopfronts of mainland Chinese businesses were vandalized as the march made its way up the \u201cGolden Mile\u201d of Nathan Road\u2014the prime tourist strip\u2014passing five-star hotels, including the Peninsula hotel, Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cgrande dame,\u201d built in 1928. Branches of the Bank of China were broken into and ransacked before being set on fire. Government offices were defaced and petrol bombs were hurled over the walls of a police station and into subway stations, forcing the closure of several. Protesters also threw bricks at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannon, pursuing protesters up Nathan Road and into the Jordan district.\n\nOutside Chungking Mansions\u2014an iconic, 1960s commercial building that is home to a shifting population of traders from the Sub-Continent and sub-Saharan Africa\u2014a prominent group of South Asians stood in \u201cI Love HK\u201d shirts, expressing support for the marchers.\n\nTensions have grown between Hong Kong\u2019s ethnic minorities and protesters, who accuse South Asian gangs of acting as thugs for hire, paid by Triad criminal organizations and other shady groups to intimidate and beat up protesters. Jimmy Sham, convenor of march organizer the Civil and Human Rights Front, was hospitalized after being attacked by a gang of non-Chinese men Wednesday. He sent a message from hospital appealing for racial calm: \u201cDo not label anyone by ethnicity in the movement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI believe that, everyone who joins this path to democracy are our brothers and sisters, regardless of nationality, language, color and race.\u201d\n\nMany on the march expressed shock and sympathy for Sham. \u201cWe came out today because the man was chopped in the street\u2014It really upset me,\u201d said Ching, 33. \u201cI had to come out, especially this time.\u201d\n\nThe march comes at the end of a week of tumultuous politics, even by Hong Kong standards. On Wednesday, the enclave\u2019s top official, the increasingly isolated Carrie Lam, was prevented by unruly lawmakers from giving her annual policy address at the Legislative Council, and fled the room to calls for her ouster. On the following day, a question-and-answer session with Lam and legislators degenerated into similarly chaotic scenes.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protests began in June as opposition to a detested (and now withdrawn) bill that Lam attempted to fast track. The bill would have made it possible, for the first time, for criminal fugitives to be extradited to mainland China. Fearing that Beijing would use the provision to round up dissidents and critics in the enclave, Hongkongers rose en masse, with millions taking to the streets.\n\nThe protests have since become increasingly violent and their aims have broadened to include full democracy, self-determination and even independence for Hong Kong, which has infuriated Beijing. China regards the Hong Kong protests as a color revolution and President Xi Jinping has warned that \u201cAnyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.\u201d\n\n\u2014With reporting by Amy Gunia and Abhishyant Kidangoor / Hong Kong\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Tens of thousands of anti-communist protesters rallied at the high-speed rail terminus, seen as a symbol of Beijing's encroachment.", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1176982624.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
