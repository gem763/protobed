He will sell himself as the man who extracted Britain from the European Union, at long last, and set out to strike great new trade deals with Europe and the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAnd if Brexit stalls? Then Johnson is planning to campaign against the establishment \u2014 against the devious lawmakers, overreaching jurists and other elites who conspired to deny the country its freedom from the European Union. (Nevermind that Johnson is a scion of wealth and privilege \u2014 a diplomat\u2019s son, schooled at Eton and Oxford, who went on to become a celebrity journalist and politician with a country home.)\n\nAD\n\nIn either case, if Conservatives are going to win, they\u2019re going to need to win over people who live in places like Wigan.\n\nWigan\u2019s voters have gone for Labour ever since the center-left party was born. The city has sent a Labour lawmaker to Parliament in every general election since 1918. Its city council has been dominated by Labour for generations; today the party holds 57 of 75 seats.\n\nAD\n\nBut Wigan ignored Labour\u2019s London-based leaders in June 2016 and voted enthusiastically \u2014 64 percent \u2014 to leave the European Union.\n\nWigan wanted, and more important, still wants Brexit, according to the opinion surveys.\n\nSo the question in a general election will be: Will \u201cLabour Leavers\u201d stray from the comfort of their traditional political home \u2014 to either defend Brexit or get Brexit done?\n\nSomewhere between 3 million and 4 million British Labour voters backed Brexit. That\u2019s a lot of potential swing voters.\n\nAD\n\nIn the May elections for the European Parliament, a resounding 41 percent of voters in Wigan backed political gadfly Nigel Farage\u2019s upstart, single-issue Brexit Party, pushing Labour into second place, as it shed a fifth of its votes from 2014.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was so bad, I try not to think about it,\u201d said Gareth Flynn, a local Labour organizer.\n\nLocal volunteers are the foot soldiers in British general elections. They pass out leaflets and make their case door-to-door, urging their neighbors to show up at the polls.\n\nAnd what these volunteers see and hear in the Midlands and northern England is that Johnson is a decent salesman. They detect that Brexit is as popular as ever, maybe even more so, especially among voters who feel like they\u2019ve been ignored \u2014 or slandered as gullible, xenophobic, closet racists too ignorant to see all the upsides of continued membership in the world\u2019s largest trade bloc.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were told, \u2018You\u2019ve never had it so good,\u2019 but Wigan never really felt the benefit of the European Union,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cWe know we sent more money to Europe than we\u2019ve got back. We\u2019re not fools.\u201d\n\nFlynn recalls distributing Labour leaflets in 2016 that highlighted how remaining in the E.U. would mean cheaper mobile phone bills when people traveled in Europe.\n\n\u201cSon, I haven\u2019t been on proper holiday in four years,\u201d passersby told him. \u201cRoaming charges in the south of France wasn\u2019t cutting it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is a very, very strong sense of anger in towns like mine,\u201d Wigan\u2019s member of Parliament, Lisa Nandy, said on a Guardian podcast last month.\n\n\u201cWe asked people to come out, we asked them what they thought, we asked them to choose. And now we\u2019re saying, actually, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve decided differently,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it feeds that sense of being alienated from the political system, and a political system that just simply doesn\u2019t care what people think.\u201d\n\nNandy has tried to bridge conflicting positions on Brexit. In a challenge to her party\u2019s leadership this past week, she supported moving Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal forward in the approval process \u201cto see if we can improve this deal and keep people\u2019s trust in our democracy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn assured Nandy that he understood concerns in constituencies like hers, adding, \u201cI know that she joins me in being pretty alarmed at the way in which manufacturing industry is under stress at the moment\u201d and could leave Britain as the result of a sharp break with the E.U.\n\nThe message to Labour Leavers: We\u2019re still fighting for you.\n\nOn the facade of Wigan\u2019s Victorian, red-brick City Hall, there\u2019s a plaque that reads: \u201cBy the end of the 19th century Wigan was one of the most important mining centers in the country, upwards of a thousand pit shafts having been sunk within five miles of the town.\u201d\n\nAuthor George Orwell reported on the living conditions of the miners here in a 1937 social history, \u201cThe Road to Wigan Pier.\u201d He described the coal pits as \u201ca place like hell,\u201d the work crushing, death-dealing. He wrote about a \u201cmonstrous scenery of slag heaps, chimneys, piled scrap iron, foul canals,\u201d where the boardinghouses served \u201cvile food\u201d to day-wage slaves living in slums, filled with \u201csickly aging people creeping round and round them like black beetles.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWigan still has some aging miners, although the coal pits have been closed for decades. Heinz is the largest employer now.\n\nThe mayor of Wigan, Steve Dawber, is old-school Labour, a retired union rep who spent three decades at the Heinz processing plant on the edge of town. The plant employed 14,000 workers when Dawber started there in 1979, loading boxes of beans onto pallets. It employs 1,200 today, while churning out more product than ever before, an amazing billion cans of baked beans a year.\n\n\u201cAutomation and artificial intelligence,\u201d said Dawber, that\u2019s what is changing the British worker\u2019s life.\n\nOn top of those changes, the mayor said, Wigan was hit hard by the \u201causterity budgets\u201d pushed through by the Conservative Party governments of David Cameron and Theresa May. The city council had to find $175 million in cuts. It struggled to provide basic services. Charities had to step in to keep swimming pools and libraries open.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDawber is proud they didn\u2019t raise local taxes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a poor town,\u201d he said. \u201cWe go up a fiver a month on the council tax, a lot of people would suffer. You don\u2019t believe it? They don\u2019t have the extra fiver. They\u2019d have less than nothing.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said that in Wigan, \u201cEurope is for somebody else.\u201d\n\nAs a political candidate, Dawber said, \u201cif you tell people here you want to remain, you might as well shoot yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had a second referendum, Wigan would vote for no deal,\u201d he said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if we were missing our European medicines, if no European foods came. We\u2019d make do. That\u2019s the thinking.\u201d\n\nWilliam Mallory is the candidate the new Brexit Party has selected to stand in Wigan in the next general election. He works as a contractor in the civil service, an accountant, and travels three days a week to London.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t stopped believing, haven\u2019t changed our minds about Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all details of a deal versus no-deal. We just want out.\u201d\n\nIn a general election, with Brexit still undone, he doubted that his Labour Leaver neighbors would pivot to Johnson\u2019s Conservatives.\n\n\u201cThey just can\u2019t,\u201d Mallory said. There\u2019s too much baggage. \u201cTheir fathers, their fathers\u2019 fathers and on and on, they voted Labour.\u201d It\u2019s in their DNA.\n\n\u201cThe Tories can\u2019t represent people here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the establishment, no matter what Boris says. They are the owners, not the workers. This is a working-class city. There\u2019s not many millionaires in Wigan. There\u2019s no lords and ladies here.\u201d\n\nMichael Winstanley, leader of the group of eight Conservatives on the Wigan council, assessed that at least some of the local voters seem willing to back Johnson.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen I go out and give leaflets, a lot of people say to me, \u2018Boris is going to get us out,\u2019 \u201d Winstanley said. \u201cThat message that Boris Johnson is constantly playing? It seems to be going down well. People say, \u2018At least I know what he\u2019s all about.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWinstanley said that Labour\u2019s muddled position \u2014 or nuanced, take your pick \u2014 has made locals \u201cfeel like the Labour Party isn\u2019t theirs anymore.\u201d\n\nAt Labour\u2019s annual conference last month, Corbyn beat back a grass-roots push by his members to declare themselves a pro-Remain party.\n\nInstead, the party\u2019s position is: Let Johnson fail at delivering Brexit by Oct. 31; then stage a general election; beat the Conservatives; negotiate a Labour Brexit deal with Brussels; then decide as a party whether to take that deal; then put it before the voters in a second referendum.\n\nFlynn, the Labour door-knocker, said that was the best position \u2014 the most ethical one. But he was a little worried.", "description": "Britain is bracing for elections.", "authors": ["William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LMoBdu1iVP_8ELQpL97aAZW97XY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MX4JHEHFFII6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
