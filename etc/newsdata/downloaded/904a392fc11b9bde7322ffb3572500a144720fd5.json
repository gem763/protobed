It wasn\u2019t an easy session for traders to get reacquainted with though. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: Twitter\n\ntop stock trades for TWTR More\n\nTwitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock have been moving really well and even on Tuesday, the early price action looked promising. Shares were trying to breakout of an ascending triangle, a bullish setup where rising uptrend support continues to squeeze a stock against a static level of resistance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat resistance came into play around $43. The stock was swiftly rejected from this level while the broader market was under notable pressure.\n\nHowever, uptrend support (blue line) is still holding strong, while the 20-day moving average is just below current levels.\n\nIf these marks give way, $40 is on the table. A move over $43 could still trigger a breakout, but TWTR needs to close over this level.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: Walmart\n\ntop stock trades for WMT More\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) stock also continues to trade relatively well so far this month. However, the stock continues to struggle with this $114 to $115 level.\n\nIn the last two months, WMT has found itself in this area on three separate occasions. Each test of $115 comes following a higher low, as highlighted by the purple arrows on the chart above.\n\nIf the overall market falls apart, it will be harder for WMT stock to breakout. However, shares are sitting right under the trigger spot. A close over $115 could cause an even larger move to the upside, with $120 on many traders\u2019 radar.\n\nOn the downside, I would really like to see the 20-day and 50-day moving averages hold as support.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Cleveland-Cliffs\n\ntop stock trades for CLF More\n\nCleveland Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) is getting hammered on the day, falling about 15% on Tuesday. It\u2019s more than just a tough day though, as CLF falls below its 200-week moving average.\n\nShould CLF reclaim this area and hold it by Friday\u2019s close, bulls can breathe a sigh of relief. However, a close below this mark puts the $6 mark on the table for the struggling stock.\n\nShares were putting in a series of lower highs (blue line) above the $10 mark, and since breaking down over the past few months, CLF has lost almost 50% from its 2019 highs. Down seven weeks in a row has made this one a tough stock to own.\n\nLet\u2019s see if CLF gets down to $6 and how it responds if it does. From here, investors either need to see CLF reclaim the 200-week or test $6. We\u2019ll have a better idea on CLF after that.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Invitae\n\ntop stock trades for NVTA More", "description": "Tuesday marked the first trading session of September, as well as the first session in the holiday-shortened week, with U.S. equity markets closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day.
