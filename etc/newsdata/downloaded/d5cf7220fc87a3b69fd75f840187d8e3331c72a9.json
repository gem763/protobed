Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential race, it seemed only one of them \u2013 Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. \u2013 was officially aboard the Bernie Bus:\n\nAs for the others:\n\n-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had made no official endorsement but was still rumored to be attending a Sanders rally scheduled for this weekend in Queens, N.Y. \u2013 one of two New York city boroughs that include a portion of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s home district.\n\nBIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS\n\n-- Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., clarified Wednesday that she had not yet endorsed a 2020 presidential candidate \u2013 even though CNN and Omar claimed Tlaib had backed Sanders.\n\n-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., also hadn\u2019t made an endorsement.\n\nPressley\u2019s camp stressed that while the Squad members support one another in Congress, they don\u2019t necessarily speak with one voice on all issues.\n\n\u201cAyanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service,\u201d a Pressley spokesperson told Vox. \u201cUltimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cAyanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.\u201d \u2014 Spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.\n\nOne factor possibly stalling a Pressley endorsement of Sanders: She hails from the same state as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, so she might not be as eager to oppose a presidential candidate from her home area \u2013 the way that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for example, backed former Vice President Joe Biden instead of her fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nAccording to Boston.com, Pressley\u2019s ties to the Sanders campaign aren\u2019t as strong as those of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, with Pressley having backed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. In addition, Pressley has worked with Warren on legislation in Congress and also has close relationships with Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who have been seeking her endorsement, the report said.\n\nTlaib, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t ruled out a Sanders endorsement down the road, telling the Detroit Free Press she will host the U.S. senator from Vermont in her district later this month \u2013 just as she recently did recently with Warren. (Warren posted video from that visit online Wednesday -- and Tlaib retweeted it.)\n\n\"I am looking forward to bringing Senator Sanders to Michigan on Oct. 27 for a tour of our district that will highlight economic justice issues and corporate tax giveaways, and (include) a roundtable with housing justice advocates,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cI need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen. Sanders about these critically important issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen.
