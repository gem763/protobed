The ASA wants the performance period to be extended to four years.", "description": "Transurban's chairman wants to stick around as the tollroad group's share price outperforms the S&P/ASX 200.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4801%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_775%2C$y_748/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2529a897d3ec52b5c29e48a114fc79229fc0ccb4", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
