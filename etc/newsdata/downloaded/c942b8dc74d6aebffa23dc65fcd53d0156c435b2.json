But, without a long-term understanding \u2014 and plan \u2014 for resisting Chinese IP theft and illicit tech transfers to China \u2014 the United States will inevitably become just another middle power in an increasingly Chinese-dominated world. President Trump must insist that China cease its ongoing technology war upon the United States before any kind of deal is agreed to. He must also advocate for Congress to make technology transfers illegal under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Then, the president should order America\u2019s clandestine services to wage an unremitting cyber campaign against any Chinese entity that seeks to target, steal, or destroy American intellectual property.\n\nPresident Trump: any short-term benefits that may be gleaned from negotiating with China on trade may equal a long-term strategic defeat for the United States in the ongoing struggle for supremacy between Beijing and Washington.\n\nUntil an American leader does comprehend this fact, American workers will continue to lose their livelihoods (thereby gutting the United States of once-vital middle-class communities), the American economy will lose billions of dollars to China, and the United States will become a subordinate power to China\u2019s growing hegemony.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brandon Weichert", "Spectator.Org A-Deal-With-China-Is-A-Loss-For-America"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
