It is two blocks from the First District police station and the office where homicide detectives are based.\n\nA police spokesman said the victim was found on the front steps of an apartment building. Newsham said he had been shot multiple times and that it appears he was targeted. He said the motive for the killing is not yet known.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt appears they were looking for this young man in particular,\u201d Newsham said.\n\nThe chief complained about the proliferation of illegal firearms and said consequences for people involved in violence need to be harsher. \u201cWe need to let young people know that carrying a firearm is not pretty, it is not cute,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people end up dead as a result.\u201d\n\nPolice said the shooting did not appear to be related to the fatal shooting in September of Marquette Harris, 27, who was attacked about three blocks away in the 200 block of P Street SW. No arrest has been made in that case.\n\nThe Nationals play the Los Angeles Dodgers in California on Wednesday night, but the ballpark is inviting fans to watch the game on its large television screens. Newsham said the shooting and investigation would not affect those plans.\n\nAD", "description": "The District\u2019s police chief says the victim was targeted.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
