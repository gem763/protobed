Adding a few milligrams gives a powerful kick; a few more turn deadly.\n\nIn short, most of the people exposed to\u2014and dying from\u2014fentanyl didn\u2019t think they were buying it and didn\u2019t want to use it. Rather than increasing the number of users, fentanyl is driving up the death rate.\n\nThis distinction is important: It means our traditional methods for responding to drug epidemics won\u2019t reverse the death toll. Usually government agencies focus on preventing experimentation, reducing accessibility of drugs, and treating individuals to suppress demand. These efforts remain valuable, but they won\u2019t immediately curb overdose deaths in places that are drowning in fentanyl.\n\nIt is better to conceptualize the fentanyl problem like a poisoning outbreak. The poison is out there\u2014but how can exposure to it be minimized? How can its spread to other regions be contained?", "description": "", "authors": ["Pardo Etal", "Rand.Org Blog Tackle-Fentanyl-Like-A-Poisoning-Outbreak-Not-A-Drug.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
