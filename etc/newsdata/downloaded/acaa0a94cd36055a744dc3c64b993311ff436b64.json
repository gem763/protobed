Max Rose, who now supports House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Trump, on Thursday said lawmakers have to take it seriously and put the stunts of the past behind them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is where we have to be right now,\u201d Mr. Rose, New York Democrat, said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cBut while we\u2019re on a fact-finding mission, we\u2019re also engaging [in] an effort to earn and maintain the trust of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as a consequence, it is vital \u2014 absolutely vital \u2014 that we don\u2019t \u2026 jump to conclusions, we engage in a deliberate and reasonable and fair process that earns the trust of the American people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sell \u2018Impeach the Mofo\u2019 T-shirts any longer. We can\u2019t bring chicken to hearings.

Rashida Tlaib\u2019s explicit vow shortly after the new Congress was sworn in.\n\nRep. Steve Cohen, Tennessee Democrat, also brought chicken to a hearing earlier this year at which Attorney General William P. Barr had declined to appear.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Rep.
