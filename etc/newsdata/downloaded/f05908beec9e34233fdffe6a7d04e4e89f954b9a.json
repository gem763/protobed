He relied on a walker for ambulation and his mother attended to most of his daily needs,\u201d the researchers wrote, noting that his genitals had swelled to roughly 7 pounds and were 11.8 x 9.6 x 5.1 inches.\n\nThe patient was then diagnosed with Fournier gangrene, what the National Organization for Rare Disorders describes as \u201can acute necrotic infection of the scrotum; penis; or perineum,\u201d which is the area between the anus and the genitals.\n\n\u201cIt is characterized by scrotum pain and redness with rapid progression to gangrene and sloughing of tissue. Fournier gangrene is usually secondary to perirectal or periurethral infections associated with local trauma, operative procedures, or urinary tract disease,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe condition most often affects men but has been reported in women and children in some cases. Urinary tract or bladder infections, hysterectomies and abscesses can sometimes lead to Fournier gangrene.\n\nThe man also suffered from grade 4 lymphedema on his right leg and groin \u2014 a category of swelling that\u2019s most often associated with patients with elephantiasis, according to the report. A CT scan of the man\u2019s abdomen and pelvis also revealed he was suffering from a massive hernia in his groin. He also had a large abscess and a swollen left kidney due to a buildup of urine. His flesh was also decaying.\n\nThe patient required emergency surgery to remove the infected tissue on and near his scrotum. During the procedure, doctors were forced to perform a \u201cdorsal slit\u201d to his penis \u2013 meaning it was cut lengthwise \u2013 to insert a catheter.\n\nOREGON DOCTOR SUES OVER DONATED SPERM, SAYS CLINIC USED IT FOR 17 KIDS\n\nThe man also underwent a scrotectomy, or a total or partial removal of the scrotum, they wrote, before a plastic surgery team at the hospital repaired the affected region.\n\nTwo days later, he was released to a rehab center.\n\nAt four weeks post-op, the man was \u201chealing well with satisfactory cosmetic and functional outcomes,\u201d doctors wrote in the report.", "description": "A 43-year-old Panama man was the focus of a recent case report that detailed a rare condition that caused his testicles to swell to an enormous size.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
