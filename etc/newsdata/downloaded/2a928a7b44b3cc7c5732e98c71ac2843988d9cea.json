That\u2019s a felony. The Justice Department would be remiss in its duty if it ignored the finding and let McCabe escape criminal charges.\n\nMCCABE TEAM PRESSURES DOJ TO SHOW CARDS AMID GRAND JURY SPECULATION\n\nFox News reported that U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu recommended moving forward with charges against McCabe and that Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen rejected an appeal by attorneys for McCabe to go against Liu\u2019s recommendation.\n\nLiu and Rosen made the proper decision. Just because he held a high position in the FBI does not mean that McCabe is above the law.\n\nIn the latest development in the case, Fox News reported Friday that attorneys for McCabe are trying again to get the Justice Department to drop plans to prosecute the fired FBI official, who briefly served as acting director of the bureau after James Comey was fired from the top FBI job.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s attorneys made the request citing \u201crumors from reporters starting this morning that the grand jury considering charges against Mr. McCabe had declined to vote an indictment,\u201d according to an email from McCabe\u2019s legal team obtained by Fox News.\n\nIf McCabe\u2019s involvement is as extensive as some are suggesting, I have complete confidence that he\u2019ll soon face charges far more serious than merely lying about his leaks.\n\nThe likely prosecution of McCabe is an important step in the necessary effort to hold senior Obama-era officials at the FBI and elsewhere accountable for abusing the power and credibility of the U.S. government in an attempt to reverse the American people\u2019s choice of Donald Trump to become president of the United States.\n\nLast month, I reassured Fox News readers that Attorney General William Barr\u2019s decision not to pursue criminal charges against Comey was not \u201ca vindication of Comey, a defeat for the president, or an end to the inquiry surrounding these leaks.\u201d\n\nThe likely impending indictment of McCabe proves that I was right to trust Barr\u2019s judgment. The restraint Barr showed in his handling of Comey\u2019s own leaks adds to the legitimacy of the case against McCabe, which seems about to become the first prosecution in the \u201cinvestigation of the investigators.\u201d\n\nThis shows that President Trump\u2019s Justice Department and Attorney General Barr are focused solely on the restoration of public trust, and that they\u2019re totally committed to the integrity of the process as they seek to remove the stain left by the out-of-control Obama-era FBI leadership.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWe now know this investigation has teeth. All that remains to be seen is how far it all goes. A wider and wider swath of misconduct during the Comey-McCabe era is coming under scrutiny, as the motion alleging that the government withheld evidence in the case against former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn shows.\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court documents \u2013 at least some of which reportedly carry McCabe\u2019s signature \u2014 may finally be approaching declassification as well.\n\nThe ultimate question will be just how much evidence emerges linking McCabe to a conspiracy to trump up charges against Flynn and inflate the Russiagate hoax in an effort to sabotage President Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf McCabe\u2019s involvement is as extensive as some are suggesting, I have complete confidence that he\u2019ll soon face charges far more serious than merely lying about his leaks.\n\nThe decision to prosecute McCabe is the strongest indication yet that the Justice Department is on the trail of some truly nefarious behavior by some extremely high-ranking government officials. The only question now is how deep and broad this genuine conspiracy goes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JOSEPH DIGENOVA", "description": "It\u2019s clear that the Justice Department is right to seek criminal charges against fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe in light of the leaking and lying that cost him his job last year.", "authors": ["Joseph Digenova", "Joseph Digenova Was Us Attorney For The District Of Columbia", "An Independent Counsel."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/13/694940094001_6086043814001_6086038286001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
