That can be the back-and-forth sniping on Team Fortress\u2019 2_fort, or the dual bases of Halo\u2019s Blood Gulch. For Battlefield, it\u2019s Metro. The tight, claustrophobic map has appeared under various names in multiple games in the series, and was just added to Battlefield V in the form of \u201cOperation Underground.\u201d Anyone looking for a reason to boot it up again should immediately jump into a match on this fantastic, frantic warzone.\n\nMetro first appeared as \u201cOperation M\u00e9tro\u201d in 2011\u2019s Battlefield 3. It was one of the first maps available to the public during online tests and quickly became a staple of multiplayer. \u201cMetro Only\u201d servers were common, offering a 24-7 dose of close-quarters combat.\n\nUnlike many other maps, Operation M\u00e9tro was confined. Battles took place in crowded underground subway tunnels, leading to matches that were absolute bloodbaths. Its popularity persisted and earned the map a spot in Battlefield 4's downloadable content. When Battlefield V released, changing the setting back to World War II, it seemed like there wouldn\u2019t be another incarnation. That\u2019s changed with the release of Operation Underground, a revamped version of Metro with a vintage setting.\n\nBattlefield V\u2019s maps generally tend to capture the large scale the series is known for, such as the desert map of Hamada or sunny field of Arras. While there have been game modes that feel more like Metro, adding chokepoints and extra defences, it\u2019s never been quite the same.\n\n\u201cOperation Underground\u201d moves the battle from France to Germany, adding a few new side tunnels for flanking and more areas above ground. The original Metro maps were prone to endless battles in the middle of hallways or the base of stairs. That still happens in Operation Underground, but these additional pathways give players the chance to slink around and turn the tide.\n\nEven though the original Operation M\u00e9tro was popular, it was also somewhat controversial. Many fans of Battlefield\u2019s large spaces and vehicle-focused combat hated the map for its meat-grinder gameplay and constant stalemates.\n\nOperation Underground seems destined for a similar split. In a few of the matches I\u2019ve played, I\u2019ve watched teams get utterly steamrolled. No matter how hard they\u2019ve pushed or tried to flank, it ended in disaster.\n\nSome players will hate this. If you\u2019re looking to drive a tank or have some cool sniper shots, this is not the map for you. It is the realm of one-hit kills from shotguns, grenades that take out whole squads, and tunnels brimming with machine gun fire. You will die playing Operation Underground, again and again. Sometimes, it will feel like horseshit.\n\nDid you really turn that corner and get cut to ribbons by two stationary gunners? Did that jerk just sprint through the smoke and waste you with a shotgun blast? Yes, and it\u2019s going to happen a lot. But that is part of the Metro maps\u2019 appeal. They are places where you are constantly fighting, never waiting for enemies, and spawning into hellacious battles. You either love it or hate it.\n\nI love it. Operation Underground helps round out Battlefield V\u2019s map rotation, which has had some issues compared to previous games. While rotating rewards from the \u201cTides of War\u201d encourage players to hop in and complete challenges, the original selection of maps was sorely lacking.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many of them, and only a few were particularly exciting. As Battlefield V has expanded, there have been disappointing tank battle maps and the occasional fast-paced beach assault. There\u2019s no replacing the classics, though, and Operation Underground brings some tried-and-true spice to a sometimes underwhelming multiplayer experience.", "description": "If a multiplayer shooter goes on long enough, it\u2019ll develop a signature map.
