support in place to help them turn their life around, according to inspectors.\n\nThe probation and prison watchdogs reviewed the support boys aged 12 to 17 received from services in their first three months after release.\n\nThey followed 50 who had all committed serious crimes or were repeat offenders and had been sentenced to detention and training orders, which meant they served half their time in custody and half in the community.\n\nThey all served time in the five young offender institutions (YOI) across England and Wales \u2013 Parc in Wales, Cookham Wood in Kent, Feltham in London, Werrington in Staffordshire and Wetherby in West Yorkshire.\n\nIn the three months after release, half of the group had been investigated by police, 10 had been convicted of more crimes and six of the group had gone missing.\n\nThose who had reformed were \u201cthe exception rather than the rule\u201d, inspectors said.\n\nA young inmate looks out of the window of a cell at Feltham YOI (PA)\n\nRichard Garside, the director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, called for the number of children sent to prison to be reduced, adding: \u201cOn just about every measure \u2013 housing, education and training, physical and mental health, drug and alcohol services, social services \u2013 the state is failing children and young people leaving prison.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, many of them get into further trouble with the law and go back to prison.\u201d\n\nChief inspector of probation Justin Russell, who took on the role in June, said the results of the review painted a \u201cgrim picture\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is certainly the most disturbing report I\u2019ve read since starting in my new role.\u201d\n\nNearly 80% of children and young people in custody have carried out violent crimes, robbery, burglary or sexual offences.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the monthly number of people in youth custody was 894, with the average sentence being just over 16 months \u2013 while around 550 are released every year.\n\nMr Russell said: \u201cWe were very disappointed to see how little progress there had been.\n\n\u201cIf the right services are not in place, these often-vulnerable people are being set up to fail.\n\n\u201cThere are specific programmes to help individuals prepare for release, but none of the people in our sample attended one.\u201d\n\nMr Russell said it was \u201cimmensely disappointing\u201d to find problems from 2015 remain and it was no surprise one of the offenders told inspectors he felt \u201clike a parcel\u201d.\n\nHe said a \u201cmajor reason\u201d for the problems was \u201cpoor support services\u201d with planning meetings taking place too late so adequate services were not put in place before release, adding: \u201cWe found that the period in custody was focused very much on behaviour management and on work in custody, it wasn\u2019t really preparing people properly for release.\u201d\n\nThere were still young people who days before release still did not have accommodation arranged, he said, which hindered efforts to set them up in education or register them for health services.\n\nChildren\u2019s social services were \u201cfalling down\u201d on their responsibility of sorting accommodation \u2013 but youth offending teams were \u201cquite passive\u201d and not \u201cadvocating\u201d for the young people either, he said.\n\nThere was a \u201cmad scramble immediately before release to try and find somewhere to put these young people\u201d because councils were \u201creluctant\u201d at a time of austerity to keep paying for their care home place while they were in custody, but described this as a \u201cfalse economy\u201d.\n\nHe called on the Government to come up with a \u201cnational accommodation strategy\u201d for young people coming out of care.\n\nChief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said: \u201cIn some cases, planning started just 10 days prior to release or even after release \u2013 this is too little, too late to be effective.\n\n\u201cA lot of the activity that we saw in custody focused on containing children and young people, managing their behaviour or simply trying to fill their time.\u201d\n\nWithin the first three months of release, out of the 50 young offenders followed by inspectors:\n\n\u2013 Some 37 needed help from children\u2019s social care services, but only six of these received help.\n\n\u2013 There were seven put in supported accommodation \u2013 usually for 16 to 17-year-olds and a bedsit style arrange with visits from a support worker \u2013 which Mr Russell described as an \u201cunregulated sector of care accommodation\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Just 44% were given the support they need for drug problems, while only 11 went into education or training immediately after release.\n\n\u2013 There were 29 who had been in local authority care or had been in the past. Just one returned to the same accommodation they had before custody.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \u201cStrong resettlement support both inside and outside prison is a vital pillar of rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cWe must improve standards so they are consistent and enable young offenders to move away from crime for good.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are reviewing resettlement services at all young offenders institutions and are working closely with external agencies which provide accommodation, education, training and employment to improve support on release.\u201d", "description": "Those who had reformed were `the exception rather than the rule\u00b4, inspectors said.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/00/wire-19418030-1570489452-300_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
