With the contract set to expire at midnight Saturday, experts say the risk of a strike at GM is rising. It would be the first walkout at the automaker in a dozen years.\n\n\u201cNobody wins with a strike,\u201d Rebecca Lindland, auto analyst and founder of RebeccaDrives.com, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cGM is saying we\u2019re facing competitive pressures. They have actually found a lot of jobs for workers in those plants that are scheduled to close. So they feel like they\u2019ve done a lot for the union and the union is saying, but we want more,\u201d Lindland said.\n\nGM has announced plans to close four factories in Ohio, Michigan and Maryland. The union has pledged to fight the closures.\n\nUnion workers are also seeking higher wages and new products to be made at three underutilized GM plants in Michigan and Kansas.\n\nAccording to GM, its average hourly employee earns about $90,000 per year before benefits. That\u2019s higher than the real median U.S. household income of $61,372, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nLindland says any union deal with GM will set the pattern for Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).\n\nSigns of a strike\n\nIn a big sign that a strike at GM may be on the horizon, the UAW is considering ordering janitorial workers to walk off the job this weekend. The union\u2019s contract with the janitorial services provider, Aramark (ARMK), expires at the very same time its agreement expires with Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers.\n\nAramark World Headquarters, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, photo More\n\nAramark handles janitorial services for five GM plants. If they strike, GM workers may refuse to cross the picket lines to go to work, and that could pressure GM to make a deal.\n\nContentious talks\n\nDetroit\u2019s Big Three have seen a torrid sales pace begin to slow down as they contend with rising competition from Silicon Valley and global uncertainties, including the ongoing U.S. trade fight with China.\n\nLindland said part of the reason why talks are so contentious this time around is because a lot of disruption has happened in the auto industry since the last contract negotiations took place in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe have all new players. We have players like Rivian, players like Waymo coming in with autonomous vehicles,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s causing a lot of contention in terms of what GM is looking for.\u201d\n\nUAW scandal\n\nTalks have also been marred by a widening federal investigation implicating the UAW\u2019s top executives, including its president Gary Jones, in a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme. Lindland said the scandal has caused a growing division between union officials and its rank and file.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Gary Jones, center, whose home was searched by FBI agents Wednesday as part of a corruption probe, walks with UAW members during the first part of the annual Labor Day parade in downtown Detroit on Monday, Sept. 2, 2019.
