Nevertheless, the majority of the masses is still trying to stay away from such a way of gaining digital assets.\n\nOne reason is that some notorious game developers are not particularly honest with players, and are trying to make a quick profit through gambling tricks and speculation. Another point is that a lot of games incorporate, to a large extent, the features associated with a new decentralized economy, thereby lacking an appealing design and captivating gameplay experience. Moreover, many people are still not very aware of blockchain technology and its true potential.\n\nGalaxyOne Tech says it intends to elaborate on all of the issues mentioned above. As opposed to many straight-up-luck crypto games with static designs, the company promises to deliver something significantly different. With its main product, the blockchain mobile game CryptoGalaxy, GalaxyOne Tech offers its users not only the opportunity to collect digital assets, but also to apply their skills while exploring the vast universe.\n\nSetting off on a space mission\n\nThe storyline behind the game spans over 175 years and permeates five consecutive versions of CryptoGalaxy: Genesis, Origin, Tech, War and Revelation.

In a bid to search for sustainable sources of energy on other planets, world leaders decided to launch a space exploration expedition. With the passage of time, one spaceship suddenly stumbled upon an unknown galaxy.\n\nAs it turned out the newly discovered galaxy was composed of 4,100 master planets and numerous minor planets. Some of the planets appeared to be resource-rich, as they possessed some unknown minerals that could be converted into energy. Therefore, dozens of spaceships were sent from Earth to mine the resources hidden inside these planets.\n\nIn the currently available CryptoGalaxy 2.0 Origin, players are able to explore the unknown planets, dig for minerals and become genesis planet owners. As mineral mining requires specific skills, CryptoGalaxy 2.0 provides players with a know-how guide that teaches them how to collect the valuable resources.\n\nDownload the game here\n\nThe revenue from mineral mining can be converted into tokens suitable for trading in secondary markets.

In total, its supply in the game equals 21 million and its value is backed by a strategic investment fund.\n\nCryptoGalaxy 3.0 Tech is scheduled for a public release in the first quarter of 2020. It will feature an encounter with an alien civilization, commercial trade and technological empowerment. The gaming process becomes more thrilling with the discoveries of an inhabited planet as well as the emergence of new mining bots and recorders with encrypted content.
