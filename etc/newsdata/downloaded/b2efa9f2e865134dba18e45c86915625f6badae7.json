(Plant Lettuce Tomato) burger uses a Beyond Meat burger, served on a sesame seed bun with tomato, lettuce, pickles, onions, mayo-style sauce, ketchup, mustard and a slice of processed cheddar cheese.\n\nBut, before vegans and vegetarians get too excited, technically it isn\u2019t suitable for either because of the way it\u2019s cooked.\n\nREAD MORE: Adding a lemon to your drink might not be vegan and people are confused\n\nWhile Beyond Meat burgers are vegan, the additional toppings on the PLT mean they aren\u2019t vegan as cheese contains dairy and mayonnaise contains eggs.\n\nThe fast food chain says the new burger can be customised, but there\u2019s another issue in that the burgers are cooked on the same grill as other meat-based products so technically they can\u2019t be classed as vegetarian.\n\nThe P.L.T. patty is made with a Beyond Meat, plant-based patty that has been crafted exclusively by McDonald\u2019s, for McDonald\u2019s.

The #plantbased revolution is upon us. \u2014 John Oberg (@JohnOberg) September 26, 2019\n\nA decisive step towards addressing McDonald\u2019s own carbon footprint as a responsible worldwide company!\ud83d\udc4d \u2014 Ram Bhat (@leogsb) September 26, 2019\n\nTake a bow!\n\nThank you for offering more environmentally friendly and cruelty free options! pic.twitter.com/fQRyVS42Dc \u2014 J \ud83c\udf39 (@jadeo09) September 26, 2019\n\nBut others weren\u2019t quite so enthralled with the addition to the fast-food chain\u2019s menu.\n\n\u201cThere is no way I\u2019m eating a patty with leaves,\u201d tweeted one dubious McDonalds follower.\n\nMmm that sounds really g.. pic.twitter.com/pxzaQsDavH \u2014 Kus (@kusqt) September 26, 2019\n\nIll pass. That sounds fricken disgusting. I'm all for saving the environment but there is no way I'm eating a patty with leaves.

During this test we\u2019ll continue to listen to our guests to understand their tastes.\u201d\n\nNot coming to the UK anytime soon\n\nWhile there is still no news of a plant-based burger coming to McDonalds UK, earlier this year more than 160,000 people signed a petition encouraging the fast food chain to launch a vegan burger.\n\nIt was originally launched to petition McDonald\u2019s to add a meat-free burger to the menu.\n\nREAD MORE: Vegans have twice as many sick days as meat-eaters\n\nBut thousands then got involved saying that it should in fact be a vegan burger as many of the vegetarian options currently available worldwide include dairy.\n\nThe petition was started as a response to Burger King launching its meat-free Impossible Burger at select restaurants in Missouri, USA and in the UK KFC trialled the vegan Imposter burger this summer.\n\nThe growing demand for vegan food has never been more evident in the UK.\n\nMcDonalds joins the growing number of fast food retailers creating meat-free alternatives for their customers.\n\nREAD MORE: Should veganism be considered a religion?\n\nThis includes Greggs\u2019 vegan sausage roll and the McDonald\u2019s vegetarian Happy Meal and vegan McNuggets.\n\nFast food chains including Subway and Pizza Hut have also launched vegetarian and vegan alternatives.\n\nThe increase in plant-based options is also tapping into a wider, global interest in veganism. In the UK alone, 7% of the national population identify as vegan.", "description": "The plant-based burger will be available in 28 restaurants in Canada.", "authors": ["Marie Claire Dorking"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/weZsSehxG1Y91ipqlNsOHA--~B/aD01NjU7dz03ODY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/4c4f6060-e104-11e9-bd9b-9d813af831b0", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
