Photo: Courtesy NBC\n\nAnyone who\u2019s set foot in a hospital or doctor\u2019s office or watched television shows set in one knows nurses spend nearly all of their waking hours devoted to caring for others, so the key to a meaningful nurse gift is one that encourages them to care for themselves. Whether it\u2019s something that\u2019ll make her long shifts more bearable or help him relax when he\u2019s off the clock, you\u2019ll want to get the special nurse in your life a gift that acknowledges all of the hard work they do. Since no one knows the demands of the job better than nurses themselves, we asked five experienced nurses about the best gifts they\u2019ve received and the ones they\u2019d love to get. Their picks, below, include everything from a guidebook for new nurses to a \u201cstatus\u201d stethoscope.\n\nStylish compression socks\n\nTherafirm Core-Spun 20-30mmHg Moderate Graduated Compression Support Trendsetter Knee High Socks Nearly every nurse we spoke with said they\u2019d love to receive a pair of compression socks, preferably in a fun pattern or print. According to Sonja M. Schwartzbach, a nurse in the tristate area, these snug socks are the \u201choly grail\u201d for nurses on their feet for 12-hour shifts. Atlanta-based family nurse practitioner Julia Eze says they\u2019re \u201creally good for making sure you\u2019re getting good blood supply to your legs,\u201d which prevents pain and swelling, and Katie Duke, an in-patient cardiology nurse practitioner in New York City, recommends Therafirm socks that \u201coffer medical grade compression, which means [they\u2019re] going to help keep your feet and legs from getting fatigued.\u201d $46 at Amazon Buy $46 at Amazon Buy\n\nNurse Mates Women's 12-14 Mmhg Compression Trouser Sock Lilac Aqua Tie Dye Here\u2019s a very on-trend tie-dye pair from Nurse Mates, one of Schwartzbach\u2019s favorite brands, that are less than $20. As Schwartzbach says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to spend a ton of money on [a pair] but it\u2019s something that when nurses get as a gift, they appreciate.\u201d $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nScrubs and accessories\n\nBecause nurses wear them every day, a new set of scrubs would be a nice gift. Duke (who actually designed her own line of scrubs with Cherokee Uniforms) explains that lots of nurses often wear free scrubs offered by their hospitals, but that these can be unflattering, uncomfortable, or not made with enough pockets for everything nurses need to carry around. \u201cWe work in health care, so you can\u2019t really express yourself with tons of fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cBut everybody still wants to look good and be confident in what they\u2019re wearing at the hospital.\u201d This set from Figs has a more tailored fit and plenty of pockets. Nurse practitioner Danielle LeVeck (who is a Figs brand ambassador) says, \u201cThey are the most innovative and downright beautiful scrubs.\u201d Registered nurse Brittney Wilson agrees that \u201cthey\u2019re super-soft and really nice.\u201d\n\nFigs also makes tailored, functional scrubs for men.\n\nJaanuu Seamless Underscrub Like Figs, Jaanuu is a relatively new brand that designs stylish scrubs, as well as pieces like jackets and undershirts meant to be worn under or over your hospital outfit. Wilson says the brand has done a good job catering to the plus-size audience, and it\u2019s also a favorite of Schwartzbach, who turns to Jaanuu for \u201cscrub leisure\u201d styles like this underscrub shirt. Since some parts of the hospital are kept very cold, she relies on these for warmth \u2014 and also modesty. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of bending and lifting,\u201d she says, \u201cand you don\u2019t want that crack between your scrub top and your scrub pants to show.\u201d A tucked-in underscrub shirt closes up the gap. $48 at Jaanuu Buy\n\nNurse Badge Reel Since many hospitals require that nurses wear specific color scrubs, a little piece of flair like a handmade badge-holder clip helps them add some personality to their uniform. Eze says nurses often choose clips that represent their specialties like a heart for a cardiac nurse or an X-ray for a nurse in the orthopedic department. From $10 at Etsy Buy\n\nCabepow Silicone Wedding Rings, 4-Pack For newly engaged or married nurses who don\u2019t want to risk losing their rings, silicone bands offer a cheap and fuss-free alternative to wear on the job. \u201cI have a beautiful wedding ring and engagement ring and I don\u2019t wear them to the hospital because it\u2019s an infection risk,\u201d says Schwartzbach. She\u2019s heard \u201chorror stories\u201d of nurses throwing away rubber gloves with their rings still in them. Plus, the silicone ones are easy to sanitize. From $8 at Amazon Buy From $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nA status stethoscope\n\nLittmann Classic III Monitoring Stethoscope $78 (was $90, now 13% off) With three nurses mentioning the brand by name, Littmann is basically a status stethoscope among nurses. \u201cWhen you see doctors and cardiologists wearing a stethoscope, it\u2019s usually that one,\u201d says Schwartzbach, who thinks it\u2019d be an especially thoughtful gift for a new nurse about to start his or her career. LeVeck adds that they\u2019re \u201cthe highest-quality stethoscopes on the market and a must-have for any nurse.\u201d Wilson says \u201cyou can almost never go wrong\u201d with a Littmann. $78 at Amazon Buy $78 at Amazon Buy\n\nA nursing bible\n\nBecoming Nursey: From Code Blues to Code Browns, How to Care for Your Patients and Yourself by Kati Kleber Another solid pick for new nurses or recent nursing-school graduates is this practical guide to everything from time management to performing patient assessments. Schwartzbach says it covers most things nurses usually \u201clearn on the job,\u201d and Duke likes that it includes all \u201cthe best things you need to know for your first year.\u201d $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nThings to stay caffeinated\n\nYeti Rambler 30 oz Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler For staying caffeinated or keeping hydrated, Eze says an insulated tumbler is \u201cperfect work accessory [that] a nurse can utilize throughout the entirety of the shift.\u201d Schwartzbach says Yeti tumblers, which keep coffee hot and water cold, are popular among nurses because they hold large quantities of liquid to sip during a shift. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nStarbucks Digital Gift Card Speaking of coffee, several nurses we spoke with said a gift card for Starbucks (or local coffee shop) would be a very welcome gift for nurses who rely on caffeine to stay awake and alert for long hours on their feet. \u201c[Nurses] can use that going into their shift, but they can also treat their whole unit to Starbucks,\u201d says Duke, and Eze calls it \u201can all-time fave.\u201d From $25 at Amazon Buy From $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nSelf-care stuff\n\nZeel Gift Card Not surprisingly, massage gift cards came up a few times when we chatted with nurses. \u201cNurses always take care of other people,\u201d says Duke. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do for 40-plus hours a week and sometimes at the end of the day we don\u2019t have energy to do things for ourselves.\u201d LeVeck agrees that \u201cnurses often care for everyone except themselves,\u201d and that they\u2019d appreciate a gift that lets them pamper themselves. A gift card for a local spa is always good, but Schwartzbach says one of her favorite gifts was an in-home massage through the on-demand service Zeel: \u201cThey send a masseuse and a table to your house \u2014 it was amazing!\u201d $50 at Amazon Buy $50 at Amazon Buy\n\nPlated Meal Kits $36 (was $48, now 25% off) One of the best gifts LeVeck ever received was a subscription to a meal-delivery service. \u201cNursing is exhausting and the last thing any of us wants to do when we get home is cook dinner,\u201d she says. She loved that it took the work out of grocery shopping and menu planning so she could easily prepare healthy meals for her family.
