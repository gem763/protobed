He cited 'marginal loss factors' in the grid and the need for more pump storage and gas peakers.\n\n\"The regulatory market doesn\u2019t provide for straightforward business case\" for these projects, he said, which has led the CEFC with the government's balance sheet to back projects.\n\nBut more consideration was needed on the supply of grant funding and to whether CEFC might write derivative contracts, he said.\n\nFinanciers on Thursday also pointed to the timing mismatch in price purchase agreements, which are typically written for 10 years on projects with a notional life as long as 20 years. This means debt and equity investors are taking a big risk for back half of the life of wind and solar projects.\n\nMr Orton said margin loss and connection issues would \"impact on the view of equity investors, and that\u2019s a reason the sector might slow for a period of time\".", "description": "The Investor Group on Climate Change has called for a \"narrowing of the spectrum of uncertainty\" in energy investment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2555%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_152%2C$y_17/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/82072f5a38d10c7febd9a1eb8bb4352256cb8242", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
