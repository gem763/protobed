Not as happy as they can be because there is still a game to go as we've said.\"\n\nMeanwhile Jones paid tribute to Willi Heinz after the back-up scrumhalf saw his dreams of playing in a World Cup final crushed by a tournament-ending hamstring injury suffered against New Zealand.\n\nJones picked just two specialist scrumhalves in his 31-man squad for Japan.\n\nBen Spencer arrived in Tokyo on Monday as cover for first-choice No 9 Ben Youngs, with the Saracens scrumhalf now having just a few days to prepare for a World Cup final.\n\n\"It's tough for Willi, he's a very well-liked member of the squad and he was in tears in the dressing room,\" said Jones.\n\n\"But he's collected himself, he now knows he's got another role to play for us.\"\n\nJones added: \"The great thing is Willi wanted to stay and we wanted him to stay so it wasn't a hard discussion.\n\n\"It's like when you want to get married mate. If the lady wants to marry you and you offer to marry, it's a pretty easy conversation.\n\n\"He works hard for the team, Ben (Youngs) and him have got a really good relationship and even now he's already started to mentor Ben Spencer. He's a really great team man.\"\n\nSpencer's three replacement caps amount to just over 20 minutes of Test rugby in total but Jones said: \"Ben has been in and around the squad consistently for the last couple of years so he knows the game, he knows the players.\n\n\"We always said to those guys outside the 31 that they need to be ready, and he is ready to go.\"", "description": "Eddie Jones has responded in sharp fashion after Wales coach Warren Gatland questioned whether England had played their final a week early.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2552/3feddb8b03314e7a93e1932dff031904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
