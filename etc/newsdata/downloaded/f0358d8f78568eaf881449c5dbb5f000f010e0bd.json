What else are they supposed to do when faced with such apathy and contradiction from those who are in charge? Speaking truth to power has always been controversial, but it is also essential to the proper functioning of democracy.\n\nIsn\u2019t the Prime Minister proud of his determination to put coal jobs ahead of the survival of Pacific Island nations?\n\nWhich brings me back to Greta Thunberg. Given the determination of the Australian government to ignore the scientific, economic and diplomatic evidence that digging up and burning more coal is harmful, why do Australian conservatives get so upset about being accused of apathy and inaction? Isn\u2019t the Prime Minister proud of his determination to put coal jobs ahead of the survival of Pacific Island nations? Isn\u2019t the Coalition proud of its decision to scrap Julia Gillard\u2019s carbon price?\n\nMorrison prides himself on his slogans and simple messages so you\u2019d think he, and the conservative commentariat, would have welcomed Thunberg\u2019s speech as an opportunity to clarify whose side they are on. Thunberg accused leaders like Morrison of putting the economy ahead of the environment, of ignoring science-based emissions reduction targets and preferring a \"business as usual\" approach to climate action.\n\nIsn\u2019t Morrison proud to be guilty as charged? Wasn\u2019t he just re-elected on a promise to do the bare minimum?\n\nDemocracy is about choices and our Prime Minister has made it clear to Australian voters, and Pacific leaders, that coal output is more important to him than climate action. He might be happy to run water bottles around a Fiji footy oval but he flat-out refuses to take Fiji\u2019s concerns about rising sea waters seriously.\n\nWhen Morrison signalled his conservative virtues by waving a lump of coal around in Parliament, he was trying to upset people like Greta Thunberg and Frank Bainimarama. And it worked. So why is he now surprised that so many people are disappointed in, and even scared by, his priorities?\n\nSince the Coalition won office in 2013, Australia\u2019s domestic emissions have risen, our fossil fuel exports have risen, and hundreds of thousands of hectares of land have been cleared. We aren\u2019t tackling climate change, we are accelerating it. The world\u2019s scientists say that is something to worry about, but our Prime Minister disagrees.\n\nIf Morrison is proud of his actions, he has nothing to fear from Greta Thunberg, Extinction Rebellion or our Pacific Island neighbours. Tony Abbott once admitted that he was \"a bit of a weather vane\" on climate policy. Only time will tell if Morrison will stick to his guns, but I\u2019m betting the climate scientists will stick to theirs.", "description": "This government has chosen to drag its heels on climate issues.
