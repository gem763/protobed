But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. So I\u2019m thrilled with what he said.\u201d\n\nPopovich is one of the NBA\u2019s most outspoken coaches, never shy to offer opinion on political matters - he is a staunch opponent of President Donald Trump - or social causes. Many NBA coaches have remained largely mum on the current situation with China. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni refused to answer questions on the topic after his team\u2019s game in Tokyo on Tuesday, Golden State coach Steve Kerr said he wanted to educate himself on the situation before speaking out, and Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers didn\u2019t go too deeply into specifics when asked his opinion.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what this country is about: freedom of speech,\u201d Rivers told reporters at Clippers practice Tuesday. \u201cAnd we should always have freedom of speech. But \u2026 freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences.\u201d\n\nOther coaches have said they are simply too busy getting ready for the season to fully dive into the topic.\n\n\u201cTraining camp\u2019s a pretty immersive time for us to get into game film and training, etc.,\u201d Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cI have a lot of faith in the leadership of the NBA that they know what they\u2019re doing to take care of these matters.\u201d\n\nBut Popovich spoke at length about Silver\u2019s remarks. He compared their significance to two other moments that he finds significant from Silver\u2019s career - how the NBA banned former Clippers owner Donald Sterling over racist comments, and how the league has been a leader in supporting the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cAdam is a very progressive leader,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe all remember how he handled the situation with the former owner of the Clippers, which made everybody proud because it was the right thing to do. A couple years ago - I can\u2019t remember, time goes by quickly, two, three, four years ago - I was walking the streets of New York City during the Gay Pride parade and I turned around and here comes a float and Adam\u2019s standing on the float with a big sign in support of LGBTQ and I felt great again, just like I did with the Clipper deal.\n\n\u201cAnd then we come out strongly for freedom of speech. I felt great again.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gregg Popovich, the NBA's longest-tenured coach, lauded NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Tuesday for his stance supporting freedom of speech amid the ongoing rift with China.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/spurs_media_day_basketball_36730_c0-183-4392-2743_s1770x1032.jpg?60bb3da831a170f14d7b1f91370056109a6527a3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
