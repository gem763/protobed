Also, anyone missing a wheel?\u201d\n\nAbout 600,000 to 800,000 metric tons of fishing gear are abandoned or lost at sea each year. Another 8m metric tons of plastic waste flows in from beaches.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Crew members sort through plastic on board a support vessel on the Pacific Ocean.

Photograph: AP\n\nDuring a previous pilot of four months at sea, the boom broke apart and no plastic was collected. Since then, changes have been made to the design of the system, with the addition of a \u2018parachute anchor\u2019 to slow down the device\u2019s movement in the ocean.\n\nThe latest pilot began in June. The project was started in 2013, and its design has undergone several major revisions. It is hoped that the final design will be able to clean up half of the debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.", "description": "Huge floating boom finally retains debris from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, creator says", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee18e6b7288f7419c5db09ac3fb9aa961c93c1ac/0_97_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7086b4a0df8a5a7cfe4fb459922964b9"}
