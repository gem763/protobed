But analysts say its impact on voters is still unclear.\n\nAround 1,000 people demonstrated against Fidesz in Gyor late Saturday, with opposition politicians from different parties urging the crowd to vote out the mayor.\n\nObservers see the elections as a litmus test for the opposition\u2019s new strategy of cooperation, which could offer a way to challenge Orban in the next general election in 2022.\n\nThe opposition is expected to make gains Sunday from its 2014 results and possibly win the Budapest mayoralty. But it needs to do well in the countryside to stand a chance in 2022, says Andras Biro-Nagy of the Policy Solutions think-tank.\n\n\u201cBudapest has symbolic value of course, but it is equally important to win provincial cities and build roots and infrastructure there, that is where 2022 will be won or lost,\u201d he told AFP.", "description": "Budapest (AFP) \u2013 Hungarians go to the polls Sunday in municipal elections seen as a rare chance for the beleaguered opposition to roll back the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/daad61_campaign-billboard-city-mayor-istvan-tarlos-in-budapest-municipal-elections-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
