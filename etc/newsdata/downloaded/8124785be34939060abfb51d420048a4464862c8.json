Prices start at 799 euros ($880).\n\nHuawei is using its own, stripped-down version of Android, whose basic code is provided free of charge by Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.49% GOOG, +0.51%\n\nThe Chinese company\u2019s phones are popular in Europe and Asia. but little known in the U.S., where its telecom switching gear has been effectively blocked for years over fears it could be used for spying by China\u2019s communist rulers.\n\nThe Mate 30 will go on sale next week in China but won\u2019t hit European stores until next month as the company gathers consumer feedback, said Yu.\n\nHe said the company hadn\u2019t expected the trade dispute to last so long when it was planning the launch.\n\n\u201cThis U.S.-China trade war delayed us and is still not stopping, so we\u2019ve become the bargaining chip between two great nations,\u201d Yu said.\n\nLosing access to Google\u2019s mobile apps will make it harder for Huawei to battle Samsung 005930, +0.61% for top spot in the mobile phone market, because it will be less attractive to wireless carriers, said Jean Baptiste Su, principal analyst at Atherton Research.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think operators will risk having millions of disappointed customers that rely on Google services (who) see it doesn\u2019t work on their brand new devices,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a bid to reduce reliance on Google, Yu said Huawei is spending $1 billion encouraging global developers to make apps compatible with its own app gallery, which is mainly used in China. It will take a 15% commission, compared with 30% rivals such as Apple AAPL, -0.81% charge, he said.", "description": "Huawei launched a new flagship smartphone on Thursday but it comes without popular Google apps such as Chrome or YouTube after U.S. sanctions kicked in,...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR685_huawei_ZG_20190919162912.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
