The ensuing legal battle could strip away one of the most important things for women who want to speak out about abuse: anonymity.\n\nLast month, the Indian Supreme Court ordered Facebook, which owns Instagram, to reveal identifying details behind the person running the @HerdSceneAnd account. The account had published anonymous stories accusing influential sculptor and painter Subodh Gupta of sexual misconduct amid India\u2019s reckoning with the Me Too movement.\n\n\u201cAnonymity can be a powerful tool in protecting free speech,\u201d said HuffPost India technology editor Gopal Sathe, who reported on the contentious case with audience and engagement editor Nehmat Kaur.\n\nThe case is addressing many complicated issues, including data privacy, survivor advocacy and government intervention in tech.\n\nPeople around the world are watching the case closely to see how Facebook will respond. The U.S., U.K., Australia and other governments have been pressuring the company to make it easier for law enforcement to identify its users, and now this case against a group of daring Indian women might just make that possible.\n\n\u201cAlthough companies like Facebook and Twitter often position themselves as enabling social movements, what we know is that the big tech companies are all harvesting and analyzing the most minute details about each of us, and this puts us all at risk the moment they decide that complying with a government order to invade privacy makes good business sense,\u201d Gopal said.\n\nWithout a guarantee of anonymity, abuse survivors who want to warn other people about a perpetrator\u2019s behavior may be less likely to speak out.\n\n\u201cIn India, thousands of women implicitly trusted Facebook, Instagram and Twitter with their stories of harassment and assault,\u201d Nehmat said. \u201cNow they\u2019re in a position where they\u2019re relying on a profit-seeking, technically amoral corporation to act in ideological and ethical ways to protect their identities.\u201d\n\nThe ruling has left many young women, including students and new professionals who may have little social or economic capital, in a vulnerable position, Nehmat said.\n\nStay with us as we follow the next hearing set for November to see how Facebook handles the request to reveal who is behind @HerdSceneAnd.\n\n\u201cWhat happens then is going to basically shape how women use social media for sexual harassment and assault accusations going forward,\u201d Nehmat explained.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you think social media platforms should be responsible for protecting the identities of possible abuse victims? Let us know.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nAurora\n\nRead more from Gopal here.

Jyapu Day marks the end of the harvest season.\n\nGerman feminist and philosopher Heide Goettner-Abendroth has traveled the world for over three decades to study matriarchies and learn what makes them different from male-dominated societies of the West. Rather than being just an inverted image of patriarchy, she says they are fundamentally about equality. In an interview with HuffPost France, she talks about her visit to indigenous communities in Mexico, her time in Indonesia, and her thoughts on how people from all backgrounds can draw inspiration from societies where respecting women is not optional.\n\nEvan Agostini/Invision/AP \"Joker\" actor Zazie Beetz at the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 9.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips\u2019 latest film, a reimagining of the origin story of the \u201cBatman\u201d villain Joker, has sparked fierce discussion. The film, which stars Joaquin Phoenix as aspiring comic Arthur Fleck, has received both criticism and praise for its portrayal of mental illness. But HuffPost U.S. senior culture reporter Zeba Blay zeroes in on a different, less talked about theme in the movie: the ubiquitous presence of Black women as supporting characters. As Blay writes, \u201cThis is all worth thinking about, especially in a film that seems to be trying (but ultimately fails) to make some sort of commentary on the disparity between the haves and the have-nots.\u201d (Disclaimer: Her piece contains spoilers for \u201cJoker\u201d!)\n\nIn Case You Missed It...", "description": "Plus: What we can learn from matriarchal societies.", "authors": ["News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b3c212100009004ab8e0a.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
