Now we are here, it\u2019s time to perform, really.\u201d\n\nWales have only claimed one victory against Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history \u2013 and that was 32 years ago in a third-place play-off when they toppled the Wallabies.\n\nAnd their overall record under head coach Warren Gatland shows just seven wins from 41 attempts at the hands of the three southern hemisphere heavyweights.\n\nWales halted a 13-Test losing sequence at Australia\u2019s hands last November, with Tipuric set to be among several survivors from that 9-6 success who run out at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.\n\nAsked if there had been a mental block prior to that win, Tipuric added: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to say.\n\n\u201cThose games are so tight, there is maybe... people would expect there was a bit of a mental block, I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIn the end in the last game we probably left about 15 points out there, so it made the scoreline look a lot closer than it actually was.\u201d\n\nIf Wales are to triumph, then Tipuric\u2019s battle at the breakdown with Australia\u2019s revered back-row double act Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be crucial.\n\nThe 67 times-capped Tipuric has encountered both players on several previous occasions, and he knows exactly what is coming.\n\n\u201cThey are absolutely world-class sevens,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you play against world-class back-rowers you always know you are going to be in for a tough game.\n\n\u201cThose two are consistently up there with the best in the world. You know what type of game you are going to be in for.\n\n\u201cPocock is one of the best players in the world over the ball defensively \u2013 and Michael is more of an attacking seven and probably has a bit more of a rugby brain to be in the right place at the right time.\n\n\u201cYou would rather play the best players in the world and challenge yourself, rather than face a back-row that isn\u2019t as good. You want to play against the best, and you know against those two you will have to be on form.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that Sunday is so much a cup final, but it\u2019s an important game for us in this World Cup.\n\n\u201cMomentum is an important part of it. If you keep on building and putting in good performances, you are going to be flying and tough to beat.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Justin Tipuric says \u201cit is time to perform\u201d when Wales\u00a0face a World Cup\u00a0showdown against Australia\u00a0that could shape their destiny in the tournament.
