Right now, not very, even if the loosehead prop misses both of their Rugby World Cup pool games against Tonga and the United States.\n\nThat may sound like a strange statement to make regarding one of the most important players in the England squad, but it is a reflection of the unusual position that Eddie Jones\u2019 squad find themselves in. On Sunday they leave the United Kingdom to head for Japan to continue what is essentially another pre-season programme.\n\nFor the first time since taking the job, Jones has got his hands on the team for more than two months. The results are more than noticeable, with a leaner, fitter and more united squad putting together a very promising run of results ahead of the World Cup.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

England have never played two World Cup games inside four days, but while the new fixture schedule enforced by World Rugby that is supposed to bring the tier one and tier two nations an itinerary that reflects a more fair and balanced structure, it means that England have to prepare for their games with one eye on the 5 October clash against Argentina.\n\nThe immediate turnaround between the Tonga and USA games means that two different squads are almost certain to be used by Jones, with the Australian only set to deploy something close to his full-strength XV for the Pumas match nine days after the USA encounter. With that in mind, there is no need to risk Vunipola \u2013 or indeed Jack Nowell who remains sidelined from a long-term ankle injury yet remains in the World Cup picture \u2013 and it would be interesting to see whether they would both be unavailable had either Argentina or France been up first.\n\nWhat would be a real concern is if Vunipola doesn\u2019t make any of the pool games. While Jones ruled the Saracens prop out of the opening two fixtures, he didn\u2019t confirm that he will definitely be back for the latter two.\n\n\u201cMako definitely won\u2019t be ready, but we feel that he\u2019ll be right possibly for game three or game four of the pool stage,\u201d Jones said. \u201cJack Nowell the last couple of days has taken off so I\u2019ve had to hold him back a bit. He should be right similar to Mako, and then everyone else is in full training.\u201d\n\nIn Joe Marler and Ellis Genge, Jones has two very strong back-up options. But while both players look at home on the international stage, they would be the first to admit that they are not Mako Vunipola. The 28-year-old offers a handling game that rivals many of the backs in the England squad, a sturdy base in the scrum and a defensive work rate that embarrasses many a back-row forward, and the reality is that if England to win the World Cup for the first time in 16 years, they need Vunipola at his very best come the business end of the season. If that means wrapping him up in cotton wool to allow this troublesome hamstring to fully recover, then the attitude appears to be so be it.", "description": "How worried should England be about Mako Vunipola?
