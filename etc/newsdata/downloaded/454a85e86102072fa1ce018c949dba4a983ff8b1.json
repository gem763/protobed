Sabic took a 1.5 billion riyal impairment charge on its 25% holding in Swiss chemical manufacturer Clariant AG, it said in a statement.\n\nSaudi Arabia expects chemical makers like Sabic to form the basis for new industries in manufacturing and consumer goods and hopes they will provide jobs and reduce the economy\u2019s reliance on oil exports. State oil giant Saudi Aramco is buying Sabic to become one of the world\u2019s biggest refiners and chemical producers. Oil prices, which dropped about 9% in the quarter, are hindering Saudi growth and the government\u2019s ability to meet spending demands.\n\nSabic shares declined as much as 2.3% within the first two minutes of trading in Riyadh.\n\n\u201cA challenging environment due to slower global growth coupled with additional new capacities together with a decline in oil prices exerted a downward pressure on petrochemical prices in the third quarter of 2019,\u201d Yousef Al-Benyan, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in the statement. \u201cWe are confident about the long-term prospects of the industry and remain focused\u201d on new projects.\n\nLower Growth\n\nWith economic growth projected to be lower this year than last, Sabic expects that the challenges to earnings in the third quarter will persist for the rest of the year. The company continued to review the value of all its assets as part of its annual planning.\n\n\u201cWe think the next quarter could be worse,\u201d Pritish Devassy, head of equity research at Al Rajhi Capital, said in an email. \u201cNext quarter could be the bottom for earnings for the petrochemicals sector.\u201d\n\nThe attacks on Saudi Aramco\u2019s oil facilities in September will have no significant material financial impact on Sabic and \u201cif there will be an impact it will be felt in the fourth quarter,\u201d al-Benyan told reporters in Riyadh. The attacks are estimated to affect about 400,000 to 500,000 tons of petroleum products, he said.\n\nSabic\u2019s profit in the second quarter was also at a 10-year low, when the company results missed analysts estimates that net would be at least 1.77 billion riyals.\n\n(Adds CEO comments in eighth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Dana El Baltaji and Sarah Algethami.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Anthony DiPaola in Dubai at adipaola@bloomberg.net;Abeer Abu Omar in Dubai at aabuomar@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nayla Razzouk at nrazzouk2@bloomberg.net, Bruce Stanley\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Basic Industries Corp. posted its lowest quarterly profit in at least a decade as the chemical maker took an impairment charge and cheaper oil put pressure on its product prices.Net income slumped 86% from the previous year to 830 million riyals ($221 million), while sales fell 23%", "authors": ["Anthony Dipaola", "Abeer Abu Omar"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oYyh.r2eoBIvUjMJUcPKjQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/bf92b83e53394e1d6cbf431a377f6f9b", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
