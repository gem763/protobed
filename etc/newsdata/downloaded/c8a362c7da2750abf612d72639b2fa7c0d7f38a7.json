The qualification criteria for both debates were the same.\n\nMr. Steyer\u2019s apparent qualification would put at least 11 candidates into the fourth debate, unless someone drops out of the race beforehand.\n\nThat means the Ohio debate will likely move back to a two-night affair. That was the case with the debates that were held in June and July in which a total of 20 candidates participated - 10 on each of two nights.\n\nIn order to qualify for the first two debates, candidates had to secure contributions from 65,000 individual donors or hit 1% support in three qualifying polls.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
