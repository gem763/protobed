But others who have certainly earned their shot will end their seasons without a call to The Show.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the most important prospects to watch as the season draws to a close, as well as the two biggest names snubbed from their first promotion to the majors.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nGavin Lux, Los Angeles Dodgers, INF\n\nMinor League stats (two levels): .347/.421/.607, 26 HR, 25 2B, 10 SB, 76 RBI, 99 R\n\nLux caught on quick with the Dodgers, delivering hits in his first two major league at-bats, to show he\u2019s got a gift for first impressions.\n\nThe 21-year-old posted jaw-dropping numbers in first 15 games with Triple-A Oklahoma City, where he finished with a .392 average, 1.197 OPS, 13 homers and 39 RBIs in 49 games. His power production has taken leaps forward as he\u2019s matured physically since being drafted out of high school in 2016.\n\nLux is a natural shortstop and has played the bulk of his minor league games (90 of 108 starts) at the position. But he\u2019s played second base in two games with Los Angeles.\n\nThere are questions about where he might fit in on the already stacked Dodgers. Corey Seager pushed him out of his natural position to a spot usually occupied by Max Muncy, who might recover from a wrist fracture in time for the postseason.\n\nLux is also another left-handed bat in a lineup full of them. He batted .329 (28-for-85) against southpaws in the minors, but still may lose at-bats against lefties in favor of Enrique Hernandez or Jedd Gyorko. But a good month might be all it takes for Lux to stick with the Dodgers through October. And he\u2019s already proven to be capable of that.\n\nBrusdar Graterol, Minnesota Twins, RHP\n\nMinor League stats (three levels): 7-0, 1.92 ERA, 61 IP, 61 SO, 23 BB, 0.98 WHIP, .179 OBA\n\nGraterol is one of 19 pitchers on the Twins current staff, but he\u2019s the only one that\u2019s gone more than a year since taking a loss. The 21-year-old dealt with a right shoulder impingement for much of the season. And last year was the first time he eclipsed 100 innings after missing all of 2016 to recover from Tommy John surgery.\n\nBut he was able to maintain the electric fastball that was on display in his major league debut against the Detroit Tigers on Sunday. His sinking heater is his most impressive offering, and it stayed consistent between 98-100 mph in his scoreless inning against the Tigers.\n\nHe also possesses a plus 88-90 mph slider. The Venezuelan native didn\u2019t showcase his slower curveball or changeup against Detroit, but his fastball-slider combination is more than sufficient for a bullpen role.\n\nMinnesota built a significant lead on the Cleveland Indians with the most productive offense in baseball and a stingy pitching staff which ranks fifth in the American League in overall ERA (4.17).\n\nThe Twins are down a man in their rotation as Kyle Gibson deals with ulcerative colitis. Reliever Sam Dyson, who was acquired from the San Francisco Giants at the trade deadline, has pitched much better than his 7.15 ERA would suggest, allowing three earned runs in his past 10.2 innings (2.53 ERA).\n\nEven with a loaded staff, there\u2019s still an opportunity for Graterol to pitch in October, even if it is from the bullpen.\n\nKyle Tucker has nine hits in his first 67 major league at-bats.

He and right-hander Forrest Whitley survived the Astros\u2019 prospect purge, which built one of the best rosters in baseball. The club sent away J.B. Bukauskas, Seth Beer, Joshua Rojas and Corbin Martin to acquire Zack Greinke at the deadline.\n\nDue to an awful turn of events, there might be some space in the Astros\u2019 lineup opening for the 22-year-old. George Springer suffered an injury that required him to be carted off the field in Milwaukee on Tuesday night. A natural corner outfielder, Tucker played 60 games in right field, 40 games in left and 11 at first base.\n\nTucker can force his way on to the postseason roster, but it\u2019s going to take some work. He took steps forward in terms of power and speed, but his average (66 points), on-base percentage (46 points) and slugging (35 points) are all lower than last season. He also struck out in 25.1 percent of his at-bats, an increase from the 20.6 mark he posted last summer.\n\nBut just like Lux, Tucker has a history of getting hot at the right time. He closed his minor league season an absolute tear in 2018, batting .449 (35-for-78) with 10 homers in his final 19 games.\n\nSean Murphy, Oakland Athletics, C\n\nMinor League stats (two levels): .293/.384/.580, 11 HR, 8 2B, 22 BB, 31 RBI, 34 R, 41 G\n\nWhen he can stay on the field, Murphy is one of the best catcher prospects in the game.\n\nA torn left meniscus limited him severely in his fourth professional season. But he persevered to hit .308 with a 1.011 OPS in 31 games with Triple-A Las Vegas \u2014 an added bonus for a prospect whom many consider to be defense-first.\n\nMurphy\u2019s numbers behind the plate weren\u2019t as eye-popping as last season, where he threw out 23 of 67 base stealers and committed only three errors nearly 600 innings. He made four errors and threw out six of 30 attempted base stealers in 2019, but the skill set remained evident.\n\nHe\u2019ll make his first start for Oakland on Wednesday night after Josh Phegley caught both games since Murphy was recalled on Sunday. Phegley and Chris Herrmann are the only other catchers on Oakland\u2019s active roster.\n\nNeither rank among the better catchers in defensive metrics, and Phegley is batting .246 and Herrmann is hitting .195.\n\nScouts believe Murphy will be a mainstay in the Oakland lineup long beyond this season, so there\u2019s an opportunity for Murphy to not only play in the postseason, should the A\u2019s hang on to their wild card spot, but also take over a starting role.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nA few more new names to know this month:\n\n\u2022 Andrew Knizer (St. Louis Cardinals) is in a position similar to Tucker, where he has something to prove after struggling in previous chances in the majors. He\u2019s also stuck behind an All-Star named Yadier Molina behind the dish.\n\n\u2022 Nate Lowe (Tampa Bay Rays) it all comes down to opportunity for Lowe, who hit .294 with six homers in 32 games for Tampa Bay earlier this season. He\u2019s got Ji-Man Choi and Jesus Aguilar to contend with at first base.\n\n\u2022 Jon Duplantier (Arizona Diamondbacks) and Adbert Alzolay (Chicago Cubs) probably won\u2019t fit into their team\u2019s rotation, but no bullpen is beyond help in 2019.\n\nShould Luis Robert come up in September?\n\n\n\nOzzie Guillen would \"just to please my player and to please the organization, to say thank you.\" pic.twitter.com/NtMA1Wk7S9 \u2014 White Sox Talk (@NBCSWhiteSox) August 31, 2019\n\nSnubs show disappointing pattern\n\nThere is, more or less, a direct correlation between which top prospects get boosted to the majors after Sept. 1, and their parent organization\u2019s chances at making the postseason.\n\nIn an ideal world, a prospect plays well enough at the highest level \u2014 or perhaps lower, i.e. Juan Soto and Fernando Tatis Jr. \u2014 of the minors to force the club\u2019s hand. In an ideal world, Baltimore Orioles prospect Ryan Mountcastle or Chicago White Sox prospect Luis Robert would be major leaguers.\n\nBut, they exist in a world of service-time manipulation. That\u2019s a world where it might not be in the best long-term interests of the Orioles to get a couple wins better, catch the Miami Marlins, and drop a spot in the draft while also starting Mountcastle\u2019s clock in the process.\n\nMountcastle earned International League MVP honors after batting .312 with 25 homers, 35 doubles and 83 RBIs for Triple-A Norfolk. He was their first-round pick in 2015.\n\nRobert was named USA Today Minor League Player of the Year after crushing 32 homers, stealing 36 bases and batting .328 across three levels of the minors. He played 122 games in 2019 after playing just 78 total in his first two seasons in pro ball after signing out of Cuba in 2017.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays faced this dilemma last season with Vladimir Guerrero Jr.. The same could be said about the New York Mets and Pete Alonso. The White Sox are repeat offenders after keeping Eloy Jimenez in the minors last September.\n\nThese are the decisions that create controversies that persist until the player gets their shot \u2014 especially for a losing or on-the-bubble team. But the argument can be made that these decisions prove that winning isn\u2019t always a top priority.", "description": "As the 2019 MLB season enters its home stretch, there are a number of top prospects worth watching that can contribute in September.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bYsEJuPb.z54mFs1zDnTrQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NzEuNDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2hwyR_khFNjTbp1LNjW15A--~B/aD0yMTc4O3c9MzE5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/79ddd490-cf38-11e9-bf7b-768ade696c12"}
