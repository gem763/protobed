REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nScott Kupor, managing partner of $10 billion venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference that it would be \u201cdangerous\u201d to generalize from the WeWork situation as it stems from the confluence of multiple factors.\n\nThese include governance issues, being a \u201clate cycle, cash-consuming\u201d company, and the tension between traditional real estate valuation methods and the more forward-looking ones favored by some in Silicon Valley, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the public market investor is struggling with in these hybrid companies,\u201d Kupor said. \u201cHow much of the business looks like a hardware or other business and how much does it truly have margins and moats that look like a technology company?\u201d\n\nAndreessen Horowitz is not a WeWork investor.\n\nWeWork owner The We Company postponed its initial public offering this month following a barrage of questions surrounding its valuation. Reuters reported last week that The We Company was considering seeking a valuation in its IPO of between $10 billion and $12 billion, a steep discount from the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January.\n\nGlen Kacher, chief investment officer of $2 billion Light Street Capital Management LLC, said no one should be surprised by rapidly changing valuations for private companies such as WeWork, given how common large price swings are in public markets.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the market,\u201d Kacher said, speaking alongside Kupor at the annual New York City event. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nKacher contrasted WeWork with Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N), one of Light Street\u2019s investments.\n\nHe said Uber\u2019s \u201cSaaS,\u201d or software as a service, creates significant value because its cars and drivers can be used by many customers every day, whereas a set of WeWork\u2019s rented desks can only be used by one client at a time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where technology is marrying up with these fixed assets to create services ... that\u2019s a very unique economic solution (for Uber),\u201d he said. \u201cAs opposed to WeWork, which is just carving a floor up into very tiny little spaces. That\u2019s their technology.\u201d\n\nKacher said he continues to find SoftBank Group (9984.T) an \u201cinteresting\u201d investment opportunity, in part because Uber represents a bigger part of its portfolio than WeWork.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission head Jay Clayton, in an on-stage interview at the conference, would not comment on WeWork\u2019s IPO directly.\n\nHe did say, however, that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t surprise\u201d him that there would be differing valuations in public and private markets for the same type of company.\n\n\u201cThe price discovery mechanism is completely different,\u201d Clayton said.", "description": "Two top technology investors cautioned against drawing broadconclusions about the valuation of private companies from questions swirling around U.S. office-sharing startup WeWork.", "authors": ["Lawrence Delevingne", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431694472&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1PL-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
