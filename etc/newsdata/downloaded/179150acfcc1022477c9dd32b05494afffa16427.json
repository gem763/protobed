These iconoclastic, speak-truth-to-power sleuths exist on the left, right and middle, although these days they seem to be concentrated on the right.\n\nOn the left, we might point to Glenn Greenwald, with whom I mostly disagree politically, but I think is brilliant. In the middle, there is Sharyl Attkisson, formerly of CBS News, who did absolutely outstanding investigations there. So many of them got spiked by CBS management because they didn\u2019t reflect kindly on the Obama administration that she quit CBS. On the right, there are many great investigators I could point to, but one I\u2019d like to highlight here is Joel Gilbert, whose new documentary, The Trayvon Hoax, I had the opportunity to preview before its release. It will officially be released on September 16 along with a book by the same name.\n\nJoel\u2019s expose in this film of the truth behind a gross legal fraud in the case of the death of Trayvon Martin is entertaining, illuminating and greatly troubling. Joel used publicly available records, traditional gumshoe pavement-pounding, and clever forensic techniques to demonstrate what the prosecutors trying to railroad George Zimmerman for the \u201cmurder\u201d of Trayvon Martin apparently failed to do: Expose the central witness in the case as a complete fraud. And the prosecutors, who would actually \u201cpray\u201d with the family of the victim for a successful prosecution in what had to be a first in legal annals, had far more time and resources available to them than did Joel.\n\nFor those who need a refresher: George Zimmerman was charged with second degree murder, after he was forced to kill Trayvon Martin in an act of self-defense on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman was standing in a common area of his Sanford, Florida housing complex that rainy night, trying to protect his neighborhood, which had been suffering from serial burglaries. He had spotted Martin suspiciously standing outside in the rain, with no apparent purpose, and was naturally concerned. As Zimmerman tried to determine exactly where he was situated, in order to help police get to him in order to question Martin, the much larger Trayvon Martin confronted Zimmerman and assaulted him in an unprovoked attack. After pinning Zimmerman down and pounding his head on the ground, Zimmerman drew his legally possessed firearm and shot Martin, killing him.\n\nMartin\u2019s death was then seized upon by a mainstream media that seemed obsessed with racial strife, or creating it, during the Obama years. In a crass effort to advance a white-racist-attacks-unarmed-helpless-black-kid narrative when the story first broke, CNN described Zimmerman as a \u201cwhite Hispanic\u201d in what might have been the first use of this bizarre modifier-noun combination.\n\nOne of the key pieces of evidence used against Zimmerman was a recorded phone call between a young woman named Diamond Eugene and attorney Benjamin Crump. Eugene had been Martin\u2019s girlfriend and the last person to speak to Martin the night of his death, other than Zimmerman. Crump was representing the Martin family. That phone call launched a media-fueled frenzy to arrest George Zimmerman, prompted President Obama to equate Trayvon Martin to a hypothetical Obama \u201cson\u201d, and fired up race hustlers like Al Sharpton.\n\nIn that phone call, in which Crump appeared to lead the witness, an emotional Eugene insisted the shooting of Trayvon was \u201cracial\u201d and \u201cHe ain\u2019t do nothing. He was just like going to get his little brother a Skittle and a Arizona ice tea. That\u2019s it.\u201d That was enough for the media to run with and launch what would become a seeming race war, with the eventual creation of Black Lives Matter, the assassination of five Dallas police officers at a BLM event, a fake \u201cHands up! Don\u2019t shoot!\u201d narrative following the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, with accompanying riots, and yet more riots in Baltimore following the death in police custody of drug dealer Freddie Gray.\n\nThe problem for the prosecutors of Zimmerman was that the real Diamond Eugene refused to testify, probably realizing that she was digging a deeper and deeper hole for herself. So somehow, another woman named Rachel Jeantel pretending to be \u201cDiamond\u201d took the stand, in what became one of the most farcical courtroom spectacles ever witnessed, as her fraudulence quickly became apparent while she unraveled on the witness stand. The real Diamond Eugene never appeared to the public, however.\n\nGeorge Zimmerman was acquitted of the murder charge and, thankfully, justice prevailed.\n\nWhat Joel has done here, though, is document a long effort to track down the real Diamond Eugene who provided the heart-tugging testimony which helped launch the Left\u2019s modern race war. Through his various painstaking efforts, and especially his analysis of the records from the legal proceedings, such as the wealth of information taken off Trayvon Martin\u2019s cell phone, and Diamond Eugene\u2019s social media archives, Joel has reconstructed the last few months of Trayvon and Diamond\u2019s lives in that fateful period. And Joel uses that to expose the much larger fraud on the American people that the Trayvon Martin hoax ignited.\n\nJoel\u2019s treatment of the subject, while serious, is injected with humor. An affluent, well-educated, Caucasian film producer, he must immerse himself in \u201curban English\u201d in order to both understand and communicate with the subjects of his research, who inhabit a subculture very alien to him. He visits little Haiti in Miami (Eugene\u2019s family is of Haitian descent), and Tallahassee, to chase down leads and eventually set Diamond Eugene up in a sting operation that will warm the heart of my fellow gumshoes.\n\nThe levity, however, serves to balance out the very serious social turmoil that the film ably demonstrates was generated by the Trayvon Martin hoax. Joel is very measured in his assessment of Martin, viewing him as fundamentally a good kid who went down a dark path in the last months of his life, and whose death was then exploited by the worst of our media and political elite to feed racial strife in our nation.\n\nA trailer for the documentary is available here and copies of both the book and movie are available at the film\u2019s website. The film will be screened at the National Press Club in Washington on September 16 at 1 PM with free admission to all. Gilbert will also take questions from the media.\n\nI salute my fellow investigators, including Joel, who are willing to take the phony stories head-on and use their skills to expose the truth. As conservatives, we should all support the efforts to fight back against the mainstream media-set fake narratives that only serve to grind down our great nation.\n\nWilliam F.
