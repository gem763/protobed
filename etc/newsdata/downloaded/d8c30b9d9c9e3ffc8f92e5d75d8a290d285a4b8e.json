There's a total of 25 products hidden behind the drawers.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe cream and metallic gold packaging is absolutely dreamy, meaning this fabulous countdown would make the perfect gift for a beautyholic (or a treat for yourself).\n\nBeauty fans can expect to find all the top beauty brands, such as NARS, Laura Mercier and Charlotte Tilbury.\n\nEven better, there's also an invitation to receive a complimentary gift or beauty service at one of the John Lewis in-store counters.\n\nSee below for a full list of the products inside.\n\nWhat's inside the John Lewis Beauty Advent Calendar?\n\nNeom Organics London Tranquility Scented Candle (Full Size)\n\nSisley Suprem\u00ffa Anti-Ageing Night Cream, 1ml\n\nSisley Suprem\u00ffa Eyes At Night, 2ml\n\nThe Soap Co.
