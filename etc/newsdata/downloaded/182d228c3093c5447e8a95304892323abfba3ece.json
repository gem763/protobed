Sutton, the Chinese 11,000-ton Type 094 Jin Class submarine suddenly emerged from the deep among a fishing fleet operating off the Paracel Islands.\n\nIt\u2019s a highly unusual event.\n\nWas it a deliberate act of intimidation? Or an accident embarrassingly seen by competitors?\n\nThe single purpose of ballistic-missile carrying, nuclear-powered submarine such as the Jin Class is to remain underwater for months on end. To remain unseen. To be enough of a menace to deter any surprise attack.\n\nMr Sutton says using such a submarine to \u201csend a message\u201d to Vietnam goes against all expectations.\n\n\u201cSurfacing next to another country\u2019s vessel is unusual and suggests that something has gone wrong,\u201d he writes. \u201cSomething serious enough to warrant sacrificing its main asset: stealth.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera An unverified photo of a Chinese Type 094 nuclear-powered submarine surfacing beside a Vietnamese fishing vessel.

In essence, it is the entire mass of water between it and Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\nIts string of illegally constructed artificial island fortresses turns the entire area into a Chinese-controlled lake. Entry through the narrow island choke-points can be closely monitored. And its nuclear submarines can hide in its depths, secure in the knowledge that any opposing submarine or aircraft will find it challenging to break in.\n\n\u201cThe Jin Class is the newest missile submarine in the Chinese arsenal,\u201d Mr Sutton writes in Forbes . \u201cSix have been built and are already the backbone of China\u2019s at-sea nuclear deterrent.\u201d\n\nThe fishing boat scare has only just been revealed in Vietnamese media after the incident occurred last month.\n\n\u201cPossibly the submarine had become entangled in a fishing net, or feared that it would be,\u201d Mr Sutton writes. \u201cSurfacing may have saved the lives of the fishermen, or the submariners.\u201d\n\nThe submarine surfaced more than 300km from its home base at Sanya on the Chinese island of Hainan.\n\nmedia_camera Chinese navy submarines have been aggressively patrolling the disputed South China Sea for months.

A Vietnamese-Russian gas and oil drilling operation has been the centre of an interference operation, with China attempting to assert its ownership of a region called the Vanguard Bank.\n\n\u201cChina is expanding its grip on the resource-rich sea, but has been careful enough to do this gradually, step by step,\u201d geopolitical affairs analyst Bahauddin Foizee writes. \u201cThis slow approach attracts lesser outcry from the international community. Using time as a weapon, China is slowly expanding its grip.\u201d\n\nGROWING RESISTANCE\n\nThe cluster of about 130 small coral islands and reefs that forms the Paracel Islands covers some 15,000sq km roughly halfway between the Chinese mainland and Vietnam. The People\u2019s Liberation Army of China expelled Vietnamese forces from the area during a short war in 1974.\n\nVietnam has never relinquished its claim to the territory, even though Beijing has built a fortress-air base on one of the largest land masses \u2014 Woody Island.\n\nVietnam earlier this week told a South China Sea forum being held between ASEAN nations and China that ongoing territorial infringements were harming the region.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Dung said \u201ccomplicated developments\u201d had strained discussions around China\u2019s proposed South China Sea \u201cCode of Conduct\u201d.\n\nMr Nguyen asserted Vietnam\u2019s right under the United Nations Law of the Sea to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) based on its shores and continental shelf. Beijing, a signatory to the law, rejects this \u2014 and instead insists it owns the entire South China Sea right up to the coasts of neighbouring nations.\n\nBut, at the weekend, Vietnam\u2019s Chairman Nguyen Phu Trong said he was \u201cprepared for possible opportunities and challenges\u201d in the South China Sea where he would \u201ctenaciously\u201d defend his nation\u2019s rights.\n\nOf particular concern was the sighting of a Chinese oil drilling rig moving into waters contained within Vietnam\u2019s EEZ. Similar Chinese interference actions have been noted in Malaysian and Philippine waters in recent months.\n\nmedia_camera Woody Island in the South China Sea.

However, security alliances among some of the ASEAN member states and some extra-ASEAN countries like Australia, India and Japan cannot be ruled out.\u201d\n\nJamie Seidel is a freelance writer @JamieSeidel\n\nOriginally published as Chinese sub in \u2018embarrassing\u2019 accident", "description": "An enormous nuclear submarine has mysteriously surfaced in the disputed South China Sea in what experts have described as a highly unusual event.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b5ee6558be6ec55b6e32f7dd6c929f28", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
