Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS\n\nHere is some of the reaction from both sides of the flap:\n\n- \u201cAs a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong. Now, in pursuit of $$, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.\u201d - Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, on Twitter.\n\n- \u201cWe must put human rights above profit. And that means standing with #HongKong. The NBA\u2019s refusal to denounce Communist China is shameful. I\u2019m requesting a meeting with @NBA Commissioner Silver to discuss the importance of supporting the brave individuals fighting for freedom.\u201d - Republican U.S. Senator Rick Scott of Florida, on Twitter.\n\n- \u201cUm, yeah, we apologise, you know. You know, we love China, we love playing there. ... They show us the most support and love, so, you know, we appreciate them as a fan base, and we love everything, you know, they\u2019re about and we appreciate the support they give us, individually and as an organization, so ... we love you.\u201d - Houston Rockets guard James Harden, in a Reuters TV interview.\n\n- \u201cI watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I\u2019m still a Chinese person first and foremost.\u201d - one social media user.\n\n- \u201cThe NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights. In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.\u201d - Republican U.S. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, in a statement.\n\n- \u201cThe one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China, is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country\u2019s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable. ... I don\u2019t know Daryl personally. I am sure he\u2019s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d - Joseph Tsai, owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team and co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), on his personal Facebook page.\n\n- \u201cAnd the #NBA, which (correctly) has no problem with players/employees criticizing our gov\u2019t, is now apologising for criticizing the Chinese gov\u2019t. This is shameful and cannot stand.\u201d - Democratic U.S. Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, on Twitter, referring to the league\u2019s policy of not imposing fines on NBA players protesting deadly police shootings in the United States.\n\n- \u201cChina is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\u201d - Julian Castro, Democratic presidential contender and former U.S. housing secretary.\n\n- Morey \u201chas the right to express his values, and Chinese fans of the Houston Rockets have the right to abandon this team. If the Rockets want to keep its Chinese market, the team need to avoid offending Chinese public.\u201d - Hu Xijin, editor of the state-controlled Global Times newspaper, in a tweet.\n\n- \u201cChinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators - and NBA wants to \u2018bridge cultural divides\u2019? Cultural divides?\u201d - Republican U.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, referring to allegations of human rights abuses in China.\n\n- \u201cWe want to express our indignation and strong condemnation. We have already stopped our cooperation with the Houston Rockets, and continue to urge them to give a clear answer on this matter.\u201d - Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning, on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.\n\n- \u201cThis is bigger than just the @NBA. It\u2019s about #China\u2019s growing ability to restrict freedom of expression here in the U.S.\n\n\u201cTV networks,airlines,hotel chains,retailers & Hollywood already self censor.\n\n\u201cNow private citizens risk losing their jobs if they offend China.\u201d - Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, in a tweet.\n\n- \u201cNo one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom.\u201d - Democratic U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, in a tweet.\n\n- \u201cSPD Bank Credit Card Center expresses strong protest and opposition to the wrong remarks made by Houston Rockets\u2019 General Manager Daryl Morey.\u201d - statement on the Chinese bank\u2019s Weibo account in which it said it had suspended related marketing activities and publicity.\n\n- \u201cI\u2019m hurting for them (the Rockets) today ... because (retired star Rockets player) Yao Ming is the biggest reason that NBA today is as popular as it is in China. And Yao and others, and the Rockets in particular, have probably done more to promote the game of basketball than any other team.\u201d - Golden State Warriors President and Chief Operating Officer Rick Welts, in an interview on CNBC, who predicted a bright future for the NBA in China.", "description": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) took heavy fire on Monday for saying a weekend tweet by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, which supported Hong Kong protests for democracy, was \"regrettable\" and \"inappropriate.\"", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438202744&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9615R", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
