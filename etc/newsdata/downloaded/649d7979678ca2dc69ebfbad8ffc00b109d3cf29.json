Groups of teenage girls brave the drizzle and eat Korean-style hotdogs on street corners after shopping for cosmetics and K-pop merchandise.\n\nThis is not Seoul, but Shin-\u014ckubo, a little slice of Korea in central Tokyo. It is home to a large ethnic Korean community, some the descendants of people at the heart of a dispute between Japan and South Korea that local business owners fear is turning them into collateral victims.\n\nIn recent weeks, Tokyo and Seoul have exchanged tit-for-tat measures as discord has widened from a long-running row over Koreans who were brought to Japan to work in mines and factories before and during the second world war.\n\nAfter South Korean courts ordered Japanese companies to compensate the workers last year, the spat intensified and has now spread to trade, security cooperation, tourism and even preparations for next summer\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nWhenever relations worsen, we receive threats, including towards our children and grandchildren\n\n\u201cThe number of customers has dropped by about half in recent months,\u201d said the owner of a shop selling Korean cosmetics, who asked not to be named. \u201cYoung women still shop here, but older people just glance inside and walk on. It never used to be like this.\u201d\n\nThe woman, who has run her shop for more than 20 years, said the country of her birth and the one she now calls home were at risk of becoming permanent adversaries. \u201cThey are poles apart. Japan insists that all compensation claims from the war have been settled, but how would you feel if, say, your grandfather was a forced wartime labourer?\n\n\u201cI have more Japanese friends than Korean ones here, but we avoid talking about politics because we know we would go round in circles.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Japan placed restrictions on exports of semiconductor materials that are considered vital to South Korea\u2019s tech industry and followed up by ending South Korea\u2019s fast-track export status.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Business owners in Shin-\u014ckubo are concerned about the fallout from the dispute between Japan and South Korea.

The government saw the measure as retaliation for the court rulings against Japanese firms, and promptly removed Japan from its own \u201cwhite list\u201d of trading partners that receive preferential treatment.\n\nHowever, some shop owners said their businesses were weathering the diplomatic storm. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t really affected us, but that\u2019s probably because young people are less interested in politics,\u201d says Choi Dong-han, whose store sells K-pop memorabilia.\n\nYoung Japanese devotees of South Korea\u2019s most successful cultural export still flock here to buy posters, DVDs and miniature figures of BTS, Tohoshinki and Big Bang, added Choi, who moved to Tokyo from South Korea two decades ago. \u201cBut I hope Japan and South Korea can sort out their differences. We\u2019re neighbours, so we have to get along.\u201d\n\nRelations, however, are far from neighbourly. Seoul has called on the International Olympic Committee to ban Japan\u2019s rising-sun flag \u2013 seen by some Koreans as a symbol of Japanese militarism \u2013 from next year\u2019s Summer Games in Tokyo. A recent poll found that South Koreans trust North Korea more than they do Japan.\n\nLate last month, South Korea scrapped an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan. Experts have warned the move could harm the countries\u2019 ability to counter North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear threat, while the US has put pressure on Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to drag their countries back from the brink of a long and damaging diplomatic estrangement.\n\nMedia in both countries have been accused of peddling cultural stereotypes and whipping up nationalist sentiment. Some South Koreans have responded to calls to boycott Japanese products, including cosmetics, beer and clothes, while the number of South Koreans visiting Japan in August was 48% down on the same month last year.\n\nIn a recent editorial, the left-leaning Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun accused other sections of the Japanese media of \u201ctrying to stir up hatred towards South Korea\u201d.\n\nThe paper reserved most scorn for the Shukan Post weekly magazine, which ran a series titled \u201cGoodbye to our annoying neighbour: Why we don\u2019t need South Korea\u201d. It also published an article citing academic research claiming that Koreans are pathologically incapable of controlling their emotions \u2013 an anti-Korean trope among the Japanese right.\n\nWhile North Korean missile tests have in the past prompted ugly street protests by rightwing extremists against Japan\u2019s Korean community, locals say this has not been the case during the most recent row, thanks in part to a controversial 2016 law aimed at curbing hate speech.\n\n\u201cWe are ordinary people trying to make a life here in Japan,\u201d said Yuh Keun-ie, president of the central headquarters of the Korean Residents Union in Japan, an organisation that represents about two-thirds of the 610,000 Korean residents in Japan who have not become naturalised Japanese citizens. Many of the rest belong to Chongryon, an association of Korean residents sympathetic to North Korea.\n\n\u201cBut whenever relations between Japan and Korea worsen, we receive threats, including towards our children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nYuh, who has seven grandchildren, two of whom have taken Japanese citizenship, added: \u201cWe are not interested in politics. All we care about is our livelihoods \u2013 that with hard work, talent and a bit of luck we can lead comfortable lives and contribute to the local community.\u201d", "description": "Worsening relations between the two countries now affecting trade, security, tourism and day-to-day life", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9de7e223e11a02ad290a3d8f9c5e860894c8a772/0_829_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=887021e8aa655deca04e668a63830006", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
