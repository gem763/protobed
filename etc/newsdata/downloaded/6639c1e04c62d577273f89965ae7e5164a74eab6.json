Blame the bomb cyclone, aka \"explosive cyclogenesis.\"\n\n\"It was a wild night with wind gusts up to 90 mph in Provincetown,\" the National Weather Service's Boston office tweeted. West Island was hit almost as hard, with a gust of 84 mph reported.\n\nA bomb cyclone occurs when the barometric pressure falls at least 24 millibars, or 0.71 inches, within 24 hours. The faster and steeper the drop, known as bombogenesis, the more intense the storm.\n\n\"We did that and then some, that's for sure,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Bill Deger told USA TODAY. \"In some areas we saw it drop 30 to 35 millibars in 12 hours.\"\n\nA house is trapped under a tree that toppled from strong winds on Oct. 17, 2019, in Danvers, Mass. More\n\nBoston smashed its record low barometric pressure for October, reaching 975.3 millibars after falling 35 in 12 hours. Wind gusts reached 70 mph at Boston Logan International Airport, just short of hurricane status. Some areas of the state were drenched with up to 4 inches of rain in two hours.\n\nThe result: \"You could say it was the strongest storm ever to impact the area in October,\" Deger said. \"We had the rain, we had the wind, we had the coastal impact. We had it all.\"\n\nOn Cape Cod, schools were delayed or canceled and more than 38,000 Eversource power customers were in the dark. Traffic was at a standstill in some areas because of roads blocked by downed trees, poles and wires.\n\nThe storm's fury stretched far beyond Massachusetts. Some Amtrak trains across the Northeast corridor were delayed by the weather. In New York, high winds at La Guardia Airport on Thursday caused some arriving flights to be delayed an average of 1 hour and 47 minutes, the FAA said. And the Yankees-Astros baseball playoff game Wednesday night was canceled because of heavy rains and high winds.\n\nIn Maine, more than 200,000 power customers \u2013 a quarter of the state \u2013 were without power and the number was rising Thursday. Even without power, residents overwhelmed Central Maine Power's website.\n\n\"We appreciate your patience as our crews respond to outages \u2013 restoring power as quickly and safely as possible,\" the utility said on Twitter. \"We are also working diligently to fix all technical website issues.\"\n\nConnecticut and New Hampshire each reported about 40,000 outages, and scores of school districts canceled classes Thursday.\n\nMost of Somers, Connecticut, was dark. Schools were closed and the town of less than 12,000 posted on social media a list of more than two dozen places where downed wires or trees were creating traffic havoc.\n\n\"Good morning \u2013 if you can call it that!\" the town posted on its Facebook page.\n\nIn Chester County, Pennsylvania, three people died and eight were injured when a van crashed late Wednesday, state police said. The cause of the accident remains under investigation. However, AccuWeather meteorologists say rainy weather could be to blame.\n\n\u201cAt the time of the crash, heavy rain was falling across the area and could have been a factor,\u201d AccuWeather meteorologist Jake Sojda said.\n\nMost of the rain was ending Thursday, but Deger warned that strong winds will persist across much of the region through the day. Some minor flooding was reported, but Deger said weeks with little or no rain eased what could have been a much worse situation.\n\n\"This was a welcome rain, even though it fell over the course of a few hours,\" he said. \"And I guess they didn't want it blowing in at 70 mph.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Power outages: Northeast storm, bomb cyclone hit Boston, Maine", "description": "An 'explosive cyclogenesis' or bomb cyclone hit the Northeast, causing widespread power outages in Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/08pGNWF1KxiU9jjeeN8CCA--~B/aD0yMjAwO3c9MzMwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/0fa8f4cf838536f99ad25f94b87c632e", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
