REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo\n\nSAP announced the management overhaul, with immediate effect, after rushing out third-quarter results that showed it gaining traction in its drive to offer a more streamlined range of services and boost profitability.\n\nThe announcement brings down the curtain on an era in which McDermott struck a string of multi-billion-dollar deals that established SAP as Europe\u2019s pre-eminent technology group but also created complexity that frustrated many clients.\n\n\u201cSAP would not be what it is today without Bill McDermott,\u201d said Hasso Plattner, a co-founder of SAP who chairs the company\u2019s supervisory board.\n\n\u201cBill made invaluable contributions to this company and he was a main driver of SAP\u2019s transition to the cloud, which will fuel our growth for many years to come.\u201d\n\nPlattner founded SAP in the early 1970s with three former IBM colleagues. He exerted quiet influence from behind the scenes, giving room for extrovert McDermott to play the role of showman and salesman.\n\nThe new leadership combines Morgan\u2019s focus on customer relationships in SAP\u2019s North American markets with Klein\u2019s background in process innovation that is rooted in SAP\u2019s German heritage.\n\n\u201cBill was able to place SAP firmly in the cloud market and begin a difficult transition to an entirely new way of doing business, all the while still delivering the revenues investors were looking for. That\u2019s no mean feat,\u201d said Joshua Greenbaum, principal at EAConsult.\n\n\u201cJen and Christian are in a good position to further SAP\u2019s own transformation while delivering the technology to fuel their customers\u2019 own transformations. It won\u2019t be easy by any stretch of the imagination, but the foundational elements are in place.\u201d\n\nACTIVIST INVESTOR\n\nMcDermott\u2019s exit follows the entry this year of activist investor Elliott, amid broader market concern that his acquisitions - including last year\u2019s $8 billion deal to buy customer relationship platform Qualtrics - had caused SAP to lose focus.\n\nHe responded by launching an efficiency drive, promising to expand profit margins by 5 percentage points through 2023. After a wobble in the second quarter, SAP\u2019s latest results showed the strategy shift was delivering positive results.\n\nGrowth in new cloud bookings more than doubled to 38%, lifted by a major three-year cloud deal with an unnamed partner, while operating margins expanded by an underlying 1.7 percentage points.\n\nMcDermott, speaking on a late-night call with reporters, denied bowing to pressure from Elliott, saying he would have had to decide on renewing his contract in early 2020. He chose not to, on his own terms, in consultation with Plattner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed a great run and an exciting ride,\u201d said the 58-year-old New Yorker, who has worn dark glasses since he was blinded in one eye by an accident at home. He will stay on in an advisory role until the end of the year.\n\n\u201cYou get to the point where you\u2019ve done what you set out to do and then some,\u201d he added. Asked about his future plans, McDermott answered that it was too early to say before adding with typical ebullience: \u201cI\u2019m just getting warmed up.\u201d\n\nSAP has brought fresh management talent to the fore over the past year in preparation for the handover.\n\nMorgan, a polished saleswoman who joined SAP in 2004, was handed board-level responsibility for cloud and \u2018go-to-market\u2019 operations.\n\nKlein, who came to SAP as a student, was promoted to the position of chief operating officer. He has managed SAP\u2019s flagship S/4HANA database - the \u2018brain\u2019 for applications that include finance, human resources and logistics.\n\nYet some clients, in particular in its home market, have become increasingly vocal about the challenges of upgrading SAP\u2019s complex products for the digital era, instead demanding \u2018out-of-the-box\u2019 solutions.\n\n\u201cBill has always had a desire to hear from customers - he wanted to know from me what customers had to say, both the good and the bad,\u201d says Geoff Scott, head of the American SAP User Group (ASUG).\n\nThat discontent has created an opening for long-time rival Oracle (ORCL.N), which trumpeted its success in winning over SAP clients with its own cloud business suite at a recent U.S. user conference.\n\nKlein dismissed Oracle\u2019s claims: \u201cNone of the customers that were shown there have left SAP,\u201d he said.", "description": "Bill McDermott stood down on Friday after a decade building up SAP as the world's leading enterprise software company, handing the task of completing its transition to cloud computing to new co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein.", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439496416&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A021", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
