(DAZN/DAZN)\n\nDAZN will broadcast a boxing match between YouTube stars Logan Paul and KSI this fall. The fight, scheduled for Nov. 9, will take place at Staples Center in Los Angeles and will be a rematch of a bout between the Internet celebrities that aired on YouTube pay-per-view last August.\n\nThe fight is as much spectacle as it is sporting event for the streaming service, which aspires to become the \u201cNetflix of sports\u201d and is still looking for a foothold in the United States. Neither man has a long history in the sport, but both will turn professional for the fight. Still, for DAZN, a direct-to-consumer streaming service that launched in the United States last year, the match is all about eyeballs. And the network is betting it can get a lot of them with Paul and British-born Olajide Olatunji, better known by his stage name of KSI. Each has around 20 million YouTube subscribers.\n\n\u201cAs a new entrant into the U.S. landscape, we\u2019re growing our brand awareness among a young, tech-savvy demographic of sports fan,\u201d said Joe Markowski, DAZN\u2019s North America executive vice president. \u201cThese are the new superstars of the modern era, and we can\u2019t ignore that. This is the social media age, and there is huge fan interest in this fight, and they command a huge digital following.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know how to generate a buzz,\u201d KSI added.\n\n[DAZN\u2019s baseball show is RedZone for MLB, and a test for the network]\n\nLast year, Paul and KSI boxed to a draw in an amateur bout broadcast on YouTube that drew 1.1 million viewers at a cost of $10 each. (Perhaps just as many or more people also watched a pirated stream of the fight.) For the rematch, KSI\u2019s manager, Liam Chivers, said he spoke with platforms ranging from ESPN+ to Facebook to Vimeo before deciding DAZN was the best fit. DAZN declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal.\n\nTo purchase the Paul-KSI fight, viewers will have to buy a monthly subscription to DAZN for $20 or a yearly pass that costs $100. The trick for the network will be to convert those fans into long-term subscribers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see much crossover between this demographic and our existing subscriber base, so it\u2019s a whole new demographic,\u201d Markowski said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll have a month, at least, with every new subscriber to serve them with our wider portfolio.\u201d\n\nDAZN is based in the United Kingdom and available in nine countries. It broadcasts English Premier League and NFL games in Canada, the NFL in Germany and the leading domestic baseball and soccer leagues in Japan. The network\u2019s global chairman is former ESPN president John Skipper, and it continues to seek larger inroads in the United States, where it has focused mostly on combat sports, signing Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin to multimillion dollar contracts. It also has a deal with Major League Baseball for a nightly whip-around highlights show.\n\nPaul said his YouTube audience is 50 percent men ages 18 to 24, which Markowski said could be an asset as DAZN looks to expand into more mainstream sports and leagues in the United States.\n\n\u201cI think it helps us go to them and say we\u2019re innovative and we\u2019ve got the younger audience you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said.\n\nDAZN this fall is scheduled to broadcast a Golovkin fight and a rematch between Anthony Ruiz and Anthony Joshua, and it is expected to announce an Alvarez fight as well. Adding the Paul-KSI fight, network executives hope, will help reduce the month-to-month churn among subscribers.\n\n[Heavyweight champ Andy Ruiz Jr., once bullied for his weight, says \u2018people can relate to me\u2019]\n\nFor the November bout, KSI and Paul have been certified to fight professionally by the California State Athletic Commission, which means they will not wear headgear as they did in their first fight. Neither is particularly well-known for athletic feats. KSI raps and performs on his YouTube channel; Paul rose to fame as a slapstick-style video blogger who has occasionally courted controversy.\n\nBut both said they are taking the fight seriously.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m a real boxer,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019ve done it for a year and a half now, so definitely have some skills. This isn\u2019t just some YouTubers with beef trying to fight. It\u2019s a real fight.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAs ESPN tries to stick to sports, President Jimmy Pitaro must define what that means\n\nESPN\u2019s Don Van Natta on his new TV show and why Twitter is overrated\n\nThe WNBA has craved mainstream attention.
