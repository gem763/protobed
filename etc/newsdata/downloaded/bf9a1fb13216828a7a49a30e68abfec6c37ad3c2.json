What\u2019s more, her return has brought with it plenty of drama \u2014 not to mention having brought plenty of secrets to light too, the biggest of which has yet to be revealed on screen, as it seemingly turns out that Vinny isn\u2019t actually Mandy\u2019s son!\n\nEarlier this year, Mandy made a brief return to the village with a mission, as she set out to prove that Bear Wolf (Joshua Richards) was Paddy\u2019s (Dominic Brunt) biological father. However, as she departed, Vinny questioned why she never revealed the real reason that she came home, thus confirming that she\u2019s hiding something from her family.\n\nSince making a more permanent return to the Dales a couple of months back, Mandy has done nothing but keep secrets from her clan, and it seems as if her and Vinny have been harbouring a pretty game-changing one, as Lisa Riley told The Sun that Vinny\u2019s not actually Mandy\u2019s son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to The Sun, Lisa said: \u2018Who is he? Even I\u2019m yet to find that out \u2013 it\u2019s all still to unfold.\u2019\n\n\u2018But Vinny just wants to be part of the family and although the audience finds out that he\u2019s not Mandy\u2019s son, the Dingles never do \u2013 Mandy makes sure of that.\u2019\n\n\u2018Who is his mother? That\u2019s the big question \u2013 will it be a cast member, we just don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\nThe other big question, of course, is what Mandy\u2019s motivations in lying about Vinny\u2019s parentage could be?\n\nDue to the uncanny resemblance, viewers were convinced that Vinny was Paddy\u2019s son when he first showed up in the village. However, Mandy went out of her way to dispel that theory \u2014 but it\u2019s likely that, whoever they are, Vinny\u2019s parents could be of importance.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Tuesday 15th October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Mandy's been keeping plenty of secrets!", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18_09_emm_vinnie_mandy_02-f9e1_1571155201.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
