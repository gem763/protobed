The retailer has estimated adjusted operating income to be flat to slightly up for its current fiscal year.\n\nThe retailer in August narrowed its current year revenue forecast to $43.1 billion to $43.6 billion, blaming uncertainty about future consumer behavior and the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThe first phase of Best Buy's \"New Blue Growth\" plan was initiated in 2017 by former Chief Executive Hubert Joly, who stepped down in April.\n\nShares of the company, which have gained 27% so far this year, were flat in afternoon trading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Sriraj Kalluvila)", "description": "The company has zeroed in on healthcare technology as a key driver in the second phase of its growth plan and has made a series of purchases such as GreatCall in August 2018 for $800 million to build out the business.
