There is treasure on the island \u2013 \u00a3100,000 in crates of \u00a310 notes randomly dropped by helicopter onto a deserted south pacific atoll \u2013 but the \u201cwonga\u201d, as the participants call it, is entirely incidental to the real defining feature of the series: human greed. So \u201cGreed Island\u201d would be rather more apt.\n\nAs for The Bear himself, we find him stomping around a bit at the beginning to warn the 12 \u201cordinary people\u201d marooned on the island about the man-eating sharks and poisonous frogs around the place. Or that might have been man-eating frogs and poisonous sharks; same difference, I guess, if you end up arguing with one. After that, though, Bear clears off, maybe to check into a luxury hotel, maybe to camp out with the frogs, maybe to barbecue a marine iguana. Who cares?\n\nWe are then left instead to consume the sweaty footage gathered from bodycams and a team of six camerapersons stationed on the island to follow the action. The monochrome scenes shot with night-vision have an eerie texture to them, adding a bit of Most Haunted to a show that is basically a cross between I\u2019m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! and Radio 4\u2019s The Moral Maze. If you can\u2019t stand the heat and the thirst and have to get off the island, you get nothing. Otherwise you\u2019re left in the dilemma of cooperating to find and share the cash, or selfishly trying to keep it for yourself.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnyhow, less time for Bear Grylls means much more time for the most entertaining of the various punters selected \u2013 Lord Mountbatten. This isn\u2019t, of course, the original Lord \u201cDickie\u201d Mountbatten, hero of the Second World War, last viceroy of India, murdered by Irish terrorists and whose personal predilections gave rise to the nickname \u201cMountbottom\u201d. This, rather, is the 56-year old Ivar, whose occupation is given as \u201cLord and Estate Owner\u201d. But he is much, much more than that, an endlessly intriguing character.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families.

Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 27/30 Chernobyl HBO 28/30 The Handmaid's Tale Hulu 29/30 This Way Up Aisling Bea and Sharon Horgan in Channel 4 series 'This Way Up' Channel 4 30/30 Succession Brian Cox leads the Roy family in HBO knockout \u2018Succession\u2019 HBO 1/30 Doctor Who - New Year's Day special (BBC1) \u201cAs a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who \u2013 i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks \u2013 this is a New Year treat that more than delivers\u201d BBC 2/30 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2) \u201cBilly Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity \u2013 a \u201cProustian wander through Scotland\u201d.

This, though, does seem at odds with the biographical video we see, where we find him roaming around his pristine grounds and enjoying a nice bibulous lunch with friends and family in the well-appointed kitchen of his Georgian mansion. When he eventually gets his hands on the first \u00a37,500 he discovers, he delightedly squeals that it will \u201cpay my daughter\u2019s school fees\u201d. For a term, that is. So, in a way, it is no wonder money is always a problem in the Mountbatten household.\n\nMountbatten is also morally challenged. Initially, in front of his fellow greed islanders, he puts his patrician case for sharing the loot. You see, the programme makers have been quite skilful in constructing a \u201cmixed ability\u201d class of individuals, ranging from 20-year-old northern waitress Ruby through a brain surgeon to a cockney builder (Jim, 52), all the way to the oldest, Irene, a retired florist aged 75. Taking the cue, Mountbatten and a couple of others suggest looking after the weakest in their mini-society \u2013 those like poor old Irene or Cat, the nurse with a dodgy knee, who\u2019d be lucky to get off the island alive, let alone loaded with treasure.\n\nSo it is an experimental test of human nature, or of socialism in action you might say. The well-spoken Mountbatten looks and sounds every inch the aristocratic gent, a man with a sense of One Nation, of noblesse oblige. To some, he embodies \u201ca new level of poshdom\u201d, in the awed words of Morag, an earthy 58-year old \u201cproperty manager\u201d who seems oddly anxious to stress she only ever charges her tenants a \u201cfair rent\u201d.\n\nAnd yet\u2026 when the informal leader of the group, a 30-year old former marine named Marco teams up with Ivar Mountbatten and the pair stumble across not one but two loads of loot, they quickly decide to help themselves to it, and keep their finds secret from the rest. They weave a tall story about a futile search for a freshwater supply, and tell ever more elaborate fibs to their, for now, unsuspecting mates. \u201cI feel a bit of a s***,\u201d admits Mountbatten, privately to us, which at least suggests some self-awareness. I formed the impression that when his lordship wrestles with his conscience, he usually wins.\n\nMarco, however, starts talking about his greed in a strange accent, like a Bond villain, suddenly possessed by the most base of human instructs. Which he had.\n\nMarco and Mountbatten also had more than a selfish desire for bundles of tenners in common. Marco mentions that his mum is \u201cmarried to a chick\u201d, at which point Mountbatten lets Marco into his own \u201clittle secret\u201d \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m married to a bloke.\u201d \u201cEverybody loves a gaylord,\u201d Mountbatten laughingly declares, which is obviously true, or at least true until they find out that you\u2019re quite a deceitful gaylord and you\u2019ve got \u00a315,500 secretly stashed away. Then you\u2019ll be liable to get a smacked Mountbottom.\n\nTreasure Island with Bear Grylls continues on Channel 4, every Sunday at 8pm", "description": "Treasure Island with Bear Grylls\u00a0is a bit of a misnomer.
