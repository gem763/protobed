They\u2019re paying off nearly $1,500 in medical bills, and his wife, a hospital scheduler, took a second job bartending several nights a week.\n\nStevens, whose family makes about $48,000 a year, looked at enrolling his daughter in Michigan\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, a subsidized government plan for working families.\n\nShawn Stevens and Courtney Stevens, whose 3-year-old daughter, Selena, has autism, pay nearly $1,500 in a month in medical bills. (Robert Gourley / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cThey told me I made too much,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m not poor enough? I feel pretty poor.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMost workers blame drug companies and health insurers for high healthcare costs, The Times/KFF survey found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut deep partisan lines also divide Americans\u2019 views of the affordability crisis.\n\nHalf of Democrats struggling with the costs of their job-based health coverage blame the Trump administration for the cost pressures.\n\nSix in 10 Republicans fault the 2010 healthcare law, often called Obamacare.\n\nThe law, for the first time, guaranteed Americans could get insurance if they\u2019re sick.\n\nIt also gave millions of very poor working Americans access to Medicaid, which does not have deductibles. The expansion produced a historic drop in the number of Americans without health insurance.\n\nBut many health plans being sold on the law\u2019s insurance marketplaces have very high deductibles, mirroring the run-up that has happened with job-based benefits.\n\nAnd although the expansion of Medicaid is broadly popular, it has highlighted the strains on U.S. workers and their families.\n\nTwo groups of workers \u2014 those with high incomes and those with low deductibles \u2014 are more likely to believe they have better coverage than Medicaid enrollees, who typically have to make less than $17,000 a year to qualify, The Times/KFF poll found.\n\nBut workers in households making less than $40,000 a year and those with the highest deductibles are more likely to say the health insurance system works better for people on Medicaid.\n\nThat includes people with deductibles of more than $3,000 for individual coverage and $5,000 for a family plan.\n\nAs deductibles and premiums have surged, a growing number of low-income workers who have job-based health benefits are enrolling their children in Medicaid and the related Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, research shows.\n\nBut many workers cannot get the same cost-free government coverage for themselves.\n\nStevens, the Home Depot worker, said he doesn\u2019t begrudge those who need government assistance, recalling that when he was a child, his family was poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. But he said he missed the security that coverage offered.\n\n\u201cThere was no fear,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to be afraid to go to the doctor.\u201d\n\nOverall, four in 10 American workers said they had trouble affording healthcare in the last year, despite having job-based health coverage, The Times/KFF survey found.\n\nThat number, however, masks a large disparity in Americans\u2019 experiences.\n\nTwo-thirds of workers in households making less than $40,000 a year said they struggled to pay for healthcare in the previous year.\n\nBy comparison, fewer than one-third of workers with incomes of at least $100,000 said they had difficulty affording care, according to the poll.\n\nThis income divide is baked into the way employers provide coverage to workers in America: Companies with better-paying jobs have long offered more generous benefits.\n\nIn 2018, for example, workers at firms with higher wages had to pick up about a quarter of the cost of a family health plan, according to an annual employer survey KFF has been conducting for years. The employer paid the remaining three-quarters.\n\nAmericans who work for low-wage employers, by comparison, had to pay nearly 40% of the cost of a family health plan.\n\nThat meant workers at firms that pay less also got hit with an average of some $1,700 more in insurance premiums than their counterparts at better-paying employers.\n\nThat pay-based disparity didn\u2019t matter as much when deductibles were lower, giving low-wage workers some protections against large medical bills if they became ill.\n\nAs recently as 2006, the average deductible for individual coverage in job-based plan was just $379, adjusted for inflation, according to KFF.\n\nBut since the early 2000s, employers have rapidly shifted costs onto workers as they\u2019ve scrambled to control their own healthcare spending.\n\nThe average deductible has more than tripled, to $1,350. More than a quarter of workers have plans with a deductible of at least $2,500.\n\nCompanies often didn\u2019t pay full attention to the extra burden on workers, said Michael Critelli, the former head of global technology firm Pitney Bowes.\n\n\u201cThe average chief executive couldn\u2019t put themselves in the shoes of a worker trading off healthcare with paying a bill to stay in a home or an apartment,\u201d Critelli said. Pitney Bowes was among a handful of large employers that tailored health benefits to make it easier and more affordable for workers to get recommended care and prescription drugs.\n\nMost top wage-earners, who already have more savings, are better positioned to adjust to higher deductibles.\n\nBut they got additional help from a change in tax law that accelerated the shift in health insurance, data show.\n\nIn 2003, President George W. Bush signed legislation allowing workers in high-deductible plans to put aside money in tax-free accounts that could be used to pay medical bills.\n\nConservative politicians and health economists touted Health Savings Accounts, or HSAs, and high deductibles as a way to give patients \u201cskin in the game\u201d and an incentive to shop for lower-priced medical care.\n\nShortly after the 2003 law was enacted, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a leading GOP booster of the accounts, predicted in a joint op-ed the law would \u201cinevitably lead to lower prices, more affordability and more consumer choices.\u201d\n\nNone of that happened.\n\nMiddle- and low-income workers, whose incomes and savings have barely budged in recent decades, hardly use HSAs, even as their deductibles have soared.\n\nFor wealthier Americans, by contrast, the accounts have become a generous savings and investment tool.\n\nIn 2013, for example, people with income greater than $100,000 accounted for less than 20% of tax filers, but 70% of total contributions made to HSAs that year, according to tax data analyzed by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nBy contrast, Americans with incomes below $40,000 made up nearly 50% of tax filers but made less than 6% of HSA contributions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that these accounts have been far more valuable to higher-income people,\u201d said Paul Fronstin, who directs the health research program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.\n\nNew research conducted by the institute in partnership with The Times shows just how much greater these advantages have been for the wealthiest workers.\n\nAnalyzing wage and insurance data from a large national corporation with an HSA plan, Fronstin and his colleagues found that employees with individual coverage who earned more than $150,000 in 2016 put more than $1,700 on average into their HSAs that year.\n\nThat was nearly three times as much as workers earning less than $75,000.\n\nBy the end of 2016, the high-income workers also had more than three times as much saved, averaging almost $6,500 in their accounts.\n\nThe higher-income employees also were nearly twice as likely to invest their accounts, a recommended strategy for maximizing the tax benefits of HSAs.\n\nRelated research by Fronstin indicates that workers with higher HSA balances use more healthcare, even accounting for differences in workers\u2019 ages.\n\n\u201cAll around, they are getting more bang for their buck,\u201d he said.\n\nBrittany Robb, 24, who recently began her first job at an architectural firm in St. Paul, Minn., said she dreams of building savings in the HSA that comes with her $2,000-deductible plan.\n\nEven with a salary of $48,500, however, Robb can afford to put only $80 in the account every month.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get me a lot,\u201d she said, noting that bills for seeing a therapist and filling prescriptions quickly deplete the HSA and force her to ration her care.\n\n\u201cI feel pretty stressed about health insurance all the time.\u201d", "description": "Middle-class Americans are bearing the brunt of the rise in health insurance deductibles and medical bills.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Noam N.
