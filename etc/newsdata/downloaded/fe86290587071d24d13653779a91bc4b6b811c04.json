Hong Kong residents were prone to wearing surgical masks in public even before the protests began.\n\n\u201cWe must stop the violence,\u201d said Lam, touting the mask ban as \u201can effective deterrent to radical behavior\u201d because the anonymity provided by masks emboldens \u201cunbridled\u201d demonstrators to become violent.\n\nMask violations could be punished with up to a year in jail and a fine of $25,000 in Hong Kong dollars. Lam invoked an emergency law dating from British colonial days that has not been used since 1967. Critics said she was going too far and illegally bypassing the legislature, not to mention taking steps more likely to inflame public anger than induce calm.\n\n\u201cThis is an ancient, colonial set of regulations, and you don\u2019t use them unless you can\u2019t legislate anymore. Once you start, there\u2019s no end to it,\u201d said activist lawyer Martin Lee.\n\nResponse to Lam\u2019s announcement was immediately and strongly negative. Hundreds of people poured onto the streets in \u201cflash mob\u201d protests, many of them apparently business people who left their offices to demonstrate. Others were students still wearing their school uniforms.\n\nLATEST: Protesters wearing masks fill the main roads of Hong Kong after the government announced a face mask ban pic.twitter.com/i2a27jnMR5 \u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) October 4, 2019\n\nMarch in Central https://t.co/rxkJIYHsJD \u2014 Joshua Wong \u9ec3\u4e4b\u92d2 (@joshuawongcf) October 4, 2019\n\nMany of the demonstrators wore masks, including the gas masks that discomfit the authorities because they shield against tear gas and pepper spray, and chanted \u201cwearing a mask is not a crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe anti-mask law has become a tool of tyranny,\u201d a student protester told Reuters. \u201cThey can make use of the emergency law to enact any policies or laws that the government wants.
