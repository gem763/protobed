From Dostoevsky to F. Scott Fitzgerald, the universally recognized writers of each nation have cultivated a style that is precisely their own, while seemingly representative of the national tenor.\n\nChinese essayist and translator Lu Xun (1881-1936), and a leading figure in the New Culture Movement of the 1920s and conversations on reform in China, surely sits amid that tradition of voice creators. His essays, including \"Medicine\u201d and \u201dKongyij\u201d and the various literary journals he helped edit and publish illuminated Chinese society through characters that everyone could recognize but no one had before seen on the page. Kong Yiji tells the story of an aging, ridiculed scholar who fails the xiucai examination and is mocked in the local bar, and implicitly criticizes the futility of an exam-based education system and human indifference. In \"An Incident\", we confront a passenger whose rickshaw collides with a pedestrian. The passenger must ask, \"When do my social obligations to others begin?\"\n\nLu Xun's style is defined by intricate symbolism and philosophical questions as they arose in quotidian life\u2014\u201chow should one act as a friend, a citizen, a partner\u201d\u2014which themselves are interwoven with often melancholic existential realities and historical commentary on China as it moved away from an imperial system and into years of reform and revolution.\n\nThese were facets of Lu Xun\u2019s voice, but perhaps the most important was that he often wrote in vernacular Chinese. For centuries, literary writing was composed in the classical style, or wenyanwen, which followed a different syntactical structure from spoken speech and held myriad references to ancient tropes and stories, making it illegible for someone without formal training.", "description": "Chinese essayist and translator Lu Xun (1881-1936), and a leading figure in the New Culture Movement of the 1920s and conversations on reform in China, surely sits amid that tradition of voice creators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201808/23/5b7e5e8ea310add1c69844ba.jpeg", "published_at": "2018-08-23"}
