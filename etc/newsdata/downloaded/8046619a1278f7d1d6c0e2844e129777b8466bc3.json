The Foundation eventually backed down and allowed Wikipedia\u2019s community-elected Arbitration Committee to review the ban, which they lifted, giving the revolt a notable victory \u2014 but Fram\u2019s adminstrator privileges were not restored.\n\nThe highly irregular case was still criticized as the Committee would not restore Fram\u2019s administrative privileges citing secret Foundation evidence and dubious \u201ccommunity\u201d evidence. An attempt by Fram to be re-elected as a Wikipedia administrator following the case failed as editors cited past conflicts with him and the Committee\u2019s refusal to restore his privileges themselves.\n\nIn banning Fram, the Foundation cited \u201charassment\u201d without giving details or identifying the complainant. Wikipedia\u2019s traditionally self-governing community revolted by overturning Foundation actions or resigning their positions. Pressured by co-founder Jimmy Wales, the Foundation conceded to the ban being reviewed by the Wikipedia community\u2019s Arbitration Committee, likened to a Supreme Court. Editors celebrated and several administrators who resigned requested their positions back.\n\nHowever, the Committee\u2019s proposed review prompted more criticism. Cases usually involve people providing evidence publicly, unless it involves personal information. In reviewing Fram\u2019s ban, the Committee announced all evidence, including a redacted Foundation dossier, would be provided privately and only summaries posted. Some accepted this as more transparent than the Foundation process, while others criticized it as insufficient.\n\nAfter several weeks, Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee have also finally announced their plans for a case on Fram to, effectively, review the Foundation's ban. They intend for it to be a private hearing with only anonymized summaries of evidence published. #WikiMassacre pic.twitter.com/eCfolfvXcw \u2014 T. D. Adler (@tdadler) July 25, 2019\n\nAggravating matters, when the Committee posted its evidence summaries, most community evidence appeared to be from a website collecting evidence against Fram. It included common errors, such as presenting Fram\u2019s summary of another administrator\u2019s insulting attitude as though Fram were insulting an editor. The Committee also stated that, while agreeing the Foundation\u2019s dossier on Fram showed clear misconduct, a summary of it could not be posted. Despite these issues, the Committee still unanimously concluded the evidence did not justify Fram\u2019s ban. In another unusual step, the Committee lifted Fram\u2019s ban before closing the case so they could focus on whether evidence was sufficient to uphold the Foundation\u2019s removal of Fram\u2019s administrative privileges.\n\nOne Committee member pushing for action regarding Fram\u2019s administrative status was Molly White, who goes by \u201cGorillaWarfare\u201d on Wikipedia. There was concern about White\u2019s involvement in the case as she had received a temporary ban from Fram the previous year after baselessly accusing another editor of \u201cmisogyny\u201d, though other editors had the ban overturned. Initially voting to uphold removal of Fram\u2019s privileges, White gradually walked back her position as editors criticized her conflict of interest or argued evidence did not even support that decision. She eventually proposed another lengthy case to decide the matter with additional evidence.\n\nWhite\u2019s suggestion for another case prolonging the debate was rejected as other Committee members favored an initial proposal she made on upholding the removal of Fram\u2019s privileges and closed the case with the removal upheld. Fram quickly sought to regain his privileges as numerous administrators agreed to co-nominate him for the position and Fram put his nomination before the Wikipedia community. Initially favoring Fram, the discussion quickly soured as other administrators with grievances from past conflicts came forward.\n\nMost influential in opposing Fram was former Arbitration Committee member Michel Aaij, who edits as \u201cDrmies\u201d on Wikipedia. The two previously fought over the Committee\u2019s decision during Aaij\u2019s tenure to lift the eight-year ban of editor Guido den Broeder, who was banned for promotional editing. Broeder was re-banned for promoting his unrecognized \u201cmicronation\u201d and an independent film he helped produce. When Aaij sought re-election to the Committee the previous year, Fram raised Broeder\u2019s case and called Broeder a \u201cpedophile\u201d in apparent reference to Broeder\u2019s edits about a child model starring in the film he co-produced. Broeder noted the child\u2019s mother denied sexualizing her child by calling pedophilia a \u201cWestern phenomena.\u201d Aaij\u2019s re-election attempt failed. However, Aaij\u2019s objection became the most cited reason for opposing Fram\u2019s own re-election as an administrator.\n\nFram\u2019s re-election was opposed by another former Committee member: Robert Fernandez, known as \u201cGamaliel\u201d on Wikipedia. Fernandez allegedly sent anonymous sexual harassment accusations against Fram to a Wikipedia newsletter, which falsely distorted events from a previous dispute. Due to these objections and others, such as that of an Antifa supporter who had publicly praised an Antifa terrorist attack against an ICE detention center on Wikipedia and claimed Fram\u2019s conduct harmed the site\u2019s image, discussion switched from majority support to majority opposition and Fram withdrew his nomination. In response to the failure of Fram\u2019s re-election effort, one administrator who nominated Fram resigned and expressed uncertainty about the \u201crules of engagement\u201d for administrators.\n\nConclusion of Fram\u2019s case has not fully resolved the dispute. A consultation on the Foundation process used against Fram has been initiated to seek future approval for similar actions and the Arbitration Committee proposed a discussion on how to handle \u201charassment\u201d cases on Wikipedia in the future. Such discussions and Fram\u2019s initial ban seek to address media criticism of the Wikipedia community\u2019s toxicity and to improve \u201cdiversity\u201d among editors, though no apparent effort to address the site\u2019s existing ideological bias is intended.\n\nT.
