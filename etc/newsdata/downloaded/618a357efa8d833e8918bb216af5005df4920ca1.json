Lightly edited with permission.\n\nPersonalizing your marketing emails increases conversion. But doing so at scale takes a lot of effort. Here\u2019s how to get around that:\n\nRun lead generation ads to your blog posts and to other long-form content on your site. Then tag users based on the posts they\u2019ve read. Plus, prompt them to fill out useful quizzes. Store their quiz answers.\n\nPush their engagement data into an automated emailing platform like Customer.io. And enrich their contact details with Clearbit to discover their job title and the industry they work in.\n\nNow you can send automated yet personalized drip emails based on a person\u2019s role, company, and interests. This results in higher conversion rates. Show recipients you know who they are and what they care about, and you\u2019ll seem a whole lot less like spam.\n\nImproving cold email response rates", "description": "We\u2019ve aggregated the world\u2019s best growth marketers into one community.
