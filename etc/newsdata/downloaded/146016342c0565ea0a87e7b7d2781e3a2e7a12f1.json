Ever since that vote, I have been campaigning for the public to have the final say in a confirmatory referendum on any Brexit deal that emerges.\n\nAt first, it was a lonely position to hold in Parliament. However, thanks to the incredible campaigning, organising, marching, tweeting and letter writing from pro-European activists, a People\u2019s Vote is now supported by all opposition parties in Parliament, as well as a growing number of Conservatives.\n\nBoris Johnson wants MPs and the public to be cornered into thinking it\u2019s his deal or no-deal at all, but that\u2019s a false choice.\n\nWhile the proposals may have been agreed with the EU it\u2019s by no means certain that it will pass in Parliament. Whatever happens, a People\u2019s Vote is the obvious way forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week I met with senior diplomats and the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit Steering Group in Brussels, as part of a delegation with a cross-party group with senior MPs from all Westminster parties except the DUP.\n\nDespite obvious fatigue after years of political turmoil resulting from the 2016 referendum, all the European politicians and diplomats I met stressed their commitment to being patient and working in the best interests of UK and EU27 citizens.\n\nThere was a shared recognition of the gravity of the situation: with jobs, trade, workers\u2019 rights, environmental, social and protections and our 28 nations\u2019 security at risk.\n\nAs Nelson Mandela said, \u2018the real makers of history are the ordinary men and women of our country\u2019.\n\nDuring those meetings it emerged that a full and final deal is very unlikely to be ratified by all sides in time for Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018do or die\u2019 31 October deadline.\n\nIf the deal is voted in down by MPs on Saturday, The Benn Act will require the government to request an extension.\n\nEuropean politicians and officials were open to the idea of either a short technical extension, or a longer extension to allow for a democratic moment to break the deadlock.\n\nWe were left in no doubt that if Parliament were to express a will to hold a new referendum, the EU would grant a suitably lengthy extension period.\n\nThe job left for us is to convince a dozen or so undecided MPs to back a People\u2019s Vote. This will not be easy, but it is achievable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know several MPs who were once opposed to another referendum but who have since changed their mind because of the number of letters and emails they received from their constituents calling on them to support giving the choice on Brexit back to the people.\n\nAs Nelson Mandela said, \u2018the real makers of history are the ordinary men and women of our country\u2019. So email your MP, write to them, meet with them, encourage them, and support them in making the right decision. That\u2019s what it means to live in a democracy.\n\nThe biggest opportunity to convince MPs to back a People\u2019s Vote will happen this Saturday. Hundreds of thousands of activists will gather for the Together for the Final Say march in Westminster.\n\nThis will be the first time Parliament has sat during a People\u2019s Vote march on this scale.\n\nIt will be an opportunity to tell all MPs what kind of country we want to be. We will march against the narrow-minded, isolationist, nostalgic version of Little England that Boris Johnson promotes.\n\nWe will rally for the open-minded, inclusive, internationalist, progressive United Kingdom we know we can be.\n\nThat is why Saturday\u2019s march is so important \u2013 it\u2019s a chance for the people to show the Brexit elite in government that they do not speak for the people. That we are the people and that, together, we must have the final say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Could Labour push Brexit deal over the line?\n\nMORE: David Cameron calls Boris Johnson a \u2018greased piglet\u2019 but backs his deal\n\nMORE: Jeremy Corbyn backs second referendum after \u2018even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s\u2019", "description": "It is now more than 1,200 days since the referendum that split our United Kingdom apart.
