Congress should stop it.", "language": "en", "text": "Perhaps all he wanted to do was plug Doral and leave it at that? Nope. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced at a Thursday news conference that the G-7 actually will be held at Doral, and he confirmed that the site was chosen at the president\u2019s suggestion. This is not a jest: It is blatant and corrupt self-dealing by the president.\n\n\u201cWe thought, of the 12 places that we looked at \u2014 and you\u2019d recognize the names of them if we told what they were \u2014 that this was by far and away the best choice,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney explained, without, in fact, revealing which other properties were considered. Each country can take its own building, he gushed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is not the first time Mr. Trump has recommended that the administration use one of his properties for official purposes \u2014 and that the property turned out to be ideal, according to Trump administration spin. Last month, Vice President Pence stayed at the president\u2019s Doonbeg resort when he visited Ireland, which required Mr. Pence to fly across the country for meetings in Dublin. The excuse then was that a scrambled itinerary meant the vice president required last-minute accommodations, and, according to Mr. Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Mr. Trump suggested Doonbeg. Miraculously \u2014 or is it inevitably? \u2014 the administration concluded that the president\u2019s property fit the bill.\n\nThe Trump crew\u2019s typical response to questions about self-dealing is to claim that the president will not profit from foreigners staying at this hotel or that resort. \u201cThey\u2019re doing this at cost,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney insisted. But selling out Doral at cost for a while might mark a welcome departure for the Trump Organization: The Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold points out that between 2016 and 2017, revenue at Doral fell 13.8 percent and net operating income declined 62 percent. Just the publicity that Doral will get, not to mention the prestige the business will claim long after hosting a major international conference, is valuable.\n\nProfit or its absence is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution\u2019s emolument clause. Instead, it simply says the president may not, without the consent of Congress, accept compensation \u201cof any kind whatever\u201d from any \u201cforeign state.\u201d If a Doral summit does not violate this stricture, then nothing does. Meantime, the notion that the United States stands for clean government in the public interest \u2014 and its standing to combat graft in other countries \u2014 is shredded.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the start of his term, Mr. Trump promised to insulate himself from the business operations from which he would continue to profit. Now he is doing just the opposite: using his office to drive millions of dollars in revenue to a faltering property that is a critical component of his company\u2019s portfolio. Will Congress really tolerate such crude corruption? It shouldn\u2019t.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "If a Doral summit does not violate the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, then nothing does.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uIl74QFIF91xpiXr6rIU2u8ODgI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ESFRNUHR24I6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
