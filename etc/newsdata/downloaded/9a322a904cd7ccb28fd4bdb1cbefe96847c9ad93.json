Yeah yeah! \u2026He invites girls and I was like, 'Wait, wait, wait, what's going on?' and he's says, 'Oh no, Dad, they are friends. Come on, we're friends,'\" said Douglas.\n\nThe two-time Academy Award-winner said despite his daughter\u2019s desire for friendship, the 75-year-old admitted that she is in fact \u201clooking for love.\u201d\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS ON BECOMING A FIRST-TIME GRANDFATHER, AGING IN HOLLYWOOD: 'I DON'T LIKE THE LACK OF STAMINA'\n\n\"She likes kind of dark, Latin types,\" he said, adding that he believes he\u2019ll absolutely be a protective father who tends to \u201cgive a lot of unsolicited advice, which is not a great idea, but I can't help myself!\"\n\nAsked what advice he had for his fledgling daughter in her quest for love, the four-time Golden Globe-winner didn\u2019t cheap out on the wisdom.\n\n\"You gotta decide at an early age if you are more concerned about the looks versus who has got a good heart, who has got a good sense of humor, who's gonna be a good partner,\" he offered. \"I don't worry too much about her. She's in good shape.\"\n\nThe \"Ant Man & Wasp\" star added a few words he said he received from his father, Kirk Douglas, as a budding star that have stayed with him for so many years.\n\nCATHERINE ZETA-JONES AND MICHAEL DOUGLAS SHARE THE SECRET TO THEIR 20-YEAR ROMANCE\n\n\"Whatever you do in life, whatever you gotta do, just do it to your utmost ability,\" the father-of-three conveyed. \"Do it with full commitment and then, screw it if it doesn't work out. Move on. But, you know, you left it with the idea that there is nothing more you could have done.\"\n\nSpeaking of commitment, Douglas didn\u2019t leave without dishing on the idea that he and his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones, 49, have shown interest in acting alongside each other again since their children are growing older. Ahead of the couple\u2019s 20-year wedding anniversary, he said their marriage is as strong as ever.\n\n\"I've learned over the years to just, you know, honor and cherish,\" he said. \"And part of that is getting older too because you have a finite amount of time left and you might as well make it as best you can. So, I try to be as considerate as I can to the person closest to me rather than waste my time with people I hardly know.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We'd love to do things together,\u201d Douglas said of his and Zeta-Jones\u2019 desire to work alongside each other again. \u201cWe did one picture years ago, 'Traffic,' although we didn't have much to do together. And I guess we haven't because we always like to have \u2026one of us was home for the kids,\" he explained. \"But now that we're pretty much empty-nesters, we might consider that.\"\n\nSeason 2 of \u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201d is slated to begin streaming on Oct. 25 on Netflix.", "description": "Michael Douglas is just like many fathers\u00a0who aren't too thrilled\u00a0the day their daughters tell them\u00a0they\u2019re interested in somebody.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/michael-douglas-catherine-zeta-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
