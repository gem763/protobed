Robyn Rihanna Fenty. Our queen. As Poison Ivy.\n\nHuge, I know.\n\nAccording to We Got This Covered, Warner Bros. Studios is eyeing off Rihanna for the iconic role in the next instalment of the Dark Knight franchise.\n\nHonestly, Rihanna as Poison Ivy is a great casting choice. And considering the last person to play Poison Ivy was the insanely talented Uma Thurman, it seems only fitting that she\u2019s replaced with someone of equal star power.\n\nIt is unclear whether RiRi has formally been offered the role, but it looks like she\u2019s at least made the cut for the list of potential Poison Ivy\u2019s.\n\nRihanna has made a few acting appearances in her time, including roles in Valerian, Ocean\u2019s 8 and, of course, Bring It On: All Or Nothing. She\u2019s definitely a singer who acts, rather than an actor who sings, but I think with the right crew behind her she could pull this off.\n\nWe also have no idea if she actually wants the role, but I feel like most people are down for the chance to play a super-villain at some point in their career, so here\u2019s hoping we get Poison RiRi soon.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/rihanna.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
