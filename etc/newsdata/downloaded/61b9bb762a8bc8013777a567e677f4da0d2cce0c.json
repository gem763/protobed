She got sucked into the common trap of \u201cyo-yo dieting\u201d \u2014 dieting, then bingeing, then dieting. It continued through her 20s.\n\nShe got sucked into the common trap of yo-yo dieting \u2014 dieting, bingeing, then dieting.\n\nToday, at 44, she\u2019s stable at a healthy weight. She says her relationship with food is completely different. And she\u2019s making bank as a healthy-eating blogger and YouTube GOOG, +0.14% star.\n\nSpies says she makes a \u201csix-figure income\u201d producing one cooking video a week from her own kitchen and from her food blog. (Others say it\u2019s extremely difficult to make such a sum on YouTube, even with a couple of million views a month.)\n\nShe has made about 650 videos, and her YouTube GOOGL, +0.17% channel, \u201cClean & Delicious,\u201d just broke one million subscribers. Her views range from 12,000 to 1.3 million per video. Her husband, Beng, taught himself videography and films the videos.\n\nShe made her first videos about 10 years ago. At the time, she was working as a personal trainer and life coach, and started making videos to help her clients. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t focus on YouTube as a \u2018business\u2019 business,\u201d Spies said.\n\nAll that changed about three years ago, when both her children were in school, she says. She and her husband began focusing more on the YouTube channel, making one video a week.\n\nSpies says she still works a normal amount of time for a middle-class mom, about 40 hours a week, but she has much more flexibility.\n\nShe also writes one item a week for her blog, and says that generates as much income as the videos. \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed what some food bloggers are making,\u201d she says. \u201cI know some food bloggers making $30,000, $40,000 a month.\u201d\n\nShe says she still works a normal amount of time for a middle-class mom, about 40 hours a week, but has much more flexibility. And, of course, she doesn\u2019t have to commute.\n\nRevenues mainly come from advertising on her YouTube channel and her blog, plus affiliate and sponsorship deals with companies for using their products on her videos. Spies says she was even paid by a jewelry company for wearing their bracelet on her channel.\n\nShe isn\u2019t alone. Google spokeswoman Kimberly Taylor says the number of YouTube channels \u201cmaking five or six figures in revenue\u201d has risen more than 40% over the past year, but it\u2019s obviously difficult for most people to reach that milestone.\n\n\u201cThe biggest shift for me happened when I was pregnant with my daughter,\u201d Spies recalls. She was 30. She stopped putting pressure on herself about her body image: \u201cI finally had permission\u201d not to be slim, she adds.\n\nIronically, lifting that pressure helped her drop the weight she\u2019d been trying to lose. Her relationship with food went \u201cfrom deprivation and restriction to nourishment.\u201d Now, she says, she focuses on nutrients instead of calories.\n\nObesity now kills more people world-wide than smoking. Being overweight raises your risk of premature death.\n\nSpies, who is 5 foot 4 inches tall, has dropped about 30 pounds from her peak weight. It\u2019s enough to make a significant gain in health. She went from significantly overweight, according to the guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to a healthy 135 pounds. That includes plenty of muscle, she adds. \u201cI do a lot of weight training.\u201d\n\nWeight remains a hot-button issue. TV commentator Bill Maher caused a stir when he targeted the U.S. obesity epidemic in a recent episode of his HBO T, -0.29% show, proposing that in order to make more progress fat-shaming \u201cneeds to make a comeback.\u201d\n\nCBS CBS, -1.28% talk-show host James Corden, who described himself as overweight, replied, \u201cThere\u2019s a common and insulting misconception that fat people are stupid and lazy, and we\u2019re not.\u201d He said he has struggled with \u201cfat-shaming\u201d his entire life.\n\nObesity now kills more people worldwide than smoking. Being overweight raises your risk of premature death from multiple causes. Obesity is also a big factor in rising health-care costs, analysts say.\n\nSpies, who has degrees or certifications in psychology and nutrition, is planning to launch digital classes next. She says her eating plan should be called \u201cThe Don\u2019t Diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cFood is supposed to be a source of pleasure and nourishment,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d She stopped trying to diet, she says, and started to look at real, fresh food.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lifelong process, she adds. \u201cI still struggle. I still eat emotionally at times.\u201d\n\nShe thinks most diets are too prescriptive and too focused on imposing a set of rules. They don\u2019t pay enough attention to the person. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave out the most important part of the puzzle, which is yourself,\u201d she says.", "description": "\u2018Clean & Delicious\u2019 producer Dani Spies just broke 1 million subscribers.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS716_pfaren_ZG_20191004154938.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
