Beijing does \u201cnot want to be involved or seen involved in the U.S. presidential elections,\u201d said Jeffrey Bader, a former special assistant to President Barack Obama for national security and a top Asia advisor.\n\nWang Yi, the Chinese government\u2019s top diplomat and foreign minister, said this repeatedly at events around the United Nations General Assembly last week.\n\n\u201cChina will never interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, and we trust that the American people are capable of sorting out their own problems,\u201d he said.\n\nChinese officials could \u201ctry to hint at a potential exchange of policy concessions for information, if the information is damaging at all,\u201d said Victor Shih, the Ho Miu Lam chair of China and Pacific Relations at University of California San Diego.\n\nHowever, it might make more sense for Beijing to withhold any potentially negative information it may have on Trump\u2019s rival \u201cin order not to increase Trump\u2019s re-election chances,\u201d Shih said. \u201cAfter all, Trump has upset U.S.-China trade more than any president since Nixon,\u201d he said.\n\nHunter traveled to China with his father, when the senior Biden was vice president, in 2013. The trip came months after Hunter became an unpaid board member of a new investment fund with a Chinese private equity manager, the New Yorker reported. Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese might be tempted to help Trump out and get a better trade deal, but I doubt they will interfere so directly in U.S. politics,\u201d agreed Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThey know the risks, which include betting on the wrong horse.\u201d\n\nMUDDYING TRADE TALKS\n\nTrump\u2019s request is also a recipe for bad trade policy, said trade experts. Officials from China and the United States will meet in Washington next week to try negotiate a truce in the trade war that\u2019s resulted in billions of dollars in tariffs and threatens to slow global economic growth.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments could be interpreted as an attempt to draw a link between trade talks and domestic politics, one person briefed on the trade talks said.\n\n\u201cMingling our own domestic politics with legitimate concerns about China\u2019s unfair trade practices is not a good avenue for getting a big deal done,\u201d the person said.\n\nOver the course of the escalating trade war, Beijing officials have rarely responded to Trump\u2019s volley of insults.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese strategy to deal with Trump has been not to get drawn into tit-for-tat verbal battles, but pursue their interests in a very determined way, which is why the U.S.-China trade talks are continuing,\u201d said Evan Medeiros, a professor at Georgetown University and former National Security Council official.\n\nTrump\u2019s public request is also probably a moot point, China experts add. Chinese officials likely already know absolutely everything there is to know about Hunter Biden\u2019s China-related activities or business dealings, thanks to Beijing\u2019s long-standing practice of surveillance.\n\nChina\u2019s Communist Party has historically monitored the activity of foreigners in the country closely, including restricting travel and visas, and sometimes communications and meetings with Chinese citizens and businesses.\n\nOne former U.S. official suggested that if Trump is serious about securing Chinese help in investigating the Bidens, he could try to entice them by promising greater U.S. cooperation in China\u2019s efforts to secure the extradition of dozens of fugitives Beijing is seeking under its \u201cSky Net\u201d anti-graft campaign.\n\nWashington has long resisted handing over the fugitives, many of them accused of bribery, corruption and embezzlement, because of questions about the impartiality of China\u2019s judicial system and the fairness of the charges.\n\nThe official said, however, that such an offer was unlikely to be enough to sway China to assist any probe targeting the Bidens.", "description": "If China were to act on U.S. President Donald Trump's surprising request on Thursday to start an investigation into Democratic rival Joe Biden and his family, it would be breaking one of its stated rules: do not meddle in another nation's internal politics.", "authors": ["Matt Spetalnick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
