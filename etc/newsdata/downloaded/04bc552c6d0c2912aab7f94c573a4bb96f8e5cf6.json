In a speech made on Thursday (Oct 24), President Xi praised blockchain as a potential breakthrough technology, highlighting its multitude of potential applications.\n\nSince the announcement, several top universities in China have reportedly begun offering courses on blockchain, while \"Blockchain\" was featured on the front page of one of China's most popular print newspapers, the People's Daily. And late today in China, the government there passed a new cryptography law, standardizing its approach to encryption and blockchain-related research.\n\nIn other (potentially good, Bitcoin-related) news, the CEO of fiat banking platform Crypto Capital was recently arrested on suspicion of money laundering, opening up the possibility that exchanges like Bitfinex might be able to retrieve any money that was locked up when Crypto Capital had its bank accounts seized.\n\nLastly, the recent addition of Bitcoin and Tron to the Opera cryptocurrency wallet, and rollout of Brave Rewards to users in 20 more countries, are almost universally seen as a boon for crypto adoption.\n\nTaken together, this week's plethora of positive updates may have acted as a catalyst for the recent market recovery.\n\nUnprecedented Market Movements\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, their erratic price movements are typically restricted to a few percentage points in either direction. These recent price movements are different.\n\nAs it stands, Bitcoin is currently hovering between $9,000 and $9,500\u2014up more than 20% in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has also seen its market dominance recover considerably, climbing from 65.5% up to over 68% today.\n\nAccording to Alex Kr\u00fcger, a well-known cryptocurrency market analyst, Bitcoin's recent surge is the fourth largest in its ten-year history and 15th largest two-day gain since November 2013.\n\nIt's not just Bitcoin that has benefited from the slurry of positive attention\u2014practically every major cryptocurrency has witnessed a dramatic recovery, with Ethereum rising by over 10% to top $180, Bitcoin Cash posting a 18% rise to reach $258, and Litecoin up over 12%, reaching $56.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Did a deluge of positive media attention jumpstart the recent cryptocurrency market recovery?
