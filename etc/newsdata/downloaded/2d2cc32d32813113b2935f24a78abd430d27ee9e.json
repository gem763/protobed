I had no control over it. It took me about three years to get off it.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Goldenvoice)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly powerful, it ruled \u00adeverything, getting high with that pipe was frightening. [You] do anything for it and I can understand why people went out and killed for it.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed the s**t out if it. Took it with me wherever I went. I thought it was the best thing going.\n\n\u201cI would take it to parties and go, \u2018Everybody try this\u2019, get [a] great big Bunsen burner out, the pipes, the works, freebase and \u00adeverything. And people would be going, \u2018You\u2019re f*****g crazy\u2019 but I would love it.\u201d\n\nRonnie made the astonishing \u00adadmission in a new documentary about his life Somebody Up There Likes Me.\n\nBut he admitted many of his pals ended up dead after living such a destructive lifestyle.\n\nRonnie added: \u201cI have seen enough people go over the top.\n\n\u201cSome of them didn\u2019t make it. It was a really horrible thing and you would learn a lesson from that.\u201d\n\nAt one point Damien Hirst took Ronnie to a rehab clinic after snooker star Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan told the artist he was concerned.\n\nAll the more astonishing as Hirst admitted a mammoth coke intake had turned him into a \u201cbabbling f*****g wreck\u201d and O\u2019Sullivan confessed to bingeing on drink and drugs until 7am when \u201cthe birds would be tweeting and I\u2019d think \u2018I\u2019m bang in trouble\u2019\u2019\u2019.\n\nSpeaking of the call from O\u2019Sullivan, Hirst revealed: \u201cHe said, \u2018Ronnie is in a real mess he needs to go to rehab.\u2019\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\n\u201cI picked him up with his son Jesse, and of course he is drinking. We went out and we went to a local pub on the way.\u201d\n\nRonnie, who has beaten lung cancer, played in The Faces with friend Sir Rod Stewart before joining the Stones in 1975.\n\nHis life of excess finally ended nine years ago and he has been sober ever since. Ronnie lives with theatre producer wife Sally, 41, and their three-year-old twin \u00addaughters Alice and Gracie.\n\nIn the film, the couple talk of his daily work to stay clean and sober.\n\nRonnie said: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult because you go through a period of dry and you go, \u2018I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve cleaned up now. I can have just one.\u2019\n\nAnd that is a big mistake because you can\u2019t just have one. I probably like things too much, which is harmless for some things like music, but harmful in ways like dope and drink.\u201d\n\nSally added: \u201cYou can\u2019t just think that it is not there. It could creep up at any point so that is a big deal for us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of how her husband stays sober, she said: \u201cClasses or rehab or AA meetings, he has his meditation books, check-in daily, how are you doing?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just drugs, it is smoking, it\u2019s drinking. We put the recovery first because everything else follows so. That makes sense for us.\u201d\n\nRonnie\u2019s bandmates also feature in the 70-minute film.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nMick Jagger, 76, revealed: \u201cWe all went through our overdoing it phase.\n\n\u201c[Ronnie] really wanted to be sober but it was very difficult to do if you\u2019ve been doing it all your life.\n\nIf I was some help I am glad.\u201dDrummer Charlie Watts, 78, said: \u201cMick never gave up on him.\u201d Keith Richards, 75, added: \u201cHe has a great immune system.\n\n\u201cIn fact he is very like me with a great pain threshold.\u201d\n\nRonnie, who started his rock career in band The Birds told how he first turned to booze as a teenager, after his \u00adchildhood sweetheart died in a car crash.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen I was about 15 my first \u00adgirlfriend Stephanie came to see The Birds in an early gig.\n\n\u201cHer and three of her lovely \u00adgirlfriends from school were wiped out in a Mini. I had to go see the tyre tracks and my friends [took me] down the pub and drowned my sorrows.\n\n(Image: David Muscroft/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\u201cI was in love, she was my first love. My dad, subtle as a flying mallet, he said, \u2018Ron, the man downstairs, \u00adsomething to do with Stephanie being killed,\u2019 and he left the room.\n\n\u201cI thought I better brace myself, and go downstairs, that\u2019s when I knew it was serious. You\u2019ve got to live with this kind of thing.\u201d\n\nIn the film, which was premiered as part of the London Film Festival last night, Ronnie speaks of the heartbreaking loss and tells how he was woken in the night by a visit from his \u00adgirlfriend\u2019s dad \u00addelivering the \u00addevastating news.\n\nDespite his battles with drugs, Ronnie said he never regrets taking them.\n\nHe added: \u201cI had some really good spiritual awakenings during my using years and although I wouldn\u2019t \u00adrecommend it as lot of it was the ritual associated with the \u00adpresentation of the different drugs, the rolling of the joint, the filling of the pipe or the \u00adchopping of the coke.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of ritual involved and that would be set against the ritual of the way the music was \u00adstructured\u2026 that gave you the feeling of invincibility, you can tackle anything.\n\nThe brandy Rod and I had before we went on with The Faces and with The Jeff Beck Group, the drink was very important.\n\n\u201cIt got rid of the butterflies and it gave you the power to go on and handle anything, tackle anything.\u201d", "description": "The Rolling Stones legend reveals in a new documentary about his life that at the height of his addiction he was taking a bunsen burner to parties to smoke cocaine", "authors": ["Halina Watts", "Image", "Getty Images For Goldenvoice", "Manchester Evening News", "Internet Unknown", "David Muscroft Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565665.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Flea-and-Damien-Hirst-Launch-Their-Spin-Bass-Guitar-At-Club-Nouveau-In-The-Arts-Club.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
