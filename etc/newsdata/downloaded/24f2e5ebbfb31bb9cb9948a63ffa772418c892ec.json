Usually they provide much needed relief but for this UK woman, that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nAccording to Metro UK, 29-year-old Sophie Mason\u2019s hot water bottle, which was filled with freshly boiled water tore open and left her with severe burn marks.\n\n\u201cIt had been raining outside so we were cold. I got my husband to fill the hot water bottle for me with water from the kettle. I always tuck it down the front of my leggings to keep it secure. When I did it split down the seam. I can\u2019t explain how it felt, I instantly felt sick,\u201d she told the publication.\n\nShe also posted pictures of her injuries on her Facebook page.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor YEARS I ignored the \u2018do not fill with boiling water\u2019 warning and this is the result of my ignorance,\u201d she wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe mother-of-four was then rushed to hospital where she underwent a three-hour operation in which skin from the back of her right thigh was used to cover her burns.\n\n\u201cThe nurses were trying to get control all the blisters that were coming up \u2013 there must have been 100 blisters on my stomach and legs,\u201d she explained.\n\nSophie also said that the accident had affected her mobility and is now urging others not to fill their hot water bottles with boiling water.\n\n\u201cListen to your husband when he says don\u2019t do it. He\u2019s been telling me for years and I\u2019ve been saying you\u2019re paranoid. I know so many people who\u2019ve said they do this. They always advise not to put boiling water inside in case this happens.\u201d\n\nHere are 3 other safety precautions by lovehotwaterbottles.com to keep in mind when using a hot water bottle:\n\n1. Do not overfill the bottle \u2013 Three quarters should be the maximum amount of water in the bottle. Overfilling can cause the bottle to burst.\n\n2. Never lie or sit on top of the hot water bottle \u2013 Weight and pressure can cause the bottle to burst.\n\n3. Tighten carefully - Never twist the body below the neck when tightening the stopper as the twisting motion adds pressure on the neck joints. Doing this may cause the bottle to split. Overtightening can cause the bottle to crack and leak.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Hot water bottles usually provide much needed relief but for this UK woman, that wasn\u2019t the case.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9455/c9ca9ef9198c4223996d9aa731c781a9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
