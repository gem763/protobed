But Amnesty International and the UN have shared concern about the detention of suspected terrorists there [File photo]\n\nThe man, who can only be identified by the initials NF, claimed he would be subject to \u2018ill treatment\u2019 if sent to Kenya.\n\nHe was caught at Heathrow in 2011 returning from the east African nation with a huge haul of terrorist material stored on an iPod.\n\nCourt papers reveal this included audio files said to be made by Al Qaeda and images of armed persons with flags associated with Al Shabaab, a linked terror group.\n\nDetectives later found more materials at his home. In 2013, NF was given a nine-month jail sentence for \u2018possessing information useful to terrorism\u2019.\n\nIn one of the first cases of its kind, he successfully argued his rights as a refugee outweighed the risk he poses to the UK in a judgment that has just been made public. The UK Border is pictured above in a stock image [File photo]\n\nThis consisted of a document entitled 39 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad, which the trial judge described as a \u2018terrorists\u2019 manual\u2019.\n\nThe Home Secretary at the time then tried to deport NF and his wife KKA, who both lodged asylum claims to stay in Britain.\n\nHome Office officials argued the couple were not entitled to humanitarian protection under the Refugee Convention because of the risk NF posed.\n\nBut despite hearing NF had accepted he had an \u2018extremist mindset\u2019, in 2016 immigration judges upheld an appeal by the Kenyan nationals.\n\nIt meant NF and KKA were allowed to remain in Britain and pursue an asylum claim.\n\nThe Home Secretary attempted to overturn that decision but a newly published judgment reveals the Government has lost.\n\nUpper Tribunal vice-president Mark Ockelton and judge Mark O\u2019Connor said the threshold for \u2018threatening international peace and security\u2019 had not been crossed.\n\nDavid Davies, MP for Monmouth, said: \u2018This goes to show how totally out of touch our courts have become... It\u2019s absolutely insane that judges and the courts are allowing this to happen.\u2019\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: \u2018We do not routinely comment on individual cases.\u2019 The spokesman would not discuss the status of NF and KKA\u2019s asylum claims.\n\nIt is not known why the couple said they would be at risk in Kenya.
