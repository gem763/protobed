Rather, they pick up stray impressions from what they see or hear on the go, which then add up to concrete ideas that may not fully comport with facts or reality.\n\nEven if media organizations go to pains to describe Trump\u2019s allegations about Biden as \u201cunsupported\u201d or \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d it may not be enough to prevent those impressions from being made \u2014 as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg argued this week.\n\n\u201cIt suggests more muddiness in the factual record than actually exists,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t making unproven charges against Biden. He is blatantly lying about him. He and his defenders are spreading a conspiracy theory that is the precise opposite of the truth.\u201d\n\nMuddying the waters is a strategy which worked for Trump in 2016 against Hillary Clinton and appears to be part of the playbook against Biden.\n\nJoshua Green, a Bloomberg Businessweek writer and author of a 2017 biography of Trump ally and former Breitbart chief Steve Bannon, wrote Wednesday how Bannon sought to get potentially damaging storylines about Clinton out of the conservative media echo chamber and into the mainstream press. And \u201cas Bannon had intended,\u201d Green wrote, \u201cthe whiff of corruption attached itself to Hillary and became a major theme of the media\u2019s coverage, poisoning her image.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Bannon promoted the findings of \u201cClinton Cash\u201d by Peter Schweizer, a Breitbart editor and president of the Government Accountability Institute, a nonprofit that\u2019s received significant backing from the right-wing Mercer family. The New York Times struck an \u201cexclusive agreement\u201d with Schweizer, resulting in a front-page story highlighting potential conflicts of interest involving the Clinton Foundation.\n\nSchweizer is now making his mark on the presidential election cycle with \u201cSecret Empires,\u201d a 2018 book that examined how \u201cthe American political class hides corruption\u201d and highlighted the business activities of Biden\u2019s son Hunter in Ukraine and China.\n\n\u201cAs with \u2018Clinton Cash,\u2019 Schweizer didn\u2019t allege in his book on the Bidens that any laws were broken,\u201d Green writes. \u201cInstead, his reporting laid out a suggestive timeline that led readers to the inescapable conclusion that what had transpired reeked of influence-peddling and moral, if not legal, corruption \u2014 the sort of self-dealing voters despise.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fair to question Hunter Biden taking a high-paying directorship at Burisma Holdings in Ukraine, or conducting other international business, while his father was vice president, as journalists did several years ago. Former New York Times reporter James Risen wrote in 2015 how the son\u2019s business relationships could undermine his father\u2019s \u201canticorruption message\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nBut Risen didn\u2019t accuse Joe Biden of impropriety, as is now being alleged. Risen last week wrote that Trump, his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and allies of having \u201ctwisted, perverted, and turned\u201d his journalism into \u201clies and poisonous propaganda.\u201d\n\nTrump and Giuliani have mentioned China in connection to the Bidens several times in recent weeks, though the story hasn\u2019t gotten significant traction beyond conservative media ecosystem, which includes Fox News opinion hosts.\n\nThe Daily Beast\u2019s Lachlan Markay and Asawin Suebsaeng wrote on Sept. 26 how Bannon, Schweizer and others were trying to \u201copen a new front\u201d around the China allegations, though \u201ctheir efforts have come as almost all of the national political attention is focused\u201d around Ukraine.\n\nIn \u201cSecret Empires,\u201d Schweizer looked at Hunter Biden\u2019s role in investment fund BHR Partners, which struck a deal with the Chinese government-owned Bank of China shortly after Hunter Biden and his daughter accompanied Joe Biden on a 2013 trip to meet President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn a July profile in The New Yorker, Hunter Biden acknowledged meeting with a BHR representative, though dismissed it as a social call. \u201cHow do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?\u201d he said.\n\nThe New Yorker also noted that Hunter Biden \u201cbecame an unpaid member of BHR\u2019s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House.\u201d\n\nSuch nuance was missing from Trump\u2019s unfounded claim that \u201cwhat happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine\u201d \u2014 a line that immediately became part of the Fox News chyron: \u201cTrump: China Should Investigate Bidens, What Happened There Just About As Bad As What Happened In Ukraine.\"\n\nNonetheless, that was only a little more amped up than what viewers saw on liberal MSNBC: \"Trump Calls For Ukraine, China To Investigate.\u201d\n\nAnd while news organizations continued to work the story throughout the day, focusing mainly on Trump, Biden felt obliged to issue a stinging defense of his family, thereby shifting at least some of the spotlight to him, which is probably what Trump sought to provoke in the first place.\n\nTrump\u2019s strategy, concluded journalist and author Michael Weiss on Twitter Thursday, was to sell \u201cdebunked lies to the base\u201d and force \u201cthe media to keep mentioning and re-litigating Biden/Burisma (and now China) while denouncing the media as enemy agents.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/07/f3/2e6c9ad54b1aba831b4cc60f9d7d/191003-trump-getty-773.jpg"}
