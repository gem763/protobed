(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) executives on Tuesday said the company\u2019s HBO Max streaming video service will cost $15 per month \u2014 the same price it currently charges for HBO \u2014 when it launches in May 2020, marking an aggressive entry into the streaming wars.\n\nThe logo for WarnerMedia's new HBO Max service is seen in this handout photo obtained on October 25, 2019. WarnerMedia/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nThe announcement of the price drew woo\u2019s from the audience of financial analysts and investors attending the WarnerMedia presentation on Tuesday.\n\nHBO Max is expected to reach 75 million to 90 million global subscribers by 2025, with about 50 million of these coming from the United States.\n\nThe stakes are high for AT&T, which is saddled with debt from a $134 billion acquisition spree to combine media conglomerate Time Warner and satellite TV provider DirecTV with the second-largest U.S. wireless phone company by subscribers.\n\nThe success of HBO Max is in many ways a referendum on a strategy to merge content with the means to distribute it.\n\nTo make it work, AT&T has committed to invest between $1.5 billion to $2 billion in HBO Max content next year and an additional $1 billion in 2021 and 2022, executives said this week after reporting tepid media results for the third quarter.\n\nThe investment falls far short of its biggest rival Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), which has earmarked $15 billion in cash on content spending in 2019. But AT&T and WarnerMedia executives intend to play up why they believe they deserve a seat at a table that also includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O).\n\nWarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey, who was recently elevated to the role of chief operating officer of all of AT&T in a sign of just how critical the performance of HBO Max is to the company took the stage to discuss how the company\u2019s portfolio of businesses in programming, communications, distribution and marketing contributed to the making of HBO Max.\n\nThis month Stankey told Reuters that HBO Max will be available this spring to 10 million current AT&T customers in the United States \u2014 a mix of wireless, satellite TV, and some HBO Now subscribers \u2014 at no extra charge.\n\nNOT WALMART\n\nFrom Stage 21 on the Warner Brothers Studio lot in Burbank, California, executives demonstrated the breadth of new original programming and the depth of WarnerMedia\u2019s extensive library of films and TV series. They included the entire collection of DC Universe superhero film franchises from the last decade such as \u201cBatman\u201d and recent box office hits such as \u201cJoker\u201d that will be available within the first year of its launch. WarnerMedia also secured the U.S. streaming rights to \u201cSouth Park.\u201d\n\nTo court new viewers, WarnerMedia executives said they will introduce 88 original series in 2021, 38 from HBO and 50 under the category it called \u201cMax Originals\u201d that will target younger audiences.\n\nExecutives announced a batch of new shows from high-profile producers and directors including \u201cRaised by Wolves\u201d by \u201cAlien\u201d filmmaker Ridley Scott about androids raising human children and \u201cCollege Girls\u201d from comedian, actress and writer Mindy Kaling.\n\nAhead of the presentation, HBO canceled a much-anticipated prequel to the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d starring Naomi Watts, one source familiar with the matter said, confirming reports in Hollywood media. WarnerMedia executives are expected to make new announcements about \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d during the presentation, the source said.\n\nAlthough the Warner Brothers library includes popular content like \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d \u2014 and the HBO brand is known for edgy, high-quality programming \u2014 it does not have the same brand awareness as Pixar, Marvel or Disney properties that will be included in the Disney+ streaming service that is launching on Nov. 12.\n\nAnd as one of the latest entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max will be competing for household dollars that may have already been allocated to rivals.\n\nWarnerMedia is hoping that with HBO Max, it can continue serving HBO\u2019s core over-40 audience, and expand to include younger viewers who may prefer to stream content and do not want to pay for cable.\n\n\u201cThis is a product that\u2019s going to be very different from anything else that you\u2019ve seen in the market so far,\u201d AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Monday. \u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is HBO Max.\u201d", "description": "AT&T Inc executives on Tuesday said the company's HBO Max streaming video service will cost $15 per month -- the same price it currently charges for HBO -- when it launches in May 2020, marking an aggressive entry into the streaming wars.", "authors": ["Helen Coster", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446325076&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0SC", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
