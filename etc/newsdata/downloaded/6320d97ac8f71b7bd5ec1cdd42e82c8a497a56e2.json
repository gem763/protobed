Jessica Hromas\n\nStreet Talk understands ARA sent a letter to Cromwell to request a board seat ahead of the company's annual general meeting and nominated Gary Weiss as its representative.\n\nARA argues Weiss is well-placed to represent its interests. He is a director of Straits Trading Company, which is a major ARA shareholder, and is an experienced property sector director with close to 10 years on Westfield Corporation's board among many other roles.\n\nImportantly, it argues Weiss is not an ARA executive or director, which may help overcome some of the issues Cromwell felt it had when ARA's local boss David Blight was sitting around its boardroom table.", "description": "Cromwell Property Group's biggest shareholder ARA Real Estate would like a seat around the Australian property investor's boardroom table.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_62/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f9492892d684e9213d429fbece63b41bc6ee06d1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
