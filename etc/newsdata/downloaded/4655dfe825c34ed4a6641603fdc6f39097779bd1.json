Some readers may find this content distressing or triggering.\n\nAustralian musician Zheani Sparkes is leading the sexual assault accusations against Die Antwoord after allegedly being raped by Watkin Tudor Jones in 2013, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThe 26-year-old from Brisbane has filed a police report in Queensland, claiming that Watkin Tudor Jones (Ninja) sexually assaulted her in South Africa, and committed revenge porn offences against her.\n\nShe also alleges that the frontman groomed her before \u201ctrafficking\u201d her to South Africa, amongst other claims of ritualistic torture and intimidation, according to Music Feeds.\n\nSince Zheani\u2019s allegations surfaced, an Italian musician has come forward with similar allegations dating back to 2014. \u2018Ninja\u2019 has denied the allegations from both Zheani and the other accuser.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the rap-rave duo from South Africa have come under fire for their allegedly questionable actions. Watkin Tudor Jones and band mate and ex-girlfriend Yolandi Visser were kicked off a number of recent festival lineups after footage of them allegedly being racist and homophobic surfaced.\n\nThe allegations from Sparkes began in June 2013 when Yolandi Visser commented on the then 19-year-old fan\u2019s Instagram.\n\nSparkes then allegedly communicated with the pair over email on numerous occasions.\n\nShe describes the attention from the pair as \u201coverwhelming\u201d, with at least half a dozen emails from Jones within a 24 hour period.\n\n\u201cHe referred to Yolandi as his little sister, basically disassociated their relationship,\u201d Sparkes said of Visser. \u201cWithin the next couple of days, correspondence became more intense. I was receiving up to six emails from him per day and I would reply twice. I was quite overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nSparkes also claims that she received unsolicited nudes from Watkin Tudor Jones, which she alleges is an abuse of his power over a fan.\n\n\u201cThere was this power imbalance. It all seemed too surreal to grasp what was happening so I was very much in the moment and trying to come off like a cool person.\u201d\n\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t the worst of the allegations. Sparkes recalls their phone conversations becoming more personal and regular before Jones allegedly started making more romantic moves towards her.\n\nAccording to the Sydney Morning Herald, the situation then escalated again when Sparkes had her drink allegedly spiked, which prompted Jones to organise for her to travel to Africa while she was under the influence. She refers to this incident as being \u201ctrafficked\u201d by the duo.\n\nThe allegations climax when Sparkes was in Africa visiting Jones, when she accuses him of raping her among other allegations.\n\n\u201cI was just in shock. I wouldn\u2019t discuss it,\u201d she said. \u201cI might be young, naive, dumb, but I knew what had just happened but I didn\u2019t know how to address it and I didn\u2019t feel safe to address it.\u201d\n\nIn her song \u2018The Question\u2019, Zheani details her allegations with a DIY music video with screenshots and \u201creceipts\u201d of the alleged assaults that she uploaded to YouTube in March.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was to move on with my life and leave their shit behind,\u201d the clip\u2019s description reads. \u201cI wanted to draw the line and finally speak the truth and stand up for myself. I can see through you people and I am no longer afraid of you.\u201d\n\nSparkes also alleges that Jones and his bandmate Yolandi Visser are complicit in sharing revenge porn of her, which is a crime under Australian law.\n\nWatkin Tudor Jones\u2019 publicist has released a statement denying Sparkes\u2019 allegations against him.", "description": "Australian musician Zheani Sparkes has filed a police report against Die Antwoord frontman Watkin Tudor Jones for alleged sexual assault.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/pjimage-28.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
