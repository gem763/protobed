Job creation, stock market growth, low unemployment rates, regulatory rollbacks, high approval rating among Republicans \u2014 all pretty obvious content. Trump himself posted the video on Twitter, with the comment \u201cThank you for your support as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\n\nBut toward the end of the video, the video uses a symbol of a lion\u2019s head, which, as writer Dustin Giebel and former Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski first noted on Twitter, was also used by the far-right publication VDARE.\n\nthe image at the end of the video Trump tweeted earlier was popular amongst the fascists of Lion Guard and the white supremacists of Vdare in 2016 pic.twitter.com/XBCWoRblvp \u2014 Dusty (@DustinGiebel) August 28, 2019\n\nVDARE, which describes itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Immigration Voice,\u201d was founded by white nationalist Peter Brimelow and has regularly published the work of prominent far-right extremists, including Jared Taylor, a well-known figure in white nationalism for decades. Jason Kessler, who organized the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was also a contributor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo further illustrate the flavor of the site, on Tuesday and Wednesday VDARE published three stories: one by Anne Coulter on the danger of \u201cdrunk driving illegal aliens;\u201d one by hardline anti-immigrant activist Michelle Malkin; and one proclaiming that the U.S. was teetering on the edge of becoming a third-world country partly because of the recent attempted-assault conviction of two Proud Boys.\n\nAs Mediaite noted, the lion logo has been used by other far-right groups before VDARE. In 2016, a group called the \u201cLion Guard,\u201d which described itself as an \u201cinformal civilian group dedicated to the safety and security of #Trump supports by exposing Far-Left infiltrators and saboteurs.\u201d The group\u2019s website, which doesn\u2019t appear to have been updated since 2016, also features the lion as well as the quote from Italian dictator Benito Mussolini that it is \u201cBetter to be a lion for a day, than a lamb for eternity.\u201d\n\nTrump, of course, has a long and sordid history of amplifying far-right talking points, conspiracies, and prominent personalities. Aside from his outright racism, like saying members of the \u201cSquad\u201d of four congresswomen should to go back to the corrupt countries they \u201ccame from\u201d \u2014 though three are American born and all are U.S. citizens \u2014 Trump has also tweeted about the South African \u201cwhite genocide,\u201d which is a favorite conspiracy trope of white nationalists.\n\nTrump has also retweeted Katie Hopkins, a British far-right columnist, who once called migrants \u201ccockroaches\u201d and who tweeted in the wake of terror attacks in the U.K. in 2017 that a \u201cfinal solution\u201d was needed. In 2017, Trump also retweeted a video by the fringe, ultranationalist group Britain First, a-now defunct party whose deputy leader has been convicted of hate speech in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn fact, according to an August 2019 analysis from the Daily Beast, of the 178 unverified users that Trump has retweeted, nearly 10% have been suspended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis post has been updated to clarify that the Trump campaign did not produce the video in question. It was produced by the Twitter account @som3thingwicked and was tweeted out by the president from his personal Twitter account.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-1001.png?w=1284&h=696&crop=1"}
