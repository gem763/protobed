As many as one in four babies are gaining too much weight in their first 18 months of life, due to overfeeding,\u201d the report warns.\n\nPrioritising children\u2019s health will help the NHS and tackle the rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes, Dame Sally says.\n\nShe also says children\u2019s health and rights must be prioritised when the UK makes trade deals in future. \u201cTheir health and a healthy environment must come above company profits,\u201d the report states.\n\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: \u201cA blanket cap on calories for all portions of food and drink consumed out-of-home sounds like a knee-jerk, impractical and unfair measure.\n\n\u201cWe are supportive of measures to tackle childhood obesity, but a cap on all portions clearly removes choice for all customers irrespective of age.\n\n\u201cSuch a cap would cause problems for businesses, not to mention the obvious reduction in choice for customers and restricting of personal freedoms for adults.\u201d\n\nMany businesses may struggle to prepare by changing or reformulating their menus, she warned.\n\n\u201cLots of pubs, restaurants and hotels offer traditional favourites, like fish and chips, while coffee shops often offer a fantastic range of cakes, biscuits or brownies. If they are suddenly no longer able to sell them, or have to significantly change them because of an arbitrary calorie cap, it will clearly be a challenge and put them at a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cMargins are tight and shrinking for most hospitality businesses, with ever-increasing costs. The last thing they need is another tax hike, particularly at a time of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cHigh streets across Britain are struggling \u2013 they don\u2019t need extra taxes.\n\n\u201cSome businesses would have no choice but to pass the extra cost on to customers or reduce menu options. Either way, customers and businesses would suffer.\u201d\n\nKate Halliwell, of the Food and Drink Federation, said manufacturers were already working hard on measures asked of them in the past three years and should not face punitive steps.\n\n\u201cAs Public Health England acknowledges, reformulating products takes time, and we must always take the consumer with us.\n\n\u201cWe agree more needs to be done to tackle obesity, and welcome the report\u2019s clear steer that everyone needs to play their part, including schools, local councils and the NHS.\n\n\u201cManufacturers alone will not solve this.\u201d\n\nNeil Middleton, of the Association of Public Transport Users, said drinking water to reduce dehydration and fainting risks should be encouraged, not banned.\n\n\u201cIt strikes me that practically, this is largely unenforceable ... and it seems to me that threats to passengers such as terrorism and violent crime (including rape) are a more important target,\u201d he said.\n\nRichard Pill, of the English Regional Transport Association, said there was a balance to be struck between the need for food and problems caused such as smells and the need for toilets.\n\n\u201cI am diabetic type 2 and sometimes need to eat when travelling on public transport bus, train or boat,\u201d he said.\n\nDame Sally, who stepped down as chief medical officer for England and chief medical adviser to the UK government last week, had been asked by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to examine the possibility of taxing all unhealthy foods.\n\nThe sugar tax, introduced last year, has led to a 21.6 per cent drop in the total sugar content of soft drinks between 2015 and 2018.\n\nDesigning the built environment to create opportunities for children to be active is also part of the approach advocated by Dame Sally.\n\nThe Rail Delivery Group, the Campaign for Better Transport, the Confederation of Passenger Transport and Transport Focus, representing passengers, all refused to comment on the proposed ban on food and drink.\n\nMr Hancock said the government would study the report closely and act on the evidence.", "description": "Eating and drinking on public transport should be banned to help cut childhood obesity, the UK\u2019s outgoing chief medical adviser has said.
