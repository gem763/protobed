That is why I am proud to support Joe Biden for President, and know he represents our best chance to take back the White House. His appeal to blue collar Americans in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin could be the key to victory.\n\nDemocrats struggle when we let ourselves be defined by coastal progressives, who too often forget about those people struggling with the impacts of globalization and the widening education and cultural gaps between urban and rural Americans.\n\nWhich is why it is critical that Democrats endorse policies which put people back to work \u2013 even in sectors like oil and gas. If Democrats just support progressive ideals, without really considering the impacts on people\u2019s lives, we are going to continue to struggle on the national stage. In reality, the key to winning over politically moderate voters is demonstrating to them you sincerely care about their wellbeing.\n\nThis is why I am supportive of a new proposal from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to update how it implements a law that currently forces electric utilities to buy renewable power at inflated costs, and then pass those added charges onto their customers, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet.\n\nPlease understand, I am not against renewable energy and support government programs that promote energy independence and clean power. For instance, I have long been in favor of using biofuels that support American farmers, create cleaner burning fuels, and don\u2019t raise the cost of a gallon of gasoline. Likewise, I would be supportive of federal energy policies that required electric utilities to use more clean energy, as long as those policies did not result in customers having to overpay for that electricity.\n\nBut what FERC is looking at, called Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), is a law that mandates utilities in certain states to buy renewable energy from companies at artificially high rates. The result is that these clean energy providers charge the utilities above market rates.\n\nSince utilities automatically pass the cost of acquiring energy onto its customers in the form of higher electricity bills, mandates to pay above market rates push unnecessary costs onto consumers. Additionally, at times, PURPA mandates that utilities buy energy they don\u2019t need. How does that make sense?\n\nAnother flaw of PURPA is that it locks utilities into contracts as long as 20 years. This prevents utilities \u2013 and hence their customers \u2013 from benefitting from advances in renewable technology and falling prices that come with innovations in science and transmission. When renewables cost less to produce, FERC must ensure the cost savings are passed onto utilities and ratepayers.\n\nSome people remain supportive of PURPA because they believe it forces the utilities to buy and sell wind and solar energy. And many other people are being misled by California-based developers and other businesses that are profiting handsomely off of PURPA to believe that without the 40-year-old policies, the utilities would forgo using renewables and just keep selling dirty power with no regard for the environment. If that were the case, I would not be for modernizing PURPA.\n\nBut the reality is, in places where PURPA is not imposed \u2013 states with deregulated energy markets that are designed to increase competition between energy providers \u2013 utilities are still using record amounts of energy from natural gas, wind, and solar.\n\nOn the flip side, consider the state of North Carolina, where due to PURPA it is estimated that ratepayers there will pay more than $1 billion dollars in above market energy prices over the next decade.\n\nI hope Democrats won\u2019t oppose PURPA reform, because doing so will just open us up to criticisms that we support higher electric bills. That is pretty unpopular, and no way to win elections in the politically moderate congressional districts we need to keep the House of Representatives and take back the White House in 2020.\n\nWorse, opposing PURPA reform won\u2019t even ensure utilities use more clean energy. It would just perpetuate the false narrative that Democrats don\u2019t care about average Americans, whose electrics bills are one of the biggest costs they face each month. We all should be in favor of policies that keep energy prices low, especially if it helps us avoid creating an issue that would just help to reelect Donald Trump.\n\nRonnie Shows represented Mississippi\u2019s 4th Congressional District from 1999 to 2003.", "description": "As a Democrat from Mississippi, I have long believed our party must appeal to working folks, not just wealthy people living on the east and west coasts.
