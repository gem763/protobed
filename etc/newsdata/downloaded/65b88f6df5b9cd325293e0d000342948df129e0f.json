The timing means that prime minister\u2019s questions are likely to be cancelled for the next two weeks; the next PMQs would not then be due until 23 October, after the crucial European council summit on 17 October.\n\nOn Wednesday night Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit select committee, had urged Johnson to make a statement to the Commons.\n\nHilary Benn (@hilarybennmp) The Prime Minister must make a statement to the House of Commons tomorrow on his Brexit proposals.\n\nJohnson has said he wants to get a deal in place for the EU summit so that the UK can leave with an agreement in time to meet 31 October Brexit deadline. So far European leaders have reacted with dismay to his plan to resolve the issue of the Irish backstop, which Johnson set out in a letter to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Wednesday.\n\nIn a phone call, Juncker told the prime minister that there remained \u201cproblematic points\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Barclay has hinted that the government could look to one of the EU27 to veto extending the Brexit deadline if the government is forced to seek an extension under Benn act.\n\nAsked by ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain how an extension could be avoided if no new deal was agreed, Barclay said: \u201cThere\u2019s a number of scenarios but one is [that] it requires the consent of all EU27 member states.\u201d\n\nAsked if he was suggesting that a member state could be persuaded to veto any extension, Barclay said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on is getting a deal. I think most people recognise a deal is the best way forward. What the EU themselves have said is they see that these are serious proposals. This is a way of the UK getting Brexit done leaving on 31 October, enabling parliament and the country to move forward with certainty.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Sky News, Barclay ruled out even a short extension. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want an extension and we do believe there is enough time. I think your viewers would would accept that one thing parliament hasn\u2019t been short of is time over the last three years debating Brexit. Many of these issues have been debated time and time again in parliament. So let\u2019s get Brexit done.\u201d", "description": "Speech could be last chance MPs get to challenge PM before crucial EU summit", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86038ea58a4a4c60325238995a950064e93e06fd/0_176_5278_3167/master/5278.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6c590a146a5dd226896c9cb53c866d9"}
