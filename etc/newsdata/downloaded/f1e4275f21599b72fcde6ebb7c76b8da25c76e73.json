(Bob Peyton, US Fish and Wildlife Service via AP)\n\nThe oldest known wild bird in the world has become a mother again at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, US wildlife officials said.\n\nThe Laysan albatross named Wisdom hatched a chick earlier this month at the remote atoll northwest of Hawaii, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported on Monday.\n\nWisdom is at least 68 years old and has raised at least 31 chicks, US Fish and Wildlife Service officials said. Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956.\n\nWisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, have been returning to the atoll to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year.\n\n\"She's incredibly powerful as a symbol of why we do what we do and why people all over the world pay attention to her,\" said Beth Flint, a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist. \"Wisdom is rewriting history about our understanding of survivorship, how long birds live, and how often they breed.\"\n\nAlbatross parents take turn incubating an egg for about seven months. Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They spend most of their lives flying over the ocean \u2013 feeding on squid and fish eggs.\n\nMidway Atoll is home to about 3 million seabirds, including about 1 million albatrosses.\n\nThey return to the places of their birth to nest and raise their young, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\"Midway Atoll's habitat doesn't just contain millions of birds, it contains countless generations and families of albatrosses,\" said Kelly Goodale, biologist at the refuge. \"If you can imagine when Wisdom returns home she is likely surrounded by what were once her chicks and potentially their chicks.\"\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "The oldest known wild bird in the world has become a mother again at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, US wildlife officials said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8512/9a9003e43105448d8c5e7d43625bb043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-15"}
