Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nThe Stena Impero was seized by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz waterway for alleged marine violations two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar. The Iranian ship was released in August.\n\n\u201cThe ship is on the move,\u201d Erik Hanell, the chief executive of Sweden\u2019s Stena Bulk, the ship\u2019s owner, told Reuters.\n\nHe said the company had a well-prepared security plan for the vessel once it left Iranian waters, adding that it was expected to reach international waters at about 1000 GMT.\n\nThe seizure of the ship on July 19 ratcheted up tension in the region after attacks in May and June on other merchant vessels in Gulf waters, which the United States blamed on Iran, a charge Tehran denied.\n\nStena Bulk said the Stena Impero was heading to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, on the opposite side of the Gulf, where the crew would receive medical checks and a debriefing.\n\nIran released seven of the ship\u2019s 23 crew earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe families of crew members have been informed and the company is currently making arrangements for the repatriation of its valued seafarers at the earliest possible opportunity,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nRefinitiv tracking data showed the vessel was heading for Dubai\u2019s Port Rashid, about 250 km (155 miles) from Bandar Abbas. At normal tanker speed, it would arrive within half a day.\n\nThe Ports and Maritime Organization of Iran in Hormozgan Province said in a statement the ship had moved from Bandar Abbas at 9 a.m. Iran time (0530 GMT).\n\nIt said the judicial file on the vessel remained open and the process of looking into \u201cviolations\u201d by the ship was ongoing.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry had said on Wednesday that the detention order had been lifted but the investigation continued.\n\nStena Bulk said on Wednesday it was not in negotiations with Iran and said it was not aware of any formal charges against the crew or the company.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have become more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact to rein in Tehran\u2019s nuclear program and imposed sanctions on the country aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.", "description": "The British-flagged Stena Impero tanker left Iran's Bandar Abbas port on Friday and was heading for Dubai so the crew could be repatriated, the owner said, after the ship was detained in July by Iranian forces during a row with Britain.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434391422&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q099", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
