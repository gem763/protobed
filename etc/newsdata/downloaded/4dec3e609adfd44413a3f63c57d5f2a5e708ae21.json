The Hollywood Reporter noted that it will be Trump\u2019s first trip to Hollywood since making some pointed remarks about the entertainment industry on the heels of recent mass shootings.\n\n\u201cHollywood is really terrible,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou talk about \u2018racist.\u2019 Hollywood is racist. What they\u2019re doing, with the kind of movies they\u2019re putting out, it\u2019s actually very dangerous for our country. What Hollywood is doing is a tremendous disservice to our country.\u201d\n\nActor Eric McCormack responded to the article by calling for names to be published of everyone in attendance. He wants to \u201cbe clear about who he doesn\u2019t want to work with\u201d, you see.\n\nHey, @THR, kindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with. Thx. https://t.co/7W3xPG3bI2 \u2014 Eric McCormack (@EricMcCormack) August 30, 2019\n\nMcCormack, born and raised in Canada, was quickly reminded about the freedoms enjoyed by Americans. (He holds joint Canadian and U.S. citizenship.) Lists in Hollywood based on political differences bring up memories of the Cold War and McCarthy\u2019s pursuance of Communists in Hollywood. Isaiah Washington, former cast member on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, tweeted with a question to the CEO of Twitter \u2013 Is McCormack\u2019s tweet good for society?\n\nHey @jack is this tweet openly threatening to \u201cblacklist\u201d American Citizens in Hollywood okay for the good of society? Just asking for a friend. \ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/nsy3OhQljP \u2014 Isaiah Washington (@IWashington) August 30, 2019\n\nThe actor was criticized for sounding like a fascist, too.\n\nHow wonderfully fascist of you @EricMcCormack ! Yes, how dare anyone in a FREE COUNTRY actually be FREE to support someone that you don\u2019t or have an opinion that differs from yours. Anyone that doesn\u2019t get in line with your opinion should absolutely be blacklisted from work. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \u2014 Maeve Quinlan (@maevequinlan) August 31, 2019\n\nIt isn\u2019t surprising that McCormack tweeted such nonsense. His membership in #TheResistance is well-known. He\u2019s best known for his role in NBC\u2019s Will and Grace from 1998 to 2006. In 2016, NBC brought the show back with the specific intent to criticize President Trump and his administration. The show\u2019s creators actually thought that resisting Trump\u2019s presidency was a good idea and a great reason to do a reboot of the once popular show. They were wrong.\n\nI watched a few of the shows of the series reboot but it was basically unwatchable. The writing was bad, the jokes were usually non-existent, and there was really no reason for a conservative to watch. It was a shame, too, because I enjoyed the original show, back in the day. Back then it was fresh and a little edgy with openly gay characters but most of all, it was funny. The dialogue was clever and quick-witted. Everyone was subject to good-natured jabs. The reboot was completely one-sided \u2013 ugly remarks aimed at Trump and his administration, and Republicans in general. Fortunately, the show was cancelled this summer after three seasons. The show\u2019s ratings steadily dropped each season. It turns out that Americans don\u2019t want such blatant partisan politics in silly sitcoms during primetime viewing hours. Bringing back a show from the 1990s just because Trump won the 2016 election and Hillary was Hollywood\u2019s candidate of choice didn\u2019t work out so well. Just ask the creators and stars of Murphy Brown about it.\n\nBipartisan political jabs do still work, though, in sitcoms and the reboot of Roseanne is a great example of that. The show was hugely popular but the liberals couldn\u2019t stand it and then Roseanne Barr was caught up in a Twitter kerfuffle of her own making.\n\nFreedom of speech is a one-way street for liberal Americans. Trump knows this and uses it to his advantage. His politically incorrect speech worked to his favor in 2016.\n\nTrump\u2019s fundraiser in Beverly Hills is during Emmy week. There will be numerous events for the television entertainment industry to celebrate itself. The Trump re-election campaign is clever that way. His trip to California will take away some of the spotlight from Hollywood. There is also a fundraiser scheduled in San Francisco \u2013 the belly of the liberal beast \u2013 on September 17.\n\nA \u201csave the date\u201d invite shows that the president will visit the Bay Area region on Sept. 17 for an event at an undisclosed location hosted by RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chair Tommy Hicks Jr., RNC Finance Chairman Todd Ricketts and Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. Though polls show that Trump is unpopular in solidly blue California, where Republicans account for less than a quarter of the state\u2019s registered voters, Dhillon predicts that Trump\u2019s events will sell out quickly. \u201cEvery presidential candidate who has the potential to raise money comes to the Bay Area, and I expect he\u2019s going to have a series of very successful fundraisers here,\u201d Dhillon told POLITICO, \u201cbecause there are millions of Californians who support him.\u2019\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s hope Dhillon is right. California went completely Democrat in 2018, including Orange County, once a solidly Republican oasis. The Trump fundraising swing through California also includes an event in San Diego on September 18.", "description": "Freedom of Speech", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1780881b-c4a5-495d-9626-9a6daba9042d.jpg"}
