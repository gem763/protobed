Sir Martin wrote: \"That decision could and should have been made between 01:30 and 01:50 and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities.\"\n\nFirefighters who attended the fire did not have training on how best to combat a cladding fire, the report added.\n\nFour experienced members of the first crews to have fought the blaze had not received any training on the risks posed by exterior cladding or the techniques to be deployed in fighting fires involving cladding, the report found.\n\nSir Martin said the \"principal\" reason the fire spread so quickly \"up, down and around the building was the presence of the aluminium composite material (ACM) rainscreen panels with polyethylene cores, which acted as a source of fuel\".\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Dany Cotton said she would not have changed anything about the way her brigade responded to the blaze\n\nThe report also said evidence given by the LFB's commissioner, Dany Cotton, suggested lessons from the fire might be missed.\n\nSir Martin wrote: \"Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped from their burning homes with their lives, the Commissioner's evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB on the night, even with the benefit of hindsight, only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the LFB said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment on the report's findings before they were officially released on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Sir Martin said the report was long and detailed.\n\nHe stressed that readers of the report \"should understand as clearly as possible the terrifying conditions faced by those who were in the building, at the time\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The families of the 72 victims contributed to the report\n\nThe cause of the fire was found by the report to be \"an electrical fault in the large fridge freezer in the kitchen\" in a fourth-floor flat.\n\n\"It occurred without any fault on the part of the tenant... and I am pleased to clear him of any blame, given that some people have unfairly accused him of having some responsibility for what happened,\" Sir Martin wrote.", "description": "A fire brigade's response to the deadly blaze in a west London tower block is condemned in a report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DE07/production/_103793865_hi049727592.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
