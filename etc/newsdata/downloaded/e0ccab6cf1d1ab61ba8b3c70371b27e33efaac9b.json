Reuters\n\nSingapore plans to issue licences to operate two full-fledged 5G networks and two smaller ones with limited coverage.\n\nAll four networks can be rolled out by next year, although nationwide coverage will take much longer and be limited to only two networks due to the scarcity of 5G airwaves for islandwide reach.\n\nMinister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran announced the decision on Thursday (Oct 17).\n\nHere is a quick guide to the key announcements and reasons.\n\n1. WHY IS SINGAPORE PUSHING FOR FOUR 5G NETWORKS INSTEAD OF TWO?\n\nThe Infocomm Media Development Authority\u2019s (IMDA) plans became more aggressive after a two-month-long public consultation earlier this year, during which there were calls for the involvement of all four telcos here \u2013 Singtel, StarHub, M1 and TPG Telecom \u2013 to spur innovation and competition. IMDA heeded these calls.\n\nAs there are limited 5G airwaves for islandwide reach, IMDA cannot allow more than two nationwide networks in Singapore.The alternative is to give out more licences to run smaller 5G networks and more of another type of airwaves \u2013 known as millimetre airwaves \u2013 to support their roll-out.\n\nThis approach will ensure that none of the four telcos, or any innovative ideas, will be missed out.\n\n2. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?\n\nThe smaller 5G networks will meet immediate industrial needs \u2013 for example, in smart ports and factories to remotely operate cranes or vehicles to move shipping containers or goods round the clock.\n\nMillimetre airwaves are in abundance, and 5G networks built using these can be rolled out as quickly as next year.\n\n\u201cThey will be useful for consumer applications like virtual reality and augmented reality gaming,\u201d said Mr Ramakrishna Maruvada, a regional telecoms analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets. He noted that telcos could monetise these applications first before spending more money to roll out the full-fledged 5G networks.\n\nPlus, the 5G airwaves for islandwide reach (the 3.5Ghz band) will be available only in 2021.\n\n\u201cSingapore is already slower than South Korea, China and the United States, which have launched 5G services using a combination of the far-reaching 3.5Ghz airwaves as well as the millimetre airwaves,\u201d said Mr Sachin Mittal, head of telco research at DBS Bank. He expects Singapore to be the first country in South-east Asia to launch 5G services.\n\n3. HOW IS HUAWEI GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS EXERCISE?\n\nThe two 5G networks with nationwide coverage must be built with the most advanced technologies \u2013 called \u201cstandalone\u201d 5G technologies \u2013 that do not piggyback on existing 4G technologies.\n\nThis will give local telcos an opportunity to pick equipment suppliers from scratch to realise the full benefits that 5G networks promise.\n\nAny \u201clock-in\u201d to existing 4G vendors for a cheap and quick migration to 5G \u2013 an advantage that Huawei has over rivals \u2013 will not be able to influence telcos\u2019 long-term decisions on 5G.\n\nHowever, 5G networks built to work on the millimetre airwaves are allowed to piggyback on existing 4G technologies at the start until more advanced technologies are available.\n\nUnlike some countries which have banned Huawei over espionage concerns, Singapore has not barred any vendors, but says systems must meet security requirements.\n\n4. WHAT WILL MY SURFING EXPERIENCE BE LIKE IF ONLY HALF OF SINGAPORE HAS 5G COVERAGE?\n\nUsers of 5G handsets moving out of a 5G coverage area will not experience surfing disruption as they will automatically be connected to a 4G connection with the same telco. Hopping across different telco networks is not possible.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - As there are limited 5G airwaves for islandwide reach, there will only be two nationwide networks in Singapore..
