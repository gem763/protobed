You can watch examples of the various descriptions by Democrats of the status of impeachment in the video above.\n\nThe committee is scheduled to meet at 8 a.m. Thursday to vote on a resolution to expand its investigatory options to include rarely used procedures to look into Trump.\n\nOver the past three days, House Democrats have characterized Thursday\u2019s vote in three ways: as a procedural motion, as a formalizing of an existing impeachment inquiry and as the start of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re holding hearings for the purpose of investigating the possibility of voting [on] articles of impeachment,\u201d Nadler told NBC News this week.\n\nOn Monday morning, a second member of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Fla.), told CNN that it was \u201cno secret\u201d that the committee was conducting an impeachment investigation.\n\nLater on Monday, a third member of the committee, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), said Thursday\u2019s vote would \u201cformalize having an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nAnd on Wednesday, a fourth member of the committee, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), would not commit that an impeachment inquiry was underway.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a Judiciary Committee investigation,\u201d Jeffries said.\n\nIn fact, Nadler\u2019s comments in August acknowledged that House Democrats had started an impeachment inquiry when the Judiciary Committee in July argued in a court filing that it needed the full, unredacted report from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III because it \u201cis conducting an investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.\u201d\n\nDebating where impeachment stands is confusing and jargon-heavy. But Democrats\u2019 semantic contortions this week are significant. They suggest a nonexistent or confusing messaging strategy on impeachment, which is the most serious investigation the House can consider.\n\nThe confusion also reflects two more realities for House Democrats: Most Americans and most House lawmakers oppose an impeachment inquiry, even as a majority of House Democrats support one.\n\nFourteen months before the 2020 presidential election, Democratic leadership does not have its impeachment messaging straight.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters that an impeachment inquiry was not underway.\n\nHere is the complete transcript of my question to Mr. Hoyer about whether he thinks an impeachment inquiry is currently underway. pic.twitter.com/uCw6gebAqr \u2014 Sheryl Gay Stolberg (@SherylNYT) September 11, 2019\n\nLess than two hours later, Hoyer offered a clarification that wasn\u2019t exactly clarifying.\n\n\u201cI thought the question was in regards to whether the full House is actively considering articles of impeachment, which we are not at this time,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201c \u2026 I strongly support Chairman Nadler and the Judiciary Committee Democrats as they proceed with their investigation \u2018to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House,\u2019 as the resolution states.\u201d\n\nRachael Bade and Amber Phillips contributed to this analysis.", "description": "Over the past two weeks, House Democrats have provided no fewer than three different explanations for what steps the House Judiciary Committee is taking on impeachment.", "authors": ["Jm Rieger", "Video Editor For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-11-2019/t_a16e27c800934858822da678ede66d59_name_65ca7f16_8b6e_11e9_b6f4_033356502dce_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
