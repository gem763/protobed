This target was met two years before the deadline. Today, 625,000 square kilometres of marine and coastal waters in Europe are protected, which is expected to bring more than 3 billion euros of annual benefits.\n\nIn 2001, Torre Guaceto imposed a five-year ban on fishing to rebuild the catastrophically declining stocks. Today, a few locals are permitted to fish for just one day a week, using nets that can\u2019t catch small fish.\n\nFisherman Cosimo De Biasi told Ocean: \u201cBefore the reserve was established, this whole area was rife with dynamite fishing, cigarette smuggling and illegal immigrants. Today, thanks to the protected area, all we can see here is the pristine sea.\u201d\n\nThe protected area is managed by a consortium that represents local communities and the World Wide Fund for Nature, the WWF.\n\nIt enforces the rules that have been agreed with the fishermen. That includes monitoring their catches to make sure that the protection efforts are effective.\n\nAnd the fishermen are happy with the new controls on what they catch.\n\n\u201cWhen we catch a big fish and bring it ashore, we can sell it not for five euros, but for 20 to 25 euros,\u201d De Biasi said.\n\nFrancesco de Franco, head of the environmental and technical unit at the Torre Guaceto consortium, said fish stocks have recovered in the marine reserve.\n\n\u201cOutside the protected area, the levels of fish remain basically the same as in the past. And inside this area, the fish stocks have roughly doubled,\" he said.\n\nWider benefits\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the sea that\u2019s being protected. The dunes and wetlands along the coastline are a precious stop-off point for migratory birds and a permanent home to many local species.\n\nThe Torre Guaceto area, named after its centuries-old watchtower, is patrolled day and night by the coast guard and the police. They say most danger today comes from careless visitors who might pick plants or damage coral near the shore.\n\nTourists who respect the environment are welcome).\n\nIn the past, these sandy beaches were full of litter and overcrowded. Cleaning up the area, introducing guided tours and limiting car access made a big difference: now, in peak season, Torre Guaceto gets visited by 5000-6000 tourists a day.\n\nMimmo Miccoli from Brescia has been visiting for years.\n\n\u201cThis place used to be a mess, with cars parked everywhere,\" he told Ocean. \"Now, all the cars have to be left in the car park at the top of the road \u2014 so the place is now much nicer, cleaner.\u201d\n\nThe flow of tourists also benefits businesses that have embraced the trend for sustainability.\n\nMaria Lanzilotti runs a restaurant in nearby Carovigno which specialises in local organic cuisine.\n\n\u201cWe always have fresh, good, healthy fish from the sea,\" she said. \"And our land produces local tomatoes and so on, so it is very important for me and for all of us restaurateurs to have this natural reserve \u2014 it\u2019s our marvel!\u201d\n\nBacked by European funds, one-third of local farms have now converted to organic production, boosting their sales by associating their brands with the now famous Torre Guaceto protected area.\n\nEstablished to preserve the environment, this marine protected area became an attractive eco-tourism destination with a sustainable economy \u2014 a success story that experts say should serve an example to other places like Torre Guaceto.\n\nNicol\u00f2 Carnimeo, vice-president of the Torre Guaceto management consortium, said: \u201cI would say that protecting 10 per cent of Europe\u2019s waters is still not enough \u2014 we should go further, keeping in mind the so-called circular economy, like what we have here. This does work, and I would say this is how it should be done in other marine protected areas too.\u201d", "description": "In less than 20 years, an Italian coastal area has transformed itself from a lawless wasteland into an international success story.", "authors": ["Denis Loctier"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/91/95/68/1000x563_cmsv2_ea8ab9b9-32c7-5d76-8b19-6adbfede8b72-3919568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-21"}
