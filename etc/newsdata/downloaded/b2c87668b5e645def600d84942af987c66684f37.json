It\u2019s very difficult to maintain your performance level at his age but he keeps doing that,\u201d added Moreno.\n\n\u201cBut (under-21 coach) Luis de la Fuente is the one who has to decide whether or not Ramos goes to the Olympics.\u201d", "description": "Sixteen-year-old forward Ansu Fati could figure in Spain's Euro 2020 squad, national coach Robert Moreno said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439798303&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1VI", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
