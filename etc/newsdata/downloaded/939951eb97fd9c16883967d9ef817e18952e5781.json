Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who would have broad latitude to organize extended questioning of potential public witnesses. Two other committees who have so far participated in the closed-door investigation into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine \u2014 Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform \u2014 would not be permitted to directly participate in the open proceedings under the legislation.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nIt also sets out for the first time the ability of House Republicans to make their own requests for testimony and documents, though those requests will ultimately be subject to a vote of the Democratic-majority committee \u2014 a practice that matches the minority powers in the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nLawmakers are expected to vote on the measure Thursday, according to multiple Democratic aides who were not authorized to comment publicly. The House Rules Committee will debate and potentially amend the measure at a panel meeting Wednesday afternoon.\n\nRules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said Tuesday the resolution \u201coutlines the next steps in this inquiry, including establishing the procedure for public-facing hearings conducted by the Intelligence Committee and the process for transferring evidence to the Judiciary Committee once they are completed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s Republican allies in Congress have tried to hide the president\u2019s conduct, but the American people will now see the facts firsthand,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the resolution\u2019s release Tuesday, House Republican leaders blasted the Democratic tactics, arguing that the impeachment process was fatally flawed from the beginning and cannot be redeemed with the adoption of new procedures.\n\nSlideshow by photo services\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). \u201cDue process starts from the beginning.\u201d\n\nBy confining the public hearings to the Intelligence Committee and excluding the other two panels that have participated in the closed-door interviews, Democrats are in effect sidelining several of the GOP\u2019s most agressive and outspoken defenders of President Trump. They include Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mark Meadows (N.C.), who serve on the Oversight panel, as well as Rep. Lee Zeldin (N.Y.) of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who have led the public pushback to the Democratic impeachment effort in the House.\n\nJordan said Tuesday that Democrats were \u201ctrying to put a ribbon on an already terrible process.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complete garbage,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t undo what they\u2019ve done thus far. All the abuse of due process, all of the unfairness \u2014 they can try to dress it up, have a fancy resolution on the floor. But it does nothing. It\u2019s still a sham process.\u201d\n\nPelosi announced plans to vote on the resolution in a letter to Democratic members Monday, and, according to three House aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions, she kept a tight leash on the process of drafting the measure \u2014 excluding the rank-and-file and even other Democratic leaders.\n\nAddressing reporters Tuesday morning, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said he had not yet scheduled a vote on the resolution \u2014 contradicting Pelosi, who pledged to hold a vote this week.\n\n\u00a9 Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post Committee Chairman Adam Schiff(D-Calif.) talks to reporters on Capitol Hill on Oct. 8.\n\n\u201cI have not read it yet; the members have not read it yet,\u201d Hoyer said, showing some frustration at a meeting with reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to consider whether or not it\u2019s ready to go on Thursday. I hope that is the case.\u201d\n\nThe resolution was released hours later, and Democrats quickly fell in line \u2014 including some of those who might be sidelined by Pelosi\u2019s decision to have Schiff and the Intelligence Committee take the lead.\n\n\u201cNobody is looking for their five minutes of glory,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary and Oversight panels. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for an impeachment process that has serious integrity.\u201d\n\nBesides setting out procedures for public hearings in the Intelligence Committee, the resolution would also authorize that panel and four other committees investigating Trump to publicly release interview transcripts and transfer their investigative materials to the House Judiciary Committee, which is expected to draft articles of impeachment based on the other panels\u2019 findings.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee would also have the power to hold public hearings of its own under similar procedures to those given to the Intelligence Committee.\n\nUnder the resolution, both panels could engage in extended questioning of witnesses in rounds of up to 45 minutes, alternating between the two parties, before beginning the traditional five-minute rounds extended to panel members under existing rules. Both lawmakers and staff would be authorized to question witnesses.\n\nRepublicans have raised questions about Trump\u2019s right to be personally represented by counsel during the impeachment proceedings, noting that Clinton had lawyers present during the House\u2019s consideration of articles in 1998. Responding to those concerns, the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday issued a three-page summary of procedural safeguards for the president.\n\nThey include the right of the president or his counsel to recommend additional testimony or evidence for the committee\u2019s review, to attend all hearings and question any witnesses who testify, and generally to respond to the allegations against him \u201corally or in writing as shall be determined by the chair.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats included a significant caveat: Should Trump \u201cunlawfully refuse\u201d to comply with subpoenas issued by the investigating committees, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) would \u201chave the discretion to impose appropriate remedies\u201d \u2014 including the denial of Trump\u2019s requests to call or question witnesses.\n\nDemocratic leaders have been careful not to characterize the measure as authorizing the impeachment inquiry, something they say has been underway already for weeks without a House vote.\n\n\u201cWe have an inquiry looking at whether articles of impeachment are justified by the facts,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that. We are doing it. We\u2019re going to continue to do it. This is about process as to when we move to out of the investigatory phase, which we\u2019ve been in, into a phase where we have public hearings. That\u2019s what it is. No more. No less.\u201d\n\nSeveral Democrats said Tuesday they believed the vote would undermine Republicans, who for weeks have raised objections to the process Democrats have undertaken and have called for a formal vote on launching impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe message this week is going to be: You asked for it, you got it,\u201d said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.).\n\nSeveral members who attended a caucus meeting held at the Democratic National Committee on Tuesday morning said they were ready to vote to formalize the next step in the impeachment investigation \u2014 including some in swing districts where the vote could be a political liability.\n\n\u201cI have no qualms about taking a vote,\u201d said Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), a freshman running in a district Trump previously won by 7 points. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clearly in an impeachment inquiry, and laying out the plans for the next step, I think, is a helpful thing to do for the American people to understand the parameters of the public hearings.\u201d\n\nRep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), a veteran lawmaker whose district voted for Trump by 5 points in 2016, also said he planned to support the measure: \u201cWe fully support a thorough investigation, and we\u2019re going to continue doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nBut at least one Democrat has said he planned to vote no, citing the upcoming presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m friends with the president. It\u2019s not that I believe he should be protected. I don\u2019t mind if he\u2019s investigated,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.). \u201cBut what\u2019s going to happen in my mind, it\u2019s going to happen here in the House; it will go over to the Senate and then he will believe that he has been exonerated. He will still be the president, and he will still be the candidate \u2014 a candidate who has been exonerated by the Senate.\u201d\n\nmike.debonis@washpost.com", "description": "The resolution hands the lead role to the House Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Rep.
