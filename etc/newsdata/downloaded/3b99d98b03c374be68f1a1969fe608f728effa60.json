It\u2019s part of the gig: I\u2019m a rabbi. And my Hebrew name \u2014 Avraham Yitzhak \u2014 is common enough that I often see myself on gravestones, an eerie reminder of the liturgy we\u2019ll recite this Rosh Hashana: \u201cA man\u2019s origin and end is from dust.\u201d\n\nBut last month, I came face to face with my actual name : Avram Mlotek. There it was, on a stone right next to that bearing the name of my grandfather, Joseph Mlotek.\n\nI found their legacies in Vilnius, a city that once teemed with Jewish life. For centuries before World War II, it was called the \u201cJerusalem of Lithuania\u201d and bustled with synagogues, schools and Yiddish writers. Jews of my generation often know much about how these ancestors died, but little about how they lived. Going to Vilna, as it is known in Yiddish, was a reminder of that vibrancy. It was also a painful reminder that culture alone is not enough to protect a people.\n\nThe Mloteks, though, were not longtime residents of that dynamic city. When they came to town it was because they were running for their lives.", "description": "In the city where my grandfather was saved, I stood with a young Jewish couple under their wedding canopy.", "authors": ["Avram Mlotek"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/opinion/29Mlotek1/29Mlotek1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
