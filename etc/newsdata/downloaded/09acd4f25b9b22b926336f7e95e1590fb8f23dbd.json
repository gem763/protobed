The ruling opens the way for additional discovery into the decision-making process.\n\nMr Tornetta had asked that the pay package be rescinded and the board of Tesla be overhauled to better protect investors.\n\nThe ruling turned on Tesla's compensation committee, which the company conceded was not independent of Mr Musk, according to the judge's opinion. Had the package been negotiated by truly independent directors and approved by a majority of shareholders who were unaffiliated with Mr Musk, the judge said he would have dismissed the lawsuit.\n\n\"Plaintiff has well pled, however, that the board level review was not divorced from Musk's influence,\" the judge wrote.\n\nMr Musk's compensation package passed shareholder approval with about 73 per cent of votes cast, excluding votes by Mr Musk and his brother Kimbal. The vote result indicated some, but not all, big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company, which has struggled to produce its electric vehicles efficiently and profitably.\n\nAt the time, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against the compensation, noting that if achieved Mr Musk's award would surpass anything previously granted to top US executives.\n\nUnder the award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla's market value must increase to US$100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional US$50 billion increments for the remainder. The package does not require Tesla to hit profitability metrics.\n\nMr Musk does not hold a majority of the Tesla's stock, but in a separate case, the judge determined that Mr Musk's sway over Tesla made him in effect a controller from a legal standpoint. As a controller, the board is subject to a higher standard of legal oversight for decisions it makes regarding its relationship with Mr Musk.\n\nThe judge did dismiss Mr Tornetta's claim that the package amounted to a waste of corporate assets.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [WILMINGTON] A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that Tesla Inc's board of directors must defend chief executive Elon Musk's multibillion dollar pay package at a trial, which a shareholder lawsuit said unjustly enriched the head of the electric vehicle company. .
