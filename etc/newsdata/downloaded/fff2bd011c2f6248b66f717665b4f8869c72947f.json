We'll be following the Meghan Markle Effect\u2122 with our column, \"Meghan Markle Wore a Thing.\"\n\nAfter a whirlwind first couple of days in South Africa, Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle took a little break from all the public appearances (and coordinating outfit changes), but new photos have just emerged from a private one. On Thursday, she gathered a group of female South African activists, parliamentarians, professors, educators and policy makers to discuss women's rights issues in the country, including gender-based inequality and violence.\n\n\"In the lead up to this tour it weighed heavily on my heart to see the countless violations against women, and I wanted to spend my time on the ground learning about the situation at hand,\" the Duchess wrote in an Instagram caption Sunday.\n\nFor the intimate event, Markle wore a knit midi skirt by one of her favorite affordable brands, J.Crew, with a simple black sleeveless top. Retailing for $130, the skirt is still available in a couple of sizes here and here.\n\nShe's not due for another public appearance until Tuesday, but someone did manage to snap a photo of her at the Cape Town Airport with Archie, where they were preparing to board a flight to Johannesburg. Her airport look comprised a few favorite wardrobe staples: a J.Crew button-down, DL1961 jeans and Birdies slippers, according to Meghan's Mirror.\n\nSee more things the Duchess of Sussex has worn in the gallery below:\n\nAn Everlane jumpsuit in Africa.
