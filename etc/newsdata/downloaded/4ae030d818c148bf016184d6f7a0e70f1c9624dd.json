Victory would mean that Democrats had flipped a district that candidate Donald Trump won in 2016, while a narrow margin of defeat could be spun as a sign that suburban districts are at least in play for 2020.\n\nREP-ELECT DAN BISHOP CREDITS TRUMP FOR SPECIAL ELECTION WIN IN NORTH CAROLINA RACE\n\nWhen the results came in showing that Republican Dan Bishop had won by about a two-point margin, the left immediately set about trying to claim victory in defeat. The circumstances surrounding the race, however, suggest a very different takeaway.\n\nDan Bishop needed help badly. He was hampered from the outset by his party affiliation, for instance, because the whole reason for the special election was alleged voter fraud on the part of the GOP candidate who ran for the seat in 2018.\n\nBishop\u2019s opponent, meanwhile, was a Marine Corps veteran and political outsider who avoided controversial issues with vague platitudes, positioning himself as a middle-of-the-road moderate. Even so, the Democrats didn\u2019t want to leave anything to chance, outspending Bishop\u2019s campaign by a factor of more than two-to-one.\n\nIn fact, the Bishop campaign was down 17 points just three weeks ago, indicating that the district\u2019s historical record of voting for Republican candidates had little relevance in this unique situation.\n\nThis is presumably why Democrats and the media chose the 9th District rather than 3rd District congressional special election in North Carolina to use as a litmus test of the president\u2019s re-election chances.\n\nThe concurrent special election in the 3rd Congressional District, which Republican Dr. Greg Murphy won handily, took place under much more typical circumstances, with vote shares closely matching the partisan makeup of the district.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOnce President Trump got more closely involved with Bishop\u2019s campaign, however, Bishop\u2019s race quickly began to tighten up, turning it into a statistical dead heat by the time the election rolled around.\n\nEven Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos was forced to admit that the president\u2019s rally in Fayetteville on the night before the election was a decisive factor in putting Bishop over the top, contradicting her party\u2019s narrative about Trump\u2019s supposed electoral weakness.\n\nDEMS ADMIT TRUMP HELPED GOP CANDIDATES SWEEP NORTH CAROLINA SPECIAL ELECTIONS\n\nIf the election in the 9th Congressional District was a referendum on President Trump, as the left claimed it was, then the miraculous turnaround in Bishop\u2019s prospects actually indicates that the president\u2019s personal popularity remains the strongest advantage the Republican Party has in the 2020 elections.\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe mainstream media and the Democratic Party establishment clearly thought that the North Carolina special elections would confirm their wishful thinking about President Trump\u2019s electoral appeal. Instead, Dan Bishop\u2019s victory just proved that the president is still as potent a political force as ever.\n\nWhat should be most distressing of all for the Democrats is the knowledge that President Trump will be able to leverage that popularity to boost Republican candidates all over the country in 2020, just like he did for Dan Bishop in North Carolina.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM LARA TRUMP", "description": "There\u2019s no denying that President Trump was the driving force behind the Republican victories in North Carolina\u2019s special elections Tuesday, spoiling liberal plans to spin the results into a rebuke of his presidency.", "authors": ["Lara Trump", "Lara Trump Is A Senior Advisor To Donald J.
