They endure months of cultural and geographical isolation in exchange for weekly paychecks of hundreds of dollars from crab processing plants to help support their families back home.\n\nIt is a sensitive time politically for the workers, who are nearly all women, and for the H-2B visa program, which grants them temporary entrance to the United States.\n\nVowing to put American workers first and protect the nation\u2019s security, President Trump threatened earlier this year to close the southern border and impose tariffs on Mexican goods.\n\nThe H-2B program, which is more than 30 years old, has continued under Trump, although crab processing plants complained they were left shorthanded last year because the administration didn\u2019t allow enough workers into the country.\n\nTo get the visas, companies must first demonstrate they can\u2019t recruit American workers \u2014 through advertising and other means \u2014 to fill the jobs.\n\n\n\nMelva Guadalupe Vazquez, 28, gets ready to clean her station at Lindy's Seafood plant on Hoopers Island. (Thalia Juarez/Baltimore Sun)\n\nMelva Guadalupe Vazquez, 28, who came here from central Mexico in the spring under the program, knows that not everyone believes Mexican workers are needed.\n\nCritics of the visa program, including immigration hard-liners, argue that guest workers potentially shut out Americans and lower the bar on what is appropriate to pay relatively unskilled labor.\n\nVazquez pauses and her eyes fill with tears at the idea that she and other guest workers are taking American jobs.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear that I get really mad,\u201d said Vazquez, who arrived with her iPhone loaded with photos and videos of her 7-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter. \u201cIt makes me mad because, when I\u2019m working, I look at my hands and they\u2019re bleeding, they\u2019re hurt, they\u2019re tired.\u201d\n\nShe believes most Americans \u201ctruly don\u2019t want to be doing this.\u201d\n\nBig demand for workers\n\nDemand for the H-2B program is so high that congressional Democrats and Republicans often complain there aren\u2019t enough visas for such industries as seafood processing, landscaping, housekeeping and amusement parks. So many applicants seeking the visas \u2014 including Maryland crab houses \u2014 logged into a website run by the U.S. Labor Department in the first moments of Jan. 1 that the system crashed within five minutes, according to the department.\n\n[Eastern Shore crab houses suffered because they didn\u2019t get the visas needed to hire enough pickers from Mexico]\n\n\u201cWe cannot find [domestic] workers,\u201d said Jay Newcomb, owner of Old Salty\u2019s Restaurant in Fishing Creek. \u201cWe\u2019ve done job fairs, we\u2019ve contacted the detention centers, run ads all over the East Coast. We\u2019ve tried colleges and temp agencies.\u201d\n\nPushback comes from those who say the H-2B program is inconsistent with Trump\u2019s pledge to put American workers first.\n\n\u201cThe way you draw idle people back into the world of work is to keep the labor market tight, not by pulling in guest workers,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank supporting tighter immigration controls.\n\nTrump has used H-2B workers as cooks, servers and housekeepers at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, according to online Labor Department records. \u201cWe are an exclusive, high-end private club located in Palm Beach, Florida,\u201d said an H-2B application for Mar-a-Lago housekeepers this year. \u201cWe offer social and recreational activities for which demand greatly increases during Florida\u2019s peak season from October through May.\u201d\n\nIn interviews conducted mostly in Spanish, Vazquez and other workers appeared torn about how \u2014 or whether \u2014 to respond to critical statements about seasonal workers and Mexico. Vazquez cited Trump\u2019s comments and accused him of \u201cracismo,\u201d Spanish for racism. Others hedged their comments so as not to seem ungrateful or jeopardize job opportunities that their families have come to rely on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to take anyone\u2019s job. There are a lot of Latino hands in this country lifting up the economic life of this country,\u201d said Vazquez, who has traveled to Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore for crab season the past three years. \u201cI do not accept or agree with the ideals of the president we currently have here in the United States, but I also respect the decisions that are made, good or bad. As long as we are offered work visas, then we\u2019ll be here.\u201d\n\nVazquez was interviewed at the ranch house, where women sleep on bunk beds and hang their clothes on a line outside. The laborers say they must constantly wash clothes because the pungent crab smell seems to attach itself to the material.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind because the smell of crabs is the smell of money,\u201d said Martha Olivares Garcia, 64, of Veracruz, who has been a guest worker for nearly 30 years. Pickers add to their hourly rate \u2014 generally $9.60 \u2014 based on their production, and some earn more than $500 a week.\n\nIn return, they spend as long as eight months \u2014 some arrive in April and don\u2019t leave until November.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here alone,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anyone. We just know each other.\u201d\n\nAll in a day's work\n\nAt Lindy\u2019s Seafood, where Vazquez and Garcia work, shifts may begin at 2 a.m. They run up to 10 hours, depending on the volume of crabs, with a one-hour lunch break.\n\nVazquez heard about the program from other workers and a local recruiter in Ciudad del Maiz, the municipality in central Mexico where she lives.\n\n\u201cWe leave our kids and they\u2019re so young, so it\u2019s really difficult to talk about,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cSometimes you lie. You have to tell your children, you know, \u2018It\u2019ll just be a few days.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBefore heading for work, she packs a lunch, a pair of gloves and two small crab picking knives, then walks down a narrow road a quarter-mile to work.\n\nInside the plant \u2014 a squat, white cinder block building \u2014 the crabs are wheeled in on a dolly the size of a small dumpster, then placed in piles on long, stainless steel tables for picking.\n\nThe gloved workers crack the shells and quickly maneuver their knives, piling the meat into small plastic containers marked with numbers to identify how much each laborer extracted.\n\nThe only sound \u2014 save occasionally for Spanish-language music \u2014 is a constant rustling as the knives work and the shells are cracked.\n\nVisa shortages\n\nIn the 1980s, crab houses started bringing workers from Mexico.\n\nBut last year, changes to the H-2B program left crab processing plants in Dorchester County teetering on the precipice, with half of the county\u2019s eight picking houses unable to secure enough visas.\n\nFamily businesses such as Lindy\u2019s \u201chad a lot of conversations that were really scary about how are we going to get through this,\u201d said sales manager Aubrey Vincent. She said Lindy\u2019s \u2014 which usually has annual sales of about $9 million to $10 million \u2014 had to unload many crabs whole instead of selling their meat to restaurants and grocery stores much more profitably. Selling crabs whole usually yields at least 50 percent less money.\n\nOther plants also reported revenue being cut nearly in half, and Dorchester\u2019s economy felt the effects.\n\nThis year, the plants said they got enough visas but remain concerned because they believe the program has gotten caught up in the administration\u2019s efforts to tighten immigration policies.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next year,\u201d said Bill Seiling, executive vice president of the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association.\n\n'I hope my kids understand'\n\nWhen they\u2019re not working or sleeping, the workers watch Spanish-language soap operas in the houses they share or play on their phones.\n\nOften, they talk to their children in Mexico on video apps that don\u2019t always function because of poor cell signals or lackluster WiFi.\n\n\u201cFor the most part we really don\u2019t have any time,\u201d said Garcia, the Lindy\u2019s worker who first entered the program at a Virginia plant 29 years ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always working. We even work Saturdays. The only day we take off is Sunday when they take us out to buy groceries,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I have the opportunity, I go to Mass on Sundays.\u201d\n\nStaying busy is a salve of sorts because it blocks out the yearning to be back with their families. It is for them that Garcia, Vazquez and the others endure the separation year after year, earning money that in a rural Mexican village might pay for food all winter or finance such luxuries as an indoor bathroom. Garcia, who lives in a small city, said she has used the income to pay for her three daughters\u2019 education.\n\n\u201cI hope my kids understand one day why I do this,\u201d Vazquez said, \u201cand why I have to be away.\u201d", "description": "It is a sensitive time politically for workers on the H-2B visa program, which grants them temporary entry to the United States.", "authors": ["Jeff Barker", "Thalia Juarez", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KfyZ_ZbQCCAvJR68ZnvnSUUKymg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6RL4XXHG5UI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
