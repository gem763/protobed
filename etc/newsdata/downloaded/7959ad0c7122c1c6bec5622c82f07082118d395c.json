While durable wheels aren\u2019t as important for cabin bags as they are for larger bags \u2013 they\u2019re likely to be lighter so easier to carry, and the wheels will come under less strain \u2013 we also put the wheeled cases through their paces on our street obstacle course of pavements, cracked paving slabs and potholes. We usually preferred spinners, where the wheels spin 360 degrees.\n\nAs well as classic wheeled bags that are perfect for a business trip or weekend away, it\u2019s worth considering duffels and backpacks, particularly if you\u2019re planning a more varied holiday and know you'll be slinging the bag in a bus hold then running with it to a train terminal.\n\nBut often even the best-planned holidays are unpredictable: a missed bus could see you trundling your case over all kinds of terrain. Thankfully manufacturers seem to get that: we were really impressed with the versatility of many of the bags we tested, particularly the convertible wheeled backpacks, like Kathmandu and Osprey, and duffel bags that doubled as rucksacks, like Ortlieb and Gregory.\n\nWhatever kind of holiday you have planned, these are the bags to bring for a smooth journey from door to door..\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

This is a godsend for slapdash packers like our reviewer: if you run out of space, pop the clasps at the top and bottom of the bag to release an extra couple of inches of room (22 per cent more space, Briggs & Riley says, bringing it to almost 50l capacity \u2013 incredible for a cabin bag). Zip it closed, push down hard and the bag compresses itself back to cabin size again.\n\nWe really overstuffed the case and it worked like a charm: no more sitting on the lid to try and force the zip closed. This is typical of a bag that\u2019s so classy \u2013 from its soft, sand-coloured lining, to the padded internal coat-hanger \u2013 you feel like it should have its own butler to pack and unpack it. It glides like a dream, has timeless good looks, and comes with a lifetime guarantee. Expensive, yes, but you\u2019ll never need to buy another case again.\n\nBuy now\n\nVictorinox lexicon hardside global carry on cabin bag: \u00a3395, Victorinox\n\nDimensions: H58 x W41 D21cm\n\nCapacity: 34l\n\nWeight: 3.2kg\n\nA wonderful piece of Swiss engineering, this was without doubt the toughest case we tested: our reviewer would happily trust it with her most fragile camera equipment. Its smooth profile packs an impressive 34l of space, and everything about it is sleek and refined: the slate grey inner pockets, the recessed wheels and handle. But \u2013 like the Swiss army knives for which Victorinox are famous \u2013 the best thing about this case is the sheer number of smart features it tucks away.\n\nThere\u2019s an internal pocket for a portable battery, for example, with a built-in USB cable whose external port is hidden underneath a multitool (containing an impossibly tiny biro and sim card remover) that is itself hidden in the handle. There\u2019s even a pocket for a Swiss army knife (although definitely don\u2019t pack one if you\u2019re flying with the case). Our reviewer loved this bag largely because it made her feel like James Bond.\n\nBuy now\n\nKathmandu hybrid trolley bag: \u00a390.99, Wiggle\n\nDimensions: H56 x W36cm x D23cm\n\nCapacity: 32l\n\nWeight: 2.36kg\n\nA brilliant idea by Kathmandu, this clever little cabin bag converts from a wheeled bag into a rucksack, thanks to the straps concealed in its back panel. It looks smaller than its 32 litres \u2013 so brilliant if you\u2019re planning to fly with a strict airline \u2013 and has plenty of handy features, like a front pocket that\u2019s small tablet sized and ideal for travel documents.\n\nThe backpack is easy to deploy and feels comfortable enough: you wouldn\u2019t want to hike with it, and the wheels do make it look a bit novel, but that\u2019s a small price to pay for having a bag that can switch effortlessly between airport terminals and busy streets. Remember to tuck away the backpack straps before wheeling or they can get caught in the wheels.\n\nBuy now\n\nSamsonite darts spinner cabin bag: \u00a3151.20, Samsonite\n\n\n\nDimensons: H55 x W40 x D20cm\n\nCapacity: 36l\n\nWeight: 2.6kg\n\nA really innovative case, the darts spinner has a flexible front that pops open to let you access the top half of the case without having to unzip the whole bag. It\u2019s really well thought out \u2013 the bit of case you can access contains a small pocket about the right size of electricals and some liquids \u2013 but we did find bending the plastic a bit alarming. It looked fine afterwards but we wondered if it might show wear after a lot of use: although this might not be an issue as you are only likely to use the feature when going through security or boarding. The case was one of the lightest we tested, a breezy 2.6kg, and had that lovely, smooth Samsonite glide.\n\nBuy now\n\nThule crossover 2 carry on spinner cabin bag: \u00a3320, Thule\n\nDimensions: H55 x W35 x D23cm\n\nCapacity: 36l\n\nWeight: 3.45kg\n\nThule is well known for its snowsports gear, car roof racks and bicycle equipment \u2013 so, as you\u2019d expect, its take on a carry on bag is adventure-ready, feels indestructible (it has a moulded ballistic base) and looks the part. Our favourite feature was the sunglasses case integrated into the front, with a plush lining for the lenses and a stiff, solid wall for protection. We also liked the generous, divided front pocket \u2013 exactly the right size for a tablet or e-reader and a small liquids bag \u2013 and the expansion zip, which gives you a generous extra 6cm of space. It took us a little while to get used to the telescopic handle \u2013 the release buttons are on the side, not the top, which is very intuitive when collapsing the handle but a bit tricky when releasing it.\n\nBuy now\n\nOsprey fairview wheels 36 cabin bag: \u00a3190, Osprey\n\nDimension: H55 x W36 x D23\n\nCapacity: 36l\n\nWeight: 2.4kg\n\nA backpack with wheels, this clever bag by Osprey had everything we were looking for in a convertible case. Based on Osprey\u2019s much-loved Fairview trekking backpack, it\u2019s supremely comfortable to wear, thanks to the suspended mesh back and chest and hip straps. The recessed wheels don\u2019t dig into your back at all, and when you want to wheel the case the straps pack away neatly underneath a panel on the back. We were really impressed by how many backpacking features the bag kept: its tough, water resistant outer and water bottle pockets, for example. It also has a generous front and top pocket for liquids and electrics, and the front unzips completely so you can pack it like a duffel bag. A fantastic, innovative crossover.\n\nBuy now\n\nAway the weekender cabin bag: \u00a3245, Away\n\nDimensions: H55 x W32 x D22cm\n\nCapacity: 38.7l\n\nWeight: 2.2kg\n\nA really classic-looking bag, the weekender looks like it belongs in a sepia-tinged 1930s movie, or casually slung on the back seat of a convertible for a spontaneous summer break. But it\u2019s not just good looking: the canvas outer and leather base feel really durable, and the padded shoulder strap was still comfortable when the bag was fully packed. We loved the external door for the shoe compartment (like a kind of shoe garage), the tucked away laptop sleeve and the accessible side pockets (perfect for liquids and electronics). We were also blown away by the bag\u2019s capacity: as well as three inner pockets, the main compartment felt like it kept going and going \u2013 it boasts a 38.7lcapacity, the same as most cases, but with a sleek profile. A gorgeous alternative to a suitcase.\n\nBuy now\n\nAmerican Tourister soundbox spinner cabin bag: \u00a3119, American Tourister\n\nDimensions: H55 x W40 x D20/23cm\n\nCapacity: 35.5/ 41l\n\nWeight: 2.6kg\n\nWe fell in love with this case because it was vibrantly, luminescently yellow, with an engraved circular pattern on the shell that made it look like it rolled in from the 1960s. That\u2019s not an entirely shallow reason to love it: were you to check it, this bag would be identifiable on the conveyor belt a terminal away. Beneath its glorious exterior is everything you expect from a solid, American Tourister bag: it\u2019s expandable, with twin compartments, both with straps to hold things in place, a mesh divider pocket, and a smooth and easy spin. If yellow isn\u2019t your colour, there are peach, purple, jade and scarlet cases in the range \u2013 all just as eye-catching.\n\nBuy now\n\nOrtlieb duffle cabin bag: \u00a3117.44, CycleStore\n\nDimensions: H53 x W31cm x D22cm\n\nCapacity: 40l\n\nWeight: 986g\n\nOur reviewer cycled around the world with Ortlieb bags, and can vouch for the fact that when they say a bag is waterproof, they mean that you could take a bath with it. So it is with this duffle, beloved of adventurers, kayakers and climbers: the zip is similar to what you get on a wetsuit, and the incredibly tough fabric is pretty much indestructible. It\u2019s comfortable to carry as a duffle, but we found more comfy as a backpack \u2013 the straps separate to let you do this. We loved the handy external pocket (not waterproof) and the hooks that cinch the bag down or let you hang the bag up if you want to. The bag\u2019s undeniably low on frills: there are two internal pockets and one giant compartment, but that said, you won\u2019t care about frills when the bag falls out of your kayak and your laptop survives the dip.\n\nBuy now\n\nGregory proxy 45 cabin bag: \u00a3120, Gregory\n\nA proper trekking backpack that you\u2019d be proud to carry around town or on a business trip. This pack has all the Gregory savvy that makes them the brand of choice for epic adventures like hiking the Pacific Crest Trail \u2013 a wipe-clean, dirt and odour proof compartment for offensive hiking socks, for example \u2013 but with smart features for urban travellers, like the office-style pocket with compartments for pens, notepad and laptop.\n\nBest of all is the smart stowing system for the straps and backpack straps: this is a necessity if you\u2019re checking the bag, but is a nice touch if you\u2019re carrying it on and don\u2019t want buckles trailing all over the overhead compartment. Multiple, padded handles \u2013 on the top, bottom, front and the sides \u2013 make it easy and comfy to carry in minimalist mode. A genuine all-rounder.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Cabin bags\n\nBriggs & Riley's sympatico and Victorinox's lexicon really vied for the top spot, with the former just edging it thanks to the unique compression technology (and our sloppy packing). Away\u2019s weekender is a stylish option if you want a duffle.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
