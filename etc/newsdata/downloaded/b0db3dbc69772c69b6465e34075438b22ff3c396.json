For his part, Baldwin proved himself an ideal roastee, punctuating his laughter with reactionary shots of cocked eyebrows, a dropped jaw, and a mouthed series of increasingly astonished wows.\n\nAn edited version of the Baldwin roast airs September 15 on Comedy Central, but here are the key takeaways.\n\nA Diverse Set of Roasters\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see all the diversity on the stage,\u201d noted Roastmaster Sean Hayes, a Baldwin pal since the latter\u2019s initial 2005 appearance on Will & Grace. \u201cWe have gay, trans, black, Asian, mixed \u2026 I don\u2019t know whether to roast these people or register them to vote.\u201d\n\nPer usual, no subject was off-limits. Participants\u2019 jokes were equalizing, normalizing, and aimed to unite rather than offend. In the tradition of the historic Friars Club, whose motto remains \u201cWe Only Roast the Ones We Love,\u201d dais members came together from disparate backgrounds to foster understanding \u2026 and make Alec Baldwin uncomfortable.\n\nCarolla Combats Cancel Culture\n\nAdam Carolla, podcast juggernaut and veteran roaster since taking on Hugh Hefner in 2001, made damn sure his closing remarks were among the boldest of the evening. \u201cIf I can rant for just one minute here,\u201d he began before nodding to Baldwin. \u201cYou\u2019re a great sport. You have a great sense of humor \u2014 unlike the social-justice warriors who are going to be out there tweeting that all the jokes are problematic. You people can blow me, you pussy fucksticks! This is a goddamn roast! Comedians need a place where they can be offensive without your bullshit fake outrage, you hashtag heroes! You already ruined the Oscars! You\u2019re all woke and no joke! So if you were offended by anything said tonight, please give a reach-around to your emotional-support dog and shut the fuck up! This is our safe space, bitches!\u201d\n\nJeff Ross Ribs Adam Corolla\n\nIn years past, Friars Club Roastmaster General Jeff Ross has taken to the red carpet costumed as Joe Paterno (for Roseanne Barr in 2012), a portly Prince (Rob Lowe, 2016), and Kim Jong-un (Bruce Willis, 2018). His 15th Comedy Central roast found him donning a tasteful azure tux, his only prop an oversize white mug bearing Baldwin\u2019s Glengarry Glen Ross catchphrase \u201cCoffee is for closers.\u201d\n\nIn his traditional cleanup spot, Ross went after both the professional \u2014 \u201cAlec, I saw you in the movie Pearl Harbor, which was worse than the actual Pearl Harbor!\u201d \u2014 and the personal, asking his Greenwich Village neighbor, \u201cI watched you get arrested for pummeling a guy over a parking space. Next time, why don\u2019t you just valet your car and help out your brother\u2019s business?\u201d\n\nRoss also proved himself to be an unparalleled improviser, remarking to Carolla, \u201cYou once said women weren\u2019t funny. Well, they are, and you should have hired some to write your jokes tonight!\u201d\n\nCaitlyn Jenner Caught a Lot of the Jokes Too\n\nIt\u2019s no small secret that as a producer, Ross was dying to bring 69-year-old Caitlyn Jenner onboard in whatever manner she felt most comfortable. The first transgender person to participate in the Comedy Central roasts might have seemed the easiest and most frequent target, but she also had larger goals than simply firing back. (Which she definitely did.) A sampling of the Jenner-directed jokes:\n\nSean Hayes: \u201cCaitlyn, being here tonight is braver than anything you\u2019ve ever done. But don\u2019t worry, any parts you don\u2019t like can be cut \u2026 Give her a big hand, even though she already has two of them.\u201d\n\nNikki Glaser: \u201cCaitlyn Jenner, you\u2019re such an incredible athlete. People forget how fast you once ran away from your first family to be on a reality show \u2026 You\u2019re a Republican, I don\u2019t know why. You\u2019ve already gained control of a woman\u2019s body.\u201d\n\nChris Redd: \u201cCaitlyn, you\u2019re against gay marriage. You voted for Trump. You\u2019re like the Auntie Tom of the trans community.\u201d\n\nBlake Griffin: \u201cCaitlyn completed her gender-reassignment surgery in 2017, finally confirming that no one in that family wants a white dick \u2026 I want to take this moment to publicly thank you. As an athlete, I want to thank you for your bravery. As a human, I want to thank you for the doors you\u2019ve opened. And on behalf of the entire NBA and half the rappers on the Billboard charts, I want to thank you for giving your daughters their daddy issues.\u201d\n\nRobert De Niro: \u201cComedy Central wanted to wait to have Caitlyn on a roast until after her surgery so now they can pay her 20 percent less.\u201d\n\nAlec Baldwin: \u201cCaroline Rhea hasn\u2019t been laid in so long she went through Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s trash looking for dick.\u201d\n\nJeff Ross: \u201cCaitlyn, you supported Donald Trump despite his policies. How could someone who chooses to be a woman vote against a woman\u2019s right to choose? Who did you transition into? Man Coulter? \u2026 You proved tonight that you\u2019re not only a great athlete, you\u2019re also a great sport. You\u2019re an inspiration to Republican transgender Olympic decathlon winners everywhere.\u201d\n\nIn closing, Jenner herself took a moment to get confessional \u2014 and return the favors. \u201cLook, I know some of you hate me just because I\u2019m me. Some of you hate me because of the things I\u2019ve said in the past. Well hey, I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m a person trying to figure out my life, just like everyone else. All I want is for future generations of transgender people to know that if I can find the courage to be who I am, then you can too. If you have a problem with that, then you can suck my dick! If you can find it!\u201d\n\nIreland Baldwin Got Back at Her Dad\n\nComics made cracks about his athletic ability, but basketball player Blake Griffin proved a surprising star. One of his stronger moments came when he described the Baldwin brothers as \u201cthe original Wayans Brothers, if the Wayans brothers said the N-word a lot more.\u201d\n\nYet the sneaky MVP of the evening might have been Ireland Baldwin, who showed up unbeknownst to her father. Like Demi Moore at last year\u2019s Bruce Willis roast, she was in a personal position to say things the professionals couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be here,\u201d she enthused up top. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t even know about it because I haven\u2019t checked my voicemails from my dad for the last, like, 12 years. I actually have a lot in common with the people on this roast because, like them, I don\u2019t really know you that well either.\n\n\u201cA lot of people only know my dad as an angry guy, but he\u2019s more than some lunatic who loses his temper. He also loses Emmys and Oscars and custody of his first-born child, am I right?\n\n\u201cLet me just set the record straight. He was a great dad. I still remember when he would tuck me in and yell me a bedtime story. His favorite: \u2018The Three Little Thoughtless Pigs.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t worry: It ended well, with the two sharing a big, extended hug at the end of it all.\n\nDe Niro Was the Real Headliner\n\nAs Hayes enthused before Baldwin first took the stage, \u201cNow let\u2019s get to the real reason we\u2019re all here tonight: to meet Robert De Niro!\u201d\n\nThe revered Godfather II, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas actor appeared dwarfed in an oversize purple chair and was slightly rambly at the teleprompter, but he unquestionably loomed large over the proceedings. As Jeong put it, \u201cAlec, you weren\u2019t the star of 30 Rock, and with De Niro here, you\u2019re not even the star of your own roast.\u201d\n\nAn extended standing ovation welcomed De Niro to the microphone, where he stood shaking his head in disbelief at his own presence: \u201cI know, I know. What the fuck am I doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here for Alec,\u201d he later admitted, \u201cbut honestly I\u2019m here to teach Chris Redd, Caitlyn Jenner, and Blake Griffin how to fuck black women.\u201d\n\nOn playing Robert Mueller to Baldwin\u2019s 45th president in Saturday Night Live sketches, De Niro followed previous roasters in making his political leanings known: \u201cI have to mention Alec\u2019s great portrayal of Donald Trump on SNL. He fucking nails it, exposing Trump for the ridiculous, malignant, narcissist bully sociopath he is.\u201d Waiting for the applause break to die down, he returned the focus to his friend the roastee. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, though, because Alec doesn\u2019t even have to act to do that.\u201d\n\nOf course, it was Baldwin who got the final say at the end of the night. \u201cI love all of you,\u201d he told his roasters. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t believe me, just check your voicemails.\u201d", "description": "Alec Baldwin\u2019s Comedy Central roast included appearances by Robert De Niro, Caitlyn Jenner, Nikki Glaser, Adam Carolla, Chris Redd, Caroline Rhea, Ken Jeong, and Blake Griffin.", "authors": ["Julie Seabaugh"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/09/09-alec-baldwin-roast.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
