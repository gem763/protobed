USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Natasha Romanoff is heading into the holidays with one less secret to keep.\n\nScarlett Johansson, fresh off wrapping her \"Black Widow\" standalone film, acknowledges that not talking about the highly anticipated movie, especially over the past year, took a toll.\n\n\"I\u2019m not a guarded, secretive person by nature anyway,\" the jet-lagged star tells USA TODAY, having recently flown back to the States from the months-long shoot in London.\n\nSo when journalists and fans probed for details about the \"Black Widow\" film, which Disney had yet to confirm, the actress found herself experiencing \"a strange phenomenon of feeling kind of guilty \u2026 like you\u2019re doing something wrong \u2013 I felt like I was having an affair or something and everyone suspected it,\" she laughs.\n\nThe cat was finally out of the bag at San Diego Comic-Con in July, when Johansson joined director Cate Shortland (\"Lore\") and revealed \"Black Widow\" will hit theaters May 1, kicking off Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nBrie Larson: Marvel women are 'passionate' about a potential all-female superhero movie\n\nThough Natasha famously found her end during \"Avengers: Endgame,\" the solo film, which also stars Rachel Weisz and David Harbour, will be set after the events of 2016\u2019s \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201d\n\nAfter eight years of hashing out a \"Black Widow\" film with Marvel, Johansson says the experience \"was more than I ever could have hoped for.\"\n\nSeen here in \"Captain America: Civil War,\" Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) engages with other women who've gone through the Red Room assassin program in \"Black Widow.\" (Photo: MARVEL STUDIOS)\n\n\"The film deals with real, complicated stuff,\" she says, calling her Black Widow \"a character that has a lot of shame. And maybe in some weird, roundabout way, maybe some of the feelings I had going into this were actually some of her unprocessed feelings that I got to work through while making this film.\n\n\"She\u2019s a woman whose narrative has been created for her in a lot of ways and the path that has been laid before her is not one that she\u2019s necessarily paved herself.\"\n\nJohansson is no stranger to the feeling.\n\n\"I have felt that way at times in my life and in my career. I think every woman has struggled with what is expected of them,\" she says.\n\nAt Comic-Con, Marvel showed a \"Black Widow\" trailer to the crowd that offered a glimpse at the ballet company/Black Widow program that trained Russian girls to be super-assassins, along with a \"John Wick\"-esque fight between Johansson\u2019s Natasha Romanoff and her \"sister\" Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) that involved guns, knives and a shower curtain, plus a throwdown between Natasha and debuting supervillain Taskmaster.\n\n\"I hope the movie reflects the feeling I had making it,\" says Johansson, who next stars in \"Jojo Rabbit,\" which hits theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles (expanding through October and November). \"But now it\u2019s a little bit out of my hands. I\u2019m producing it so I\u2019m able to see it as it gets put together but it\u2019s all in Cate\u2019s hands now. She\u2019ll find the truth of it.\"\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/15/scarlett-johansson-says-black-widow-secret-felt-like-affair/3981674002/", "description": "Scarlett Johansson admits that not talking about her highly anticipated Marvel 'Black Widow' solo movie\u00a0(in theaters May 1, 2020) took its toll.", "authors": ["Andrea Mandell", "Published P.M.
