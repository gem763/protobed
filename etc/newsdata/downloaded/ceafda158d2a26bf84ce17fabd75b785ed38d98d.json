His team has sought to project a business-as-usual tone, with two of his campaign co-chairs, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz of San Juan, Puerto Rico, stumping for Sanders over the weekend in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSanders\u2019 platform against corporate money also puts a spotlight on the candidate\u2019s fundraising operation, which is powered almost exclusively by small-dollar donors. Sanders raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of the year, more than any other Democratic presidential candidate, but that news has been subsumed somewhat by his health scare.\n\nIn addition to trying to change the way the convention is funded, Sanders\u2019 plan also seeks to bar corporate contributions for inaugural events and limit individual donations to $500 apiece.\n\nSanders\u2019 policy puts the DNC in a difficult situation, and could potentially reignite tensions between the party organization and his campaign. DNC officials went to K Street last month to explain how corporations could contribute to the 2020 convention, which will be held in Milwaukee. Some lobbyists have been concerned that a candidate such as Sanders or Elizabeth Warren may try to halt corporate donations if they receive the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nConvention CEO Joe Solmonese said at the time that the DNC is not expecting to return any contributions, no matter who wins the primary. It is unclear how the Sanders team would address such a situation, or what would happen during a brokered convention, but the campaign is adamant that it would not allow any corporate funding for the event.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders fights for the people, cannot be bought and is under no obligation to fulfill any transaction with a corporation trying to corruptly buy access,\u201d said Josh Orton, Sanders\u2019 national policy director. \u201cA Bernie Sanders convention will be a people-powered convention.\u201d\n\nSanders also vows in his proposal to try to pass a constitutional amendment \u201cthat makes clear that money is not speech and corporations are not people,\u201d and replace what his campaign calls the \u201cworthless\u201d Federal Election Commission with a Federal Election Administration proposed by former Sens. John McCain and Russ Feingold. He wants to pass public-financing laws for all federal elections, and allow voters to use \u201cuniversal small-dollar vouchers\u201d to donate to candidates as well. Several of Sanders\u2019 proposals would require congressional approval.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/65/07/5e7fe2a74dfcb2ae559f74a09bfb/20191006-bernie-sanders-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
