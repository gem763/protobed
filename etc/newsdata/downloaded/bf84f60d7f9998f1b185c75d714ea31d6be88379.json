(AP Photo/Alastair Grant)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the death of 39 people found in a truck container in southeastern England (all times local):\n\n3:30 a.m.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in London says the nationalities of the 39 people found dead in a container truck in England have not been confirmed, appearing to contradict a police statement that they were Chinese.\n\nA statement dated Friday on the embassy website said police are verifying the identity of the victims and their nationality still cannot be confirmed.\n\nThe bodies of 31 men and eight women were found Wednesday in a truck near a port in southeastern England. British police said they were Chinese.\n\nThe Chinese embassy said it had sent a team to the site and that the officials had met with local police.\n\n___\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nBritish detectives investigating the deaths of 39 people found in a refrigerated truck in southeastern England have been given an additional 24 hours to question the driver on suspicion of murder.\n\nThe 25-year-old truck driver from Northern Ireland has not been charged in the tragedy.\n\nPolice say in a statement Thursday that the recovery of the bodies, all Chinese citizens, is ongoing and that the post-mortem and identification process will take time.\n\nThey are getting assistance from Chinese embassy officials in London and police in Belgium, where the truck's container apparently was put on a ferry at the port of Zeebrugge and sent to England.\n\nA book of condolences has been placed at the town office in Grays, the site of the industrial park where the truck containing the bodies was found early Wednesday.\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nBelgian authorities say they have yet to make headway in finding out how a container with 39 Chinese citizens ended up in their port of Zeebrugge before it was discovered in England with all stowaways dead.\n\nProsecution spokesman Eric Van Duyse said Thursday that \"up till now, we have a lot of questions and not a lot of answers. We don't even know which road was followed by the truck in Belgium.\"\n\nAmong the other outstanding questions on the truck container, Van Duyse said \"we don't know how much time it stayed in Belgian territory. We don't know if it stopped or not. We don't know if the people got into the container or not.\"\n\nVan Duyse said the next step for Belgian authorities is cooperating with British police on the investigation.\n\nThe Essex Police force says the dead found Wednesday in the southeastern English town of Grays included 31 men and eight women, all Chinese.\n\n___\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nBritish police have confirmed that 39 people found dead in a container truck near an English port were Chinese citizens.\n\nThe Essex Police force says the dead found Wednesday in the southeastern town of Grays included 31 men and eight women. The force says one victim previously thought to be a teenager was a young adult woman.\n\nThe 25-year-old truck driver, who is from Northern Ireland, is being questioned on suspicion of attempted murder but has not been charged. Police in Northern Ireland have searched three properties there as they try to reconstruct the path of the truck and the victims' final journey.\n\n___\n\n11:05 a.m.\n\nBritish media are reporting that the 39 people found dead in the back of a truck in southeastern England were Chinese citizens.\n\nBritain's Press Association cited sources in its report Thursday. The BBC, ITV and Sky also cited sources in releasing the same information.\n\nBritish police on Thursday also raided two sites in Northern Ireland and questioned a truck driver as officers investigate the death of the 38 adults and one teenager. The victims were found Wednesday in a truck container at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, a town 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of London.\n\n____\n\n10:05 a.m.\n\nThe Belgian federal prosecutor's office says it is clear that the container in which 39 people were found dead had come through the North Sea port of Zeebrugge.\n\nIn a statement, the office said the container was only a short time at the port before it went across the sea to the English town of Purfleet, 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of London.\n\nThe statement said it appears the container arrived in Zeebrugge on Oct. 22 at 2:49 p.m. local time (1249 GMT), and \"left the port the same day in the afternoon.\"\n\nCooling containers often move swiftly through Zeebrugge, often just with a visual check, for the short crossing to England.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Chinese Embassy in London says the nationalities of the 39 people found dead in a container truck in England have not been confirmed, appearing to contradict a police statement that they were Chinese.
