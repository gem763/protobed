This all sounds like the perfect setup for another political SNL cold open, but last night\u2019s episode opened with a sketch about CNN\u2019s LGBTQ town hall instead, so the Giuliani sketch landed in the \u201cCut for Time\u201d bin.\n\nIn the commercial parody for \u201cGiuliani & Associates,\u201d Kate McKinnon brings back her Giuliani (a.k.a. \u201cPizza Rat Senior\u201d) to star in an ad alongside Parnas (Beck Bennett) and Fruman (David Harbour) marketed for a very specific potential client: \u201cWere you the victim of a crime you committed? Are you facing serious legal trouble? And do you want to make it worse?\u201d Whether it\u2019s fraud, bribery, conspiracy, money laundering, or even treason, Giuliani promises that they\u2019ve \u201cdone it all, which means we know how to get you out of it!\u201d And, of course, by \u201cout of it,\u201d they mean you\u2019re definitely going to jail. Definitely.", "description": "On \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 host David Harbour and Beck Bennett join Kate McKinnon in an ad for Rudy Giuliani\u2019s law firm, \u201cGiuliani & Associates.\u201d", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/12/snl-mckinnon-harbour-giuliani.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
