But some are still reliant on coal for the majority of their power generation, such as Poland.\n\nMany coal plant operators say coal will be needed for decades to provide stable energy supplies because renewable energy is intermittent.\n\nCarbon Tracker analysed the operating economics of every coal plant in the EU.\n\nIt found that hard coal generation, which has the highest carbon content, had fallen 39% this year from a year earlier.\n\nSome 84% of lignite generation, which also has a high carbon content, and 76% of hard coal generation, is unprofitable, resulting in losses of 3.54 billion and 3.03 billion euros respectively.\n\nAcross the EU, 79% of coal plants are running at a loss.\n\n\"EU coal generators are haemorrhaging cash because they cannot compete with cheap renewables and gas and this will only get worse. Policymakers and investors should prepare to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest,\" said Carbon Tracker's Matt Gray, co-author of the report.\n\nGerman utility RWE faces the biggest losses this year of 975 million euros, which is 6% of its market capitalisation, according to the report.\n\nCentral European energy group EPH, which has assets mainly in Germany and the Czech Republic, could lose 613 million euros, and PPC in Greece could lose 596 million euros, it said.\n\nCoal plants that will continue to turn a profit include those in Poland, which receive quite high subsidies, efficient units in Germany and the Netherlands and some plants in Italy, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, which benefit from high wholesale power prices, the report said.", "description": "Four in five EU coal plants are unprofitable: research", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9M26A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
