They could sense it, sometimes, through little things in an opponent\u2019s body language before a game or a disparaging comment during it. Although they took a single point from their attempt to reach Russia 2018, their performances against teams such as Croatia, Iceland, Ukraine and Turkey had merited more; the belief inside the dressing room was that they were not far off and if outsiders wanted to patronise them they had been through enough not to care.\n\nThey were right. Kosovo arrive in Southampton unbeaten in 15 games, fresh from a pulsating 2-1 win over the Czech Republic and with genuine hopes of reaching the European Championship at the first time of asking. It is the most exciting story on the continent\u2019s international scene; a tale of how a nation that declared independence in 2008, and did not join Uefa or Fifa until May 2016, has been able to express itself through a team whose possibilities currently appear limitless.\n\nSouthgate offers Declan Rice support over social media threats and abuse Read more\n\n\u201cThe dream keeps going,\u201d Samir Ujkani, the captain and long-serving goalkeeper, says. Few have lived that dream more intensely than him. On a filthy day in March 2014 he stood in a bog of a goalmouth in Mitrovica, a city in the north of Kosovo, as a hastily assembled Kosovo side prepared to face Haiti in their first Fifa-sanctioned friendly and could not keep the tears from his eyes.\n\nTwo and a half years later, after an unbearably tense wait in a hotel lobby in Turku, the emotions bubbled up again as he and five teammates were cleared to play in Kosovo\u2019s competitive debut against Finlan a matter of hours before kick-off.\n\n\u201cI thought it would take four to six years for us to be ready but now, after three, we\u2019re already living these fantastic achievements,\u201d says Ujkani, who played 20 times for Albania before Kosovo were given permission to play official games. \u201cIf we can make [qualification] a reality then it\u2019s incredible, but the main thing is that we are a team that wants to grow and make the future beautiful for our country.\u201d\n\nThat is exactly what drives Kosovo\u2019s players, whose attacking, technical approach is underpinned by a ferocious intensity rarely seen on this stage. \u201cMe, my teammates and all the staff, are ready to die on the field,\u201d the centre-forward, Vedat Muriqi, said after Saturday\u2019s victory, in which he scored Kosovo\u2019s equaliser. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to give 1,000% for this shirt and for this country.\u201d\n\nIn other places words like that, offered breathlessly to the television cameras within minutes of a famous result, would be passed off as hyperbole. For Kosovo they are a mantra to live by. These are, as their Swiss coach, Bernard Challandes, said after the win against Bulgaria in June, \u201cnot like other players\u201d.\n\nEvery Kosovan has their story of what happened to family, friends or themselves during the brutal war against Serbian forces in the late 1990s. During that decade the ethnic Albanian majority of the population had to play in secret, wild locations. Memories of the past, many of them horrifying, motivate the shaping of a hopeful future.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nMany of the Kosovans at St Mary\u2019s on Tuesday count themselves among the war diaspora or are descended from those who do. The 2011 census recorded almost 30,000 Kosovan-born residents in the UK and the squad have been inundated with requests for tickets. Almost half the players were born in other European countries to parents who had, under differing degrees of stress, left Kosovo for a better life. Some have described emotional tugs of war between the country of their heart and the nation that developed them as a player. Thanks largely to the exhaustive efforts of the much\u2011loved Football Federation of Kosovo president, Fadil Vokrri, who died last year, their general secretary, Eroll Salihu, and the previous manager, Albert Bunjaki, those tussles nowadays tend to end in Kosovo\u2019s favour.\n\nUjkani admits that, before the Czechs visited Pristina, he \u201cwould have signed directly for a draw\u201d. Kosovo lacked five of their most important players and will do so against England. The key wingers, Arber Zeneli and Milot Rashica, are injured; so are the midfielders Hekuran Kryeziu and Herolind Shala, as well as the left-back Benjamin Kololli. But England must handle Muriqi, a gladiator of a striker who is on flying form for Fenerbahce, as well as the Swansea playmaker Bersant Celina and Lazio\u2019s Valon Berisha. The Manchester City keeper Aro Muric will probably keep Ujkani out of a team whose likely starters are almost all 25 or under.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just important to try and play our football against this big, big team and have fun,\u201d Ujkani says.\n\nKosovo\u2019s default setting is to play a risky, front-footed game and that is unlikely to change now. \u201cOur idea was to create this young group with many talents and they are becoming men now.\u201d\n\nEven if the dream does suffer a minor jolt, Kosovo are here to stay.", "description": "Kosovo\u2019s exciting team that has grown up quickly has more than just possible Euro 2020 qualification as motivation", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f00aafa6620d2f2a3ef4633fccba4b0972184fea/101_98_3353_2012/master/3353.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=318cb402ab6e06aebf218449406682c8", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
