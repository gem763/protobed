Expectant mom Emilie Haskell explained that she is five months pregnant with her first child and 'starting to get a little bit nervous about labor.'\n\n'I think it is the most romantic day you\u2019ll ever experience,' said Jennifer, who shares a son Samuel, seven, and daughters Seraphina, 10, and Violet, 13, with her ex-husband Ben Affleck.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nDishing: Jennifer Garner (left) sat down with Kristen Bell (right) and three other moms to talk about parenting in the season four premiere of Momsplaining with Kristen Bell\n\nShe knows! When an expectant mom named Emilie admitted she's starting to get 'nervous' about going into labor, Jennifer assured her 'it is the most romantic day you'll ever experience'\n\nKeeping it (very) real: Kristen, however, said 'it's gonna look like a homicide' with lots of blood\n\nKristen, who has daughters Delta, four, and Lincoln, six, with her husband Dax Shepard, had a much different take.\n\n'You\u2019re a better person than I am because I was gonna say, \"It\u2019s gonna look like a homicide,\"' she admitted. 'There is way more blood than you think there should be.'\n\nThe Good Place star went on to advise Emilie to throw away her birth plan 'because it's never going to happen like that.'\n\nKristen recounted being pregnant with her first daughter Lincoln and calling her doctor because she thought her water had broke.\n\nLooking for advice: Moms Megan Safar, Deanna Clower, and Emilie Haskell (left to right) all had different questions for the actresses\n\nCandid: Kristen advised expectant moms to throw away their birth plans 'because it's never going to happen like that'\n\n'She gets me on the examination table. She goes, \"Huh? So you said your water broke?\" And I said, \"Yeah, definitely. It was a big splash on my bathroom floor,\"' she explained. 'And she goes, \"OK. Your water didn't break, but it's quite possible you peed your pants.\"'\n\nAnother mom in the group, Deanna Clower, said she is on maternity leave after giving birth to a three-month-old baby, and she wanted to know when she would start feeling like herself again.\n\n'The answer\u2019s never. You\u2019re not gonna,' Kristen said, as Jennifer shook her head in agreement. 'Because you\u2019re a different self. And it\u2019s important to talk to others. Momming is hard, but it\u2019s worth it.'\n\nThe actresses also gave advice to Megan Safar, a mom who has a three-year-old and a four-year-old who are just 11 months apart.\n\nSupport system: Kristen's husband Dax Shepard is pictured giving her a back rub while she was in labor with their daughter Delta, who is now four\n\nFamily: The couple also has a six-year-old daughter named Lincoln.

She is pictured with her kids in August 2018\n\nShe wanted to know how to handle her children's tantrums, admitting to Kristen that calling them by their full names just doesn't work.\n\n'You have to just be like, \u2018Can you believe this little s**t is having a tantrum?' Jennifer advised as the women laughed. 'I would say that is the mindset.'\n\nKristen, meanwhile, revealed her husband Dax has a surefire approach for handling their daughters' temper tantrums that she has found to be helpful.\n\n'He says, \"Sometimes when they\u2019re having a tantrum, treat 'em like the hot girl in high school: Just ignore 'em and then they\u2019ll come to you,\"' she shared. 'I thought that was so silly when he said it, and then it actually works.'", "description": "Jennifer, 47, sat down with Kristen, 39, and three other moms to talk about parenting in the\u00a0season four premiere of Momsplaining with Kristen Bell.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/23/20010500-0-image-a-15_1571695744193.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
