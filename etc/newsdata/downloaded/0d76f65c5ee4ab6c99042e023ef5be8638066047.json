Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee. He compared the latest allegations to claims that Trump worked with Russia to win in 2016. \u201cThis seems to be the same kind of deal.\u201d\n\nThe GOP\u2019s nonchalance even extended to the decision by acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire not to share the complaint with Congress, though the law says explicitly that national security matters deemed \u201curgent\u201d should be shared with intelligence committees on Capitol Hill.\n\nCongressional Republicans repeatedly used their oversight authority to investigate Democratic administrations, demanding documents and witnesses from previous White Houses. Republicans, for the most part, wouldn\u2019t demand the complaint\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cIt would have a real chilling effect on dialogue between important leaders if they think that every time someone who overhears a conversation that wasn\u2019t even party to the conversation is going to file a whistleblower complaint and it\u2019ll end up on the front page of periodicals across the country,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump\u2019s closest allies.\n\nThe move by the administration to keep the complaint from Congress is just the latest in a months-long effort by the Trump administration to stonewall all congressional investigations related to the president. Legal experts say the pattern has undercut the separation of powers and could erode Congress\u2019s authority in the future.\n\nThe GOP response reflects the party\u2019s go-to posture whenever the president has been awash in controversy. Republicans are loath to speak out against the president, who is extremely popular with their base. Those who do often face criticism from voters back home and an angry tweet from Trump; some have lost primaries to Trump-favored candidates.\n\nA few Republicans did express concerns as details emerged, but they were reluctant to criticize the president or even suggest Trump had done anything wrong.\n\n\u201cI think it would be wildly inappropriate for an American president to invite a foreign country\u2019s leader to get engaged in an American presidential election. That strikes me as entirely inappropriate,\u201d said Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) in a telephone interview.\n\nBut Toomey called back later to clarify: \u201cI\u2019m not acknowledging or alleging the president did that. I have no idea what the president said to anybody. I\u2019m just making a general point.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump went on the attack against the whistleblower, writing in a tweet that the unnamed individual was \u201chighly partisan.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported Wednesday that Trump\u2019s interactions with the foreign leader included a \u201cpromise\u201d that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an unidentified U.S. intelligence official to file a whistleblower complaint in mid-August with the inspector general for the intelligence community. The Post reported late Thursday that the complaint centers on Ukraine.\n\nTrump declines to say whether he discussed Joe Biden in call with Ukrainian president\n\nWeeks before the complaint was made, Trump spoke with Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a call already under scrutiny by House Democrats examining whether Trump and his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani sought to manipulate the Ukrainian government into helping the president\u2019s reelection efforts.\n\nTrump has denied doing anything improper. But during a CNN appearance Thursday night, Giuliani admitted that he spoke with Ukrainian officials about reopening an investigation Republicans think will make former vice president Joe Biden look bad. Biden leads in polls of the Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nLate Friday, The Post reported that Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s son in a call between the two leaders that is at the center of the complaint, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump pressed Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden\u2019s son, according to people familiar with the matter\n\nOn Friday, many Republicans wouldn\u2019t even say if it would be inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign government to investigate a political adversary. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) wouldn\u2019t answer the question. Neither would senior Intelligence Committee member K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a chance that he was misquoted,\u201d Conaway said when a reporter told him that Giuliani argued on TV Thursday night that the president has a right to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political adversary.\n\nAsked if such actions were okay, generally, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can make a blanket statement one way or the other.\u201d\n\nEven Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who occasionally speaks out against Trump, was fairly reserved when asked about the matter: \u201cIn theory, no U.S. instrument of power in foreign policy or otherwise can be used to affect an election. . . . That said, all these stories, about 90 percent of them, end up far different than what it is the first couple days. I think we\u2019ll know more on Monday. I just think this is all new and we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nMost Republicans also dodged questions when asked whether Congress should see the report at all. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of Senate GOP leadership who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, refused to answer repeated questions about the reports or whether he thought it was improper for the acting director of national intelligence to block a whistleblower from coming to Congress.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. . . . Maybe next week.\u201d\n\nNewly elected Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) took the same tack, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about it to register opinion.\u201d When asked whether Congress should see the complaint to learn more, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said: \u201cNo not necessarily . . . . I\u2019m not going to get into that.\u201d\n\nEven Jordan, who helped lead the House GOP\u2019s investigation of the 2013 IRS controversy and the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, said he\u2019d leave it to the administration to decide what Congress gets: \u201cThat\u2019s up to the president, and the president\u2019s got to look at what\u2019s in the best interest of the United States. He\u2019s got to look at the big picture, and I trust him to do that.\u201d\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), a former Marine who worked in intelligence, seemed torn. On the one hand, he said, \u201cthe fact is, the president, to quote [famous former Rep.] John Marshall, is the \u2018sole organ\u2019 of U.S. external relations and has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut on the other hand, \u201cI\u2019m in favor of transparency,\u201d he added: \u201cSo if, as the White House claims, there\u2019s no \u2018there\u2019 there, then probably the best way to dispel all of these Schiff-instigated rumors is to allow the report to go to the requisite national security committees.\u201d\n\nThere was one exception to the nearly unified GOP response: Rep. Chris Stewart (Utah), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that he was not only \u201cconcerned\u201d that Congress had not received the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, but he thought it was possible Republicans would join Schiff in subpoenaing the records if Maguire continues to deny them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible. I think we probably would. To be clear: I don\u2019t know yet. But I\u2019m telling you that it\u2019s certainly on the table,\u201d he said of Republicans joining in a subpoena. \u201cAnd when I say that I want to protect congressional oversight, I really mean that, so I think we have to resolve this.\u201d\n\nStewart, like Democrats, has argued that the whistleblower followed the process, intending for his complaint to reach lawmakers.\n\nBut McCarthy challenged that presumption Friday, arguing that, \u201cif they wanted it to go to Congress, they could have come directly to Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know who the whistleblower is, what are they saying \u2014 but they could have come to Congress and given it to us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s channels to come directly to Congress, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s argument would seem to isolate the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, who wrote to the congressional intelligence committees more than once this month to alert them to the existence of the complaint and the fact that Maguire was refusing to transfer it to Congress, despite his assessment it was both \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, said McCarthy was wrong and the whistleblower would not have been authorized to share classified information with Congress. The individual could face criminal charges if he contacted lawmakers.\n\nColby Itkowitz contributed to this report.", "description": "GOP lawmakers who repeatedly demanded documents and witnesses from Democratic administrations back the Trump administration\u2019s decision not to share complaint with Congress.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G5D6YXG35YI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
