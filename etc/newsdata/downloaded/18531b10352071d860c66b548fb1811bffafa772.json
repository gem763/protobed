In 1999, Salman Rushdie named him the runner-up for \u201cInternational moron of the year\u201d in the Guardian, for his \u201cseries of impassioned apologias for the genocidal regime of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u201d. (The winner was actor Charlton Heston, for being a gun lobbyist.)\n\nThe Austrian playwright, whose Slovenian heritage had inspired in him a fervent nationalism during the Balkans war, had publicly suggested that Sarajevo\u2019s Muslims had massacred themselves and blamed the Serbs, and denied the Srebrenica genocide. Seven years after Rushdie\u2019s scorching condemnation, in 2006, he would also attend war criminal Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s funeral.\n\nOn Thursday, after the announcement of Handke\u2019s win of the 9m Swedish krona prize (\u00a3786,000), Rushdie told the Guardian: \u201cI have nothing to add today, but I stand by what I wrote then.\u201d\n\nThe decision to award Handke the 2019 laureateship \u2013 alongside Poland\u2019s Olga Tokarczuk for the 2018 medal \u2013 was widely criticised by observers as a broken promise on two fronts.\n\nFirst, the Swedish Academy\u2019s apparent commitment to be less \u201cmale-oriented\u201d and \u201cEurocentric\u201d just days before had been quickly proven false, with two European winners and only the 15th female laureate in 120 years. Secondly, having declared that the prize would take a fallow year to reassess its direction after a now infamous sexual harassment scandal, the academy had left observers hopeful that the Nobel would stop eliding controversy with intellectual rigour, and choose authors that could be praised for both their work and their politics.\n\nMore than ever we need public intellectuals who are able to make a robust defence of human rights ... Handke is not such a person Hari Kunzru\n\n\u201cHandke is a troubling choice for a Nobel committee that is trying to put the prize on track after recent scandals,\u201d said author Hari Kunzru, who has taught the laureate\u2019s work to his students. \u201cHe is a fine writer, who combines great insight with shocking ethical blindness.\u201d\n\nKunzru said he believed that Handke would have won the Nobel earlier, \u201chad he not decided to act as a propagandist for the genocidal Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime\u201d. He added: \u201cMore than ever we need public intellectuals who are able to make a robust defence of human rights in the face of the indifference and cynicism of our political leaders. Handke is not such a person.\u201d\n\nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek, Slovenian philosopher and longtime critic of Handke, told the Guardian: \u201cIn 2014, Handke called for the Nobel to be abolished, saying it was a \u2018false canonisation\u2019 of literature. The fact that he got it now proves that he was right. This is Sweden today: an apologist of war crimes gets a Nobel prize while the country fully participated in the character assassination of the true hero of our times, Julian Assange. Our reaction should be: not the literature Nobel prize for Handke but the Nobel peace prize for Assange.\u201d\n\nSlovenian author Miha Mazzini said: \u201cSome artists sold their human souls for ideologies (Hamsun and Nazism), some for hate (Celine and his rabid antisemitism), some for money and power (Kusturica) but the one that offended me the most was Handke with his naivety for the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime. And it\u2019s personal. I will never forget the cold winter when Yugoslavia was falling apart and there was nothing on the shelves of the stores. We were a young family and my daughter was a toddler and it was bitterly cold. I\u2019d spent the whole day in the queue for the heating oil and in the evening, almost frozen, I started reading Handke\u2019s essay about Yugoslavia. He wrote of how he envied me: while those Austrians and Germans, those westerners, had fallen for consumerism, we, Yugoslavs, had to queue and fight for everything. Oh, how close to the nature we were! How less materialistic and more spiritualised we were! Even at the time, I found him cruel and totally self-absorbed in his naivety.\u201d\n\nHandke\u2019s politics have long been derided by former friends and authors. In 2008, novelist Jonathan Littell remarked: \u201cHe might be a fantastic artist, but as a human being he is my enemy \u2026 he\u2019s an asshole.\u201d Alain Finkielkraut called him \u201can ideological monster\u201d, while Susan Sontag, who spent several months in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war staging a performance of Waiting for Godot, said Handke\u2019s comments had \u201cfinished\u201d him among his former friends in New York.\n\nDr Helen Finch, associate professor in German at the University of Leeds, praised Handke\u2019s ability to explore \u201cthe fringes of human experience in an extraordinary way and for his \u201cearly and complex form of ecopoetics\u201d, but said his Nobel win \u201cshows that the prize committee is still infatuated by white European men writing in an elitist poetic tradition, and is cloth-eared to the political complicity of those men\u201d.\n\nSome were pleased by Handke\u2019s win, however: Serbian media lined up to praise the decision, calling Handke a \u201cgreat friend\u201d, while Austrian president Alexander Van der Bellen called Handke\u2019s voice \u201cunfussy and unique \u2026 We have a lot to thank Peter Handke for. I hope he knows that.\u201d", "description": "Writers including Salman Rushdie, Hari Kunzru and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek say the 2019 Nobel laureate \u2018combines great insight with shocking ethical blindness\u2019", "authors": ["Sian Cain"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf4ee44698c4d8c45430cd132a2c978a7101916a/0_47_5310_3186/master/5310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eb4f8991860350801ecdde1d1702cd29", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
