The couple had allegedly been arguing about infidelity, according to a police report first obtained by FoxSanAntonio.com.\n\nReyes Gallegos told authorities that his wife had run away and not returned. He allegedly claimed to not know her whereabouts.\n\nBut now police allege that the Reyes Gallegos knows more than he\u2019s saying. They arrested the 34-year-old man last Wednesday and charged him with making a false police report, a Class B misdemeanor. PEOPLE confirms that he posted $3,500 bond and was released the following day.\n\nReyes Gallegos was also charged with assault causing bodily injury in a separate incident that occurred about two weeks before his wife went missing, MySanAntonio reports. The alleged victim in that case is unknown.\n\nAccording to the recent arrest affidavit which was obtained by the San Antonio Express News, police viewed cameras placed inside and outside the couple\u2019s home. They allegedly showed inconsistencies in Gallegos\u2019 story.\n\nInvestigators say the cameras show Cecilia walking into the bedroom she shared with Gallegos on July 7. She never appeared to emerge from the room.\n\nBexar County Sheriff's Office More\n\n\u201cAfter she enters this room she is never seen again on surveillance footage,\u201d the affidavit reportedly states. \u201cFour kids were in the home during this time and the suspect is seen keeping the children away from the bedroom that the wife was in.\u201d\n\ninvestigators allege that Gallegos turned off his surveillance system for nearly two hours the following morning.\n\n\u201cWhen video resumes, the suspect is seen going in and out of the bedroom and moving about the house, during this time the children are in their bedrooms,\u201d the report alleges, according to San Antonio Express News.\n\nThe affidavit reportedly continues that Gallegos left the house several times in his SUV, and was spotted \u201cunloading two shovels and a chainsaw,\u201d in addition to cleaning supplies and trash bags.\n\n\u201cThe suspect\u2019s shirt that he was wearing appeared to be wet with sweat,\u201d the report claims.\n\nThe video then allegedly shows Gallegos taking a shower before calling police.\n\nPolice say that Cecilia Gallegos hasn\u2019t used her credit cards since she vanished. Her family says she would never have left her children. (She had four kids: two with Reyes Gallegos, and two from a previous relationship.)\n\nHer sister, Mireya Lopez, tells KSAT that Cecilia called family members to warn them that something bad might happen to her \u2014 and they now believe she is dead. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to accept it,\u201d Lopez says, \u201cbut our hearts tell us she\u2019s no longer with us.\u201d", "description": "Tx.
