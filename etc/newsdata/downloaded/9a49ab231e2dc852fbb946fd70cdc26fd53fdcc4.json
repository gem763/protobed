REUTERS/Loren Elliott (Loren Elliott/Reuters)\n\nHundreds of Hurricane Dorian survivors crowded into a ferry anchored in Freeport, Bahamas on Sunday evening, after days on the sweltering islands with limited food, water and power. Just two-and-a-half hours across the ocean, safety and relief waited in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Then, an announcement blared from the boat\u2019s intercom speakers.\n\n\u201cPlease, all passengers that don\u2019t have a U.S. visa, please proceed to disembark,\u201d a crew member barked in video captured on board.\n\nSince Dorian devastated the islands earlier this month, killing at least 44, hundreds of other refugees have reportedly come to the U.S. after going through a screening process with only a passport and proof of a clean criminal record. The more than 100 refugees forced to disembark Sunday night were baffled at why they had been turned away.\n\n\u201cAt the last minute like this, it\u2019s kind of disappointing,\u201d Renard Oliver, who held his infant daughter, told Brian Entin, a reporter for Miami TV station WSVN. \u201cIt\u2019s hurtful because I\u2019m watching my daughter cry, but it is what it is.\u201d\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection, however, says no rules have changed and laid the blame on the ferry operator, identified by local reporters as Balearia Caribbean, for not properly coordinating with government officials. Balearia Caribbean did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\u201cCBP was notified of a vessel preparing to embark an unknown number of passengers in Freeport and requested that the operator of the vessel coordinate with U.S. and Bahamian government officials in Nassau before departing The Bahamas,\u201d the agency said in a statement shared with The Washington Post late on Sunday.\n\nA CBP official in Florida told WSVN that it was a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d by Balearia to remove the refugees without visas.\n\n\u201cIf those folks did stay on the boat and arrived, we would have processed them, vetted them and worked within our laws and protocols and done what we had to do to facilitate them,\u201d a CBP spokesman said. \u201cThey were not ordered off the boat by any U.S. government entity.\u201d\n\nJust interviewed @CBPFlorida when we got off ferry in FL. They say they would have accepted and processed the Bahamians, and blame the ferry company Balearia. CBP says they tried to coordinate with Balearia but company \"made a business decision\" to take the evacuees off the boat. pic.twitter.com/ONkgdcJvS3 \u2014 Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) September 9, 2019\n\nOn Saturday, nearly 1,500 refugees traveled to the U.S. in another cruise ship, reportedly without requiring visas. Entin reported that the crew on the Sunday ferry were told the same rules were in effect before being rebuffed by CBP.\n\nA little more from crew on the ferry. They say they were told it was ok to accept Bahamian evacuees with passport and copy of police record. They boarded boat. Then when they sent manifest to US Customs and Border Patrol \u2014 they were told those without visas would not be accepted. \u2014 Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) September 9, 2019\n\nThe refugees\u2019 plight comes after bipartisan calls to waive all visa requirements for Bahamas survivors. On Wednesday, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R) and Sen. Rick Scott (R) wrote an open letter to President Donald Trump urging him to allow in refugees with family in the U.S. Eighteen other Florida lawmakers made a similar appeal.\n\n\u201cIncoming images and media reports indicate that thousands of homes have been destroyed and the basic infrastructure of many communities simply no longer exists,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201c[P]erhaps one of the most basic yet meaningful steps our government can take immediately is to ensure that those who have lost everything, including family members in some instances, are provided the opportunity for shelter and reunification with family in the United States.\u201d\n\nJust hours before the confusion on Sunday\u2019s ferry, CBP\u2019s acting commissioner emphasized that U.S. authorities would be expecting \u201cproper documentation\u201d from those fleeing the hurricane\u2019s destruction.\n\n\u201cThose evacuating from the Bahamas who are U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and those with proper documentation to enter the U.S. are being processed at U.S. Ports of Entry,\u201d CPB Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan wrote on Twitter. \u201cNo visa document requirements have changed.\u201d\n\nThousands have already fled the islands after Dorian tore away roofs, flooded entire neighborhoods and left tens of thousands of people homeless. Most have gone to Florida, which has close historical ties to the Bahamas.\n\nBut many survivors seeking respite in Freeport on Sunday did not find it. Hundreds struggled to buy tickets on outgoing ferries and flights. Eventually, workers at the Freeport Harbour locked the terminal doors after all of the seats on the Sunday evening ferry had been sold. Many people continued to wait outside.\n\nPeople waited in line for hours to buy tickets and board the evening Balearia Caribbean ferry. Their homes had been flooded, power cut off, water contaminated. The boat to Fort Lauderdale promised to carry them to family and friends waiting to provide support.\n\nBut after the announcement demanding visas, a long line of refugees slowly filed off the boat.\n\n\u201cThis is terrible,\u201d one woman who stayed on the ferry told WSVN as the ferry left the harbor.\n\nUnder existing U.S. policy, Bahamians can bypass the visa process by providing a passport, proof of a clean criminal record and going through a pre-screening conducted by CBP in Freeport and Nassau. On Saturday, a cruise ship called the Grand Celebration boarded nearly 1,500 refugees and brought them to Palm Beach, Fla., without requiring passengers to show U.S. visas, according to media reports.\n\nAs anger and confusion mounted on Sunday, CPB cited the Grand Celebration\u2019s successful arrival as proof that the U.S. isn\u2019t blocking refugees from the island.\n\n\u201cCBP continues to process the arrivals of passengers evacuating from the Bahamas according to established policy and procedures \u2014 as demonstrated by the nearly 1,500 Hurricane Dorian survivors who arrived at the Port of Palm Beach, Fla., aboard a cruise ship on Saturday and were processed without incident,\u201d a CBP spokesman said in a statement.\n\nIn that statement, CBP emphasized that Grand Celebration worked with officials in both nations before the voyage.\n\n\u201cThe Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line coordinated their evacuation mission with U.S. and Bahamian government officials before departing The Bahamas, and coordinated with CBP prior to the arrival of the C/S Grand Celebration,\u201d the federal agency said. \u201cAll of the evacuees possessed valid travel documents.\u201d\n\nCBP said on Sunday that the U.S. Embassy in Nassau is open for emergency visa appointments. The agency also requested all refugees present themselves at a U.S. port of entry so that their admission can be reported to Bahamian authorities searching for missing residents in Abaco and Grand Bahama.\n\nIn the Bahamas, tens of thousands are still without homes, electricity or clean water. Mark Green, the administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, told The Post it looked like the islands had been \u201chit by a nuclear bomb.\u201d Bahamian officials warned that the death toll on the islands is likely to rise significantly as authorities continue to survey the destruction.", "description": "Crew members turned away Hurricane Dorian refugees who had boarded a boat bound for Florida, amid confusion around visa requirements for evacuees trying to leave the Bahamas.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "September At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
