For this fiscal year ending in September, they met a more-modest goal of 68,000.\n\nExperts say the military\u2019s appeal has been waning among young people, and a tight labor market is typically the toughest time to recruit.\n\nIn a pilot program in Chicago, the Army is tailoring its message by neighborhood, adjusting advertising and staffing to match an area\u2019s demographics. The program here is part of a push into nearly two dozen cities where the Army has missed targets in the past. Across the country, the service is tapping into market data the way corporations or political campaigns might, and it is making sure recruiters are the first ones who get issued new eye-catching uniforms.\n\nJROTC Students at a Chicago school saluted during a meeting where Sgt.

Join the conversation below.\n\nSwelling Ranks The Army launched targeted, data-driven recruiting campaigns after falling short of its goal last year.

One Chicago recruiting station will soon have a full complement of recruiters, including a woman, African-Americans, a Spanish speaker and a Polish-American.\n\n\u201cWe can say to the recruiters that here\u2019s the predominant buy-in factor,\u201d said Tim Turpin, spokesman for the Chicago recruiting battalion. \u201cWhen you head over here to this school, here\u2019s what you should be focusing on.\u201d\n\nRecruiting for the all-volunteer corps is a challenge, especially when the economy is strong. Recruits need to have a high-school diploma and the base salary for an enlistee is just over $20,000 per year, plus benefits including room, board and health care. It can take a few months to ship to boot camp after signing a contract and then months more of basic and specialty training before finally being assigned to a unit.\n\nThe military\u2019s appeal has been waning among young people amid a tight labor market, making recruiter Sgt. Tejada\u2019s job more difficult. Photo: Joshua Lott for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cThe propensity for young people to enlist is going down, and the Army\u2019s also fighting a red hot economy, which always makes it difficult,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \u201cThey need to do something.\u201d\n\nArmy officials said that the lower recruiting numbers don\u2019t give the whole picture and that new advertising techniques help lead the Army to make thousands more contacts with potential recruits and sign up higher-quality troops. Officials have also focused on how to better retain troops once in uniform. The service issued fewer waivers this year, trying to shake the Army\u2019s reputation of lowering quality in order to put people in uniform.\n\nRecruiters like Sgt. 1st Class Jose Tejada, a 37-year-old combat veteran of the infantry, say the change isn\u2019t always apparent on the ground where every day can be a challenge. In his two years in Chicago, he has signed up an average of just more than one person per month, a respectable performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to sit down and break down the data,\u201d said Sgt. Tejada. \u201cIt\u2019s like being on deployment, it\u2019s go, go, go.\u201d\n\nOn a recent morning, Sgt. Tejada was in his crisp uniform giving a presentation to a classroom of high-schoolers where one of his primary goals is simply to debunk myths about serving.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that you join the Army and they give you a weapon and ship you off to war,\u201d he told the students. \u201cThat is not the case.\u201d\n\nA senior Army instructor, Harry Mercado, speaks with Sgt. Tejada ahead of a visit to the Prosser Career Academy in Chicago earlier this month.

Tejada\u2019s efforts at this high school were aided because the few dozen students were enrolled in Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, or JROTC, a program found in many public schools that helps introduce students to military life.\n\nThe predominantly Hispanic students listened politely, and at one point Sgt. Tejada told them a brief version of his life story. He said he knows how tough it is to grow up in an immigrant community and invited the kids to reach out to him, even volunteering to go to their homes and speak with their parents about the military.\n\nAt another visit to a Chicago high school, Sgt. Tejada prepared for his presentation as some potential recruits sat impassively or looked at their phones. He got their attention when a fellow recruiter walked in wearing the new olive-green uniform\u2014a throwback to World War II and punctuated with colorful patches, ribbons and badges.\n\n\u201cWhoa! Those are the new uniforms?\u201d one of the kids asked as they gathered around the recruiter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be wearing that one tomorrow,\u201d Sgt. Tejada said.\n\nWrite to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. Army is experimenting with new recruiting tactics as it struggles to connect with young people who have other job options in a strong economy with low unemployment.", "authors": ["Ben Kesling", "Ben.Kesling Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107497/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
