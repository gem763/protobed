Why not?\n\nIt was the kind of attitude you needed if you wanted to take part in a house swap in 1985.\n\nThirty-four years ago, Midday introduced its viewers to the intriguing style of vacation that was then more familiar to Europeans than Canadians.\n\nOn Midday, viewers met the Hyslops, a couple from Ontario, as well as the Sharkeys, a visiting couple from Scotland.\n\nA European tradition?\n\nSome house swaps included the use of a vehicle. That was the case for the Sharkeys, who, as seen above, drove their hosts' car to their home in Southampton, Ont., in 1985. (Midday/CBC Archives)\n\nThe two couples had gotten in contact with one another through a house swap exchange organization, which listed their respective homes in a printed book of listings.\n\n\"People around the world have the same book and they arrange swaps by writing letters,\" the CBC's Rae Hull explained to viewers back in September of 1985.\n\n\"The Europeans have been doing house swaps for the last 35 years.\"\n\nFrom Scotland to Southampton, Ont.\n\nThe Sharkeys spoke to Midday about their Scotland-to-Ontario house swap. As of 1985, it was their fourth such trip. (Midday/CBC Archives)\n\nAs Hull explained, the Sharkeys' Canadian adventure was their fourth such exchange.\n\nHull said previous trips had taken the Scottish couple to both a Manhattan apartment and a Massachusetts beach house while their owners occupied the Sharkeys' Scotland residence.\n\nTheir destination in Canada was Southampton, Ont., a small beach town on the shores of Lake Huron.\n\nThey met the Hyslops at Toronto's Pearson airport to exchange house keys and pick up their car.\n\nThat unexpected landing place for a vacation was part of the charm of the house swap.\n\n\"The people who take these exchanges can end up in literally any corner of another country,\" said Hull.", "description": "If you weren't willing to hand over the keys to your home to a near-stranger, it would be hard to take part in a house swap.", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5252508.1566247571!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/john-and-linda-sharkey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
