There was also an explanatory letter from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU.\n\nThe Court of Session in Edinburgh will resume its hearing about the Benn Act, and examine whether the missives \u2013 one signed, one unsigned, one signed by someone else \u2013 constitute contempt of court.\n\nThe SNP MP and campaigner Joanna Cherry said it was \u201carguable\u201d that the PM\u2019s letters \u201cseeks to frustrate what the Benn Act sets out to do.\u201d She accused Johnson of playing a \u201cchildish trick\u201d with the different letters.\n\nBut Lord Pannick \u2013 he of the Supreme Court case against the government\u2019s unlawful prorogation \u2013 writes in The Times today that Johnson is \u201cjust about\u201d on \u201cthe right side of the law\u201d.\n\nPannick QC repeated the view on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. \u201cI think the Prime Minister is on the right side of the law on this occasion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Benn Act required him to send a letter to the president of the European Council seeking an extension and that's what he\u2019s done. The Act doesn\u2019t require that he\u2019s signed the letter. My view is that he\u2019s on the right side of the law \u2013 just about \u2013 on this occasion.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson is set for a showdown with Speaker John Bercow as the government pushes for a knife-edge Commons vote on the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal. Mr Bercow will rule on whether the government can bring a so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on its plans. If the Speaker blocks the move, focus will switch to the government bringing its Withdrawal Agreement Bill before MPs on", "authors": ["Adam Forrest"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/07/boris-johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
