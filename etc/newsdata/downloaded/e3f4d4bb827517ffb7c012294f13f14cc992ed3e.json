Gangat, a businessman of high stature in Adelaide, is the area representive for the organisation in the regions of Adelaide and Bedford. According to Gangat, four boreholes were originally drilled in Adelaide, from which the water was being pumped to the local municipality. In many instances holes were sunk to a depth of more than 120m. The four boreholes were subsequently sold to the municipality.\n\nIn addition, boreholes were also sunk at Gymnasium High School, Adelaide Primary School in Bezuidenhoutville, as well as one on the premises of Lingelethu school to serve both the school and community.\n\nWater was also supplied regularly to communities by means of water supply trucks.\n\nThe water was being transported from Makhanda where the organisation has its head office. The transport of water by road costs thousands of rands per truckload.\n\nGift of the Givers also came to the aid of farmers last week, when they delivered 175 bales of fodder as well as 32 pallets of five litre bottles of water. Since last week, the organisation has been delivering 27 500 litres of water to Adelaide and Bedford daily.\n\n\u201cIt is heartbreaking to see cows grazing on cardboard from municipal refuse bins in our towns,\u201d Gangat said.\n\nAdelaide resident and retired principal, Gerald Bailey said that the entire community was extremely appreciative of what the organisation has done for them.\n\nAlthough scattered showers fell over a vast area over the past weekend, much more rain was still needed to remedy the situation.", "description": "IMTIAZ Sooliman and the humanitarian organisation, Gift of the Givers, have become real beacons of light for residents and farmers in the drought\u2013stricken Eastern Cape.", "authors": ["Nolan Venter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9433/a1a670ed371640b281a5ee8545f36df9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
