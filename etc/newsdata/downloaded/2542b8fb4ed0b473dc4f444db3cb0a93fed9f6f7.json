From \u00a39,000 Valentino dresses to her own charitable fashion line, she\u2019s proved to be quite the fashion force.\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to style, poor Harry hasn\u2019t had a look in. But that looks to be changing.\n\nOver the last few years, the Duke of Sussex\u2019s sense of fashion has steadily improved, transforming him into a well-groomed prince clad in slick J. Crew suits, desert boots and crew neck jumpers.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry walks through Angola minefield 22 years after Princess Diana\n\nPrince Harry opted for a white linen shirt, grey chinos and grey trainers to visit the township of Nyanga in Cape Town [Photo: Getty Images] More\n\nAnd his style transformation is more clear than ever during the 10-day tour of South Africa and Africa.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen him opt for lighter, more understated shades - pale blues, greige and khaki - this past week, quite possibly a nod to his safari surrounding and a clever way to keep cool in the heat.\n\nDay one of the tour saw Prince Harry looking fresh and ready as he stepped foot on South African soil wearing a white linen button-down with a pair of \u2018greige\u2019 chinos and grey trainers. It was quite the casual look for the new dad, but a look he pulled off well.\n\nREAD MORE: Baby Archie makes royal tour debut - and fans think he looks just like Prince Harry\n\nLike his wife Meghan, the Duke doesn\u2019t shy away from affordable high-street labels either.

Crew.\n\nThe Duke visited District 6 in Cape Town wearing a grey two-piece suit from J.Crew, a white button-down shirt and chocolate brown shoes.
