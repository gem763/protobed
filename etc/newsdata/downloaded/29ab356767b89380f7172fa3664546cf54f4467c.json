Miller\u2019s nonfiction book \u201cMasters of the Air: America\u2019s Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany.\u201d The show will be executive produced by Tom Hanks, Gary Goetzman and Steven Spielberg.\n\nThe distinction between TV+ shows that are and aren\u2019t produced by Apple\u2019s studio will probably be lost on most viewers. That\u2019s fair enough \u2014 especially because in the streaming world, the \u201coriginal\u201d label encompasses a number of different types of content.\n\nFor example, Netflix Originals include shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d which are produced by other studios, with Netflix paying for the exclusive rights (in some cases, those rights are limited to certain geographies).\n\nAnd then there are shows like \u201cStranger Things,\u201d which Netflix produces and owns itself. Those self-produced shows will probably be a growing part of Netflix\u2019s original content mix moving forward.\n\nSimilarly, by creating its own studio, Apple can own some of its TV+ content outright, lessening the need to negotiate licensing fees with other studios, and also giving it the rights for things like merchandise.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the studio doesn\u2019t have a name yet, but it will be led by Apple\u2019s Worldwide Video heads Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, who previously led Sony Pictures TV.", "description": "While Apple has a long list of new programming lined up for its TV+ subscription streaming service, the company won\u2019t actually own any of the announced shows \u2014 until now.
