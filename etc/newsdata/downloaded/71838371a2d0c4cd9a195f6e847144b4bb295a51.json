Her first book, How to Lose the Information War, is scheduled to be published by Bloomsbury\u2019s IBTauris in 2020.\n\nWhile I was in Ukraine this spring covering the country\u2019s presidential election, I initially doubted that Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian with no formal political experience, could become the next president of Ukraine. The moment I realized he was likely not only to win, but to win big wasn\u2019t after a speech outlining his policies. He never gave one. Nor was it when he debated incumbent Petro Poroshenko in Kiev\u2019s Olympic Stadium, a spectacle in which both candidates behaved more like showmen than statesmen. Rather, it was in a concert hall in March outside of the capital, where he and his comedy troupe performed a variety show before a national campaign-free \u201cquiet period\u201d prior to the first round of voting.\n\nMy Ukrainian friends told me they found Zelensky\u2019s brand of humor crude and embarrassing\u2014in one of his skits, he \u201cplays piano\u201d with his penis\u2014but in that final performance he displayed a more refined sensibility. He and his troupe still made sex jokes and told one-liners about his height (he\u2019s quite short), but they also served up quick-witted riffs on the nature of the modern news cycle, the quagmires of Ukrainian politics, and a pun-filled song about patriotism in a country that never quite seemed to fulfill its promises.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThough many commentators label Zelensky a Ukrainian Donald Trump because of his lack of political experience and background in entertainment, Zelensky is in fact an adept political actor\u2014including during high-stakes phone calls with the leader of the free world.\n\nZelensky is a performer at heart, and he isn\u2019t ashamed to put those skills to use as a politician. They were on display in his July 25 phone call with President Trump, the summary of which was released Wednesday. \u201cWe wanted to drain the swamp here in our country,\u201d Zelensky says, using one of Trump\u2019s catchphrases. Then he joins the U.S. president in lambasting foreign partners and a former U.S. diplomat, and he makes sure to squeeze in a mention of a trip to New York, where he stayed at Trump Tower, of course. At times the flattery is cringe-inducing, but Zelensky is hardly a clueless, boot-licking stooge. He surely knew he had to play the role of flatterer in chief to have any chance at obtaining what his country needs: continued aid and a powerful friend.\n\nPresident Zelensky has made ending the war in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region\u2014which was instigated and is sustained by Russia and has claimed 13,000 lives and counting\u2014his administration\u2019s top priority. He has made some progress toward that goal, overseeing a historic prisoner swap with Russia that saw one of Ukraine\u2019s most respected filmmakers as well as 24 sailors captured last November returned home. According to information from the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, fewer civilians have been killed in the conflict this year than any year previously. A July cease-fire at the contact line seems to be holding firmer than its previous incarnations.\n\nFor Zelensky, Trump could be the key to ending the war in the Donbas. The American president has made his admiration for and cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin no secret. Likewise, Trump\u2019s views about Ukraine\u2014ambivalence about the status of Crimea, which Russia illegally seized in 2014, and support for ending the sanctions placed on Russia in response to its activities in Ukraine\u2014make Ukrainians nervous. A cordial relationship between Trump and Zelensky could give Trump insight into Ukraine\u2019s perspective and give Ukraine leverage it did not enjoy under former President Petro Poroshenko, who struggled to connect with the U.S. leader.\n\nUkraine does not have the luxury to pick and choose its international partners, something I learned when I served as an adviser to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry in 2016 and 2017 under the auspices of a Fulbright Public Policy Fellowship. Ukraine relies on its larger, richer allies as it attempts to shed its post-Soviet legacy. The United States\u2014its largest and richest ally\u2014provides not only for the now-famous military aid package, but hundreds of millions of dollars in civilian aid, supporting projects in just about every sector. The containment of the Chernobyl nuclear site, fighting HIV/AIDS, building cybersecurity capabilities, and creating government bodies that are more responsive to citizens are just a few of the projects that U.S assistance makes possible. Continued reform, including the pursuit of energy independence from Russia and the cleanup of the court system, the biggest obstacle to Ukrainian anti-corruption efforts, would be imperiled without this assistance. The United States also plays a key role in corralling European partners to uphold their own sanctions on Russia and to continue to support Ukraine as it walks the long and often bumpy road of democratic reform.\n\nThere are reasons to believe Zelensky\u2019s slippery answers to President Trump\u2019s repeated requests that he investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter were deliberate. According to congressional staff who recently visited Ukraine and spoke with senior Ukrainian officials, the Zelensky administration was upset at feeling that it was being used and didn\u2019t want to be a pawn in America\u2019s domestic political machinations. In the phone call and at the meeting of the two presidents Wednesday at the U.N. General Assembly, Zelensky was careful not to let the name Biden cross his lips. Instead, Zelensky says he will \u201clook into the situation\u201d related to Burisma, the company on whose board Hunter Biden sat, more generally. At the U.N., Zelensky also mentioned a few of the other important cases he hoped his new prosecutor would investigate in addition to Burisma, and maintained that he didn\u2019t want to be dragged into American politics.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate for Zelensky and Ukraine that his telephone conversation with Trump has become the linchpin of an impeachment investigation. The circumstances now dictate that the two leaders are unlikely to \u201ctalk on the phone more often,\u201d a dream that Zelensky pined for at the beginning of the call. Knowing the discussion would be made public, perhaps he would have played a less contrite, stronger character. Maybe he would have eased up on the Trump catchphrases. But he had to play this role to play Trump, and it\u2019s one he probably plays better than many other leaders who are forced to do the same.", "description": "In that July 25 phone call between the two presidents, who was manipulating whom?", "authors": ["Nina Jankowicz"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d1/e5/d81d8e744edc86b07ee5106ed976/mag-zelensky-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
