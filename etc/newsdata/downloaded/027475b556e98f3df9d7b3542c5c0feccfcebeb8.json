In 2014, two weeks after a New York grand jury\u2019s failure to indict Pantaleo inspired large protests, two NYPD officers were shot in their patrol car. The seven-week slowdown that followed, according to a later data analysis, also showed a drop in reported major crimes along with a drop in arrests for minor offenses\u2014those defined as \u201cquality of life\u201d issues that police have been told to target lest disorder reign. That was the idea behind the largely discredited \u201cbroken windows theory\u201d of policing, like arresting Eric Garner for selling untaxed cigarettes on the street. The slowdowns that followed his death show what a city without broken windows policing can look like.\n\nA week before this summer\u2019s slowdown, as O\u2019Neill was still weighing the recommendation to dismiss Pantaleo, Attorney General William Barr offered some Trump-inspired federal backup. The problem, according to Barr, in a speech before the Fraternal Order of Police, isn\u2019t police violence but \u201canti-police\u201d sentiment. \u201cWhenever there is a confrontation involving the use of force by police, they automatically start screaming for the officers\u2019 scalps, regardless of the facts,\u201d Barr said.\n\nYes, abuse could happen, said Barr, but he sandwiched this acknowledgement in a call for total obedience to law enforcement. \u201c[W]hat stands between chaos and carnage on the one hand, and the civilized and tranquil society we all yearn for, is the thin blue line of law enforcement. You are the ones manning the ramparts\u2014day in, and day out.\u201d The current leader of the Justice Department blamed that \u201cchaos and carnage\u201d on elected officials who don\u2019t forcefully tell the people they represent to always obey the police.\n\nFor Police Union President Lynch, that elected foe is New York\u2019s mayor. Bill de Blasio was all but absent from the city this summer, off on the presidential campaign trail, pleasing no one with his claims that he had reformed the NYPD. Anti-police violence activists, too, saw de Blasio as an obstacle, and in July some interrupted his last turn on the debate stage with demands to \u201cFire Pantaleo.\u201d The mayor\u2019s campaign trail promises of a chastened, reformed police force\u2014after de-escalation and implicit bias training, and donning bodycams\u2014were as convincing as his primary bid.\n\nThe police unions have now fully focused their ire on both de Blasio and O\u2019Neill. Wednesday, the PBA passed a vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d on both, demanding the commissioner resign and asking New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to give the boot to de Blasio. The Sergeants Benevolent Association (as distinct from the Police Benevolent Association, representing 7,000 NYPD sergeants) official Twitter account has been roasting the mayor in all-caps fashion. \u201cYOU PHONY BASTARD. What happen [sic] to Eric Garner is on YOU & BRATTON\u201d it blared after de Blasio did a CNN town hall this week. When the mayor tweeted out a pledge to bring the perpetrator of an alleged anti-Semitic hate crime to justice, SBA hit \u201csend\u201d on a tweet that read, in part, \u201cWE will find his attacker? Mayor DeBlasio YOU are not part of the WE. YOU are NOT NYPD NEVER were, NEVER will be.\u201d\n\nAll this makes it even more bizarre that the NYPD have realized de Blasio\u2019s fantasy of a reformed NYPD by giving New York the gift of this slowdown summer.\n\nShould this protest become permanent, and New York\u2019s finest abandon the kind of policing that took Eric Garner\u2019s life, they will help make the case that law enforcement officers are not what makes a city safe. To pretend such police work is necessary empowers those who wish to protect police who cause the harm.", "description": "Arrests and crime are down amid cops\u2019 protest of the firing of officer Daniel Pantaleo, who killed Eric Garner.", "authors": ["Melissa Gira Grant"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d3be350a459a12e5f42c493bce9eac1708c56273.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
