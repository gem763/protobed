It features the actors singing up-close against a black background, mimicking the style of the original music video Morissette put out in the '90s. But instead of this being a solo showcase, Jagged Little Pill's version transforms the hit into a back-and-forth dialogue between two characters resisting the act of falling in love.\n\n\"Some people enter relationships a little more apprehensive than others,\" Morissette told Rolling Stone. \"Watching them both interact like, 'I really want this but I'm terrified!' That's what the song's about.\"\n\nFor Jagged Little Pill, Morissette enlisted screenwriter Diablo Cody (Juno, Tully) to write a book based on the album; she also brought on composer Tom Kitt (American Idiot, Next to Normal), director Diane Paulus (Waitress, Pippin) and choreographer and Beyonc\u00e9 collaborator, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui.\n\nThe musical made its premiere at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass., in 2018 and received rave reviews from The New York Times, Variety and more.", "description": "Jagged Little Pill will make its Broadway debut next month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5321744.1571169984!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jagged-little-pill-musical.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
