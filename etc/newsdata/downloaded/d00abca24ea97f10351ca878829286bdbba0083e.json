That day France led by 16 points after 31 minutes and England were unable to recover.\n\nUnder Eddie Jones, England have developed a habit of scoring early tries \u2013 in their last 19 matches they have scored one inside 10 minutes on 12 occasions \u2013 but it was also a sluggish start that proved their undoing in the 2015 defeat by Australia that eliminated them from their own World Cup. The Wallabies led 17-3 at half-time and England could not claw back the deficit.\n\nEngland\u2019s Curry and Underhill aim for early hit against Australian idols | Gerard Meagher Read more\n\nAs a result, Youngs urged England to begin on the front foot on Saturday, revealing that Jones and the captain, Owen Farrell, had hammered home the message during their final training session on Friday. \u201cMy experience [of 2011] is just about making sure the intensity of the game doesn\u2019t shock you in the beginning,\u201d said Youngs.\n\n\u201cFrance raced that day into a lead and we couldn\u2019t pull ourselves back. So it comes down to making sure we come out of the blocks, bring that intensity from the start and I\u2019m sure they will be saying the same thing so I imagine the first 20 minutes will be pretty full-on. We need to make sure we get the start we want.\n\n\u201cWe just spoke about how good our prep has been, and making sure we go out there and take the game to them, get ourselves on the front foot and come out with an intensity that marries up with our preparation so that\u2019s been the message and it certainly feels like we\u2019ve built towards the game.\u201d\n\nYoungs and Tuilagi are two of four players \u2013 Dan Cole and Courtney Lawes are the others \u2013 who are taking part in their third World Cup campaigns for England, having reached the last eight in 2011 and gone out in the pool stages four years later.\n\nYoungs admitted that neither of those campaigns were acceptable but believes England are in a far better place as they seek a first World Cup semi-final since 2007. Warming to the theme after Jones urged England to channel the \u2018samurai spirit\u2019 in Saturday\u2019s do-or-die clash, Youngs added: \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to go out there and accept things not going your way. You are going to fight right until the end. We have some boys in this team who don\u2019t know when they are beaten and I\u2019m sure, it goes without saying for any team participating this weekend, that they will fight until the very end. Back home the expectation is the same as always \u2013 to win and put it all out on the pitch. This will be no different. It\u2019s no different to any time we step on to the pitch as an England player \u2013 we go out there to win and to perform and put it all out there.\n\n\u201cWe clearly weren\u2019t good enough in 2011 or 2015. But certainly in 2019, I feel we are more capable, I feel like the squad is more capable of achieving something. So from that point of view, as I said before, we\u2019ve just got to make sure when we take the field, we relax, we have clear thinking, and we go out there and put our best put forward.\u201d", "description": "Ben Youngs has called on England to fly out of the blocks against Australia after pinpointing a slow start as the reason they lost their last World Cup quarter-final eight years ago", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668c98a3410d736a0348ea2ff312ca3c20623225/112_189_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ac38421f0f983717abf14726cc96ba4", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
