How much more of this are we all going to put up with?\n\nHow many times does this need to happen before the people who run the game wake up to the fact that it is in crisis?\n\nAs punishments for what we saw in Sofia go, a two-game stadium ban - one of them suspended - is embarrassing. So too the insistence that the \u00a364,641 fine will hurt them.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut come on, you weren\u2019t surprised were you?\n\nUEFA have so much form for this it is ridiculous. We knew when it happened that they would live down to expectations. The only question was by how much.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nBulgaria should have been thrown out of Euro 2020 with a suspended ban from their next European competition. It really shouldn\u2019t have been that hard.\n\nSomeone, somewhere, needs to explain to the men at UEFA that the fine and the stadium ban will have zero impact on the fans who will probably watch their next game in the warmth of their homes or the pub.\n\nThen they\u2019ll be back. Primed and ready to aim their Nazi salutes and their racist invective at another country\u2019s black players. It isn\u2019t all about England.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAs for England, after passing up the chance to walk off in Sofia, this problem will be back for them too. The only thing that will change is the location.\n\nThe fact is, when you have 10 members of UEFA\u2019s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body that are all white you get the lack of empathy which leads them to believe they are actually making a difference when they are way off the mark.\n\nAnd what of the English FA? Where is their stick for European football\u2019s rulers after their call on the night of the Bulgaria game for the strongest possible action.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke went in back then, calling the experience: \u201cOne of the most appalling nights I\u2019ve seen in football.\"\n\nHe added: \u201dI think UEFA are going to need to think very carefully about the levels of abuse they can let players tolerate and they are going to have to decide who they are going to make an example of one day.\n\n\"I would like to see a very stringent review by UEFA because I know they take racism very seriously,\" he said.\n\n\"If they have zero tolerance to racism then one person making monkey chants is the same as 100 people making monkey chants.\u201d\n\n(Image: X03807)\n\nContrast all that with the whimper with which UEFA\u2019s announcement was greeted by the FA on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"While we acknowledge UEFA's ruling today, a huge challenge still exists around racism and discrimination in society,\u201d said a statement.\n\n\"Football has its part to play, and must do so, but it is for all to recognise the seriousness of the problem.\n\n\"While those responsible for such deplorable behaviour at home or abroad need to be held to account, we should not lose sight of the importance of education programmes in finding a long-term solution.\n\n\"That has to be the way forward to help address the root cause of such disgusting behaviour.\u201d\n\nExcuse me? For all their big talk suggesting they were putting the heat on UEFA, that was the best they could do?\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBulgaria should have gone.\n\nAnti-racism watchdogs Kick It Out believe that to be the case. European football watchdogs Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare) believe that to be the case - and they work closely with UEFA.\n\nAction is needed, not just expressions of disgust each time this happens.\n\nYet the FA have suddenly lost their collective voice. The recognition of the racism problem in this country works as a soundbite. But then you have to show leadership.\n\nMaybe they fear asking why Bulgaria haven\u2019t gone could lead to questions as to why Yeovil were not expelled from the FA Cup following their fans\u2019 racist abuse instead of being rewarded with a replay.\n\nEither way, it has left footballers - black and white - with a decision to make.\n\nDo they want to keep being let down by the authorities or are they willing, finally, to recognise their power as Haringey Borough did two weeks ago and make a stand?", "description": "UEFA have handed down a two-game stadium ban - one match suspended - and \u00a364k fine for the latest racist act from Bulgaria fans", "authors": ["Darren Lewis", "Image", "Getty Images", "Internet Unknown", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752716.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UEFA-president-Aleksander-Ceferin-arrives-at-a-news-conference-in-Stara-Pazova-Serbia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
