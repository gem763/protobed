In March 1997, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, the nonprofit organization that oversees the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, sent a letter to each of its 10,883 U.S. congregations, and to many more congregations worldwide. The organization was concerned about the legal risk posed by possible child molesters within its ranks. The letter laid out instructions on how to deal with a known predator: Write a detailed report answering 12 questions\u2014Was this a onetime occurrence, or did the accused have a history of child molestation? How is the accused viewed within the community? Does anyone else know about the abuse?\u2014and mail it to Watchtower\u2019s headquarters in a special blue envelope. Keep a copy of the report in your congregation\u2019s confidential file, the instructions continued, and do not share it with anyone. Thus did the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses build what might be the world\u2019s largest database of undocumented child molesters: at least two decades\u2019 worth of names and addresses\u2014likely numbering in the tens of thousands\u2014and detailed acts of alleged abuse, most of which have never been shared with law enforcement, all scanned and searchable in a Microsoft SharePoint file. In recent decades, much of the world\u2019s attention to allegations of abuse has focused on the Catholic Church and other religious groups. Less notice has been paid to the abuse among the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, a Christian sect with more than 8.5 million members. Yet all this time, Watchtower has refused to comply with multiple court orders to release the information contained in its database and has paid millions of dollars over the years to keep it secret, even from the survivors whose stories are contained within.\n\nThat effort has been remarkably successful\u2014until recently. A white Priority Mail box filled with manila envelopes sits on the floor of Mark O\u2019Donnell\u2019s wood-paneled home office, on the outskirts of Baltimore, Maryland. Mark, 51, is the owner of an exercise-equipment repair business and a longtime Jehovah\u2019s Witness who quietly left the religion in late 2013. Soon after, he became known to ex\u2013Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as John Redwood, an activist and a blogger who reports on the various controversies, including cases of child abuse, surrounding Watchtower. (Recently, he has begun using his own name.) When I first met Mark, in May of last year, he appeared at the front door of his modest home in the same outfit he nearly always wears: khaki cargo shorts, a short-sleeved shirt, white sneakers, and sweat socks pulled up over his calves. He invited me into his densely furnished office, where a fan barely dispelled the wafting smell of cat food. He pulled an envelope from the Priority Mail box and passed me its contents, a mixture of typed and handwritten letters discussing various sins allegedly committed by members of a Jehovah\u2019s Witness congregation in Massachusetts. All the letters in the box had been stolen by an anonymous source inside the religion and shared with Mark. The sins described in the letters ranged from the mundane\u2014smoking pot, marital infidelity, drunkenness\u2014to the horrifying. Slowly, over the past couple of years, Mark has been leaking the most damning contents of the box, much of which is still secret.\n\nMark\u2019s eyebrows are permanently arched, and when he makes an important point, he peers out above his rimless glasses, eyes widened, which lends him a conspiratorial air. \u201cStart with these,\u201d he said. Among the papers Mark showed me that day was a series of letters about a man from Springfield, Massachusetts, who had been disfellowshipped\u2014a form of excommunication\u2014three times. When the man was once again reinstated, in 2008, someone working in a division of Watchtower wrote to his congregation, noting that in 1989 he was said to have \u201callowed his 11-year-old stepdaughter to touch his penis \u2026 on at least two occasions.\u201d I was struck by the oddness of the language. It insinuated that the man had agreed to, rather than initiated, the sexual contact with his stepdaughter. After I left Mark\u2019s house, I tracked down the stepdaughter, now 40. In fact, she told me, she had been only 8 when her stepfather had molested her. \u201cHe was the adult and I was the kid, so I thought I didn\u2019t have any choice,\u201d she said. She was terrified, she told me. \u201cIt took me two years to go to my mom about it.\u201d Her mother immediately went to the congregation\u2019s elders, who later called the girl and her stepfather in to pray with them. She remembers it as a humiliating experience.\n\nHer stepfather was eventually disfellowshipped for instances that involved \u201cfornication,\u201d \u201cdrunkenness,\u201d and \u201clying,\u201d according to the letters. But according to the stepdaughter, his alleged molestation of her resulted only in his being \u201cprivately reproved,\u201d a closed-door reprimand that is usually accompanied by a temporary loss of privileges, such as not being allowed to offer comments during Bible study or lead a prayer. The letters make no reference to police being notified; the stepdaughter said her mother was encouraged to keep the matter private, and no attempt was made to keep the stepfather away from other children. (Calls to the congregation\u2019s Kingdom Hall\u2014the Witness version of a church\u2014for comment went unanswered.) By the time the letters were written, the man was attending a different congregation and had married another woman with children; he is still part of that family today. Near the end of the final letter in Mark\u2019s possession is a question: \u201cIs there any responsibility on the part of either body of elders \u2026 to inform his current wife of his past history of child molestation?\u201d Mark O\u2019Donnell\u2019s childhood was an isolated one. His parents, Jerry and Susan, had started attending Jehovah\u2019s Witness meetings in the mid-1960s. Another couple from Baltimore had told them of Watchtower\u2019s prediction that the world would end in 1975, bringing death to all non-Witnesses and transforming Earth into a paradise for the faithful. In 1968, just after Mark was born, Jerry and Susan were group-baptized in a swimming pool in Washington, D.C. Mark was an only child, and he inherited his father\u2019s peculiar love of record-keeping. Mark would show up to meetings at the Kingdom Hall with a briefcase full of religious texts.\n\nAs in any religion, there\u2019s some variation among Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in how strictly they interpret the teachings that govern their faith; Mark\u2019s upbringing seems to have been especially stringent. As a child, he attended at least five meetings a week, plus several hours of private Bible study. On Saturday mornings, he joined his parents in \u201cfield service,\u201d knocking on doors in search of converts. He was taught that most people outside the organization were corrupted by Satan and, given the chance, would try to steal from him, drug him, or rape him. Mainstream books and magazines were considered the work of Satan. If he broke any of the religion\u2019s main rules, he could be disfellowshipped, meaning even his own family would have to shun him. Throughout Mark\u2019s childhood, he heard elders cite Proverbs 13:24: \u201cWhoever holds back his rod hates his son.\u201d Mark\u2019s parents took the lesson to heart and beat him frequently. The religion forbids celebrating birthdays, voting, serving in the military, and accepting blood transfusions, even in life-and-death situations. Witnesses were encouraged to devote themselves to bringing more converts into the religion before the end of the world arrived. \u201cReports are heard of brothers selling their homes and property\u201d to spend their last days proselytizing, said a Watchtower publication in 1974. \u201cCertainly this is a fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked world\u2019s end.\u201d Some Witnesses stopped going to the doctor, quit their jobs, or ran up debt.\n\nBut piety, Mark noticed, did not always translate to morality. When he was 12, Mark became suspicious of a local Witness named Louis Ongsingco, a flight attendant who would bring home Toblerone bars for the local Witness kids and invite them to his apartment to act out religious plays. Mark noticed Ongsingco touching young girls in a way that made him uncomfortable. He told an elder about his concerns. But rather than take action against Ongsingco, the elder told him what Mark had said. Days later, Ongsingco pulled Mark aside and scolded him. Mark\u2019s instincts seem to have been right. In 2001, one of Mark\u2019s childhood friends, Erin Michelle Shifflett, along with four other women, sued Ongsingco for sexual assault. The cases were settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Ongsingco died in 2016. To Mark, the lesson was that for all the emphasis the elders placed on moral purity, there was no greater sin than speaking out against other Witnesses. By the time Mark was in high school, in the early 1980s, 1975 had come and gone, but Watchtower had a new prediction for the apocalypse. It said that the world would end before the passing of the generation that was alive in 1914. At the time, the youngest members of that generation were 70, so the new prediction created a sense of urgency. \u201cMy parents basically told me, \u2018You\u2019re not even going to live to graduate from college,\u2019\u201d Mark said. At 17, despite having a year of college credit and a guidance counselor imploring him to apply, he decided to settle for a high-school diploma. He was baptized and later started his exercise-equipment repair company. The business provided enough flexibility for him to perform 50 hours of field service for the Witnesses a month, which qualified him for the rank of auxiliary pioneer.\n\nThough many Witnesses left the religion after 1975, membership was on the upswing by the 1990s, and the organization was building new Kingdom Halls. Mark was installing a sound system in a new hall in Baltimore in the fall of 1997 when a young woman named Kimmy Weber asked to borrow his ladder. At 20, Kimmy was putting in more than 90 hours of field service a month, making her a full-fledged pioneer. She had completed a two-year program at a community college on a scholarship, and would later get permission from the local elders to get her bachelor\u2019s degree. Mark was drawn to her drive and intensity. He tracked down her email address; they flirted over AOL Instant Messenger and were married within eight months. They wanted to start a family, but decided to wait until after the arrival of paradise on Earth, when they, and their children, would be perfect. In the meantime, Kimmy began opening their home to abused and abandoned cats. As Mark\u2019s business grew, he brought on employees, mostly other Witnesses. When he and Kimmy had saved enough money to buy the house across the street as a rental property, they filled its three units with other Witnesses. There were ski vacations, softball games, dinner parties, and game nights\u2014always with friends who shared their faith. But as much as Mark enjoyed his friends\u2019 company, he started to chafe at the insularity of their social life. It felt less like intimacy and more like a self-imposed bubble. These frustrations eventually grew into suspicions about Watchtower itself. He\u2019d heard rumors that the organization was covering up cases of pedophilia and child abuse. But Watchtower always dismissed such criticism as \u201capostate-driven lies.\u201d\n\nA few years after he and Kimmy married, he saw a protester outside a Witness convention holding a sign that read A JW Elder Molested Me. \u201cI looked at that sign,\u201d Mark told me, \u201cand I locked it in my brain. I\u2019ll never forget it. I said to myself, There\u2019s no way he\u2019s lying. Nobody would stand out there and hold a sign that says An Elder Molested Me unless it really happened. No way. He\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d\n\nWatchtower adjusted its estimates for the apocalypse several more times. In 2010, it introduced the Overlapping Generations theory, which claims that the end will come before the death of everyone who was alive at the same time as anyone who was alive in 1914. Mark found these revised predictions difficult to accept. In late 2013, Mark had an extreme reaction to an antibiotic and was confined to his couch for several weeks, away from the meetings and Bible studies. Left alone with his thoughts, he began to admit to himself that he no longer believed Armageddon was imminent. The Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses he knew were no more deserving of God\u2019s mercy than the nonbelievers he\u2019d met. And here he was, 45 years old and facing a health crisis. How much more of his life was he willing to waste inside the bubble? That November, as he and Kimmy were preparing to spend the weekend at a friend\u2019s house, Mark suddenly stopped packing and told Kimmy he couldn\u2019t maintain the facade anymore. He never attended another meeting.\n\nThough Kimmy kept going to meetings, her Witness friends pressured her to leave her marriage. \u201cThey would just come out of the blue with unsolicited advice,\u201d she told me. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t forget, Kimmy, Jehovah comes first!\u2019 \u2018At some point, you\u2019ll have to make your choice!\u2019\u201d But she didn\u2019t want to leave Mark. \u201cI just tried to figure out, how can I stay a Witness and him not?\u201d Mark\u2019s doctor had suggested that he take daily walks as part of his recovery. Kimmy already had a routine of evening strolls, and he began to join her. Mark told Kimmy that he\u2019d once planned to be an engineer, and that he felt he\u2019d been forced to choose between God and his ambition. Kimmy said she\u2019d once dreamed of becoming a doctor or a veterinarian. She revealed that she\u2019d always been terrified that having kissed Mark before they were married meant she might die at Armageddon. She told Mark she feared that, at 36, she\u2019d missed her chance to have children. Their walks got longer, eventually reaching eight or 10 miles a night. \u201cShe was trying to get into my head, to figure out what was going on,\u201d Mark told me. By this point, he\u2019d given himself permission to delve into so-called apostate material, books such as Crisis of Conscience, a 1983 expos\u00e9 written by a former member of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Governing Body. He also started watching YouTube videos by Lloyd Evans, a former British elder who has amassed a dedicated following with his anti-Watchtower arguments. A Witness can be disfellowshipped for sharing such material, so Mark didn\u2019t tell Kimmy.\n\nInstead, he shared small pieces of information to challenge what Kimmy had been taught, such as the truth about the 1975 doomsday prediction. Kimmy had grown up believing that overzealous Witnesses, not Watchtower, had chosen that date. But Mark, who rarely threw away anything, encouraged her to read the Watchtower articles exhorting members of the faith to sell their homes. Kimmy began to entertain the kind of doubts she\u2019d been trained to ignore. \u201cBut I think the big trigger for her,\u201d Mark said, \u201cwas when I mentioned Candace Conti.\u201d Candace Conti, now 33, was raised as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness in Fremont, California. When she was 9, the elders in her congregation paired her with a man named Jonathan Kendrick for Saturday-morning field service. Instead of going door-to-door to preach the word of God, Kendrick would take Conti to his house and molest her, she says. She estimates this went on for about two years. Years later, after Conti had left the Witnesses, she discovered Kendrick\u2019s name on the federal sex-offender registry. When she went back to the elders in her former congregation to tell them about the abuse, she was rebuffed by something called the two-witness rule. Rooted in Deuteronomy 19:15\u2014\u201cNo single witness may convict another for any error or any sin that he may commit\u201d\u2014the two-witness rule states that, barring a confession, no member of the organization can be officially accused of committing a sin without two credible eyewitnesses who are willing to corroborate the accusation. Critics say this rule has helped turn Witness communities into havens for child molesters, who rarely commit crimes in the presence of bystanders.\n\nThe elders told Conti that without a second witness to the molestation, there was nothing they could do. (When reached for comment, Watchtower\u2019s Office of Public Information said, \u201cOur policies on child protection comply with the law, including any requirements for elders to report allegations of child abuse to authorities.\u201d Watchtower declined to comment on specific cases out of respect for the privacy of all involved.) Conti asked the elders to consider a plan she had devised for tracking child molesters within the organization. When they refused, she sued Watchtower, her former congregation, and Kendrick. During depositions, the elders admitted that they\u2019d long known Kendrick had a history of child molestation\u2014they knew before they paired him with Conti for door-to-door ministry, and before they rejected her story about the abuse. In 2012, a jury awarded Conti $28 million, believed to be the largest jury verdict ever for a single victim in a child-abuse case against a religious organization. (On appeal, judges reduced the damages to less than $3 million. Kendrick has always denied Conti\u2019s allegations.) Others had come forward with accusations against Watchtower before, but Conti refused to take a settlement, and the trial, with its blockbuster monetary award, became a major news story. In the years since, Watchtower has faced dozens of similar lawsuits from victims who say the organization\u2019s policies enabled and protected their abusers. In addition to the 1997 \u201cspecial blue envelope\u201d letter, these suits have cited a 1989 letter in which Watchtower discouraged elders from reporting wrongdoing to civil authorities. \u201cThere is \u2018a time to keep quiet,\u2019 when \u2018your words should prove to be few\u2019 (Ecclesiastes 3:7; 5:2),\u201d it read. \u201cImproper use of the tongue by an elder can result in serious legal problems for the individual, the congregation, and even the Society.\u201d\n\nIt was one such lawsuit that brought attention to the database.\n\nJos\u00e9 Lopez was 7 years old when he was molested by Gonzalo Campos, a fellow Witness whom the local elders had recommended as a mentor, despite knowing that Campos allegedly had a history of molesting young boys. When Campos assaulted Lopez in a La Jolla, California, home in 1986, the boy told his mother, who immediately reported Campos to the elders. They said they would handle the situation, and told her not to call the police. Yet Campos continued to rise in the organization, eventually becoming an elder. In 2010, he fled to Mexico, where he later confessed in a deposition to molesting Lopez and several other young boys. Lopez filed a lawsuit against Watchtower in 2012. When his lawyer, Irwin Zalkin, requested that Watchtower turn over all documents related to Campos and other known molesters, the organization at first refused, saying it lacked the resources to locate and sort all the information. But a senior official for Watchtower later testified that all the information had, in fact, been scanned and stored in a Microsoft SharePoint database. Zalkin introduced a software expert who testified that Watchtower should be able to produce the documents in as little as two days using simple search terms. Still, Watchtower did not comply. The judge grew frustrated and eventually barred the organization from mounting a defense, and handed Lopez a $13.5 million award. (An appellate court overturned the ruling, saying the judge should have sanctioned Watchtower incrementally; the case was settled for an undisclosed sum in January 2018.)\n\nWhen Zalkin raised the issue of the database in another case against Campos, in 2016, the judge ordered Watchtower to pay a fine of $4,000 a day until it handed over the documents. Watchtower racked up $2 million in charges before settling the case in February 2018.* Zalkin has once again requested the release of the database documents in another California case he\u2019s brought on behalf of a former Witness. Exactly how many alleged pedophiles are named in the database has been the source of wide-ranging speculation. In 2002, one former elder said the number was 23,720. (Watchtower would not comment on the number at the time except to say that it was considerably lower.) During the Lopez trial, a Watchtower attorney estimated that the organization had received 775 blue envelopes from 1997 to 2001, but did not say how many it had received since then. Perhaps most tellingly, in 2015, an Australian investigation found that the perpetrators listed in the database represented 1.5 percent of that country\u2019s Witness population of 68,000. Assuming the percentage is comparable in the U.S., which has a Witness population of 1.2 million, the number of alleged American abusers in the database would be 18,000. U.S. authorities have so far taken no action against Watchtower, but other countries have launched investigations. In 2016, a royal commission in Australia found that Watchtower demonstrated a \u201cserious failure\u201d to protect children, including not reporting more than 1,000 alleged perpetrators of sexual abuse (more than half of whom have confessed to committing the abuse) and at least 1,800 victims in that country since 1950. In 2014, the U.K.\u2019s Charity Commission opened two investigations, one of which is ongoing. Last year, in the Netherlands, then\u2013Justice Minister Sander Dekker urged Watchtower to conduct an independent investigation into hundreds of abuse allegations received via a special hotline. Watchtower declined.\n\nBy the time Mark told Kimmy about the Conti trial, in August 2014, she was starting to see things differently, too\u2014enough that she decided to read the trial transcript. \u201cIt was like someone just punched me in the stomach,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt was like this whole crack happened in my head.\u201d Mark knew that Kimmy had suffered physical and psychological abuse at the hands of her mother, who was mentally ill, but Kimmy didn\u2019t talk about it much. Now she began to open up. She told Mark about how her mother would lock her and her two siblings in their bedrooms or the basement for days with no food and only a litter box for a toilet. How she would keep them up all night by banging on pots and pans, then send them to school delirious and malnourished. She was also physically abusive toward Kimmy\u2019s father, who worked long hours and was largely unaware of how his wife was treating their children. \u201cShe would beat us every which way you can imagine. Scream at us, cuss at us for hours and hours and hours,\u201d Kimmy said. There was sexual abuse, too, which Mark hadn\u2019t known about. (My attempts to contact Kimmy\u2019s mother for comment were not successful.) Like many abusers, Kimmy\u2019s mother used animal cruelty to keep her kids from telling anyone. She would drown kittens in the toilet, then hang the corpses from a ceiling fan in their bedrooms or place them in a jar by their bed, \u201cmaking the point that she could kill us if we didn\u2019t cooperate or we told,\u201d Kimmy said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m always trying to rescue cats,\u201d she added, laughing darkly. \u201cThat\u2019s some easy psychology there.\u201d But Kimmy did tell. As a 12-year-old, she went to the elders in her congregation for help. They told her she couldn\u2019t report her mother to the police, \u201cbecause it would make the organization look bad,\u201d she recalled. They discouraged her from seeking counseling, because a therapist might blame the religion or get the authorities involved. Finally, the elders asked Kimmy a question: If her mother did end up killing her, could that prevent Jehovah from resurrecting her at Armageddon? \u201cOf course, I said no,\u201d Kimmy said, rolling her eyes. \u201cThey told me, \u2018Go home and obey your mother.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe told again at 15, after she\u2019d been baptized. This time, the elders said they would need a second eyewitness before they could intervene. Kimmy offered her brother\u2014who has corroborated Kimmy\u2019s allegations for this story\u2014but was told that his testimony wouldn\u2019t be credible, because he wasn\u2019t baptized. \u201cIt was my word against my mother\u2019s word,\u201d Kimmy said. Years later, she would learn that her brother had already reported the abuse to the same elders. Kimmy had heard of the two-witness rule, but she\u2019d assumed it was a peculiarity of her local congregation. When she read the transcript of the Conti trial, she discovered that it was Watchtower doctrine and had been used for decades to prevent other abused children from getting help. \u201cThe scales fell off my eyes,\u201d she said. Soon, both she and Mark would leave the organization for good. Over the next couple of years, the implications of Kimmy and Mark\u2019s decision became apparent. One of Mark\u2019s employees quit. Two of the couple\u2019s tenants moved out in the middle of the night. Close friends stared at their feet when Kimmy ran into them at Walmart. \u201cI went and hid three rows down and cried,\u201d she told me. Mark\u2019s relationship with his parents, always strained, disintegrated. His business faltered. He and Kimmy had some savings to fall back on and would find other tenants. But in his mid-40s, with no college degree or r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mark faced an uncertain future.\n\nOn a lark, he emailed Lloyd Evans, the British activist with the YouTube videos. Mark told Evans his story and thanked him for the work he was doing. To his surprise, Evans wrote back, suggesting some online ex-Witness groups he should join. Still wary of being labeled an apostate (neither he nor Kimmy had been officially disfellowshipped, though they\u2019d stopped attending meetings), Mark joined Facebook under the pseudonym John Redwood\u2014an homage to Evans, whose pen name was John Cedars\u2014and began finding others with similar stories. As he connected with ex-Witnesses around the world, he was struck by how similar their accounts were to his own. He began writing about his experiences on Facebook. His posts spurred conversations among former Witnesses, giving him a new sense of purpose. In the summer of 2015, the ex-Witness community was transfixed by Australia\u2019s royal-commission hearings, live-streamed online, into sexual abuse in religious organizations. The commission had been trying to get testimony from a member of Watchtower\u2019s Governing Body\u2014the organization\u2019s all-male ruling council, which then consisted of eight men. By a strange twist of fate, one member, Geoffrey Jackson, was in Australia at the time, tending to his sick father. Watchtower had managed to avoid a subpoena by claiming that the Governing Body was strictly advisory and played no role in creating policy. Mark\u2014who had obsessively collected Watchtower literature his entire life\u2014had the evidence to prove this wasn\u2019t true. He dug out a copy of the \u201cBranch Organization Manual,\u201d an obscure document explaining all the functions of the Governing Body, and emailed it to Angus Stewart, the lead litigator in the proceedings. Stewart used the manual to subpoena Jackson.\n\nIn front of the commission, Jackson became the first active member of Watchtower\u2019s Governing Body to acknowledge that \u201cchild abuse is a problem right throughout the community.\u201d He also admitted that in most cases, children who make such charges against Watchtower are telling the truth. It was an emotional moment for those whose abuse Watchtower had denied. Mark received an email from Stewart saying that the \u201cBranch Organization Manual\u201d had proved to be crucial in securing Jackson\u2019s testimony. Perhaps, Mark thought, his extensive collection of Watchtower ephemera and his encyclopedic knowledge of the religion could be used for something other than recruiting.\n\nStill using his John Redwood pseudonym, Mark became a regular contributor to Evans\u2019s anti-Watchtower news site, JWsurvey.org. Trey Bundy, who has covered Watchtower\u2019s sex-abuse scandals for the Center for Investigative Reporting, invited Mark to speak at a 2017 conference on the topic in London that also featured Zalkin, the attorney, and Michael Rezendes, the Boston Globe reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize with his co-workers for their investigation of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. The conference marked the first time that Mark used his real name as an activist, figuring the Witnesses he knew in Baltimore were unlikely to hear about the small overseas gathering.\n\nMark also used JWsurvey, where he continued writing under his pseudonym, to encourage Witnesses to expose Watchtower\u2019s abuses\u2014a call that has yielded hundreds of emails. \u201cHe just comes off as so sincere and knowledgeable and articulate,\u201d says Faith McGinn, a former Witness and an abuse survivor who reached out to Mark last April. \u201cThat\u2019s what prompted me to finally come forward.\u201d Mark has built an international network of abused, disfellowshipped, and aggrieved Witnesses, whom he has connected to journalists, attorneys, and one another. \u201cMark is probably the key ex-JW in the ex-JW community,\u201d says Jason Wynne, the founder of AvoidJW.org. A Jehovah\u2019s Witness who has started doubting the religion\u2019s tenets but not yet left the organization is said to be \u201cphysically in, mentally out,\u201d or PIMO. In 2017, a PIMO man and his girlfriend began walking into Kingdom Halls in Massachusetts, opening locked file cabinets with a set of stolen keys, and removing or making copies of sealed documents. They had heard chatter about Watchtower covering up child abuse and, at first, simply wanted to see the evidence themselves. Most of the documents they took were letters between local elders and Watchtower headquarters, or from one congregation to another, discussing the alleged sins of individual congregants. One young man was disfellowshipped for stealing candy bars, another for refusing to remove a sign from his van window that said beating children violates God\u2019s law. A woman was disfellowshipped for having sex with her ex-husband when he came over to plow her driveway during a snowstorm.\n\nBut they also gathered dozens of letters dealing with accusations of rape, domestic violence, and molestation, including several questionnaires required by the 1997 \u201cspecial blue envelope\u201d letter. In total, 12 individuals are named as suspected child molesters, though missing documents make it difficult to piece together some of the stories. Not knowing what to do with the documents, the PIMO man\u2014who has requested anonymity and prefers the code name Judas\u2014posted a redacted version of a single letter he had stolen on an ex\u2013Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses subreddit. Just five sentences long, the letter informed Watchtower that a ministerial servant had admitted to physically and mentally abusing his wife for years. In the most recent incident, he beat her so badly that she would have sought medical attention, \u201cif it were not for her concern over the reproach it would bring on Jehovah\u2019s name.\u201d As punishment, the husband had been stripped of his rank and had lost all \u201cspecial privileges,\u201d like handling the microphone at Kingdom Hall meetings. No mention was made of involving police or taking steps to protect the wife. Judas had blacked out the names of the couple and the congregation, but not the date. \u201cIt was just one simple letter that shocked me,\u201d Judas told me. \u201cI wanted to see if this would get anyone\u2019s eyes who is really important and could tell me what I should do with this information.\u201d His plan worked. Jason Wynne saw the letter and sent Judas a private message, warning him that he could be exposing himself and others to legal trouble or harassment by posting sensitive documents online. Judas replied, asking for advice on how to release his other documents.\n\nAt Wynne\u2019s request, Mark reached out to Judas with a plan to release the information while still protecting his identity. Judas went to a distant post office and mailed him the documents in a USPS Priority Mail box with no return address. He also used secure channels to send scanned copies to Mark and Wynne. Though they wanted to eventually leak redacted versions of every document involving a criminal act, they decided to start with one big story: the case of a Witness man from the Palmer Congregation in Brimfield, Massachusetts, who allegedly abused his two daughters and another young girl. The story plays out across 33 letters\u201469 pages in all\u2014between the congregation and Watchtower headquarters. One of the man\u2019s daughters said he had tied her down and molested her; the other said he had raped her repeatedly for nine years. He allegedly took one of his daughters into the woods and showed her where he would bury each of her body parts if she told. The girl who wasn\u2019t his daughter said he raped her in his neighbor\u2019s mobile home when she was 4. At first, the elders took only nominal action because one of the sisters refused to accuse her father in person. In 2003, the elders finally disfellowshipped the man after he confessed to molesting one daughter. But he was reinstated a year later, partly because the daughter who had accused him of years of rape refused to answer new questions from the elders, who expressed disapproval in the letters that she and her husband had alerted civil authorities.**", "description": "A former Jehovah's Witness is using stolen documents to expose allegations that the religion has kept hidden for decades.", "authors": ["Douglas Quenqua", "Photography Lexey Swall"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/03/_DSC2098/facebook.jpg?1553216271"}
