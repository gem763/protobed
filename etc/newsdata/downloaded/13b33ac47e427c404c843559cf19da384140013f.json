Democrat impeachment investigators in the House are trying to determine if Trump coerced Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for aid. Trump and Ukraine have denied the claim\n\nDemocrats claim Trump attempted to use his power to influence the 2020 presidential elections by pressuring Ukraine to investigate corruption allegations against his rival Biden.\n\nEchoing testimony from former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, Sondland denied participating in the alleged campaign to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens on behalf of Trump.\n\nIn his opening remarks, he clearly stated:\n\nAgain, I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens. \u2026 Let me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong. Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\n\nNBC News indicated that Sondland did not break with Trump.\n\nLawmakers who witnessed his deposition \u201csaid his testimony did not appear designed to harm President Donald Trump so much as to insulate Sondland from the scandal,\u201d it reported.\n\nIt seems that Sondland\u2019s refusal to harm Trump with his testimony did not sit well with some Democrats.\n\nNBC News noted:\n\nE.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland isn\u2019t filling in as many gaps as lawmakers would have hoped, telling House committees that he can\u2019t recall various details surrounding the Ukraine scandal, according to three sources present for parts of his ongoing testimony Thursday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that he has been less than truthful throughout the day,\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), who witnessed Sondland\u2019s deposition, told NBC News, adding:\n\nI mean some of the things that he says he doesn\u2019t remember, it would be very hard to believe that he didn\u2019t remember, I mean very specific things that, you know, are unique to different situations that they\u2019ve discussed throughout the day. And unless has the worst memory. Or, and is, you know, far more far more incompetent than than one would think an ambassador to the European Union should be.\n\nEchoing Volker\u2019s testimony, Sondland reiterated that Trump ordered him and other envoys to work with his private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine policy.\n\nSondland testified that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the directive:\n\nIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani. \u2026 Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.\n\nDuring his deposition, Volker made it clear that he and Sondland were working with Giuliani on Ukraine at Trump\u2019s behest.\n\nTop U.S. State Department official George Kent indicated to impeachment investigators this week that the corruption allegations against the Bidens have merit. He said he warned the Obama administration that the Ukrainian company that hired Hunter was corrupt, but officials dismissed his concerns, the Washington Post reported.", "description": "Sondland asserted that he did not play a role in pushing the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/17ab73_us-ambassador-european-union-gordon-sondland-was-involved-in-efforts-pressure-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
