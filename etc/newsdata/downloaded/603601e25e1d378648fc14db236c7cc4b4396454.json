Neither he nor his lawyer responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe Seattle Times reported in September that Forkner repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not turn over documents subpoenaed by the Justice Department.\n\nBoeing said in a statement the company \u201cbrought to the Committee\u2019s attention a document containing statements by a former Boeing employee.\u201d\n\n\u2018I BASICALLY LIED\u2019\n\nForkner said in one text message, \u201cI basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly).\u201d The other employee responded that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a lie, no one told us that was the case\u201d of an issue with MCAS.\n\nForkner responded soon after: \u201cGranted I suck at flying, but even this was egregious.\u201d At one point Forkner said \u201cthere are still some real fundamental issues\u201d in the simulator.\n\nThe FAA plans to turn over more communications from Forkner to Congress later on Friday, sources said.\n\nBoeing is revising the 737 Max software to add more safeguards and require the MCAS system to receive input from two key sensors.\n\nThe FAA reiterated that it is \u201cfollowing a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 Max to passenger service. The agency will lift the grounding order only after we have determined the aircraft is safe.\u201d\n\nAirline profits worldwide are taking a hit as 737 Max jets are grounded, forcing over 100 daily flight cancellations at large U.S. operators like Southwest Airlines Co and American Airlines.\n\nSouthwest, which on Thursday delayed the return of the plane to its schedule until February, said on Friday it was unaware of the internal messages but continued to work with Boeing and the FAA \u201cin their shared pursuit of safety.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee confirmed it will question Muilenburg at an Oct. 29 hearing, one day before a House of Representatives panel is scheduled to question him.\n\nBoeing shares fell 6.7 per cent after the Reuters report, helping to drag down the Dow Jones industrial average to a session low.\n\nFederal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation\u2019s inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 Max\u2019s certification.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Sources told Reuters the Boeing messages raised questions about the performance of the MCAS anti-stall system that has been tied to two fatal crashes", "authors": ["David Shepardson"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/boeing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
