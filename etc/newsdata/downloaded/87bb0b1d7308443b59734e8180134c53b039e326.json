Everyone on board was hurt, and five people suffered critical injuries.\n\nTwelve tourists remained hospitalized as of Saturday, including one who was on life support, according to police and hospital officials. Intermountain Healthcare spokesman Lance Madigan declined to provide an update Monday on their conditions.\n\nAbout 18 family members of people who were killed or injured were preparing to travel to the U.S., U-Tour said.\n\nU.S. investigators were researching the driver\u2019s background, license qualification and medical history. He is a U.S. citizen from California, officials have said, but his name has not been released. He didn\u2019t appear to be intoxicated, the Utah Highway Patrol has said.\n\nThe bus had seat belts, but it\u2019s unknown if any passengers were wearing them, according to Pete Kotowski, investigator-in-charge for the NTSB.\n\nThe bus company\u2019s inspection history, hiring practices and corporate safety culture are also under investigation, Kotowski said.\n\nThe operator of the bus, Ontario, California-based America Shengjia Inc.. was cooperating with investigators examining what caused the mid-sized 2017 bus to crash.\n\nThe licensed company has two vehicles and two drivers, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Records show no history of previous crashes involving the company founded in 2015.\n\nThe company has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nThree women and one man died in the crash. The victims have been identified as Ling Geng, 68, Xiuyun Chen, 67, Zhang Caiyu, 62, and Zhongliang Qiu, 65, according to the Utah Highway Patrol.\n\nThe group of 29 tourists and one leader came from Shanghai and the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, according to a news report on the media website huanqiu.com.\n\nThe News Perspective program, part of the Shanghai Media Group posted photos of parts of the itinerary indicating the accident occurred on the seventh day of a 16-day trip that also included visits to Yellowstone National Park, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas. The group was scheduled to fly to the East Coast after the western U.S. stops.\n\nMillions of people visit Utah\u2019s five national parks every year. More than half of visitors from China travel on tour buses, said Vicki Varela, managing director of Utah Office of Tourism.\n\n___\n\nMcDonald reported from Beijing.
