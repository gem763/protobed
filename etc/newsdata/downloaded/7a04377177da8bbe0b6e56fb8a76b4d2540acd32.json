He was scheduled to fight in Melbourne in February but pulled out with an undisclosed illness. So the 28-year-old has put himself through the hardest preparation of his career.\n\n\u201cOn the back of what happened last time I just jumped back into training with a fervor,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cI focused on my strength, my conditioning, focused on my health, on my fitness and just honestly, I\u2019ve thrashed myself this camp.\u201d\n\nOfficials said ticket sales are on track to match, if not exceed the world record attendance of 56,214 at the previous Melbourne UFC card in November 2015.\n\nWhittaker won on the undercard that day behind the Ronda Rousey and Holly Holm headliner won by Holm. Holm was scheduled to appear on Sunday\u2019s card, but was forced to pull out with a hamstring injury.\n\nSunday\u2019s lineup also features a fight between two world-ranked lightweights, American Al Iaquinta and New Zealand\u2019s Dan Hooker. Hooker is the most established Kiwi in the UFC ranks with 12 fights for the organization over the last five years.\n\nHooker fought in both UFC Fight Nights in Auckland in 2014 and 2017, but New Zealand has yet to host one of UFC\u2019s pay-for-view shows.\n\nWhittaker is currently rated ninth and Adesanya 14th in the pound-for-pound ratings.\n\n\u201cYou look at the winner of this fight in the top five pound-for-pound in the world,\u201d UFC chief Dana White said.\n\nWhen asked what he planned for the next few days, Whittaker replied: \u201cI\u2019m going to make the weight on Saturday. I\u2019m going to fight on Sunday, and I\u2019m going to go back to my kids on Monday.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Robert Whittaker says he's in the best shape of his career for his UFC middleweight world title defense against Israel Adesanya.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
