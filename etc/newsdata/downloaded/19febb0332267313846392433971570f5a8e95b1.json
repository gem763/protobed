A similar aversion towards the privileged financial elite in the City of London helped fuel the Brexit revolt.\n\nAnd, of course, antagonism towards the banks was evident in Australia even before the Hayne royal commission shone a spotlight on the greed and cupidity in the financial sector.\n\nAfter all, the banks were the biggest individual losers from the 2017 federal budget, which stung them with a new $6.2 billion bank levy.\n\nSince June, the Morrison government's frustration with the big banks has intensified, after they failed to pass on official rate cuts in full to their existing home loan customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo scorching is the political fury that Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has now directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take a close look at home loan pricing, and the obstacles that prevent customers from switching banks.\n\nOf course, the country's more astute bankers are well aware of the extent to which community and political sentiment towards their industry has soured.\n\nThey know that the only way for them to survive is to keep their head down and focus on managing their massive organisations, while trying to avoid inflaming public opinion even further.\n\nIt's against this volatile and incendiary backdrop that the banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has unveiled its new pay regime, according to which only 50 per cent of a senior banker's bonus can reflect financial performance.\n\nEven though the new remuneration rules have been widely panned, APRA boss Wayne Byres has responded by calling on critics to come up with a better suggestion \"that isn't just the status quo, because outcomes from the status quo have been found unacceptable''.\n\nBut although senior bankers have been stunned by Byres' stance - which suggests that the banking regulator feels it is under such strong pressure to make changes to bankers' pay arrangements that it is prepared to push ahead with a deeply flawed policy rather than leave things as they are - they daren't risk any public criticism.\n\nThis leaves top bankers in the absurd situation where they have little choice but to adopt APRA's faulty remuneration rules, and to apply them in as sensible a fashion as possible.\n\nTheir only consolation is that although APRA's plan for rejigging bankers' bonuses will ultimately come unstuck, at least the changes Byres is proposing fall a long way short of Elizabeth Warren's policies.", "description": "The political momentum of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is symptomatic of the global backlash against bankers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8023%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_296%2C$y_6/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4682c0974bd105f9470e28da98ffab126ad0d02e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
