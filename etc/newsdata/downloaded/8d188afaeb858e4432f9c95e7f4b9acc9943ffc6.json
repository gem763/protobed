The Liverpool manager was innocently asked whether Mohamed Salah could be a little less selfish in front of goal. His big white grin gave the game away.\n\nKlopp had already confirmed that Mane was not simply unhappy because he had been substituted. Now, this knowing smile suggested that Salah\u2019s failure to pass on one late Liverpool attack was indeed the reason behind Mane\u2019s strop. It was not the first time that day that Salah had opted to shoot with a teammate in a better position, either.\n\nRoberto Firmino arguably had an even greater cause for complaint and Klopp had certainly felt so. When Salah fired tamely into Nick Pope\u2019s arms rather than find Firmino in space inside the box, an exasperated Klopp berated him from the other side of the pitch. Salah\u2019s excuse was that he had not heard Firmino, judging by how he waved a cupped hand to his ear in response.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The previous December, Mane was roundly criticised for not squaring to Salah in a Merseyside derby at Anfield and instead firing well wide.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Since Salah\u2019s arrival, the pair have passed to each other roughly the same number of times, but whereas Mane has created 43 chances for Salah, he has received just 25 in return. This was not his first show of discontent either. Mane appeared particularly annoyed with one wayward Salah shot in the 5-0 win over Huddersfield Town in late April.\n\nBut even if Klopp had appeared unhappy with Salah at times on Saturday, he was much more philosophical on his player's apparent reluctance to pass afterwards. \u201cI could describe five or six situations where everyone thought: \u2018Pass it, pass it, pass it,\u2019 and then he scored,\u201d he argued. \u201cSo, that is the freedom of the player. The boys have to make these decisions: pass the ball, don\u2019t pass the ball.\n\n\u201cWe can make these mistakes,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can lose the ball and mis-kick the ball or sometimes you cannot see your teammate. It is not that you ignore him. Sometimes to us it looks like you must see him but you don\u2019t. It is not a big challenge, but of course with a striker always you can have this. What you do depends on the situation.\u201d\n\nAnd then, for all the hysteria around this subject of his 'selfishness', Salah was in fact Liverpool\u2019s greatest creative force against Burnley. Only Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold made more passes in the final third at Turf Moor. No Liverpool player made a greater percentage of their passes in that area. No player fashioned more chances than Salah\u2019s four. And if you want a greater sample size than one game, Salah's total of 68 chances created last season was more than any other member of Klopp\u2019s squad.\n\nTensions like those seen on Saturday are not always evidence of disharmony within the ranks. Sometimes, they are the cost of bringing a group of single-minded and competitive attacking players together. Klopp may have been reluctant to share all the details of the spat with reporters, but his lack of concern was still genuine. As long as they keep performing and winning, he will be happy.\n\n\u201cIn one week, I don\u2019t think I will talk about it again,\u201d the Liverpool manager suggested with a smile on Saturday night. He will more than likely be proved right about that.", "description": "Jurgen Klopp did not want to fully explain Sadio Mane\u2019s angry Turf Moor outburst in either his television interviews or post-match press conference but a little later, his smile revealed all.
