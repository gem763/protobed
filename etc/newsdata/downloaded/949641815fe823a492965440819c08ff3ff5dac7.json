The agreement didn\u2019t even require the Taliban to commit to a cease fire\u2014all it had to do was promise not to allow Afghan territory to be used as a base for terrorist operations against the U.S. It merits emphasizing the \u201cagainst the U.S.\u201d part of the equation, because what that would have blared to America\u2019s allies all over the world was that the U.S. is willing to separate its interests from those of Afghans and of countries that have been fighting alongside the U.S. in Afghanistan these 18 years. \u201cAmerica first\u201d really does mean sacrificing the interests of others.\n\nFrom the Taliban\u2019s perspective, this was a terrific deal\u2014America accepting defeat, striking a bargain with them that excluded the elected government of Afghanistan. The U.S. would have abandoned the prospects for a democratic Afghanistan, as well as progress in education and women\u2019s rights, and consigned the country to Taliban rule, since the reductions in military support would almost certainly have led to that outcome. The Taliban would have had to recognize the Ghani government, but it could have afforded to do that since it would soon, no doubt, have overthrown it.\n\nThe president has now declared the negotiations dead. But he seems no less committed to withdrawing U.S. troops, since he subsequently tweeted that the U.S. military should not be \u201cserving as policemen in Afghanistan.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Kori Schake", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Great-Deal-Taliban"], "top_image": ""}
