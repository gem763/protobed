People were spitting at him and stuff like that.\n\n'I went to get the ball out of the goal after they scored the penalty and then a Yeovil player was telling their fans to calm down because the game might get called off, which obviously nobody wanted.\n\nHaringey players confront the travelling supporters during the FA Cup qualifying clash\n\n'I was with him, just telling them to calm down and that's when they started getting more aggressive and throwing stuff, swearing and all sorts and when I heard the racist comment, that's when I got upset and it all kicked off. The fan said \"black c\" word.'\n\nThe FA's on-field regulation team launched an investigation moments after the abandonment. The priority will be to establish the facts before any decision is made on the status of the match.\n\nThey have sought observations from the officials and both clubs and are in regular contact with the police.", "description": "Two men in their 20s have been arrested by police following reports of racist abuse during Saturday's FA Cup qualifier between Haringey Borough and Yeovil Town.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/08/19955622-0-image-a-38_1571641621024.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
