Back when they were just low-tech Game Boy games they still operated in what was essentially an open world, where you got to explore as you please and collect and train pok\u00e9mon in whatever way you thought best. So when modern open world games, everything from Skyrim to Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, started to appear it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine what it would be like if Pok\u00e9mon adopted a similar approach.\n\nThat\u2019s not what Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield is, but it does get a lot closer to that imagined ideal than any game before it \u2013 which is exactly what you\u2019d hope and expect from the first mainline Pok\u00e9mon game to appear on anything other than a portable-only console.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe recently got to play a whole hour and a half of Pok\u00e9mon Sword, almost from the very beginning. (As usual the two versions are almost identical, with the major difference being a handful of unique pok\u00e9mon to encourage trading). The only thing we weren\u2019t allowed to see was a brief part of the introduction, after which we were thrown into the world of Galar \u2013 a new region not featured in any game before and which, as usual, is inspired by a real-world location. In this case the UK.\n\nYou start off in an idyllic-looking cottage, which between the rolling hillsides and flat cap-wearing locals is purposefully reminiscent of Northern counties such as Yorkshire and Lancashire. As usual, the story in Pok\u00e9mon games is thinly told and this time seems to revolve around a relative who is a champion pok\u00e9mon trainer and who competes in Galar\u2019s giant-sized Dynamax stadia.\n\nThe more interesting part of the story comes shortly after the introductions are over and you go searching for a missing Wooloo (a sheep-like pok\u00e9mon that rolls like a ball) in the nearby Slumbering Weald. We can\u2019t tell you what happens when you get there, but let\u2019s just say it starts a mystery a bit more intriguing than who\u2019s going to win the Pok\u00e9mon championship.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThose initial story beats aside we spent the rest of our time exploring and capturing pok\u00e9mon in the traditional manner. Or at least traditional at the start. The area around your cottage and the nearby town has fixed camera angles and has you moving along narrow pathways in much the same way as Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon on the 3DS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe graphics, as you can tell from the videos, are by no means the best on the Switch but some areas, such as your home, are very nicely detailed and clearly show that developer Game Freak have been to the UK and done their research (the game\u2019s lead artist is also British).\n\nThis is also evident in the dialogue, which is filled with British mannerisms, where kids refer to things as being \u2018pants\u2019 or talk about their mum instead of \u2018mom\u2019 (although curiously they still use American spelling). We asked, and apparently this will be the script used in the American version of the game, which, oddly, will make Sword and Shield one of the most overtly British games to ever hit the mainstream. They\u2019ve even got the obsession with curry, tea, and the weather right.\n\nThe one problem we do have with the dialogue though is that there\u2019s no voice-acting at all, which there really doesn\u2019t seem any reason for. We have an interview with producer Junichi Masuda and director Shigeru Ohmori going up next week, where we ask them about this, but it feels especially odd \u2013 and cheap \u2013 when characters\u2019 mouths are flapping about uselessly during the pre-rendered cut scenes.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nGame Freak have never been a very technically capable developer and while this is the best-looking Pok\u00e9mon game so far there are certainly no envelopes being pushed in terms of the visuals. The battles in particular will disappoint many as while the animation is quite good the way it\u2019s presented is still the same as always, going back all the way to Pok\u00e9mon Stadium. And yet, when we got a bit further, we came to the \u2018Wild Area\u2019, which is perhaps the most intriguing part of the game, both visually and in terms of gameplay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Wild Area is a fairly large open world location, which The Pok\u00e9mon Company rep on hand estimated was about the size of two regions from Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. Here you do have control of the camera and can see pok\u00e9mon roaming about on their own, as bees flit around flowers, fish pok\u00e9mon jump in the lakes, and larger creatures such as Onix \u2013 which you\u2019re warned not to get close to because they\u2019re too high level \u2013 wander about freely.\n\nAs such, there are now three main ways to encounter pok\u00e9mon: seeing them out in the open (which also happens outside the Wild Area) and approaching them like in Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, getting attacked at random in long grass, and when you see an exclamation or question mark that indicates a rare or unusually aggressive/inquisitive pok\u00e9mon. This seemed to cover all bases and you can even creep slowly through grass if you don\u2019t want to disturb it or whistle if you want to purposefully attract pok\u00e9mon.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Sword/Shield \u2013 the Wild Area seems like the best part of the game\n\nOn the assumption that its later evolutions would probably be cooler we chose Sobble the water lizard pok\u00e9mon as our starter but quickly got together a party of more common pok\u00e9mon. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not allowed to tell you about any of the new ones we saw, and we\u2019re also not allowed to say which old ones are present either, beyond the information already known. Although you can see Xatu, Lotad, Hoot Hoot, and Pelipper in the footage released today, which ironically we didn\u2019t encounter while playing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat we can say is we liked almost all the new designs and if you just think about some common British birds and mammals all the obvious ones are represented via pok\u00e9mon equivalents. That includes the one Galarian variant we did spot: the new Zigzagoon and Linoone that now look much more like British badgers than they did originally.\n\nThe turn-based combat works essentially the same as always and, unlike Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, you do have to chip away at pok\u00e9mon\u2019s health and capture them manually. The presentation makes everything as clear as possible for newcomers but nothing seems to be dumbed down in terms of combat. Although what will raise eyebrows is that every pok\u00e9mon in your party earns experience at the same rate automatically, without the need for Exp. Share or any other external factor.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nDynamaxing (but not Gigantamaxing) is introduced surprisingly early and allows you to grow any pok\u00e9mon to giant size for a few rounds, increasing their stats and powering up a unique move each. This is most useful in Max Raid Battles, a new four-player co-op system inspired by Pok\u00e9mon GO. The Wild Area is dotted with little rock piles that are lairs for naturally dynamixing pok\u00e9mon, which can only easily be beaten as a team. The online options weren\u2019t turned on for our playtest though, so we had to put up with some so-so computer allies.\n\nThe Wild Area is dotted with little rock piles that are lairs for naturally dynamixing pok\u00e9mon, which can only easily be beaten as a team. Although the online options weren\u2019t turned on for our playtest so we had to put up with some so-so computer allies. Competing in raid battles rewards you with an in-game currency called watts, although what exactly this is used for we didn\u2019t really get to see.\n\nIn the Wild Area we could see the little interface for the \u2018Y-Comm\u2019 online app pop up, indicating that under normal circumstances you would be able to communicate and play with other people online, in what seems to be a much freer manner than previous games. This is also possible when you set up a camp, which we were able to do, where you can cook a curry for your pok\u00e9mon and play around with them in a first person view and even tempt wild ones into your party.\n\nUnfortunately, the hour and a half was over all too quickly and we were left desperately wanting more, which is of course the best sign possible. Pok\u00e9mon fans, like most gamers, are never happy and we\u2019re sure there\u2019ll be complaints about the graphics and the minutiae of the gameplay but the bottom line is that this is the biggest step forward the series has seen in a long while. Whether all those steps are wise ones we\u2019ll have to see, but Pok\u00e9mon is evolving and Sword and Shield represents its most impressive form so far.\n\nFormats: Nintendo Switch\n\nPublisher: Nintendo/The Pok\u00e9mon Company\n\nDeveloper: Game Freak\n\nRelease Date: 15th November 2019\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Gigantamax Pikachu, Meowth, Eevee, Butterfree, and Charizard officially revealed for Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield\n\nMORE: Galarian Ponyta is Pok\u00e9mon Shield exclusive, equivalent to Sirfetch\u2019d\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: are pok\u00e9mon being made into sausages?", "description": "GameCentral gets to play an hour and a half of Pok\u00e9mon Sword and discovers a host of new pok\u00e9mon and the new open world area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SWSH_Art-d62f_1571319613.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
