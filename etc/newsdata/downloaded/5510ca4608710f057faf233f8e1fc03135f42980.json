He should immediately apologise for this disgraceful comment about Liverpool, and the tragedy at Hillsborough and the implied insult to the Bigley family.\"\n\nFollowing the publication of the piece, then Tory leader Michael Howard ordered Mr Johnson to visit the city and apologise.\n\nHe then said: I think the article was too trenchantly expressed but we were trying to make a point about sentimentality. It's a kick in the pants for me.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe day after he became PM, Mr Johnson failed to apologise for the comments when confronted by Liverpool MP Maria Eagle.\n\nShe said: \"He said he wants to govern for the whole of the country, but in a previous role the Rt Hon Gentleman has accused my constituents of wallowing in their victim status, repeated offensive and proven untruths about the cause of the Hillsborough disaster and called Liverpool self-pity city.\n\n\"So will he now apologise from the dispatch box to the people of Liverpool for the offence that he has caused?\"\n\nBut Mr Johnson's answer failed to address the issue.\n\nHe said: \"I ask the Honorable lady to look at my political record and look at what we've achieved and look at what I've done as a one-nation Conservative, helping with policies that are uniformly delivering better outcomes for the poorest and neediest in society - and that is what I stand for and that is what I believe in and that is what this whole government is going to deliver.\" f", "description": "The PM - who authorised a infamous rant about the city while editor of the Spectator in 2014 - was on Merseyside for talks with Irish PM Leo Varadkar", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Andrew Teebay Liverpool Echo", "Andy Stenning", "Daily Mirror", "Afp Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20552115.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-BREXIT-POLITICS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
