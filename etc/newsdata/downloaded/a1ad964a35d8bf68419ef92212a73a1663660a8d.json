mainland China for trial.\n\nClashes with police have become increasingly violent as the demands evolved into a wider call for democracy.\n\nDemonstrators threw petrol bombs at officers last weekend and police retaliated with water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and batons. Nearly 1,200 people have been detained so far.\n\nDozens of protesters took to the streets overnight after the withdrawal of the bill was announced, shouting: \u201cFive key demands, not one less.\u201d\n\nLocal media reported that protesters built barriers near a police station at Mong Kok and pointed laser beams at police but fled after riot police confronted them.\n\nStudents also reportedly staged protests outside some schools Thursday, forming human chains across streets to show their support for those detained by the government.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The airport has been the site of several protests, causing flight disruptions and cancellations, as protesters seek to drum up international support.\n\nThe mostly young protesters say a degree of violence is necessary to get the government\u2019s attention after peaceful rallies were futile. Chinese officials have warned that Beijing will \u201cnot sit idly by\u201d if the situation worsens.\n\nMs Lam also announced other measures including opening a platform for dialogue with society to try to address other deep-rooted economic, social and political problems, including housing and mobility for young people, that she said were contributing to the current impasse.\n\n\u201cWe must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions,\u201d she said.\n\nIn response to the demonstrators\u2019 demands for an independent inquiry, Ms Lam said the independent police complains council was credible enough to address the probe.\n\nThe announcement came after it was revealed Beijing had thwarted Ms Lam\u2019s earlier proposals to withdraw the bill and she had said privately she would resign if she could, according to a leaked audio recording.\n\nThe protests are the biggest popular challenge to Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s rule since he took power in 2012. China denies meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs and accuses Western countries of fuelling the unrest.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong have vowed to return to the streets until all five of their demands are met, after an extradition bill responsible for months of protests was withdrawn.
