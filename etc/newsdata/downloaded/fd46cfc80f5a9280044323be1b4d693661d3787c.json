And recently, inaccurate and misleading stories about the 7-year-old - who was born a boy but whom the mother says identifies as a girl - have circulated in blogs, Facebook posts, YouTube videos and petitions, bringing attention to a usually private matter. The father asked to be the parent who makes decisions about the child following a disagreement over how to raise the child.\n\nThe Associated Press is not naming the 7-year-old to protect the child\u2019s privacy.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott tweeted Wednesday evening that the attorney general\u2019s office and Texas Department of Family and Protective Services were looking into \u201cthe matter\u201d of the child. And on Thursday, Attorney General Ken Paxton said he was asking Family and Protective Services to investigate for possible child abuse.\n\nHowever, Judge Kim Cooks in Dallas said Thursday during a hearing that the court noted no abuse, neglect or family violence in the case. She said the parents would continue to share custody and would make joint decisions about the child.\n\nThe judge scolded the father, who she noted was unemployed, for seeking publicity on the case and raising money on his website, but she also pointed out how the mother testified that her encouragement of the child being transgender may have been excessive.\n\n\u201cThe father finds comfort in public controversy and attention surrounded by his use of unfounded facts and is thus motivated by financial gain,\u201d Cooks said, adding that the gain came \u201cat the cost of the protection and the privacy of the children.\u201d\n\nMuch of the public reaction to the case has focused on backing the father\u2019s narrative. On his website, he pleads for help to \u201csave\u201d his child, with a headline saying he\u2019s fighting \u201cchemical castration and sex-change of his son.\u201d\n\nA post of a woman holding a baby shared widely on Facebook targets the mother, saying she \u201calways wanted a girl.\u201d\n\nCooks said Thursday that no Texas court or judge has ordered \u201cthe chemical castration, puberty blockers or any transgender reassignment surgery on this child to become female.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Georgulas, who is a pediatrician, said before the hearing that she was \u201cbeing viciously attacked and threatened by complete strangers based on false and untrue statements.\u201d Cooks said she limited spectators to only the media at the hearing because of safety concerns.\n\nEarlier this month, Georgulas filed a proposed parenting plan that said the child isn\u2019t yet at an age where treatment with hormonal suppression, puberty blockers or transgendered reassignment surgery is considered. And she asked the court to not allow any such treatment without the consent of both parents.\n\nDr. Stephen Rosenthal, medical director for the University of California San Francisco\u2019s Child and Adolescent Gender Center, says that often when parents disagree about potential treatment it\u2019s \u201clikely because there\u2019s a possibility that they may be misinformed about what the treatment actually is\u201d or if medical treatment would even be considered at the child\u2019s age.\n\nHe said a puberty blocker temporarily puts puberty on pause and is a safe medication that has most commonly been given to kids who go into puberty much too early. He said that before the onset of puberty, there\u2019s \u201cno role\u201d for medical intervention in a person who might be transgender.\n\nRosenthal added that not every child who identifies as transgender before puberty will continue in identifying that way after it starts.\n\nCooks said the court found that both parents love their children, and she noted the 7-year-old appears comfortable as a male or female.\n\nYounger told the AP before Thursday\u2019s hearing that the child identifies as a boy when at his house.\n\nAsked after the hearing if he was happy with the outcome, Younger didn\u2019t comment and only smiled and nodded.\n\n___\n\nSilber reported from Austin, Texas.
