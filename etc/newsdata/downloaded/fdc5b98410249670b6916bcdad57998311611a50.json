I respect the Navy's decision. With the love and support of my family, I'm moving forward.\"\n\nAfter tragedy struck the family through 46-year-old Beau's death from cancer in 2015, Hunter's personal life remained in the headlines.\n\nAfter he divorced his first wife and the mother of his three daughters Kathleen, the Biden family acknowledged he was dating Hallie Biden, Beau's widow.\n\nHunter raised eyebrows with a candid New Yorker interview in which he said he spent the aftermath of his brother's death on a bender that included him buying crack from homeless people. He also said that he and Hallie discovered they were \"sharing a very specific grief\" and spent a lot of time together in 2016, before they became a couple.\n\nThe couple apparently tried to keep the relationship secret, but the former vice president found out when Page Six called him for comment on a story on the relationship, after which he and Jill issued a supportive statement.\n\n\"We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness,\" the statement said. \"They have mine and Jill's full and complete support and we are happy for them.\"\n\nIt's unclear when Hunter and Hallie Biden stopped dating, but their breakup was reported in early May, shortly before TMZ reported the \"secret\" wedding between Hunter and South African model Melissa Cohen, which happened on May 16.", "description": "See how Hunter rose through the ranks of Washington to land in President Donald Trump's latest scandal.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d87ad8e2e22af1bf20d1373-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
