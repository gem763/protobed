While climate activism has been around for years, the effort has recently been reshaped and reinvigorated by an infusion of vocal young people who have quickly become the face of the movement.\n\nThe most prominent of these young activists is Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old from Sweden whose one-person strikes on Stockholm inspired last week\u2019s worldwide demonstrations. Last week, she chided U.S. lawmakers to \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d warning about climate change. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the United Nations climate summit where she tore into world leaders for their inaction. \u201cHow dare you continue to look away and come here saying you are doing enough,\u201d she said.\n\nHer speech was enough to draw the attention of President Trump, who mocked her on Twitter. She used his gibe as the inspiration for a new Twitter bio.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nThe youth climate movement, with Thunberg as its de facto figurehead, has inspired people of all ages who believe their unapologetic \u2014 at times apocalyptic \u2014 rhetoric may be able to force change where other environmental activists have come up short.\n\nYoung people present a compelling argument, some argue, since they\u2019ll be living with the consequences of climate change long after older generations are gone. They also represent a large demographic that is mostly in agreement on the issue and will soon become a significant voting bloc.\n\nOthers are less convinced. There are those who believe that major action on climate change is not needed. But there are reservations even among those who are sympathetic to the youth movement\u2019s cause.\n\nTurning passion into action, some argue, may prove difficult when young activists run up against the entrenched political and corporate forces that have stymied environmental action for decades. Others accuse the youth movement of lacking practical solutions to implement their demands and for using an aggressive tone that may alienate members of older generations.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nThunberg and 15 other youth activists have filed a complaint with the U.N. accusing five countries of violating their human rights by not taking action on climate change. If their case succeeds, it could establish new a new precedent for how the international community may push back against nations that are seen as not doing their share to protect the planet.\n\nPerspectives\n\nBelievers\n\nYoung people are inspiring older generations that have become jaded.\n\n\u201cMy hope stems largely from the recent, unprecedented groundswell of youth activism that has raised public consciousness to new levels and is pushing political leaders to develop bold and ambitious ideas to confront this challenge.\u201d \u2014 Former Vice President Al Gore, Time\n\nThey have fundamentally changed the conversation on climate action.\n\n\u201cSomething has changed, thanks to you and to the young people who have brought new urgency and vision to the climate movement. Many people have become concerned and awake for the first time, and the conversation we need to have is opening up.\u201d \u2014 Rebecca Solnit, The Guardian\n\nNew possibilities have arisen thanks to young activists.\n\n\u201cThe youth climate activism movement has over the past year exploded prior notions of what\u2019s possible in the realm of climate politics.\u201d \u2014 Brian Kahn, Gizmodo\n\nTheir movement is powerful enough to swing elections.\n\n\u201cSure, a protest isn\u2019t the same as policy, but so much of politics is narrative power. Simple messages resonate. They can gain enough momentum to put people in office.\u201d \u2014 Heather Hansman, Outside\n\nGreta Thunberg is already the world\u2019s most recognizable environmentalist.\n\n\u201cGreta [Thunberg] has had an impact more than all the other environmentalists in the world put together. Just a child, the innocence of her message, she cuts through it all.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Environmentalist David Suzuki to CBC\n\nTheir aggressive approach makes complacency a more difficult option.\n\n\u201cAs you grow older \u2014 I\u2019m 37 \u2014 you start to numb to some of the violation. And I don\u2019t want to be numb. I want to stay, I think, in that harder and braver space, that brokenhearted place. And I\u2019m really feeling inspired and informed by the lens that\u2019s being used by youth leadership.\u201d \u2014 Sarah Myhre, Slate", "description": "Young activists, led by 16-year old Greta Thunberg, have brought new energy into the fight to combat climate change.
