The Redskins may be bad right now, but if you start your day with some football, here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nOpponent: New England Patriots (4-0)\n\nWhere: FedEx Field, Landover, Md.\n\nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 6, 1 p.m.\n\nTelevision: CBS\n\nRadio: The Team 980, ESPN 630AM\n\nWhat to watch for:\n\n- The drama is inescapable: Who will Washington start at quarterback? Part of the question comes down to health: Colt McCoy returned to practice last week, while Case Keenum was wearing a walking boot for his injured foot in recent days. When McCoy was still out with a leg injury, the debate was Keenum vs. Dwayne Haskins, and whether the first-round pick is ready to play. Coach Jay Gruden has been criticized for his handling of Haskins and made waves Wednesday when he said on a conference call that he didn\u2019t have a plan for quarterback yet.\n\n- Landon Collins and the Redskins\u2019 defense have allowed offenses to convert on third down 63 percent of the time (34-for-54) after four games. That\u2019s last in the league, even worse than the Miami Dolphins. Not being able to make a drive-ending stop has kept Washington\u2019s defense on the field longer, tiring them out. \u201cWe\u2019re making those plays count,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe just have to be one step closer in the plays that work for us. We have to continue pushing that play.\u201d\n\n- A message from Captain Obvious: The Patriots are still one of the best teams in football. Tom Brady did struggle against the Buffalo Bills\u2019 defense last week, but defending champion New England is nonetheless viewed as one of the favorites to win Super Bowl LIV. The Patriots are 3-1 against the Redskins during the Brady era and opened the week as 15-point favorites to win. If that happens, two very different teams will walk out of FedEx Field after the game: one 5-0, the other 0-5.\n\n- Injury report: Washington could be down its top two tight ends. Jordan Reed remains sidelined with a concussion he suffered in late August, but Vernon Davis joined the list with a concussion of his own. Josh Norman missed Thursday\u2019s practice with a knee injury, but Gruden said his concern level for Norman was \u201cvery low.\u201d\n\nPre-game reading:\n\nListen closely to Jay Gruden, and you can hear the contempt in his answers pertaining to the #Redskins quarterback situation https://t.co/SzpzabEznj \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) October 3, 2019\n\nNo QB or coach and cure the culture crippling the #Redskins, @thomloverro writes. https://t.co/EeNJp16ARJ \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) October 2, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
