It's beautiful to watch,\" said sales executive Rajesh Kamble, who admitted he was still trying to figure out the sport.\n\nThe game may have confused some, but the entertainment was familiar territory -- Bollywood dances replaced cheerleader routines and a Mumbai hip-hop group took over the floor before the tip-off.\n\nThe courtside audience included celebrities such as Bollywood superstar Priyanka Chopra-Jonas. The biggest ovation of the night however was for NBA legend Larry Bird, whose presence brought the crowd to its feet.\n\n- What happens once 'circus' leaves? -\n\nBut questions remain about how much the NBA -- whose 2017-18 season revenue was a staggering $8 billion, according to Forbes -- is willing to invest in India and whether its audience will be restricted to hardcore fans and wealthy urbanites.\n\n\"The fact that the circus has come to town is a great thing,\" said Vishal Jhunjhunwala, partner at Mumbai-based sports marketing firm, Square Consulting.\n\n\"But what happens once the circus leaves town?\n\nSacramento Kings player Yogi Ferrell shoots during game against Indiana Pacers at the NSCI Dome in Mumbai\n\n\"You need a local connect, a superstar with Indian roots for basketball to take off. That doesn't exist at the moment, unlike say China where the presence of a star like Yao Ming galvanised his whole country into following the sport,\" Jhunjhunwala told AFP.\n\nNo Indian player has ever taken part in an NBA game and although NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters that he hopes to see that change within five years, few are holding their breath.\n\nAnd, unlike cricket which is played everywhere from India's slums to members\u00b4 clubs, basketball enjoys a limited appeal in the country of 1.3 billion people.\n\nThe cheapest ticket for Saturday's game cost 4,500 rupees ($65), going up to an astronomical 85,000 rupees for courtside seats. In comparison, a season pass for next week's second Test between India and South Africa in Pune tops out at 5,000 rupees.\n\nAlthough the high price did not deter well-heeled sports fans, analysts say the NBA risks losing out on a huge chunk of India's audience if it doesn't build up mass appeal.\n\n\"You are asking people to spend a lot to watch a sport they don't know much about,\" said Jhunjhunwala.\n\nTo those in the stands, however, the spectacle was well worth the big bucks.\n\n\"I am a cricket fan but... basketball also has huge potential and hopefully this is the start of a new sporting journey\", said 25-year-old Danish Contractor.\n\nIn his comments, the NBA's Silver said the games \"required us bringing in a court, a scoreboard, seats, locker rooms\" to Mumbai.\n\nThey will have to do much more if the sport is to have a long-term future in the country, experts say as the NBA pre-season Asia tour now heads off to Japan and China for further matches over the coming week.\n\n\"One game isn't going to turn India into a basketball-loving nation. But it's a first step,\" said Jhunjhunwala.\n\n\"If they lose money on it, well, they have deep pockets\".", "description": "Seconds after the NBA's first games in India ended, the packed Mumbai stadium erupted with cheers as spectators -- some of whom were still struggling to...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/06/wire-19352338-1570338454-118_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
