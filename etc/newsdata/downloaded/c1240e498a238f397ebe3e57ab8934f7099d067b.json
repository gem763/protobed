(AP) - Grand Forks, North Dakota, may be 500 miles from Minneapolis, but it\u2019s still deep in Vikings country.\n\nSo some folks are surprised when Alan King swings open the door to his basement New Orleans Saints shrine, a workout room wallpapered from floor to ceiling with black and gold memorabilia.\n\n\u201cMy friends get a kick out of it,\u201d the die-hard Houma-born Saints fan said. \u201cBut they call me crazy, of course.\u201d\n\nIf King was really crazy, he\u2019d probably be the first to know it, because he\u2019s a professor of psychology at the University of North Dakota. He said he wore a Saints cap and Steve Gleason jersey for his university website photo.\n\n\u201cI wear Saints stuff, but it\u2019s not appreciated,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that King, 63, is a Saints fan. He earned his degrees at LSU and interned at the Veterans Administration hospital in New Orleans. When he took the job in Grand Forks in 1987, he immediately invested in a satellite dish to follow the home team.\n\nHis wife, Kathy, who hails from New Jersey, understands his lifelong passion, though she doesn\u2019t quite share his football obsession. However, his four grown kids, especially the two youngest boys, seem to have inherited the Who Dat gene.\n\nIn 2009, as the Saints marched toward their first Super Bowl victory, King said he was facing a personal health crisis.\n\nOverweight and suffering from kidney stones, King knew he had to slim down and reclaim his strength. The Saints\u2018 impossible season set King on the right path, he said. If the long-suffering team could triumph, he reasoned, so could he.\n\n\u201cIt was a miraculous thing,\u201d he said, \u201cthey inspired me.\u201d\n\nKing bought an elliptical stepping machine and placed it in an unused basement room. As he embarked on his exercise regime, he also began collecting Saints mementos: jerseys, newspaper front pages that celebrated the team and hundreds of fan photographs.\n\nA friend purchased a football online that had been signed by several members of the New Orleans team and gave it to King as a gift. He also has a prized photo of himself with coach Sean Payton and the Super Bowl trophy, taken on one of his annual trips to New Orleans.\n\nAnd he has a set of small NFL helmets representing the Saints opposition, which he turns upside down when the teams are defeated.\n\nSurrounded by symbols of his heroes, with music blaring from six speakers, King stepped and stepped and stepped for 10 solid years, eventually losing 30 pounds and feeling fit enough to come in off the sidelines in a crucial game if the coach needs him.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the psychology of fandom, he said. \u201cAs Saints fans, we think we might be called up at any time.\u201d\n\nKing, his brother and his oldest son were in the front row in 2006 when Steve Gleason rallied all of New Orleans by blocking a punt against the rival Atlanta Falcons in the team\u2019s return to the Superdome after a 20-month exile caused by Hurricane Katrina damage.\n\nAll fans say to themselves, \u201cmaybe I can block a punt someday,\u201d King said.\n\nBeing an expatriate Who Dat \u201cis about identity,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s about who you want to be associated with. I see Saints fans when I travel, and it\u2019s like we\u2019re part of the same family. It\u2019s about fellowship. It is a nation. It is.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Grand Forks, North Dakota, may be 500 miles from Minneapolis, but it's still deep in Vikings country.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Maccash", "The Times-Picayune", "The New Orleans Advocate"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
