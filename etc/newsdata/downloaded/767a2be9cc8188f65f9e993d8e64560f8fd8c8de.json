Rand Paul (R-KY), in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, responded to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) naming him as her \u201csurprising friend\u201d during the fourth Democrat debate.\n\n\u201cYes! I made the Democratic Debate, isn\u2019t that great?\u201d he joked. But more seriously, he said, \u201cAs a person, I like Kamala, and I think one of the things is that the media and the Internet have to make it where we all hate each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I work with Kamala on some things like bail, I think things ought to be fair, I don\u2019t think people ought to be locked up for life. I think poor people who can\u2019t get an attorney shouldn\u2019t rot in jail, whereas a rich person might get out \u2014 you know her parents or somebody might have money to get us out of jail,\u201d he said about the former California attorney general.\n\n\u201cPoor people rot in jail sometimes when they\u2019re innocent, and so I\u2019ve worked with her on it and I think it\u2019s one of those things that is misrepresented that we can\u2019t get along. Doesn\u2019t mean we agree, doesn\u2019t mean we split the difference, but can\u2019t we get along, can\u2019t we go out and have a beer, get along, and you might be for something I\u2019m not for, but we say, \u2018Well she\u2019s for that, I\u2019m for something a little bit different, and we still can be friends,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also weighed in on another 2020 Democrat candidate \u2014 and one he is ideologically diametrically opposed to on socialism, about which he just authored a book, titled, The Case Against Socialism.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dislike them \u2014 I work with Bernie,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch of the book is how I don\u2019t like Bernie\u2019s socialism, but on issues of war? I don\u2019t like war and I don\u2019t think we should be involved in most of the wars in the world and I\u2019ve sided with him. I don\u2019t want arming Saudi Arabia in the Yemen War. I think Yemen is one of the poorest countries on the planet. I don\u2019t want to aid or abet any war there, so I work with him.\u201d\n\nPaul said politicians in Washington get along better than most people think, and slammed the \u201ccesspool of hatred\u201d on the Internet.\n\n\u201cThe real cesspool of hatred is the Internet. Frankly, people on the Internet just \u2014 they\u2019re anonymous and you read down all the comments and everybody\u2019s hateful and it\u2019s like, what are all these people doing, do they not have a life \u2013 all they got to do is spew hatred for people that they hate online?\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he was glad Harris named him as her surprising friend.\n\n\u201cI was kind of glad that she threw it out, because I do want to be known as somebody who\u2019s not unreasonable and can get along with people on the other side of the aisle.\u201d\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Paul in an exclusive interview responded to Harris naming him as her \"surprising friend\" during the fourth Democrat debate.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Rand-Paul-Faith-and-Freedom-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
