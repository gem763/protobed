Obama loyalists\n\nWarren\u2019s greatest strength is that she is genuinely her own person, something she demonstrated during the early years of the Obama administration when she fought furiously with his economic advisors to be tougher on the banks and give more attention to the ways that stabilizing the financial system was insufficient to restore economic health. It was a vital practical issue as much as an issue of justice, and she wasn\u2019t daunted in the slightest by going to battle with her own party over it. Because of this history, she is uniquely positioned to cut the legs out from Trump\u2019s argument that he is a necessary disruptor of the system, and to seize the mantle of change rather than restoration.\n\nBut of course, an argument for \u201cdeep structural change\u201d implicitly criticizes the popular former president, whether for failing to achieve that change or for failing to try. That\u2019s a potential problem for her as she seeks to consolidate support from moderate Democrats in general \u2014 and from black voters in particular. And Biden will do everything he can to make it as big a problem with as many voters (and party leaders) as he can.\n\nWarren has been careful not to attack Biden for this very reason \u2014 indeed, she\u2019s been notable for rarely attacking anybody in her party. But when the argument is brought to her, she\u2019s going to have to figure out how to turn it to her advantage \u2014 by shifting the subject from the past to the future. The question isn\u2019t whether Obama made the right choices in 2009 or 2010 or 2014 or whenever. What would he do now, knowing what he does now, about what worked and what didn\u2019t, and what the consequences were?", "description": "", "authors": ["Noah Millman", "Theweek.Com Articles Elizabeth-Warrens-Path-Victory"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
