The ground is dry. It\u2019s been dry for a while here as we\u2019ve come through summer,\u201d Lindner said. \u201cThe initial parts of this rainfall will go toward saturating the ground.\u201d\n\nKen Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center, said the Houston area and parts of the upper Texas coast and East Texas could get significant rainfall through Thursday as the storm moves north. Imelda\u2019s rain bands were also stretching into Louisiana.\n\n#Imelda Key Message: This system is likely to produce life-threatening flash flooding along portions of the Upper Texas Coast, including the Houston and Galveston areas.

Harvey dumped nearly 50 inches (130 centimeters) of rain on parts of the flood prone city in August 2017, flooding more than 150,000 homes in the Houston area and causing an estimated $125 billion in damage in Texas.\n\nWhile there could be some isolated structure flooding in the Houston area, widespread house flooding from Imelda \u201cdoesn\u2019t look likely at this point,\u201d Lindner said.\n\nHowever, he said residents who live in flood prone areas should still be mindful and take extra precautions.\n\nOfficials in the Houston area were preparing high-water vehicles and staging rescue boats Tuesday.\n\nThe storm, which formed Tuesday, made landfall near Freeport, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. Some parts of Harris County and neighboring Galveston County had already received about 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain through Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe Galveston school district announced it was canceling classes on Wednesday.\n\nIn a tweet Tuesday, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner asked residents to be \u201calert and weather aware.\u201d\n\nGov. Greg Abbott on Monday placed numerous resources on standby across Texas. The Texas Division of Emergency Management will be rostering four boat squads in coastal areas. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will be moving boats to support the Beaumont area and adjacent regions.\n\nMeanwhile Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Humberto in the Atlantic Ocean is posing a stronger threat to Bermuda, though it was more than 500 miles (804 kilometers) away. Meteorologists also said newly formed Tropical Storm Lorena in the Pacific Ocean could produce heavy rains and flooding in Mexico by Thursday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.
