We'd been looking forward to it all day.\"\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\nShe said she had been taking her children to the pool every week since they were babies and had never had an issue before with being on her own.\n\n\"They need to rethink the policy,\" she said. \"There's numerous people with kids who are by themselves and it's such a great facility for them.\n\n\"It's discriminating against single parents.\"\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\nKirsty, who lives in Hedon, said she had taken a half-hour bus journey and walked 20 minutes from the bus stop to get to the pool as her kids were off school for half term.\n\nShe said she then had to queue outside the leisure centre with several other families.\n\n\"We had to queue outside in the cold for 20 minutes,\" she said. \"We got to the front and someone asked what the kids' ages were and what our postcode was.\n\n\"The kids were getting upset and this woman was not sympathetic at all, she was quite abrupt actually.\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\n\"When kids are used to going there and then get turned away like that, they were in tears.\"\n\nShe said she had even brought her nieces and nephews to the pool before and never had a problem.\n\n\"The thing is, swimming is a cheap option,\" she said. \"It's so sad to think I'm not going to be able to bring my kids.\n\n\"A lot of people in this community are single parents who don't have people they can just produce to be able to do things like this.\n\n\"You can't just say, 'Oh can you come swimming with me to watch the kids?' It's embarrassing.\"\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\nA spokeswoman for Hull Culture and Leisure said: \"Hull Culture and Leisure has recently reviewed policies for swimming pools and follow the safety guidance recommended by the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity (CIMSPA).\n\n\"Policies are in place to provide a safe environment for our customers.\n\n\"Adults are permitted to supervise a maximum of two children under eight years old when using learner pools (situated at Woodford, Beverley Road and Ennerdale).\n\n\"When activities are taking place in large pools, including Woodford's wave pool, adults can supervise a maximum of two children who are aged four to eight years old, or can supervise one child aged three or under.\"", "description": "Kirsty Bearfield, 24, says the new policy by Woodford Leisure Centre in Hull discriminates against single parents", "authors": ["Nathan Standley", "Image", "Katie Pugh"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754860.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DSC_4560.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
