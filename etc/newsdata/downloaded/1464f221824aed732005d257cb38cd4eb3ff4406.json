I remember everything like an elephant. I was in the nosebleeds and now I made his nose bleed,' he gloated in victory.\n\nAdesanya's journey from the nosebleeds to world champ started when his well-off parents decided to move out of Lagos to give their children a better education.\n\nHis father Femi, an accountant, and Taiwo, a nurse, were tossing up between the U.S. and New Zealand and ruled out America after the September 11 attacks.\n\n'I went to Rotorua Boys' High School and there's a lot of testosterone. It was ups and downs, smiles and frowns,' he told Sporting News.\n\n'It was weird being the only black kid around. I had to defend myself a lot.\n\n'I'm cheeky, I'm annoying so I'd always get myself into trouble and eventually I had to learn how to defend myself. That's when my search for fighting came through.'\n\nAdesanya's journey from the nosebleeds to world champ started when his well-off parents decided to move out of Lagos to give their children a better education (from L-R Adesanya, David, Deborah, Bolu and Samuel)\n\nAdesanya said he struggled to fit in and never felt accepted in his adopted country because of his race and being an African immigrant.\n\n'Literally there was a point through high school where I used to try and sound like [my classmates], I used try and be like them and talk like them,' he said last year.\n\n'Just so I can fit in. I tried so many times to fit in but I could never ever fit in. I was always like, an outcast.\n\n'At the end of the day, look at my skin. I'm all black and ironically that's the country's national rugby team's name.\n\n'I was never able to fit in properly and be accepted when I was a kid.'\n\nSchool was also the origin of Adesanya's notorious swaggering self-confidence that made him such a loudmouth in and out of the ring.\n\nFour fighters knocked back the chance to face him in his first UFC bout until Australian brawler Rob Wilkinson took him on\n\nSchool was also the origin of Adesanya's notorious swaggering self-confidence that made him such a loudmouth in and out of the ring.\n\nHe started giving himself motivation pep talks, and first to get through the day and then to push himself to become a champion fighter.\n\n'I think I was crying in the mirror one day after being picked on,' he told the New Zealand Herald.\n\n'I was upset and I just kind of talked to myself and then eventually I just started doing it. I've been doing it for years now.\n\n'I don't like eating my own words and I like rubbing it in people's faces.'\n\nIn another interview he also attributed some of his his divisive attitude to his African upbringing.\n\n'I think it's a trait of people from my place. We don't shy from flaunting our abilities, even if we fall flat on our face, we still put it out there,' he said.\n\n'It ain't bragging if you can back it up, and I've been backing it up for years now, so I can say what I want and do what I want.'\n\nAdesanya had trained briefly in taekwondo in Nigeria but his mother pulled him out of class when he broke his hand.\n\nAlmost a decade later he started to learn kickboxing after being inspired by the Muay Thai film Ong-Bak.\n\nAdesanya had trained briefly in taekwondo in Nigeria but his mother (pictured together) pulled him out of class when he broke his hand\n\nGrowing up he also excelled at dancing, which is always a feature of his entrance to the ring, and believes he could have been just as good if he chose that path professionally\n\nGrowing up he also excelled at dancing, which is always a feature of his entrance to the ring, and believes he could have been just as good if he chose that path professionally.\n\n'There were plenty of young black men like me dancing, but in UFC there was a market for me,' he told Stuff.\n\nIn 2009 he went against his trainer's advice and competed in an amateur MMA fight which he lost but didn't embarrass himself.\n\nSpurred on by his loss, Adesanya moved to Auckland aged 21 and began training under his current coach Eugene Bareman.\n\nBareman was hesitant at first as he was part of Adesanya's support team in 2009 and found the young fighter too stubborn to deal with.\n\nAdesanya started fighting professional kickboxing bouts in 2011, a career which he continued at the same time as MMA until 2017, amassing a 75-5 record.\n\nHe toiled mostly in obscurity for most of his MMA career, beginning in 2012, and only got his first UFC opportunity last July after already winning 11 straight bouts.\n\nFour fighters knocked back the chance to face him in his first UFC bout until Australian brawler Rob Wilkinson took him on.\n\nAdesanya dismantled him in just the second round and was victorious in another five fights before he won the right to challenge Whittaker.\n\nAdesanya dismantled Whittaker in just the second round and was victorious in another five fights before he won the right to challenge Whittaker\n\nAdesanya didn't take long to start bragging, and almost immediately challenged Paulo Costa, who was in the audience, to be his next opponent.\n\n'You know who's next. I got this overly inflated balloon animal. This heavy-a*** Ricky Martin wannabe. Borrhaccina,' he said.\n\n'You better not step in here 'cause this is my f**king cage tonight. It's my octagon. Trust me, when I'm done with him, he'll really look like Ricky Martin: botched.'\n\nSoon after he threw more insults at Costa and all the fans - and anyone else really - who doubted him.\n\n'The casuals, they're dumb. They see a beefed up beefcake like [Costa] and think 'that's the guy',' he said.\n\n'I'm still all hype, by the way. Don't worry, I'm just a hype train. So yeah, they'll see that and think 'That's the guy! That's the guy!'\n\n'They just want to see me lose, but they're going to be waiting a long time.'", "description": "New UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya was just 10 when his family uprooted him from Nigeria to an all-white school in New Zealand.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/07/19382914-0-image-a-38_1570431111293.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
