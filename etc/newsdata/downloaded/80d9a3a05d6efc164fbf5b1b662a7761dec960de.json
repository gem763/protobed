This lady knew about the problem but couldn\u2019t come to terms with it.\n\nThen in the spring I found out I had lung cancer and shortly after I had a heart attack.\n\nWhile all this was going on, her messages petered out and she told me eventually she only wanted to be friends which I accepted.\n\nThen, out of the blue, it was all over \u2013 I couldn\u2019t contact her, she wouldn\u2019t answer my calls or reply to my texts.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago, I bumped into her while she was walking a dog and she told me I didn\u2019t exist any more.\n\nI feel so hurt, lost and upset \u2013 how do I carry on and get this woman out of my head?\n\nColeen says\n\nI can see the end of this friendship has come as a huge blow and you must be feeling it a lot as you\u2019re battling these health problems.\n\nYou\u2019ve been hit from all sides and it\u2019s tough and feels cruel.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, at this point you don\u2019t need someone in your life who isn\u2019t committed.\n\nIt\u2019s a distraction from what you should be doing \u2013 focusing on your wellbeing and using your energy to fight your way back to health.\n\nI think what she did wrong was to leave you dangling, saying the \u00adrelationship was over but she wanted to be friends when she didn\u2019t want that either.\n\nPerhaps she was trying to let you down gently, but it\u2019s made things worse because she\u2019s given you hope.\n\nIn terms of moving on, time is a great healer.\n\nNow you know it\u2019s over, you can focus on bringing positivity into your life and relying on people you know are there.\n\nDon\u2019t shut yourself off \u2013 invite people in for their support.", "description": "After falling for a younger woman she has brutally rejected me because of my major health problems", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571501.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS90331301.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
