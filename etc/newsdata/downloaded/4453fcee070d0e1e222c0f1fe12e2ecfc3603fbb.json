Milan have shot themselves in the foot four times this season already by having to dig out a result with 10 men.\n\nPepe Reina, Mateo Musaccio and Davide Calabria (twice) have all been sent off and only three of seven Serie A games have they finished with their full complement of players.\n\nClearly this can't continue at the current rate and without beating themselves, they'll find the points begin to accrue.\n\nPioli pledged to bring 'ideas, intensity and bravery' to the club in his first interview and as long as that bravery buzzword doesn't spill into something overzealous, then AC Milan should clean up their act in this area.\n\nMateo Musacchio (right) is shown one of four red cards given to AC Milan this season\n\nTake a leaf out of Jurgen Klopp's book\n\nPioli often cuts a suave figure on the touchline and even used to kit himself out in a purple turtleneck under his suit during his tenure at Fiorentina.\n\nIf there are any sartorial shackles on the touchline in Milan, he needs to break them and convince the skeptical ultras he is absolutely committed to their cause.\n\nHe needs to bring energy and breathe life into the team as well as enlivening the fans from his technical area. Many of the supporters are waiting for him to fail and #Pioliout was trending in Italy after his appointment.\n\nNone of that is the manager's fault but his behaviour could go a long way to helping the naysayers to forget his previous allegiance to Inter and get behind him.\n\nIf his players feel they have a ready-made excuse to down tools with the fans against their manager, he needs to counteract that narrative as quickly as possible.\n\nThe suave Italian needs to be a busy presence on the touchline and inspire his new players\n\nGet Rafael Leao and Krzysztof Piatek to gel\n\nAC Milan splashed out \u00a326million on Rafael Leao in the summer and the 20-year-old is rated among the top young prospects in Europe.\n\nThe skilful Portuguese forward opened his account against Fiorentina with a breathtaking individual effort, skinning three defenders before slotting home and Pioli has to find a way to get him into the side.\n\nThe trouble is, under Marco Giampaolo, the relationship with fellow forward Krzysztof Piatek was awkward and Milan have lost every game the strike partnership started together.\n\nPiatek's qualities on paper should complement Leao, who is more of a free-moving threat and can create something out of nothing.\n\nIf Pioli can find a better way than Giampaolo to get the duo singing off the same hymn sheet, the goals will begin to flow again.\n\nA couple of very good goals from Portuguese players yesterday.\n\n\n\nRafael Le\u00e3o scored his first goal in an AC Milan shirt - and what a tremendous one it was to kick things off.

It's difficult to say in truth as his average tenure in charge of the 13 clubs he's managed is 1.07 years.\n\nIt will be tricky for him to gather a firm idea of his best formation and selection so early in the job but the chopping and changing was part of Giampaolo's downfall.\n\nThe season started with a 4-3-1-2, then switched to a 4-3-2-1 and then reverted to an orthodox 4-3-3.\n\nPlayers need time to build familiarity with the tactics they're being told to carry out - Pioli's message needs to be clear and simple. Perhaps then his key tenets of 'ideas, intensity and bravery' will be allowed to flourish.", "description": "Stefano Pioli is the ninth new AC Milan manager in five years, only fierce rivals Inter has his win percentage risen narrowly above 50 and he has a mammoth job on his hands.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/22/19559658-0-image-a-11_1570742626398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
