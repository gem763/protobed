Prograis and Taylor are both unbeaten world champions in the super-lightweight division and their unification contest at the O 2 Arena should be riveting.\n\nI interviewed both men last week and they offer an intriguing study in contrast. Taylor, a 28-year-old Scot who lives just outside Edinburgh, is likable yet concentrated in his searing focus on Prograis, while also revealing a passion for motorbike racing. The 30-year-old Prograis, meanwhile, is erudite and laconic. He discusses books and history, poverty and morality. In London he has visited the Churchill War Rooms and plans were made for him to meet the historian Andrew Roberts. An unlikely encounter between a heavily tattooed American boxer and Churchill\u2019s biographer didn\u2019t happen this time but it\u2019s an example of Prograis\u2019s difference to most fighters.\n\nJosh Taylor: \u2018I was always smaller than everyone \u2026 I would fight them straight away\u2019 Read more\n\nPrograis and I have emailed each other regularly over the past few months and I have been sending him a stream of books which he has read and written about in interesting ways. His desire to read, and to one day write a book himself, is at the heart of our exchange. Prograis also highlights his voracious appetite for reading as one of the reasons why he will handle the unsettling intensity of this fight.\n\n\u201cI love reading about the psychology and history of boxing,\u201d Prograis says. \u201cHaving read so much about intimidation it seems to me that Taylor is more intimidated than I am. If you look at his body language, you can see it. He\u2019s very intense. I\u2019m so cool. I\u2019m collected. You can\u2019t bother me. When I told him: \u2018You try to look at me all mean, but that don\u2019t matter,\u2019 I think it bothered him. He is used to being an intimidator at this weight [140lb] because he\u2019s so tall and with a long reach. I can see how he could intimidate some people. But I come to him with a lot of knowledge, a lot of skill and a lot of power.\u201d\n\nPrograis looks strong but he smiles when I mention the size difference between him and Taylor. \u201cI always fought bigger people. It comes easy to me. I told Taylor straight: \u2018Even if you have all those advantages, you still can\u2019t beat me. You can be stronger, you can be faster, you can hit harder, you\u2019re obviously taller and you got the longer reach. That doesn\u2019t matter. None of that stuff wins the fight.\u2019 It comes down to skill and will. He is talking much more angrily that I am. I think that was because, when the fight got postponed while I sorted out my contract, he was convinced I was scared of him. That was never was the case. It was about the money.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Regis Prograis takes on Josh Taylor at the O2 on Saturday evening.

I came over early to be well-adjusted to the weather, the people, the food, the time difference, everything. He sees now I am really serious. It\u2019s not a game. I am ready and I am not scared of him one bit. It\u2019s understandable that he should be more worried than me.\u201d\n\nPrograis, who is from New Orleans, talks in a relaxed drawl which hides the menace of a fighter who has knocked out 80% of his opponents. Does he feel any animosity towards Taylor, who has spoken of how Prograis will \u201cget chinned in a dog fight\u201d? He shakes his head: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nDoes it help a fighter if he is driven by resentment or dislike of his rival? \u201cNot for me. I always fight calm. You want to hurt the opponent, of course, but I never think of damaging him. So I don\u2019t have to be mad at them. For me, fighting is just something I love to do.\u201d\n\nFourteen years ago, in August 2005, Prograis\u2019s life changed for ever when his family home and much of New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. His family lost everything and he had to start a new life in Houston \u2013 where boxing became his salvation. \u201cEveryone wants me to say Katrina was hard,\u201d Prograis suggests. \u201cI was 16 so it definitely forced me to grow up early. Looking back, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. It\u2019s hard for me to look at it as a bad thing because so much good came out of it. It changed my life for the better.\n\n\u201cBut, at the time, it was a shock. It was like: \u2018You were here in New Orleans, your life was like this and that\u2019s it. That life is gone for ever. Wiped away.\u2019 You can type in your zip code and see your area. We did it because we were seeing all the hurricane stuff on the news. We were seeing water drowning the city. But we didn\u2019t know if our exact location was full of water. So we typed in the zip code and our house was like a lake. Our whole neighbourhood was under water. Where I lived in New Orleans was right next to a lake and you couldn\u2019t tell the difference. I knew we\u2019re never going back there again.\n\n\u201cFor me and my sister it was fun because we were out of school. It was like vacation. We were used to hurricane season every year and the warnings to evacuate. You got to put tape on your windows, fill your gas tanks up, get water. Then nothing happens. You might get a tree knocked over. That happened a few times over the years but this was different. The mayor was on the news and he said: \u2018It\u2019s gonna be like Hurricane Betsy.\u2019 When Hurricane Betsy happened [in 1965] my grandma remembers her and her daddy getting around in boats. She said: \u2018If it\u2019s going to be like that, we gotta go.\u2019 That\u2019s why we left the day before Katrina.\u201d\n\nHis New Orleans roots still run deep. \u201cIt\u2019s home,\u201d Prograis says simply. \u201cWhere I come from, the people around you determine your success. Of course we all want money. When I was young I always looked at rich people and thought: \u2018I wanna have those things.\u2019 Katrina took away everything we had, and we did not have much, but as I get older I realise it\u2019s the people that matter. It\u2019s the relationships you have, the love you have.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\n\u201cI once looked at my grandparents as being unsuccessful. They had nothing. They were always real poor. She was a maid for 25 years. When we used to leave for school we would drop her off \u2013 at the house she used to clean. My grandpa worked two jobs for 40 years. He was a janitor and he worked on the garbage truck. At first you think those are not good careers. But if you look at my grandma and grandpa, they succeeded in life because everybody loves them. My grandma calls everybody every day. She talks to everybody. That\u2019s just how she is. I\u2019m a fighter but I try to be like that because it\u2019s the right way.\u201d\n\nPrograis had started boxing in New Orleans a few months before Katrina but when his family moved to Houston he embraced this dark old trade. Boxing and books soon became the cornerstones of his new life. \u201cBecause I started boxing late I was at a disadvantage. I had to catch up. And, for me, catching up was reading and studying. Everybody works hard in the gym. But you got to think about what\u2019s outside the gym. When you done training, what\u2019s going to be the difference? For me, it\u2019s your mind.\n\n\u201cI learned that Mike Tyson was a student of the game. I thought: \u2018I wanna do that.\u2019 So I just watched thousands of fights. Almost all the greatest fighters you can name, I watched all their fights from their pro debut to their last bout. I also started reading. I read about someone who was trying to go to the Olympics and they substituted TV for books. At one time I was probably watching five hours of TV a day. I was like: \u2018Damn, imagine if I read that much. Imagine how much I will know.\u2019 I started doing that. Of course I don\u2019t read as much as I used to because I got two kids and I\u2019m busy now. But when I first started, I was reading six, seven hours a day. Read, read, read. I would lose myself in books. Now I got a shit-load of books.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Regis Prograis and Josh Taylor square up at the Weigh-In.

He picked up a new book which goes well with the two I give him when we meet again on his last day of sparring.\n\n\u201cThe kids and my wife are only coming to London just before the fight, so I have got so much reading time right now,\u201d he says. \u201cThat has to be a good thing.\u201d\n\nVicious and hurtful punches, rather than books, will occupy his mind on Saturday night. But as he tries to emulate his boxing heroes who fought all over the world \u2013 from Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson to Roberto Duran and Tyson \u2013 Prograis will draw deep on all the words he has read about courage and desire. There will be times when it will feel as if a storm has engulfed the ring. But Prograis survived Katrina and discovered boxing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cI know this is a big night that could make my life even better. I\u2019m ready.\u201d Prograis looks up and smiles. \u201cAnd, after I win, I can go out and get a much bigger bookshelf.\u201d", "description": "The WBA super-lightweight champion says the disaster \u2018took away everything\u2019 but forced him to grow up, and explains why he will treat himself to a new bookshelf if he beats Josh Taylor on Saturday", "authors": ["Donald Mcrae"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01aae4dc3a70c234220047191039a4c199ac9c2b/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6a9c8f9e2dcc7dfac92e7e63f5ceb7e", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
