His blood pressure was a bit high, but everything else looked good, and he exercised regularly. Then he had a scare. He went for a brisk post-lunch walk on a cool winter day, and his chest began to hurt. Back inside his office, he sat down, and the pain disappeared as quickly as it had come. That night, he thought more about it: middle-aged man, high blood pressure, stressful job, chest discomfort. The next day, he went to a local emergency department. Doctors determined that the man had not suffered a heart attack and that the electrical activity of his heart was completely normal. All signs suggested that the executive had stable angina\u2014chest pain that occurs when the heart muscle is getting less blood-borne oxygen than it needs, often because an artery is partially blocked. Listen to the audio version of this article: Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles.\n\nA cardiologist recommended that the man immediately have a coronary angiogram, in which a catheter is threaded into an artery to the heart and injects a dye that then shows up on special x-rays that look for blockages. If the test found a blockage, the cardiologist advised, the executive should get a stent, a metal tube that slips into the artery and forces it open. While he was waiting in the emergency department, the executive took out his phone and searched \u201ctreatment of coronary artery disease.\u201d He immediately found information from medical journals that said medications, like aspirin and blood-pressure-lowering drugs, should be the first line of treatment. The man was an unusually self-possessed patient, so he asked the cardiologist about what he had found. The cardiologist was dismissive and told the man to \u201cdo more research.\u201d Unsatisfied, the man declined to have the angiogram and consulted his primary-care doctor. The primary-care physician suggested a different kind of angiogram, one that did not require a catheter but instead used multiple x-rays to image arteries. That test revealed an artery that was partially blocked by plaque, and though the man\u2019s heart was pumping blood normally, the test was incapable of determining whether the blockage was dangerous. Still, his primary-care doctor, like the cardiologist at the emergency room, suggested that the executive have an angiogram with a catheter, likely followed by a procedure to implant a stent. The man set up an appointment with the cardiologist he was referred to for the catheterization, but when he tried to contact that doctor directly ahead of time, he was told the doctor wouldn\u2019t be available prior to the procedure. And so the executive sought yet another opinion. That\u2019s when he found Dr. David L. Brown, a professor in the cardiovascular division of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The executive told Brown that he\u2019d felt pressured by the previous doctors and wanted more information. He was willing to try all manner of noninvasive treatments\u2014from a strict diet to retiring from his stressful job\u2014before having a stent implanted.\n\nThe executive had been very smart to seek more information, and now, by coming to Brown, he was very lucky, too. Brown is part of the RightCare Alliance, a collaboration between health-care professionals and community groups that seeks to counter a trend: increasing medical costs without increasing patient benefits. As Brown put it, RightCare is \u201cbringing medicine back into balance, where everybody gets the treatment they need, and nobody gets the treatment they don\u2019t need.\u201d And the stent procedure was a classic example of the latter. In 2012, Brown had coauthored a paper that examined every randomized clinical trial that compared stent implantation with more conservative forms of treatment, and he found that stents for stable patients prevent zero heart attacks and extend the lives of patients a grand total of not at all. In general, Brown says, \u201cnobody that\u2019s not having a heart attack needs a stent.\u201d (Brown added that stents may improve chest pain in some patients, albeit fleetingly.) Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of stable patients receive stents annually, and one in 50 will suffer a serious complication or die as a result of the implantation procedure. Brown explained to the executive that his blockage was one part of a broader, more diffuse condition that would be unaffected by opening a single pipe. The cardiovascular system, it turns out, is more complicated than a kitchen sink. The executive started medication and improved his diet. Three months later, his cholesterol had improved markedly, he had lost 15 pounds, and the chest pain never returned. How can a procedure so contraindicated by research be so common? Now, listen to the story with the sad ending: Not long after helping the executive, Brown and his colleagues were asked to consult on the case of a 51-year-old man from a tiny Missouri town. This man had successfully recovered from Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but radiation and six cycles of chemotherapy had left him with progressive scarring creeping over his lungs. He was suffocating inside his own body. The man was transferred to Barnes Jewish Hospital, where Brown works, for a life-saving lung transplant. But when the man arrived in St. Louis, the lung-transplant team could not operate on him.\n\nFour months earlier, the man had been admitted to another hospital because he was having trouble breathing. There, despite the man\u2019s history of lymphoma treatment, which can cause scarring, a cardiologist wondered whether the shortness of breath might be due to a blocked artery. As with the executive, the cardiologist recommended a catheter. Unlike the executive, however, this man, like most patients, agreed to the procedure. It revealed a partial blockage of one coronary artery. So, doctors implanted a stent, even though there was no clear evidence that the blockage was responsible for the man\u2019s shortness of breath\u2014which was, in fact, caused by the lung scarring. Finally, the man was put on standard post-implantation medications to make sure he would not develop a blood clot at the site of the stent. But those medications made surgery potentially lethal, putting the man at an extremely high risk of bleeding to death during the transplant. The operation had to be delayed. Meanwhile, the man\u2019s lung tissue continued to harden and scar, like molten lava that cools and hardens into gray stone. Until one day, he couldn\u2019t suck in another breath. The man had survived advanced-stage lymphoma only to die in the hospital, waiting until he could go off needed medication for an unneeded stent. What the patients in both stories had in common was that neither needed a stent. By dint of an inquiring mind and a smartphone, one escaped with his life intact. The greater concern is: How can a procedure so contraindicated by research be so common?\n\nWhen you visit a doctor, you probably assume the treatment you receive is backed by evidence from medical research. Surely, the drug you\u2019re prescribed or the surgery you\u2019ll undergo wouldn\u2019t be so common if it didn\u2019t work, right? For all the truly wondrous developments of modern medicine\u2014imaging technologies that enable precision surgery, routine organ transplants, care that transforms premature infants into perfectly healthy kids, and remarkable chemotherapy treatments, to name a few\u2014it is distressingly ordinary for patients to get treatments that research has shown are ineffective or even dangerous. Sometimes doctors simply haven\u2019t kept up with the science. Other times doctors know the state of play perfectly well but continue to deliver these treatments because it\u2019s profitable\u2014or even because they\u2019re popular and patients demand them. Some procedures are implemented based on studies that did not prove whether they really worked in the first place. Others were initially supported by evidence but then were contradicted by better evidence, and yet these procedures have remained the standards of care for years, or decades. Even if a drug you take was studied in thousands of people and shown truly to save lives, chances are it won\u2019t do that for you. The good news is, it probably won\u2019t harm you, either. Some of the most widely prescribed medications do little of anything meaningful, good or bad, for most people who take them.\n\nIn a 2013 study, a dozen doctors from around the country examined all 363 articles published in The New England Journal of Medicine over a decade\u20142001 through 2010\u2014that tested a current clinical practice, from the use of antibiotics to treat people with persistent Lyme disease symptoms (didn\u2019t help) to the use of specialized sponges for preventing infections in patients having colorectal surgery (caused more infections). Their results, published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, found 146 studies that proved or strongly suggested that a current standard practice either had no benefit at all or was inferior to the practice it replaced; 138 articles supported the efficacy of an existing practice, and the remaining 79 were deemed inconclusive. (There was, naturally, plenty of disagreement with the authors\u2019 conclusions.) Some of the contradicted practices possibly affect millions of people daily: Intensive medication to keep blood pressure very low in diabetic patients caused more side effects and was no better at preventing heart attacks or death than more mild treatments that allowed for a somewhat higher blood pressure. Other practices challenged by the study are less common\u2014like the use of a genetic test to determine if a popular blood thinner is right for a particular patient\u2014but gaining in popularity despite mounting contrary evidence. Some examples defy intuition: CPR is no more effective with rescue breathing than if chest compressions are used alone; and breast-cancer survivors who are told not to lift weights with swollen limbs actually should lift weights, because it improves their symptoms.\n\nA separate but similarly themed study in 2012 funded by the Australian Department of Health and Ageing, which sought to reduce spending on needless procedures, looked across the same decade and identified 156 active medical practices that are probably unsafe or ineffective. The list goes on: A brand new review of 48 separate studies\u2014comprising more than 13,000 clinicians\u2014looked at how doctors perceive disease-screening tests and found that they tend to underestimate the potential harms of screening and overestimate the potential benefits; an editorial in American Family Physician, co-written by one of the journal\u2019s editors, noted that a \u201cstriking feature\u201d of recent research is how much of it contradicts traditional medical opinion. That isn\u2019t likely to change any time soon. The 21st Century Cures Act\u2014a rare bipartisan bill, pushed by more than 1,400 lobbyists and signed into law in December\u2014lowers evidentiary standards for new uses of drugs and for marketing and approval of some medical devices. Furthermore, last month President Donald Trump scolded the FDA for what he characterized as withholding drugs from dying patients. He promised to slash regulations \u201cbig league. \u2026 It could even be up to 80 percent\u201d of current FDA regulations, he said. To that end, one of the president\u2019s top candidates to head the FDA, tech investor Jim O\u2019Neill, has openly advocated for drugs to be approved before they\u2019re shown to work. \u201cLet people start using them at their own risk,\u201d O\u2019Neill has argued.\n\nSo, while Americans can expect to see more drugs and devices sped to those who need them, they should also expect the problem of therapies based on flimsy evidence to accelerate. In a recent Stat op-ed, two Johns Hopkins University physician-researchers wrote that the new 21st Century Cures Act will turn the label \u201cFDA approved\u201d into \u201ca shadow of its former self.\u201d In 1962, Congress famously raised the evidentiary bar for drug approvals after thousands of babies were born with malformed limbs to mothers who had taken the sleep aid thalidomide. Steven Galson, a retired rear admiral and former acting surgeon general under both President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, has called the strengthened approval process created in 1962 the FDA\u2019s \u201cbiggest contribution to health.\u201d Before that, he said, \u201cmany marketed drugs were ineffective for their labeled uses.\u201d Striking the right balance between innovation and regulation is incredibly difficult, but once remedies are in use\u2014even in the face of contrary evidence\u2014they tend to persist. A 2007 Journal of the American Medical Association paper coauthored by John Ioannidis\u2014a Stanford University medical researcher and statistician who rose to prominence exposing poor-quality medical science\u2014found that it took 10 years for large swaths of the medical community to stop referencing popular practices after their efficacy was unequivocally vanquished by science.\n\nAccording to Vinay Prasad, an oncologist and one of the authors of the Mayo Clinic Proceedings paper, medicine is quick to adopt practices based on shaky evidence but slow to drop them once they\u2019ve been blown up by solid proof. As a young doctor, Prasad had an experience that left him determined to banish ineffective procedures. He was the medical resident on a team caring for a middle-aged woman with stable chest pain. She underwent a stent procedure and suffered a stroke, resulting in brain damage. Prasad, now at the Oregon Health and Sciences University, still winces slightly when he talks about it. University of Chicago professor and physician Adam Cifu had a similar experience. Cifu had spent several years convincing newly postmenopausal patients to go on hormone therapy for heart health\u2014a treatment that at the millennium accounted for 90 million annual prescriptions\u2014only to then see a well-designed trial show no heart benefit and perhaps even a risk of harm. \u201cI had to basically run back all those decisions with women,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, boy, that really sticks with you, when you have patients saying, \u2018But I thought you said this was the right thing.\u2019\u201d So he and Prasad coauthored a 2015 book, Ending Medical Reversal, a call to raise the evidence bar for adopting new medical standards. \u201cWe have a culture where we reward discovery; we don\u2019t reward replication,\u201d Prasad says, referring to the process of retesting initial scientific findings to make sure they\u2019re valid.\n\nSteven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, says the situation with stents, at least, is improving. As a previous president of the American College of Cardiology, he helped create guidelines for determining when a stable patient might be a reasonable candidate for a stent. (Both Nissen and David Holmes, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and also a former ACC president, said that in cases in which patients have had bad responses to medication and persistent, life-altering chest pain, even a short-term reduction of symptoms may justify a stent.) Thanks to such guidelines, the frequency of clearly inappropriate stent placement declined significantly between 2010 and 2014. Still, the latest assessment in more than 1,600 hospitals across the country concluded that about half of all stent placements in stable patients were either definitely or possibly inappropriate. \u201cThings have gotten better,\u201d Nissen says, \u201cbut they\u2019re not where they need to be.\u201d Nissen thinks removing financial incentives can also help change behavior. \u201cI have a dozen or so cardiologists, and they get the exact same salary whether they put in a stent or don\u2019t,\u201d Nissen says, \u201cand I think that\u2019s made a difference and kept our rates of unnecessary procedures low.\u201d Two years ago, a trio of Bloomberg journalists reported that Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City was scheduling \u201cemergencies-by-appointment\u201d for patients to get stents, because, the report said, insurance is more likely to cover the procedure in an emergency situation. (For a patient who is having a heart attack, a stent can be life-saving.) Mount Sinai\u2019s catheter lab features annual reports that boast of how many stents are implanted, alongside patient testimonials, like one from 77-year-old Nelly Rodriguez, who notes that her doctor \u201creassures me that as long as I follow his instructions, eat healthy, and remain smoke-free, the stents he has put into my arteries over the years should last and I will feel well.\u201d In most cases, every word of that sentence between \u201csmoke-free\u201d and \u201cI will feel well\u201d could be deleted and it would be just as true. Atenolol did not reduce heart attacks or deaths\u2014patients on atenolol just had better blood-pressure numbers when they died. It is, of course, hard to get people in any profession to do the right thing when they\u2019re paid to do the wrong thing. But there\u2019s more to this than market perversion. On a recent snowy St. Louis morning, Brown gave a grand-rounds lecture to about 80 doctors at Barnes Jewish Hospital. Early in the talk, he showed results from medical tests on the executive he treated, the one who avoided a stent. He then presented data from thousands of patients in randomized controlled trials of stents versus noninvasive treatments, and it showed that stents yielded no benefit for stable patients. He asked the doctors in the room to raise their hands if they would still send a patient with the same diagnostic findings as the executive for a catheterization, which would almost surely lead to a stent. At least half of the hands in the room went up, some of them sheepishly. Brown expressed surprise at the honesty in the room. \u201cWell,\u201d one of the attendees told him, \u201cwe know what we do.\u201d But why?\n\nIn 2007, after a seminal study, the COURAGE trial, showed that stents did not prevent heart attacks or death in stable patients, a trio of doctors at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted 90-minute focus groups with cardiologists to answer that question. They presented the cardiologists with fictional scenarios of patients who had at least one narrowed artery but no symptoms and asked them if they would recommend a stent. Almost to a person, the cardiologists, including those whose incomes were not tied to tests and procedures, gave the same answers: They said that they were aware of the data but would still send the patient for a stent. The rationalizations in each focus group followed four themes: (1) Cardiologists recalled stories of people dying suddenly\u2014including the highly publicized case of jogging guru Jim Fixx\u2014and feared they would regret it if a patient did not get a stent and then dropped dead. The study authors concluded that cardiologists were being influenced by the \u201cavailability heuristic,\u201d a term coined by Nobel laureate psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman for the human instinct to base an important decision on an easily recalled, dramatic example, even if that example is irrelevant or incredibly rare. (2) Cardiologists believed that a stent would relieve patient anxiety. (3) Cardiologists felt they could better defend themselves in a lawsuit if a patient did get a stent and then died, rather than if they didn\u2019t get a stent and died. \u201cIn California,\u201d one said, \u201cif this person had an event within two years, the doctor who didn\u2019t [intervene] would be successfully sued.\u201d And there was one more powerful and ubiquitous reason: (4) Despite the data, cardiologists couldn\u2019t believe that stents did not help: Stenting just made so much sense. A patient has chest pain, a doctor sees a blockage, how can opening the blockage not make a difference?\n\nIn the late 1980s, with evidence already mounting that forcing open blood vessels was less effective and more dangerous than noninvasive treatments, cardiologist Eric Topol coined the term, \u201coculostenotic reflex.\u201d Oculo, from the Latin for \u201ceye,\u201d and stenotic, from the Greek for \u201cnarrow,\u201d as in a narrowed artery. The meaning: If you see a blockage, you\u2019ll reflexively fix a blockage. Topol described \u201cwhat appears to be an irresistible temptation among some invasive cardiologists\u201d to place a stent any time they see a narrowed artery, evidence from thousands of patients in randomized trials be damned. Stenting is what scientists call \u201cbio-plausible\u201d\u2014intuition suggests it should work. It\u2019s just that the human body is a little more Book of Job and a little less household plumbing: Humans didn\u2019t invent it, it\u2019s really complicated, and people often have remarkably little insight into cause and effect.\n\nChances are, you or someone in your family has taken medication or undergone a procedure that is bio-plausible but does not work. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in three American adults have high blood pressure. Blood pressure is a measure of how hard your blood is pushing on the sides of vessels as it moves through your body; the harder the pushing, the more strain on your heart. People with high blood pressure are at enormously increased risk for heart disease (the nation\u2019s No. 1 killer) and stroke (No. 3).\n\nSo it\u2019s not hard to understand why Sir James Black won a Nobel Prize largely for his 1960s discovery of beta-blockers, which slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure. The Nobel committee lauded the discovery as the \u201cgreatest breakthrough when it comes to pharmaceuticals against heart illness since the discovery of digitalis 200 years ago.\u201d In 1981, the FDA approved one of the first beta-blockers, atenolol, after it was shown to dramatically lower blood pressure. Atenolol became such a standard treatment that it was used as a reference drug for comparison with other blood-pressure drugs. In 1997, a Swedish hospital began a trial of more than 9,000 patients with high blood pressure who were randomly assigned to take either atenolol or a competitor drug that was designed to lower blood pressure for at least four years. The competitor-drug group had fewer deaths (204) than the atenolol group (234) and fewer strokes (232 compared with 309). But the study also found that both drugs lowered blood pressure by the exact same amount, so why wasn\u2019t the vaunted atenolol saving more people? That odd result prompted a subsequent study, which compared atenolol with sugar pills. It found that atenolol didn\u2019t prevent heart attacks or extend life at all; it just lowered blood pressure. A 2004 analysis of clinical trials\u2014including eight randomized controlled trials comprising more than 24,000 patients\u2014concluded that atenolol did not reduce heart attacks or deaths compared with using no treatment whatsoever; patients on atenolol just had better blood-pressure numbers when they died.\n\n\u201cYes, we can move a number, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to better outcomes,\u201d says John Mandrola, a cardiac electrophysiologist in Louisville who advocates for healthy lifestyle changes. It\u2019s tough, he says, \u201cwhen patients take a pill, see their numbers improve, and think their health is improved.\u201d The overall picture of beta-blockers is complex. For example, some beta-blockers have been shown clearly to reduce the chance of a stroke or heart attack in patients with heart failure. But the latest review of beta-blockers from the Cochrane Collaboration\u2014an independent, international group of researchers that attempts to synthesize the best available research\u2014reported that they \u201care not recommended as first line treatment for hypertension as compared to placebo due to their modest effect on stroke and no significant reduction in mortality or coronary heart disease.\u201d Researchers writing in Lancet questioned the use of atenolol as a comparison standard for other drugs and added that \u201cstroke was also more frequent with atenolol treatment\u201d compared with other therapies. Still, according to a 2012 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, more than 33.8 million prescriptions of atenolol were written at a retail cost of more than $260 million. There is some evidence that atenolol might reduce the risk of stroke in young patients, but there is also evidence that it increases the risk of stroke in older patients\u2014and it is older patients who are getting it en masse. According to ProPublica\u2019s Medicare prescription database, in 2014, atenolol was prescribed to more than 2.6 million Medicare beneficiaries, ranking it the 31st most prescribed drug out of 3,362 drugs. One doctor, Chinh Huynh, a family practitioner in Westminster, California, wrote more than 1,100 atenolol prescriptions in 2014 for patients over 65, making him one of the most prolific prescribers in the country. Reached at his office, Huynh said atenolol is \u201cvery common for hypertension; it\u2019s not just me.\u201d When asked why he continues to prescribe atenolol so frequently in light of the randomized, controlled trials that showed its ineffectiveness, Huynh said, \u201cI read a lot of medical magazines, but I didn\u2019t see that.\u201d Huynh added that his \u201cpatients are doing fine with it\u201d and asked that any relevant journal articles be faxed to him.\n\nBrown, the Washington University cardiologist, says that once doctors get out of training, \u201cit\u2019s a job, and they\u2019re trying to earn money, and they don\u2019t necessarily keep up. So really major changes have to be generational.\u201d Data compiled by QuintilesIMS, which provides information and technology services to the health-care industry, show that atenolol prescriptions consistently fell by 3 million per year over a recent five-year period. If that rate holds, atenolol will stop being prescribed in just under two decades since high-quality trials showed that it simply does not work. Just as the cardiovascular system is not a kitchen sink, the musculoskeletal system is not an erector set. Cause and effect is frequently elusive. Consider the knee, that most bedeviling of joints. A procedure known as arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, or APM, accounts for roughly a half-million procedures per year at a cost of around $4 billion. A meniscus is a crescent-shaped piece of fibrous cartilage that helps stabilize and provide cushioning for the knee joint. As people age, they often suffer tears in the meniscus that are not from any acute injury. APM is meant to relieve knee pain by cleaning out damaged pieces of a meniscus and shaving the cartilage back to crescent form. This is not a fringe surgery; in recent years, it has been one of the most popular surgical procedures in the hemisphere. And a burgeoning body of evidence says that it does not work for the most common varieties of knee pain.\n\nSomething like the knee version of the oculostenotic reflex takes hold: A patient comes in with knee pain, and an MRI shows a torn meniscus; naturally, the patient wants it fixed, and the surgeon wants to fix it and send the patient for physical therapy. And patients do get better, just not necessarily from the surgery. A 2013 study of patients over 45 conducted in seven hospitals in the United States found that APM followed by physical therapy produced the same results as physical therapy alone for most patients. Another study at two public hospitals and two physical-therapy clinics found the same result two years after treatment. A unique study at five orthopedic clinics in Finland compared APM with \u201csham surgery.\u201d That is, surgeons took patients with knee pain to operating rooms, made incisions, faked surgeries, and then sewed them back up. Neither the patients nor the doctors evaluating them knew who had received real surgeries and who was sporting a souvenir scar. A year later, there was nothing to tell them apart. The sham surgery performed just as well as real surgery. Except that, in the long run, the real surgery may increase the risk of knee osteoarthritis. Also, it\u2019s expensive, and, while APM is exceedingly safe, surgery plus physical therapy has a greater risk of side effects than just physical therapy. \u201cJust do the surgery. None of us are going to be upset with you for doing the surgery. Your bank account\u2019s not going to be upset with you for doing the surgery.\u201d At least one-third of adults over 50 will show meniscal tears if they get an MRI. But two-thirds of those will have no symptoms whatsoever. (For those who do have pain, it may be from osteoarthritis, not the meniscus tear.) They would never know they had a tear if not for medical imaging, but once they have the imaging, they may well end up having surgery that doesn\u2019t work for a problem they don\u2019t have.\n\nFor obvious reasons, placebo-controlled trials of surgeries are difficult to execute. The most important question then is: Why, when the highest level of evidence available contradicts a common practice, does little change? For one, the results of these studies do not prove that the surgery is useless, but rather that it is performed on a huge number of people who are unlikely to get any benefit. Meniscal tears are as diverse as the human beings they belong to, and even large studies will never capture all the variation that surgeons see; there are compelling real-world results that show the surgery helps certain patients. \u201cI think it\u2019s an extremely helpful intervention in cases where a patient does not suffer from the constant ache of arthritis, but has sharp, intermittent pain and a blockage of motion,\u201d says John Christoforetti, a prominent orthopedic surgeon in Pittsburgh. \u201cBut when you\u2019re talking about the average inactive American, who suffers gradual onset knee pain and has full motion, many of them have a meniscal tear on MRI and they should not have surgery as initial treatment.\u201d Still, the surgery\u2014like some others meant for narrower uses\u2014is common even for patients who don\u2019t need it. And patients themselves are part of the problem. According to interviews with surgeons, many patients they see want, or even demand, to be operated upon and will simply shop around until they find a willing doctor. Christoforetti recalls one patient who traveled a long way to see him but was \u201cabsolutely not a candidate for an operation.\u201d Despite the financial incentive to operate, he explained to the patient and her husband that the surgery would not help. \u201cShe left with a smile on her face,\u201d Christoforetti says, \u201cbut literally as they\u2019re checking out, we got a ding that someone had rated us [on a website], and it\u2019s her husband. He\u2019s been typing on his phone during the visit, and it\u2019s a one-star rating that I\u2019m this insensitive guy he wouldn\u2019t let operate on his dog. They\u2019d been online, and they firmly believed she needed this one operation and I was the guy to do it.\u201d\n\nSo, what do surgeons do? \u201cMost of my colleagues,\u201d Christoforetti says, \u201cwill say: \u2018Look, save yourself the headache, just do the surgery. None of us are going to be upset with you for doing the surgery. Your bank account\u2019s not going to be upset with you for doing the surgery. Just do the surgery.\u2019\u201d Randomized, placebo-controlled trials are the gold standard of medical evidence. But not all RCTs, as they are known, are created equal. Even within the gold standard, well-intentioned practices can muddle a study. That is particularly true with \u201ccrossover\u201d trials, which have become popular for cancer-drug investigations. In cancer research, a crossover trial often means that patients in the control group, who start on a placebo, are actually given the experimental drug during the study if their disease progresses. Thus, they are no longer a true control group. The benefit of a crossover trial is that it allows more people with severe disease to try an experimental drug; the disadvantage is the possibility that the study is altered in a manner that obscures the efficacy of the drug being tested. In 2010, on the strength of a crossover trial, Provenge became the first cancer vaccine approved by the FDA. A cancer vaccine is a form of immunotherapy, in which a patient\u2019s own immune system is spurred by a drug to attack cancer cells. Given the extraordinary difficulty of treating metastatic cancer, and high expectations following the abject failure of other cancer vaccines, the approval of Provenge was greeted with ecstatic enthusiasm. One scientific paper heralded it as \u201cthe gateway to an exciting new paradigm.\u201d Except, Provenge did not hinder tumor growth at all, and it\u2019s hard to know if it really works.\n\nProvenge was approved based on the \u201cIMPACT study,\u201d a randomized, placebo-controlled trial initially meant to see whether Provenge could stop prostate cancer from progressing. It didn\u2019t. Three-and-a-half months into the study, the cancers of patients who had received Provenge and those who had received a placebo had advanced similarly. Nonetheless, patients who received Provenge ultimately had a median survival time of about four months longer than those who received the placebo. Due to the way in which the IMPACT trial unfolded, however, it\u2019s hard to tell if Provenge was truly responsible for the life extension. Because Provenge did not halt tumor growth, many of the patients who began the study on it also started to receive docetaxel, a chemotherapy drug that is well established to treat advanced prostate cancer. The cancers of the patients on a placebo were also progressing, so they were \u201ccrossed over\u201d and given Provenge after a delay. Their cancer continued progressing, and after another delay, many of them also got docetaxel. In the end, fewer patients in the group that started on a placebo received docetaxel, and, when they did, they got it later in the study. So Provenge may have worked, but it\u2019s impossible to tell for sure: Was the slightly longer survival of one group because they got Provenge earlier or because the other group got docetaxel later? \u201cIf the treatment were Pixy Stix, you\u2019d have a similar effect. One group gets Pixy Stix, and when their cancer progresses, they get a real treatment.\u201d The year after Provenge was approved, the federal government\u2019s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality issued a \u201ctechnology assessment\u201d report examining all of the evidence regarding Provenge efficacy. The report says there is \u201cmoderate\u201d evidence that Provenge effectively treats cancer, but it also highlighted the fact that more patients who got Provenge at the beginning of the seminal trial also received more and earlier chemotherapy. The report concludes that the effect of Provenge is apparent \u201conly in the context of a substantial amount of eventual chemotherapeutic treatment.\u201d In other words, it is unclear which effects in the trial were due to Provenge and which were due to chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cThe people who went on docetaxel went on it because their disease was progressing, so you\u2019ve already broken the randomization,\u201d says Elise Berliner, director of AHRQ\u2019s Technology Assessment Program. Prasad, the oncologist who advocates for higher standards of preapproval evidence, is less diplomatic: \u201cIf the treatment were Pixy Stix, you\u2019d have a similar effect. One group gets Pixy Stix, and when their cancer progresses, they get a real treatment.\u201d The larger issue has nothing to do with Provenge specifically but about the way it gained FDA approval. Therapies are frequently approved for use based on clinical trials that can\u2019t actually prove whether they work. \u201cClinical trials almost all have issues like this one,\u201d Berliner says, \u201cand it\u2019s very hard to do randomized controlled trials after drugs are approved.\u201d According to a new paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology,even when cancer drugs clearly do work in trials, they often don\u2019t work or work substantially less well in the real world, perhaps because subjects in trials are not representative of typical patients. Berliner is hoping to expand and improve registries that track large numbers of real-world patients as an additional source of information. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for 15 years producing these reports,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019m getting frustrated.\u201d Ideally, findings that suggest a therapy works and those that suggest it does not would receive attention commensurate with their scientific rigor, even in the earliest stages of exploration. But academic journals, scientists, and the media all tend to prefer research that concludes that some exciting new treatment does indeed work.", "description": "Long after research contradicts common medical practices, patients continue to demand them and physicians continue to deliver.
