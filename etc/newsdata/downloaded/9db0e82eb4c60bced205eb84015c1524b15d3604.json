A 2017 Pew Poll found that 71% of American adults said it\u2019s \u201cvery important for a man to be able to support a family financially to be a good husband or partner.\u201d Dishes aren\u2019t enough.\n\nBut women who don\u2019t see a man as marriage material because of his income are seeing it wrong. Marriage is a stabilizing force, and married men are the highest-earning group of adults \u2014 more than single men, more than anyone.\n\nWith good reason. A married man has something to work for in a way one who\u2019s single does not. Add children to the mix, and guys will find hungry mouths to feed to be a big motivator to earn.\n\nOf course, a man\u2019s potential is harder to see than the number of commas on his bank-account statement. But smart women should be looking for that, rather than the cash in hand.", "description": "", "authors": ["Karol Markowicz", "Nypost.Com Dont-Ditch-A-Potential-Husband-Over-His-Income"], "top_image": ""}
