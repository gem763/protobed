According to two people familiar with the discussion , Trump promised to remain quiet on ongoing anti-government unrest in Hong Kong if trade talks progressed ( they haven't, and he hasn't ).\n\nWhether China actually sticks to its principles of non-interference is highly debatable. But the idea that Beijing would ever agree openly to a tit-for-tat deal on something like the Biden investigation represents a major misunderstanding of how Chinese politics works, and perhaps provides a clue why Trump has failed to make any breakthroughs in other areas with Beijing.\n\nJUST WATCHED Was Trump request of Ukraine quid pro quo?

Beijing was a strong critic of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, though it initially supported action against Saddam Hussein in the 1990s following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.\n\nIn 2007, Beijing joined with Moscow in vetoing any criticism of Myanmar on its human rights record; the following year both also vetoed sanctions against Zimbabwe , as they have multiple times with regard to Syria . China has also been the strongest check at the UN on any action against North Korea's nuclear ambitions, restraining what the international community can do and when.\n\nThis has remained consistent even as Beijing has increased its own role in peacekeeping efforts overseas, expanded its military footprint to Africa and throughout Asia, and lobbied country after country to drop support for Taiwan in favor of China\n\n\"China appears to have struck a most convenient -- and shrewd -- balance of selective legitimate foreign intervention and soft power efforts, while at the same time maintaining the capacity to both veto Security Council resolutions as it sees fit and shake off any reproach of its domestic policies and strategies,\" according to Sherif A. Elgebeily, director of the London-based Center for the Study of International Peace and Security.\n\nJUST WATCHED How should the media cover the Hunter Biden story? Replay More Videos ...

From Beijing's perspective, whatever other countries think about its actions in Xinjiang, Tibet or Hong Kong, their responsibility or ability to do anything about them stops at China's borders.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations last month, Foreign Minister Wang Yi spelled this out , saying \"if the China-US relationship is to remain stable, it is most important that we respect each other's territorial sovereignty, social system and development path, and try not to impose one's will or model on the other.\"\n\n\"China will never interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, and we trust that the American people are capable of sorting out their own problems,\" Wang said. \"Likewise, we expect the US to treat China in the same spirit and not interfere in China's internal affairs.\"\n\nThat's why it is so bizarre -- and such a potential tactical misstep -- for Trump to ask China, both in private and now openly, to investigate one of his potential electoral rivals.\n\nBeijing may not stick to its principles in practice, and indeed there is plenty of evidence that China runs the type of influence campaigns and behind-the-scenes diplomacy that both Moscow and Washington are adept at, but it is never going to acknowledge this publicly or agree to a tit-for-tat deal.\n\nDoing so would open the door to foreign interference in China's own affairs, one that Beijing has spent decades trying to jam shut as hard as possible.", "description": "Trump wanted China's help to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
