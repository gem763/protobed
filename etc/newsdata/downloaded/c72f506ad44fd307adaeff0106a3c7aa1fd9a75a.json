With three new judges at the helm of the show, it\u2019s hard to say what form the show will take in 2020. But thanks to scores of TikTok users, we\u2019ve got a fair idea of how the dreaded opening title sequence might play out.\n\nMasterChef\u2018s incredibly strange and often baffling opening title sequence has been put through the TikTok ringer as the latest Australian meme to begin flooding the For You page.\n\nThe meme itself is fairly straightforward, largely because the original source material itself was already ridiculous: A montage of people doing something no one in their right mind would ever do in a normal kitchen, before smiling at the camera while their name hits the screen.\n\nThe Tok (cool name, everyone\u2019s using it) is currently flooded with various variations of the gag, which involves people doing things like slicing a raw egg, racking up lines of tomato sauce, and placing a CD player in a microwave, before they pause to smile at the camera.\n\nIt\u2019s all incredibly wholesome, and very, very funny.\n\nHonestly, give the MasterChef contestants next year a bread-milk challenge. Lean into it as far as you can. Make them butter carrots. Have those kitchen dorks line up single file and grind a pepper mill directly into their mouths.\n\nNow that\u2019s a version of MasterChef I\u2019d be keen to see.", "description": "TikTok is currently flooded with Australians turning the bafflingly silly MasterChef opening titles into memes of increasing hilarity.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/masterchef-tiktokfb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
