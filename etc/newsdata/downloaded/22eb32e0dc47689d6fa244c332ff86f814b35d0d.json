(She won a bronze medal as part of the women\u2019s sabre team.) Her new book, The Proudest Blue: A Story of Hijab and Family depicts an African-American Muslim girl wearing a hijab and confronting the challenges and celebrating the joys that brings.\n\nMuhammad recalled that as a kid growing up in New Jersey before 9/11, she was taunted for wearing a hijab, with one kid calling her head covering a \u201ctablecloth,\u201d and said she hopes her book can help kids \u201cfeel strong in the face of being made to feel different.\u201d\n\nShe added something that I know resonates with countless Muslim Americans today, \u201cI believe it\u2019s a lot harder in this moment to be Muslim\u2026than it was right after 9/11.\u201d", "description": "Despite the dreams of Trump and people like him, we as a community aren\u2019t going anywhere.", "authors": ["Dean Obeidallah"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568162949/190911-deano-ibtihaj-muhammad-hero_t5yvxa", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
