The latest poll from Scott Rasmussen dips a toe into questions related to this subject, specifically how voters feel about both legal and illegal immigration, assimilation and the whole concept of America as a \u201cmelting pot.\u201d It\u2019s an old concept, embedded in America\u2019s cultural identity, but these numbers indicate that there\u2019s been a gradual shift going on. For one thing, the public definitely appears conflicted over whether or not this country is \u201copen to allowing immigrant culture to help shape and influence American culture.\u201d\n\nJust 35% of voters believe that most Americans today are open to allowing immigrant culture help shape and influence American culture. A ScottRasmussen.com national survey found that 37% don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true and 27% are not sure. If true, that would reflect a significant change from American history. Date released earlier showed that 64% believe our nation has a unique culture created and shaped by blending many varied and separate cultures over the years. Republicans, by a 43% to 28% margin believe most Americans are still open to that concept. Democrats are evenly divided\u201335% believe most Americans welcome cultural influences from immigrants while 38% do not. Among Independent voters, however, just 28% believe those influences are welcomed by most Americans. Forty-six percent (46%) disagree.\n\nGiven how the two parties are generally portrayed in the news media, it\u2019s rather counterintuitive to see that a larger percentage of Republicans believe \u201cmost Americans\u201d are open to the concept of allowing immigrants to help shape and influence American society than Democrats. But then, this is one of those survey questions (the kind I believe produces better results) where they ask the respondent what they think \u201cmost people\u201d feel.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed this here before, but if you ask someone if they personally are open to a particular thing they\u2019ll most often give you the answer that they think \u201csounds right.\u201d For example, if you\u2019re looking for data on antisemitism and you ask someone if they are okay with a Jewish person becoming president, moving in next door or what have you, they\u2019ll almost certainly say yes even if they don\u2019t really mean it. But when you ask them if \u201cmost of their neighbors\u201d are good with that idea, they\u2019ll often say no. In other words, of course, I\u2019m not antisemitic, but a lot of these other people around here\u2026\n\nDelving into the crosstabs, we find some other interesting contradictions along the same lines. For example, one question was a choice between describing America as \u201ca white culture derived from our English heritage\u201d or, alternatively, \u201ca unique culture that has been created and shaped by blending many varied and separate cultures.\u201d By a more than three-to-one margin (64/21) people said America was a unique blend of varied cultures.\n\nBut when asked whether it was more important for incoming immigrants to \u201cassimilate and become part of American culture or to retain their own unique cultural heritage\u201d the numbers almost completely flipped. 61% thought it was more important to assimilate while only 39% said it was more important to retain their cultural heritage.\n\nWhen asked if it was still accurate to describe America as a \u201cmelting pot,\u201d a whopping 78% felt that it was either very or at least somewhat accurate. But at the same time, less than half agreed with the statement that \u201cmost immigrants desire to become part of the broader American culture.\u201d\n\nThis is a particularly fascinating survey that takes a deep dive into American feelings about immigration and culture. If you browse through all the crosstabs you might be surprised by what you find.", "description": "American dreaming", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/USCISoffice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
