Purchases of big-ticket items usually wane when the economy slows or Americans become worried about their jobs.\n\nSales rose almost as much for Internet retailers and home and garden centers such as Home HD, -0.13% and Lowe\u2019s LOW, -0.32% .\n\nInternet stores evidently suffered little letdown after a burst of sales in July when Amazon held its annual Prime Day and rivals tried to keep pace with their own deals.\n\nSales at gas stations fell almost 1% in August as the summer driving season came to a close, but that\u2019s a good thing for consumers. The less they have to spend on gas, the more they can save or spend on other goods and services.\n\nOther retailers did not fare as well. Restaurants, department stores and clothing retailers also posted sales declines of around 1%. And sales dipped at groceries and home-furnishing stores.\n\nRead: Inflation\u2019s slow burn coming to an end? CPI shows prices on the rise\n\nBig picture: The economy has slowed in 2019 partly because of the trade war with China and its depressing effects on the rest of the world. Consumers are the ones keeping the good times going, buoyed by rising incomes and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years.\n\nSpending soared in the spring and it was fairly strong overall in the first two months of the third quarter. The economy is still growing around 2% and there\u2019s little sign of imminent recession \u2014 assuming the trade war doesn\u2019t get any worse.\n\nRead: U.S. consumers are far from spent and that\u2019s a lifesaver for a wobbly economy\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201cAfter an exceptionally strong reading in July, sales growth slowed markedly in the past month, but still came in at a solid clip that is consistent with moderate economic growth,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.\n\n\u201cThe slowdown in retail sales for August was expected after the stronger gains in July,\u201d said Nationwide Chief Economist David Berson.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.23% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.00% were mixed in Friday trades. Stocks have been rising in anticipation of the Fed cutting interest rates. Talk of a potential truce of sorts in the U.S.-China trade war has also helped.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +5.97% rose to 1.83%, extending a recent upturn.", "description": "U.S. retail sales got a big boost in August from purchases of new autos and building supplies, but most other stores reported weak or declining receipts in a...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP694_retail_ZG_20190819094757.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
