Been informed local branch #Stanmore won\u2019t b selling fireworks this year due 2 the distress it causes our pets & wildlife.\n\n\u2018Any other stores doing this? Can\u2019t thank you enough as my dog is beside herself with fear at these times.\u2019\n\nThey responded saying: \u2018Hey Sally, thanks! We won\u2019t be selling fireworks in any of our stores this year. Hope this helps!\u2019\n\nThe loud bangs and bright flashes can cause distress for animals and the elderly, charities say (Picture: Getty)\n\nThere have been calls for outright bans on fireworks because the noise and flashes they make can be distressing for animals and the elderly. They have also been linked with anti-social behaviour.\n\nMan killed girlfriend, phoned his mum and said 'she's done my head in'\n\nThe law states that fireworks must not be set off between 11pm and 7am, except on special occasions such as Bonfire Night and New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSally also called on Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and Waitrose to follow suit.\n\nShe said: \u2018Sainsburys aren\u2019t selling fireworks in any stores this year as it causes so much stress in pets, wildlife & kids. Please think about doing the same. #Diwali2019 doesn\u2019t have 2b celebrate with fireworks, it\u2019s a festival of light!\u2019\n\nSainsbury\u2019s is believed to be the first major retailer to carry a year-round ban on the explosives.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s has been praised for saying none of the 2,3000 stores will stock them (Picture: Getty)\n\nA spokesman for the Dogs Trust said: \u2018We congratulate Sainsbury\u2019s on their decision not to sell fireworks this year and would encourage others to do the same.\n\nHalloween costumes contain the same amount of plastic as 83,000,000 bottles\n\n\u2018Although they can look beautiful, fireworks can be very distressing for dogs when let off unexpectedly, and because they are so easily accessible all year-round, dog owners are on tenterhooks as to when their beloved pooch will next be frightened.\n\n\u2018A survey found over half of the British public think fireworks should be limited to public displays only.\n\n\u2018To reduce the distress caused to dogs we would like their use restricted to licensed public displays at certain times of the year or organised events, which are well publicised. This will enable owners to take steps to prepare their dogs ahead of any fireworks events. Good for the dogs and good for firework fans.\u2019\n\nA Sainsbury\u2019s spokesperson said: \u2018Fireworks are no longer available in our stores but customers can continue to choose from a range of seasonal products, such as glow sticks and light up spinning wands.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
