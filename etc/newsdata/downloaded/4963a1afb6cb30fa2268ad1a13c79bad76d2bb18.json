The push, fueled with bipartisan support, comes after 53 children died in hot cars last year, marking a record, according to noheatstroke.org. So far this year, 38 children have died from vehicular heatstroke.\n\nThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers\u2014trade groups that represent the bulk of domestic- and international-made cars and trucks in the U.S. market\u2014on Wednesday said they will add rear-seat reminder systems on new cars by model year 2025 or sooner. These alerts will at a minimum include auditory and visual cues to drivers that remind them to check the back seat before leaving the car, the groups say.\n\nChild-safety advocates have pushed for years for a technological solution to stop hot-car deaths. However, many consider motion-detection technology crucial to such back-seat alert systems\u2014a technology that Wednesday\u2019s agreement doesn\u2019t stipulate.\n\nAmong systems covered by the auto makers\u2019 agreement are door-sequencing technology. When a rear door is opened at the beginning of a trip, it tracks if it is opened again at its conclusion, sounding an alert if not.\n\nSafety advocates say that solution isn\u2019t adequate because the system can reset itself when the car is turned off, for instance if a driver stops for gas. It also wouldn\u2019t help in the approximately 25% of heatstroke cases where children get into cars on their own and get trapped, they say.\n\n\u201cThe proposed agreement is inadequate and will give families a false sense of security,\u201d child-safety group Kidsandcars.org said. \u201cA simple \u2018alert\u2019 to check the back seat when the engine is turned off is not enough.\u201d The group also said a voluntary agreement, as opposed to a law, isn\u2019t adequate to protect consumers.\n\nThe number of hot-car deaths has been increasing despite efforts from child-safety groups, hospital-education programs, product developers and a steady stream of media coverage. These efforts face the same challenge: Many people don\u2019t believe this could ever happen to them. \u201cAs most of these deaths are caused by children being unintentionally left in vehicles, our members are taking action to prevent these tragic losses,\u201d Association of Global Automakers chief executive John Bozzella said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying this is a perfect solution and technology will always improve, but this gets us a long way toward where we need to be, and gets us there quicker than hoping the bill gets floor time in the House and Senate, gets to conference, and gets to the president,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, who sponsored the Senate bill along with Sens. Maria Cantwell (D.,Wash.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.). \u201cThis is a huge win and babies are going to live because of this.\u201d\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), who sponsored the House legislation, criticized the commitment\u2019s voluntary nature and said the target date of 2025 was too slow. \u201cIt should be mandated,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe lives of our children are too important to slow roll the use of available technology.\u201d\n\nJanette Fennell, president and founder of kidsandcars.org, said the group will continue to pursue legislation requiring cars to install technology that can detect a back-seat occupant. \u201cWe are going to be pushing big-time to get a federal regulation in place,\u201d Ms. Fennell said. Hyundai and Kia already offer motion-detection capabilities.\n\nDoors already have sensors in them, so the additional costs to auto makers of a door-based reminder would be minimal, said Sam Abuelsamid, an automotive-technology analyst at Navigant Research. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of adding software that would cost a few dollars per car at most, probably less,\u201d Mr. Abuelsamid said.\n\nUltrasonic motion sensors are relatively inexpensive and likely cost less than $10 for each sensor, he said. But added to the software costs, the extra hardware adds a layer of complexity that would make for higher production costs than the door-based system, he said.\n\nSeveral auto makers already offer rear-seat reminder systems or have committed to installing different technologies to alert drivers to check the back seat. General Motors began offering reminder systems in 2016. Nissan last year made a similar pledge, and Hyundai and Honda this summer committed to using reminder technology on most of their cars by 2022. Ford said Wednesday that it will begin to roll out its rear-occupant alert system in some of its 2020 model year vehicles and will fully roll it out well ahead of the 2025 model-year deadline.\n\nWrite to Ellen Byron at ellen.byron@wsj.com", "description": "Industry groups plan rear-seat technology on nearly all cars and trucks by 2025 to help avoid children being left in cars; child-safety group calls the plan inadequate.", "authors": ["Ellen Byron", "Ben Foldy", "Ellen.Byron Wsj.Com", "Ben.Foldy Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103825/social"}
