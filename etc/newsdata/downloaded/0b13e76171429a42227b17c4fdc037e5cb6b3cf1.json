MPs voted by 328 votes to 301 to back the motion.\n\nTuesday's vote will allow MPs to attempt to fast-track legislation through parliament in order to force the prime minister to ask for a three-month extension to negotiations if a deal is not agreed between the EU and the U.K. by October's European Council.\n\nFollowing the rebellion, which Johnson made clear he saw as a vote of confidence in his premiership, he is now expected to ask MPs to allow him to call an election on October 14 \u2014 three days before the crunch EU summit.\n\nJohnson will dare Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been calling for a election, to abandon efforts to legislate against no deal, and fight an election in just over a month's time. For an election to take place, two thirds of MPs must support it meaning it cannot pass without support from the opposition.\n\nCorbyn welcomed Tuesday's defeat for the government. \"We live in a parliamentary democracy. Prime ministers govern with the consent of the House of Commons representing the people in whom the sovereignty rests,\" he told MPs in the House of Commons. \"There is no consent in this house to leave the EU without a deal. There is a no majority for no deal in the country.\"\n\nThe Labour leader added that he would not support a motion to call a general election until parliament had ensured Britain would avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "The prime minister said he regarded the vote as one of confidence in his premiership.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson", "Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55439692-1-1200x628.jpg"}
