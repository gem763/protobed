Chris Coons (D-DE) shared his displeasure with the \u201cLock him up\u201d chants directed at President Donald Trump during Game 5 of the World Series in Washington, D.C.\n\nCoons said even if the president\u2019s \u201cdisturbing\u201d actions may not deserve respect, the office of the president is always deserving of respect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enough of a traditionalist about our institutions that even at a time when there is a lot that our president does that I find disturbing, offensive, unconventional, I have a hard time with a crowd on a globally-televised sporting event chanting \u2018Lock him up\u2019 about our president,\u201d Coons told host John Berman. \u201cI frankly think the office of the president deserves respect even when the actions of our president, at times, don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI certainly hope that we won\u2019t hear \u2018Lock him up\u2019 chants at Democratic rallies or at our convention. I think that\u2019s one of the most regrettable, even at times despicable, actions by candidate Trump when he was running for president in 2016.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During a Monday appearance on CNN's \"New Day,\" Sen.
