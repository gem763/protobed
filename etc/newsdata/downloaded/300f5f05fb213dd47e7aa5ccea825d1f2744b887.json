The founder of worldwide fashion brand Kenzo \u2013 which has its headquarters in the French capital \u2013 admits that while London in the mid-1960s was a \u201cvery dynamic and interesting\u201d place to be, it wasn\u2019t the swinging British capital that held sway in his imagination \u2013 it was Paris. \u201cWhen I was growing up in Japan and wanted to enter the industry, fashion was really in Paris\u2026 I was driven to go to the capital of fashion.\u201d\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The French style icon bringing change\n\n- The dress that made the world gasp\n\n- Rebirth of the grand fashion houses\n\nTakada was far from being alone in his sentiments. Despite the fact that Paris had competition from London and New York, as well as that the \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of French couture had ended the previous decade, in the late 1950s, many at the time, French and otherwise, believed that Paris was still the fashion capital of the world, if there was one. Little seems to have changed. Just as Takada\u2019s eponymous label is still located in the City of Lights, so Paris \u2013 the focus of an exhibition running at New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology \u2013 continues to be regarded as the epitome of all that is fashionable. But why? What makes the French so chic?\n\nIt is actually outside Paris, in nearby Versailles, that the story of French fashion truly begins. During the reign of Louis XIV (1643-1715), the court invested heavily in the arts \u2013 and fashion. Visitors to Versailles would be dazzled by not only the \u2018Sun King\u2019 himself, but also the palace\u2019s many courtiers and mistresses, who set trends both in France and abroad. According to Dr Valerie Steele, curator of Paris, Capital of Fashion and editor of the show\u2019s accompanying book, this emphasis on fashion stemmed from far more than just aesthetics. \u201cThe theatre of power was very important,\u201d she tells BBC Designed. \u201c[Louis XIV] wanted to make sure that his appearance and the appearance of his courtiers were in accordance with his idea of being a modern, powerful, civilised monarch \u2013 no longer just a warrior king from the Middle Ages, but a real kind of \u2018Sun King\u2019 with all kinds of mythological connotations. And obviously fashion and ceremonial dress\u2026 were a big part of that.\u201d\n\nFashion icons like Marie Antoinette led many to associate Paris with fashion and sensual pleasure\n\nLouis XIV\u2019s sartorial investments were incredibly fruitful, and he came to be viewed as a monarchical paragon. \u201cEverybody [wanted] to look and act like [him],\u201d says Steele. It wasn\u2019t only soft power and cultural branding, however, that Louis XIV was concerned with. In fashion, he and his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, saw enormous economic potential, too. Accordingly, they together strove to keep out foreign competition and protect the local textile industry, which they also provided with substantial funding. \u201cColbert said that \u2018Fashion will be for France what the gold mines of Peru are for Spain,\u2019\u201d says Steele. \u201cThis [belief] would be central to their economic agenda, which is remarkable, because three-and-a-half centuries later, it\u2019s still true: [fashion] is a major pillar of the French economy.\u201d\n\nFollowing the death of Louis XIV, the courtiers at Versailles began spending more time in Paris. Coupled with the emergence of fashion icons like Marie Antoinette, this led many to associate Paris with \u201cfashion and sensual pleasure\u201d, as Steele writes in the exhibition\u2019s book. The French Revolution may have caused a lull in this respect, but, thanks to the rakish incroyables and their merveilleuses (members of a fashionable aristocratic subculture in the post-Revolutionary period), fashion was far from forgotten. It would only be a matter of time before the Ancien R\u00e9gime would be looked back on \u2013 at least in terms of style \u2013 with nostalgia and admiration.\n\nPower dressing\n\nEven though it had lost the title of the world\u2019s greatest superpower to Britain, France\u2019s superiority in fashion \u2013 and all forms of high culture, for that matter \u2013 persisted well after the fall of the First French Empire. In contrast to London, which excelled in menswear, Paris\u2019s focus was on womenswear. French fashion revolved around the idea of la Parisienne \u2013 the ideal Parisian woman, stylish, cultured, and discerning \u2013 and Paris itself was referred to in the feminine, and even anthropomorphised as a woman. But for all its prestige and renown, French fashion operated on a small scale until the British designer Charles Frederick Worth set up shop in Paris in the mid-19th Century. \u201cYou had plenty of couturiers,\u201d says Steele, \u201cbut\u2026 they were mostly small-scale artisans\u201d.\n\nWorth revolutionised the French fashion industry by introducing the concept of grande couture. For the first time in the country, high fashion was being produced on a large scale. However, Worth, who also founded the Chambre Syndicale to regulate and provide a framework for the French fashion industry, later spoke not of grande or large-scale couture, but haute (meaning \u2018high\u2019) couture. \u201cThat,\u201d says Steele, \u201cwas definitely a way of differentiating [grande couture] from the simultaneous rise of confection, the first round of ready-to-wear clothing, sold in department stores in France\u2026 He claimed that [haute couture] was an art form and that he was an artist.\u201d\n\nToday haute couture is often used as a catchall term for luxury clothing in general, but in France \u2013 and in fashion circles generally \u2013 it\u2019s an appellation reserved only for designers who meet a rigorous set of criteria. Also contrary to popular belief, haute couture pieces aren\u2019t necessarily one-of-a-kind. \u201c[Haute] couture is not unique,\u201d says Steele. \u201cIt\u2019s made for your body, but it\u2019s not unique.\u201d\n\nMuch in the spirit of Louis XIV, the French once again used haute couture as a means of soft power in the aftermath of both their defeat at the hands of the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and the Paris Commune (1871), when a revolutionary socialist government briefly seized power. If they were clearly no longer a significant economic or political force, the French at least had their culture and their clothes. \u201cIt was\u2026 no coincidence,\u201d writes Dr David Gilbert of Royal Holloway University in an essay entitled Paris, New York, London, Milan: Paris and a World Order of Fashion Capitals, \u201cthat the aggressive promotion of the couture system\u2026 followed the military humiliation of the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent traumas of the 1871 Commune.\u201d Gilbert goes on to say that \u201cParis fashion\u2026 under the Third Republic\u2026 was part of a wider external reassertion of French power and influence abroad\u201d. And, in trying to reassert themselves on the world stage, the French, as Steele says, \u201c[equated] France [with] civilisation and Germany [with] barbarity, which [became] part of a longstanding French ethos\u201d.\n\nThe French did the Sun King proud. Even after the further devastations brought about by the two world wars, New York \u2013 the undisputed economic centre of the world \u2013 largely took its sartorial cues from Paris in the early and mid-20th Century. \u201cThe Chambre Syndicale,\u201d writes Gilbert,\u201c\u2026 promoted the idea of the surpassing taste of Paris\u2019s women, but the lasting power came from the way that this idea was repeated, often uncritically as almost a fact of nature, in fashion promotion and media based in other major cities. And nowhere was this more powerful and of more significance both locally and for the wider geographies of fashion than in the \u2018capital of the 20th Century\u2019, New York City.\u201d\n\nIt might seem strange that a city as ambitious and powerful as New York would promote Parisian fashion over its own; but there were clear reasons for this, as Steele is quick to point out. \u201cA lot of the [US] magazines like Vogue and Harper\u2019s Bazaar were for socially elite people,\u201d she says. \u201cThese people had been travelling for decades to Paris to get couture wardrobes\u2026 They were heavily invested.\u201d Steele also mentions a feeling of nostalgia many around the world felt for \u201cthe glamour they [associated] with French fashion\u201d. That said, the rage for French fashion in the US was double-edged, as cheap copies of French haute couture designs abounded, many North Americans being at the time more than willing to settle for far less than the real thing. \u201cYou know,\u201d remarks Steele, \u201ca little black dress, a cheap ready-made copy from New York or Berlin, [looked] pretty damn similar to a Chanel couture version\u201d.\n\nGolden age\n\nIn the late 1940s and early \u201950s, designers like Christian Dior, Gabrielle \u2018Coco\u2019 Chanel, and Hubert de Givenchy ushered in what\u2019s now referred to as the \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of French fashion, and there was no doubt of Paris\u2019s supremacy in womenswear. Things got a bit more complicated in the mid-\u201960s, however, with London\u2019s \u2018youthquake\u2019, led by the likes of Mary Quant, while the 1970s and \u201980s saw the rise of Milan and Tokyo as major fashion centres. And if the \u2018defection\u2019 of many Japanese designers to France \u00e0 la Takada quelled the threat from the East, Paris \u2013 despite enjoying a renaissance of sorts with designers like Christian Lacroix and Jean-Paul Gaultier \u2013 faced increasing pressure from London and New York, rivals old and new, in the late \u2019 80s and \u201990s. \u201cBut they kept pushing back,\u201d says Steele of the French.\n\nThrough soft power and cultural branding, the emergence of haute couture, and the assiduous promotion of French fashion on behalf of the French, as well as vested tastemakers abroad, Paris came to enjoy a reputation of seemingly irrefutable chicness. But today, considering the status of cities like London, Milan, and New York, and the increasing globalisation of the fashion industry \u2013 \u201c[Fashion] is pretty much all over the world,\u201d as Kenzo Takada puts it \u2013 can Paris still be talked about as the fashion capital of the world?\n\nAccording to Steele, Paris still reigns internationally as a fashion metropolis for a variety of reasons. For one, it\u2019s home to some of the world\u2019s most prominent fashion conglomerates. \u201cFashion is no longer a question so much of small independent businesses,\u201d she states, \u201cbut of giant conglomerates. Almost all the luxury groups \u2013 LVMH, Kering, etc \u2013 are based in Paris, [despite having] bought up Italian companies [and] invested in English [and] American ones.\u201d Steele also believes Parisian fashion shows to be superior to those held in other cities. \u201cIt\u2019s not as thrilling to go to Milan. [And] I mean, New York is a wonderful place, but the New York fashion shows don\u2019t have the glamour and excitement that the ones in Paris do, for the most part.\u201d\n\nParis is quite unique for the quality and level of the shows of its fashion week \u2013 Isabel Marant\n\nHer opinion is echoed by Paris-based designer Agn\u00e8s b: \u201cThey\u2019ve tried with Milan and London, [and] with New York \u2013 there are shows everywhere,\u201d she tells BBC Designed, \u201cbut inspiration comes from Paris, for sure\u201d. Similarly, designer Isabel Marant, also based in Paris, points to the grandeur of the city\u2019s fashion shows, too, in commenting on its status as the world\u2019s fashion capital. \u201cParis,\u201d says Marant, \u201cis quite unique for the way that fashion is expressed [there], for the quality and level of the shows of its fashion week.\u201d\n\nNow there\u2019s a new generation of designers, but Paris has still this aura \u2013 Agn\u00e8s b\n\nThe presence of major conglomerates in Paris and the quality of its contemporary fashion shows are certainly important to consider. History, though, is perhaps the crucial element in the continued perception of Paris as the epicentre of fashion \u2013 regardless of whether the historical associations being made are rational or the result of clever marketing done by the French and others with a stake in French fashion. \u201cFrance has always been \u2026 [introducing] new ways of wearing clothes,\u201d says Agn\u00e8s b. \u201cIt has always been [this way] in France. We\u2019ve had this for a long time.\u201d Marant agrees: \u201cFrance has a great cultural heritage,\u201d she tells BBC Designed, mentioning the likes of Paul Poiret, Elsa Schiaparelli, and Chanel, who \u201ccreated new trends [and were] admired all over the world\u201d. And as Agn\u00e8s b points out: \u201cNow [there\u2019s] a new generation [of designers], but Paris has still this aura, I think.\u201d\n\nIt may seem strange to place so much emphasis on Paris\u2019s sartorial past, no matter how dazzling it may be. As Gilbert writes, however, \u201cThe status of fashion capital in the 21st Century is as much about reputation, expectations, heritage, and tradition as the design and production of actual garments\u2026 Deep and long-running symbolic associations also have real economic and cultural consequences.\u201d Steele puts it slightly more casually. \u201cThe law of precedents is really important. If you\u2019ve been the fashion capital longest and have this amazing reputation, then you can ding it around the corners an awful lot and it still comes out looking like, \u2018Oh yeah, it\u2019s still the best!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn light of such arguments, one is hard pressed to deny the primacy of Paris as a fashion capital. But what about the future? Do those who feel Paris to be the world\u2019s fashion capital think the title could potentially be seized by another? \u201cOf course anything can change,\u201d says Steele, who suggests Shanghai as a possible contender, on account of China\u2019s growing economic clout. And, though they don\u2019t single out any particular cities, Takada and Marant also raise the issue of increasing international competition and the proliferation of fashion shows around the world. \u201cThere are many cities [also] showing\u2026 very interesting [styles and] emerging talents,\u201d Marant admits. Considering, however, the immense role played by heritage and history in forming perceptions of cities as fashion capitals, it seems unlikely that Paris, the fabled \u2018Queen of the World\u2019, will budge from her throne anytime soon, if at all.\n\nParis, Capital of Fashion is on display at the Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, until 4 January 2020.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.
