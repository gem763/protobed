FBI Special Agent Bradon LaMar wrote in an affidavit that Smith had disseminated information on building improvised explosive devices and had \u201cspoken about his desire to travel to Ukraine to fight with the Ukraine-based violent far-right paramilitary group, Azov Battalion.\u201d\n\nBefore he joined the military in 2017, Smith reportedly connected with Craig Lang, who had traveled to Ukraine to fight with another right-wing group called Right Sector. In late 2018, Smith allegedly wrote about his ability to make cell phone IEDs. Then, last month, Smith discussed a plan to conduct an attack in the United States with a FBI confidential source. Smith, the FBI said, talked with the informant \u201cabout killing members of the far left group, Antifa, as well as destroying nearby cell towers or [a] local news station.\u201d He also suggested bombing the headquarters of a \u201cmajor American news network.\u201d\n\nThen, in a discussion on the app Telegram with an FBI undercover employee, Smith reportedly offered instructions on building a IED, though the FBI affidavit also says that some of the instructions would not create a \u201cviable explosive device.\u201d\n\nThe undercover FBI employee solicited Smith to suggest potential targets for \u201cfire, destruction and death.\u201d Smith allegedly offered up the name Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman from Texas and current Democratic presidential candidate. In a subsequent interview, Smith reportedly admitted to providing information on explosive devices in an attempt to cause \u201cchaos.\u201d\n\nDomestic terrorism, which has caused more deaths than foreign terrorism in the U.S. in recent years, has proved a difficult challenge for federal law enforcement, which lacks tools to go after potential acts of terror inspired by designated foreign terrorist organizations like the Islamic State. FBI Director Chris Wray told lawmakers in July that the FBI had been involved in 100 domestic terrorism arrests in the first nine months of the 2019 fiscal year.", "description": "The soldier allegedly discussed traveling to Ukraine to join an extremist group.", "authors": ["Reporter", "Senior Justice Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8900952300009705d62214.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
