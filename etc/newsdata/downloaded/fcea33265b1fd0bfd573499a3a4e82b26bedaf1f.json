Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization. \"The data is being analyzed.\"\n\nA successful landing would have made India just the fourth country to land a vessel on the lunar surface, and only the third nation to operate a robotic rover there.\n\nThe roughly $140-million US mission, known as Chandrayaan-2, was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits that were confirmed by the Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008.\n\nModi had travelled to the space centre in Bengaluru to witness the planned landing in the early hours of Saturday and congratulate scientists who were part of the mission.\n\nThe space agency's chairman had earlier called Chandrayaan-2 the \"most complex mission ever\" undertaken by the space agency.\n\nThe mission lifted off on July 22 from the Satish Dhawan space centre, in Sriharikota, an island off the coast of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nAfter its launch on July 22, Chandrayaan-2 spent several weeks making its way to the moon, ultimately entering lunar orbit on Aug. 20.\n\nOn Sept. 2, Vikram separated from the mission's orbiter, and the lander began a series of braking manoeuvres to lower its orbit and ready itself for landing.\n\nOnly three nations \u2014 the United States, the former Soviet Union and China \u2014 have landed spacecraft on the moon.\n\nLast January, China achieved the first landing on the far side of the moon. In April, an Israeli spacecraft attempting to land crashed moments before touchdown.", "description": "India's space agency says it has lost communication with its Chrandrayaan-2 spacecraft, although it is not clear if the mission has failed.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5211707.1563143294!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/india-moon-mission.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
