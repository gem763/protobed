White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham tweeted that her boss hadn\u2019t seen it, but \u201cbased upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns\u201d it.\n\nCampaign officials also say they hadn\u2019t seen it. So did Donald Trump Jr. and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, both of whom spoke at the conference, at Trump National Doral Miami, where it was played.\n\nAnd the organizer for the conference, the pro-Trump group American Priority, denounced the video.\n\nBut a participant at the Miami conclave was concerned enough to use an intermediary to slip the footage to the New York Times.\n\nJust to be clear, this is not one of the satiric videos that the president has retweeted, like the WWE-style one showing a Trump character body-slamming a guy with a CNN head.\n\nWHITE HOUSE CONDEMNS FAKE VIDEO SHOWING TRUMP SHOOTING JOURNALISTS\n\n\u201cThe most violent clip,\u201d says the Times, \u201cshows Mr. Trump\u2019s head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the \u2018Church of Fake News\u2019 on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what happens:\n\n\u201cMany parishioners\u2019 faces have been replaced with the logos of news media organizations, including PBS, NPR, Politico, The Washington Post and NBC.\n\nMr. Trump stops in the middle of the church, pulls a gun out of his suit jacket pocket and begins a graphic rampage. As the parishioners try to flee, the president fires at them. He shoots Black Lives Matter in the head, and also shoots Vice News.\n\n\u201cFrom there, Mr. Trump attacks a range of his critics. He strikes the late Arizona senator John McCain in the back of the neck. He hits the television personality Rosie O\u2019Donnell in the face and then stabs her in the head. He strikes Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California. He lights the head of Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential rival, on fire.\n\n\u201cHe takes Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, hostage before throwing him to the ground. Then he strikes former President Barack Obama in the back and throws him against a wall. The clip ends with Mr. Trump putting a stake into the head of a person with a CNN logo for a face.\u201d\n\nHilarious, no?\n\nA CNN statement said, \u201cSadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the president have promoted violence against the media in a video\u2026but it is by far and away the worst.\u201d\n\nThe piece says parts of the video were posted on YouTube last year by a user with a record of creating pro-Trump mashups.\n\nPut the targets aside for one minute. In this era of mass shootings, why would even the most rabid partisan want to promote video of a massacre? We\u2019ve already endured actual massacres in a church, in South Carolina, and a synagogue, in Pittsburgh.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve already seen violent nutjobs target political and media figures, from the man who opened fire at a Republican baseball practice to the pipe bomber who mailed explosives to prominent Democrats and CNN.\n\nI\u2019ve been just as vociferous about a play, a video and other imagery (such as Kathy Griffin holding up a severed head) that portrays Trump as being killed. Griffin is murdered in the pro-Trump video and has denounced it.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nThe video seems indiscriminate in depicting other Trump targets, including not just Obama but Bill and Hillary Clinton, CBS, HuffPost, Mika Brzezinski, Adam Schiff and\u2026Harvey Weinstein?\n\nThe conference organizer said the macabre video, apparently adapted from a dark comedic film from 2014, was shown as part of a \u201cmeme exhibit.\u201d\n\nWho on the planet thought this was a good idea to bring to a gathering with various Trump World luminaries?\n\nDid those involved expect a standing ovation? Raucous laughter? An invitation to the White House?\n\nWe need to know more about who created this travesty, and people of every political stripe should condemn it.", "description": "It\u2019s just beyond sickening.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/14/694940094001_6094767346001_6094763065001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
