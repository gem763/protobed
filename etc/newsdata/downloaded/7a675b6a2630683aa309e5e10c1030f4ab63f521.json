They like a deal. If they can get something for $50, that\u2019s better than paying $75. Paying $30 is even better.\n\nSecond, people don\u2019t like to be told how to save money. Especially when those suggestions deal with strongly held personal preferences.\n\nIt\u2019s also well-established that people hate having to change their habits to help themselves out financially. You can see scores of evidence that backs this up \u2014 massive credit card debt, extremely low retirement savings, a good percentage having low to no savings, and so on.\n\nThis leaves many in a quandary when they hear a great money saving tip that is too awesome to pass up, but requires them to change their habits. Should they love it because it saves them a bundle? Or should they hate it because it forces them to do something not in their nature?\n\nI\u2019m going to share five money-saving tips that people hate, but that doesn\u2019t bother me. In fact, I enjoy stirring the pot a bit now and then.\n\nHated saving tip No. 1: Move to a lower cost-of-living location\n\nThis tip recognizes that there are different costs to living in various parts of the world. In New York City an annual living budget might cost $XX while in St. Louis it may cost 60% of that. A foreign country may cost even less than that.\n\nHow much it can save you: This tip can save you hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime \u2014 maybe $1 million.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: This calculator will reveal that if you make $100,000 in Cincinnati, you need to make $208,667 to have the same lifestyle in San Francisco. In reverse, if you make $100k in San Francisco, you can live the same lifestyle in Cincinnati for $47,923.\n\nTake an extra $52,077 each year for 20 or 30 years and see what that adds up to.\n\nBetter yet, invest that amount each year and you\u2019ll see the difference is millions of dollars.\n\nWhy people hate this advice\n\nGenerally, people like where they live and they don\u2019t want to move, so suggesting they should move is heresy.\n\nExcuses used to refute this advice\n\nThere are various excuses people use for why this tip is not true (or at least not worthwhile). The most popular are:\n\n\u2022 There are higher salaries in higher cost of living locations which more than offset the higher costs\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s a quality-of-life issue to living in one city very another \u2014 usually expressed in terms of \u201cthis city has so much to do\u201d\n\n\u2022 They have family in the city and want to be near them\n\nAny excuse is just that, an excuse. Obviously people can live wherever they like. They just need to realize they are paying through the nose to live in some areas of the country. If that\u2019s their choice, that\u2019s their choice.\n\nThe excuse shows up when they try to deny the cost of living differences and claim they aren\u2019t spending more in an expensive city. They are living in denial.\n\nThe \u201chigher salary\u201d argument is dubious at best. There are differing points of view on this one but more often than not the data falls into the lower cost market being a better option financially.\n\nThe \u201cquality of life\u201d argument always seems to focus on the positives but leaves out the negatives. Yes, New York City has great museums which you may use once or twice a year. But do you want an hour-long, one-way commute (if you\u2019re lucky) each day to work? Is that a great quality of life choice?\n\nOh, and is \u201cI can get any type of food at 3 a.m.\u201d really worth $20,000 in extra expenses a year? Probably not since those 3 a.m. food runs often disappear once a couple settles down and has kids.\n\nBut there\u2019s \u201cculture\u201d in this city? And not in other cities? And you can\u2019t live one place and visit a different city now and then? Come on.\n\nI will admit that the \u201cliving near family\u201d reason is valid for many. Again, if people recognize the cost and willingly take it on to be near family, fine. But most don\u2019t. Instead they claim that the costs are the same so they can feel good about living next to family.\n\nWhen it gets worse\n\nThis idea receives even more hatred when moving to a foreign country is suggested. No one wants to hear that they can cut their living costs in half by moving to Mexico or Thailand. It just seems too crazy.\n\nBut there are huge savings moving to a foreign country even compared with \u201ccheap\u201d U.S. cities like Pittsburgh or Oklahoma City. In fact, if you pick the right cities you can cut the cost of retirement in half. This should be great news for Americans who, on average, haven\u2019t saved much for retirement.\n\nThe key objections to this idea are that a foreign country is unsafe and has terrible health care. Yes, there are some unsafe countries and areas but you can avoid them (just like there are places in the U.S. you want to avoid).\n\nAnd here\u2019s a news flash, the U.S. is way down the line in world rankings of best health care countries (currently #37). You can actually get BETTER care for LESS money in many foreign countries.\n\nThe optimal financial solution\n\nThe best option to maximize net worth is to have a high income while living in a low cost city. If you do this, you can save a fortune and hopefully retire early.\n\nIf you choose otherwise and want to live in an expensive city, then that\u2019s OK. Just recognize that it\u2019s costing you a massive amount of money and will delay retirement a decade or two.\n\nIf you hated this tip, you\u2019ll really despise the next one.\n\nHated saving tip No. 2: Don\u2019t get a pet\n\nJust like the others on my list, I really don\u2019t mind if people spend on pets as long as they recognize the costs and make the decision to have a pet intentionally. But this doesn\u2019t happen in many cases.\n\nMost of the time pet owners live in denial of the high expenses associated with pet ownership. They look at the average costs (as we\u2019re about to do) and say something like, \u201cMy dog doesn\u2019t cost that much.\u201d OK, well I guess it\u2019s other people\u2019s dogs that cost a ton of money since yours costs zero, huh? Yeah, right.\n\nHow much pets cost\n\nSome of you might accuse me of being a pet hater. I am not a pet hater. But you may try to discredit my numbers because you think I don\u2019t like pets.\n\nFor this reason let\u2019s begin our look at pet costs by using numbers provided by an organizations that LOVE pets. If anything, they have the incentive to lowball the cost of pets, so if their numbers are high, then they must be correct, right?\n\nThe ASPCA is quoted on numerous sites including this piece from Forbes. They list the cost of pets as follows:\n\n\u2022 Over 15 years, total costs for a small dog could run from $17,560 to upward of $93,520.\n\n\u2022 Over a 12-year lifetime, the costs of a large dog range from $22,025 to upward of $82,929 for folks using dog walkers.\n\n\u2022 All told, cost of cats will be at least $780 a year and $16,800 over its possible 15-year existence.\n\nI\u2019m skipping birds, hamsters, fish, and the like but all of their costs are listed. Hint: Horses are absolute financial killers.\n\nBut let\u2019s not stop there. Here are a few other sources talking about the cost of pets (we\u2019ll focus on dogs and cats as they are the most popular pets):\n\n\u2022 American Kennel Club \u2014 \u201cThe average lifetime cost of raising a dog is $23,410.\u201d\n\n\u2022 US News \u2014 \u201cRaisingSpot.com, which provides tips on raising a dog, suggests a dog that lives 12 years might cost you anywhere between $4,620 and $32,990.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Pet Place \u2014 \u201cAn indoor cat\u2019s total estimated lifetime cost is $8,620 to $11,275.\u201d Note: Outdoor cats live much shorter lives and thus cost less.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s even a pet cost calculator if you want to find the cost of your pet.\n\nTo summarize, a dog is going to cost roughly $20,000 while cats will be closer to $10,000.\n\nNow, if you own multiple animals at the same time, not to mention several over the course of your adult lifetime, we\u2019re talking a massive amount of money. I\u2019ll get to that in a moment.\n\nWhy people hate this advice\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you already hate the advice and we\u2019re not even really into it. You may hate me as well.\n\nOverall people dislike this advice because they LOVE their pets. Some even compare them to children. So they hate the advice because having a pet is in most cases not a financial decision, it\u2019s more of an emotional/lifestyle one. Which, as I said earlier, is something I\u2019m fine with. It\u2019s your money, do what you want with it. I\u2019m only here to bring light to the fact that pets are very expensive and if you ever want to achieve financial independence you may want to consider just how much Fido is setting you back.\n\nExcuses used to refute this advice\n\nHere\u2019s where the excuses begin. But there\u2019s one that leads the pack by far: \u201cMy dog/cat doesn\u2019t cost anywhere near that much. I pay $30 a month to feed him and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nUh, no it\u2019s not. Here\u2019s a list of expenses you just left out:\n\n\u2022 Vaccines\n\n\u2022 Flea/tick control\n\n\u2022 Heartworm prevention\n\n\u2022 Ear and dental care\n\n\u2022 Grooming\n\n\u2022 Food (Premium?)\n\n\u2022 Toys\n\n\u2022 House (fenced backyard? cleaning? etc.)\n\n\u2022 Crate\n\n\u2022 Bowls, collar, leash/harness\n\n\u2022 Cost of pet (if from breeder)\n\n\u2022 Boarding\n\n\u2022 Training\n\n\u2022 Walking (yes, some people pay walkers)\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the big one: medical costs. This is where things get really pricey, especially toward the end of a pet\u2019s life. In addition you can spend on a whole host of things including pet massages, acupuncture, and psychiatrists. You think I\u2019m kidding.\n\nThe costs add up to seven figures\n\nAs I said earlier, how you spend your money is your choice. You simply need to realize that two dogs throughout your 50-year adulthood will run you somewhere around $150k. That\u2019s $3,000 a year.\n\n$3,000 a year saved and invested at 8% for 50 years equals $1.7 million.\n\nEven if you spend \u201conly\u201d half that amount, it\u2019s still costing you a fortune.\n\nNow that you understand how much your pets cost you, you can make an informed decision about where to spend and where to save.\n\nWell, things are rocking now. Have I offended everyone yet?\n\nLet\u2019s move on and I\u2019ll begin to nickel and dime you to wealth.\n\nHated saving tip No. 3: Reduce small spending\n\nFor this one we need to begin with a definition. What exactly is \u201csmall spending\u201d?\n\nSmall spending is little, inexpensive purchases here and there that accumulate during a day. Think a candy bar at a vending machine, muffin at a bakery, or soda at a convenience store. It\u2019s usually minimal (under $5) and often goes unnoticed.\n\nDavid Bach brought small spending to the big time in his book \u201cThe Automatic Millionaire.\u201d He coined the phrase \u201cthe latte factor\u201d to represent and highlight \u201cthose small expenses many of us don\u2019t even think much about spending\u2014whether it\u2019s a cup of coffee, fast food, or ATM fees.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s now even a book out titled \u201cThe Latte Factor.\u201d\n\nWhy small spending is bad for your finances\n\nThe problem with small spending is that it adds up \u2014 and it adds up big. Just $5 a day spent here and there is worth well over $1 million when invested over the course of a person\u2019s working lifetime. If that money is put into a work 401(k) and matched, it doubles.\n\nImagine you have a bucket full of water (representing your income). Now make a tiny hole in the bottom, one so small and obscure that few would notice it. Then wait a while. It doesn\u2019t take long for the water to drain out completely and you\u2019re left with nothing. This is exactly the issue with small spending \u2014 it can drain your finances quickly and secretly.\n\nWhy people hate the idea\n\nMost dislike this tip because they say it takes the fun out of life. People work hard and want to spend on things that give them a bit of joy \u2014 like a cup of coffee on the way to work.\n\nIf they make a conscious decision to spend $1,300 on coffee a year ($5 coffee, 5 days a week for 52 weeks), that\u2019s their decision. The problem is that so much small spending is like that hole in the bucket. It\u2019s not noticed because it\u2019s so small. It happens here and there and doesn\u2019t seem to add up to much. And then all your money is gone.\n\nThe impact can be significant. That $5 coffee is costing you $1 million. Is it worth it?\n\nHow to manage small spending\n\nNow obviously people can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t eliminate all small spending because it does take some joy out of life. But we can look for alternatives that allow us to enjoy life while also saving money.\n\nFor instance:\n\n\u2022 Instead if a $5 cup of coffee from Starbucks SBUX, -0.30%, how about making your own at home for pennies a cup? This is what I do most of the time.\n\n\u2022 Instead of $1 snacks from the vending machine a few times every day, how about bringing your own healthy snacks to work for $5 a week?\n\n\u2022 Instead of eating $10 lunches out every day, how about bringing your lunch made from leftovers?\n\n\u2022 Instead of paying bank fees of all kinds for this and that, how about being just a bit more diligent with your money so you avoid all fees?\n\nJust by making a few, simple changes you can save several dollars a day. Invest that money wisely and you\u2019ll be handsomely rewarded at retirement.\n\nTwo vital steps\n\nThere are two steps we all need to take to as we work to recognize and limit small spending:\n\nDevelop a cash flow plan and track all spending. Then review the plan regularly to see what\u2019s being spent and where. Once you know this, you can then control and small spending that gets out of hand.\n\nPay yourself first. A great way to make sure your money doesn\u2019t get eaten up by small spending is to save and invest first. Have money transferred automatically from your check each week into savings and investment accounts. Then it will begin working for you immediately and, better yet, be out of your hands and unavailable for small spending.\n\nOK, let\u2019s now take on home sweet home\u2026\n\nHated saving tip No. 4: Buy less of a house than you can afford\n\nHow much it can save you\n\nMost people decide how much house they can afford simply by looking at the monthly mortgage payment \u2014 stretching their budget to its limit or beyond.\n\nLet\u2019s look at it from a different perspective. How much are you giving to the bank to live in their house while you make 360 consecutive monthly payments? An amortization schedule will help show us how much you can save by living in a more modest home. Let\u2019s compare buying a $200,000 home to buying a $125,000 one.\n\n\u2022 $200,000 = Monthly Payment $1,074 = Interest Paid $186,512\n\n\u2022 $125,000 = Monthly Payment $671 = Interest Paid $116,570\n\n\u2022 That\u2019s a saving of nearly $70,000 that can be invested over a 30 year period.\n\nWhy people hate it\n\nYou\u2019ve decided you want the American dream. A little house to call your own and a mortgage to boot. For most people this will be the single largest purchase in their lifetime. It is also the most they will ever pay in interest and we know that debt costs a fortune.\n\nHere\u2019s how the deal usually goes down. You contact that person you went to high school with who is now a real-estate agent. They are so excited to help you, and also to make a quick buck off of your purchase.\n\nYour new best friend says you need to get prequalified by a bank to find out how much you can afford. They know just the person you should talk to as well. The banker and your Realtor want you to spend at the max of your budget, because the more you spend the more they both make off of your purchase.\n\nIf you get approved for $200,000, your Realtor will start by showing you homes priced at $219,900. Most people have eyes bigger than their wallets, so they will reach for the stars when purchasing their \u201cDream Home\u201d, not considering how to furnish it, pay its utilities, maintain its structure, etc.\n\nResearch detailed in \u201cStop Acting Rich:\u2026And Start Living Like A Real Millionaire\u201d proves that the more house you buy, the higher your costs will be in many other areas.\n\nThe excuses they use to refute it\n\nHere are a few of the top excuses people use to combat this money saving suggestion:\n\n\u2022 I am just out of college. I will make more money as I gain experience.\n\n\u2022 I have been with my employer for X years. I always get a bonus and X% raise each year.\n\n\u2022 The housing market increases in value every year by X%.\n\nWhy the excuses are invalid\n\nNo one plans on having a financial crisis in life, but rest assured that everyone will feel a financial pinch. A change in jobs, a loss of a job, day care costs, illness or injury to you or a family member, home maintenance and car repair costs. The pitfalls of life are plentiful and unpredictable.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Just-out-of-college, may make more money in the future. Then he will find a way to spend it. He will find a significant other to spend it on, buy a nicer car, bigger TV, get married and then take vacations. How much more does that next promotion pay? He needs it.\n\nMrs. Long-term-employee goes to work every day doing her job, never thinking that her position may be outsourced, replaced by a computer or that she needs to get continuing education to keep the job.\n\nThe company that gives annual raises and bonuses will hit a rocky financial stretch too, but they watch their finances closer than you or I. If they cannot afford to give you a raise this year, they won\u2019t, even if they have the past 10 years. No bonuses this year either, the sales team didn\u2019t hit their numbers.\n\nIn 2008, the housing market crashed and many found themselves upside-down on their home loans. Those with popular adjustable-rate mortgages may have even seen their payments spike at the same time the home\u2019s value bottomed out. The value of many homes were affected by mass foreclosures. If you went with the biggest mortgage you could find, this period of uncertainty may be all it takes to ruin your personal finances. The housing market\u2019s averages are not guaranteed.\n\nThe more house you buy, the higher your costs and the lower (on average) your net worth. It\u2019s true that the house you buy determines your wealth (inversely).\n\nThe reason why so many homeowners today are having a difficult time making ends meet goes way beyond mortgage payments. When you trade up to a more expensive home, there is a new pressure for you to spend more on every conceivable product and service.\n\nNothing has a greater impact on your wealth and your consumption than your choice of house and neighborhood. If you live in a pricey home in an exclusive community, you will spend more. Your ability to save and build wealth will be compromised.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t realize is that the true cost of living in certain homes and neighborhoods is unseen but truly devastating. The greatest detriment to building wealth is our environment. Human beings have an innate tendency to act and be like those around them \u2014 to fit in \u2014 and even compete. If you live in a pricey neighborhood, you will act and buy like your neighbors.\n\nAffluent neighborhoods are a vortex of sociological forces. It is a marketing fact that residents of more affluent neighborhoods spend more on just about everything. From cars to haircuts and from wine to watches \u2014 they spend more. We take consumption cues from those around us.\n\nResearch has shown that most people who live in million-dollar homes are not millionaires. They may be high-income producers, but they are living a treadmill existence. In the United States, there are three millionaires living in homes with value of under $300,000 for every one living in home valued at $1 million or more.\n\nThe optimal financial solution\n\nNo one wants to do it, that\u2019s why we hate these money saving tips, but here is what you should do instead: Buy a house you can afford.\n\nYour monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income (your income before taxes are taken out). Even better, consider going lower than 28%.\n\nIf you do it the right way, you can buy a great house and have it paid off in 10 years. Imagine the money you\u2019ll save and can now invest \u2014 propelling your net worth higher over the decades to come.\n\nAnd as an alternate suggestion, consider foregoing a house purchase for yourself and instead invest that money in a rental unit (or do house hacking). Then your money doesn\u2019t cost you but actually works for you to help grow a solid net worth. (One great idea is to buy a multiunit place, live in one apartment, and rent out the others.)\n\nLet go of the dream home mirage and have the Dream Life.\n\nOne more to go\u2026the favorite of many Americans\u2026\n\nHated saving tip No. 5: Limit debt\n\nAmerica\u2019s debt problem\n\nAmericans are in love with debt. According to NerdWallet, \u201cthe average household with any kind of debt owes $134,643, including mortgages.\u201d Mortgages, auto loans, student loans, and credit cards are the main contributors to this debt load.\n\nWhy do we love debt? Because we love stuff. We need big houses since that\u2019s what makes us happy. Then we need new cars for the garage. And of course furniture, appliances, electronics, and everything else to fill the house \u2014 so get out the credit cards. Oh, and of course we still have debt from that college degree that was just too expensive for the job we got at graduation.\n\nAdd it all up and it\u2019s a nightmare costing us a fortune \u2014 several hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of our lives.\n\nThe excuses people use to get into debt\n\nBut Americans don\u2019t part with their debt easily. No, we have lots of excuses why debt is good. Here are a few:\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe only house that met our needs was at this (very high) price so we needed to borrow the maximum amount. It\u2019s not that expensive anyway because we get a tax deduction for the interest.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cWe have to furnish the house, right? We just can\u2019t leave it empty. Oh, and we need to go to the Caribbean. Oh, and I need a weekly manicure. Credit cards help tide us over until our next paycheck.\u201d (Reality: the credit cards never get fully paid off.)\n\n\u2022 \u201cI like to drive new cars. So what if it\u2019s a BMW?\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cI thought that as long as I got a college degree that things would work out fine no matter how much I borrowed.\u201d\n\nUgh. What a financial disaster. People are actually rationalizing the debt that\u2019s working to keep them broke.\n\nBetter ways to deal with the big four\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not against spending, but it has to be done in moderation and in proportion to income. For most people this means carrying much lower levels of debt (or even none at all).\n\nHere are some suggestions for dealing with debt in these areas:\n\n\u2022 Buy a house you can afford that leaves plenty of cushion in your budget. Then take steps to pay it off in 10 years. Even with a tax deduction, it\u2019s expensive.\n\n\u2022 When you buy a reasonably priced home, all your associated costs pertaining to it go down. This has such a meaningful financial impact that the price you pay for a home actually determines your net worth. So buy carefully.\n\n\u2022 If you must buy new cars, buy for reliability and do your best to get a great price. This can be done by having dealers compete for your business.\n\n\u2022 Select a college based on its payout \u2014 what it costs versus what you\u2019ll earn with the degree. Help yourself on the cost side by doing all you can to save on college expenses.\n\n\u2022 And for all of these, an old tried and true money principle works like a charm: save in advance and pay cash for as much as you can.\n\nImplement these simple tips, even if you hate them, and you\u2019ll save yourself AT LEAST a few hundred thousand dollars. You can then invest these savings to grow your net worth.\n\nAre we still friends?\n\nThis column originally appeared on ESI Money.
