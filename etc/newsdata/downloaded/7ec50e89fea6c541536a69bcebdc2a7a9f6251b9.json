By 2018-19, this figure had increased to 21,022.\n\nThat averages out to about 58 murders a day.\n\nLast year, there were a total of 52,420 recorded sexual offences.\n\nThis is lower than for the period 2009-15, but over the past three years the rate has been increasing.\n\nIn a statement on the release of the latest figures, the Minister of Police Bheki Cele, said reversing the rising murder trend of the last six years was a \"mammoth task, but is doable\".\n\nMurders and sexual offences since 2010\n\nHe also said there were plans to increase the number of specialist police units dealing with gender violence, as well as recruit and train more women officers.\n\nSouth Africa's parliamentary committee on police has said it is \"unacceptable\" that crime rises every year.\n\n\"The trajectory of crime cannot continue at the current rate and requires a shift in the way we view policing, from being responsive to being more preventive,\" said Tina Joemat-Pettersson, the committee's chairperson.\n\nThe Institute for Security Studies think-tank argued that the latest figures show that increased spending on policing and harsher sentences have not reduced violence.\n\nIt called for more investment in programmes that help with parenting, after-school care and anti-bullying programmes as \"most violent behaviour is learnt in the home or in communities\".\n\nHow does South Africa compare globally?\n\nSouth Africa does have a very high murder rate when you look at other countries.\n\nUnited Nations figures for the number of murders per 100,000 people show that in 2017, only four other countries had a higher rate of homicide - Belize, Honduras, Jamaica and El Salvador.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAnd World Health Organization (WHO) data for 2016 for the murder rate of women and girls puts South Africa amongst the four worst countries.\n\nThis is the latest year for which data is available.\n\nIt is difficult to compare sexual offences because of the different ways police forces around the world record these, and also because there is likely to be significant under-reporting of sexual violence.", "description": "The latest crime figures show rises in both murder and sexual offences over the past year", "authors": ["Reality Check", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17346/production/_108764059_capetown_protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
