But Terry Gilliam is not most filmmakers.\n\nFrom his time as part of the Monty Python comedy troupe on to directing films such as \u201cTime Bandits,\u201d \u201cBrazil,\u201d \u201cThe Fisher King\u201d and \u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\u201d Gilliam has explored the grotesque and the absurd in the human condition, with a particular attention to the flights of fancy we tell ourselves to make the world bearable in its darkest moments and the freedom to be found within the imagination. So the idea that he would become fixated on the \u201cDon Quixote\u201d story, that of a man who lives in a fantasy world of his own making, makes its own sort of sense.\n\nWorking with co-writer Tony Grisoni, Gilliam\u2019s take on \u201cQuixote\u201d has changed over the years, landing on the tale of a successful director of commercials who is feeling artistically unfulfilled. One night the director, Toby (Adam Driver), comes across a bootleg copy of his old student film sold by a gypsy. The little village in Spain where he shot it is not far from where he is currently working and a return trip brings some unsettling discoveries. The young woman (Joana Ribeiro) he thought could be a star has fallen into a rough life as an escort to a treacherous businessman, and the old shoemaker he cast as his Quixote (Pryce) now suffers from delusions that his role was real. Toby soon finds himself doubting what he sees, as the line between reality and the imaginary becomes increasingly convoluted.\n\nThe notion of men falling into a delusion is something of a through-line in Gilliam\u2019s work. Yet it\u2019s hard to see that he has actually learned much after telling variations of this story again and again, and \u201cThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote\u201d feels only surface-level deep. Hooray for creativity and the idea of an authentic self and all that, but that has come to seem too unexamined and easy of a position to take. Thinking how different the world feels from even five years ago, let alone 25, the movie feels at a remove, not so much dated as just distanced, needlessly off on its own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Driver, left, who plays sidekick Sancho Panza, gets feedback from director Terry Gilliam on the set of \u201cThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote.\u201d (Cannes Film Festival)\n\nThe natural reading of the film is that Gilliam has become Quixote, lost in his own mind, yet the filmmaker has insisted that he sees himself as the character of Sancho Panza, faithful servant to the story. Which may explain why within Gilliam\u2019s ultimate telling of the tale, Driver\u2019s character of Toby is put into the role of Panza to Pryce\u2019s Quixote. At least at first.\n\nWorking in a much broader range than he often has on-screen, Driver uses his full, long-limbed body to angularly depict a comic-strip caricature come to life, with a twitchy, pulsing anxiety. As Toby\u2019s grasp on reality becomes more tenuous, Driver becomes more manic and less composed. Pryce brings a deep sympathetic feeling to his portrayal of a man going through his own emotional struggles.\n\nThe film\u2019s editing, overseen by Gilliam\u2019s frequent collaborator Lesley Walker, often feels choppy as if simply trying to make the best of what they ended up with. The camerawork by Nicola Pecorini, another close Gilliam collaborator, makes the most of the film\u2019s locations in Spain, Portugal and the Canary Islands to evocative effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film at times recalls the energy of the run-and-gun films Orson Welles made in Europe during the 1950s and \u201960s, like \u201cMr. Arkadin\u201d or \u201cChimes at Midnight,\u201d and ultimately brings to mind Welles\u2019 own troubled opus, \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind,\u201d finished posthumously. If there\u2019s an upside to Gilliam\u2019s long saga with \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d it\u2019s that the film indeed is now finished and is still unmistakably his.\n\nAnd so while Gilliam has undoubtedly made better films and certainly greater films than \u201cThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote,\u201d there is something about the ridiculous effort and mixed results that make this arguably the most Gilliam-esque. For anyone struggling with whether to give up, concerned that the result will not match the effort, Gilliam seems to be planting a flag \u2014 or more accurately charging a windmill \u2014 to say the effort is the reward.\n\n------------\n\n\u2018The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\u2019\n\nNot rated\n\nRunning time: 2 hours, 12 minutes\n\nPlaying: April 10, Fathom Events theaters across Southern California\n\nSIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter \u00bb\n\nMark.Olsen@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow on Twitter: @IndieFocus", "description": "After decades of false starts, Terry Gilliam's 'The Man Who Killed Don Quixote' is not the disaster it might be, but strong performances by Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce can't save the film from itself.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Mark Olsen Writes About All Kinds Of Movies For The Los Angeles Times As Both A Feature Writer"], "top_image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6989970/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+145/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fca-times.brightspotcdn.com%2F3f%2Feb%2F890ac20d4a39948e0182ea7a1be4%2Fla-1554825019-chlqek33wt-snap-image", "published_at": "2019-04-09"}
