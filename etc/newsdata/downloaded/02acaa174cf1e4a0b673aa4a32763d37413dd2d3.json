The winning bidder also got a bespoke luggage set\n\nAlexander Weaver, a car specialist with RM Sotheby's described it as 'the ultimate supercar'\n\nAccording to the odometer, the car has covered just 21,439km, which is around 13,320 miles\n\nThe cabon-fibre rear spoiler is one of the additions give to the 200mph-plus supercar and is designed to improve downforce in fast corners\n\nThe auctioneer's car specialist added that the McLaren supercar has long been regarded as the benchmark by which all others are compared\n\nThe previous record price paid for a McLaren was another F1 that was sold by Bonhams - also during Monterey Car Week - in 2017 for $15,620,000\n\nAs well as setting a new record for the marque, the F1 LM has also become the third most expensive British motor ever sold to a highest bidder.\n\nThe mantle of the priciest goes to a 1956 Aston Martin DBR1 which sold for a then \u00a322.6million in August 2017 and a 1955 Jaguar D-Type which sold for $21.8million a year earlier - both at the annual RM Sotheby's Monterey showpiece sale.\n\nThe second LM-specification F1 sold with RM Sotheby's for $13,750,000 (\u00a311.3m) in 2015, though the previous record had been held by the first F1 imported to the US.\n\nBuilt a year later in 1995, it sold for $15,620,000 (\u00a312.8m) at a Bonhams' rival sale in 2017, which is also held during Monterey Car Week in California.\n\nA 1965 Aston Martin DB5 ordered by Eon Productions to promote James Bond films Goldfinger and Thunderball was sold at the same event by RM Sotheby's just 24 hours earlier for $6.4million.", "description": "This 1994 F1 LM (Le Mans) with a gold-plated engine bay has become the most expensive McLaren ever sold at auction and the third priciest British-built motor of all time.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
