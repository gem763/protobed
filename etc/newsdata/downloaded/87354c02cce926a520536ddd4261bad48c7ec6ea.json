Stick shakers are designed to warn pilots of an impending stall, which can cause a dangerous loss of control. They\u2019re unmistakably loud for that reason.\n\nBut the airplane was flying normally, nowhere near a stall. The captain ignored it.\n\nAbout 30 seconds later, he noticed an alert on his flight display \u2014 IAS DISAGREE \u2014 which meant that the flight computer had detected a sensor malfunction. This required a bit more attention.\n\nA modern-day passenger airplane is less like a racecar and more like a temperamental printer: you spend more time monitoring and checking systems than you do actually driving the thing. So the captain passed control of the aircraft to the first officer and began the troubleshooting process from memory.\n\nKEY FINDINGS Mistakes began nearly a decade ago when Boeing was caught flat-footed after its archrival Airbus announced a new fuel-efficient plane that threatened the company\u2019s core business. It rushed the competing 737 Max to market as quickly as possible.\n\nIn developing the Max, Boeing not only cut corners, but it touted them as selling points for airlines. Since the 737 Max was the same plane type as its predecessors, pilots would only need a 2.5-hour iPad training to fly its newest iteration.\n\nMCAS is the new software system blamed for the deadly Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes. But its failure in both crashes was the result of Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s reluctance to properly inform pilots of its existence or to regulate it for safety.\n\nThe FAA has admitted to being incompetent when regulating software, and, as a policy, it allows plane manufacturers to police themselves for safety. Nowhere in its amended type certification of the 737 Max is MCAS mentioned. Even still, Boeing only recommends a 30-minute self-study course for pilots on MCAS, rather than additional simulator or classroom instruction.\n\nDespite the two crashes, neither Boeing nor the FAA believes they\u2019ve done anything wrong. A Boeing spokesperson said the company believes the system is still \u201ca robust and effective way for the FAA to execute its oversight of safety.\u201d\n\nLike all commercial aircraft, the Boeing 737 Max has multiple levels of redundancy for its important systems. In the cockpit, there are three flight computers and digital instrument panels operating in parallel: two primary systems and one backup. Each system is fed by an independent set of sensors. In this case, the captain checked both instrument panels against the backup, and he found that the instruments on his side \u2014 the left side \u2014 were getting bad data. So with the turn of a dial, the captain switched the primary displays to only use data from the working sensors on the right side of the airplane. Easy.\n\nAll of this took under a minute, and everything appeared to be back to normal.\n\nAt 1,500 feet of altitude, the takeoff portion of the flight was officially complete, and the first officer began the initial climb. He adjusted the throttle, set the aircraft on its optimal climb slope, and retracted the flaps.\n\nExcept the airplane didn\u2019t climb. It lurched downward, its nose pointed toward the ground.\n\nThe first officer reacted instinctively. He flicked a switch on his control column to counteract the dive. The airplane responded right away, pitching its nose back up. Five seconds later, it dove once again.\n\nThe first officer brought the airplane\u2019s nose up a third time. It pitched back down.\n\nThe 737 MAX was, plain and simple, a stopgap measure\n\nThere was no memorized checklist that seemed to apply to this situation, so the captain reached for the airplane\u2019s Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). The QRH is a series of simple checklists that are designed to help pilots rapidly assess and manage \u201cnon-normal\u201d situations. The idea is that Boeing has thought of every conceivable thing that might happen to one of its airplanes, and it has included all of them in the QRH. Basically, it\u2019s more troubleshooting.\n\nBut nothing in the QRH seemed to apply, either.\n\nOver the next six minutes, as the first officer struggled to control the airplane and the captain searched for the right checklist, PK-LQP climbed and dove over a dozen times. At one point, the airplane pulled out of a 900-foot dive at an airspeed of almost 375 mph, which is uncomfortably close to the 737\u2019s \u201credline\u201d of 390 mph.\n\nWhat emerged was a story of cascading failure\n\nThe flight crew had to figure something out fast before they lost control of the airplane.\n\nThen the third person in the cockpit, who was technically off-duty, \u201cdead-heading\u201d to his next assignment, reportedly spoke up.\n\nWhat about the runaway stabilizer checklist?\n\nIt was a shot in the dark, another checklist. \u201cRunaway trim\u201d occurs when some kind of failure causes an airplane\u2019s horizontal stabilizer to move \u2014 or \u201ctrim\u201d \u2014 when it shouldn\u2019t be moving at all. Usually, this creates a constant up or downforce that the flight crew has to try to counteract for the remainder of the flight. It\u2019s kind of like trying to drive when your wheels are out of alignment.\n\nPK-LQP\u2019s problem was a little different. It was intermittent, temporarily reversible, and it wasn\u2019t even clear if the horizontal stabilizer was causing the problem. But they were running out of options. They followed the checklist and flipped the STAB TRIM switches to CUT OUT on the center console.\n\nThe airplane stopped pitching down. Five seconds passed. Then five minutes. Once again, PK-LQP was under their control and out of danger.\n\nAn hour later, Lion Air flight 043 landed in Jakarta, Indonesia, only a few minutes delayed. Following standard procedure, the captain reported the episode to the airline, and the airline\u2019s maintenance team checked for serious equipment failures, finding none.\n\nThe following morning, PK-LQP, operating as Lion Air flight 610, took off at 6:20AM local time on its way to Pangkal Pinang, Indonesia. Its stick shaker activated just after takeoff. It threw multiple errors on the flight display. It dove just after the flight crew retracted the flaps. And it relentlessly activated its automatic pitch trim in the nose-down direction 28 times over the course of eight minutes.\n\nThis time, there was no third pilot to help the flight crew.\n\nPK-LQP may have reached 600 mph, faster than a Tomahawk missile, as it plunged into the water. It was the first 737 Max accident in its 18 months of service.\n\nLion Air Flight Telemetry\n\nTo industry outsiders, it was a shock. What could have brought down one of Boeing\u2019s newest, most technologically sophisticated airplanes? But those closer to the airplane\u2019s development knew better: there had been warning signs from the start.\n\nThe Verge spoke to a dozen pilots, instructors, engineers, and experts about the 737 Max and its development, rollout, and the two crashes that have claimed the lives of 346 people. What emerged was a story of cascading failure \u2014 the many small human errors at every phase of the airplane\u2019s design, certification, and operation process. Those errors came to a terrible and deadly climax in the skies above the Java Sea in October 2018 and above the Ethiopian countryside five months later.\n\nThe story of the Max is ultimately the story of the Darwinian business cycle where mature companies like Boeing face constant threats from new products, new competitors, and the search for new growth. Sometimes this motivates them to new heights of innovation and progress. Other times, it prompts them to pull everything back in the name of cost-cutting.\n\nThe events that led to these two fatal crashes were set in motion nearly a decade ago, and they started not with Boeing, but with the company\u2019s European archrival, Airbus.\n\nBoeing\u2019s 737 and Airbus\u2019 A320 are the two main players in the massive \u2014 and massively profitable \u2014 market for narrow-body passenger jets. Together, both airplanes comprise nearly half of the world\u2019s 28,000 commercial airliners. Chances are that if you\u2019ve ever flown anywhere at all, you\u2019ve flown on one of them.\n\nBoth manufacturers are locked in a race to make their airplanes cheaper for airlines to operate, especially when it comes to fuel.\n\nIn 2018, for instance, Southwest Airlines\u2019 fleet of 751 Boeing 737s burned through 2.1 billion gallons of fuel at an average cost of $2.20 per gallon for a total of $4.6 billion. A 1 percent increase in fuel efficiency would save $46 million. That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, even for a company that earned $2.5 billion in net profit.\n\nA development cycle can\u2019t be fast, cheap, and good\n\nSo Airbus and Boeing constantly tweak their airplanes to squeeze single percentage-point gains out of them. But complete overhauls are rare: the 737 last received one in 1997, with the debut of the third-generation 737NG, while the A320 hadn\u2019t been refreshed since its launch in 1988.\n\nThen, on December 1st, 2010, Airbus stunned the aviation community. In secret, it had developed a more efficient version of the A320 called the A320neo (which stands for \u201cnew engine option\u201d). It would burn about 6 percent less fuel than the 737NG. That was a stunning leap in fuel efficiency, delivered at a time when the price of jet fuel was at a near-record of $2.50 per gallon.\n\nAirlines loved it. The following summer at the 2011 Paris Air Show, the aerospace industry\u2019s equivalent of Black Friday, Airbus sold a record-setting 667 A320neos in the span of a week. That was more orders than the 737s had received in the entirety of 2010.\n\nBoeing was caught flat-footed. It had spent four years debating the future of its narrow-body jet program, and it still did not have an answer to its most basic question: whether Boeing should make a brand-new design or revamp the 737 yet again.\n\nIn the face of the existential threat from the A320neo, Boeing\u2019s execs made up their minds in a matter of weeks. The company would launch a fourth-generation 737, and it would do it in record time.\n\nThe 737 Max was, plain and simple, a stopgap measure.\n\nBoeing could save billions of dollars in engineering costs by basing the Max off of the 737 platform. That gave the company a head start on design and engineering work \u2014 enough, Boeing hoped, to allow the Max to enter service just months after the A320neo.\n\nBut the project\u2019s engineers would have to overcome some monumental challenges in order to deliver on time. The first was the 737 platform itself. It would take a considerable amount of work to update a 46-year-old design with all of the technology it needed to be just as efficient as the competition.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit like, \u2018Ok pilots, good luck with that, figure it out.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 737 was conceived in the 1960s as what today we would call a regional jet, and with every variant, they\u2019ve pushed and pushed the thing to the end of its envelope,\u201d says Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and blogger at Ask the Pilot. \u201cIt makes you wonder if the platform that they\u2019re working with is just so outdated at this point.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the designers couldn\u2019t update it too much. By law, a pilot can only fly one type of airplane at a time. However, the Federal Aviation Administration allows different models of airplanes with similar design characteristics to share a common \u201ctype certificate.\u201d So, for instance, the 737\u2019s three previous generations all have a common type certificate. When you get qualified on one model, you can fly all of them.\n\nThis allows airlines with common-type fleets to more easily substitute pilots and airplanes, making their operations more flexible. As a result, many airlines limit themselves to aircraft from one manufacturer over the other. Some, like Ryanair and Southwest, only operate a single type of plane for maximum operational efficiency.\n\nIt also incentivizes manufacturers to design aircraft that will earn these common type certifications. But a type certificate is so detailed and comprehensive \u2014 covering everything from airplane dimensions to the configuration of the passenger cabin to the way the jet moves and feels in flight \u2014 that it can limit the amount of leeway designers have when trying to add a new model to an existing certificate.\n\nThe Max, for instance, not only had to be similar to the previous-generation 737NG, which first launched in 1993, but it also had to be similar enough to the 737 Classic from 1980 and the original 737 from 1964. In essence, it had to be a cutting-edge, 21st century airplane that still felt and flew like ones designed when The Beatles were still together.\n\nBoeing gave itself six years to do all of this \u2014 a year less than it took to develop the 777, and 18 months less than the 787. To beat Airbus, it would have to break the one unbreakable law of project management: that a development cycle can\u2019t be fast, cheap, and good. If it failed, Airbus could corner a $35 billion market for single-aisle airplanes for a decade or longer.\n\nSo Boeing could not afford to fail.\n\nEarly signs were encouraging. Two years into development, Boeing promised the Max would be 8 percent more fuel-efficient than the A320neo. Five and a half years in, the FAA granted the Max its Amended Type Certification. Just months later, the program\u2019s chief pilot, Ed Wilson, boasted that pilots rated on previous versions of the 737 could switch to the Max with just \u201c2 \u00bd hours of computer-based training.\u201d\n\nThis was another key selling point for airlines: no expensive classroom time, no costly simulator time. In theory, pilots could read about the Max at home, take a self-administered computer course in the morning, and be ready to fly in the afternoon.\n\nSo between its fuel and training efficiency, the Max seemed like a winning prospect for everyone \u2014 especially Boeing, which sold a record-breaking $200 billion worth of Maxes before the first prototype took to the skies.\n\nThe slick PR campaign masked a design and production process that was stretched to the breaking point.\n\nDesigners pushed out blueprints at double their normal pace, often sending incorrect or incomplete schematics to the factory floor. Software engineers had to settle for re-creating 40-year-old analog instruments in digital formats, rather than innovating and improving upon them. This was all done for the sake of keeping the Max within the constraints of its common type certificate.\n\nMCAS was designed to compensate\n\nAnd many pilots felt that, for the first new 737 in over 20 years, Boeing seemed to be oddly reluctant to prep them for it.\n\nCaptain Laura Einsetler, who\u2019s flown for over 30 years, including on 737s, considers an all-computer-based course to be completely inadequate as an introduction to a new airplane.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the schematics. I don\u2019t have the cockpit panels. I don\u2019t have an instructor that I can ask questions to,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re hoping that the first time you see the Max is on a nice clear day. But sometimes it\u2019s not, and you\u2019re showing up at night or in bad weather into an airplane that has all these changes.\u201d\n\nThere was something else Boeing hadn\u2019t mentioned about the 737 Max. Eight days after the Lion Air crash, a bulletin appeared on MyBoeingFleet, the company\u2019s online portal for pilots and airlines. It read:\n\n\u201cBoeing would like to call attention to an [Angle of Attack] failure condition that can occur during manual flight only.\u201d\n\nIn bland technical jargon, Boeing described the exact series of events that brought down PK-LQP. The confusing series of alerts. The sudden dives. The fact that this \u201cfailure condition\u201d would keep occurring until and unless the crew flipped the STAB TRIM switches to CUT OUT \u2014 just like the crew on PK-LQP\u2019s penultimate flight had correctly guessed.\n\nThe presence of this system, lurking somewhere in the Max\u2019s software suite, was shocking enough. Even more frightening, Boeing only gave the bare minimum of information to airlines and pilots. The bulletin didn\u2019t give the system a name or explain what it was designed to do in normal operation. It only said that sometimes it malfunctions, and that can crash your airplane.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit like, \u2018Ok pilots, good luck with that, figure it out,\u2019\u201d Einsetler says.\n\nFor four days, angry pilots and airline officials bombarded Boeing with demands for more information. Finally, on November 10th, another message appeared on MyBoeingFleet:\n\n\u201cBoeing has received many requests for the same information from 737 fleet operators,\u201d it read.\n\nAt last, Boeing admitted what the world had feared: something was fundamentally wrong with the brand-new 737 Max.\n\nThe culprit was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). Like the 737 Max, MCAS was made to be a stopgap.\n\nThe Max was designed around a new set of engines called LEAP-1Bs. These are much more efficient than the engines on the 737NG, but they are also much heavier and larger.\n\nThis created a design problem. The engines on the NG sit only 18 inches off the ground, and mounting the LEAP-1Bs in the same spot gave them too little clearance during takeoff. So Boeing placed them further forward and slightly higher on the wing of the Max.\n\nThat solution created an aerodynamics problem. Due to their size and position, the engines on the Max create lift when the airplane enters a steep climb (or, in aviation parlance, at high angles of attack). This extra lift causes the Max to handle differently than previous versions of the 737, but only when it\u2019s climbing steeply.\n\nBoeing announced new orders from multiple airlines, and it even managed to talk Lion Air out of canceling its $5 billion order\n\nThat solution created a regulatory problem. In order for different airplane models to share a type certificate, the FAA requires that they all handle the same way. A model of airplane with sensitive controls, like a sports car, can\u2019t share a type certificate with a model whose controls are much more sluggish, like a semi truck. Boeing was concerned that the FAA might consider this enough to give the Max its own type rating, undermining one of its promised selling points.\n\nThe right fix was not obvious, says Alex Fisher, a retired British Airways pilot who writes about flight safety. Because the problem only occurred in specific circumstances, Boeing couldn\u2019t just slap an extra set of fins on the airplane and call it a day. Aerodynamic changes \u201cwork\u201d all the time and require a lot of design and testing to get just right. Boeing needed something precisely targeted, carefully calibrated, and nonlinear in effect. It needed software.\n\nSo MCAS was designed to compensate. It would use an angle of attack (AoA) sensor to detect when the airplane entered a steep climb. It would activate the airplane\u2019s pitch trim system, which is routinely used to help stabilize the airplane and make it easier to control, especially during climb and descent. And it would trim the airplane in modest increments for up to nine seconds at a time until it detected that the airplane had returned to a normal AoA and ended its steep climb. It seems simple enough \u2014 on paper, that is.\n\nBoeing, meanwhile, defended its previous silence about MCAS.\n\n\u201cSince it operates in situations where the aircraft is under relatively high g load and near stall, a pilot should never see the operation of MCAS,\u201d read a Q&A distributed to Southwest Airlines.\n\nThe subtext: pilots were on a need-to-know basis about MCAS, and until the Lion Air crash, Boeing felt that they hadn\u2019t needed to know.\n\nEinsetler strongly disagrees. \u201cWe need to have the understanding and knowledge of how everything works on the jet, so that we can command the jet to do what we need it to do, not just be along for the ride,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of information got out there in a timely fashion,\u201d concurs Juan Browne, a 777 pilot with over 40 years of flying experience. \u201cIt almost makes me wonder, did Boeing engineers themselves really understand how much power and authority they built into this system?\u201d\n\nAs Boeing burned its bridges with pilots, it sought to repair ties with its primary customers: the airlines.\n\nWithin days of the Lion Air crash, Boeing deployed account reps around the world to shore up confidence in the Max. They succeeded: between November 2018 and March 2019, Boeing announced new orders from multiple airlines, and it even managed to talk Lion Air out of canceling its $5 billion order.\n\nThe Max continued to fly.\n\nThen, on March 10th, 2019, disaster struck again. ET-AVJ, another 737 Max 8 owned by Ethiopian Airlines, took off from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, bound for Nairobi, Kenya. In command was Yared Getachew, the airline\u2019s youngest-ever captain. On his right was Ahmed Nur Mohammed, a fairly new first officer.\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T SINK. DON\u2019T SINK.\u201d\n\nThe stick shaker on the left control column activated just after takeoff. The altitude and AoA indicators on one side of the airplane malfunctioned. About 90 seconds after takeoff, and immediately after the first officer retracted the flaps, the airplane dove unexpectedly.\n\nThe Ground Proximity Warning System sounded in the cockpit: \u201cDON\u2019T SINK. DON\u2019T SINK.\u201d\n\nInstinctively, Captain Getachew pulled his control column back to point the nose skyward, then flicked the electric trim switch on his yoke. First Officer Mohammed, meanwhile, radioed air traffic control.\n\n\u201cBreak, break, break,\u201d he said. \u201cRequest back to home. Request vector for landing.\u201d\n\nFive seconds later, MCAS activated again.\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T SINK. DON\u2019T SINK.\u201d\n\nCaptain Getachew again pulled up and again flicked the trim switch. But every time the pilots gained a few hundred feet of altitude, MCAS pushed the airplane right back down again.\n\nIt was Mohammed \u2014 the pilot whose experience was called \u201cabsurdly low\u201d by Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger himself \u2014 who correctly diagnosed the problem.\n\n\u201cStab trim cut-out, stab trim cut-out,\u201d he called. Getachew concurred, and Mohammed flipped the switches to disable MCAS.\n\nAt over 400 mph of airspeed, the airplane was already past its redline. The crew had just a few hundred feet of altitude to work with, and at that speed and altitude, the aerodynamic forces on the airplane would have been immense, making it difficult to control.\n\n\u201cPull up! Pull up!\u201d said Getachew, which they did, in unison, dozens of times over the next two minutes. The airplane barely responded. Mohammed tried to adjust trim with the manual crank located on the center console. That didn\u2019t work either.\n\nAlmost three minutes after turning the electric trim system off to disable MCAS, the crew reactivated it. They must have believed that it was the only way to get the airplane back into a climb.\n\nThe pilots trimmed up twice using their thumb switches, and then MCAS activated one final time. Fifteen seconds later, the airplane crashed at over 500 knots of airspeed into a field near the town of Bishoftu, Ethiopia. None of the 157 people aboard survived.\n\nThe reckoning had come for the 737 Max. By the next day, regulators around the world began to ground the airplane.\n\nThe United States didn\u2019t follow suit, however. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg reportedly called President Trump to assure him that the 737 Max was safe to fly.\n\nOn March 13th, the FAA grounded the airplane anyway. Muilenburg admitted that MCAS was directly responsible for both crashes and promised that Boeing would fix its broken system. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to eliminate this risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe own it and we know how to do it.\u201d\n\nBut why had nobody caught it in the first place? The answer might be infuriatingly simple: nobody read the paperwork.\n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between delegation and total submission\n\nAlthough the FAA is responsible for the safety of any airplane manufactured in the United States, it delegates much of the certification to the manufacturers themselves.\n\nIt has to in order to get anything certified at all, says Jon Ostrower, editor-in-chief of The Air Current and a former aviation reporter for The Wall Street Journal. Boeing already has the people and the expertise, it pays better, and it isn\u2019t susceptible to government shutdowns. The FAA, meanwhile, says it would need 10,000 more employees and an additional $1.8 billion of taxpayer money each year to bring certification entirely in-house.\n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between delegation and total submission.\n\nDuring the Max\u2019s certification process, FAA managers pressured their teams to delegate as much as possible back to Boeing. When Boeing looped the FAA back in for review, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a complete and proper review of the documents \u2026 review was rushed to reach certain certification dates,\u201d according to one FAA certification engineer.\n\nThe results of that rushed review are clear.\n\nWhenever it adds a new airplane to a type certificate, the FAA lists where that airplane does or does not differ from other models in the same type. In the case of the 737 Max, the FAA\u2019s list extends to 30 pages, reviewing everything from engine noise to de-icing systems, aluminum fatigue to security doors.\n\nYet this document dedicated to minutiae does not mention MCAS once \u2014 not by name, not by description \u2014 which is kind of astonishing when you consider that even the seat belts get a mention.\n\nThe FAA overlooked MCAS in other places, too.\n\nAs part of its certification review, the FAA assigns a \u201cfailure condition\u201d to each system, which is basically a guess as to what would happen if that system were to break. The lowest-severity systems should only cause \u201csome inconvenience\u201d to passengers, while the more serious \u201chazardous\u201d and \u201ccatastrophic\u201d failure conditions can endanger the aircraft and its passengers. The more severe the failure condition, the more redundancies that system is supposed to have.\n\nIt just believes whatever data it\u2019s given, even if that data is bad\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the theory. MCAS received a \u201chazardous failure\u201d designation. This meant that, in the FAA\u2019s judgment, any kind of MCAS malfunction would result in, at worst, \u201ca large reduction in safety margins\u201d or \u201cserious or fatal injury to a relatively small number of the occupants.\u201d Such systems, therefore, need at least two levels of redundancy, with a chance of failure less than 1 in 10 million.\n\nMCAS, however, does not meet any of these standards.\n\nIt has no redundancy: it takes input from just one AoA sensor at a time. That makes MCAS completely unable to cope with a sensor malfunction. It can\u2019t \u201csanity check\u201d its data against a second sensor or switch to a backup if the original source fails. It just believes whatever data it\u2019s given, even if that data is bad, which is what happened on Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302.\n\nIt gets worse: over the last five years, 50 flights on US commercial airplanes experienced AoA sensor issues, or about one failure for every 1.7 million commercial flight-hours. Sure, that\u2019s a low rate, but it\u2019s still nearly six times above what the FAA allows for \u201chazardous\u201d systems: they\u2019re only supposed to fail once every 10 million flight-hours.\n\nWorse still: the FAA did not catch the fact that the version of MCAS actually installed on the 737 Max was much more powerful than the version described in the design specifications. On paper, MCAS was only supposed to move the horizontal stabilizer 0.6 degrees at a time. In reality, it could move the stabilizer as much as 2.5 degrees at a time, making it significantly more powerful when forcing the nose of the airplane down.\n\n\u201cAlthough officials were aware of the changes,\u201d The New York Times reported, \u201cnone were fully examined by the FAA.\u201d\n\nSo had anyone checked, they might have flagged MCAS for one of several reasons, including its lack of redundancy, its unacceptably high risk of failure, or its significant increase in power to the point that it was no longer just a \u201chazardous failure\u201d kind of system.\n\nWhen asked for comment, the agency said, \u201cThe FAA\u2019s aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs.\u201d\n\nBoeing defended the process as well. \u201cThe system of authorized representatives \u2014 delegated authority \u2014 is a robust and effective way for the FAA to execute its oversight of safety,\u201d a spokesperson told The Verge.\n\nBut that system only works when someone actually reads the paperwork.\n\nIn a strange way, the 737 Max\u2019s story is less about what did happen and more about what didn\u2019t. Nobody did anything criminal. Nobody did anything malicious. Nobody did anything wrong, in a strictly technical sense.\n\nIn fact, when viewed in business terms, Boeing did everything right. Between 2011 when the Max was first announced and 2018, Boeing\u2019s total annual revenue grew almost 50 percent to $101 billion, its annual profits nearly doubled, and its stock price quadrupled. Its executives personally made tens of millions of dollars in bonuses for hitting their corporate performance targets, thanks, in large part, to the record-setting pace of 737 Max sales.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect example of the cross purposes at which business, technology, and safety often find themselves. With its bottom line threatened, Boeing focused on speed instead of rigor, cost-control instead of innovation, and efficiency instead of transparency. The FAA got caught up in Boeing\u2019s rush to get the Max into production, arguably failing to enforce its own safety regulations and missing a clear opportunity to prevent these two crashes.\n\nBoeing\u2019s bet on the 737 Max now seems to have been badly calculated. Since the two crashes, the company has lost over $25 billion in market cap. It may have to pay billions more to its suppliers and airline customers for costs related to the grounding, and that\u2019s not including the nearly $30 billion in orders that airlines have threatened to cancel. All this for an airplane whose initial development was supposed to be a great value at only $3 billion.\n\nIn Ethiopia, meanwhile, the consequences of Boeing\u2019s bet are much less abstract. A week of mourning followed the crash in Addis Ababa. Relatives of the victims flew in from Kenya, Canada, and China. Others who lived in Ethiopia were bused to the capital by the airline.\n\nThree days after the crash, hundreds of mourners and 17 empty caskets proceeded through the streets of Addis Ababa, ending at the Holy Trinity Cathedral.\n\nAt the crash site itself, relatives set up an arch wreathed in flowers as a memorial, under which they placed photographs of their loved ones. The airplane had struck the ground with so much force that there were no identifiable remains. Instead, families received bags of soil from the surrounding fields.\n\nCorrection: We\u2019ve updated our discussion of the failure rate of angle of attack sensors. It now refers to failures per total flight-hours rather than total flights, and only considers commercial passenger flights (not cargo or private flights) in its calculation.", "description": "The Verge spoke to a dozen pilots, instructors, engineers, and experts about the 737 Max and its development, rollout, and the two crashes that have claimed the lives of 346 people.
