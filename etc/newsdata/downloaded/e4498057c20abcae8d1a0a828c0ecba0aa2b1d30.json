Spokespeople for both Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot declined to comment on the report.\n\nGlobal automakers are facing a period of declining industrywide sales, because of a slowdown in China , the largest market for new car sales. Chinese sales declined about 11% in the most recent period, because of a slowing economy exacerbated by trade tensions with the United States.\n\nAutomakers are also facing pressure to develop expensive electric- and self-driving vehicles , a research and development effort that will cost billions of dollars but may not produce profits for years. Fiat Chrysler is trailing many of its competitors in those R&D efforts.\n\nFiat Chrysler was created out of a cross-border merger. Fiat started its purchase of Chrysler out of bankruptcy 10 years ago, a deal that was completed five years later.

GM lost about $22.4 billion in Europe over the 17 years before the deal, but Opel and Vauxhall are now profitable for PSA.\n\nFiat Chrysler, which is due to report third quarter results on Thursday, is likewise profitable.
