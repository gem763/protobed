The brand confirmed in a statement that they would wait for a \u201clater and more appropriate moment.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 cruise collection was originally staged in Paris earlier this year; it was the first collection designed without Karl Lagerfeld at the helm. The Hong Kong show was announced in July, when protests had already started. So it\u2019s not surprising that it was postponed. The brand told WWD on August 20, \u201cLike all brands present in Hong Kong, we are keeping a close watch on events, and have not yet made a decision.\u201d\n\nThe protests, which began as a reaction to an extradition bill, have drawn massive crowds. Protesters have torn down facial recognition cameras and briefly led to the cancellation of all flights leaving Hong Kong. Since the protests began in June and have shown no signs of slowing down, Chanel is probably right to wait for a better moment to stage a lavish fashion show. The collection will still be available in Hong Kong starting on November 6, though.", "description": "Chanel was originally supposed to stage a cruise 2020 show in Hong Kong but decided to postpone it indefinitely due to protests in the region.", "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/06/06-chanel-runway.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
