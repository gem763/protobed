It has empowered and interacted with corporate consolidation, including the devouring power of a Disney empire that is now literally disappearing classic movies from the theater circuit into its corporate vault. And it has habituated adult audiences to stories that belong \u2014 with, yes, exceptions \u2014 to the state of arrested development in which far more of Western culture than just Hollywood is trapped.\n\nI say \u201carrested development\u201d because a common critique of these movies is that they are childish or \u201cinfantilizing,\u201d to quote Bilge Ebiri\u2019s fine Vulture essay on the Scorsese contretemps. But that seems not quite apt: Children and their stories are much stranger and more interesting than the superhero industry, which sells a mix of grandiosity, moral certainty and performance anxiety (in the endless origin stories, especially) that belongs essentially to early adolescence.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ross Douthat", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Joker-Movie-Martin-Scorsese.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
