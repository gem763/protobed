Pyongyang has carried out six nuclear tests.\n\nIt claims, though this remains unverified, to have developed a nuclear bomb small enough for a long-range missile.\n\nIt also has a ballistic missile experts believe could reach the US.\n\nHow did talks begin?\n\nAfter months of escalating mutual threats, in January 2018 Mr Kim said he was \"open to dialogue\".\n\nMr Trump accepted, ignoring past pre-talk conditions that North Korea denuclearise first.\n\nOn 12 June 2018, Mr Trump became the first sitting president to meet a North Korean leader.\n\nThe two signed an agreement committing to the \"complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\" but with no detail on what that meant.\n\nBack to stalemate?\n\nSince then, there has been little progress. The US wants North Korea to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons while Pyongyang wants a step-by-step approach to ease the crippling sanctions regime.\n\nOn 28 February 2019, the two met for a second summit in Hanoi but talks broke down over North Korea demanding sanctions relief.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea carried out new weapons tests widely seen as an attempt to increase pressure on the US.\n\nOn 30 June, the leaders met again at the border between the two Koreas and Donald Trump briefly stepped into the North.\n\nBoth sides say they intend to continue talks.\n\nWant to know more?", "description": "At worst the saga has threatened nuclear war - it's complicated, but here are the basics.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2103/production/_97815480_041468865.jpg"}
