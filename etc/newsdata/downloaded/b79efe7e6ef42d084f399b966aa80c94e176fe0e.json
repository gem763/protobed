The fake media or me? Are you going to believe the Democrats, or are you going to believe me? Are you going to believe the rumor mill, the Beltway, or me in the transcripts?\u201d\n\nAsman went on to say it is a good strategy for Trump to go after the Washington Post because they \u201chave been caught several times with the news that did not turn out to be true.\u201d During his White House remarks, the president blasted the Post for first reporting that he pressed aides and officials to place a moat at the border \u201cstocked with snakes and alligators\u201d and that he told his staff to order soldiers to shoot migrants in the legs.\n\n\u201cThat is the Trumpian way right now,\u201d the Fox Business host said.\n\nThat story, however, first appeared in The New York Times, and is excerpted from an upcoming book by two of the paper\u2019s reporters.\n\n\u201cI think he feels he is winning,\u201d Asman noted later.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe sense is that he feels like he is winning. He thinks he has a jump on the media, that he has a jump on the Democrats by releasing the information that he has to show discrepancies and so forth, that is just my sense here. We were talking about his speech at the U.N., which was very low-key, and then he gave a presser after that Wednesday, and he did seem to be down. I think that he has regained his energy somewhat.\u201d\n\nAs for the president\u2019s claim that the report is \u201cfake news,\u201d Fox News\u2014along with several other outlets\u2014confirmed key aspects of the Times story.\n\n\u201cA source who was in the room at the time confirmed the conversation about shooting migrants in the legs to Fox News late Tuesday,\u201d the network noted in its report.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
