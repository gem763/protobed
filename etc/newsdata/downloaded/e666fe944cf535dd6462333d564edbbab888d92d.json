Both ISIS and its former parent organization, al-Qaeda, have published propaganda directed at Uyghurs, but ISIS has also produced Mandarin-language propaganda aimed at Han Chinese people.\n\nChina Daily acknowledged that al-Baghdadi\u2019s death \u2013 which President Trump attributed to a suicide bombing this weekend \u2013 was a \u201csignificant contribution\u201d against terrorism and lamented that it would improve Trump\u2019s approval ratings. It then went on to claim that America\u2019s \u201cdouble standard in fighting various groups of terrorists with different backgrounds has also hindered international cooperation and coordination against terrorism and done a disservice to the world community.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper accused Washington of being \u201cresponsible\u201d for the existence of the Islamic State, an oft-repeated myth by China\u2019s allies in Iran.\n\n\u201cOver the years, the Middle East has had to dance to the tunes of both US policy successes and failures in the region. True, the US has both contributed and made sacrifices in the fight against the IS group,\u201d China Daily claimed. \u201cBut its policy inconsistency and greed in pursuing its own interests in the region have also made it a disruptive force in the region. It was the destabilizing of the region by the US that was largely responsible for the rise of the IS and the establishing of its caliphate five years ago.\u201d\n\nThe editorial concluded with a demand that America \u201cplay a more constructive role in the region\u2019s peace and stability.\u201d\n\nChina currently has no troops stationed in Iraq or Syria; it recently established a permanent military presence in Djibouti, across the Red Sea from Yemen. China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure project based on the creation of state-of-the-art transportation hubs connecting Western Europe to Beijing, would cut directly through the former Islamic State \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\nChina Daily\u2019s criticism following al-Baghdadi\u2019s death echoed the chilly response the Chinese Foreign Ministry gave to the news.\n\n\u201cWe are following very closely the latest developments,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Monday. \u201cTerrorism is a common scourge for the international community. China is also a victim of it. We consistently oppose all forms of terrorism and take an active part in the global counter-terrorism cause.\u201d\n\nGeng did not say anything positive about al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, despite claiming China has been a victim of Islamic State terrorism. Instead, Geng used the opportunity to demand the world \u201cshould strengthen cooperation to jointly fight terrorism. It is our belief that both the symptoms and the root causes should be treated to eliminate the breeding ground for terrorism.\u201d\n\nChina has attempted to outsource its \u201canti-terrorism\u201d concentration camps to the world. In June, the Global Times, another state propaganda outlet, suggested that China could use the United Nations to promote the establishment of concentration camps and torture centers for Muslims worldwide.\n\nThe Global Times also weighed in on the al-Baghdadi death on Monday, claiming that \u201csome people are still questioning the veracity\u201d of the report (the Russian government claimed they had no evidence that proved al-Baghdadi was dead). It went on to accuse the United States of keeping the benefits of eradicating jihadis from other countries.\n\n\u201cThe war on terror has been going on for years. The US has claimed many of its achievements. Other parties either get nothing or suffer extra losses,\u201d the Global Times claimed. \u201cSince 2001, when the war on terror started, US soil has never been attacked by external terrorist forces. Its national security has been enhanced. But what about other countries and regions?\u201d\n\nThe United States has suffered multiple terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001, at the hands of jihadists. Among them are the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing at the hands of Chechen immigrants; the 2017 \u201ccar jihad\u201d attack in Manhattan by Uzbek radical Sayfullo Saipov; the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre by Islamic State terrorist Omar Mateen; and the 2015 San Bernardino jihadist massacre orchestrated by American Rizwan Farook and his Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik.\n\nThe Global Times also accused America of creating ISIS: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say the terrorist group is a result of the US war on terror and the Syrian civil war.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump announced on Sunday that army special forces had cornered al-Baghdadi outside of Idlib, Syria, near the Turkish border. Confronted by potential capture and transfer to U.S. custody, al-Baghdadi ran into a dead-end tunnel with three of his children and, trapped, detonated a suicide bomb vest, killing himself and the three children. Only one U.S. officer, a military dog, was injured in the operation.\n\n\u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast,\u201d Trump said, adding that he died \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Government-run\u00a0China Daily dismissed America as a \"disruptive force\" in the Middle East in response to the death of ISIS chief al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/2_Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
