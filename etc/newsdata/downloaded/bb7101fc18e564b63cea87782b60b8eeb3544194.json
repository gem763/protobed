It has dominated the political debate, paralyzed parliament, pitted Tory against Tory, Labour against Labour and threatened the integrity of the Union. Then late last month, it reached out and touched the queen.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II is the least politically assuming of any sovereign before her. Promoted in the line of succession by the abdication of her uncle, the 93-year-old monarch has spent her more than six decades on the throne cultivating a neutral and institutional role.\n\n\u201cThe queen\u2019s personal view is to stay out of politics,\u201d said Robert Lacey, a royal historian and historical consultant on Netflix series \u201cThe Crown.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s her nature to be shy. It\u2019s her nature not to intervene. She doesn't believe it\u2019s the constitutional monarch\u2019s role to make interventions, to change the rules or change things.\u201d\n\nBut when Boris Johnson \u2014 the 14th prime minister to serve under her reign \u2014 asked her to shut down parliament for four weeks, she couldn\u2019t avoid being dragged into the political fray.\n\nThe queen had little choice in the matter. Tradition dictates she grant the prime minister his requests. But with Johnson\u2019s move seen as an effort to prevent parliament from blocking a no-deal Brexit and the country so deeply divided between Leave and Remain, any answer she gave was bound to infuriate one side or the other.\n\nAnd some of the reaction was, indeed, furious.\n\n\u201cThe. Queen. Did. Not. Save. Us,\u201d tweeted Labour MP and former frontbencher Kate Osamor. Shortly afterwards she added: \u201cThe queen should look at what happened to her cousin Tino ex-King of Greece when you enable a right-wing coup! Monarchy abolished!\u201d\n\nA petition launched by the anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain asking the queen to refuse the request from Johnson quickly racked up more than 50,000 signatures, and the sovereign was soon fielding requests from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson to meet with them and hear their complaints about the decision.\n\n\u201cA lot of people half hoped that the queen would somehow come riding in on a stallion or one of her corgis to save the day,\u201d said Adam Wagner, a human rights lawyer and expert on constitutional law. \u201cBut the idea that the sovereign plays any substantial role in this farce is complete nonsense.\u201d\n\nMedieval trappings\n\nIn another political context, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s decision to follow with tradition and grant Johnson\u2019s request would have passed unremarked.\n\nWhile the monarchy retains much of its medieval trappings, its power has been in decline ever since King John signed the Magna Carta in 1215.\n\nAccording to protocol, the queen appoints the prime minister and accepts his or her resignation. She opens parliament almost every year with \u201cthe Queen\u2019s Speech,\u201d outlining the government\u2019s program. The arcane tradition sees her leave Buckingham Palace in a horse-drawn carriage and ride to the Houses of Parliament, escorted by the Household Cavalry.\n\nOnce there, she leads the Royal Procession through the House of Lords, wearing the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of State. An official to the Lords, known as Black Rod, goes to the Commons to summon members and take them to the Lords Chamber. When he reaches the door of the Commons it is shut in his face and he has to knock three times to gain entry \u2014 to symbolize the authority of the Commons over the Lords. The MPs file into the upper chamber and listen as the queen reads out the government program for that parliamentary session from a throne.\n\nBut formalities like these aside, the British monarchy has lost almost all of its real authority. The queen neither writes, nor necessarily agrees with the contents of, the Queen\u2019s Speech. The last monarch to dismiss a prime minister was King William IV, who sacked William Lamb in 1834. It did not go well for him. His chosen replacement, Robert Peel, could not command the confidence of the Commons and an election was called, which Lamb won.\n\nAnd the last time a British monarch refused to follow the advice of their government was in 1936 when King Edward VIII wanted to marry American socialite Wallace Simpson, said Robert Hazell, a professor of government and the constitution at University College London. Edward was forced to abdicate after holding the throne for just 12 months.\n\nThe monarchy\u2019s few remaining powers include \u201cthe right to claim ownership of any unmarked mute swan swimming in open waters,\u201d the titular ownership of any whales or porpoises swimming in British waters, and the right to drive without a license.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer acceptable for a modern monarch in a parliamentary democracy to have any political power,\u201d said Hazell, noting a similar decline of power in constitutional monarchies elsewhere in Europe.\n\n\u201cThey are all now in effect neutered monarchs in that they no longer exercise any real political power and they have all become much less assertive,\u201d he said.\n\nRule of law\n\nBecause the country has no written constitution, the queen's role in public life and what her ceremonial powers really mean exist in a grey area. A small number of people clearly thought Elizabeth could have \u2014 and maybe should have \u2014 refused Johnson's request to suspend parliament. But had she done so, it would have triggered a constitutional crisis.\n\nConstitutional experts have also been quizzed in recent weeks over whether the queen might have to intervene and dismiss the prime minister if Johnson lost a confidence vote but refused to resign. The Commons would have to give a clear signal that another candidate could command a majority in order for her to do so.\n\nSome Brexiteers have also suggested that the government neuter efforts by parliamentary rebels to delay Brexit by refusing to send their legislation for \"Royal Assent,\" the process by which the queen agrees to turn a bill into law. The process once required the monarch's signature, but it is now a quick formality that does not involve her directly.\n\nOne legal expert said the constitution would be thrown into \"crazy territory\" if the government tried to pull such a move.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that Johnson\u2019s maneuver \u2014 and the queen\u2019s involvement in it \u2014 has fueled calls for putting the constitution down on paper.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t run a country like this, we need a written constitution,\u201d said Conservative MP Rory Stewart. \u201cWe\u2019re only able to survive with an unwritten constitution because people behave, but as people push the limits more and more we need to clarify this stuff.\u201d\n\nLabour MP and shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis went a step further and called for a constitutional convention.\n\n\u201cWe have a political constitution that is barely fit for the 19th century, let alone the 20th or 21st,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s high time, once the dust has settled on Brexit, that this country really begins to understand that a democratic constitutional convention is necessary to work out what structure we are going to have for the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nOne of the key questions in any such venture would be the role of the monarch. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the appetite is for a republic but I think that should be on the agenda as something we should discuss,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nWhile few are calling for an end of the monarchy, the creation of a written constitution could curtail its powers for good.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, you could have a written constitution that puts the monarch as a purely titular head of state that does not even have the formal power that she has now,\u201d said Wagner, the human rights barrister and constitutional law expert. \u201cOr you write exactly what powers the monarch has into the constitution. You could also have a president, and the queen could be a figurehead rather than have any political role at all.\u201d\n\nAnthony Barnett, the author and co-founder of the OpenDemocracy website, argues that the informal checks and balances that used to work in the unwritten British constitution \u2014 of Cabinet, government and the civil service, among other things \u2014 have been broken by a succession of prime ministers eager to bend the rules in their favor.\n\nJohnson\u2019s involvement of the queen to close down parliament was just the latest example of many.\n\n\u201cWith our historic norms crumbling, even ardent monarchists will see that only a written constitution can preserve the decorative role of the crown while protecting the rest of us from prime ministers acting like absolutist kings or queens,\u201d he said.\n\nCharlie Cooper contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
