Firmino and Kane prove that being the right man in the right system is the true definition of quality.\n\nRoberto Firmino has been a major part of Liverpool's rise to the summit of European football\n\nHarry Kane is one of the deadliest finishes in the world and more of a typical centre forward\n\nHARRY KANE SUPERIOR THAN ROBERTO FIRMINO IN FRONT OF GOAL Firmino Games played: 116 Minutes played: 8,748 Goals: 46 Goal involvement: 76 Mins per goal: 190.17 Shot conversion rate: 17.23 Total shots: 267 Shots on target: 118 Games won: 74 Win ratio: 64% Kane Games played: 100 Minutes played: 8,369 Goals: 74 Goal involvements: 85 Mins per goal: 113.09 Shot conversion rate: 17.75 Total shots: 417 Shots on target: 180 Games won: 56 Win ratio: 56% *Stats in all competitions since start of 2017/18 season - provided by Opta\n\nWhen Firmino arrived at Anfield in the summer of 2015, Brendan Rodgers had reservations. Christian Benteke, a frequent tormentor of the Reds, was the manager's primary target as they chased a long-term replacement for Luis Suarez but Liverpool's transfer committee wanted the Brazilian.\n\nIn the end both were bought in but it was clear in his final few months as manager that Rodgers didn't rate Firmino as a sole striker. But, fast forward four years, his importance to Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool team cannot be overstated.\n\nHe is the heartbeat of their front three and the glue that links the attacking trident of Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Together they have led the club to Champions League glory and back into contention for the Premier League title.\n\nBut Firmino is hardly a typical striker. He is not physically imposing or particularly pacey, nor does he score 30 goals a season. In fact since the start of the 2017-18 campaign, when the Firmino, Mane and Salah trident was born, Firmino has scored 46 goals in all competitions, whereas Kane has 74.\n\nFirmino climbs above Marcos Alonso to score Liverpool's second goal in their win at Chelsea\n\nHarry Kane returned to goalscoring form with a brace against Red Star Belgrade in midweek\n\nIn fact Firmino scores a goal every 190.17 minutes, 77 minutes more than Kane who finds the back of the net ever 113.09 minutes.\n\nThe England captain is very much in the mould of a traditional centre forward. He operates inside the penalty box, lurks at the back posts for crosses and gobbles up any half chances that fall his way.\n\nIn his last five full seasons of first-team football Kane has scored 31, 28, 35, 41 and 24 goals across all competitions. Those numbers put him in the same bracket as European heavyweights Robert Lewandowski, Edinson Cavani and Mauro Icardi.\n\nSince August 2017, Kane has taken 417 shots in that period where Firmino has tried his luck 267 times. Kane's thirst for goals is never ending and that makes him one of the division's best forwards.\n\nBRAZILIAN GREATER CREATIVE FORCE THAN HIS RIVAL THOUGH Firmino Assists: 30 Chances created: 171 Big chances created: 43 Passes: 3,806 Passing accuracy: 76.85 Touches: 5,546 Touches in opposition's box: 621 Kane Assists: 11 Chances created: 103 Big chances created: 22 Passes: 1,812 Passing accuracy: 72.9 Touches: 3,502 Touches in opposition's box: 579 *Stats in all competitions since start of 2017/18 season - provided by Opta\n\nFirmino, meanwhile, is the perfect foil for those around him. He is more than happy to drop into midfield to allow Salah and Mane to come in off the flanks and make devastating runs in behind.\n\nHe'll happily take the ball with his back to goal, receive a pass, play another one and then dart into the box to try and get on the end of the cross. He is selfless and a critical component of Klopp's machine.\n\nFirmino's natural indication to supply rather than go for goal himself is reflected in the numbers. He has 30 assists in all competitions since the start of 17-18, 19 more than Kane, has created 68 more chances and 21 more 'big chances' for team-mates too.\n\nThe Brazilian has racked up almost 2,000 more passes during that same period and has accumulated 2,000 more touches of the ball than Kane, highlighting his role at the core of Liverpool's attack.\n\nFirmino produced a dazzling pass for Sadio Mane against Genk but the winger couldn't finish\n\nKane's performance in England's win over Spain a year ago shows there is more to his game\n\nFirmino also has 621 touches in the opposition's penalty area, compared to Kane's 579, and showcased everything that is good about his game in a split second in Belgium on Wednesday.\n\nWith the Reds looking for a first Champions League group-stage win away from home since 2017 and already 1-0 up at Genk, Firmino received the ball on the edge of the box and produced an outrageous rabona pass into the path of Mane.\n\nThe winger missed when he should have scored but that passage of play highlights exactly what Liverpool fans love about Firmino and why he is invaluable.\n\nKane's numbers make it easy for him to be written off as greedy and unable to see the bigger picture. Let's not forget that he is technically sublime as well, with a range of passing that Sergio Busquets would appreciate.\n\nThe way England tore Spain apart in Seville last year was impressive and Kane was key to it. He linked up with Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford like Firmino does with Salah and Mane, holding off Sergio Ramos to control a goal kick before swivelling and laying the ball on a plate for Rashford to convert the second that night.\n\nFIRMINO ALSO BETTER THAN KANE OFF THE BALL TOO Firmino Possession won in the final 1/3: 90 Tackles: 148 Tackle success: 75% Interceptions: 35 Recoveries: 392 Duel success: 36.64% Kane Possession won in the final 1/3: 69 Tackles: 44 Tackle success: 65.91% Interceptions: 13 Recoveries: 206 Duel success: 42.47% *Stats in all competitions since start of 2017/18 season - provided by Opta\n\nThere is certainly more to Kane's game than just goals, something he doesn't get enough credit for, but if there is one area that Firmino surpasses his rival it is defensively.\n\nHis work off the ball is just as important to Klopp's style as on it and sums up his very un-Brazilian skill set. Liverpool's pressing intensity may have reduced slightly since the start of last season but that has led to more efficient and coordinated pressure.\n\nThe Reds have conceded seven goals in nine league games so far this season, the joint-lowest with Sheffield United, and Firmino is the catalyst for their defensive effort.\n\nSpurs, in contrast, have let in 13 goals in nine matches over the course of an underwhelming start to the season and Kane's defensive numbers are vastly inferior to Firmino's.\n\nKane doesn't frequently regain possession for Tottenham like Firmino does for Liverpool\n\nThe Brazilian has 100 more tackles and 22 more interceptions than the Tottenham striker\n\nRegularly launching the press from the edge of the opponent's penalty box, Firmino has won possession in the final third of the pitch 90 times since the start of 17-18, which is 21 times more than Kane.\n\nHe has also made 104 more tackles than the Spurs ace, winning 75 per cent of those compared to Kane's 65.91 per cent. Firmino boasts 22 more interceptions than Kane and has recovered the ball 186 times more than the Englishman.\n\nKane's efforts in both directions will be desperately needed if Spurs are to get anything from Anfield on Sunday. He has been involved in seven goals in nine league appearances against Liverpool, scoring five and setting up two but drew a blank in both matches last season.\n\nFirmino, meanwhile, scored the opener in the victory over Spurs at Anfield last season and another fascinating battle awaits between two of the Premier League's best, but very opposite, star names.", "description": "THE NUMBERS GAME - MAX WINTERS: Tottenham's trip to Liverpool promises to be a fascinating battle, not least because of the vastly different styles of the strikers on show at Anfield.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/12/20176682-0-image-a-12_1572002316473.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
