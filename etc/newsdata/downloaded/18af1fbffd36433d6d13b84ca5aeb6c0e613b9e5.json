CNBC reports some donors are even talking about sitting the next election out if Warren is the nominee:\n\nDemocratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle \u2014 or even back President Donald Trump \u2014 if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party\u2019s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. \u201cYou\u2019re in a box because you\u2019re a Democrat and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018I want to help the party, but she\u2019s going to hurt me, so I\u2019m going to help President Trump,\u2019\u201d said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders\u2026 \u201cThey will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry,\u201d an executive at one of the nation\u2019s largest banks told CNBC, also speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nWarren seems to be reveling in all of this. Earlier this month she reacted to a discussion about Wall Street\u2019s fears of her possible presidency by saying she endorsed the message.\n\nI'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message. https://t.co/2Ewkbm0ZwA \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 10, 2019\n\nPortraying herself as Wall Streets\u2019 boogeyman will certainly appeal to a certain segment of the Democratic Party. The problem with this is that campaigns do run on money and not just presidential campaigns. The DNC has been struggling to raise cash for months. While the RNC raised more than $20 million in June and again in July, the DNC raised just over $16 million in those two months combined. In August, the RNC set a fundraising record for this year bringing in $23.5 million while the DNC raised just under $8 million (and the DNC spent more than it raised last month).\n\nSelecting Warren as the nominee may present a real challenge to turning those numbers around. Warren is set to host a major DNC fundraiser next month, so we\u2019ll get a chance to find out if she can rake in big money despite turning off some of the party\u2019s biggest donors.\n\nHere\u2019s Warren trying to define a difference between capitalism which she says she supports and \u201ctheft.\u201d", "description": "\"...she\u2019s going to hurt me, so I\u2019m going to help President Trump.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Elizabeth-Warren.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
