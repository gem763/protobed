(HBO Max is not a person, sadly. It\u2019s a new streaming service from Warner Media slated to debut in 2020. It\u2019s more fun to read things about it, though, if you imagine it\u2019s a singular dude named Max. Max and Ellen, hanging out! See? Fun!) DeGeneres\u2019s deal includes three straight-to-series shows \u2060\u2014 a design show, a dating show, and a children\u2019s show \u2060\u2014 and one docuseries still in the works. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to bring my new shows to HBO Max. I don\u2019t know who Max is, but I can\u2019t wait to work with him,\u201d DeGeneres said in statement. (I swear I also made this joke before getting that far into the press release. Ellen, let\u2019s hang.)\n\nHBO Max has been announcing new projects and collecting shows for weeks now. It\u2019s got a Practical Magic prequel in the works. It\u2019s getting The Big Bang Theory, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. It\u2019s also picking up Friends, which is leaving Netflix. And, now, it\u2019s got Ellen.\n\nIn Ellen\u2019s Home Design Challenge, \u201cdesign aficionado DeGeneres is giving eight forward-thinking designers the chance to push their creativity to the limit.\u201d Her children\u2019s program, Little Ellen, is a \u201c2-D animated children\u2019s show that explores the world through the eyes of a hilarious and unpredictable seven-year-old Ellen DeGeneres.\u201d The show is set in her hometown of New Orleans. First Dates Hotel will see Ellen playing matchmaker. (The show is based on an existing U.K. dating series by the same name.) She\u2019s also signed on for Finding Einstein, a docu-series \u201cthat will seek out, celebrate and support a fresh generation of Einsteins.\u201d HBO Max says it has the Einstein family \u201cstamp of approval.\u201d\n\nHello, yes. HBO Max? While you\u2019re on the hunt for geniuses, I\u2019d like to let you know my DMs are open. You saw my Max joke. Brilliant stuff.", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres announced a deal with HBO Max, a new streaming service from WarnerMedia.
