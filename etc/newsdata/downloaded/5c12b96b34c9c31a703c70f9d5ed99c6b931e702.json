And this Nintendo Switch remake captures every inch of it with a gorgeous toy-like, top-down makeover. There\u2019s a compact overworld packed with enemies for Link to slay, distractions to enjoy and colourful characters to meet, help and chuck pots around their house. A tight selection of inventive dungeons, each challenging you with constrictions until you find their key item that blows it wide open.\n\nBut it also moves the action away from Hyrule to the dreamy Koholint Island, where everything feels slightly\u2026 off. Characters usually found in Super Mario Bros. roam the island, Bow-Wows kept as pets, Goombas prowling underground, Shy Guys found in dungeons, a mysterious photo of Princess Peach. No Ganon to fight or Zelda to aid, but a Wind Fish to wake, sat atop a mountain inside a giant egg.\n\nSure, why not? Koholint is a terrific place and in design terms it is work of economical wonder. While its relatively small size would have been based on the Game Boy\u2019s constraints, its richness shines even in 2019.", "description": "The Legend of Zelda has always had its delightful idiosyncracies --aggressive chickens, sultry fairies, Tingle-- but 1993 Game Boy adventure Link\u2019s Awakening has always been one of the most curious.", "authors": ["Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gaming/2019/09/27/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqfqW6igm2KYus3Tnvc1kUsHGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
