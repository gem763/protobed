Now How About Selling Them\n\n(Bloomberg) -- It only took a decade for traditional automakers to take electric cars seriously and offer more than a smattering of test-the-water models.\n\nNow comes the hard part: Getting consumers to buy them.\n\nAt Frankfurt\u2019s 2019 car show, Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess laid it on thick, calling on governments to give up coal-fired power as he unveiled the electric ID.3 car-for-the-masses. At the Mercedes-Benz stand, where the Daimler AG brand was showing the prototype of an electric S-Class sibling, real beech trees framed massive screens displaying schools of digital fish.\n\nThe message to environmentally conscious consumers: we\u2019re with you. But a marketing blitz alone won\u2019t wash away the deep uncertainties facing electric cars -- obstacles little changed since carmakers\u2019 initial forays with models like the Nissan Leaf and BMW AG i3. Customers don\u2019t like paying up for new technology they\u2019re unsure about, and they\u2019re worried they won\u2019t reliably get to where they want to go.\n\n\u201cThe next big thing is not going to be about the cars, because they will come,\u201d Carlos Tavares, president of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association and CEO of Groupe PSA, said Wednesday. \u201cThe next big thing is about affordable mobility. The next big thing is about how we make this work for the biggest number of people.\u201d\n\nSo far, electric cars have only proliferated in countries with significant sweeteners. Once they go, sales of battery models crater. Demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest electric car market, fell 16% in August -- its second straight decline -- after the government scaled back subsidies. Carmakers can reduce prices, but then only cut into profitability that in most cases has been nonexistent.\n\nConsumers are similarly sensitive elsewhere. Demand in Denmark collapsed when the government phased out tax breaks in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about EVs for years, but this year the real production cars showed up,\u201d Max Warburton, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note. \u201cShould we be celebrating these cars, given the poor margins that most will have?\u201d\n\nAcross Europe, sales of new plug-in hybrids and fully-electric cars last year made up 2% of total registrations. That\u2019s a tiny market to tussle over for the likes of VW\u2019s ID.3, with a price point below 30,000 euros ($33,009), Tesla Inc.\u2019s Model 3 and Mercedes\u2019s gleaming lineup of plug-ins. Yet carmakers have little choice but to boost their offering to keep pace with regulation, or face fines.\n\nConsumer demand \u201ccan\u2019t be mandated,\u201d Daimler CEO Ola Kallenius said at the show. Mercedes-Benz is adding at least 10 purely battery-powered cars through 2022 at a cost of more than 10 billion euros, starting with last year\u2019s EQC SUV, so the carmaker\u2019s lineup can to meet stricter emission limits.\n\nA lot of factors are moving in the right direction. The ID.3\u2019s price point and basic range of 330 kilometers (205 miles) sets the car apart from previous efforts that needed meticulous pre-planning for longer trips. At the top end, there\u2019s now the $185,000 Porsche Taycan Turbo S, and a mid-range that\u2019s rapidly filling out from SUVs like the Jaguar I-Pace and Audi e-tron.\n\nPatchy charging infrastructure is improving too. Ionity, a consortium of Daimler, VW, Ford Motor Co., BMW and now Hyundai Motor Co., is on track to finish building a network of 400 European fast-charging stations by next year to make long-distance travel easier.\n\nLean Years\n\nFor carmakers, this will mean some lean years -- at least to 2025 when battery prices are expected to come down -- during which lucrative conventional SUVs must subsidize poor returns from their electric cousins. VW will need \u201cpatience\u201d until the ID.3 brings significant profit \u201cjoy,\u201d Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said.\n\nTo bridge the gap, the industry is lobbying hard for governments to step up incentives to get to the oft-cited tipping point where driving without a combustion engine becomes normal. In Germany, home to VW, Mercedes and BMW as well as world-leading suppliers like Continental AG, the government sits down next week to discuss broad climate measures. Carmakers are hoping for a bigger slice of subsidies than they got so far.\n\nThe ACEA on Wednesday called on national governments to boost charging points in Europe to 2.8 million by 2030, a 20-fold increase from 2018.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- It only took a decade for traditional automakers to take electric cars seriously and offer more than a smattering of test-the-water models.Now comes the hard part: Getting consumers to buy them.At Frankfurt\u2019s 2019 car show, Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess laid it on", "authors": ["Oliver Sachgau", "Christoph Rauwald"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.GVnjYhI5i88wYiFl5K.tw--~B/aD03NzI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/f49b20a388f460204300dedb2247c952"}
