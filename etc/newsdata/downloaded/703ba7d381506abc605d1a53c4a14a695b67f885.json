It was full of proverbs, one of which really spoke to me \u2014 'The heart has no rainbow if the eyes have no tears.'\n\nLater on, I came across a favourite Buddhist saying: 'You don't know life until you know pain.'\n\nBoth quotations showed me that we're not meant to live our lives in a constant state of happiness. Without the sorrow, you wouldn't appreciate the joy.\n\nSinger Lee Ryan has shared how life has taught him that it is important to have the lows in order to savour the highs\n\nIn other words, you've got to have the lows to savour the highs. And you don't learn from being happy; you learn from being sad.\n\nSimilarly, it's OK to fail if you learn the lessons failure teaches you. I don't have any regrets about the mistakes I've made because they've shown me that something good can come out of something bad.\n\nFor example, in Blue's heyday, I didn't pay attention to financial matters, preferring to listen to other people who took advantage of me. [The band's company, Blueworld Ltd, went into liquidation in 2013; two years later Lee declared himself bankrupt].\n\nI blame myself for that careless attitude; a legacy from my school years when I thought I knew it all. I'm much more astute these days.\n\nThe pop star added that we are not to live our lives in a constant state of happiness as witout sorrow you wouldn't appreciate the joy. (File photo)\n\nThen I shouldn't have lost the family life I had with my ex-fiance, Sammi, and our little boy, Rayn. He's ten now and we're really close again. But I neglected the relationship so it's only relatively recently that he's been able to see functioning co-parenting, something my mum and dad never achieved. [They split when Lee was six.]\n\nI don't know if I'll settle down for a long time. I love the early months of a relationship and then I start concentrating on my career again.\n\nI also have a daughter, Bluebell, who's 11. These are key ages for my kids so I'm working as hard as I know how to make memories with each of them that will last. They're my priority for the next few years.\n\nRipItUpTheShow.com", "description": "Singer Lee Ryan has shared how life has taught him that it is important to have the lows in order to savour the highs.", "authors": ["Richard Barber For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19965360-0-image-a-12_1571603945087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
