Asked whether that would include the Dongfeng 41, he said: \u201dPlease wait and see.\u201d\n\nThe ability to project power is increasingly urgent for Chinese leaders who want to control shipping lanes and waters also claimed by Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and other governments.\n\n\u201cChina has developed nuclear, space, cyberspace and other capabilities that can reach potential adversaries across the globe,\u201d the US Defence Intelligence Agency said in a report in January.\n\nLast year\u2019s spending on the PLA rose 5 per cent to $250bn (\u00a3228bn), or about 10 times its 1994 level, according to Sipri. The United States, with a force of 1.3 million, was far ahead at $650bn, or more than twice China\u2019s level.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Air defence missiles might show Beijing is preparing for war with the United States or another advanced opponent.\n\nAnalysts want to know about Chinese software, electronics and wireless control networks, said Mr Wezeman.\n\n\u201cTen vehicles full of antennas may give an indication that is something that is becoming more important for China,\u201d he said.\n\nIf mobile launchers for nuclear missiles are displayed, that might help to shed light on how Beijing sees \u201cthe challenge of maintaining credibility with their nuclear deterrent\u201d, Mr Boyd added.\n\nChina has about 280 nuclear warheads, compared with 6,450 for the United States and 6,850 for Russia, according to Sipri. Beijing says it wants a \u201cminimum credible nuclear deterrent\u201d but will not be the first to use atomic weapons in a conflict.\n\nMobile launchers \u201cwould make it more difficult for any potential enemy to do a first strike,\u201d said Mr Boyd.\n\nSatellite photos show China is increasing the number of launchers for DF-41 and DF-31 missiles from 18 to as many as 36, Mr Boyd said.\n\nThat suggests planners believe that minimum nuclear force \u201cneeds to be larger\u201d, he said. \u201cIt needs to have more advanced systems with MIRV capability to remain credible, in their eyes.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press", "description": "A parade\u00a0by\u00a0China\u2019s secretive military will offer a rare look at its rapidly developing arsenal, including possibly a nuclear-armed missile that could reach the United States in 30 minutes, as Beijing gets closer to matching Washington and other powers in weapons technology. The Dongfeng 41 is one of a series of new weapons Chinese media say might be unveiled during the parade", "authors": ["Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/29/09/china-weapon-parade.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
