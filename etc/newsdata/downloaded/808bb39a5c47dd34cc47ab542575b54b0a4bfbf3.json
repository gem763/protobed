Mastrocinque's translation is published in the book Studies in Honour of Roger S.O. Tomlin .\n\nThe tablet is thought to date back to the sixth century, a time when the Byzantine Empire controlled the city.\n\nWhile Christianity was the official religion of the Byzantine Empire, that didn't stop the use of curse tablets naming Thoth and other \"pagan\" gods.\n\n\"This [curse tablet] ... confirms that the Christianisation of the Roman Empire did not stop the maleficent magical arts,\" Mastrocinque wrote.\n\n\"On the contrary, these increasingly spread and became more sophisticated.\"\n\nThe tablet is now in the Archaeological Museum of Milan.", "description": "The curse calls upon various demons to inflict harm on a dancer named Manna", "authors": ["Sophie Curtis", "Image", "Attilio Mastrocinque", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543837.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Attilio-Mastrocinque.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
