And the Denver Nuggets.\n\nBol, the No. 44 pick in the most recent draft and the son of former NBA player Manute Bol, will sign a two-way contract for the coming season, reports Shams Charania of The Athletic.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDenver Nuggets\u2018 No. 44 pick Bol Bol has signed his rookie contract, a two-way NBA deal, league sources tell @TheAthleticNBA @Stadium. \u2014 Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) September 4, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good fit because Bol has potential but also is raw and is going to need time in the G-League to get his body right and acclimate to the NBA-style game. Denver is a good development team and is taking this at the right pace.\n\nBol\u2019s potential is not in question: He\u2019s a 7\u20193\u2033 big man who averaged 21 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 2.7 blocked shots a game at Oregon last season, and he\u2019s as good a three-point as maybe anyone in this past draft class.\n\nSo why did a guy with lottery skills drop to 44th in the draft? He only played nine games at Oregon due to a Navicular bone fracture in his left foot \u2014 big men with foot issues worry teams (he didn\u2019t play in Summer League in part to make sure he was fully recovered). More concerning, there are questions about how much he actually loves the game and will be willing to put in the work it would take to become a valuable NBA player.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s what Bol can prove in the G-League \u2014 that he\u2019s got the drive and work ethic. He\u2019s got to get stronger and be better at defensive recognition (although his length covers up a lot of mistakes), but it\u2019s all within his reach. He\u2019s just got to want it.\n\nDenver made a smart move trading to draft for Bol in the middle of the second round, by that point there was little risk. Now giving him a two-way contract is the right move. The Nuggets have handled this well and the front office there is reportedly confident he can make the leap up to the NBA. Now it\u2019s on Bol to reward that faith.", "description": "This is the perfect contract for Bol Bol.
