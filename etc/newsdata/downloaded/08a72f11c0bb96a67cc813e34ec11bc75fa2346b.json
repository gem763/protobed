The documentary highlighted what it saw as misconduct by the then-government of Park Geun-hye.\n\nThe festival was told to withdraw the film but kept it on the programme and then faced budget cuts and criminal charges filed against senior management. The matter was only really resolved with the arrival of the government of Moon Jae-in in 2017.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Film brings us together\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cWhen Busan was under political suppression many international film people showed their support and I was one of them,\u201d said Kore-eda.\n\n\u201cNow, after all those years of difficulty Busan has been able to come this far. That\u2019s why I am able to visit this day. Back then solidarity with Busan showed it could endure through the problems it was having with politics. And I hope we can do the same today.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old BIFF has long championed Kore-eda\u2019s work and the filmmaker believes this helped people from the two nations understand more about each other over the years.\n\n\u201cFilm brings us together and reveals things about each other that we all share,\u201d said Kore-eda who sent a video message to BIFF on opening night before arriving in Busan early Saturday.\n\nThe 57-year-old won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or last year for his family drama \u201cShoplifters\u201d, a cutting look at a family living on the edges of Japanese society.\n\nHe has returned to BIFF this year with the family drama \u201cThe Truth\u201d, his first non-Japanese feature. It stars iconic French actresses Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binoche and swirls around a emotional family reunion and the publishing of an error-strewn memoir. Hollywood A-lister Ethan Hawke also features as the son-in-law.\n\n\u201cThis process of working overseas with overseas actors was very different for me,\u201d said Kore-eda. \u201cBut I think people all over the world are interested in the same types of stories.\u201d\n\nBIFF runs until October 13.", "description": "Busan (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Cannes Palme d\u2019Or-winning Japanese director Hirokazu\u00a0Kore-eda says he has come to South Korea to show", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/8fcad5_japan-hirokazu-kore-eda-shoplifters-won-palme-or-year-arrived-busan-international-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
