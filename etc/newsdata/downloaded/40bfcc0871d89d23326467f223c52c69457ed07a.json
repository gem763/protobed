It\u2019s now made good nearly all the losses incurred since President Donald Trump\u2019s fateful tweet at the start of August which triggered a round of tit-for-tat escalations of the trade war.\n\nBy the same token, the German DAX was up 0.1%, also at its highest since early August, while the FTSE 100 was unchanged.\n\nLuxury names outperformed on more signs of a potential de-escalation of the protest in Hong Kong, which accounts for a disproportional amount of sales and profit at groups such as Burberry and Gucci owner Kering.\n\nElsewhere, all was becalmed, with another set of gloomy German industrial production data keeping any optimism firmly in check. With incoming orders to German factories also falling in July, the first \u201chard\u201d data of the third quarter from Europe\u2019s largest economy have pointed clearly to a second straight quarter of contraction in the summer.\n\n\u201cSince reunification there have been four comparable industrial setbacks of which three ended in a recession,\u201d Allianz economist Katharina Utermoehl said via Twitter. However, she pointed to one key difference with the last recession in 2008/9, which is that the addition of 6 million jobs to the German economy in the last decade has left consumption structurally stronger.\n\nWith no turnaround in sight in the euro zone economy (second-quarter GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2% on Friday), much is now resting on the outcome of the European Central Bank\u2019s policy meeting next week.\n\n\u201cEven if (the German data) come too late to be incorporated into next week\u2019s official ECB forecasts, it will be another argument for ECB members in favor of new monetary stimulus,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski.\n\nMost analysts expect the ECB to cut its discount rate by 0.1% or 0.2%, and to adjust the price of its new long-term loans to as to keep short-term interest rates anchored lower. The big open question is whether it will renew its purchases of bonds, given that a vocal minority of central bankers from Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have all voiced resistance to the idea in the last week.", "description": "StockBeat: Weak German Data Cool Optimism Ahead of U.S. Jobs Report", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEEAC0LE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
