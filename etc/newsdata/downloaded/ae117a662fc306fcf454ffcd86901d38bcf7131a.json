This would have been a very, very interesting trial to preside over,\u201d he told the court.\n\nAlthough the deal involved only Cuyahoba and Summit counties of Ohio, it stands as a possible a bellwether for states, cities, counties and Native American communities around the country.\n\nThey ultimately could win more than the $18 billion in cash and $30 billion of in-kind payments that plaintiffs rejected in negotiations Friday.\n\n\u201cThe proposed settlement will make significant progress to abate the epidemic by providing resources for and applying funds directly to necessary opioid-recovery programs,\u201d lawyers for the plaintiffs in the national class action suit said.\n\n\u2013 Not a global settlement \u2013\n\nThey noted that the deal announced Monday was not a \u201cglobal settlement\u201d and that the broader lawsuit representing 2,700 communities would continue to move forward.\n\nJohnson & Johnson had previously broken away with its own settlement, a $20.4 million deal with the two Ohio counties, which encompass the cities of Cleveland and Akron.\n\nThat came after Johnson & Johnson was ordered in August to pay $572 million to compensate Oklahoma state for the costs of dealing with the addiction crisis.\n\nPolster, the judge presiding over the case, had pressured all sides for months to come to a deal to avoid a grinding, lengthy trial.\n\nBut the parties could not come to an agreement on a proposed settlement valued at $48 billion, including $18 billion in cash, after meetings on Friday.\n\nFour states involved in the litigation were in support.\n\nBut other states and many smaller litigants were dissatisfied with the amount, the size of the cash component, lawyers\u2019 fees and the way the money would be distributed.\n\n\u201cEvery expert who has looked at this issue believes our country will be dealing with the fallout from this class of drugs for many years,\u201d Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said in a statement last week.\n\n\u201cAny recovery must be directed toward solving the problem, and not diverted to other uses.\u201d\n\nThe proposed settlement amount would be only a fraction of the overall cost.\n\nA study released this week estimated that the opioid epidemic cost the US economy at least $631 billion from 2015 to 2018.\n\nThe Society of Actuaries report projects that for this year alone the cost could be $172-214 billion.\n\nNearly one-third of the 2015-2018 costs was in health care spending for addicts and infants born to addicts.\n\nSome 40 percent was for the costs of early deaths, and the rest was for child and family care programs, criminal justice and lost productivity.\n\nCommunities say they are already under heavy financial pressure, and don\u2019t want to spend years fighting in court \u2014 giving the drugmakers and distributors some leverage.", "description": "Cleveland (AFP) \u2013 Three leading drug distributors and an Israeli drugmaker blamed for a deadly US opioid epidemic settled with plaintiffs Monday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/356a12_lawsuit-drug-distributors-drugmaker-resulted-in-260-million-pre-trial-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
