And your options (unless you want to reattach that cable box) are limited. You can buy a separate antenna in order to access these stations, but your reception may be limited by how strong the signals are and whether they are blocked by nearby structures. So what do you do?\n\nThere is currently at least one service that is trying to fill the gap. Locast is a relatively recent streaming service that offers access to local broadcasting. Currently, it covers nine cities: New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Denver, and Washington, DC.\n\nAs a New Yorker who abandoned cable some months ago, I was curious how Locast worked\n\nAs a New Yorker who abandoned cable some months ago, I have to admit that I was curious how Locast worked and what it would give me access to. In New York City, Locast makes 17 local stations available, including local outlets for major networks (CBS, NBC, FOX, ABC, PBS), and not-so-major local stations (WWOR, WPIX, and several other English- and Spanish-language stations).\n\nQuick and easy \u2014 and irritating\n\nLocast\u2019s sign-up process is not at all difficult: I just clicked on the city I live in, and then registered with an email and password. (You can also sign up through Facebook.) The site required that I enable geolocation; Locast doesn\u2019t let viewers access any stations outside their designated market area.\n\nAfter that, I was given access to a fairly standard programming grid with the stations presented in channel order. I clicked on the one I wanted to view, and was immediately watching the show that was currently running. Locast is accessible via a variety of formats: I viewed it via the web from a desktop computer, on a Roku-enabled TV, and using the Android app (there is also an iOS app). The interface and service were pretty much identical on each, and the quality of the stream was reasonable \u2014 I didn\u2019t see any stuttering or pauses.\n\nHow can Locast do this? Unlike Aereo, a commercial service which provided local programming until it was shot down by the Supreme Court in 2014, Locast has registered as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit advocacy group (under the auspices of the Sports Fan Coalition). According to its FAQ, since it doesn\u2019t get any \u201cdirect or indirect commercial advantage\u201d from the transmissions, it has the right to broadcast local stations.\n\nThe FAQ also cites Locast\u2019s ability to charge a fee \u201cnecessary to defray the actual and reasonable costs\u201d of providing the service. Technically, Locast doesn\u2019t charge a fee \u2014 it asks for contributions of at least $5 per month. You do have the choice of not paying that \u201ccontribution\u201d \u2014 but if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll find Locast\u2019s broadcasts practically unwatchable.\n\nWhy? Because every 15 minutes, the broadcast is interrupted by a request for the membership contribution. Actually, the broadcast isn\u2019t just interrupted \u2014 it\u2019s completely stopped. After the plea for money is over, you aren\u2019t returned to your program, but bounced back to the programming grid. If you want to continue to watch your show, you have to click on it again \u2014 and say goodbye to any dialogue you may have missed in the meantime. (While I didn\u2019t pony up the $5 requested, judging from user comments for the Android app, members do get to watch shows uninterrupted.)\n\nEvery 15 minutes, the broadcast is interrupted for a request for the membership contribution\n\nIf you do choose to donate, you can pay either via credit card, PayPal, or bitcoin. I could find no information on the site about how to cancel a subscription, and the only obvious way to contact the company was through an online form. So if you\u2019ve agreed to a monthly payment and then later change your mind, you can try the form, but if you\u2019re in a hurry, you may need to cancel by stopping payment on your card services.\n\nWatching TV \u2014 the old-fashioned way\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind: Locast doesn\u2019t have any type of recording feature. In fact, watching Locast is a bit like watching TV before VCRs were invented: if there\u2019s a program you want to catch, you\u2019ve got to turn it on when it\u2019s playing. And if you need a bathroom break, wait for the commercial \u2014 you can\u2019t pause the stream either. (Of course, you can always record your screen using a separate app and play it back later.)\n\nIt will be interesting to find out what happens to Locast \u2014 not only as a service, but as a company that is currently under the radar of those networks that took such exception to Aereo. (I sent a message to the company asking if they had any legal challenges on the horizon, but haven\u2019t yet heard back.) If enough viewers see it as worthy of a $5 per month subscription (since it is essentially unwatchable otherwise), and if the courts view that as a necessary fee, then Locast may be around for a while.", "description": "Locast is a relatively recent streaming service that offers access to local broadcasting in several cities.
