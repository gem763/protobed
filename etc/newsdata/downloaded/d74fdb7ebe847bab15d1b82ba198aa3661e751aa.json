Both have displayed the award-winning American Indian artwork of Peggy Fontenot, one of the 1,500 members of the Patawomeck Tribe of Virginia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s history is with Pocahontas, John Smith and Jamestown,\u201d Fontenot, who now lives in California, tells Watchdog.org.\n\nIn her more than three decades as an artist, Fontenot\u2019s photography and jewelry have been shown, sold, worn and won awards all over the country. But under a new law in Oklahoma \u2014 a state that is home to some of America\u2019s richest Indian history and culture \u2014 Fontenot is prohibited from calling herself or her work \u201cNative American.\u201d\n\nThat, according to a federal civil rights lawsuit filed Nov. 22 by the Pacific Legal Foundation against the Oklahoma attorney general, violates Fontenot\u2019s free-speech rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cPeggy is a member of a state-recognized tribe, the Patawomeck in Virginia,\u201d explains PLF lead counsel Caleb Trotter. \u201cShe is objectively and factually an American Indian and she should be able to call herself that whenever she\u2019s in Oklahoma or Rhode Island or Virginia or wherever.\u201d (See related PLF video here.)\n\nThe Oklahoma law took effect in August. It amended the 1974 American Indian Arts and Crafts Sales Act to restrict the definition of \u201cNative American\u201d and Native American-made products to members of federally recognized tribes.\n\nSince many tribes, such as the Patawomeck are recognized only by certain states, Fontenot and those like her can sell their wares in Oklahoma, but they cannot market them as Native American made, nor can they discuss their heritage while selling.\n\nThe law drew strong support from the powerful and politically connected Cherokee Nation and four other prominent Oklahoma tribes \u2014 the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole. Cherokee Principal Chief Bill John Baker wrote in April that \u201cthe issue is important for us because it ensures people who falsely claim tribal citizenship will not be able to market themselves and their crafts as native.\u201d\n\nCherokee Nation Chief of Staff Chuck Hoskin echoed Baker\u2019s concern in a statement emailed to Watchdog.\n\n\u201cWe must be vigilant against impostors and fraudulent marketing. Unsuspecting consumers have purchased fraudulent Indian art in the past here in Oklahoma,\u201d Hoskin wrote.\u201dPeople who falsely claim to be Native or say they are citizens of tribes not recognized in Oklahoma or by the federal government hurt the Indian Art industry.\u201d\n\nTrotter questions this premise, as the state already has a general \u2018truth in advertising\u2019 law to address such fraud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it happens \u2014 but to address this problem [Oklahoma lawmakers] have just gone way overboard and had the effect of carving out the Oklahoma market solely for their members and citizens to the exclusion of everybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether intentional or not, it has had a protectionist effect and gone way beyond the bounds of what a constitutional way of doing this would.\u201d\n\nIn addition to serving as an elected member of the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council, Hoskin is also an elected member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives, and primary sponsor of the Indian art law. In March, his son, Chuck Hoskin Jr., was unanimously reconfirmed to a second term as Cherokee Nation Secretary of State. The law\u2019s sponsor in the senate, Sen. John Sparks, is also an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation. Followthemoney.org shows Sparks has received $26,500 in campaign donations from the Cherokee and Chickasaw Nations, while Rep. Hoskin has collected more than $47,000 in tribal campaign contributions.\n\nThe right kind of tribe\n\nFor all the debate about who is a real Indian or a real Oklahoman, none of the tribes supporting the law are native to Oklahoma. All were driven there under duress in the 19th century by a federal government that now has laws in place to protect members of both federally and state-recognized tribes.\n\n\u201cThis issue is who is a real Indian and who is not a real Indian,\u201d she said. \u201cI can call myself \u2018Indian\u2019 all day long and I can identify as an Indian, but when I qualify myself as an Indian artist, I am protected under the federal law, just not the law in Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nThe 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act protects the rights of American Indian artists no matter what the recognizing entity is, or if they\u2019re certified as an artisan by an Indian tribe.\n\n\u201cAll Peggy wants to do is truthfully market and describe her art as American Indian made,\u201d Trotter said. \u201cJust because she\u2019s not a member of the \u2018right\u2019 kind of tribe in Oklahoma, she\u2019s precluded from telling people who she is in the context of selling or describing her art.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the First Amendment challenge, Fontenot raises four other constitutional claims \u2014 the Supremacy, Commerce, Equal Protection and Due Process clauses.\n\n\u201cThis state law limits Peggy\u2019s right to earn a living,\u201d Trotter said. \u201cThe federal law specifically sets up three separate categories of people who qualify to market and label their art American Indian made. But Oklahoma has decided that, \u2018No no. We\u2019re going to cut out two-thirds of those groups that federal law permits and create just in Oklahoma, this one little market.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn a resolution adopted this fall, the National Congress of American Indians condemned the law, citing the civil rights violations alleged in Fontenot\u2019s lawsuit. The NCAI also warned that if the law is not challenged in Oklahoma, \u201cother states may consider similarly oppressive legislation.\u201d\n\nFontenot says regardless of any good intentions on the part of Oklahoma, the law is little more than identity theft.\n\n\u201cI live my life as a Native American,\u201d she says. \u201cI identify with that side of my heritage. I\u2019ve raised my daughter as a Native American. I\u2019m a Native American artist and I\u2019ve been selling my work as Native American for 33 years.\u201d", "description": "The Smithsonian National Museum in Washington, D.C., and Sports Illustrated .09/02/2019 3:05:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Kathy Hoekstra", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/11/Peggy-picture-3-300x200.jpg"}
