He has also faced further allegations of sexual assault.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner stars in the film\n\nIn an interview released by festival organisers, the director drew parallels between the film's themes and his own case. \"I can see the same determination to deny the facts and condemn me for things I have not done,\" he said. \"Most of the people who harass me do not know me and know nothing about the case.\"\n\nHis wife, French actress Emmanuelle Seigner, who stars in the film, told a press conference that his experiences had informed his film-making. \"The feeling of persecution, I think is quite simple to understand. It is enough to see his life,\" she said.\n\n'Obscene' comparison\n\nIn his review of the film, Variety magazine's critic Owen Gleiberman said the comparison between Dreyfus and Polanski was \"obscene\".\n\n\"We can have a debate, and should, about how Hollywood, and the American legal system, should now treat Roman Polanski,\" he wrote. \"Alfred Dreyfus, however, was an innocent man... Whereas Polanski, before he fled the United States while awaiting sentencing in 1977, confessed in court.\"\n\nThe director currently divides his time between France, Poland and Switzerland, all of which have refused to extradite him.\n\nAt a press conference earlier in the week, Martel said she found it hard to separate Polanski's art from his past crime.\n\n\"I do not divide the artists from their works of art. I think that important aspects about the work of art emerge from the man,\" she said.\n\nAn Officer and a Spy is among the 21 movies selected to compete for the top prize at Venice.", "description": "An Officer And A Spy was screened in competition, despite concerns from the jury president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DFE4/production/_108561375_056138243.jpg"}
