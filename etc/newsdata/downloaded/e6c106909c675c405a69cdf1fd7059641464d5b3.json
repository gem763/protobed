But I would like to wish her family well.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump descends from Air Force One at Moffett Federal Airfield in Mountain View, Calif., on Tuesday. (Tom Brenner/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump reacted Tuesday to the death of journalist and political commentator Cokie Roberts from complications from breast cancer by saying \u201cshe never treated me nicely\u201d before adding that she was \u201ca real professional\u201d and wishing her family well.\n\n\u201cI never met her,\u201d Trump told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One. \u201cShe never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional.\u201d\n\n[Cokie Roberts, Emmy-winning journalist and political commentator, dies at 75]\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came during a 50-minute off-the-record conversation with reporters traveling with him from Albuquerque to Mountain View, Calif., where he plans to attend fundraisers. Trump later allowed some parts of the conversation to be on the record, including his comments about Roberts.\n\nRoberts became one of the most prominent Washington broadcasters of her era and championed young women in media during a long career with NPR and ABC News.\n\nShe earned three Emmy Awards, was inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame in 2000 and was named a \u201cLiving Legend\u201d by the Library of Congress in 2008.\n\nShe was 75.\n\nIn March 2016, Roberts and her husband, Steve Roberts, jointly wrote a column in which they called on \u201cthe rational wing\u201d of the Republican Party to reject Trump as their presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are far too high for the rationalists to stay on the sidelines, and their first motive should be political self-interest,\u201d they wrote.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, the journalist and Trump also sparred on live television over the impact of his rhetoric on race.\n\nWith Trump on the phone during an MSNBC broadcast, Roberts described reports of racist slurs that children were using against their classmates in Trump\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cAre you proud of that? Is that something that you\u2019ve done in American social and political discourse that you are proud of?\u201d Roberts asked.\n\n\u201cI think your question is a very nasty question,\u201d Trump responded, before saying he had not heard of such reports.\n\nFormer presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush were among other politicians who reacted to Roberts\u2019s death on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cShe was a trailblazing figure; a role model to young women at a time when the profession was still dominated by men; a constant over forty years of a shifting media landscape and changing world, informing voters about the issues of our time and mentoring young journalists every step of the way,\u201d Obama said in a statement.\n\nBush and former first lady Laura Bush said in a joint statement that Roberts \u201ccovered us for decades as a talented, tough, and fair reporter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe respected her drive and appreciated her humor. She became a friend,\u201d they added.\n\nHarrison Smith contributed to this report.", "description": "The president reacted to the passing of the prominent journalist and political commentator during a flight on Air Force One to California.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UE2a2RIz272hPfupEKMdhRcS1lk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SRBDCPGZPEI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
