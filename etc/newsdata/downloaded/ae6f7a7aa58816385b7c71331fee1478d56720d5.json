Shipments are down for autos, coal, grain, chemicals and consumer goods, with the only bright spot.\n\nThe rail downturn underscores the damage from the U.S.-China trade war, which is making shippers more cautious and crimping freight -- validating earlier warnings from railroad executives. Companies that stocked up on inventory last year amid President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats are now working it off. Adding to the cargo drop, a brief rise in coal exports has fizzled and bad weather has delayed crop harvests and dragged down grain carloads.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s quite clear is that we\u2019re not yet at a trough. Trains have not yet bottomed,\u201d said Ben Hartford, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. \u201cWe need to have some clarity in trade policy.\u201d\n\nWhile a railroad recession doesn\u2019t necessarily presage a broader slump, it\u2019s a dramatic turn from a year ago when rising shipments of autos, coal, lumber, chemicals and other commodities spurred U.S. rail carloads to rise 3.6% in 2018. Last year\u2019s hot freight market jacked up trucking prices, and transportation costs spiked for companies including General Mills Inc (NYSE: ). and Procter & Gamble Co.\n\n\u2018No Pockets\u2019\n\nNow, \u201cthere are no pockets of growth,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lee Klaskow, who sounded the alarm about a \u201crailroad recession\u201d in a recent report. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing that\u2019s tapping me on the shoulder saying, \u2018Hey look at me. I\u2019m going to be your next growth engine.\u2019\u201d\n\nA rail recession isn\u2019t necessarily a harbinger of a general economic downturn, Klaskow said. The U.S. economy continued to expand when carloads fell 2.1% in 2015 and 4.5% in 2016, after a crude-by-rail boom went bust.\n\nInvestors are partially insulated from the recent drop because earnings are holding up at the four large publicly traded railroads in the U.S., which have adopted an efficiency strategy developed by Hunter Harrison. The industry guru died in 2017 after overhauling CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: ) with his \u201cprecision scheduled railroading\u201d approach.\n\nCSX (NASDAQ: ) is the only major U.S. railroad that is poised to see earnings drop in the third quarter from a year earlier. Increases are expected at Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: ), Norfolk Southern (NYSE: ) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE: ), which adopted the efficiency techniques after CSX and are still reaping the rewards. That\u2019s shoring up the railroads\u2019 shares, although only Kansas City Southern is outperforming a Standard & Poor\u2019s index of U.S. industrial companies.\n\nFactory Slump\n\nCargo volumes have held up better at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and Canadian National Railway Co., as more maritime cargo from Asia shifts to Canadian ports. But in the U.S., sagging freight shipments are taking a toll.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management\u2019s factory index slipped to 47.8 in September, the lowest since June 2009. It was also the second straight month the index was below 50, which signals contraction.\n\nTruckers are also feeling the pain. Less-than-truckload cargo, which tends to be tied to industrial production, plummeted 12% in August from a year earlier. Freight carried by long-haul trucking is still growing as consumer spending holds up. Truck cargo prices, though, have dropped.\n\nCheaper trucking rates are pulling some freight from rails. But even if that trend moderates next year and the decline in rail carloads slows, there\u2019s no guarantee of growth -- especially if the factory weakness drags down consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the risk at this point in time, that the consumer does begin to show impacts from the pain that we see on the manufacturing side,\u201d Hartford said. As for rail freight, \u201cwhen is it going to turn? I honestly have no idea.\u201d", "description": "American Railroads Are Already in Recession With No End in Sight", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc36573058eafe94b76dc61a42234d341.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
