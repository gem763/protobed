(Kate Patterson for The Washington Post)\n\nFriday, Sept. 20\n\n\u201cJudy Chicago \u2014 The End: A Meditation on Death and Extinction\u201d at the National Museum of Women in the Arts: Few ways to wind down a career of pioneering feminist art are bolder than titling an exhibition \u201cThe End.\u201d But this is right in line with Judy Chicago\u2019s accomplished body of work, which grapples with creation, life and identity. The 80-year-old artist\u2019s latest exhibition features nearly 40 works of glass and porcelain, plus two larger bronze sculptures, focusing on the meaning of death as well as the artist\u2019s own mortality. The National Museum of Women in the Arts debuts this exhibition with a talk by Chicago, who will discuss her new book as well as \u201cThe End.\u201d (Sunday from 4:30 to 8 p.m., $65-$80.) Through Jan. 20, 2020. Free-$10.\n\nMartyn at DC24: The idea behind this weekend\u2019s DC24 festival is elegant enough. Motley crews of DJs from all across the area \u2014 including Juana, Sam \u201cthe Man\u201d Burns, DJ Lisa Frank and others \u2014 will spin a wild variety of rhythms for 24 hours straight, all love, no interruptions. The metaphorical group-hug might feel especially warm for Martyn, an outlier booked to perform smack in the middle of it all. \u201cThe [DJs] that I know in D.C. give off a really familial vibe, and I think that\u2019s something I really need sometimes,\u201d the 45-year-old says. \u201cI\u2019m part of so many different worlds.\u201d DC24 begins at 10 p.m. Martyn performs on Saturday at 3:30 a.m. The venue address will be announced to ticket holders on Friday. $35.\n\n[After a near-death experience, Martyn\u2019s life feels different. So does his music.]\n\nEnd-Of-Summer Camp at the Smithsonian American Art Museum: Brightest Young Things\u2019 last late-night museum soiree of the year is, fittingly, an end-of-summer party. The night\u2019s itinerary includes pairings of s\u2019mores and bourbon, a hammock lounge, a drag queen talent show and two DJ sets, including one from Baltimore\u2019s own Dan Deacon. A ticket gets you access to an open bar with cocktails from the likes of Columbia Room and Archipelago \u2014 as well as Smirnoff sno-cones. 8:30 p.m. $65.\n\nOcto Octa & Eris Drew at Flash: As DJs and producers, Octo Octa and Eris Drew are masters of emotionally charged house music. Their most recent releases, Drew\u2019s \u201cRaving Disco Breaks Vol. 1\u201d mix tape and Octo Octa\u2019s \u201cResonant Body\u201d LP, are full of classic breakbeats and reminiscent of raves past. Their music has also been revelatory and self-exploratory, especially as they are both trans women who have come out and transitioned in the public eye. The romantic partners and musical collaborators have founded a label that was birthed from the pair\u2019s \u201clove of DJ culture, nature, magic and each other,\u201d and the magic will be in action during this back-to-back DJ set. 10 p.m. $15.\n\n[4 concerts to catch in the D.C. area over the next several days]\n\nSaturday, Sept. 21\n\nH Street Festival and Clarendon Day: When it comes to weather, September is the D.C. area\u2019s Goldilocks season: Not too hot, not too cool. No wonder so many neighborhood festivals take over our streets this month. Two of the area\u2019s biggest take place on the same day. The H Street Festival rapidly evolved into a massive celebration that can draw more than 150,000 people to an 11-block stretch of Northeast Washington. The attractions are legion: multiple stages with go-go, rock and gospel performers; a pie-eating contest; fashion shows for people and canines; art displays; and beer and food gardens hosted by the strip\u2019s bars and restaurants. A few miles west-southwest, Clarendon Day shuts down Wilson and Clarendon boulevards \u2014 and a few side streets \u2014 for multiple music stages, beer and wine gardens, family-friendly activities, including the Arlington Art Truck, and rooftop parties at the neighborhood\u2019s numerous bars. H Street Festival: noon to 7 p.m. Clarendon Day: 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free.\n\nOktoberfest at various locations: Oktoberfest kicks off this Saturday in Munich, and many local bars and restaurants \u2014 German-themed as well as those that just like beer \u2014 will follow suit. The most notable is at Heurich House, where the museum, home of 20th century brewing magnate Christian Heurich, will tap a recreation of Heurich\u2019s Senate Lager, a 1940s flagship beer that was re-created from an old lab report. The $65 Heurich Oktoberfest tickets include unlimited pours of Senate, and beers and ciders from local producers, including Red Bear, Sankofa and Anxo. Navy Yard\u2019s Bluejacket releases the Hill House Fest lager and celebrates by tapping five other German-inspired brews, unveiling a one-day menu including schnitzel sliders and spaetzle, and bringing in a band to play Bavarian tunes. The Berliner Beer Hall in Georgetown has a solid lineup of German beers, but they\u2019re beginning Oktoberfest with a local option: the new Oktoberfest M\u00e4rzen from Silver Spring\u2019s Silver Branch. The keg is tapped at noon, and the first 24 people to order one receive a brewery tankard. Make sure you pair it with the housemade brats.\n\nWiener 500 at the Wharf: If most Oktoberfest celebrations blur together in a haze of lederhosen, pretzels and oompah bands, let us introduce you to the Wiener 500, the most singular Oktoberfest celebration in Washington. Dozens of dachshunds race to determine the speediest wiener dog while crowds roar them on, and all the action is shown on a 17-foot screen. (Yes, it\u2019s as hilarious as it sounds.) Outside the sprinting pups, there\u2019s a beer garden, stein-holding competitions, DJs and a doggy costume contest that\u2019s open to all breeds. Proceeds from the event benefit the Humane Rescue Alliance. 1 to 5 p.m. Free.\n\nMuseum Day at various locations: Washingtonians sometimes take our free museums for granted \u2014 so much so that we might balk at paying admission fees at local museums that aren\u2019t free. The annual Museum Day is a chance to see some of these paid museums for zero dollars. Tickets have already been snatched up for some notable destinations, such as the Museum of the Bible and the Newseum, but you can still use this opportunity to marvel at the grand columns of the National Building Museum or see Judy Chicago\u2019s new exhibit at the National Museum of Women in the Arts without paying a cent. Museum hours vary. Free.\n\nNational Philharmonic at Strathmore: Ever since it changed its name from the Montgomery County Chamber Orchestra, the National Philharmonic has shown its ambitions to compete with the big guys. The largest of the orchestras surveyed here, it performs in the same hall as the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, and at about the same ticket prices. That\u2019s steep competition, and having to sell so many tickets to a large concert hall also leads to middle-of-the-road programming and a mixture of pops concerts. (This year, one program is devoted to the music of Abba.) This weekend brings a program of all Beethoven compositions. Through Sunday. (Saturday: 8 p.m.; Sunday: 3 p.m.) Free-$79.\n\n[Struggling orchestras take note: These regional groups are alive and well, and play interesting music]\n\nSunday, Sept. 22\n\n\u2018Labyrinth\u2019 at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: If you\u2019ve been to the Hirshhorn in the past few years, you\u2019ve certainly seen the \u201cBig Man.\u201d Or maybe you\u2019ve seen a picture of him slouched in his corner. Well, the sculpture by artist Ron Mueck is leaving the gallery for an undetermined amount of time, so to send him off, the modern art museum is hosting a screening of Jim Henson\u2019s cult classic \u201cLabyrinth\u201d starring David Bowie. Mueck puppeteered and voiced Ludo, the beast who guides Jennifer Connelly\u2019s Sarah on her quest. 2 to 4 p.m. Free.\n\nMarch on Washington Film Festival: A week of thought-provoking, civil-rights-related films begins with a showing of the acclaimed Aretha Franklin documentary \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at Washington National Cathedral. The festival, which was founded six years ago to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, is hosting events and screenings throughout the city, including a documentary on former congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, a virtual-reality experience with Oculus VR about the history and legacy of \u201cThe Negro Motorist Green Book\u201d and three nights of live performances at the Eaton DC\u2019s rooftop. Through Sept. 29. Free-$20.\n\n\u2014 Hau Chu, Fritz Hahn, Adele Chapin, Chris Kelly, Anne Midgette and Chris Richards", "description": "Catch the H Street Festival, Clarendon Day, a 24-hour DJ festival and a special screening of \"Labyrinth\" at the Hirshhorn.", "authors": ["Going Out Guide Staff", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8WlUh5m_W86BInBKGIxAJUG9_ek=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYLUEWZK6VEZRIQPB66S5D52KU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
