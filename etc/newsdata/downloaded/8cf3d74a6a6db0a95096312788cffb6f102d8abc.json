They included World Cup qualifying games and the 2016 Copa American centenary tournament.\n\nThough Sanz was not publicly charged or sentenced, prosecutors alleged he also took part in bribery schemes working for sports agency Traffic USA before joining CONCACAF in 2012.\n\nThe indictment said he obtained an \u201cexpensive painting from an art gallery in New York\u201d as a bribe while working for Jeffrey Webb, then CONCACFA\u2019s leader and a FIFA vice president. Webb, a banker from the Cayman Islands, pleaded guilty to various financial crimes and is awaiting sentence.\n\nFIFA said its ethics judges charged Sanz with bribery only during his 2012-15 work with CONCACAF. He was found guilty and fined 100,000 Swiss francs ($100,000).\n\nIn 2014, the Colombia-born official took a leave of absence from CONCACAF, which also covers Central America and the Caribbean, while being treated for leukemia.\n\nSanz was suspended by FIFA\u2019s ethics committee when the sprawling American investigation was unsealed in May 2015, and he was fired by CONCACAF weeks later.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "FIFA has imposed a life ban for bribery on Enrique Sanz, the former general secretary of North American soccer body CONCACAF.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
