In a report released on Tuesday, RPA and the TIAA Institute, a division of the investment management firm TIAA, found that more than 90% of private foundations they surveyed care most about student access to higher education and their success at completing their programs.\n\nThe report, \u201cPhilanthropy in Higher Education, Priorities and Approaches of Private Foundations,\u201d builds and expands on research RPA and the TIAA Institute completed two years ago. The foundations surveyed range in size from $1 million to \u201cwell over\u201d $1 billion in assets, with 83% supporting post-secondary education. The largest group of respondents, at 31%, are $101 million to $500 million in size.\n\nA trend consistent to both reports is that foundations are still overwhelmingly focused on student access to, and success in, higher education, says Holmes, co-author of the report.\n\nFor the latest edition, RPA and TIAA sought to include a more diverse group of foundations by reaching out to members of Grantmakers for Education, a national philanthropic organization, and interviewing 10 foundations across the country that give directly to colleges and universities, including the Annie E. Casey Foundation in Baltimore, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation in Austin, and the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust in Vancouver, Wash.\n\nOne nuance the report authors observed was that more foundations are viewing education as a tool for achieving career sustainability versus just looking at education as a good thing unto itself, Holmes says.\n\nOn the topic of student access and success, 78% of those surveyed view the transition from high school to a two-year or four-year college or university as their main priority. Their second priority, however, was career readiness and employability.\n\nThe findings were consistent with what they\u2019ve heard about funders \u201cbeing most concerned about students that are relatively vulnerable, or students that may be the first in their families to go to college, or students that may be from low-income backgrounds and will need additional programmatic support on transitioning smoothly into first, maybe a two-year school and then hopefully into a four-year school,\u201d Holmes says.\n\n\u201cThat was really something that we didn't hear as much two and three years ago when we were doing our first round of research,\u201d she says.\n\nOne outgrowth of this focus is a growing interest in community colleges\u2014two-year, public institutions that are geared toward guiding their students to a solid career path. The big dollars are still mostly flowing to large, public research universities, with only 1.5% of $43.6 billion raised by colleges and universities in 2017 going to two-year institutions, the Council for Advancement and Support of Education Voluntary Support of Education 2017-19 survey found.\n\nBut, Holmes says, \u201cthere is also evidence that foundations increasingly see community colleges as an important part of their giving strategies.\u201d As funders seek to \u201csupport the flow of students from education to career, community colleges, especially for those underrepresented students, will continue to be a really important tool.\u201d\n\nFor colleges and universities, an interesting finding is that while most private foundations give directly to these institutions, more dollars are granted to funding networks of colleges and universities that work together \u201cto achieve shared goals,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThey do so, the report says, because many schools have common goals, so \u201cmaking one grant to address shared needs across multiple campuses is a compelling strategy.\u201d Also, it can be viewed as a more efficient approach, and it gives colleges and universities a chance to learn from one another.\n\nAnne Ollin, a senior director at the TIAA Institute, works directly with colleges and universities, which, in an effort to boost their own financial stability and advance their goals, are increasingly looking for guidance in how to work more effectively with foundations that are taking this approach.\n\nThey are asking, \u201chow do they come together around a shared objective and present their proposal to a foundation in a way that they all get a share, or how can they all work together effectively with the foundation to advance their shared goal,\u201d Ollin says.\n\nThe report also showed that more funding is going toward public colleges and universities instead of private. \u201cThat was intentional, because a large majority of students [nearly 75%] do attend public colleges and universities,\u201d Holmes says. Funders that \u201care really interested in kind of impacting the most students possible, they tend to direct their funding mostly to public.\u201d", "description": "Private foundations increasingly also care about career readiness, a report from Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors and the TIAA Institute shows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-121858/social", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
