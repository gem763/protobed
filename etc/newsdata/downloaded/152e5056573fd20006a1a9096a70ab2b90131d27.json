You should be asking him the question \u2015 why is on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader?\u201d\n\nContinuing, Joe Biden contended Trump\u2019s attempts to raise suspicion over his son\u2019s past are nothing more than political attacks meant to handicap him as Election Day draws near.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum, and he\u2019s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody looked at this, and everybody\u2019s looked at said there\u2019s nothing there. Ask the right questions!\u201d\n\nJoe Biden gets fired up when Fox News' Peter Doocy asks him how many times he discussed overseas business dealings with Hunter, insisting that he's \"never spoken\" with his son about that before demanding that Doocy \"ask the right questions\" as it relates to Trump. pic.twitter.com/UU78mddkxC \u2014 Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) September 21, 2019\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, in July, Trump called Zelensky and asked him about eight times to assist attorney Rudy Giuliani with a probe of Hunter Biden, believing it could bolster his chances at being elected to a second term.\n\nOn Aug. 12, a member of the intelligence community filed a complaint raising concerns over Trump\u2019s conversation, The Washington Post reported. The document is now in the hands of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who has not yet turned it over to Congress as required by law.\n\nGiuliani has spent months attempting to stir up skepticism over Hunter Biden\u2019s work, which occurred during Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidency when he pushed for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor general heading up an investigation into Burisma. However, Hunter Biden\u2019s position has long been publicly known, there is no evidence Joe Biden was aware of the probe, and Giuliani\u2019s theory remains unfounded.", "description": "The former vice president says Trump is attempting to upend his 2020 bid with a \"smear.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8805d82100006705d94faa.jpeg?cache=gj2ssor1xq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
