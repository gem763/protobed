With the protests attracting global attention, the demonstrators and the authorities are also fighting a PR battle. On Saturday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry took an unusual step of distributing images of alleged protester vandalism to the international press, in an apparent attempt to discredit the movement. (Nikkei Asian Review)\n\nThe commentary comes after a weekend of tense clashes between police and protesters. On Saturday, protesters lit fires and threw petrol bombs, while police fired tear gas and water cannons. Authorities also targeted suspected protesters in metro stations, beating them with batons. On Sunday, protesters blocked roads and transportation links to the Hong Kong airport.\n\nThe pro-democracy demonstrations, which began over a proposed extradition bill and other demands, have been occurring for nearly three months.", "description": ".09/03/2019 19:37:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/f9657bc0-28c0-42a9-8549-9edce23f58ce.png"}
