I deal with my addiction.\n\n'When I was younger and I wanted to see something like that I had to pay someone that was older to go to 7/11 and buy it.'\n\nKanye said his addiction to watching porn began when he found a Playboy magazine at the age of five and it's 'affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life'.\n\nThe remarks jar somewhat with the fact that his wife Kim, who has 150 million Instagram followers, frequently shares sexy, suggestive snaps on her page.\n\nBut Kanye has turned his newfound religious fervor on his wife as well, urging her to meet his newly-adopted ideas about modesty.\n\nIn an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians that first aired on October 13, he criticized the revealing, figure-hugging Mugler gown Kim wore to the Met Gala earlier this year.\n\nKanye criticized the revealing, figure-hugging Mugler gown Kim wore to the Met Gala earlier this year\n\n'Like the corset, underwear, all that vibe, I just feel like I just went through this transition of being rapper, and lookin' at all these girls,' Kanye said in the episode.\n\n'I didn't realize that that was affecting like my soul and my spirit,' he went on, adding that he wasn't OK with Kim wearing revealing clothing.\n\n'You are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy,' he told her.\n\n'A corset is like a form of underwear. It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?' he said.\n\nKim fired back in the episode, telling Kanye he was giving her 'really bad anxiety' and putting out 'negative energy,' especially because he raised the issue the night before the Met Gala.\n\n'You built me up to be a sexy person and have confidence! Just because you're on a journey and you're in a transformation, doesn't mean I'm in the same spot with you,' she said.\n\nKanye's ideas about modesty for women also apply to his children, or at least the his daughters North, six, and Chicago, 21 months.\n\nHe and Kim also share sons Saint, three, and Psalm, five months.\n\nKim told E! News this month that even though North has begun playing with makeup, Kanye has now banned cosmetics until she's older.\n\n'North is trying to get in on the makeup but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager,' she said. 'It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best.'\n\n'I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.'\n\nKanye himself said he also pulled crop tops off the table.\n\n'A smart man has the ability to pivot to say I think something different now. I don\u2019t think this because it\u2019s the culture,' he said.\n\n'I don\u2019t think North should wear crop tops just because I had her wearing a slip dress when she was two years old.'\n\n'I don\u2019t think North should wear crop tops just because I had her wearing a slip dress when she was two years old,' he said\n\nKanye's new ideas about women's dress has drawn some criticism from fans, particularly those calling the rapper a hypocrite for encouraging Kim's sexy image for years.\n\nHe's even included Kim in his music videos in various states of undress \u2014 and before that, he cast other scantily-clad women like Teyana Taylor in his videos.\n\nBut not everyone is quick to condemn him. In fact, he seems to have found new fans in Christian fundamentalists Jinger Duggar, 25, and Jeremy Vuolo, 32, stars of TLC's Counting On.\n\nThe couple attended Kanye's Sunday Service this weekend, and afterward Jeremy shared a a favorable in-depth analysis of Kanye's religious awakening.\n\n'I've been praying about it, and obviously praying for Kanye,' Jeremy said of Kanye's spiritual journey.\n\n'Now with his album dropping, it's interesting to listen to it... but it's also interesting to see a lot of the reactions. Some people [are] vehemently against it.\n\n'The claim that Kanye is making [now] is that he's been regenerated, meaning that he's been born again,' he said.\n\nKanye said his addiction to watching porn began when he found a Playboy magazine at the age of five\n\nJeremy warned others not to judge or to '[look] at a sinner like Kanye West and [say], \"Jesus could never save him\" or \"How dare you claim that Jesus would save him, he's still the same old filthy sinner.\"'\n\nHe also praised the 'theologically sound' men who are 'discipling' Kanye.\n\n'Kanye is surrounding himself with good people,' he added. 'So that gives me confidence.\n\n'It encourages me to see that Kanye is not only claiming to be born again, but he's surrounding himself with really good people that are theologically sound.'\n\nSpeaking of Sunday Service in particular, Jeremy praised the 'astonishing' musical performance.\n\n'It struck me as an outburst of praise coming from a captive soul that's been set free,' he said.\n\n'I enjoyed it. I think, honestly, from an artistic, from a musical perspective, it was one of the greatest pieces of art, of musical art, that I've ever witnessed live.'\n\nKanye performed songs from his new album, Jesus is King, along with a choir at his Sunday Service at The Forum in LA on Sunday\n\nJinger Duggar and her husband Jeremy Vuolo attended Kanye West's Sunday Service this weekend\n\nIn the new Beats 1 interview, Kanye also praised Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, branding him his favorite founder.\n\nKanye called Dorsey 'incredibly smart, a visionary' and praised Dorsey's history as a founder, naming Twitter and Square.\n\n'Jack Dorsey has created an app where someone can buy into that stock at a dollar,' West said about Dorsey's pilot stock-trading app that lets anyone invest in stock for a dollar.\n\nThe songwriter also said Dorsey was one of the first people who wanted to invest in him early on in his career.\n\nHe talked about the different visions between founders and investors, and his respect for founders.\n\n'You've gotta honor living founders, those are the great great great great grandfathers of what's being built.\n\nWhile discussing founders, West made it clear that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was not one of his favorites.\n\n'I will always remember every meeting and interaction I've had with Jack Dorsey, and I will always remember my meetings and interactions with Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and they've been completely different,' he said.", "description": "Kanye West, 42, made the explosive claims in a wide-ranging interview with radio host Big Boy on Friday while promoting his new album, Jesus Is King.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/20373398-0-image-a-22_1572437398334.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
