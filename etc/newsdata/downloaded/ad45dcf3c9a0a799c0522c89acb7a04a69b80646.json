After a slow start, Cousins had six touchdown passes and one interception in wins over Philadelphia and the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cThat team is on fire right now,\u201d Lions coach Matt Patricia said.\n\nDetroit (2-2-1) has dropped two straight after an unbeaten, three-game start because it failed to keep double-digit leads against the Packers and Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let it stick around in your head because there\u2019s a long season left,\u201d Flowers said.\n\nIf the Lions don\u2019t win Sunday at home, though, their chances to contend in the competitive division will take a hit.\n\nMinnesota, meanwhile, wants to avoid starting 0-3 in the NFC North after playing its first three division games as visitors.\n\n\u201cWe get them all at home at the end, so it all evens out,\u201d Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said.\n\nHere are some things to watch when the Lions face the Vikings:\n\nSTACKS OF SACKS\n\nVikings defensive end Danielle Hunter leads the league with eight tackles for losses. He set an NFL record with a sack against the Eagles that gave him 46 for his career, the most in history by a player younger than 25. Hunter has two more games before his birthday, and the Lions have provided him plenty of pass-rushing opportunities in the past. Hunter has seven sacks in six games against them, plus three fumble recoveries and one he returned for a 32-yard touchdown.\n\nSTALLING OUT\n\nThe Lions lost to the Packers at least in part because they scored only one touchdown and had to settle for Matt Prater\u2019s five field goals. That followed a trend.\n\nIn goal-to-go situations, Detroit ranks 30th in the NFL with four touchdowns in nine chances.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough,\u201d quarterback Matthew Stafford acknowledged.\n\nInside the 20, Detroit has gotten into the end zone on half of its 16 opportunities to rank among the bottom third of the league.\n\nThe problem may be ominous for the Lions because they were relegated to scoring only on field goals in two losses to Minnesota last year.\n\nMILESTONE MARKER\n\nStafford is 87 yards passing from setting a record for the fewest games to reach the 40,000-yard mark. Matt Ryan reached that number in 151 games, five more than Stafford has played.\n\n\u201cWhen you step back and look at stuff like that, I think it\u2019s just pretty amazing,\u201d Patricia said.\n\nStafford has bounced back from a lackluster year with a solid season so far as the league\u2019s ninth-ranked passer. He has thrown nine touchdown passes and two interceptions, both coming in a Week 2 win over the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\u201cStafford is playing outstanding, maybe the best I\u2019ve ever seen him,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cHe\u2019s throwing the ball into a lot of tight windows. He\u2019s pulling the trigger. He\u2019s still scrambling.\u201d\n\nFLYING FLAGS\n\nThough Minnesota hasn\u2019t been stung by questionable late-game calls quite like Detroit was at Green Bay, penalties have been an uncharacteristic problem for the team.\n\nThe Vikings had four penalties for 30 yards against them in their win over the Eagles last week, both season lows for a team that has been charged with the third-most penalty yardage in the league (456) and irritated its discipline-driven coach in the process.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Dave Campbell contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Detroit Lions are thankful they have a short week to prepare to play Minnesota in a possibly pivotal NFC North matchup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/lions_packers_football_66404_c0-186-4464-2790_s1200x700.jpg?348ab65bf0ffc7ae4b9d353b9baeb1bfe66a2c16", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
