With some targeted research, car buyers can confidently negotiate based on real pricing data and most dealers will recognize a fair offer.\n\nTricky sales phrases\n\nIf they don\u2019t check the numbers first, most car buyers don\u2019t know what a good deal is. That\u2019s because there are so many moving parts, such as financing, trade-in value and various tacked-on bogus and legitimate fees.\n\nCar dealers exploit this lack of knowledge and have a variety of little phrases to feed the egos of their customers as they try to fleece them. A favorite is, \u201cWe\u2019re not making a penny on this deal!\u201d\n\nOnce, when I was buying a car, the sales manager wrote on the deal sheet, \u201cMy children will go shoeless and hungry but I\u2019ll accept your offer.\u201d As if that weren\u2019t enough, he also drew little teardrops.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This is the most talked-about new Porsche\n\nThese phrases work with many people. I\u2019ve had friends who just bought a car tell me, \u201cYou know, I did so well negotiating, the dealer said I should get a job selling cars.\u201d\n\nThis is all just part of the psychology of sales. Yes, there are numbers too, the real dollars the buyer pays, as well as the profit the dealership makes. And let\u2019s be fair \u2014 the dealership deserves to make money, and the salesperson deserves a commission.\n\nStill, most car buyers simply want to know that they got a fair price. The dealer, on the other hand, wants maximum profit. So how do these two parties avoid confrontation and meet in a way that serves them both?\n\nKnow the numbers before you negotiate\n\nOften, I read advice about car-buying that says, \u201cDo your homework.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you, but I always hated doing homework.\n\nI like this advice: \u201cAn hour of research could save you $2,000.\u201d Two grand? Really? Actually, I\u2019m underestimating the amount. Here\u2019s a quick example.\n\nLet\u2019s say a couple is on their way to a movie theater when a new car catches their eye on a car lot. \u201cLet\u2019s just stop in and take a quick look,\u201d they say.\n\nAn hour later, the movie is forgotten and the couple is in a sales office. (Car salespeople call this getting the customer \u201cin the box.\u201d) They\u2019re blindly trying to negotiate the price of their trade-in, their new car monthly payment and the interest rate. Let\u2019s say they\u2019re given $1,000 under market value for their trade-in, are looking at paying $100 a month too much on the car payment and are planning to finance it for 72 months, which would mean paying $700 more than they should in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nBut they don\u2019t know they are getting ripped off. Instead, the salesperson assures them: \u201cYou\u2019re really beating us up \u2014 we\u2019re not going to make a penny on this deal.\u201d\n\nYou might like: The 10 best new cars for dog owners\n\nNow, rewind this scenario. This time, the couple spots the new car but proceeds to the movie as planned. Later, they check online pricing sites to see what the car is selling for, which is their target price. Then, they look up the value of their trade-in and the interest rate their credit score will get them.\n\nNext, they put all of this data into an auto loan payment calculator and get a reasonable monthly payment. Later, they shop their offer at several places and make a deal at or below their target price \u2014 all because their research showed them how to spot a good deal.\n\nThe difference between these two deals? Easily $2,000, and in some cases much more.\n\nKnowledge is power\n\nI\u2019ve spent the past 20 years writing about the psychology of car buying, deciphering the numbers behind car deals and studying the attitudes of buyers. This experience has impressed one thing on me: A little research will save you a ton of money. It\u2019s just another way of saying, \u201cknowledge is power.\u201d\n\nAlso on MarketWatch: 10 new compact SUVs for under $26,000\n\nYou might be wondering about all the other parts of negotiating you\u2019ve been told are important: the playacting, table-pounding and staring contests. Forget all that for the moment; instead, look at it this way: Simply knowing the numbers behind the deal will make you a good negotiator.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "With some targeted research, you can negotiate based on real pricing data and dealers will know a fair offer.", "authors": ["Philip Reed"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS150_nerd_s_ZG_20190926135637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
