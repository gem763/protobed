Biden, that they moved details of the call to a computer system for sensitive information.\n\nThe Times report suggests the whistleblower had the type of background that would equip him to understand the complex interplay between agencies and what was at stake in the call or other actions by people in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nAttorneys for the whistleblower criticized the paper\u2019s decision to publicize details about their client as \u201creckless,\u201d though Dean Banquet, the Times\u2019 executive editor, defended the decision.\n\n\u201cThe role of the whistle-blower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country \u2014 whether the president of the United States abused power and whether the White House covered it up,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
