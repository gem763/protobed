Those leases and the costs of building out new offices are forcing WeWork to raise cash and cut costs after its IPO failed.\n\nOn Tuesday, SoftBank Group Corp. won approval from WeWork's board to take control of the troubled co-working startup in a deal that would hand co-founder Adam Neumann nearly $1.7 billion and sever most of his ties with the company.\n\nWeWork has committed to lease payments of $10.2 billion between mid-2019 and the end of 2023, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it may have to spend up to $1 billion building out newly leased offices. In a bid to stem losses, We has slowed down new leasing. But that doesn't remove the potential burden of leases it has already signed.\n\nThe company's financial situation is more precarious than it appears because of build-out costs for new locations and because We has benefited from periods of free rent, which will require bigger outlays of cash when they end.\n\nWe says it generally takes 24 months until a new location is mostly occupied and generates stable profits. In its recent public filing with the SEC, We said it had signed leases for 258,000 workstations where construction work had yet to start as of June 1.\n\nThe company estimated that it spent an average of $3,661 building out a new workstation in the first half of the year. If the average cost stays roughly the same, the company could be on the hook for close to $1 billion in capital expenditures on newly signed leases over the coming years, not counting marketing and other pre-opening expenses.\n\nThe company had 239,000 workstations that were being built out as of June 1, and the company says most of those costs have already been incurred. That means We has nearly 500,000 workstations to lease out during a wave of bad publicity surrounding its failed IPO and the ouster of Neumann as chief executive.\n\nWeWork has doubled its footprint in each of the past two years, growing from 154,000 workstations in June 2017 to 301,000 desks a year later and 604,000 in June 2019. The company plans to open more than 80,000 desks a month on average this November and December, according to people familiar with the projections. That reflects leases signed before the botched IPO and is up from a monthly average of 23,000 in the first half of the year.\n\nLease costs are set to increase as more locations open, free-rent periods end and scheduled rent increases kick in. WeWork said its annual lease obligations are set to increase from $873.1 million in the second half of 2019, or around $1.75 billion annualized, to $2.43 billion in 2023. These figures only include leases that are already signed. The company expects revenue to increase as well.\n\nWeWork also faces cash costs for thousands of layoffs that are expected as part of its efforts to control costs. WeWork likely needs at least $3 billion to get through the next year, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Its bonds have plumbed new lows, as investors grow nervous it won't be able to repay them.\n\nAn economic downturn would only add to the risks. The biggest risk to the company is that it signs long-term leases but has short-term tenants that it could struggle to replace in a recession.\n\nWhile WeWork is able to abandon signed leases with landlords, many of these deals are backed by corporate guarantees or letters of credit, meaning the company would still lose money. There is also a reputation risk: If WeWork becomes known for breaking leases, property owners may demand higher rent or more guarantees on future deals.\n\nIn October 2018, WeWork agreed to lease an entire 115,000-square-foot office building in Midtown Manhattan. The landlord, Columbia Property Trust, negotiated corporate guarantees and letters of credit equivalent to 28 months of rent, Chief Executive Nelson Mills said during an earnings call last year. He touted what he called an attractive rent and said that WeWork agreed to renovate and build out the entire property, covering a big chunk of the cost. \"That also made it pretty compelling,\" Mr. Mills said. The location is expected to open before the end of the year.\n\nEliot Brown contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Konrad Putzier at konrad.putzier@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
