MUST WATCH The eDumper: The world's largest electric vehicle 01:31\n\nStopping power\n\nLike all electric vehicles, the eDumper harnesses power from braking.\n\nThrough a process called regenerative braking, the eDumper's electric motor goes into reverse when the driver hits the brake pads, releasing electricity that can be stored and returned to the battery.\n\nAnd the heavier the load, the stronger the braking and the more electricity can be recovered.\n\nEven Lucas di Grassi -- the 2017 Formula E championship winner -- was surprised by the eDumper's regenerative braking capacity.\n\n\"We had 75 tons of rocks and we went out of here with 90%, went all the way to the top,\" di Grassi told CNN Sport.\n\n\"We arrived with 80% battery, loaded up and on our way back, we recovered 8% so we came back with 88% -- that's actually pretty cool.\"\n\nPhotos: The 2018/19 Formula E season Formula E 2018/19 \u2013 The 2018/19 Formula E season proved to be a thriller, with the exciting new Gen2 cars boasting top speeds of 280km/h.

Making it cheaper, more efficient and greener. So, you're saving 50,000 tons of fuel per machine per year.\"\n\nPhotos: Could the future of racing be in the air?
