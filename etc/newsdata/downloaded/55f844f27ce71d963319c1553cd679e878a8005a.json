When SPCA staff took Waffles from the stall for treatment, Hemingway would display \"protective behaviors,\" she said.\n\nBucks County SPCA\n\n\"He'll honk and flap his wings and let you know, 'Hey leave my buddy alone,' or 'You better bring him back,'\" Kelly said. \"They really seem to have this bond.\"\n\nBucks County SPCA\n\nAfter Waffles and Hemingway's story went viral, the Bucks County SPCA received more than 150 applications for adoption, including at least one from outside the U.S., according to Kelly.\n\nBecause of Waffles and Hemingway's close bond, Bucks County SPCA officials decided to make them only adoptable together. The adoption donation was $300 for the pair, according to Kelly.", "description": "The unlikely friends were adopted after being rescued together in Pennsylvania.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/waffles-hemingway-miniature-horse-goose-friends-01-ht-jc-190903_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
