REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/Files\n\nPresident Donald Trump fired his national security adviser, a hawk on Iran who as a private citizen had advocated military action to destroy its nuclear program and who disagreed with his boss on policies from Afghanistan to Russia while in office.\n\nTrump\u2019s third national security adviser, Bolton had argued for driving Iranian oil exports to zero and against Trump\u2019s desire to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\n\u201cBolton has been \u2018Dr. No\u2019 when it comes to talks with Iran,\u201d Cliff Kupchan, a former State Department official now at the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy, wrote in an analysis.\n\nWhile Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei probably would not allow a meeting at this month\u2019s U.N. General Assembly, Kupchan said: \u201cThere\u2019s upward pressure on the chance of a meeting. If it does happen, we\u2019d see more downward umph on the oil price.\u201d\n\nU.S. oil prices fell more than 1 percent on the news of Bolton\u2019s departure, with investors betting that it increased the odds of the United States easing sanctions on Iran and reduced the odds of any possible U.S. military strike.\n\nWith Bolton\u2019s support, Trump last year abandoned the 2015 multilateral agreement reached by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions.\n\nTrump has since restored U.S. sanctions and moved in May to try to cut Iran\u2019s oil exports, historically its main source of foreign exchange and government revenues, to zero.\n\nThe Republican president argued the 2015 agreement did not do enough to keep Iran from eventually obtaining a nuclear weapon and he criticized it for failing to address Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and support for regional proxies.\n\nIran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes, such as power generation, and not to make bombs.\n\n\u2018COMPLETELY ALIGNED\u2019\n\nAt a briefing, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he, Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were \u201ccompletely aligned on our maximum pressure campaign.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials believe pressure will eventually force Iran to yield to their demands for, among other things, much more intrusive inspections of nuclear sites.\n\nAsked at the same briefing if he could foresee a Trump-Rouhani meeting this month, Pompeo replied: \u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has made very clear he is prepared to meet with no preconditions,\u201d Pompeo added.\n\nA former senior Trump administration official described Pompeo and Mnuchin as \u201csofter\u201d on Iran than Bolton and said that meant there was a chance for a Rouhani meeting if the Iranians dropped their demand for a full lifting of sanctions first.\n\nOther current and former U.S. officials said there had never been much doubt that a meeting, at least from Trump\u2019s point of view, was conceivable but that the odds of either side being willing to compromise were low.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump listens as his national security adviser John Bolton speaks during a presidential memorandum signing for the \"Women's Global Development and Prosperity\" initiative in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 7, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis/Files\n\n\u201cThe problem has never been imagining talks between the two sides,\u201d said Phil Gordon, a former Obama State Department and White House official, saying Trump had shown through his talks with North Korea that he \u201cloves to be at the center of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem, instead, is envisaging a deal that both sides could actually agree to. It is hard to see the Iranians accepting current U.S. conditions, which include ending uranium enrichment forever, even more intrusive inspections, constraints on ballistic missiles and a complete change in Iran\u2019s regional policy,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSo to get a deal, Trump would have to significantly lower the bar, which would be hard to sell domestically and in the region,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBolton\u2019s departure may remove one obstacle to that, but there are plenty still in the way.\u201d", "description": "John Bolton's departure from the White House removes an obstacle to the possibility of U.S.-Iranian nuclear talks, but the odds of such a dialogue leading anywhere remain low, current and former U.S. officials said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Arshad Mohammed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428540160&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A048", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
