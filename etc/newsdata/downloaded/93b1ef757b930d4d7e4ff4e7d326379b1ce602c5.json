Namely, social and economic and racial injustice. But still, this doesn\u2019t exactly make her sound terribly confident in Dems\u2019 impeachment prospects.\n\nMore from the Washington Examiner:\n\n\u201cI think the whole thing is boring,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, 29, said Thursday at the Queens Library event. \u201cHe should have been impeached a long time ago. I\u2019m over it. And so that\u2019s how I feel about it because we\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez is a breakout star of the House Democratic freshman class, which helped give the party its first majority in eight years. She got to Congress by beating a member of the House Democratic leadership in her 2018 primary challenge. \u2026 \u201cImpeachment of this president is the short-term action we need to preserve our democracy,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said at the town hall. \u201cBut if we are really going to thrive as a country, we need to make long-term investments and keep our eyes on the prize of social and economic and racial justice in the United States of America. And that\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d\n\nAOC\u2019s nothing if not a big-picture kind of gal. She\u2019s all about keeping things in perspective, that one.\n\nsmh millennial attention spans. \u2014 trick-or-treater (@neontaster) October 4, 2019", "description": "AOC", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Pm On October", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ocasio-2241e2a1-981e-4908-ada9-72e6ebe5c1cc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
