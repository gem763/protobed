Sunday evening brings us the pick of the weekend, live on Sky Sports, in the form of Manchester United vs Liverpool. The long-standing rivals have had very different starts to the season, but this one is always fiery and is set to be a thriller.\n\nIn truth Liverpool are huge favourites, especially given United's injury woes, and another side-story to the main event is the future of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. An embarrassing defeat here is only going to take him a step closer to the sack.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's future will look very bleak if United get heavily beaten at Liverpool\n\n2) It's all eyes on Matty Longstaff at Stamford Bridge this weekend, as he will be hoping to continue his fine form on the Premier League stage. The Newcastle youngster scored on his debut against United last time out, and next up is Chelsea.\n\nAs Sportsmail revealed earlier in the week, the Magpies are set to offer him a new contract, and he will be desperate to net again, against a second big club.\n\nMatty Longstaff will be hoping to continue his dream start to life in the top flight at Chelsea\n\n3) Manchester City head south to Selhurst Park in the televised match on Saturday evening. Usually, that'd be a guaranteed three points for Pep Guardiola and Co, but there are a number of reasons why Crystal Palace could cause an upset.\n\nLast season, Palace beat City at the Etihad, and the season before that they should have beaten them again at Selhurst were it not for Luka Milivojevic's missed penalty in the 90th minute of their 0-0 draw. A couple of seasons prior to that, they did beat them at home.\n\nPalace aren't a bogey side as such for City, but they've certainly had their number on a few different occasions, and with Roy Hodgson's men in fine form and much-improved at home, who knows what'll happen under the lights in south London.\n\nAndros Townsend's volley at Manchester City helped Palace to an unlikely win last season\n\n4) Tottenham and Watford face off on Saturday afternoon in what is essentially the movable object meeting the stoppable force. That's right, both of these sides have been rubbish so far this season... but something's got to give.\n\nFor both sides, it represents a brilliant opportunity to sort themselves out. Under Quique Sanchez Flores, Watford have won just one of their matches - in the League Cup - while Mauricio Pochettino's future is in doubt with Spurs struggling down in ninth place.\n\nThe game is at Tottenham, making them the favourties, but both will be absolutely desperate to add three points to their season's tally.\n\nTottenham are in disarray and it's all eyes on Mauricio Pochettino's side on Saturday afternoon\n\n5) Liverpool can create a little piece of history if they beat Manchester United on Sunday evening. If they overthrow their rivals at Old Trafford, they will equal the all-time top-flight win record set by Manchester City back in 2017.\n\nThat's a ridiculous 18 in a row... and they'll further solidify their position at the top of the league table. Just a couple of months into the season, they've been brilliant to watch and look mightily impressive.\n\nLiverpool left it late against Leicester, but they can now make it 18 wins in a row against United\n\n6) Quite simply, there's no more international football. Come on, we're all thinking it. Sometimes it's great watching your country, but there's nothing like a good round of Premier League football.\n\nThere's so many talking points - this season especially with the introduction of VAR - and there's no danger of falling asleep on the sofa. With the likes of Georgia 0-0 Republic of Ireland and Liechtenstein 1-1 Armenia, that wasn't exactly the case.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's 0-0 draw away in Georgia is unlikely to live long in the memory\n\n7) Is the Pukki party back on? Finland's main man had been on something of a Premier League goal drought after his incredible start to the season. He had eight goals in seven for club and country at the start of the campaign, but then went into a run of three without scoring, with Norwich losing every one of them.\n\nNow though, he's back in the goals after netting twice against Armenia on Tuesday, and Norwich fans will hope that he's rediscovered that scoring form that had everyone talking about him back in August and September.\n\nTeemu Pukki was back in the goals on Tuesday, and Norwich fans will be excited for his return\n\n8) Another player with plenty of eyes on him is Anthony Martial, back for Manchester United and ready to shine. He's been out since the end of August, but will be back in the line-up to face Liverpool on Sunday evening.\n\nAlthough it's been a tough start to the season for Solskjaer's men, fans can take solace from the fact that no Liverpool player has scored a goal from open play at Old Trafford since Christian Benteke's overhead kick on Martial's debut in September 2015.\n\nAnthony Martial is back and ready to face Liverpool - a team he has a good record against\n\n9) Arsenal have a brilliant opportunity to further consolidate their spot in the top four and close the gap on Manchester City when they face Sheffield United on Monday night.\n\nPlenty are keen to see how the Gunners fare in Yorkshire, given their dreadful away form. They've only won away from the Emirates once this season - on the opening day - but there will be few better opportunities than this week to change that. Depending on results elsewhere, Unai Emery's side can go second.\n\nUnai Emery's Arsenal can go second in the league, but they need to sort out their away form\n\n10) Everton kick off the weekend against West Ham with Marco Silva facing the sack. He's reportedly got three games to save his job and this is the first. It's a really exciting way to start the Premier League weekend, although we're sure Silva would rather he could fly under the radar a little.\n\nThe Toffees currently occupy a spot in the top flight relegation zone after four straight defeats, and perhaps even more worryingly, the fixtures had been relatively kind to them early on. Silva needs a win here.", "description": "Club football is back with a bang, and there are a whole host of brilliant top-flight games to whet your appetite.
