Don\u2019t stop believin\u2019. Photo: HBO\n\nConsider the band T-shirt. A wearable way to advertise your musical taste, these garments nonetheless have their good uses and their not-so-good ones. Everyone knows the shibboleth against wearing a band\u2019s T-shirt to their own concert: It\u2019s a bit obvious, a bit on-the-nose, a bit too much of a good thing. But intent matters, and wearing a band T-shirt to spread the word about an artist you love and want to share with others is a different story. And sometimes, it just looks good and fits right.\n\nWhen it comes to movies and on TV, much the same can be said about music itself. Films and shows frequently slip on songs like fans slip on T-shirts, using them to convey how they wish to be seen. The right song at the right moment can heighten the emotional impact of a scene. It can add a layer of irony or metacommentary to a moment. It can simply make you bang your head or shake your ass where appropriate.\n\nToday, the use of preexisting pop in movies and television has become, if not more common, then at least more complicated. As record sales dry up, music licensing becomes a bigger part of any act\u2019s revenue stream, and streaming platforms in particular learn to algorithmically target their wares to particular demographics. So there\u2019s a lot riding on what your 1986-set high-school dance sequence sticks on the turntable \u2014 including your own artistic credibility as a filmmaker or showrunner. Do it right and you can craft a scene or sequence that\u2019s way more than the sum of its audiovisual parts. Do it wrong and you\u2019ve taken a cheap shortcut to your viewer\u2019s heartstrings.\n\nSo before you drop that needle \u2014 or before you commence your next period-comedy binge-watch \u2014 give our list of music-cue dos and don\u2019ts a spin.\n\nDO: Use well-known songs in unexpected ways that still resonate with the original intent.\n\nRecorded pseudonymously under the Derek & the Dominos moniker, \u201cLayla\u201d is Eric Clapton\u2019s finest moment as a songwriter \u2014 an admittedly low bar to clear, since nearly all his best stuff was written by Jack Bruce, George Harrison, or JJ Cale, and also Duane Allman\u2019s contribution to the song should not be underestimated. But still! It\u2019s an outpouring of unrequited love for Pattie Boyd, the wife of his best friend and frequent collaborator Harrison, a way for this guy to reforge his broken heart into a merciless series of interlocking riffs and shout-sung choruses. It concludes with a movement that\u2019s as gentle as the body of the song is frenzied, though it\u2019s no less desperate-sounding for that.\n\nNaturally, Martin Scorsese used it to soundtrack the discovery of half a dozen dead bodies.\n\nWhy does it work in GoodFellas? Because it gets right at the heart of the mournful, elegiac feel of the original without simply rehashing its overt emotional content. No one is heartbroken over finding poor Frankie Carbone frozen solid inside a meat truck, except perhaps Mrs. Carbone. But there\u2019s still a sense that something has been lost, that the promised happy ending will never arrive.\n\nMore than that, \u201cLayla\u201d plays the same role in Clapton\u2019s career that the murders that result in this sequence play in the career of Robert De Niro\u2019s Jimmy Conway. The song is Slowhand\u2019s masterpiece, and the Lufthansa heist, literally the biggest robbery in American history at the time, was Jimmy the Gent\u2019s. Both Jimmy and Eric were at the top of their very different games here.\n\nPut it all together and it\u2019s a complex, captivating song choice that elevates both the scene it accompanies and the song itself, without the former relying on the latter to do all the dirty work. Scorsese\u2019s library is full of this kind of music cue \u2014as is GoodFellas itself.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n\u2022 Fargo, \u201cWar Pigs\u201d by Black Sabbath\n\n\u2022 American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, \u201cEasy Lover\u201d by Philip Bailey and Phil Collins\n\nDON\u2019T: Use well-known songs in exactly the way they\u2019re best known for being used.\n\nThe most common sin committed by soundtracks these days, particularly on television or in serialized film franchises, is \u201cjust not trying very hard.\u201d And to an extent, who can be blamed for that? Life is hard, and sometimes you\u2019re a filmmaker who just wants to drop a mega-jam you completely adore on your grateful public. I get that, I do. I\u2019m just asking people to reconsider.\n\nTake Legion. It\u2019s a journey into the mega-powerful, mega-fractured mind of a peripheral X-Men character, tinged with retro-futuristic \u201970s design and pull-out-the-stops visual-effects psychedelia. This ought to make it less inclined to play the first bona fide song from the best-selling psychedelic album of all time over one of said psychedelic \u201970s mind journeys, not less.\n\nAnd yet!\n\nWhat does Legion gain from playing Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cBreathe\u201d and \u201cOn the Run\u201d during one of its telepathic main character\u2019s induced dissociations? That is, what does its presence tell you, emotionally or intellectually or aesthetically, that you couldn\u2019t learn otherwise? That Legion is trippy? We know that already. That Floyd fuckin\u2019 rules? We know that already, too.\n\nThis combination of show and soundtrack isn\u2019t a combination at all, really. Juxtaposing the song and the visuals neither compounds the effects of both nor reveals something new about either. It\u2019s just one stacked on top of the other, for no better reason than the idea behind the Laser Floyd show at your local planetarium: It\u2019s bitchin\u2019, man. At least stoners who play The Dark Side of the Moon and watch The Wizard of Oz at the same time get something that not only reveals potentially hidden meaning to the music but also speaks to the nature of fantasy narratives. Those bong-water impresarios are using the music in a more innovative and artful way than a major television production.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n\u2022 The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, \u201cYou Don\u2019t Own Me\u201d by Lesley Gore\n\n\u2022 Mindhunter, \u201cPsycho Killer\u201d by Talking Heads\n\nDO: Dive for deep cuts, obscurities, and forgotten bops of yesteryear\n\nCrate-diggers of the world (who are also directors or music supervisors), unite! Busting out songs beloved, or even merely beknownst, to few people other than yourself \u2014 at least relative to the likes of \u201cLayla\u201d or \u201cBreathe\u201d \u2014 is a win-win proposition. Yes, you have to do it well, but that\u2019s a truism; you have to cast good actors and write good dialogue and hire a good cinematographer too. Whether it\u2019s a deep cut by a well-known artist or a one-hit wonder\u2019s forgotten claim to fame, you can use it to give a song a second life and inject new life into your film or show all at once.\n\nThe past master of this is Quentin Tarantino. You think anyone was blasting insanely technically proficient surf-rock jams at parties in 1994 before Pulp Fiction kicked off with Dick Dale\u2019s \u201cMisirlou\u201d? Or that the masses knew Kool & the Gang for more than just \u201cCelebration,\u201d all those years removed from their unbeatable funk glory days, before \u201cMisirlou\u201d segued right into \u201cJungle Boogie\u201d? Say what you will about Tarantino now that we\u2019re about 15 years into his baroque period, but his voracious ear for music of all eras and genres, and his knack for using it like the sonic equivalent of special effects \u2014 kicking up the action, intensity, and overall Tarantino movie-overload vibe \u2014 is basically unbeatable.\n\nBut songs don\u2019t have to have faded into obscurity, or never emerged from it to begin with, to work in this way.\n\nPrior to its use in the finale of The Sopranos, Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d was no one\u2019s idea of a lost classic \u2014 it wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s idea of a classic, lost or otherwise. \u201cClassic\u201d in the sense of \u201cclassic rock radio\u201d? Okay. \u201cClassic\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s considered one of the top anthems in the history of rock music? Friends, it was fucking Journey, not Jimi. But David Chase recognized that going with something well respected, like \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Tony Soprano\u2019s fellow New Jerseyite Bruce Springsteen (Silvio Dante\u2019s other Boss), would bury the scene beneath the song\u2019s accrued cultural weight. Going in a more original direction paid dividends for the scene, the show, and ultimately Journey themselves, whose best song finally found the respect it probably deserved all along.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n\u2022 Too Old to Die Young, \u201cHomicide\u201d by 999\n\n\u2022 The Americans, \u201cWe Do What We\u2019re Told (Milgrim\u2019s 37)\u201d by Peter Gabriel\n\nDON\u2019T: Play the hits of yesterday just to say \u201cHey, remember when?\u201d\n\nThe same year Pulp Fiction did what Pulp Fiction did, Forrest Gump did what Forrest Gump did and won Best Picture for it. And what did its soundtrack do, you ask? It found more ways to say \u201cPlaying the Hits of the \u201950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s\u201d than the commercial-free lunch hour on an oldies radio station.\n\nSeriously, look at this thing: \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son,\u201d \u201cRespect,\u201d \u201cRainy Day Women #12 & 35,\u201d \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019,\u201d \u201cFor What It\u2019s Worth,\u201d \u201cBreak On Through,\u201d \u201cMrs. Robinson\u201d (that\u2019s right, a song from another soundtrack!), \u201cVolunteers,\u201d \u201cGet Together,\u201d \u201cSan Francisco,\u201d \u201cTurn! Turn! Turn!,\u201d \u201cAquarius/Let the Sunshine In\u201d \u2014 track upon imagination-free track of not only the biggest songs of each respective era but the ones that are most definitively of that era, particularly the \u201960s. Not the real \u201960s, which were as varied and fascinating a time period as any from a musical, cultural, and political perspective. The Time-Life \u201960s, the Freedom Rock \u201960s, the Hippie Halloween costume \u201960s. It\u2019s a version of the decade just as rote in its throwback button-pushing as the film itself. The fact that Gump treats the counterculture from which these songs sprang as a boogeyman shows how little thought went into the selections, and how little connection the soundtrack has to the movie in general beyond \u201cRemember when?\u201d\n\nNow that Forrest Gump is the product of a decade that is itself viewed through the gloopy Vaseline-smeared lens of nostalgia, it has heirs that do what it did with the same sledgehammer subtlety. Captain Marvel does for female alt-rock and R&B artists of Generation X, for example, what Gump did to the protest musicians of their boomer predecessors: slap a bunch of their best-known shit together and call it a day, sanitizing the work those acts did to chip away at the stultifying templates available to women in music at the time in service of a movie about a super-soldier turned space cop. (The fact that Carol Danvers was not even on the planet during the period in which these songs were popular adds insult to injury.)\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n\u2022 Anything in a show or movie for grown-ups that reminds you of George Thorogood\u2019s \u201cBad to the Bone\u201d in The Parent Trap.\n\nDO: Play the hits of yesterday if they say something specific about your characters.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way! Some period series \u2014 The Get Down, The Americans, Halt and Catch Fire, and The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story \u2014 are far more selective and astute in the songs they picked to represent their respective eras. They pay attention to what characters would be listening to. They use songs specific enough to those characters to say something about their lives.\n\nDespite being set largely in the \u201990s, Versace relied on \u201980s hits, because they were from serial killer Andrew Cunanan\u2019s teenage years, when people\u2019s taste in music tends to crystalize. Halt and Catch Fire gave a great deal of thought to what its four idiosyncratic leads would have been into at different moments in their lives and usually avoided massive hits in the process. And as a person who got picked on by lacrosse players for most of my adolescence, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but Lady Bird made a bold and worthwhile choice by making \u201cCrash Into Me\u201d by Dave Matthews Band a linchpin song. Love it or hate it, it soundtracked a lot of basically normal kids\u2019 adolescence, and using it instead of, say, \u201cFake Plastic Trees\u201d may have lost the main character some street cred but earned the film a lot more artistic stature in the process.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n\u2022 Halt and Catch Fire, \u201cVelouria\u201d by the Pixies\n\n\u2022 Twin Peaks: The Return, \u201cI\u2019ve Been Loving You Too Long\u201d by Otis Redding\n\nDON\u2019T: Misinterpret a gigantically popular song that\u2019s famous for being misinterpreted for the sake a surface-level nostalgia hit\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nRemember when Stranger Things used \u201cEvery Breath You Take\u201d by the Police as a love song? Just a straight-up, first-kiss, puppy-love, high-school-dance love song. A song that gets a legion of YouTube commenters to say \u201cMILEVEN FOREVER!\u201d It\u2019s not hard to imagine why the Duffer brothers seized on \u201cEvery Breath You Take\u201d as the final needle-drop of season two of the series, seeing as how Billboard ranks it as the 31st most popular song of all time. Yet despite sounding intimate and romantic and yearning and all that good stuff, it\u2019s creepy as hell \u2014 according to Sting, the guy who wrote and sang it.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a nasty little song, really rather evil. It\u2019s about jealousy and surveillance and ownership,\u201d said Sting as reported in a Financial Times piece on the first page of the song\u2019s Google results. \u201cIt sounds like a comforting love song, [but] I didn\u2019t realize at the time how sinister it is,\u201d he says in an interview from the Independent quoted in the Wikipedia article. \u201cI think I was thinking of Big Brother, surveillance and control.\u201d The Sopranos \u2014 maybe you\u2019ve heard of it? \u2014 mashed it up with the Henry Mancini theme from the spy show Peter Gunn to soundtrack the FBI\u2019s attempt to bug Tony\u2019s house. This is not an obscure point to make!\n\nTo give Stranger Things at least some credit, at the end of the scene, when \u201cEBYT\u201d has been used to accompany the big emotional-climax moment for multiple couples among the teenage cast, it does fade out into the creepy sounds of the Upside Down, where the Mind Flayer continues to loom and lurk menacingly over the kids. So at the very least, the Duffers thought to say, \u201cHey, you know who else is watching them??\u201d In other words, once they got finished using the song straightforwardly, they did excavate its creepier side \u2014 but only after mining it for all the throwback school-dance pathos they could. They let the surface-level reading of the song prevail until the final possible moment.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a lot of egregiously bad needle-dropping out there, up to and including, like, jeans commercials that turn \u201cFortunate Son\u201d into a patriotic anthem and what have you. But it\u2019s worth paying attention to the dance sequence from Stranger Things specifically, because this particular sync is just a symptom of a bigger problem.\n\nWhich brings us to David Lee Roth, as all paths eventually must. As far as rock myths and legends from the 1980s go, the \u201cno brown M&Ms\u201d clause in Van Halen\u2019s tour rider is right up there with, well, the fact that \u201cEvery Breath You Take\u201d is actually really creepy. But demanding that concert venues carefully weed out the brown ones from Eddie, Alex, Mike, and Diamond Dave\u2019s \u201cmunchies\u201d served a larger purpose: Van Halen had an elaborate tour production that could be very dangerous, to the band, the audience, and the crew alike, if it wasn\u2019t set up properly and some kind of mishap or malfunction took place. If Roth noticed brown M&Ms backstage, he reasoned, it was a distinct possibility that the venue had screwed up other, much more important details as well.\n\nSame thing applies to Stranger Things and \u201cEvery Breath You Take.\u201d A show that can screw up the use of a song in such an infamously common way will probably screw up other songs in other ways: using a mournful song by a comparatively obscure British postpunk/goth band whose lead singer committed suicide before its release to accompany characters from a small town in the American Midwest mourning for a character who is very obviously still alive, for example, or picking the most obvious Big \u201980s hits imaginable and using them in the most bog-standard, straightforward ways imaginable.\n\nAnd this problem won\u2019t stop at the Hawkins town line. The more TV \u2014streaming in particular \u2014 becomes a series of microtargeted systems, the more \u201cOh shit, that was my jam!\u201d will become the be-all and end-all of period music on soundtracks. It\u2019s Stranger Things Syndrome, time after time.\n\nOther, better shows and movies try harder. They use pop to communicate things pictures and dialogue can\u2019t do alone, and they add those pictures and dialogue to communicate something pop can\u2019t do alone. Can yours be one of them? Don\u2019t stop believin\u2019.", "description": "The music used in a scene can result in something bigger than the sum of its parts, or it can be a cheap shortcut to viewers\u2019 heartstrings.
