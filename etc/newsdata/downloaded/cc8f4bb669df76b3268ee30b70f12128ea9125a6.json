Ferrer was released after three days.\n\n\u201cWe are in the presence of a new wave of repression,\u201d Ferrer said.", "description": "International rights groups this week denounced Communist-run Cuba's arrest of dissident journalist Roberto Quinones after what they say was a sham trial, while local opposition activists complained of worsening harassment.", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
