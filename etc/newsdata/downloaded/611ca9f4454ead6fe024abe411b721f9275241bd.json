This was the seventh series in league history that had gone to a deciding Game 5, and the home team has won five of them.\n\nDelle Donne, who has been dealing with a herniated disk in her back, scored four points during a decisive 8-0 run that gave the Mystics an 80-72 lead with under three minutes left. But it was Meesseman, the soft-spoken Belgian who unveiled a new, aggressive \"Playoff Emma\" persona during the title run, who was named MVP of the Finals.\n\nMeesseman missed last season while playing with the Belgian national team.\n\n\"I don't think I'm the missing piece. I'm their teammate [and did what] I need to do help my team win a championship. This is my family right here,\" she said.\n\nCHAMPIONS! \ud83c\udfc6 <br><br>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WashMystics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WashMystics</a> win their first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WNBA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WNBA</a> title in franchise history! \ud83d\udc4f <a href=\"https://t.co/uBQEK3rGGf\">pic.twitter.com/uBQEK3rGGf</a> \u2014@WNBA Delle Donne came to Washington three years ago in a trade from Chicago, hoping to get the Mystics their first title. She grew up about an hour from the city in Delaware and wanted to be closer to home. She's been battling injuries and illnesses all season, breaking her nose early in the year. She still wears a mask to protect it. Delle Donne also wears a knee brace on her right knee after suffering a bone bruise in last year's Finals.\n\nThe victory gave coach Mike Thibault his first WNBA championship. The league's all-time winningest coach had reached the Finals three times in his career \u2014 twice with Connecticut \u2014 and last season with Washington, but fell short each time.\n\nThe game got off to a slow start with choppy play, but it picked up during a back-and-forth second half.\n\nThe Mystics trailed by nine midway through the third quarter before rallying within two at the end of the period. The teams traded the lead in the final period until Delle Donne hit a tough fadeaway midway through the quarter. After a Connecticut miss, Kristi Toliver \u2014 the only player on either team who had won a title before \u2014 drove down the lane and hit a beautiful finger-roll layup to give the Mystics a 76-72 lead.\n\nDelle Donne added another basket, and Meesseman capped the run with a jumper.\n\n\"Emma went to work inside. Elena does what she does. You have to beat them by defending them. All the players stepped up in the fourth quarter when we needed it,\" Thibault said.\n\nConnecticut could only get within six points the rest of the way.\n\n\"They were just better down the stretch,\" Sun coach Curt Miller said. \"Defensively, it wasn't anything more than they were really physical. They were the physical team down the stretch when they needed it.\"\n\nDelle Donne grabs final rebound\n\nDelle Donne got the final rebound and hugged her teammates at centre court as the final buzzer sounded.\n\nJonquel Jones had 25 points for the Sun and Alyssa Thomas added 21 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nDelle Donne said the team was aware that the only thing missing from its coach's resume was the championship and was thrilled to help give him his first.\n\n\"He's created such a family atmosphere here that the least we could do is win a title for him,\" she said.\n\nThe two shared a long embrace at centre court as confetti rained down after the game.\n\nMeesseman got rolling when the Mystics desperately needed her, with Connecticut leading by nine. She scored 11 points in the third period on array of post moves and outside shots to get the Mystics within 64-62 heading into the final quarter.\n\nMeesseman said her motivation was simple.\n\n\"\"The trophy,\" she said. \"It's a championship game. That's all I need. I'm just playing basketball. Today I just shot my shot.\"", "description": "League MVP Elena Delle Donne led the Washington Mystics to their first WNBA championship with a 89-78 victory against the Connecticut Sun in Game 5 of the Finals on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5317444.1570761183!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wnba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
