The rock bottom prices regime that was started by Jio had put a big dent on the profitability of telecom players. Such a consolidation resulted in many smaller players exiting this industry while Vodafone (LON: ) and Idea merged to give any competition to Bharti Airtel Ltd. (NS: ) and Jio.\n\nThe fact that only three players survived in the telecom industry is itself a testament to the point of how stiff the competition is.\n\nAirtel and Vodafone had started to get used to the low price regime in the telecom industry set by Jio when all of a sudden, Jio announced yesterday that it would get away from its free voice call promise. Jio said that it would start charging for the voice calls made to other networks at six paise per minute. In the telecom world, it is well known as the IUC or the interconnect usage charge.\n\nBy reneging from its promise to keep voice calls free for life, Jio has now taken a significant risk of customer defections. Jio may be able to grow its revenues through this move, but it may hurt its market share.\n\nOnly time will tell how this decision will impact Jio, but it is good news for Airtel and Vodafone. It allows them to poach customers from Jio by advertising that Jio failed to hold on to its promise of giving free calls to its customers for a lifetime. Users had got used to the free calls offered by Jio, and this news has come as a shock to them.\n\nOn paper, this decision from Jio is understandable since the majority of Jio\u2019s total traffic was outgoing as free calls from Jio enabled users of other networks to give missed calls to Jio users. This was the main reason why Jio continued to be a net payer of the IUC charges to the other operators.\n\nBy applying IUC charges, Jio can recover these losses and may even encourage users from other networks to migrate to Jio to avoid the IUC charges. Jio to Jio calls will still be free. Hence it is too early to gauge how this decision will impact Jio.\n\nThese are interesting times in the telecom industry, but yesterday\u2019s news signals that the tariff war is finally coming to an end. Telecom players can now hope for a return of profitability, which will also allow them to invest in new technologies such as 5G. This is also good news for shareholders in general, and we could see some buying interest in select telecom stocks today.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Vodafone Group PLC, Bharti Airtel Ltd., Reliance Industries Ltd.
