Anonymous\n\nPimples are the worst! They hurt, pop up overnight and can be impossible to hide. You\u2019re right that oily skin is believed to be the most critical factor for causing acne.\n\nBut rest assured, there are a few things you can do to keep your oil at bay and control the likelihood of a break out.\n\nWhy am I so oily\u2026 all the time!\n\nBefore we start talking about how to avoid acne, let\u2019s chat about why oily skin causes acne.\n\nOily skin is caused by the overproduction of sebum by an overactive oil gland (also known as the pilosebaceous unit, which is just a fancy term for a hair follicle and its oil gland).\n\nThere are a few reasons we get acne, one being the pore of the oil gland can be blocked \u2013 this can be made worse by using certain types of makeup.\n\nSome of our hormones during puberty drive sebum overproduction, hence acne-overload. Fun fact: anabolic steroids, typically used by bodybuilders, can trigger acne too.\n\nAcne bacteria lives on the skin and its overgrowth around your oil glands can worsen inflammation and pus formation. This is what causes acne to hurt sometimes.\n\nIf there\u2019s a strong history of acne in your family, there\u2019s a good chance you might get it too.\n\nIt is also linked to medical conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome.\n\nTrust me on this, a proper skin routine is everything\n\nAs a dermatologist, I recommend cleaning your face every morning and evening. If you wear make up, ALWAYS wipe it off before going to bed \u2013 no excuses!", "description": "There are few things worse then oily skin - especially when it leads to a painful pimple.
