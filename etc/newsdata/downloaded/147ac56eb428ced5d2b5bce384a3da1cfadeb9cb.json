The fate of the nursing homes and their residents is now in question.\n\nThe ruling comes from the Holy See\u2019s Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, which oversees religious orders and institutes, led by Cardinal Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz. Previous attempts by the sisters to overturn the congregation\u2019s rulings against them by appealing to the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura have failed, with the court reportedly dismissing their case without allowing them to fully present their arguments.\n\n\u201cHaving looked to remaining faithful, as much to the Church as to the charism granted by Our Lord to Mother Marie de la Croix, having tried to find, many many times, a path of dialogue with Rome, having offered peaceful solutions, no agreement having been found, the authorities in Rome in charge of the Consecrated Life have now decided to choose to release us from our religious vows,\u201d the sisters announced on June 3, following the issuance of the decision on May 23.\n\n\u201cWhilst it is true that in the context of the moral pressure and the impasse that we found ourselves in, we were driven, last October, against our profound wishes, to ask to be released from our vows, since no other solution had ever been offered to enable us to remain in communion with the Church: we are profoundly wounded by this and remain sadly surprised that Rome has preferred to accept that request rather than accepting the peaceful solutions which we had put forward and which were possible,\u201d the sisters added.\n\nThe lay-led Association in Support of the Little Sisters denounced the decision as a \u201cgrievous injustice\u201d and blamed the bishop of the Diocese of Laval, Thierry Scherrer, for a personal vendetta against the group\u2019s conservative mother superior that has now led to the destruction of the order.\n\n\u201cMgr Scherrer wanted the head of the Superior General on a platter,\u201d wrote the association. \u201cAn entire Congregation has been destroyed!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis unjust and violent decision gives rise to grave damage both moral and material to the Little Sisters of Mary who have given their lives in the service of the Church, in perfect fidelity to their religious vocation,\u201d they add.\n\n\u201cAuthoritarianism\u201d and \u201cmoral harassment\u201d from Church authorites led to destruction\n\nThe nuns were also reportedly under attack by the archbishop of Toulouse, Robert Le Gall, who prohibited one of the nuns\u2019 houses from attending their more traditional form of Mass in their community chapel, apparently following their refusal to participate in Le Gall\u2019s mass at the nursing home chapel due to their rejection of his liturgical practices.\n\nAccording to their lay supporters, the sisters were accused of a variety of offenses against modern sensibilities, including engaging in \u201ctoo much prayer,\u201d the use of the traditional habits, \u201cdeviant authoritarianism,\u201d being \u201ctoo classical\u201d in their thinking, and being \u201cunmoving\u201d in their adherence to the charism of their institute. They also say the commissioners tried to turn the sisters against each other, offering prestigious positions in the order if they would conform to the commissioner\u2019s authority, but their tactics failed. When the nuns refused to admit the commissioners, they were threatened with excommunication and requested to be relieved of their vows to avoid that outcome.\n\nThe sisters\u2019 support association is threatening to undertake legal measures against those who have brought about the destruction of the institute as an act of \u201cmoral harassment,\u201d which is actionable under French law. The association promised that \u201cas a matter of justice legitimate actions will be undertaken against those responsible, whatever their involvement, to obtain redress and to reveal the entire truth about this affair.\u201d\n\nThe support association says the decision to relieve the sisters of their vows instead of working out a solution with them came at the behest of Sr. Genevi\u00e8ve M\u00e9devielle, the principal apostolic commissioner named by the Vatican. M\u00e9devielle is a religious sister who dresses in lay clothing and wears a short haircut without a head covering. She is a professor of ethics at the Catholic Institute of Paris and the author of the recently published book Migrants, Francis, and us. M\u00e9devielle writes in defense of Amoris Laetitia against \u201cconservatives and traditionalists\u201d who criticize it.\n\nThe French Catholic newspaper La Croix further reported yesterday that the sisters \u201ctoday are threatening Sister Genevi\u00e8ve Medevielle with a lawsuit for moral harassment.\u201d\n\nSr. Genevi\u00e8ve M\u00e9devielle\n\n\u201cIt was with an authoritarianism and in a context of moral harassment, initiated by the Bishop of Laval, Mgr Scherrer, that the ecclesiastical authorities preferred to reduce the Little Sisters of Mary the Redeemer to the lay state, on 23rd May 2019, rather than opting for a peaceful solution, repeatedly proposed by the Little Sisters, but never really considered by the Congregation in Rome!\u201d the support association declares on its website.\n\nOur suffering enables us to live our vocation more fully, say sisters\n\nThe sisters, for their part, say they will continue to live their life of prayer and see their suffering as enabling them to live their vocation even more deeply.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we have not lived through these two sorrowful years in order to lose the treasure which is for us the charism received from Mother Marie de la Croix. We want to continue to live together, in a life of prayer and service. Ecce!\u201d the sisters write.\n\n\u201cParadoxically and mysteriously, we live perhaps more than ever perhaps what is at the heart of our vocation: following in the way of Our Lady, to take our part of suffering in the fulfilment of the plan of our Redemption, in reparation, for the saving of souls, for the sanctification of priests, for the Church so damaged by all sorts of scandals, for the world. If Christ, our souls\u2019 spouse, judges us worthy of carrying such a Cross, we must render thanks to him, in all things.\u201d\n\nRequests for comment from the Holy See were not answered by publication time.\n\nArticle first appeared at: https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/vatican-all-but-wipes-out-conservative-order-of-nuns-for-too-much-prayer", "description": "", "authors": ["Kevin Edward White"], "top_image": "https://catholiccitizens.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/little_sisters_of_mary_france_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-08"}
