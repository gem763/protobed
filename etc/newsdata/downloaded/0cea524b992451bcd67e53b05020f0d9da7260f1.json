(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nCiting recent civic unrest, Chilean President Sebastian Pi\u00f1era announced during a Wednesday news conference that Chile will cancel the upcoming APEC and COP25 international summits.\n\nThe announcement throws a wrench into a planned meeting between President Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping over the \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal announced earlier this month between the U.S. and China.\n\n\u201cWe understand perfectly the importance of APEC and COP for Chile and the world, but we have based our decision on common sense,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said at the presidential palace. \u201cA president needs to put its people above everything else.\u201d Pi\u00f1era also said that other world leaders had been notified to warn them of the impending cancellation.\n\n\u201cOur main concern is reestablishing public order, our citizens\u2019 security and social peace, along with pushing through a social agenda to respond to the main demands of our citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter announcing the partial deal on October 11, President Trump said the agreement would take several weeks to write and would likely be signed at the APEC summit, which was slated to run from November 16-17. Later reports implied that ironing out the deal\u2019s details would take an extra round of talks.\n\nThe provisions of the purported deal include $40 to $50 billion in Chinese purchases of American agricultural products, with further agreements on protections of American intellectual property. The White House had suspended $250 billion in tariff hikes, and suggested earlier this week that tariff exclusions could be extended through December.", "description": "The announcement throws a wrench into a planned meeting between President Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping over the \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
