Despite many of those leaking in the days leading up to the event, Microsoft managed to keep a couple of products, like the Surface Duo and Earbuds, a secret. That\u2019s a rarity these days.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about all of Microsoft\u2018s announcements in separate posts, but we know you\u2019re lazy, so we\u2019ve collected all the biggest details here. Microsoft\u2018s also amassed some snazzy trailers for each of the new gadgets too, which you can watch below.\n\nSurface Laptop 3 \u2013 including a 15-inch model\n\nWe once thought Microsoft would never make a \u2018normal\u2019 laptop, but now the device is in its third generation. For the first time, it\u2019s available in a 15-inch size. This model uses an AMD Ryzen processor that excels at multi-thread workloads and provides stronger integrated graphics (the smaller one uses 10th-Gen Intel chips).\n\nThe 13-inch laptop comes in both fabric and metal finishes \u2013 including an attractive \u2018Sandstone\u2019 that\u2019s kind of a gold with a slightly rosy tint. The 15-inch model is only available in metal finishes, black, and silver.\n\nThere\u2019s finally USB-C on board! Battery life is rated at 11.5 hours of typical usage, and though Microsoft still uses the Surface Connect port, the laptops now support fast charging, providing an 80 percent charge in an hour.\n\nPrice: $999+ (13.5-inch), $1,199+ (15-inch)\n\nWhen: Pre-order now, releases October 22\n\nSurface Pro 7\n\nIt may not be the biggest news of the day, but the classic Surface Pro hasn\u2019t been forgotten. It features similar specs to the 13.5-inch Surface Laptop 3, with 10th Gen intel chips and Iris Plus graphics. It\u2019s equipped with higher quality \u2018Studio Mics\u2019 and claims to offer 10.5 hours of battery life, with fast charging. The type cover comes in snazzy new shades of red and blue, and USB-C is here too.\n\nPrice: $749+ (without keyboard)\n\nWhen: Pre-order now, releases October 22\n\nSurface Pro X\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Surface Pro X \u2013 this is the device that elevates the Surface Pro form factor to new levels. It\u2019s ridiculously thin at just 5.33mm, with seriously slimmed bezels that are just a few millimeters thick on the sides; the device packs a 13-inch screen in the chassis of a 12-inch device. It uses a custom \u2018SQ1 processor designed by Microsoft and Qualcomm, claimed to be the latter\u2019s fastest PC processor yet, and is available in an LTE configuration as well.\n\nMicrosoft also finally found a good spot to store the Surface Pen: in the Type Cover. The new flat stylus lives in a little nook at above the keyboard, neatly concealed when the tablet is closed or the keyboard is used in its angled position. There are two USB-C ports on deck, and because of the efficient ARM architecture, the tablet claims to deliver 13 hours of battery life with typical use \u2013 despite a slim chassis.\n\nPrice: $999+\n\nWhen: Pre-order now, available November 5\n\nSurface Earbuds\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t be surprised, but Microsoft is making true wireless earbuds too. The Surface Buds are kind of a cross between Apple\u2019s AirPods and Google\u2019s Pixel buds, except with a gigantic touch surface.\n\nThat means intuitive controls that actually let you perform all the actions you expect from a pair of headphones, including changing the volume and skipping tracks without pulling out your phone or using voice commands (this is surprisingly uncommon among true wireless headphones). Despite the large disc, I found them comfortable.\n\nTheir main selling point, however, is tight Office integration, allowing you to access information from Office, swipe through slides, use real-time translation, and dictate documents (aside from all the usual assistant stuff). The earbuds provide a total of 24 hours of battery life \u2013 eight in the buds themselves, and another two charges in the surprisingly svelte carrying case.\n\nPrice: $249\n\nWhen: \u201cLater this year\u201d\n\nWindows 10X\n\nNo, Windows 10X is not Windows 10\u2019s successor. Instead, it\u2019s Microsoft\u2018s latest attempt at making its OS more friendly to mobile devices. This time, it seems the company might have a chance of succeeding.\n\nWindows 10X works basically just like regular Windows, however, it is significantly optimized for use with mobile devices \u2013 and folding devices or dual-screen devices in particular. It only loads the components of Windows necessary for what you\u2019re doing in order to save battery \u2013 always the bugbear with mobile devices.\n\nWhen: Fall 2020\n\nSurface Neo\n\nThe Surface Neo has been a long time coming. Rumored as \u2018Project Centaurus\u2019 since last year, the device is really an evolution of the \u2018Courier\u2019 concept first detailed over a decade ago. It has the potential to redefine PC form factors, the way the original Surface did so many years ago.\n\nRather than embracing flexible screen technology, Microsoft was clear it believes delineating two separate screens is a good thing. It helps us keep our mind on getting things done, and it could make the device far more durable than devices like the Galaxy Fold. Microsoft shows off smooth transition moving information between screens, and that Windows 10 X was able to adapt to whether you\u2019re using it as a dual-screen device or folded up into a slimmer form factor.\n\nMost impressive, however, is how the device integrates with its keyboard. Once you magnetically attach the keyboard to once of the displays, the interface changes to allow you to perform a multitude of actions. You can even practically use the Neo as a regular laptop, as the screen becomes a touchpad adjacent to the keyboard. Alternatively, you can use the space to play a video or save information while working on a primary task on the other display.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to put into words, so just watch Microsoft\u2019s video above for a better idea of the radical concept.\n\nPrice: Unknown, but probably lots of dough\n\nWhen: Holiday 2020\n\nSurface Duo\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve been truly surprised at a tech event, with leaks seemingly unstoppable in our ever-connected world. But though a mythical Surface Phone had been rumored for years, the latest news was that the project was indefinitely scrapped in favor of Centaurus, AKA the Neo. Even if you held out hope for a Surface Phone, no one expected it to be revealed today \u2013 much less running Android.\n\nAnd yet, the Surface Duo is real. It looks something like a mini Surface Neo, except its running Android. And like the Neo \u2013 and unlike other folding phones \u2013 the Duo has no flexible display technology. These are two separate screens, meant for running separate tasks. It looks like a phone I can actually get work done on efficiently. And it\u2019s odd to live in a world where a Microsoft device is running someone else\u2019s OS; I\u2019ll be darned if the Duo isn\u2019t the most interesting phone concept in years.\n\nI want one. Now. Too bad it isn\u2019t coming out until next year.\n\nPrice: Who knows\n\nWhen: Holiday 2020\n\nGot all that? Stay tuned for ours hands-ons with the new devices.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "Here's a quick rundown of Microsoft's exciting new hardware for the coming year, including Surface laptops, earbuds, a foldable phone, and more.", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F597d12de5f1604078c51be9c3b365e60.jpg&signature=ce9d26781ade64990a4508701638bc06", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
