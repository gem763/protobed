We already had a play kitchen which Holly loves to play with and, to be honest, I also wanted to declutter the living room!\n\n\u2018I knew Holly would love the idea as she loves he playhouse in the garden but coming into the winter months there is less time to spend outside.\u2019\n\nKaren wanted a fun new play space for Holly (Picture: Karen Adamson)\n\n37-year-old Karen then started looking for bits and bobs to make this cosy mini home for her little one. Shops like B&M and B&Q were invaluable to her for materials, with the whole thing coming in at less than \u00a3100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The stairs already had a door so, along with my partner Kevan, we made it into a house door by cutting a hole out of it, lining it with MDF and painting it white,\u2019 says the Scottish mum.\n\n\u2018We then added some brass hardware from B&Q and Amazon.\u2019\n\nThe little window adds a perfect touch (Picture: Karen Adamson)\n\nThen, for the window the pair \u2018cut a hole in the wall, lined it and made the cross part with MDF and the frame from skirting boards, all from B&Q.\u2019\n\nKaren even wallpapered for the first time ever, using a brick effect paper from B&M.\n\nIt\u2019s nicer \u2013 and bigger \u2013 than most London rentals (Picture: Karen Adamson)\n\nMiraculously, the whole thing took less than a day, with Karen and Kevan starting at around 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, and finishing everything off when Holly went to bed.\n\nHer reaction the next morning was priceless: \u2018Holly absolutely loved the playhouse when she saw it and couldn\u2019t believe it was for her.\n\nHolly was overjoyed with the cupboard\u2019s makeover (Picture: Karen Adamson)\n\nShe loves ringing the doorbell the most, much to the annoyance of our dog.\u2019\n\nIt really does look like a tiny house, and it\u2019s a much nicer way to use the space than simply storing your vacuum and winter coat.\n\nKaren also has advice for other parents thinking about attempting DIY. She says, \u2018just go for it- there are YouTube tutorials for pretty much and task and you learn as you go.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow you\u2019ve got no excuse not to get the paintbrushes and power tools out.\n\nMORE: How to work out (safely) if you\u2019re doing intermittent fasting\n\nMORE: Bride ties the knot wearing a wedding dress made of patches crafted by friends and family\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Karen Adamson created this incredible playhouse for her daughter, Holly.
