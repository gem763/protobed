At Thursday\u2019s Senate estimates hearings of the community affairs committee, Labor senator Carol Brown wanted \u201cinformation on the termination payments for the former CEO and others who left at the same time or very soon after\u201d.\n\nYou might recall that NDIA chief executive Rob de Luca resigned in April. Three of his seven direct reports \u2013 Michael Francis, Antonia Albanese and Anthony Vella \u2013 subsequently did the same. Much to the delight of NDIA-preferred head hunter Russell Reynolds!\n\nNDIA head of people Hamish Aikman (paid $481,281 in FY19) told the senator from Tasmania \u201cthere have been no termination payments related to recent senior executives who have departed the agency.\u201d\n\nAikman\u2019s unequivocal statement jars somewhat with page 134 of the NDIA\u2019s 2018-19 annual report, released on October 16, which sets out the $245,818 \u201ctermination benefits\u201d paid to one senior executive on a salary of $574,219 and another termination payment of $276,301 paid to another senior executive on a salary of $505,524.\n\nExplanatory notes reveal the duo were not key management personnel (despite being paid more than any of the CEO\u2019s direct reports), and may even have been contractors or consultants. Nevertheless, the page is headed \u201csenior executives\u201d and the table is entitled \u201cInformation about remuneration for senior executives in 2018-19\u201d, so surely should have been captured by Aikman\u2019s answer to Senator Brown\u2019s question.", "description": "What the NDIA told Senate Estimates about executive termination payments contradicts the contents of its own recent annual report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_18/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/422b21f9d49037924890ce69787c995b9f83817d", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
