And as we all now realize, this violence does not live in the past,\u201d Biden said to a mostly black crowd in a sanctuary illuminated by a stained-glass image of a black Jesus.\n\n\u201cThe same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse at 16th Street pulled the trigger in Mother Emanuel, unleashed the anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh and Poway, and saw a white supremacist gun down innocent Latino immigrants in an El Paso parking lot with military-grade weapons, declaring it would stop a quote, \u2018Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u2019 We have not relegated racism and white supremacy to the pages of history.\u201d\n\nBiden did not mention President Trump and alluded only obliquely to his own White House aspirations, but his remarks at the 16th Street Baptist Church underscore the prominent and often volatile role that race has played in this presidential campaign. Biden, who said he was motivated to enter the 2020 race after seeing the rally of Ku Klux Klan members and avowed neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, has positioned himself as a candidate who would help heal a divided nation that has never fully overcome its racist past.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 1963, KKK members planted dynamite beneath the steps of the church\u2019s basement. At 10:22 a.m., the bomb went off, killing four girls \u2014 Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley \u2014 who were changing into their choir robes.\n\nThe church had served as a meeting point for black people protesting institutionalized racism in Birmingham and the rest of the South. The bombing \u2014 one of dozens directed at black churches and homes throughout the decade in a city that was nicknamed \u201cBombingham\u201d\u2014 drew international attention to the civil rights movement.\n\nA year later, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. A year after that, the Voting Rights Act outlawed poll taxes and literacy tests that had been used across the Jim Crow South to suppress the black vote.\n\nBiden told the crowd that the bombing motivated him to leave a white-shoe law firm and become a public defender \u2014 and, ultimately, to pursue public service.\n\nThroughout the 2020 campaign, Biden has argued that he has been working on behalf of civil rights for decades, even as he has faced questions about past views opposing forced busing.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, critics have wondered aloud whether the standard-bearer of the diverse Democratic Party of the 21st century should be a 76-year-old white man, especially in a campaign field that features two prominent black senators, several women and a Latino.\n\nOther Democrats in the race contend that they are best positioned to pick up the mantle of the civil rights movement and to address the issues of black voters, a critical Democratic bloc.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has said that his administration would address the \u201cdisparities within the disparity,\u201d problems that have an outsize effect on black Americans. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has released plans, named after prominent black historical figures, that would address problems pervasive in black America.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who is black, has described himself as a child of the civil rights movement whose parents had to fight discrimination to buy a home in the all-white neighborhood where he grew up. This summer, Booker spoke at the site of another black tragedy, Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, S.C., where nine parishioners were killed by a white supremacist as they prayed.\n\nBiden and Booker have clashed over Biden\u2019s statements about his fine working relationship with segregationist senators during his first years serving in Congress.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that I very much appreciate your help during this week\u2019s Committee meeting in attempting to bring my antibusing legislation to a vote,\u201d Biden wrote on June 30, 1977, to Sen. James Eastland, who had vowed to stop whites and blacks from eating together in Washington and had once called African Americans \u201can inferior race.\u201d\n\nThe argument bled into the first Democratic presidential debate, where Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is of black and Indian descent, said Biden\u2019s early opposition to busing pained her personally, particularly because as a second-grader, she had been bused to a recently integrated school.\n\nBiden\u2019s earlier statements have resurfaced and sparked new criticism, including in the most recent debate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather,\u201d he said in 1975. \u201cI feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation. And I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\u201d\n\nBiden and his supporters have argued that the criticism levied against him is an attempt by his opponents to gain momentum by rehashing the past and that he has been a stalwart defender of civil rights.\n\nAny questions about his racial bona fides, he has said repeatedly on the stump, should be dispelled by the fact that the nation\u2019s first black president chose him as a running mate.\n\nThe criticism has not pulled black voters away from Biden. In South Carolina, a state where nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters are black, Biden has a commanding 43 percent of the vote, according to a CBS News poll in early September.\n\nBiden said at a fundraiser in Houston last week that he also is popular in Alabama, a state with a large African American population. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m the only guy to get invited to campaign in Alabama,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Birmingham, he did not mention the campaign during the church visit. Instead, he spoke with the families of the victims of the 1963 bombing and bowed his head in prayer as a wreath was placed at a memorial there.\n\nHe told the church that the nation is engaged in the same debate that the 16th Street Baptist Church has been a part of for 56 years: hatred vs. love, division vs. unity.\n\n\u201cNow hate is on the rise again, and we\u2019re at a defining moment again in American history,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWho are we? What do we want to be?\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nAfrican Americans say presidential candidates are missing basic connections", "description": "The Democratic candidate, who has faced questions about his past views against forced busing, visited the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala.", "authors": ["Cleve R.
