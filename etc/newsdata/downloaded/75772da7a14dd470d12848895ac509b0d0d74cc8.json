To counter it, he has proposed implementing universal basic income in the form of a \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d of $1,000 a month to U.S. citizens.\n\nAD\n\nSince then, Yang has exceeded expectations in the Democratic primary despite his lack of political experience, out-fundraising and outlasting several lawmakers and elected officials. Yang\u2019s campaign raised $10 million in the third quarter, more than those of several sitting senators and governors who remain in the race.\n\nAD\n\nAt the Washington Post Live event, Yang reiterated his concerns that automation and artificial intelligence would continue to eliminate American jobs, saying he believed Republicans and Democrats are wrongly focused on scapegoating other things \u2014 the former, immigrants, and the latter, bad trade deals.\n\n\u201cIf you ignore that elephant [of automation] in the room, I believe you are making a grave mistake,\u201d Yang told The Post\u2019s Robert Costa. \u201cIf we\u2019re stuck chasing immigrants or trade deals while artificial intelligence is about to lead the land, we are sunk.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs he did at the fourth Democratic debate last week, Yang lightly criticized a wealth tax \u2014 such as the one fellow candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have made pillars of their campaigns \u2014 saying it had already been tried in other countries, only to be repealed because implementation problems meant it didn\u2019t generate as much revenue as expected.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI am not conceptually against a wealth tax,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to walk us down the road that other countries have walked down and learned hard lessons from. \u2026 I would not rule it out, but it\u2019s not, to me, the first and best choice.\u201d He later praised Warren, saying he was a big fan of the senator, despite their differences.\n\nYang, who has gained some notoriety for his uniquely candid campaigning style \u2014 he once crowd-surfed at an event in California \u2014 cracked jokes while simultaneously painting a sobering picture of the perils of automation. He quipped that he was nervous before appearing on the national debate stage for the first time, before the realization that \u201cit wasn\u2019t really a debate\u201d calmed him down.\n\nAD\n\nAt points during the Washington Post Live interview, Yang demonstrated the calculated polish of a politician sidestepping a question.\n\nAD\n\nHe brushed aside concerns that some of his campaign-trail jokes \u2014 about being a hard worker or knowing a lot of doctors because he\u2019s Asian \u2014 were helping to perpetuate a \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth, saying Americans should be \u201csmart enough\u201d to know he\u2019s joking when he says such things.\n\n\u201cI think, if anything, by bringing these stereotypes into the light and poking fun at them, you\u2019re actually dispelling them and making them weaker,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI know that the Asian community is very, very diverse. And I would certainly never suggest that my experience or anyone\u2019s experience speaks for everyone in a community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen Costa asked him repeatedly if Yang supported the protests in Hong Kong, Yang demurred.\n\n\u201cI think that the Chinese response to people who are standing with the Hong Kong people, it\u2019s off base,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most Americans are deeply sympathetic to the Democratic protests in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDo you stand in solidarity with them?\u201d Costa asked again.\n\nYang paused. \u201cI think that most Americans stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong,\u201d he responded.\n\nWhen asked how he, as a 44-year-old, would differentiate himself from 37-year-old South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is campaigning on a message of generational change, Yang pointed to his proposal for universal basic income, as well as his plethora of other policies, which cover everything from protecting personal data to doing away with the penny.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think they could dig into our platforms and get a sense of our visions for the country,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI will say that everyone can see what my vision is because I have over 160 policies very clearly laid out on my website \u2026 and that vision, I believe, sets me apart not just from Pete but from every other candidate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nYang later said he would be willing to join someone else\u2019s ticket as a vice president if he ultimately did not win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019m not someone who\u2019s had some crazy, native desire to be president of the United States since I was a kid, \u2018cause I\u2019m not insane,\u201d Yang said to laughter. \u201cI\u2019m a parent. I\u2019m a patriot. I just want to help solve the problems of this era.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWithout divulging which other candidate with whom he is most closely aligned, Yang claimed, of all the Democratic presidential hopefuls, only former vice president Joe Biden had pulled him aside to talk about concerns over automation and the \u201cfourth industrial revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely open to working with Joe,\u201d Yang said in response to a question about whether he\u2019d serve as Biden\u2019s vice president. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually talked about it.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cI would never do anything that would increase the chances of Donald Trump becoming president\u201d again, Yang said at a Washington Post Live event.", "authors": ["Amy B Wang", "National Politics Reporter Covering Presidential Campaigns"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Fzpkbnbm_PSgn4Q6e1O5TAQxoZ4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DW3QHZ747BCNDK7J7QYPOYMKOU.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
