Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) office spoke to the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d before he or she filed the complaint, based on hearsay.\n\nDemocrats and deep state actors may have coordintaed the leak of U.S. withholding aid to fit the impeachment narrative. The \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d allegation is at the center of the impeachment probe.\n\nThe Times article\u2019s headline \u2014Ukraine Knew of Aid Freeze by Early August, Undermining Trump Defense \u2014 admitted that the Ukrainians did not find out about the United States holding up security assistance until days after the call.\n\nCiting Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX), Trump tweeted on Wednesday, \u201cNeither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d\n\nNeither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d Congressman John Ratcliffe @foxandfriends Where is the Whistleblower? The Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nRatcliffe was present for Taylor\u2019s deposition.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who has also witnessed the impeachment inquiry depositions, added, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard Ukraine wasn\u2019t even aware aid was being withheld until a month after the phone call.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me POTUS imposed leverage over something Ukraine didn\u2019t know about? Got it.\u201d\n\nThis is not a \u201cnew talking point\u201d\u2014we\u2019ve been emphasizing it for weeks, because it\u2019s true. We\u2019ve heard Ukraine wasn\u2019t even aware aid was being withheld until a month AFTER the phone call. So you\u2019re telling me POTUS imposed leverage over something Ukraine didn\u2019t know about? Got it https://t.co/p7d30fxlCO \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) October 23, 2019\n\nAt least two impeachment inquiry witnesses \u2014 Volker and Taylor \u2014 explicitly testified in their leaked opening remarks that Ukraine was not aware the United States was withholding aid until days after the July 25 call.\n\nTaylor noted in his remarks that Ukraine did not express concerns about the U.S. withholding aid until after the Politico published its story on the matter in late August.\n\nIt was not until September 1, more than a month after the July 25 call, that Taylor said he found out the security assistance \u201cwas conditioned on the investigations.\u201d\n\nIvan Pentchoukov, the deputy chief editor at the Epoch Times, tweeted on Thursday that Taylor told lawmakers, \u201cAmazingly, news of the hold did not leak out until August 29.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazingly, news of the hold did not leak out until August 29,\u201d William Taylor, who knew that aid to Ukraine was on hold, told lawmakers. Amazingly, Taylor met Adam Schiff's staffer in Ukraine on August 25, four days prior to Politico publishing the leak. pic.twitter.com/uZxOhL9Fao \u2014 Ivan Pentchoukov (@IvanPentchoukov) October 24, 2019\n\nRepublicans say Taylor\u2019s claim of a quid pro quo linked to Ukraine \u201ccollapsed\u201d when lawmakers questioned him during his deposition.\n\nThe transcript of the July 25 call does not explicitly mention anything about freezing aid until Ukraine investigates the Bidens.\n\n\u201cNo mention of security assistance was made in the readouts either, and I said so in my press remarks on July 27, 2019, in Kyiv,\u201d Volker added in his opening remarks.\n\nU.S. aid to Ukraine was ultimately released on September 11, although the Eastern European country had not launched an investigation into the Bidens.", "description": "NYT confirmed that there could be no quid pro quo because Ukraine did not know the United States had delayed the release of aid.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1171050907-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
