It's been engineered to penetrate the waves in a way that traditional cruise ships currently do not.\n\nThe design of the bow means the ship slices through the water instead of slamming through the waves.\n\nAs a result, fewer vibrations are sent back through the body of the ship, giving passengers a smoother, sleeker ride.\n\nAurora Expeditions has not claimed outright that the 100-passenger Greg Mortimer stops seasickness, but the company does say: 'The main advantage of the X-Bow is that it can pierce waves with more stability than a traditional ship bow.\n\n'Instead of simply rising on the waves and then dropping with tremendous force, the X-Bow is able to absorb the force more consistently across its surface \u2013 enabling the ship to remain more stable during poor weather conditions, increasing comfort for passengers and crew alike.'\n\nAurora Expeditions has not claimed outright that the Greg Mortimer, pictured, stops sea sickness, but the company does say: 'The main advantage of the X-Bow is that it can pierce waves with more stability than a traditional ship bow'\n\nAlthough the Greg Mortimer is the first expedition ship to boast an X-Bow, the bow has been used effectively on tug and shipping vessels in the past.\n\nFeedback from the crews of these ships has confirmed the benefits of the bow.\n\nIt's made by Norway-based Ulstein, and a steward on the Bourbon Orca - the first vessel built with the X-Bow - is quoted on the company's website as saying: 'I don\u2019t have to ask the captain to reduce speed while I\u2019m preparing dinner. The casseroles stay put.'\n\nAccording to the NHS, seasickness is caused by 'repeated movements when travelling, like going over bumps in a car or moving up and down in a boat'.\n\nIt continues: 'The inner ear sends different signals to your brain from those your eyes are seeing. These confusing messages cause you to feel unwell.'\n\nAfter the Greg Mortimer is christened in Ushuaia, Argentina, on October 31, it will make its maiden voyage into Antarctica.\n\nAntarctica is known for having some of the roughest sea conditions in the world, so a smoother journey will no doubt be appreciated by all who sail on her, as well as those who suffer nausea on the high seas.", "description": "The 100-passenger Greg Mortimer will be christened in Ushuaia, Argentina, on October 31, and make its maiden voyage into Antarctica.", "authors": ["Sarah Holt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/17/20091590-0-image-a-4_1571846507059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
