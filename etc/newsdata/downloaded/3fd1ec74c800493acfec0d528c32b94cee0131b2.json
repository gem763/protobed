(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nIn a coastal town in Washington, climate change has a high school junior worried about the floods that keep deluging his school. A 17-year-old from Texas says global warming scares him so much he can\u2019t even think about it.\n\nBut across the country, teens are channeling their anxieties into activism. \u201cFear,\u201d says Maryland 16-year-old Madeline Graham, an organizer of a student protest planned for this week, \u201cis a commodity we don\u2019t have time for if we\u2019re going to win the fight.\u201d\n\nA solid majority of American teenagers are convinced that humans are changing the Earth\u2019s climate and believe that it will cause harm to them personally and to other members of their generation, according to a new Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Roughly 1 in 4 have participated in a walkout, attended a rally or written to a public official to express their views on global warming \u2014 remarkable levels of activism for a group that has not yet reached voting age.\n\nThe poll by The Post and Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) is the first major survey of teenagers\u2019 views since the explosion of the youth climate movement last year. Inspired by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, whose year-long \u201cstrike\u201d in front of the Swedish Parliament and carbon-neutral sailboat voyage across the Atlantic have made her an activist icon, growing numbers of teens have been skipping school on Fridays to protest on behalf of something they say is more important.\n\n[Extreme climate change has arrived in America]\n\nThis week, in the run-up to a major United Nations summit, hundreds of thousands of school kids plan to abandon their classrooms to demand more aggressive measures to protect the planet.\n\n\n\nGreta Thunberg, 16-year-old Swedish climate change activist who has inspired mass youth protests, joins other young climate activists for a climate strike demonstration outside the White House. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cPeople feel very guilty when a child says, \u2018You are stealing my future.\u2019 That has impact,\u201d Thunberg told The Post. \u201cWe have definitely made people open their eyes.\u201d\n\nMore than 7 in 10 teenagers and young adults say climate change will cause a moderate or great deal of harm to people in their generation, a slightly higher percentage than among those 30 and older. By the time today\u2019s high schoolers turn 30, scientists say the world must achieve a \u201crapid and far-reaching\u201d transformation of society to avoid warming\u2019s most dire consequences.\n\nSeveral teenagers told The Post they are already feeling its effects.\n\nGabe Lopez, 16, of Everett, Wash., said warming waters have taken a financial toll on relatives who fish in the Pacific. Graham, who lives in Silver Spring, was inspired to take action after seeing hurricanes bombard Puerto Rico, North Carolina and the Bahamas \u2014 and watching floods repeatedly deluge her grandmother\u2019s home in Ellicott City, Md.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a dystopian novel,\u201d she said. \u201cTo grow up seeing the world fall apart around you and knowing it\u2019s going to be the fight of your lives to make people stop it.\u201d\n\nBoth Lopez and Graham said thinking about climate change makes them afraid, an emotion they share with 57 percent of teens nationwide. Fewer than a third of teens say they are optimistic.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is connected to being a kid,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe can\u2019t vote. We don\u2019t have anyone to represent us.\u201d\n\nAdults, he said, don\u2019t seem to take the issue as seriously, or as personally, as people his age. Lopez recalled getting into an argument with his driving instructor after the older man was dismissive of students\u2019 anxieties about climate change.\n\nAdults \u201cthink: \u2018Oh you\u2019re so young, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know the facts, and I know what the most drastic consequences will be. I know that people aren\u2019t doing what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nTeens are slightly more likely than adults to accept the scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming, 86 percent versus 79 percent. But in other ways, kids are much like the rest of America when it comes to climate change.\n\nRoughly a third of both teenagers and adults say the issue is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them personally. Just under half believe the United States must drastically reduce its fossil fuel use in the next few years to avoid the worst effects of climate change. And roughly 4 in 10 say mitigating the effects of warming will require major sacrifices from ordinary Americans.\n\nTeenagers also share adults\u2019 questions and misconceptions about the ways the world is warming. In both age groups, no more than 2 in 10 say they know \u201ca lot\u201d about the causes of climate change and ways to reduce it. Sizable minorities of teens incorrectly believe that phenomena like volcanic eruptions and the sun getting hotter are major contributors.\n\nDespite many teens\u2019 strong feelings about the issue, fewer than half say they\u2019ve taken action to reduce their own carbon footprints. Their most common approaches are recycling, limiting time in cars and reducing plastic use. And most say they rarely or never discuss the issue with family and friends.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of teenagers who say they\u2019re being taught in school how to mitigate climate change appears to be on the decline. Fourteen percent say they have learned \u201ca lot\u201d about the subject, down from 25 percent in 2010, when the Yale Project on Climate Change asked a similar question.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d said Sam Riley, 17, of Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly ever brought up at my school.\u201d\n\nThe high school junior said he learned nearly everything he knows about climate change from reading the news and searching the Internet. What he found scares and angers him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re killing the thing we live on,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time that I\u2019m old, I know I will see more impacts starting to happen.\u201d\n\nRiley, who is black, believes that minorities and people in low income communities will be most severely impacted by warming, because they are more likely to live in vulnerable areas and less likely to be able to insulate themselves.\n\n\u201cThe wealthier you are, the more protection you have,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Post-KFF poll finds black and Hispanic teens express a greater sense of urgency around climate change; 37 percent and 41 percent, respectively, say people need to act in the next year or two, compared with 24 percent of white teens.\n\nTeens who do not think that human activities are affecting the planet are in the minority. Jane Palmer, 13, of Chubbuck, Idaho, said she doesn\u2019t see how people can influence the climate when Earth has been changing for millions of years. When her eighth-grade science teacher told her class that fossil fuel use is warming the globe, her mother dismissed those lessons as \u201cfearmongering.\u201d\n\nStill, Palmer has noticed that summers in Idaho are getting hotter. She worries that many people \u201cdon\u2019t really care about the Earth,\u201d and says she is still thinking the issue through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of in-between,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a problem, but it\u2019s also not that big a deal. Teachers should talk about it and let us know what\u2019s happening in the world, but they shouldn\u2019t . . . make it seem like the world is going to end.\u201d\n\n\n\nYoung climate activists participate in a climate strike demonstration outside the White House. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nMany of her peers disagree: About 4 in 10 of those under 18 call climate change a \u201ccrisis.\u201d But unlike adults, most teenagers say they don\u2019t feel helpless. More than half \u2014 54 percent \u2014 say they feel motivated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest threat to life as we know it and humanity as we know it,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re facing something like that, and you\u2019re 16 years old, and your mom\u2019s yelling at you, and you have classes, and, on top of that, everybody\u2019s gonna die . . . it\u2019s easy to let fear overtake you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cthis generation \u2014 we\u2019re fighters. And we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nThe Post-KFF survey was conducted online and by telephone from July 9 to Aug. 5, among a national sample of 2,293 adults and 629 teenagers through Amerispeak, a survey panel recruited through random selection of U.S. households by NORC at the University of Chicago. Adult results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points and teen results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.\n\nScott Clement contributed to this report\n\nRead more:\n\nDangerous new hot zones are spreading across the globe\n\nAmericans increasingly see climate change as a crisis, poll shows\n\nHow should we talk about what\u2019s happening to our planet?", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s like a dystopian novel: To grow up seeing the world fall apart around you, and knowing it\u2019s going to be the fight of your lives to make people stop it.\u201d", "authors": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Reporter For Speaking Of Science", "Emily Guskin", "Polling Analyst At The Washington Post Specializing In Public Opinion About Politics", "Elections", "Public Policy.", "September At Am", "Sarah Kaplan Is A Science Reporter Covering News Around The Nation", "Across The Universe.
