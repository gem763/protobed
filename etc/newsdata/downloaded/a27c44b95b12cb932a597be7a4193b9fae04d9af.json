Add Interest\n\nA jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia-Zarate, 46, in 2017 of first degree murder, second degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, and assault with a semiautomatic firearm for his role in the death of Kate Steinle.\n\nGarcia-Zarate was convicted, however, on the charge of felon in possession of a firearm.\n\nDuring jury deliberations, jury members asked the court for the definition of possession and if there was a time requirement for possession. The defense argued during the appeal that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it could acquit Garcia-Zarate because he only possessed the gun for a moment.\n\nOn Friday, the First Appellate Court of Appeals in California, in a 3-0 decision, agreed with that defense.\n\nPaul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle/AP\n\n\u201cViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defense, as we must, we conclude the trial court erred in failing to give the momentary possession instruction. Because the error was prejudicial, we are compelled as a matter of law to reverse,\u201d the court\u2019s opinion says.\n\n\"These questions go to the heart of the momentary possession defense,\" Justice Sandra Margulies wrote. \"The fact the jury asked whether there was a time requirement for possession suggests jurors were wrestling with how long defendant had the gun.\"\n\nSteinle was walking with her family on Pier 14 on July 1, 2015, when she was hit by a bullet that had ricocheted off a concrete wall, hitting her in the back. Police said Garcia-Zarate knowingly fired the gun, then threw it in the water.\n\nThe defense successfully argued during his trail that the gun was wrapped in rags, which he picked up when it fired accidentally. He then, the defense said, threw it in the water so it would stop firing, according to court documents.\n\nMichael macor/San Francisco Chronicle/AP\n\nThe gun Garcia-Zarate shot belonged to a U.S. Bureau of Land Management ranger who reported that the gun was stolen from his car in San Francisco.\n\nDespite the overturned conviction, Garcia-Zarate will remain in jail on related federal charges.\n\n\"We pray that the U.S. Attorney's Office is successful in prosecuting Garcia-Zarate and that this menace will no longer be able to terrorize our streets,\u201d the police association said.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Officers Association blasted the court's decision, saying this is \u201canother episode\" of San Francisco judges caring more about criminals than victims.\n\nRidiculous. Where's the accountability? When will our criminal justice system start considering the interests of crime victims and public safety?https://t.co/I8Fhm5GDlx pic.twitter.com/unfjdHto0L \u2014 San Francisco POA (@SanFranciscoPOA) August 31, 2019\n\n\"This is yet another disgusting injustice perpetrated by a broken criminal justice system that is more intent on re-harming the victims of crime and their families than holding violent offenders accountable,\u201d a statement from the police association read.\n\nThe San Francisco district attorney's office is weighing its next steps, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Steinle family did not immediately respond when asked for comment by ABC News.", "description": "A California appeals overturned the lone conviction of Jose Ines Garcia-Zarate in the 2015 shooting death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/sf-pier-shooting-ap-hb-171130_16x9_992.jpg"}
