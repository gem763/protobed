We had a real struggle last year and I was probably not on the front foot a lot of the time at club level. I had to learn how to play and keep the team in it a little bit more so it probably stood me in good stead.\n\n'I like to get the ball and get to the line and play an attacking game and with this England pack you are going to get chances to do that. I feel in a good place myself but the pack is incredible when they play like that.'\n\nFord has spoken of the creative licence he is allowed when he plays for the national team\n\nEngland play France in their final group match next Saturday in Yokohama, with a last-eight spot secure but the top spot in Pool C likely to be on the line.\n\nFord, an avid rugby watcher, will have an eye on France's game against Tonga on Sunday.\n\nHe added: 'They have some great athletes and we are going to have to be at our best next week.'", "description": "ADAM HATHAWAY IN TOKYO:  The fly-half was on form again on Saturday in England's 39-10 win over Argentina, playing behind a pack that gave him plenty of ball.", "authors": ["Adam Hathaway For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/21/19342450-0-image-a-6_1570307936167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
