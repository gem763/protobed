It was a great test for us, especially with some of the situations we will face on tour,\u201d Pienaar said.\n\n\u201cIt is about building a winning culture and it will be a massive challenge and we know that. This team has learnt a lot and as players we have been put in difficult situations and it is about kicking on and we are embracing the challenge.\u201d\n\nPienaar said it was about embracing the challenge as they now have a week off, before heading to Europe for three games under Hawies Fourie as coach. Fourie replaces Franco Smith \u2013 a change that should have happened at the beginning of the season had Fourie not had to undergo a medical procedure that delayed his arrival in Bloemfontein.\n\n\u201cCoach Franco said this week the four lines stay the same. We have a game plan in place and the structures are in place and we believe in that. I\u2019m not sure how that will change in the next two weeks but we have learned a lot.\n\n\u201cNow it is about embracing that challenge and getting some consistency in our performances away from home.\u201d\n\nPienaar praised the forward for creating the platform that allowed the backs to explode in the second half and take the game away from Munster.\n\n\u201cThe way we play is really a team effort. Our forwards work hard and the structures are in place and gives the guys the confidence to play. It is an exciting brand to play. We have players with good feet and pace but we play a 15-man brand and everyone needs to do their job for the others to shine,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe back each other and we all work hard for each other. For us it is a team effort. It is a squad effort and there are a lot of guys who have trained but haven\u2019t played a minute. The culture that has been created is great, and it is good for the guys to come in every day, you want to come in and that shows on the field.\u201d\n\nIn Port Elizabeth Southern Kings\u2019 coach Robbie Kempson lamented his side\u2019s poor start as they conceded five first half tries to slump to a 42-17 loss to Ulster, their third loss of the season.\n\nWhile the young side battled back in the second half, playing catch-up was too difficult even though they had more than their fair share of chances in the second stanza.\n\n\u201cThat first half they totally outplayed us. They played exactly the game we wanted to play in having a fast start. They capitalised on three or four errors and there were three or four tries. Defensively we had individual errors from players that didn\u2019t help us. That is why we made the changes at half time to shore up that defensive effort,\u201d Kempson said on the defensive effort.\n\nKempson did praise the substitutes that took the field after half time and their performance in the second half.\n\n\u201cThe substitutions made a difference and from halftime on we were basically an under-23 side that was on the field and it went better. There was a lot more energy and a lot more effort and I have to give it to the side which played in the second half. We showed what we can do if we are given the opportunity and the players go out there and produce the goods.\n\n\u201cCertainly there were no harsh words at half time. You have to keep the players as calm as possible especially when you are on the back foot as we were at the end of the first half.\u201d\n\nBoth sides now have a week off before they head to Europe for a batch of three away games.\n\nSCORES:\n\nCHEETAHS 40 MUNSTER 16\n\nScorers\n\nFree State Cheetahs \u2013 tries: Ox Nche, Junior Pokomela, William Small-Smith, Joseph Dweba, Jasper Wiese, Rhyno Smith.
