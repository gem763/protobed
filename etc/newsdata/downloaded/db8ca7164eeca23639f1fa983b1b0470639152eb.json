The story added that Hill, who served as senior director for European and Russian affairs at the National Security Council, stopped short of suggesting that Sondland \u201cmaliciously or intentionally\u201d put the U.S. at risk.\n\nSondland, a Trump inauguration donor and hotel owner, had no foreign policy experience before being installed in his current role. His involvement in a scheme to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating President Donald Trump\u2019s political enemies is at the heart of the congressional impeachment inquiry.\n\nAccording to the Times report, Hill told investigators that malicious actors might take advantage of Sondland\u2019s habits of using his personal cellphone for official diplomatic business, circumventing protocol to personally invite foreign dignitaries to the White House, and sharing U.S. officials\u2019 phone numbers with foreigners.\n\nIn a Sept. 9 text message exchange with Sondland, William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, expressed dismay over the idea that Trump was involving the State Department in an effort to leverage military aid to force Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s political opponents.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote.\n\nSondland waited five hours to reply to Taylor\u2019s text, according to records released by the House chairmen leading the impeachment investigation. In that time, Sondland spoke with Trump on the phone, according to reporting by NBC News and The New York Times.\n\nThe E.U. ambassador then dismissed Taylor\u2019s concerns. \u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d he wrote to his colleague.\n\nSondland has been subpoenaed to testify in the impeachment investigation on Thursday, and his lawyers say the ambassador intends to honor the subpoena despite White House instructions not to.", "description": "Fiona Hill told impeachment investigators of fears raised by Gordon Sondland\u2019s naive actions, The New York Times wrote.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da771ce2100004c0fad2fff.jpeg?cache=r1hdxb1smx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
