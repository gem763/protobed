Oops. Turns out the OBR is sufficiently fed up of government prevaricating that it\u2019s going to divulge the information outside of the normal cycle.\n\nWhile we await them, the Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank, has put forward some estimates of its own. It thinks the Treasury is on target to overshoot its deficit target by \u00a316bn this year. That\u2019s a huge miss. It\u2019s like Sergio Aguero stepping up to take a penalty for Manchester City and hitting the corner flag.\n\nThe reasons for this are various. A deteriorating economy (hello there, Brexit) including a slump in manufacturing and construction has led to disappointing tax receipts. There\u2019s been a change to the accounting treatment of student loans. Then there\u2019s the addition of \u00a313bn to departmental spending plans for 2020-2021. In other words, a pre-election bribe. All have played a part.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe net result, however, is that the \u00a327bn Brexit cushion set aside by Philip Hammond, the last real chancellor to occupy 11 Downing Street, has vanished and more besides.\n\nThat would be a problem if the government was still trying to obey its fiscal rules, which call for a balanced budget by 2025-26 and returning the cyclically adjusted public sector net borrowing to less than 2 per cent of GDP by 2020-21, among other things.\n\nBut with an election looming, they\u2019ve been chucked out of the window. Is that necessarily a bad thing? After a decade of the Tory austerity, Britain\u2019s public services and its infrastructure are sorely in need of investment.\n\nRock-bottom interest rates make it cheap to borrow for the purposes of doing that, and the economy could certainly use the help right now.\n\nBut is the government\u2019s largesse going to be felt in the right places? Boris Johnson has, for example, proposed tax cuts for the rich, based on the now debunked idea that they\u2019ll help the economy and result in wealth trickling down the ladder.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this report comes just ahead of the first report of the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, which helped to focus attention on the plight of the poor and the state of the places they have to live in. Jeremy Corbyn caused quite the row when he sought to draw a link between it and Tory spending cuts in the disaster\u2019s aftermath. Theresa May insisted that the problems with tower-block cladding went back decades, and sought to pin part of the blame on the Blair administration.\n\nBut what can\u2019t be denied, or blamed on previous administrations, is that the poor have suffered the most under austerity. The controversial benefits freeze, for example, remains.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look as if they can expect much help from the government turning the taps on, because they don\u2019t tend to vote Tory.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Both parties seem intent on competing with each other in promising a new nirvana with scant regard to any economic or fiscal realities. Meanwhile, Brexit continues to suck money from the public purse, money that could actually be used to address some of the deep-seated economic and social problems Britain faces. The official figures will indeed make for interesting reading.", "description": "Dominic Cummings must have thought he had good reason for telling the Treasury\u2019s chief PR man Sajid Javid to delay\u00a0his first budget: in theory there\u2019d be no official forecasts for how much he\u2019s planning to borrow on our behalf courtesy of the Office for Budgetary Responsibility.
