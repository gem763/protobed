Trump didn\u2019t stop at asking Zelensky for a favor \u2014 helping smear Biden in exchange for releasing the $250 million in aid to Ukraine that had already been mandated by Congress. Trump also revealed his ignorance of Ukraine with his comments about a dismissed prosecutor and his persistent delusions about shifting blame away from Russia for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server in 2016. He even made a cryptic threat against the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. All this in five pages of a call summary that Trump and his team thought would exonerate him!\n\nThis follows another familiar autocratic pattern: When you can no longer credibly deny the facts, deflect to details, push alternative theories and slander the witnesses and accusers. For the full neo-Soviet disinformation campaign, toss in some whataboutism and flood the state news channels \u2014 aka Fox News \u2014 with your surrogates and sycophants. The goal is to get you to forget the facts, and that what Trump and Rudy Giuliani have already openly admitted to doing is enough to warrant impeachment\u2026\n\nWatergate was a petty crime that led to graver abuses by the Nixon White House trying to cover it up. It was a small, domestic affair compared to the global Mafia syndicate we\u2019re seeing in action today. Trump\u2019s crime is not small at all and the cover-up is indicative of how bad things would continue to get if he\u2019s left unchecked by legal action.", "description": "", "authors": ["Garry Kasparov", "Nydailynews.Com Opinion"], "top_image": ""}
