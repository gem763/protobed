(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nNorth Korea and the United States will resume negotiations Saturday, marking the first official talks between the two sides since President Trump met Kim Jong in June, the North Korean government announced Tuesday.\n\nNorth Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said the two countries \u201cagreed to hold a working-level discussion on October 5th, following a preliminary contact on the 4th,\u201d according to a statement carried by North Korea\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency.\n\n\u201cI expect the working-level talks to accelerate positive developments in DPRK-U.S. relations,\u201d Choe said, using the initials of her country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \u201cOur representatives are ready to attend the working-level talks with the United States.\u201d\n\nChoe\u2019s statement did not say where the talks would take place.\n\nNegotiations between the two countries\u2019 diplomats have been frozen since the breakdown of a summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. Another meeting between the two leaders at the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas in June was supposed to lead to a resumption of negotiations, but the stalemate persisted until now.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea has conducted a series of short-range ballistic missile tests, while complaining bitterly about joint military exercises carried out by the United States and South Korea.\n\nOn Monday, North Korea blamed the stalling of the dialogue on Washington and Seoul, accusing them of failing to keep their promises.\n\nNorth Korean Ambassador Kim Song told the U.N. General Assembly that it was up to the United States whether negotiations \u201cwill become a window of opportunity or an occasion that will hasten the crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation on the Korean Peninsula has not come out of the vicious cycle of increased tension, which is entirely attributable to the political and military provocations perpetrated by the U.S.,\u201d the ambassador said.\n\nNorth Korea has also insisted that talks will succeed only if the United States takes a different approach from the one it took in Hanoi, but it has been careful not to criticize Trump directly.\n\nIndeed, the North Korean Foreign Ministry also said last week that Trump is \u201cdifferent from his predecessors in political sense and decision,\u201d and said it hoped he would make a wise and bold decision.\n\nExperts said Pyongyang saw a potential window of opportunity for progress under Trump.\n\n\u201cAs this year draws to an end, Kim Jong Un is trying to speed up the nuclear talks,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.\n\n\u201cNext year, the United States will have its presidential election, and South Korea will have a legislative election. Kim\u2019s strategy could be to have his third meeting with President Trump before next year to get the best result ahead of the elections race.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Talks between the two nations have been frozen since a failed February summit in Hanoi.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea.", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ph-terfzRx4qMiKoVEQrNBQVPXo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MRLXGAXEGEI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
