note sent to Ms Wollaston, the prime minister wrote: \"Dear Sarah, I promised that I will come to the liaison committee and I will keep that promise but I am afraid I must now focus on delivering Brexit in the difficult circumstances in which we now find ourselves, and I believe I would be of greater value if I could postpone to a fixed date nearer 5 or 6 months after I became PM, so that my appearance took place after roughly the same period in office as Gordon Brown, David Cameron & Theresa May.\"\n\n\"I do hope you will understand.\"\n\nBut Ms Wollaston, a former Tory who joined the Liberal Democrats earlier this year, replied: \"Frankly, I am astonished that, at such short notice, you are refusing to face detailed scrutiny from select committee chairs tomorrow morning. This is the third time that you have postponed or cancelled.\n\n\"I have already conveyed the committee's deep disappointment that you did not appear on Wednesday 11th September, despite your suggestion of that date and your later reassurance that you would keep that commitment.\n\nShe added: \"Our role as select committee chairs is to ask you detailed questions on behalf of the public and we planned to do so on Brexit, climate change, health and social care. It is unacceptable that you are refusing to be held to account.\n\nIan Lavery MP, chair of the Labour Party, said: \u201cBoris Johnson is a coward.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s running scared because he doesn\u2019t want his failure to deliver and his false promises on Brexit, the climate crisis and our public services, exposed.\n\n\u201cWhen will the prime minister accept that it's not one rule for him and one for everyone else?\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson has prompted accusations that he is \"refusing to be held to account\" after again pulling out of an appearance\u00a0before\u00a0senior MPs.
