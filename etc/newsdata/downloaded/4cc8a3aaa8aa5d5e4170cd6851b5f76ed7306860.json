Not at all. That\u2019s because after Nadal grabbed the opening two sets and went up a break in third, Medvedev mounted a charge, shifting styles and rattling Nadal.\n\nWHAT. A. MATCH.\n\n\n\nAfter a five-set battle, Nadal wins his 19th Grand Slam title \ud83d\udc4f #USOpen \ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/cKpt2XKge4 \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 9, 2019\n\nMedvedev broke in the last game of each of the next two sets to force a fifth. But his attempt to become the first man since 1949 to win a U.S. Open final after trailing by two sets to none came up just short.\n\nNadal broke to lead 3-2 in the fifth and again for 5-2. But he failed to serve out the victory there, double-faulting on break point, then couldn\u2019t convert two match points at 5-3.\n\nAt 5-4, Nadal saved a break point, and finally converted his third championship point to earn his fourth trophy at Flushing Meadows.\n\nAdd that to 12 at the French Open, two at Wimbledon and one at the Australian Open, and Nadal is now only one major trophy behind Roger Federer for the most by a man in tennis history.", "description": "Rafael Nadal edged Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 to win his fourth U.S. Open title and 19th Grand Slam trophy overall on Sunday night.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ891_nadal0_ZG_20190908211531.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
