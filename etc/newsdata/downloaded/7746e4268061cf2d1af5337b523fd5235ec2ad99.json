But he warned that school administrators needed to have \u201cglobal competency\u201d or risk the kind of firestorm that enveloped the National Basketball Association this month over a pro-Hong Kong tweet from an executive.\n\nStudents from Hong Kong say the values of the movement seem straightforward and ripe for campus support in the United States: democracy, freedom of expression, the right to protest. But given the sizable mainland Chinese populations at American universities \u2014 along with accusations that the protesters have incited violence and lawlessness \u2014 the question of how schools should address the issue has been anything but simple.\n\nOf the 1.1 million international students in the United States, one-third come from China, according to the Institute of International Education. In the 2017-18 school year, over 360,000 were from the mainland and 7,000 from Hong Kong. International students typically pay full tuition, serving as a critical source of funds for universities: They contributed more than $30 billion to the American economy in the 2014-15 school year.\n\nJoy Ming King, a senior at Wesleyan University, spoke last month as part of a panel on the protests, sharing his experience marching in Hong Kong this summer. More than 100 students packed the room. Days later, he read in Wesleyan\u2019s campus newspaper that the university was exploring the opening of a satellite campus in China, in partnership with a Chinese corporation and a theater academy. The leader of the venture would be a Chinese Communist Party secretary.\n\n\u201cI came back to campus and found out my university\u2019s administration is proposing to partner with the regime that my friends and family are being terrorized by,\u201d said Mr. King, who later organized a rally opposing the project.\n\nMichael Roth, president of Wesleyan and author of \u201c Safe Enough Spaces ,\u201d said that \u201cthere isn\u2019t just one student view about events in Hong Kong\u201d and that he had met with students in recent weeks to discuss the protests and proposed campus.", "description": "Officials face the challenging task of supporting free expression without alienating the largest demographic of international students on American campuses.", "authors": ["Emma Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/multimedia/26hkcolleges/00hkcolleges-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
