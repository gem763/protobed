Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSecond intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report Trump mocks Schiff with Pinocchio-themed video Democrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony MORE (D-Calif.) by posting a video using clips from the Disney movie \"Pinocchio\" to imply that the House Intelligence chairman had been lying about a whistleblower who filed a complaint relating to Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nThe clip uses footage of statements Schiff has made about the whistleblower interspersed with footage of Pinocchio's nose growing. It ends with the Blue Fairy, a character in the film, saying to Pinocchio \"perhaps you haven't been telling the truth.\"\n\n\"But I have, every single word,\" replied the puppet, whose nose had grown significantly.\n\n\"LYIN\u2019 SHIFTY SCHIFF!\" Trump tweeted with the video clip, using a name for the Democratic congressman who is helping lead House Democrats' impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nEarlier Friday, the The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" column gave Schiff four Pinocchios for saying that his committee had \"not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump allies have hammered Schiff over the remark, which he made in an MSNBC interview last month, after The New York Times reported this week that the whistleblower had talked with staff for Schiff's committee before filing the complaint.\n\n\u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to,\" Schiff said on Sept. 17. \"But I am sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just how he is supposed to communicate with Congress, and so the risk to the whistleblower is retaliation.\u201d\n\nThe Post said Schiff's comment was \"flat-out false,\" and gave him four Pinocchios, a ranking given to statements that the column considers most egregious.\n\nA spokesperson for the House Intelligence Committee told the Post that Schiff's answer in the MSNBC interview \"should have been more carefully phrased.\"\n\n\u201cRegarding Chairman Schiff\u2019s comments on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 in the context, he intended to answer the question of whether the Committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not,\u201d the spokesperson told the newspaper.\n\n\u201cAs he said in his answer, the whistleblower was then awaiting instructions from the Acting [Director of National Intelligence] as to how the whistleblower could contact the Committee. Nonetheless he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower complaint said that Trump \"sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader,\" Volodymyr Zelensky, into probing former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nTrump requested the investigation during a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian leader that came while Trump was withholding military assistance for the country that had been approved by Congress.\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint is now at the center of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump.", "description": "President Trump on Friday mocked Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/schiffadam_trumpdonald_100219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
