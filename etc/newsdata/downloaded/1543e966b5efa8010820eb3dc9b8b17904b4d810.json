(Amanda Pfeffer/CBC)\n\nVolunteers from a number of groups participated Saturday, including the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, the Canadian Red Cross, Civil Air Search and Rescue, Ontario Search and Rescue and the Salvation Army.\n\nAndrew Stanzel, an intensive care unit nurse in Ottawa, said many residents may not be aware of the potential danger.\n\n\"It was surprising for me when I found out about [the risk],\" said Stanzel, who helped organize exercises involving St. John Ambulance volunteers retrieving people in medical distress from difficult-to-reach locations.\n\nA search-and-rescue boat combs the Ottawa River shoreline for wounded during a simulated earthquake exercise on Oct. 5, 2019.
