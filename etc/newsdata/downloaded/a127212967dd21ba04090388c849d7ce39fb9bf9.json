Guyana and Cyprus nab the other places on the podium.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nThe so-called resource replacement ratio for conventional resources now stands around 16%, which is the lowest seen in recent history.\n\n\u201cThis means that only one barrel out of every six consumed is being replaced by new sources. This is the lowest replacement ratio we have witnessed in the last two decades,\u201d Shenga added.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nHowever, the industry has high hopes after the prolific success of ExxonMobil\u2019s Stabroek block off the coast of Guyana and more recent discoveries by other operators in the region, which have led to a surge in offshore exploration in the Caribbean. More acreage is being made available for bidding, with some countries conducting their first-ever licensing rounds in 2019 and 2020.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Oil and gas companies have discovered 7.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) year-to-date, resulting in a replacement rate of a meagre 16%", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gRVk2qcujIz6t0gAMMvQdA--~B/aD0zMTA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/6afc36df5ec483609b01baf1d4dc35fd", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
