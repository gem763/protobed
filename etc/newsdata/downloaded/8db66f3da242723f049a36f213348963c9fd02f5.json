The abrupt pause had fuelled concerns among election monitors and foreign governments over potential vote tampering.\n\nAfter the 24-hour gap, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) updated its count to show Morales with a wider lead of 46.85 per cent of votes to rival Carlos Mesa's 36.73 per cent, just enough to give him the 10-point lead needed to win in the first round.\n\nAs protesters scuffled with police in the streets of the capital, La Paz, outside the counting venue, runnerup Mesa slammed the results as \"shameful\" and said he would not recognize them.\n\n\"We trust citizens won't accept this,\" Mesa told journalists in the lowland city of Santa Cruz. \"This government has created an impossible situation. It's mocking the popular vote.\"\n\nJust a day earlier, Mesa had celebrated making it to a second round after an official count of nearly 84 per cent of ballots showed Morales short of the votes needed to avoid a run-off. Other polls also showed a tight race leading to a second round.\n\nA protester waves the Bolivian flag as MAS and opposition supporters gather in front of the official electoral computing centre in La Paz on Monday. (Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters)\n\nMorales, however, who has won his previous three terms with solid majorities, insisted late on Sunday that he would get enough votes from rural areas for an outright win.\n\nThe uncertainty sparked protests in the landlocked South American country and fears among international election observers and diplomats about potential manipulation of the vote, with some worried it could trigger the kind of violent unrest that has recently roiled Chile and Ecuador.\n\n\"The result is in question and we're seeing the start of a conflict, a climate could be unleashed that moves this from tension to convulsion,\" said Bolivian political analyst Franklin Pareja.\n\nBefore the electoral court resumed updating of preliminary results on Monday, thousands of Bolivians protested outside a hotel in La Paz where the TSE had gathered to process votes. Police fired tear gas at crowds, amid reports of clashes in protests elsewhere.\n\nThe TSE's earlier decision to halt the provisionary count with just 83.76 per cent of the ballot completed had prompted the official monitor, the Organization of American States (OAS), to demand to know why.\n\nA riot police officer fires pepper spray at Mesa supporters during a struggle on Monday outside the hotel in La Paz where the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has its headquarters to count the election votes.

(Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters)\n\nIf Morales wins, Latin America's longest continuous-serving standing leader would extend his rule to 19 years.\n\nAntonio Costas, one of the six-member TSE team coordinating the count, told Reuters on Monday that the decision had been made to suspend the preliminary count to focus on the slower official calculation.\n\nThat count, still underway, with about 60 per cent of ballots processed, has Mesa and Morales closely tied with a little over 42 per cent of votes each.\n\nCostas added that he had not come under any political pressure to halt the preliminary count, which had been meant as a tool to help ensure greater transparency of the vote.\n\nMorales, a former union leader of coca growers, has overseen a long stretch of political and economic stability for Bolivia, the continent's poorest country. His support has slipped amid slowing economic growth and concern about government corruption and anti-democratic practices.", "description": "Bolivia's electoral board released new data late on Monday that showed President Evo Morales had enough votes to win the hotly contested election, sparking allegations of fraud from the opposition and angry clashes in the streets.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5329793.1571711179!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bolivia-election-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
