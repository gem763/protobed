In that hearing, he pretended to read from a transcript of a telephone conversation between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Trump. In his rendition, he made totally false claims.\n\nSchiff later defended his slander by asserting that he was engaged in parody. His lame attempt at comedy was the final piece of evidence proving his unworthiness to preside over the informal and unauthorized impeachment hearings being foisted upon the country by House Democrats.\n\nAs my resolution of censure against Schiff states, his phony version of the Trump-Zelensky phone call was \u201can egregiously false and fabricated retelling\u201d that \u201chad no relationship to the call itself.\u201d\n\nMy resolution goes on to state that \u201cthese actions of Chairman Schiff misled the American people, bring disrepute upon the House of Representatives, and make a mockery of the impeachment process, one of this chamber\u2019s most solemn constitutional duties.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Andy Biggs", "Foxnews.Com Opinion Rep-Andy-Biggs-Impeachment-Drive-Is-Based-On-Trump-Derangement-Syndrome-Not-Facts-Schiff-Unfit-To-Lead-It"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
