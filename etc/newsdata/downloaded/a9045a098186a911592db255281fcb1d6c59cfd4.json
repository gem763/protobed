But something as basic as securing the country\u2019s democratic system has become a political wedge for national politicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty frustrating,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a pretty obvious need for more investment. I think what\u2019s really unfortunate about this issue is it has gotten pretty intensely wrapped up in ideological conflict within the two parties.\u201d\n\nThe funding measure agreed to this month brings the total amount of election security funding to just over $600m since fiscal year 2018, and empowers the Trump administration to dole out funding to help states with their systems, which are decentralised and can vary from state to state and, in some cases, from county to county across the US.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

An election system used in the 2018 election in Williamsburg, Virginia, for instance, ran on a 15-year-old operating system with known vulnerabilities, for instance.\n\nAnd in 14 states, some voters show up to the polls that do not create a paper ballot after they vote, leaving those polling machines open to digital manipulation without a clear way to recount that would be available with paper ballots.\n\nAll of those concerns \u2013 in addition to other concerns like general disinformation campaigns by foreign or domestic parties \u2013 have created a situation in which the 2020 elections remain vulnerable to the same kinds of attacks seen in 2016, experts say.\n\nKaren Hobert Flynn, the president of the activist group Common Cause, says McConnell\u2019s decision to support funding is a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d, but that the funding \u201cstill falls far short\u201d of what is needed to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cElection systems across the country have been breached by Russian intelligence assets and those attacks continue to this day,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cThese attacks and those of other hostile foreign powers will continue to ramp up as we approach the 2020 elections, and cash-strapped local elections officials desperately need significant federal assistance. The federal government must step in to provide the resources and the expertise to help states and local governments secure the integrity of their election systems against sophisticated foreign cyber attacks.\u201d\n\nAlthough the election itself is on 3 November 2020, Americans will start voting on 2 February in the Iowa caucuses to choose a Democratic candidate.", "description": "With less than five months until the first votes are officially cast in the run-up to the\u00a02020 election, congress this month\u00a0finally made moves to try and shore up election security after a bitter fight that has played out in the long shadow cast by Russian attacks on the 2016 election \u2013 and, for some election security experts, the effort is quite literally the least that", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/20/gettyimages-1167239994-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
