The world now is a much safer place.\n\nMilitary choppers and even drones provided air cover as US special forces engaged targets on the ground in Idlib province \u2013 the last major terrorist stronghold in the country.\n\nAlso on rt.com Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Here\u2019s what you need to know about the infamous ISIS leader\n\nAl-Baghdadi escaped to a tunnel dug under his hideout and took three of his young children. He was chased by the dogs and when he reached the dead end the terrorist detonated the suicide vest he was wearing.\n\nThe IS leader and his children died on site, Trump confirmed, saying the body of the notorious militant \"was mutilated\", but the tests allowed to identify him.\n\nThe US forces suffered no casualties during the two-hour-long raid, with only a dog, which chased the terrorist into the tunnel, being hurt. Meanwhile, \u201cmany\u201d of al-Baghdadi\u2019s fighters and associates were killed. Washington also obtained \u201chighly sensitive materials,\u201d which will reveal a lot about IS activities and future plans, Trump said.\n\nThe president also praised the \u201cgreat cooperation\u201d with Russia during the op as Moscow opened up the airspace under its control in Syria to American planes when Washington asked for it. The US has been after al-Baghdadi for many years, but was only able to scope out his whereabouts a few weeks ago, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the elimination of the IS leader doesn\u2019t change his plans to withdraw American forces from Syria, Trump noted. However, the US troops who were sent to secure the oil fields in the country\u2019s northeastern province of Deir ez-Zor earlier this week, will remain on site.\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump thanks Russia, Turkey, Syria, Iraq & Kurds for aiding US operation that killed al-Baghdadi\n\nSomewhat raining on Trump\u2019s parade, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said later on Sunday that the death alone cannot eradicate the ideology that inspires Islamic State group. According to his French counterpart, Florence Parly, the American operaion was an \"early retirement for a terrorist, but not for his organisation.\"\n\nThere have been previous reports of al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, but none were confirmed. At the height of its power, al-Baghdadi\u2019s terrorist group controlled vast swathes of Iraq and Syria. The Syrian Army, aided by Iran and Russia, has nearly eradicated the group from its territory.\n\nThe killing of al-Baghdadi could actually have the opposite effect to what Trump was declaring, former Pentagon official Michael Maloof warned in an interview with RT.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll give it [Islamic State] a fresh impetus to continue on,\u201d he pointed out, adding that a lot will depend on how charismatic the group\u2019s new leader will be.\n\nThere are also rumors that al-Baghdadi\u2019s death may pave the way for a reunion between IS and Al-Qaeda, which would be \u201can even more potentially dangerous thing,\u201d Maloof said. The two groups used to be enemies due to al-Baghdadi falling out with Al-Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, but now this obstacle has been removed by the US.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
