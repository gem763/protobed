Now, leading presidential candidates are calling for such a reset. Bernie Sanders has proposed wiping out the country's $1.6 trillion outstanding student loan tab. Essentially, all borrowers would be freed from their debt. \"This is truly a revolutionary proposal,\" Sanders told The Washington Post. Under Elizabeth Warren's plan, borrowers with household incomes of less than $100,000 would get $50,000 of their student debt forgiven. People who earn between $100,000 and $250,000 would be eligible for forgiveness on a sliding scale \u2013 that $50,000 in debt relief drops by $1 for every $3 a person earns over $100,000. And those who earn more than $250,000 would be ineligible for debt forgiveness. At a recent campaign event, Kamala Harris hinted that she'd be rolling out a plan soon to forgive the student loan debt of families who earn less than $100,000 a year.
