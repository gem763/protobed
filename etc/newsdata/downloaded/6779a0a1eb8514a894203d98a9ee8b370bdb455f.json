For your weekend reading, we've started in-case-you-missed-it compilations of some of the week's top USA TODAY Opinion pieces. As always, thanks for reading, and for your feedback.\n\n\u2014 USA TODAY Opinion editors\n\nBy Lauren Leader\n\n\"It has been a big month for Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ... But rising along with Warren is anxiety among corporate leaders, especially the growing number of women working in the corporate sector, who fear her strident anti-corporate rhetoric could actually cost Democrats the presidency if she is the nominee. ... They fear that if offended, big-company employees stay home in 2020, especially women, President Donald Trump could win again.\"\n\nBy The Editorial Board\n\n\"(House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) needs to call for a vote on launching an inquiry \u2014 sooner rather than later. ... Americans should know where their elected representatives stand on launching an inquiry. This isn't an impeachment vote. And it isn't a mystery whether it would pass. ... Moreover, such a vote would give the House impeachment investigation a stronger hand in court for obtaining White House documents and testimony.\"\n\nDiversity is our strength (Photo: Sean Delonas/Easton, Pennsylvania/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Kevin Gover\n\n\"The observance of Columbus Day is the outgrowth of a whitewashed history, perpetuated in public discourse and in our schools, where native and nonnative children, from the earliest age, are taught simplistic, incomplete and inaccurate information about American Indians. ... These narratives, in turn, influence government policies and shape how nonnatives respond to their Native American neighbors.\"\n\nBy Tom Nichols\n\n\"When (Democrats and I) watched CNN's LGBTQ town hall for the Democratic candidates Thursday, we had very different reactions. ... You thought it was great. You saw a ringing defense of LGBTQ rights and a reaffirmation of what Democrats stand for. I saw it and thought: Are these people insane? Are they trying to lose the election?\"\n\nRudy Giuliani (Photo: Adam Zyglis/The Buffalo (New York) News/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Ross K. Baker\n\n\"Presidents have often been nettled by congressional committees but no president has ever successfully challenged the right of committees to take testimony from witnesses thereby obstructing their ability to function as the framers intended. ... This act of subversion by President Donald Trump ... is a frontal attack on a time-honored power of a legislative body handed down to us from centuries of British lawmakers.\"\n\nBy Bandy X. Lee\n\n\"I have been compelled to blow two whistles: first, by publishing a book to alert the public that Donald Trump was more dangerous than perhaps any president in history, for psychological reasons; and second, on the American Psychiatric Association's actions that have effectively silenced those of us trying to fulfill our professional responsibility to society as outlined in its own code of ethics.\"\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
