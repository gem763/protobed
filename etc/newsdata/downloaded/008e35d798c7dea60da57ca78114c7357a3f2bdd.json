John Durham, on the other hand, as a U.S. attorney, can also issue a report just like the IG did, but if he finds criminal wrongdoing, he can impanel a grand jury and criminally prosecute anyone that he believes may have broken the law.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky added, \u201cEveryone should remember it is against the law for the CIA to operate domestically, and if they were engaging in domestic operations to spy on American citizens, including people working inside the Trump campaign, then they did break federal law and they are in a lot of trouble, or they should be in a lot of trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf [the CIA] discovers foreign espionage going on inside the United States, they have to turn that over to the FBI,\u201d continued von Spakosvky. \u201cThe FBI has a huge counterintelligence division whose only job it is to stop foreign espionage going on inside the United States. The CIA cannot do that. Their task is to operate abroad and to gather intelligence for the United States. Counterintelligence [is] the FBI\u2019s responsibility.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky went on, \u201cIf the CIA handed over false information or information they had not checked and verified to the FBI, then the CIA people are potentially in trouble, as would be the FBI if they then did not verify or check the information they were getting from the CIA. We know they didn\u2019t do that when it came to the Steele dossier. The FBI didn\u2019t check any of that information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think \u2026 maybe folks in the intelligence agencies [are] very scared and very worried about the investigation that John Durham is doing, and hoping that this distracts the public and distracts Congress,\u201d estimated von Spakovsky.\n\n\n\nComey has mocked concernsabout the FBI\u2019s surveillance of Trump\u2019s campaign as \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d He also denied that the FBI \u2014 under his directorship \u2014 \u201cspied on the Trump campaign\u201d or engaged in \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "Intelligence agencies may be scared of indictments yielded by U.S. Attorney John Durham's Russiagate investigation, said Hans von Spakovsky.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/Comey-Clapper-Brennan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
