Pavel Golovkin/Pool via REUTERS - RC19A45CE470/File Photo\n\nIn a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan before the operation against U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, Russian leader Vladimir Putin, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, made clear he hoped the incursion would be limited in time and scale, the sources said.\n\n\u201cThe sooner this conflict situation is over, the better for everyone,\u201d said Andrei Klimov, a senior pro-Putin lawmaker in Russia\u2019s Senate.\n\n\u201cI really hope our Turkish partners do everything to avoid even a chance conflict on the ground with Syrian government forces and even more so with Russian soldiers.\u201d\n\nFor Russia, it\u2019s a delicate balancing act. It has pledged to use its air power to help Assad retake all the territory he has lost in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war and has repeatedly stressed the importance of the country\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nBut it is also working with Turkey and Iran to push for a peaceful settlement it hopes will eventually reshape Syria\u2019s constitution and show that Russia can make peace as well as war.\n\nCritics say Moscow\u2019s efforts are a sham, aimed at yielding a fake political settlement to re-legitimise Assad and attract funds from the European Union and the Gulf to rebuild Syria.\n\nFor Moscow, success would cap a 2015 intervention in Syria that gave Russia new clout in the Middle East and that it is keen to build on, particularly at a time when Washington appears to be distancing itself from the region.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pulled U.S. troops out of the way of Turkey\u2019s offensive earlier this week, drawing bipartisan criticism from members of Congress who credit the Kurds with fighting alongside Americans to defeat Islamic State.\n\nAnkara brands the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists because of their ties to militants who have waged an insurgency in Turkey.\n\nA Turkish operation that drags on too long or gets too messy may upset the Kremlin\u2019s diplomatic efforts.\n\nKremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said on Thursday that while Moscow was sympathetic to Ankara\u2019s security concerns, Putin told Erdogan his forces should tread carefully.\n\n\u201cWe consider it important that all sides show restraint and carefully weigh their practical steps so as not to damage the measures taken to achieve a political settlement,\u201d said Ushakov.\n\nHe pointed to the first scheduled meeting of a Moscow-backed Syrian constitutional committee on Oct. 29 as something that should not be disrupted and said it would be unacceptable for Moscow if civilians suffered in the Turkish offensive.\n\nINTERMEDIARY\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made clear on Thursday that Moscow is already positioning itself for a role as intermediary in resolving the latest twist in Syria\u2019s long drawn-out conflict.\n\nThat could involve brokering talks between Ankara and Damascus, which wants Turkish forces out, and between Damascus and the Kurds, who want a measure of autonomy inside Syria that Assad has so far shown no sign of giving.\n\nLavrov told reporters Moscow would try both, noting apparent enthusiasm for Russia\u2019s services from both the Syrian and Kurdish sides.\n\n\u201cLet us see what we can do,\u201d Lavrov said.\n\nMathieu Boulegue, a research fellow at Chatham House in London, said: \u201cRussia is probably the only player in the room among the grown-ups who can talk with everyone in the room at the same time. Whether it\u2019s Israel and Iran, or with Kurdish forces and Turkey, or Assad and everyone else.\u201d\n\nFor Putin, this would be a significant geopolitical win.\n\n\u201cIf he manages to fix this it would be considered a major political victory,\u201d said Andrey Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think tank close to the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n\n\u201cPutin could argue that the Americans failed to sort this out but we managed it, which implies our approach to the conflict is more efficient than our geopolitical opponents.\u201d\n\nIf Turkey limits its operation to a 30-mile security zone inside Syria and conducts a quick operation, Russia is likely to tolerate it, said Vladimir Frolov, a senior former Russian diplomat.\n\nGiven Russia\u2019s deployment of advanced air defence systems in Syria and its air base there, it has the technical ability to halt any Turkish advance if it wants, he said.\n\n\u201cIf Erdogan wanted to go further into Syria and all but partition it ... Moscow will try to block this by forward deploying Russian observation posts with Russian air cover,\u201d predicted Frolov.\n\n\u201cRussia controls the skies in Syria and Turkey flies its planes now at Moscow\u2019s pleasure.\u201d", "description": "Turkey's incursion into Syria is an opportunity for Russia to dial up its influence in the region as Washington appears to be pulling back, but the risks to Moscow's diplomacy will rise the longer the operation goes on, people close to the Kremlin say.", "authors": ["Andrew Osborn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439357934&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991UY", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
