She repeated Trump\u2019s joke from July 2016 \u2014 which was taken seriously enough by President Barack Obama and the intelligence community to provide a pretext for eavesdropping on the Trump campaign \u2014 in which he said, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 [Clinton] e-mails that are missing.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in May, the former secretary of state told Maddow that since Senate Republicans declined to pass Democrat-sponsored bills to secure American elections against foreign interference, the left should openly enlist the aid of Chinese espionage (transcript via MSNBC):\n\nHillary Clinton: The Republicans in the Senate wouldn\u2019t at all go forward with some of the bipartisan legislation that was meant to secure our elections under orders from the White House. \u2026 Imagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020 on your show, and that person said, you know, the only other adversary of ours who is anywhere near as good as the Russians is China. So, why should Russia have all the fun? And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans, why don\u2019t we ask China to back us. Rachel Maddow: I hereby tonight ask China \u2013 Hillary Clinton: That`s right. And not only that, China, if you\u2019re listening, why don\u2019t you get Trump\u2019s tax returns. I\u2019m sure our media would richly reward you. Now according to the Mueller report, that is not conspiracy because it\u2019s done right out in the open. So, if after this hypothetical Democratic candidate says this on your show, within hours, all of a sudden, the IRS offices are bombarded with incredibly sophisticated cyber tools looking for Trump\u2019s tax returns, and then extracts and them and then passes them to whatever the new WikiLeaks happens to be and they start being unraveled and disclosed \u2013 nothing wrong with that. I mean, if you`re going let Russia get away with what they did and are still doing according to Christopher Wray, the current FBI director, who said that last week, they\u2019re in our election systems. We\u2019re worried about 2020, he said. So, hey, let`s have a great power contest, and let\u2019s get the Chinese in on the side of somebody else. Just saying that shows how absurd the situation we find ourselves in.\n\nNo one called for Clinton to be investigated, much less prosecuted.\n\nThis week, however, Democrats and journalists alike declared that Trump deserved to be impeached for calling, openly, for China and Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption tied to former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate for the Democratic Party nomination.\n\nDemocrats have been searching for Trump\u2019s old tax returns for years, convinced that they contain incriminating or at least politically embarrassing information. In 2017, Maddow produced his 2005 tax return \u2014 which showed he paid a significant amount in taxes.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
