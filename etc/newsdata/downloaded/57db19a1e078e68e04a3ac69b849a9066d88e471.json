We don't want anyone to speak in our name.\"\n\nIraq has a population of just under 40 million people, and is currently the fifth-largest oil producer and exporter worldwide, and the second-largest OPEC producer.\n\nYouth unemployment stands at 25 percent, twice the overall rate, according to the World Bank which adds that an estimated 22.5 percent of the population was living in poverty in 2014.\n\nThe largely spontaneous protests have presented the biggest challenge yet to the Iraqi premier, who came to power a year ago as a consensus candidate promising reforms but whose response to protesters has been seen as tepid.\n\n\"Abdel Mahdi should have come forward with decisive changes, like the sacking of leading politicians accused of corruption,\" said Iraqi analyst Sarmad al-Bayati.\n\nAuthorities restricted access to Facebook and Whatsapp after anti-government demonstrations began on Tuesday, before ordering a total network shutdown on Wednesday.\n\n- 'Promised reforms' -\n\nPolitical and religious rifts run deep in Iraq, and protests are typically called for by party or sect \u2013- making the last five days exceptional, said Fanar Haddad an expert at Singapore University\u2019s Middle East Institute.\n\n\"This is the first time we hear people saying they want the downfall of the regime,\" Haddad said.\n\nSadr, a former militia leader turned nationalist politician, demanded on Friday that the government resign to clear the way for a fresh election supervised by the United Nations.\n\nHis bloc is the largest in parliament, and his intervention sets the scene for a possible showdown with the speaker, who has made his own bid to make political capital out of the protests.\n\nHalbusi sought to allay protesters Saturday by announcing in a news conference a long list of promised reforms over employment and social welfare, but it was not clear he would succeed in appeasing the demonstrators.\n\nIraq's Shiite spiritual leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani used his weekly Friday prayer sermon to urge authorities to heed the demands of demonstrators, warning the protests could escalate unless clear steps are taken immediately.", "description": "The United Nations urged Saturday an end to violence in Iraq, after five days of anti-government rallies marred by the killing of nearly 100 people, mainly protesters.
