But, oh no \u2026 can you see it?\n\nNew season, new camo \ud83c\udf42 Shop the limited edition @TrumpStore collection just in time for Fall: https://t.co/x2bZ34e6hO pic.twitter.com/9b2b04VK3k \u2014 The Trump Organization (@Trump) September 9, 2019\n\nThe four attached pictures all seem to be of lush forest landscapes. In one, First Boy and noted camo fan Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s head floats above the treeline with a facial expression that says, \u201cI\u2019m recently divorced and active on Tinder.\u201d But is there any merch in the shots? If there is, it\u2019s simply too well-camouflaged for my untrained eyes to see.\n\nSuch effectively hidden goods are not cheap. According to the the Trump Store website, which invites you to \u201cEXPERIENCE THE WORLD OF TRUMP,\u201d the collection includes a \u201cZippered Camo Clutch\u201d for $128, a \u201cTrump RealTree Camo Hat\u201d for $36, a \u201cCamo Pattern Belt\u201d for $165, and \u201cTrump Camo Socks\u201d for $32. There is also a dog collar ($38), even though Trump hates dogs. While the items may be expensive, the website does offer free shipping on orders above $99.\n\nCurrently, the Trump Organization is managed by Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric, though, as the New York Times reported earlier this year, the president continues to profit from the business.\n\nAnyway, congrats to the Big Boss Boys on another successful business venture.", "description": "On Monday, the Trump Organization announced in a tweet that it had launched a new, limited edition camo-print line of merchandise for the fall.
