In her new song and video called \"Home To You,\" Welsh singer Cate Le Bon uses a luminous wash of avant-pop to explore one community's search for belonging and a sense of place.\n\nAlongside British director Phil Collins, Le Bon explores the Lunik IX neighborhood in the Slovakian city of Ko\u0161ice. The community is home to a large group of Romani people who, at the hands of multigenerational antiziganism, often live in slums and dilapidated estates, lacking access to housing, employment and basic services like electricity and water. Filmed in a variety of locations, including a bustling flea market and the halls of a music conservatory, Collins splendidly captures moments of shared humanity that echo far beyond Ko\u0161ice's boundaries.\n\nIn a statement to NPR about the piece, Collins says, \"In an age of discord, in which the politics of division and xenophobia \u2014 from Brexit to Trump \u2014 tears communities apart across nations and continents, it is crucial to stand in solidarity everywhere with those subjected to routine discrimination and a denied sense of belonging.\"\n\nThe track is filled with buoyant optimism, balancing sweeping string arrangements and playful xylophone with Le Bon's soaring refrains. For Collins and Le Bon, home isn't a place, it's the warmth of a glance between friends and the beauty of a reciprocated smile \u2014 the sublime power of individuals lifting each other into togetherness.\n\nReward is out May 24 on Mexican Summer.", "description": "The Welsh singer uses a luminous wash of avant-pop to explore one community's search for belonging and a sense of place.", "authors": ["Adelaide Sandstrom"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/04/16/screen-shot-2019-04-16-at-8.15.14-am_wide-2812bce927cadbd3a32d7e491656dfa954c4f495.png?s=1400"}
