Benny Gantz\u2019s rejection of this offer could spell weeks of wrangling after Tuesday\u2019s election, which followed an inconclusive national ballot in April.\n\nGantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White party emerged from the second round of voting this year slightly ahead of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud but lacking the numbers in the 120-member parliament to form a ruling bloc.\n\nNetanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, said in a video clip in which he urged Gantz, the country\u2019s former military chief, to meet him \u201cas soon as today\u201d, that he had pledged during the election campaign to form a right-wing, Likud-led government.\n\n\u201cBut to my regret, the election results show that this is impossible,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBenny, we must set up a broad unity government, as soon as today. The nation expects us, both of us, to demonstrate responsibility and that we pursue cooperation.\u201d\n\nResponding to Netanyahu\u2019s call, Gantz made no mention of the prime minister and said he himself would head a \u201cliberal\u201d coalition, political shorthand for one that excludes the Israeli leader\u2019s long-time ultra-Orthodox allies.\n\nGantz said Israelis were eager for a unity government to end the political uncertainty.\n\nBut he then left it to Moshe Yaalon, a fellow Blue and White leader, to deliver a stinging rejection of a partnership with Netanyahu, citing looming corruption charges against the prime minister, who has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWe will not enter a coalition led by Netanyahu,\u201d Yaalon said, echoing a position Gantz had taken throughout the election campaign and appearing to suggest that an alliance with Likud would be possible if it dumped its veteran chief.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for you to tell Netanyahu, \u2018Thank you for all you\u2019ve done\u2019,\u201d Yaalon urged Likud members - who have shown no sign so far of rebellion.\n\nNetanyahu said he was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d and reiterated his call to Gantz to join him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what the public expects of us,\u201d Netanyahu said about a broad government.\n\nNARROW DIFFERENCES\n\nThe campaigns run by Netanyahu, 69, and Gantz, 60, pointed to only narrow differences on many important issues, and an end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to bring about significant changes in policy on relations with the United States, the regional struggle against Iran or the Palestinian conflict.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and Benny Gantz, leader of Blue and White party, hold hands at a memorial ceremony for late Israeli President Shimon Peres, at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\n\nWith Israeli media reporting 99 percent of votes counted in Tuesday\u2019s election, a Likud-led right-wing, religious bloc looked poised to control 55 of parliament\u2019s 120 seats, with up to 57 going to a centre-left alliance.\n\nOnce all the votes are counted, President Reuven Rivlin, who welcomed Netanyahu\u2019s unity call, will hold consultations with parties that won representation in parliament and give one of its leaders up to 42 days to form a government.\n\nThe political deadlock left former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, head of the far-right Yisrael Beitenu party which has eight seats, as a potential king-maker in the coalition-building. He has called for a secular unity government.\n\nBut Lieberman, on Thursday was unconvinced by Netanyahu\u2019s unity offer, which, in a statement, he said was \u201cno more than a trick and an attempt to paint a false picture to prepare public opinion for a third round of elections.\u201d\n\nGantz is a newcomer to politics. Many voters saw him as a \u201cMr Clean\u201d, an alternative to Netanyahu and the cloud of alleged criminal misdeeds hanging over him.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s call for a broad government preceded a scheduled visit later on Thursday by outgoing U.S. envoy Jason Greenblatt, an architect of President Donald Trump\u2019s as-yet unveiled plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nA senior White House official said Greenblatt \u201cwill have discussions with various parties regarding the U.S.-Israel relationship, regional dynamics and the administration\u2019s peace efforts.\u201d\n\nIsraeli media said Greenblatt may meet both Netanyahu and Gantz.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nPalestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital, have rejected the Trump plan out of hand, accusing the president of pro-Israeli bias.\n\nWith Israeli politics in flux, Netanyahu cancelled his annual speech at the U.N. General Assembly next week, a spokesman said on Wednesday about a visit that might have provided an opportunity to meet with Trump.\n\nNetanyahu highlighted his close ties with Trump in his election campaign. But in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Trump appeared to distance himself from Netanyahu, amid political stalemate in Israel.\n\nHe told reporters he had not spoken to Netanyahu since Tuesday\u2019s ballot and said: \u201cOur relationship is with Israel\u201d.", "description": "Israel's weakened Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saw his offer on Thursday of a coalition with his strongest political rival swiftly rebuffed after failing to secure a governing majority in a tight election.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431667029&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0OL", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
