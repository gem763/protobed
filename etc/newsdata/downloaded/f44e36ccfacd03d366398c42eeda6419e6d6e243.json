Britain replaced these with the British Nationals (Overseas) passport, which allowed visa-free travel to the UK but did not grant the right to live or work in Britain \u2013 earning the BN(O) the nickname \u201cBritain says No\u201d.\n\nHow far will China go to stamp out Hong Kong protests?

He told the FT that \u201ca few\u201d cabinet ministers were supportive of the decision.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People gather to call on the British government to declare the invalidity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Sunday.

She added: \u201cI don\u2019t expect Britain to give me residency, but it might help me to get somewhere else.\u201d\n\nThe passport allows easier entry to many countries which demand a visa for Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport holders.", "description": "After 1997 UK replaced passports giving right of abode with visa-free travel documents with no work rights", "authors": ["Tania Branigan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3797a8a842443564841848d8457d93bbd1ed3ec2/0_307_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f84fa519659c65d012251a57558c7777"}
