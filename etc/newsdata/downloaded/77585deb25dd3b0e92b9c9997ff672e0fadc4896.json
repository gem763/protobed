REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\nBoeing and the FAA are grappling to contain a crisis in the wake of two deadly 737 MAX crashes that have left 346 people dead, forced airlines to ground more than 300 aircraft, and put on hold Boeing deliveries worth more than $500 billion.\n\nBoeing has said it hopes to resume 737 MAX flights later this year, although major U.S. and Canadian airlines have cancelled MAX flights into January or February.\n\nDickson said at a conference of air traffic controllers in Washington that the agency had received the \u201cfinal software load\u201d and \u201ccomplete system description\u201d of revisions to the plane, which was grounded in March.\n\nThe FAA is currently using \u201caircraft production software\u201d in the engineering simulator. The next step is to complete pilot workload management testing and have U.S. and international pilots conduct scenarios to determine training requirements before a key certification test flight.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be several more weeks before we go through all of that part of the process,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got considerable work to do.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Boeing said that last week it successfully conducted a dry-run of a certification flight test. Dickson told Reuters last month the FAA would need about 30 days from the time of the certification test flight before the plane could resume flights.\n\nThe system description is a \u201c500-ish page document that has the architecture of the flight control system and the changes that they have made,\u201d Dickson told Reuters last month.\n\n\u2018SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS\u2019\n\nBoeing shares rose on Tuesday after two sharp days of declines following the release of instant messages on Friday from a former Boeing pilot that the company had withheld from the FAA and which raised questions about what Boeing may have known about a key safety system known as MCAS.\n\nThat prompted an immediate demand for an explanation from the FAA about why the messages were not turned over sooner.\n\nBoeing said on Tuesday it had \u201cmade significant progress over the past several months\u201d in its work to return the MAX to service.\n\nThe changes include an MCAS software update with new safeguards for an anti-stall system at the heart of the two fatal crashes.\n\nDickson said once the steps were completed ahead of the certification test flight \u201cit is a fairly straightforward process to unground the airplane.\u201d He reiterated he would not let the 737 MAX fly again \u201cuntil I am satisfied it is the safest thing out there.\u201d\n\nBoeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg will appear before Congress for two days of testimony next week. He was stripped of his title as board chairman earlier this month.\n\nOn Wednesday, Indonesia plans to share with victims\u2019 families a final report into Lion Air flight 610 that crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta on Oct. 29, 2018, killing all 189 people on board. The report on the 737 MAX crash is expected to be made public later this week.\n\nThe MAX was grounded after a second crash, on March 10, involving Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, which killed 157.", "description": "Boeing Co is making progress towards getting its 737 MAX aircraft in the air again, but the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will need at least several more weeks for review, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443770888&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L15M", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
