Gareth's record over the last few years has been outstanding, but still, it's the other parts of the game.\n\n\"We're on about players switching off... we've seen a few clips there from throw ins.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"And my concern for these players, like (Harry) Maguire, (Michael) Keane, they're mid-20s, and I think sometimes these players don't learn. You can't keep waiting for these lads.\n\n\"Rose gave a performance tonight... my goodness.\n\n\"Someone's got to get hold of that guy. He was, I thought, shocking, abysmal.\n\n\"But I think he'll be the same in another three or four years.\n\n(Image: ITV Sport)\n\n\"Some players don't learn from their mistakes, that's the big problem, and at the highest level you will suffer for it.\"\n\nKeane had earlier singled out Rose when analysing Ondrasek's winner.\n\n\"You're five minutes away from getting a draw, which is not the end of the world, and there's almost a bit of arrogance from England,\" he said.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Danny Rose was never going to win a header, there was more chance of me winning a header than him.\n\n\"And then Maguire, for a guy with his experience, you have to smell and sense danger in a football game, and he strolls out. Get up to people! It just summed up the whole night for England.\"", "description": "England let a one-goal lead slip to lose 2-1 in Prague and suffer a first qualifying defeat in 10 years", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Reuters", "Itv Sport", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563772.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_keaneitv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
