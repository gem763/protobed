Air Chefs, in response, applied for an interdict to prevent the strike, which the court heard on Monday.\n\n\"[The ruling] means that we may not embark on the strike for now as it will not be legally protected,\" said Numsa in a statement. The two sides will return to court in late November to argued why the interim order should not be made permanent.\n\nThe union said it would study the ruling and hoped to reverse the decision. It criticised the decision by Air Chefs to apply for an interdict at what it said was a late stage, saying its members needed to be able to exercise their right to strike.\n\nSAA had said on Sunday that Air Chefs had \"contingencies\" in place to allow catering services to continue if the strike did take place.", "description": "Numsa had threatened to strike to break a deadlock with the SAA subsidiary over the alleged non-payment of anniversary bonuses.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9380/430061396626494a95d1649ded927070.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
