Most of his face is masked with black fabric; only his eyes, tired and steely, are visible below a messy fringe. \u201cI\u2019m worried that I will die and won\u2019t see you any more,\u201d he continues, his hands trembling. \u201cBut I can\u2019t not take to the streets.\u201d\n\nThe nameless demonstrator \u2013 one of many in Hong Kong who have been writing to their loved ones before heading out to confront rising police violence in the city \u2013 was filmed by the New York Times last week in an anonymous stairwell. But he could be almost anywhere, and not only because the walls behind him are white and characterless, left blank to protect his identity.\n\nFrom east Asia to Latin America, northern Europe to the Middle East, there are young people gathering in stairwells, back alleys and basements whose faces display a similar blend of exhilaration and exhaustion. \u201cThe disaster of \u2018chaos in Hong Kong\u2019 has already hit the western world,\u201d the former Chinese diplomat Wang Zhen declared in an official Communist party paper, following reports that protesters in Catalonia were being inspired by their counterparts in Hong Kong. \u201cWe can expect that other countries and cities may be struck by this deluge.\u201d\n\nThe problem for governments is there is no longer a centre ground to snap back to, and their opponents know it\n\nWang is right about the deluge. In the same week that those seeking independence from Spain occupied Barcelona airport and brought motorways to a standstill, Extinction Rebellion activists seized major bridges and squares across London, prompting nearly 2,000 arrests. Both mobilisations adopted tactics from Hong Kong, including fluid targets \u2013 inspired by Bruce Lee\u2019s famous \u201cbe water\u201c mantra \u2013 and a repertoire of hand signals to outwit security forces.\n\nMeanwhile Lebanon has been convulsed by its largest demonstrations in two decades, dozens have been killed during anti-government marches in Iraq, and in Egypt a blanket ban on dissent by President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi\u2019s brutal dictatorship failed to prevent sporadic anti-regime protests breaking out across the country late last month. In the Americas, where Wang once served as a Chinese government envoy, Ecuador, Chile and Haiti are all experiencing citizen uprisings that are virtually unprecedented in recent history, ushering vast numbers of people into the streets \u2013 as well as soldiers tasked with containing them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The prospect of planetary catastrophe in our lifetimes raises the stakes for all political action.\u2019 Extinction Rebellion protest in London. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA\n\nEach of these upheavals has its own spark \u2013 a hike in transport fares in Santiago, or a proposed tax on users of messaging apps like WhatsApp in Beirut \u2013 and each involves different patterns of governance and resistance. The class composition of the indigenous demonstrators in Ecuador can\u2019t be compared with most of those marching against the imprisonment of separatist leaders in Catalonia; nor is the state\u2019s prohibition of protest in London on a par with the repression in Hong Kong, where officers shot live ammunition into a teenager\u2019s chest.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s clear that we are witnessing the biggest surge in global protest activity since the early 2010s, when a \u201cmovement of the squares\u201d saw mass rallies in capital cities across the Arab world, followed by Occupy demonstrations in the global north. Historically speaking, the past decade has seen more protests than at any time since the 1960s. Despite their disparate grievances, some common threads do bind today\u2019s rebellions together. Tracing them may help clarify the nature of our present political volatility.\n\nOne obvious link is also the most superficial: the role played by social media, which has been widely noted in the press. While it\u2019s true that digital technologies have enabled more agile and horizontal forms of organising, the ubiquity of these tools in 2019 tells us almost nothing about what is driving people to take to the streets in the first place. Indeed, in many states, social media is now an instrument of state repression as much as it is a tool of revolt.\n\nThe most significant connection is generational. The majority of those protesting now are the children of the financial crisis \u2013 a generation that has come of age during the strange and febrile years after the collapse of a broken economic and political orthodoxy, and before its replacement has emerged.\n\nOne direct impact of the crash has been a rapid diminishment of opportunity for millions of young people in rich countries \u2013 who now regard precarious work and rising inequality as the norm. At the same time, the aftermath of the crash has cracked the entrenched structures that had evolved to detach citizens from active participation in politics \u2013 be that through authoritarian systems or via an institutional consensus on the inevitability of market logic and technocratic management. Amid widespread economic and social failure, it has become harder than ever for elites to justify power, even on their own terms.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018We need a whole new system, from scratch.\u2019 Anti-government protesters in Beirut.

Afflicted by what the anthropologist David Graeber calls \u201cdespair fatigue\u201d, protesters are putting their bodies on the line because it feels as if they have no other choice \u2013 and because those who rule over them have rarely seemed more vulnerable. Most have spent their lives under the maxim \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d \u2013 and now circumstances have forced them to widen their political imaginations in search of something new. As one poster proclaims in Chile: \u201cIt\u2019s not about 30 pesos, it\u2019s about 30 years.\u201d\n\nFacing them down are states determined to put citizens back in their box and reseal the borders of political participation. The problem for governments is that there is no longer an established centre ground to snap back to, and their opponents know it \u2013 which is why so many of those involved in the current mobilisations will not settle for token concessions from the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe need a whole new system, from scratch,\u201d declared one demonstrator in Lebanon. The crackdown on Catalan separatists by the Spanish government has brought back dark memories of the state\u2019s dirty war in the Basque country in the 1980s and the Franco era that preceded it; troops are marching through city centres in Chile for the first time since Pinochet.\n\nIf Beijing does not budge, the struggle for Hong Kong will last decades | Louisa Lim and Ilaria Maria Sala Read more\n\nIn China, Xi Jinping has claimed that any attempt to divide the nation will result in \u201cbodies smashed and bones ground to powder\u201d. In many places, grassroots victory \u2013 and radical political transformation \u2013 feels to many like the only possible resolution, lending clashes an \u201call or nothing\u201d antagonism and urgency that is hard to roll back.\n\nWhat has intensified this urgency is the backdrop of looming ecological catastrophe. Even where protests are not explicitly about environmental concerns, the prospect of planetary catastrophe in our lifetimes raises the stakes for all political action. \u201cThe kids who are walking out of school have a hugely radical understanding of the way that politics works, and they recognise that our democratic processes and structures as they stand are designed to uphold the status quo,\u201d Jake Woodier, one of the organisers behind the UK climate strike movement, told me this year. \u201cThey know that they will be worse off than their parents, know that they\u2019ll never own a home, and know that on current trends they could live to see the end of humanity. So for them, for us, politics is not a game, it\u2019s reality, and that\u2019s reflected in the way we organise \u2013 relentlessly, radically, as if our lives depend on it.\u201d\n\nThe Cambridge political scientist Helen Thompson once argued: \u201cThe post-2008 world is, in some fundamental sense, a world waiting for its reckoning.\u201d That reckoning is beginning to unfold globally. They may come from different backgrounds and fight for different causes, but the kids being handcuffed, building barricades, and fighting their way through teargas in 2019 all entered adulthood after the end of the end of history. They know that we are living through one of what the American historian Robert Darnton has called \u201cmoments of suspended disbelief\u201d: those rare, fragile conjunctures in which anything seems conceivable, and \u2013 far from being immutable \u2013 the old rules are ready to be rewritten. As long as it feels like their lives depend on winning, the deluge will continue.\n\n\u2022 Jack Shenker is a writer based in London and Cairo.
