The U.S. Commerce Department said this week that China was dumping items such as wooden cabinets in the United States at margins ranging from 4.5% to 262%, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cThe department is also probing whether imports of wood cabinets, vanities and their components from China were being unfairly subsidized and began collecting cash deposits in August to offset the alleged subsidy,\u201d Reuters said.\n\nShrimp imports from China also fell in August, declining 62% in volume and 71% in value year on year, reveals according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nChina has also shown a slowdown in aluminum exports, one of its key metrics, which fell 4.3% in August from the previous month despite a weaker yuan. China is the world\u2019s leading aluminum producer, but last month exported its lowest amount since February.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit with China narrowed in August as exports rose to a five-month high. The trade gap with China shrank to $29 billion from $29.6 billion a month earlier, according to Commerce Department data. Exports increased to $10 billion while imports declined slightly to $39 billion.\n\nThe overall U.S. deficit widened to $55 billion in August, which was higher than expected.\n\nDespite the trade war, China\u2019s fall in exports comes as an anomaly. Shipments grew by over 3% in July, but fell by 1% in August. This was markedly below the 2.1% growth predicted by analysts in a Bloomberg poll.\n\nHigh-level officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, are expected to meet at the White House next week. The talks will be the 13th high-level meetings among there two countries.\n\nThe talks come as President Donald Trump faces impeachment inquiries. This week he publicly asked China to investigate dealings of the family of Joe Biden in the country, though no evidence of wrongdoing has been put forward.\n\nTanner Brown is a contributor to MarketWatch and Barron\u2019s and produces the Caixin-Sinica Business Brief podcast.", "description": "Chinese exports to the U.S. have dropped significantly in 2019, providing increasing evidence that the President Trump\u2019s trade war is taking a toll on the...", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GG015_china__ZG_20180322104654.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
