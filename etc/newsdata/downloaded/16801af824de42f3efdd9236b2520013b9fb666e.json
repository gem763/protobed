(Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nA former basketball player at the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith says he was dismissed from the program because the team\u2019s coach would not allow players to wear dreadlocks.\n\nTyler Williams, a former guard for the Lions who started all 29 games last season and was the team\u2019s second-leading scorer, told The Oklahoman that during his first meeting with new head coach Jim Boone he was told he could not wear his dreadlocks if he wanted to be a part of the team.\n\nUAFS Chancellor Terisa Riley emailed a statement to UAFS students, faculty and staff regarding the incident and said the university is investigating the allegations. Rachel Putman, UAFS\u2019s interim director of public information, told The Oklahoman she expects the investigation to be completed within a few days. Putman said Tuesday the investigation began when the school received the letter from the Williams family.\n\n\u201cThe University of Arkansas-Fort Smith will not tolerate racism or retaliation,\u201d Riley said in the statement Tuesday morning. \u201cWe never want a student to leave the university feeling disrespected or devalued, and this situation serves as a powerful reminder that we must continually assess and work to create an inclusive environment that values all members of our community.\u201d\n\nBoone, now in his 34th season as a collegiate head coach, joined UAFS in April after seven seasons at Delta State University.\n\nWilliams says Boone eventually made an exception for him, saying he could keep his hair because he\u2019s a senior but that he would not recruit players with hair similar to his.\n\nDisturbed by what he had heard, Williams then discussed the meeting with his parents, Reginald and Tiffini. The three of them then met with Boone on Aug. 16.\n\nIn that meeting Boone dismissed Williams from the program.\n\nThe family sent a letter to the university dated Aug. 19 detailing the meeting, even including an audio recording taken by Tyler unbeknown to Boone. (In Arkansas, recording a conversation is legal if the person making the recording is a party to the conversation.)\n\nAccording to a transcript of the recording published by The Oklahoman, Tyler pressed Boone on his comments from their first meeting, including his statement about not recruiting players with his hair style.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t recruit them, but we make it very clear that once they get in here there\u2019s not going to have their hair that way,\u201d Boone says in the recording. \u201cI told you though, because you were here before me, that I didn\u2019t think it was fair for me to tell you you needed to cut your hair, that I was going to let you have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about race. It\u2019s about hair,\u201d Boone says later.\n\nIn the meeting, Tiffini Williams brings up a California law banning discrimination of a student or employee wearing their natural hair.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to live with that. I don\u2019t live in California so I don\u2019t have to deal with that,\u201d Boone replies.\n\nToward the end of the conversation, Boone grants Tyler his release from the team.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m not going to go through all of this. I\u2019m not here for that. You need to go somewhere else,\u201d Boone said.\n\nImages of the letter sent to the university by the Williams family was tweeted by someone claiming to be a UAFS student on Sunday.\n\nAs a student of UAFS, I will not be attending any UAFS basketball games while coach Jim Boone still holds his position. If discrimination like this because of someone\u2019s natural HAIRSTYLE doesn\u2019t infuriate you, then there\u2019s a problem. I encourage students from UAFS to speak up. pic.twitter.com/D2gpWJYRAz \u2014 Julia \u2661 (@JxliaDxver) September 1, 2019\n\n\u201cBoone\u2019s dismissal of Tyler from the program alludes to the understanding that UAFS does not allow players with dreadlocks to have the slightest opportunity to become a player on the UAFS Men\u2019s Basketball team,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAs Boone states, \u2018we do not allow that hair in our program.\u2019 That is an injustice to African American athletes and a major, disappointing stain that UAFS must carry as long as the Men\u2019s Basketball team is under the coaching of Boone.\u201d\n\n\u201cStyles such as dreadlocks, braids, cornrows and, of course, afros, can\u2019t be disentangled from black culture,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cBoone\u2019s action of policing black hair is a form of pervasive racism and bias.\u201d\n\nThe Williams\u2019s aren\u2019t sure how the letter became public but they\u2019re glad this situation is receiving attention.\n\n\u201cWhen we sent it, we sent it just to the school,\u201d Reginald Williams said. \u201cI started seeing screenshots. I couldn\u2019t tell you how it got out there or who put it out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the letter had got out, but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s out and people are seeing my story,\u201d Tyler Williams told The Oklahoman. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo kick someone off the team just because of their hair, that\u2019s not right,\u201d he said. \u201cI just felt disrespected and devalued after he told me that.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 parents told a Houston-based sports show they want Boone removed as coach at UAFS.\n\nBoone\u2019s attorney, Tom Mars, released a statement defending the coach\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cCoach Boone\u2019s attitude about player\u2019s hair styles is admittedly old-school, but it\u2019s not discriminatory,\u201d Mars said. \u201cHe\u2019d feel the same way if a young Larry [Bird] was playing for UA-Fort Smith. That said, he\u2019s going to make it abundantly clear to everyone concerned that he recruits players based on their talent and character. Coach Boone also wants to make clear that, despite what he thinks about personal grooming standards for student-athletes, he doesn\u2019t believe (and never has) that a player\u2019s hairstyle, tattoo sleeves, or body piercings are indicative of their character or their potential to become the next Larry [Bird] or LeBron James.\u201d\n\nThe statement also accuses Williams of having an ulterior motive behind his accusations.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve seen similar accusations made against a head coach by a student-athlete whose real motive is to create grounds for a waiver from the NCAA.\u201d\n\n\u201cTyler wasn\u2019t mistreated, and the issue about his hair had nothing to do with his decision to leave UA-Fort Smith. To the contrary, Tyler Williams transferred to a school in Oklahoma because Coach Boone had recruited some players who were more talented.\u201d\n\nWilliams, an Oklahoma native, played at Northeastern Oklahoma A&M and Allen Community College in Kansas before joining UAFS. Williams announced Aug. 25 that he transferred to Southern Nazarene University in Bethany, Okla.\n\n\u201cI loved it there,\u201d Williams said of UAFS. \u201cThat was my second home. Being told I couldn\u2019t play because of my hair, that hurt.\u201d\n\nMore college sports:\n\nTennessee wide receiver who joked about losing to Georgia State leaves program\n\nYour college football team rolled in its opener.
