USA TODAY\n\nPat Shurmur did not exactly break out the pom-poms to celebrate Saquon Barkley's imminent return to the field.\n\nThe Giants are saving the fanfare for Sunday, but get ready: He's back.\n\nThe New York Giants' star running back, working his way back from a high ankle sprain, was a full participant in practice all week and is not on the injury report, so he is available for Sunday's home game vs. the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nBut Shurmur is playing somewhat coy and not declaring that Barkley will absolutely play. Team sources have told NorthJersey.com and USA TODAY Network Northeast that the Giants (2-4) are preparing to welcome Barkley and tight end Evan Engram back with open arms, regardless of what is being said publicly.\n\nAnd as much as Shurmur may have tried, there is no hiding just how much Barkley means to the Giants and their chances of not only beating Arizona (2-3-1), but getting on a roll during a four-game stretch that could end up defining their season.\n\n\"We'll see if [Barkley] is back, but it's always good when you can get a player of his caliber back in the lineup,\" Shurmur said after Friday's practice. \"I think [his presence] changes things for all of us.\"\n\nHis approach may sound like gamesmanship, but Shurmur insisted it's not.\n\nSaquon Barkley is available to play on Sunday. (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\"I'm not choosing to play a game here,\" Shurmur later added. \"I'm just choosing not to tell you.\"\n\nFrom the moment he suffered a high sprain of his right ankle 26 days ago, Barkley has promised to return with a vengeance. The NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Year missed just three games in a recovery that was initially pegged at four to eight weeks by most observers.\n\nBarkley has played just 23 snaps with Giants rookie quarterback Daniel Jones.\n\n\u201cI always want to be out there,\u201d Barkley said Thursday. \u201cI get up every single morning and live my dream. I feel like a little kid again.\u201d\n\nEngram missed the Giants' 35-14 loss to the Patriots after he sprained the MCL in his left knee. His comeback would also be a significant piece to the Giants' offensive puzzle, considering Arizona's struggles in covering tight ends.", "description": "New York Giants star running back Saquon Barkley, who has been out due to high ankle sprain,\u00a0is available for Sunday's game vs. Arizona Cardinals.", "authors": ["Art Stapleton", "Published P.M.
