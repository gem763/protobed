The system does not protect the players. It\u2019s too much, honestly it\u2019s too much. One other day we will have more recovery than the other teams so it is what it is. Maybe the broadcasters are fans for some clubs.\u201d", "description": "Pep Guardiola says he will be forced to put his Manchester City squad in cold storage over Christmas in the hope of avoiding injuries after accusing the Premier League and television broadcasters of showing scant regard for the welfare of players.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000212210786-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrAjLUMxWirEqyV9fzbDs85kYCgkgCQSuYc9PHGV4C6o.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
