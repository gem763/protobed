It's a very competitive process to get that type of player, he's very expensive for a loan, but he's held in huge regard by Arsenal .\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I don't think there's a safer pair of hands to entrust him to than Marcelo.\n\n\"It was competitive but we back ourselves in those types of situations because, I think we were an unknown entity last year and when we lost out on someone like Harvey Barnes I think we knew we wouldn't lose out on that type of player again because we could put a more compelling case together about why Leeds United is the best place for them to be.\"\n\nNketiah was on the scoresheet for the third time for England Under-21's this season as they drew 2-2 with Slovenia on Friday night.", "description": "Nketiah has been linked with leaving the club after seeing little game time since his loan move", "authors": ["Adam Payne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572333.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Salford-City-v-Leeds-United-Carabao-Cup-First-Round-Peninsula-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
