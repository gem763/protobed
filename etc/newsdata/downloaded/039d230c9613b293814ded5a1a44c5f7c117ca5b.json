And it's not based on science. It's based on prejudice.\u201c #EqualityTownHall https://t.co/6B3kdrsPpk pic.twitter.com/CVKJu9Ywm1 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 11, 2019\n\nThe mayor said as president he would have the FDA revise its rules \u201cbased on evidence, based on individual risk factors and without regard to the prejudice that has driven the current policy.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s appearance Thursday night in Los Angeles was a historic one, as an openly gay presidential candidate being moderated by Anderson Cooper, an openly gay journalist, at a town hall specifically dedicated to issues within the LGBTQ community.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s coming out experience happened after he came back from deployment in Afghanistan and when he had already been elected mayor, he said. The 37-year-old Indiana native told his story of coming out at last month\u2019s Democratic debate, marking the first time in American history that the public had heard a presidential candidate openly talk about their coming out experience.\n\nCooper asked Buttigieg on Thursday what his earlier years were like when he first realizing he was gay.\n\n\"What it was like was a Civil War. Because I knew I was different, long before I was ready to say that I was gay. And long before I was able to acknowledge that that was something that I didn't have power over.\" @PeteButtigieg on his process of coming out #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/mptCaWFkfO \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 11, 2019\n\n\u201cWhat it was like was a civil war, because I knew I was different long before I was ready to say that I was gay and long before I was able to acknowledge that that was something that I didn\u2019t have power over,\u201d he responded.\n\n\u201cI so admire people who are coming out at young ages but also recognize that there\u2019s no right age or right way or right time to come out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people are ready when they\u2019re ready. And for me, I was well into my 20s before I was really ready to say even to myself that I was gay.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has previously talked about his \u201cinternal war,\u201d and his journey toward accepting and being proud of his sexuality.\n\nThe town hall occurred the same day Buttigieg unveiled his sweeping LGBTQ plan, which includes tackling HIV/AIDS, overturning the transgender military ban and securing the passage of the Equality Act, which amends the Civil Rights Act to specifically ban discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nPete Buttigieg Unveils Sweeping LGBTQ Policy To Tackle Inequality\n\nJoe Biden Tells Matthew Shepard\u2019s Mom That Civil Rights Act Includes LGBTQ People\n\nJoe Biden Recalls 'Gay, Gay Bathhouses,' 24/7 Sex And People Are So Confused\n\nLove HuffPost?
