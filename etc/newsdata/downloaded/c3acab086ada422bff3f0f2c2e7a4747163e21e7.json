You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about idiot. You\u2019re just lying\u2026just keep your lying mouth shut.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTrump envoy 'warned Giuliani that Biden corruption claim not credible'", "description": "Rudy Giuliani launched a peculiar attack on New Jersey mayor Cory Booker during a televised interview, in his latest bizarre contribution to Fox News following the move by Democrats to impeach the president.Mr Giuliani has become increasingly embroiled in scandal surrounding Donald Trump over his dealings", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0JUGhE0WZ5VYJHVFPy7y0A--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/9abf51e193076b9afe48c3f40c3a7ef7", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
