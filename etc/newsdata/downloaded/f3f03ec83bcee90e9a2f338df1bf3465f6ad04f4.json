If the plan were implemented next year, the typical beneficiary would receive $1,595 a month, rather than $1,395. It would also increase monthly payments by $200 for certain Supplemental Security Income recipients, who are low-income seniors or people with disabilities.\n\nThe plan fits into the presidential candidate\u2019s broader message demanding \u201cbig, structural change\u201d to large parts of the American economy and would take significant steps in an attempt to address a legacy of inequality that, she said in a Medium post, has hit older women and people of color the hardest.\n\nBy supplementing and growing the program, Warren is also making another play to increase her support among older voters \u2014 the Americans who most reliably go to the polls on election days. The plan arrives just hours before Thursday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Houston, which could spur more in-depth discussions before a national audience.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Elizabeth-Warren-Social-Security-Expansion-Plan Index.Html"], "top_image": ""}
