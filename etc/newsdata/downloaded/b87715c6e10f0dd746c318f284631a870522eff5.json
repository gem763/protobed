Additionally, building upon its launch of a secure data platform for telcos in collaboration with Microsoft earlier this year, TruFactor has introduced new capabilities and APIs to empower data scientists to leverage consumer intelligence safely, securely and seamlessly.\n\nSince the February launch at Mobile World Congress, more than 50 enterprises across industries such as retail, transportation, financial services and urban planning have been utilizing TruFactor\u2019s unique \u201cphygital\u201d graphs to power data science models, applications and platforms.\n\nTruFactor Transforms Delivery of Public Safety Programs and Economic Development Initiatives\n\nHistorically, many agencies and governments have been limited in their ability to harness cloud, AI and mobile technologies. Federal, state and municipal organizations are constantly challenged with competing priorities for budgets, staffing, time and shrinking resources \u2013 all while the economic, demographic and social landscape in their communities evolves daily.\n\nToday, TruFactor customers Inovvo and Cobalt, revealed how they are using the Intelligence-as-a-Service platform to radically transform the delivery of public services and measure the impact of investments.\n\nInovvo, a leader in mobile data and enterprise-class analytics platforms, develops applications to help state and federal agencies use the power of big data to inform decision-making. Through the adoption of TruFactor, Inovvo\u2019s public safety platform receives up to the moment consumer intelligence and insight into local community needs. TruFactor APIs provide feedback on the movements and behaviors of specific demographic populations. As a result, agencies can optimize communication campaigns and the delivery of public safety initiatives and services to constituents.\n\n\u201cOur aim at Inovvo is to enable state and federal agencies with the most advanced technologies that enable them to respond more effectively with tailored outreach and services to support communities in times of need,\u201d said Joseph Khalil, CEO, Inovvo. \u201cOur offerings benefit agencies that have the highest standards for privacy and compliance. The TruFactor platform has exceeded our expectations in delivering secure and unique intelligence that helps us better equip these mission-critical organizations.\u201d\n\nCobalt Community Research is a national non-profit that combines big data with local insights to help municipalities optimize resources. Cobalt is rolling out Visitor360TM, powered by TruFactor. City planners and agencies can now affordably leverage consumer intelligence to identify economic development opportunities and measure the impact of their efforts.\n\n\u201cAs a non-profit ourselves, it was critical to select a platform that we could seamlessly incorporate into our models and trust to meet the rigorous privacy and security policies of public sector clients. TruFactor\u2019s Intelligence-as-a-Service can be applied across applications, including measuring the impact of events and tourism, understanding usage of recreational nodes such as trails, and promoting economic development of downtown areas,\u201d said William SaintAmour, Executive Director, Cobalt Community Research. \u201cWe are creating a new mode of quantitative measurement and representative feedback, so local agencies and governments can show how their efforts are driving results with credible, quality data. It\u2019s an important step forward in evidence-based governance.\u201d\n\nTruFactor Expands Intelligence-as-a-Service Platform with Robust APIs\n\nTruFactor has expanded its offering with a \u201cshovel ready\u201d consumer intelligence platform and APIs to support both ISVs and enterprise customers. Built on a foundation of consumer trust and privacy, TruFactor\u2019s patented anonymization platform ingests, filters and processes over 100 TB of raw information daily. TruFactor\u2019s proprietary AI then transforms this data into a \u201cphygital\u201d consumer graph that bridges physical and digital behavior.\n\nStory continues", "description": "TruFactor, an InMobi Group company, today announced new customer initiatives which showcase how federal and municipal governments are utilizing AI and consumer intelligence to support critical use cases.
