Lorenzo gives his locks for the weekend. USA TODAY\n\nYou can picture Colin Kaepernick dodging tacklers behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nHis receivers sprinting furiously toward the end zone.\n\nHis right arm launching the football skyward as the clock winds down.\n\nBecause it feels like Kaepernick is attempting a Hail Mary, as the clock winds down on his hopes of playing quarterback again in the NFL.\n\n\"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE.\"\n\nColin Kaepernick, shown at the U.S. Open this year, is still interested in playing in the NFL after last appearing in a game in 2016. (Photo: Al Bello, Getty Images)\n\nThose are the words atop a two-page document entitled \u201cFacts to Address the False Narratives Regarding Colin Kaepernick.\" His agent, Jeff Nalley, and PR director, Jasmine Windham, released it Thursday.\n\nFor Immediate Release? Really? Why now?\n\nKaepernick, 31, has been working out five days a week for three years in preparation to play again, according to the two-page document. So what has compelled him and his representatives to go this route?\n\nAs usual, Kaepernick is unavailable to field questions and clarify his position. Granted, his representatives suggest the document is necessary only because the news media has failed to do its job.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many false narratives in the media regarding Colin,\u2019\u2019 the document reads. \u201cWe believe it is important to set the record straight, again. Nothing below is open for interpretation or debate, it\u2019s the truth and nothing else.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThere have been so many false narratives in the media regarding Colin, we believe it\u2019s important to set the record straight, again.\u201d Please read this!! Don\u2019t believe the lies being told about my brother .@Kaepernick7pic.twitter.com/n7J384bT96 \u2014 Eric Reid (@E_Reid35) October 10, 2019\n\nThe truth is, the news media has largely showered Kaepernick with praise since August 2016, when he first knelt during the national anthem in protest of police brutality against African Americans and social injustice. But now, five games into the 2019 NFL season, Kaepernick is taking his case to the public because apparently he feels has no other choice.\n\nHis agent has reached out to all 32 teams \u201cwith little of no response from teams about an opportunity for Colin,\u2019\u2019 according to the document.\n\nFans might assume Kaepernick can\u2019t play in the league because he filed a grievance against the NFL for alleged collusion. But, as the document points out, Eric Reid, Kaepernick\u2019s former teammate, filed the same grievance \u2014 which was settled between the parties \u2014 and he now plays for the Carolina Panthers.\n\n\u201cColin has the same skill set that many of the young mobile quarterbacks flourishing in the NFL right now,\u2019\u2019 reads the document.\n\nTrue, indeed. Although Kaepernick is no longer young.\n\nMany of the \u201cfalse narratives\u2019\u2019 have been corrected or clarified long ago.\n\nFor example, Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers after the 2016 season when the team told Kaepernick it planned to cut him. Not because the 49ers refused to meet any contractual demands.\n\nThe document also presents compelling statistical data showing just how effective Kaepernick was in 2016, when he was recovering from surgery on his right thumb, left knee and on his left shoulder. Of course that was nearly three years ago.\n\nBut here's one bullet point not addressed in the statement: Kaepernick remains unemployed because he risked alienating the league and its fans with his protests. It was a noble thing to do, and the most obvious reason why he has yet to get an offer to return.\n\nSurely there is no better unemployed quarterback on the planet. Kaepernick, after all, has 12,271 passing yards, a 4-2 record in the playoffs and, of course, a Super Bowl appearance.\n\nBut of his 72 passing touchdowns, there was not a game-winning Hail Mary among them.", "description": "Colin Kaepernick's representatives issue release detailing \"false narratives\" regarding quarterback's attempts to return to NFL.", "authors": ["Josh Peter", "Published P.M.
