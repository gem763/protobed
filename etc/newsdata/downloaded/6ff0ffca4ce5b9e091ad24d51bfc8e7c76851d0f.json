(AP) \u2014 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell says the new video review rule for pass interference is working as expected, with only obvious mistakes by officials being corrected.\n\nThrough Week 6, the league has had 44 reviews related to pass interference, and the on-field ruling was reversed seven times.\n\n\u201cI think coaches understood replay was not going to correct every pass interference close call,\u201d Goodell said Wednesday at the close of the two-day owners\u2019 meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to make it perfect, and we\u2019re not re-officiating these plays. The thought process was to correct the obvious and clear error. I think it\u2019s settling out where we expected.\u201d\n\nThe new rule approved as a one-year experiment allows pass interference calls or non-calls to be challenged by coaches and reviewed via replay. But complaints by coaches, players and fans about pass interference persist, with some arguing more calls should be reversed.\n\nWhen the rule was adopted last spring, Goodell said, coaches understood that close calls wouldn\u2019t be changed. The reversal rate so far is 16 percent.\n\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a rule change, there\u2019s a period of adapting, and coaches are testing to see what types of changes are going to be made,\u201d Goodell said.\n\nRich McKay, Atlanta Falcons president and a member of the NFL competition committee, said it\u2019s too early to judge whether interference reviews are being handled properly. But he agreed with Goodell that the goal was to reverse only egregious mistakes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be an obvious error,\u201d McKay said. \u201cIt\u2019s a brand new rule, one our coaches, players, fans and officials are getting accustomed to.\u201d\n\nOfficiating has been a hot topic this season, with controversy about pass interference, the rate of holding penalties and, most recently, a critical call in Monday\u2019s Lions-Packers game that the league admitted was wrong.\n\nThe erroneous hands-to-the-face flag tainted Green Bay\u2019s 23-22 win. But Goodell said such controversy is part of any sport.\n\n\u201cYou never want to see a game where people are talking about officials afterward,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cIt was a great game played by two great teams surprising people about the way they\u2019re playing. And it\u2019s tough. We have to continue to do everything to improve.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s sports. You see it in every sport.\u201d\n\nOn other topics, the commissioner said:\n\n\u2014 Labor discussions on a new collective bargaining agreement have touched on the possible expansion to a 17-game season. The Super Bowl would be one week later, and the season would still start the week after Labor Day. Larger rosters might accompany a longer season.\n\nGoodell said the CBA talks have been productive, but he declined to predict when a deal might be reached.\n\n\u2014 Despite the Miami Dolphins\u2019 historically bad start during a rebuilding effort, Goodell said he\u2019s not concerned about teams sacrificing a season for a high draft pick and diminishing the NFL\u2019s competitiveness.\n\n\u201cThe good news for us is we don\u2019t see that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the league has ever been more competitive. You can see that in teams going from last to first in dramatic fashion.\u201d\n\nGoodell said he doesn\u2019t believe competitiveness would be improved by a lottery for draft picks, and such a change hasn\u2019t been proposed by owners.\n\n\u2014 The league will examine possible reasons for a 44% increase in concussions in exhibition games from 2018 to this year. Concussions in preseason practices fell by 33%.\n\n\u201cWe can look at the video, we can look at the medical information and try to understand the exact circumstances and see if there\u2019s a trend or something we need further changes on \u2014 whether it\u2019s preseason policies or techniques we want to remove from the game,\u201d Goodell said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.
