It\u2019s the closest we currently have to the real thing, but it doesn\u2019t exactly instill confidence for potential buyers having to part with 500 \u20ac.\n\nAs for the description, it cleverly markets all the little snippets we\u2019ve been privy to up until now into a semi-cohesive blurb but doesn\u2019t offer anything new in terms of specifications and features; AMD Radeon Navi based GPU, SSD, new haptic controller, and crazy backward compatibility.\n\nAlthough the release date is very specific, it\u2019s hard to argue it\u2019s not in the right ballpark. Sony\u2019s announcement last month pinpointed a holiday period 2020 launch, and Dec. 4 seems as likely as any other day in the lead up the Christmas period. We\u2019ll reserve judgment on that one until we get official word from the horse\u2019s mouth.\n\nThe Price Has To Be Right\n\nIf there\u2019s any truth to the 500\u20ac / $550 price tag, then Sony may be playing with fire. We immediately get flashbacks to the ill-fated PlayStation 3 pricing announcement at E3 2006. The $500 and $600 price points (differing based on hard-drive capacity), primed competitor Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360 for success, and we all know how that turned out. The stratospheric success of the PlayStation 2 blinkered Sony\u2019s vision for the future and it clearly misread the market.\n\nWhile Sony has done incredibly well this generation both in terms of unit sales and garnering positive public opinion from gamers, an exorbitant PlayStation 5 launch price could quite easily undo all of that hard work.\n\nSony and Microsoft generally manufacture and sell new consoles at a loss only to recuperate costs via game sales later on, so there is a business incentive to raise prices to mitigate the use of much more expensive next-generation components. This makes sense. But the issue lies in whether the average consumer is willing to fork out $550 for an unproven product, especially if Microsoft\u2019s Project Scarlet is priced more competitively.\n\nAs always, early listings aren\u2019t to be taken as gospel so throw in a pint glass-sized dose of salt on this one.", "description": "New listing on Slovakian online shop prices Sony's upcoming console at 500\u20ac, and it may be the worst PlayStation 5 news we've heard yet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/playstation-NTB-3j33.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
