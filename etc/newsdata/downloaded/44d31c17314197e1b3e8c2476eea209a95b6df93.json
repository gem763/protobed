I think we have to worry.\"\n\nMosseri, who took the helm of Instagram a year ago, joined \ufeffFacebook in 2008 and was key to establishing the integrity team, which works to eliminate fake news on the social network. That became an important initiative after the 2016 election, as concerns rose about Facebook's role in allowing the spread of misinformation and enabling foreign interference in U.S. democracy.\n\n\"The accusation that we were behind was fair,\" said Mosseri, in reflecting on 2016. He said the company was late when it came to considering the potential negative consequences of connecting so many people.\n\nFacebook still has a lot of work to do to defend the platform against well-funded people and groups who can use the social network to anger and polarize users through sophisticated methods, Mosseri said.\n\n\"That's terrifying,\" Mosseri said. \"There's progress there, but I'm worried about what we might not know about yet.\"\n\nMosseri said the company needs to put as much care and attention into protecting its services from abuse as it does in creating products that consumers like to use.\n\n\"We're doing that now, and that is a culture shift that is taking years,\" he said. Mosseri said his biggest regret \"is not advocating for that shift years earlier.\"\n\nWATCH: Here's how to see which apps have access to your Facebook data \u2014 and cut them off", "description": "Mosseri said he's nervous about Facebook's ability to navigate the 2020 U.S. presidential election after what he saw four years earlier.", "authors": ["Salvador Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105481204-1538417692145rtsnqtg.jpg?v=1544803080", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
