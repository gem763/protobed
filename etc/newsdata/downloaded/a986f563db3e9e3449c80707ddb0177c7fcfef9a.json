Roberts is a special adviser to Folt, who assumed her position in July.\n\nThe 67-year-old Swann was hired in 2016 despite no significant experience in athletic administration. USC\u2019s athletic department has faced several setbacks during the Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver\u2019s tenure, notably involvement in the widespread college admissions scandal and the college basketball corruption scandal.\n\nSwann also soured many USC fans by backing football coach Clay Helton, who was retained after the Trojans went 5-7 last year in the powerhouse program\u2019s first losing season since 2000. Swann didn\u2019t hire Helton, but he signed the coach to a lucrative contract extension through 2023 after Helton\u2019s Trojans won the Rose Bowl and the Pac-12 in consecutive seasons.\n\nSwann won four Super Bowl rings during nine years with the Pittsburgh Steelers after playing at USC and winning a national championship in 1972. He worked as a broadcaster and dabbled in corporate board jobs after his NFL retirement, and he made an unsuccessful run as the Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania in 2006.\n\nSwann was a surprising choice to replace Pat Haden, another former USC football player and broadcaster who retired in the wake of numerous unsavory revelations about his management of the department.\n\nHaden followed Mike Garrett, yet another former USC football player. The Trojans were enveloped by scandal during Garrett\u2019s tenure, including the harsh NCAA sanctions leveled on the football program for misdeeds surrounding coach Pete Carroll\u2019s wildly successful tenure and Heisman Trophy winner Reggie Bush.\n\nRoberts arrived at USC in 2010 as its vice president of athletics compliance in the wake of the Bush scandal. Roberts turned around the school\u2019s reputation on compliance, and USC\u2019s overall graduation rates and cumulative athlete GPA have been strong in recent years.\n\nFolt also named a search committee to choose USC\u2019s new athletic director. The committee will include two current student-athletes alongside school executives and alumni trustees including communications mogul Jeff Smulyan, real estate investor William McMorrow and billionaire property developer Rick Caruso.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Southern California athletic director Lynn Swann resigned Monday after three tumultuous years on the job at his alma mater.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/usc_swann_resigns_61842_c0-142-2400-1541_s1770x1032.jpg?cef73cf930627bb9253f2c5bc7ae8e40cb2fbd7b", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
