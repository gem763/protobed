Mrs O\u2019Connor died at 49 in February.\n\nNow the Daily Mail has obtained the delayed report into her death, which concludes that North Bristol NHS Trust \u2018failed Julie O\u2019Connor on more than one occasion\u2019.\n\nFinal days: Julie O'Connor, 49, just a couple of days before she passed away in her hospice bed in February. She was repeatedly reassured by Southmead Hospital in Bristol that she did not have the disease\n\nBut both the independent report and the trust\u2019s own inquiry only look back as far as March 2017, when an internal alert was raised after Mrs O\u2019Connor\u2019s private diagnosis. Neither probe looks at her initial mis-read smear test in 2014 or five further visits she made to the hospital.\n\nThe report, published seven months later than planned, does not apportion blame for Mrs O\u2019Connor\u2019s death or ascertain exactly why her illness was missed. It also fails to make a wider analysis of the trust\u2019s pathology or gynaecology department to make sure other women are not at risk of misdiagnosis.\n\nTrainee: Julie in 1990 at the start of her nursing course\n\nThe inquiry is the only independent analysis of the missed diagnosis other than an inquest, which has yet to be scheduled. Mrs O\u2019Connor\u2019s husband Kevin said the findings of the report were \u2018downright obvious\u2019 and did not do enough to protect other women using the trust.\n\nHe said: \u2018This report was a good opportunity to capture the serious failings in cervical screening which have lain dormant for years. Unfortunately the report is a lamentable job from start to finish.\n\n\u2018It misses the root cause and fails to put in place the barriers and safeguards to protect other women. I\u2019m not out to nail anybody, crucify anyone, I can\u2019t change the past \u2013 just God forbid if anything happened to anyone else.\u2019\n\nBefore her illness: Mrs O'Connor with her husband Kevin (left) and children Sophie and Daniel\n\nThe 30-page independent report, which has still not been made public, finds that there were \u2018at least\u2019 two missed opportunities to identify abnormal cervical cells as well as \u2018serious errors and subsequent failings\u2019 in care.\n\nReport author Dr Mike Durkin found that the trust \u2018failed repeatedly\u2019 to carry out a timely investigation. He also concluded that the investigation eventually carried out was \u2018too limited\u2019.\n\nMrs O\u2019Connor went to Southmead for a smear test in September 2014 after moving to Thornbury in South Gloucestershire. It came back negative, although samples later sent for independent analysis showed the slide was \u2018plentiful\u2019 with abnormal cells. A year after the smear test, Mrs O\u2019Connor suffered persistent bleeding and her GP referred her to the hospital for further assessment.\n\nDespite biopsies and medical examinations during five hospital trips over the next two years, she was repeatedly told she did not have cancer.\n\nIn 2017 Mrs O\u2019Connor decided to see a private consultant about her persistent symptoms. It was then that a cervical tumour was identified, with a later biopsy and MRI confirming cancer.\n\nReflecting on the contents of the report, Mr O\u2019Connor, who has not been paid to tell his story, said: \u2018It just doesn\u2019t seem serious \u2013 it just comes across as if s*** happens.\u2019\n\nThe report was initially meant to be completed by the end of January \u2013 before Mrs O\u2019Connor\u2019s death \u2013 but was not handed to her widower until August this year. After Mrs O\u2019Connor\u2019s death, her husband took legal action against the trust, but he dropped the case earlier this year when he realised how much it was costing the NHS. Mr O\u2019Connor is still calling for a wider public inquiry.\n\nNorth Bristol NHS Trust acting deputy medical director Professor Tim Whittlestone said: \u2018We are determined to learn from this and have made significant changes to the way we examine and test for cervical cancer, which I am confident will detect and prevent more cases in future.\u2019", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Julie O'Connor was repeatedly reassured by Southmead Hospital in Bristol that she did not have the disease.
