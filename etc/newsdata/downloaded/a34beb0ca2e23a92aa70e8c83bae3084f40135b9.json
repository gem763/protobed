Public money and access were involved \u2013 and her denials and his evasiveness as details emerge are no substitutes for a formal inquiry.\n\nJohnson cannot plausibly maintain the fiction he never talks about his private life.\n\n(Image: Paul Clarke)\n\nJust last week he revealed at the Tory conference, live on TV, that his mother voted for Britain to leave Europe in the 2016 referendum.\n\nThe truth is, this PM is happy to talk about himself when it works for him and avoids it when he is worried we won\u2019t like the truth.\n\nMagical, Billy\n\nComedian Billy Connolly talking about coping with Parkinson\u2019s will hopefully help other families in a similar position.\n\nAnd we also hope that his telling how \u201cmagical\u201d life is when people show kindness when he requires it, ensures that all of us lend a hand when we see a stranger in need.", "description": "The Health Secretary refuses to rule out patients dying due to drug shortages if Britain leaves without a deal - yet Boris Johnson continues his arrogant dismissals", "authors": ["Voice Of The Mirror", "Image", "Empics Entertainment", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Paul Clarke"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20422426.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Prime-Minister-Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
