Instead, it has removed the Max from its schedule through early February as it waits for Boeing to finish updating the plane and getting approval from federal safety regulators. The airline estimates it will need one to two months for pilot training and other preparation.\n\nStrong travel demand and rising ticket prices helped offset its Boeing issues.\n\nOn Thursday, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. reported third-quarter profit of $659 million, or $1.23 per share. That easily topped Wall Street expectations for $1.09, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nRevenue rose 1% to $5.64 billion despite a 2.9% reduction in passenger-carrying capacity due to the Max grounding. The revenue was in line with analysts' expectations.\n\nThe average fare rose 1.7% to $155.95. A closely watched figure, revenue for each seat flown one mile, rose about 4%. Southwest predicted it will be flat to up 2% in the fourth quarter.\n\nSouthwest expects that passenger-carrying capacity in the fourth quarter will be as much as 1% below the same period last year, an unusual trend at an airline that has grown rapidly through much of its history.\n\nIn trading before the market opened Thursday, Southwest shares were up 86 cents, or 1.6%, to $54.10.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
