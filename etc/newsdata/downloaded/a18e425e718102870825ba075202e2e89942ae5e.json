Chicago Police Department officials have since said Smollett planned the attack himself and demanded the actor pay for the investigation's costs.\n\nSmollett was initially charged with 16 felony counts, which the country state attorney dropped, leading to outrage and sparking the current lawsuit. A special prosecutor was appointed in August to examine why the charges were dropped.\n\nA spokesman for the city\u2019s law department declined to comment to The Hill on Tuesday, saying the office does not comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nWilliam Quinlan, one of Smollett's lawyers, meanwhile, told The Hill that the judge's ruling is \"not surprising,\" noting that dismissal is a \"very high bar to reach.\"\n\n\"The pleadings are just the city\u2019s side of the story,\" Quinlan said. \"Now, Mr. Smollett will get to present his side of the case.\"\n\n\"Mr. Smollett has always maintained his innocence and is eager to have the complete facts of the case come out,\" he added. \"He looks forward to taking depositions and otherwise bringing to light many of the facts that have been overlooked in the court of public opinion to date. Mr. Smollett is confident that once the full story is available he will be vindicated.\"\n\nThe Hill has also reached out to the Chicago Police Department for comment.", "description": "A federal judge on Tuesday declined to dismiss the city of Chicago\u2019s lawsuit against former \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/smollettjussie_03142019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
