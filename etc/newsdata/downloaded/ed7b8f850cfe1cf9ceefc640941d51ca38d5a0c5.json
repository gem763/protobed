But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. So I'm thrilled with what he said.\"\n\nPopovich is one of the NBA's most outspoken coaches, never shy to offer opinion on political matters \u2014 he is a staunch opponent of President Donald Trump \u2014 or social causes. Many NBA coaches have remained largely mum on the current situation with China. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni refused to answer questions on the topic after his team's game in Tokyo on Tuesday, Golden State coach Steve Kerr said he wanted to educate himself on the situation before speaking out, and Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers didn't go too deeply into specifics when asked his opinion.\n\n\"That's what this country is about: freedom of speech,\" Rivers told reporters at Clippers practice Tuesday. \"And we should always have freedom of speech. But ... freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences.\"\n\nOther coaches have said they are simply too busy getting ready for the season to fully dive into the topic.\n\n\"Training camp's a pretty immersive time for us to get into game film and training, etc.,\" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. \"I have a lot of faith in the leadership of the NBA that they know what they're doing to take care of these matters.\"\n\nBut Popovich spoke at length about Silver's remarks. He compared their significance to two other moments that he finds significant from Silver's career \u2014 how the NBA banned former Clippers owner Donald Sterling over racist comments, and how the league has been a leader in supporting the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"Adam is a very progressive leader,\" Popovich said. \"We all remember how he handled the situation with the former owner of the Clippers, which made everybody proud because it was the right thing to do. A couple years ago \u2014 I can't remember, time goes by quickly, two, three, four years ago \u2014 I was walking the streets of New York City during the Gay Pride parade and I turned around and here comes a float and Adam's standing on the float with a big sign in support of LGBTQ and I felt great again, just like I did with the Clipper deal.\n\n\"And then we come out strongly for freedom of speech. I felt great again.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
