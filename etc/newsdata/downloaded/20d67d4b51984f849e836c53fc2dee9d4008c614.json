He then laid out the penalties for failing to meet federal requirements, which include losing federal highway dollars. California is expected to receive about $8 billion in fiscal years 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe Trump administration has been picking fights with California over environmental regulations recently. Last week the administration said it will revoke a waiver that allows California to set stricter car emission standards.\n\nA senior EPA official said the two actions were not linked and that California is the focus now because it represents the largest share of backlogged plans. Even though other states have similar backlogs, the administration has not sent letters to them.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has been critical of President Trump's environmental record and challenged the administration in court. Newsom called Wheeler's letter a \"brazen political stunt.\"\n\n\"The White House has no interest in helping California comply with the Clean Air Act to improve the health and well-being of Californians. This letter is a threat of pure retaliation,\" Newsom says.\n\nLaw California Pushes Back On Trump Administration Over Emissions Standards California Pushes Back On Trump Administration Over Emissions Standards Listen \u00b7 4:07 4:07\n\nFormer EPA officials say they were surprised Wheeler sent the letter to California.\n\n\"I just think it's so ironic that the EPA is chastising California, which has been so progressive in working towards cleaner air, more than any other place in the country,\" says Janet McCabe, who was an EPA official during the Obama administration and now directs Indiana University's Environmental Resilience Institute.\n\nMcCabe says it's unusual for the EPA to publicly criticize a state in this way. She says typically the agency would communicate with a state privately and work out differences to encourage a cooperative rather than adversarial relationship.", "description": "The Trump administration threatens to cut federal highway dollars for California over air pollution.", "authors": ["Jeff Brady"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/24/ap_19262664376194_wide-e4b30d72cc935d5dd7d7af26ae761fdcc36e65be.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
