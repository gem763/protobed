This time, however, he predicted what would happen if something actually happens with their \"phony witch hunt.\"\n\nThere will be a \"recession depression like the country has never seen,\" Trump said, adding that \"there will be repercussions in the market.\"\n\nHe was adamant that he \"did nothing wrong\" and that it's the Democrats who \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nBut, the press questioned whether his own administration was undermining him. For instance, the now infamous opening statement of Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor in the impeachment inquiry alleged that the president pressured Ukraine to spy on Joe and Hunter Biden, and that Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine. It sure sounded like Taylor was accusing Trump of quid pro quo.\n\nTrump rejected Taylor's account and referred to him as a \"Never Trumper.\"\n\nNever Trumper Republican John Bellinger, represents Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor (who I don\u2019t know), in testimony before Congress! Do Nothing Democrats allow Republicans Zero Representation, Zero due process, and Zero Transparency.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nA reporter reminded Trump that it was his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who handpicked Taylor to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, to which Trump could only sigh.\n\nWhen I pointed out that Pompeo hired Taylor to be the top diplomat in Ukraine, Trump said: \"Hey, everybody makes mistakes.\" \u2014 Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) October 25, 2019\n\nPresident Trump on Ambassador Bill Taylor: \"Here\u2019s the problem. He\u2019s a never-Trumper and his lawyer is a never-Trumper.\" pic.twitter.com/luLCcfEx75 \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 25, 2019\n\nHe then expanded on his feelings about Never Trumpers, calling them \"bad people.\"\n\nBut, he had some compassion for \"recovering\" Never Trumpers. Those individuals, he explained, came around because they \"learned how to win through me.'\"\n\nA few days earlier, he called Never Trumpers \"human scum.\"\n\nThe president predicted that the real scandal will drop once the DOJ finishes its investigation into the investigators responsible for the Russian collusion probe.", "description": ".10/25/2019 17:56:25PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/169/49d3af8c-7366-4dcb-9418-7fc5dc0998d6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
