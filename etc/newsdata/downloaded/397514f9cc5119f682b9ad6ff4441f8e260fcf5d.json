But I'm not looking further than my dream right now.\"\n\n", "description": "Sy Lerman reports on Gordon Igesund's \"dream\" to build a soccer team from players as young as five at the academy he has opened in Cape Town.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/697/28bef1c5aedd450da5fccc82d45b5b86.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
