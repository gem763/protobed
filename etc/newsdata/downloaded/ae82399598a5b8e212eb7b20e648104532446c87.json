If we look at the co-relation between the moves of Indian equity indices, and Indian Rupee; we find that the weekly closing level will be interesting to analysis amid the growing probabilities of Sino-U.S. trade deal.\n\nNo doubt that the prices of the safe-haven traded lower on Friday in Asia after both China and the U.S. indicated that trade talks between the two sides may resume, but still the final comments from the U.S. President yet to reflect the real intention behind the \u201cDeal\u201d or \u201cNo Deal\u201d; which turns the sentiments of global equity investors to remain under growing anxiety about the final outcome.\n\nGao Feng, spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said that Beijing would not retaliate for now against U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff moves. Gao also said China is \u201cwilling to negotiate and collaborate in order to solve this problem with calm attitude,\u201d but added it was important for Washington to cancel a tariff increase. \u201cChina has plenty of means for counter measures, but under current situation, the question that should be discussed right now is about removing the U.S.\u2032 new tariffs on $550 billion Chinese goods to prevent escalation of the trade war,\u201d Gao said.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump said the U.S. and China are set to have trade talks later in the day \u201cat a different level.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a talk scheduled for today at a different level,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox News Radio without elaborating on what \u201ca different level\u201d means. The news put on track for a small weekly loss despite a strong month.\n\nOn the other hand, U.S. President Donald Trump once again attacked the U.S. Federal Reserve following the release of the data. \u201cThe Economy is doing GREAT, with tremendous upside potential! If the Fed would do what they should, we are a Rocket upward!\u201d he said. Trump has repeatedly called for the Fed to pursue a more aggressive path of policy easing. The central bank is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points in September in order to support the economy in the face of trade uncertainty.\n\nFinally, I find that all this developments may keep the prevailing exhaustion in global equity markets for some more time amid growing volatility due growing fear of global economic slowdown. No doubt that the Nifty 50 struggled a lot to retain it\u2019s opening levels, but selling at every upward move is evident enough to reflect the growing quantum of sell off; which reflect the level of growing pressure on Indian rupee due to increased short position in currencies of most of the Asian countries.
