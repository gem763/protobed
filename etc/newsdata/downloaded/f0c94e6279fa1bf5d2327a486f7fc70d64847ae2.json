The men's barristers say all acts in Wang's hotel room were consensual.\n\nThe woman, who worked on a production with the pair but can't be publicly identified, told the jury on the night of the alleged rape she was in a CBD karaoke bar with some of the cast and crew.\n\nWang sat down next to her, put his arm around her and later tried to kiss her.\n\n'I moved my head away from him and I didn't want him to kiss me and he asked me 'kiss me',' she said, before tearing up.\n\nEdited CCTV footage from the karaoke bar shows Wang seated next to the woman with his arm around her on several occasions over two hours.\n\nShe said having Wang's arm around her didn't 'feel weird' at first but she later felt uncomfortable - getting up to go to the toilet several times in the hope someone else would sit next to him.\n\nThe woman, Wang, Gao and other cast and crew later travelled back to the Shangri-La, where the Crown alleges the actor and producer raped her several times.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Jing Wang and film star Yunxiang Gao, both 37, have pleaded not guilty in the New South Wales District Court to multiple charges of rape and indecent assault.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/01/20356612-0-image-a-12_1572400665498.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
