They\u2019re here to see Brad Parscale.\n\nParscale, President Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, has a message for the 60 or so Trump supporters on hand at the Sept. 17 gathering. \u201cVolunteering is how you win,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t expect just money on TV and [a] digital program is going to win this again.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign is betting big on grassroots organizing in 2020, a significant change from his unorthodox and thinly staffed 2016 campaign. They\u2019ve created the Trump Victory Leadership Initiative, a training program for volunteers and organizers modeled on the fellowship program Barack Obama\u2019s campaign pioneered in 2008 and 2012. According to Parscale, the Trump campaign had 700,000 trained volunteers in 2016. This time, they\u2019re aiming for 2 million. In 2016, Trump\u2019s team had 5,000 trained fellows, a more experienced type of volunteer, Parscale says. They\u2019re already at 30,000 for the 2020 election.\n\nThe introduction of a new volunteer training program is the clearest sign yet that the Trump campaign is trying to evolve from its bare-bones, rally-and-TV focused 2016 roots to a professional campaign operation that marries big money, a national field program and local coordination. It carries opportunities for Trump\u2019s campaign, which is focused on boosting turnout among the President\u2019s core supporters, and has time and party resources on his side.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

We can actually afford to have a Cadillac operation.\u201d\n\nAs they build their program, Parscale and others on the campaign and at the RNC have been studying the book \u201cGroundbreakers: How Obama\u2019s 2.2 Million Volunteers Transformed Campaigning in America,\u201d a senior campaign official told TIME. It\u2019s not the first time Republicans have turned to Obama\u2019s historic campaign for tactical guidance. In 2016, for example, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz gave copies of Obama\u2019s former campaign manager David Plouffe\u2019s book to his senior presidential campaign team, telling them to \u201cnakedly and shamelessly emulate this.\u201d\n\nSome veteran Obama hands are skeptical that Team Trump can pull it off. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say you read a book and that you\u2019re going to do a training,\u201d says Jeremy Bird, president of 270 Strategies and the former national field director for Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to actually embody that.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s still some stigma among Republicans about the very idea of this type of campaigning. \u201c\u201dCommunity organizing\u201d?!\u201d one Trump campaign official joked in a text message to TIME. \u201cWho are we, Democrats?!\u201d\n\nBut the campaign believes it has an opportunity to marry Obama\u2019s organizing blueprint to the intensity of Trump\u2019s core supporters. They\u2019re eyeing people like Michelle Garcia Holmes, who has run for Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico and Mayor of Albuquerque. Holmes was a lifelong Democrat, she says, until she voted for Trump in 2016. She went to Trump\u2019s rally in Rio Rancho, N.M., Monday night and to Tuesday\u2019s event at the winery. Now she wants to get more involved. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she says when asked Tuesday if she\u2019s planning to volunteer for Trump this cycle.\n\nSome former Obama aides worry that Republicans have caught up to Democrats when it comes to organizing. Joy Cushman, a deputy field director for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, published an op-ed in the New York Times in August titled, \u201cThe Trump Campaign Knows Why Obama Won. Do Democrats?\u201d Cushman wrote: \u201cI fear that the wealthy elites on the left have less respect than ever before for the strategies that got Mr. Obama elected. If Democrats want to win in 2020, they must get back to investing in the power of everyday people through organizing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Parscale and other members of the Trump team are spending time in blue states like New Mexico, imploring people to sign up to volunteer and get trained. \u201cRemember, winning elections is not about what I do on my computer or what we do across the country,\u201d Parscale, the digital media director for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, tells supporters in New Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s what you do in neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nThe campaign\u2019s data shows that there is a 15% lift in turnout in an area where the campaign has fully built out a neighborhood team leader model. Parscale asked the supporters at the winery to text a campaign number, send an email or sign up online, so the campaign can build its list, and tells them to \u201cchoose your weapon\u201d of social media platform. Those who want to go the extra mile to become more skilled volunteers or organizers can participate in Trump Victory Leadership Initiative trainings. The sessions last about six weeks and teach new organizers how to do voter registration, how to use an app to mobilize volunteers, and how to go door-to-door in exercises that simulate a Super Saturday.\n\nObama\u2019s team stressed this type of formal, experiential training. \u201cThe biggest difference is we really invested the staff and the resources to make a training program that took people all the way through,\u201d says Bird, \u201cas opposed to what I had seen before, which was trainings that were one-off sessions that were done now and again.\u201d In the Obama fellowship program, organizers were taught policy and messaging and how to effectively manage volunteers, as well as learning tangible on-the-ground skills, according to Bird.\n\nThis type of investment in volunteers and relational organizing presents its own challenges for any campaign. Having a large network of organizers and volunteers is messier, harder to control and requires more trust in people on a local level.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s supporters say they\u2019re up to the challenge. Standing beside a row of grapevines after listening to Parscale, Sally Gomez, 66, is feeling inspired after the morning\u2019s event. \u201cI sure will,\u201d she says when asked if she\u2019s planning to volunteer. \u201cI\u2019m a senior citizen, so I do have the time, so whatever they need me to do I\u2019ll be glad to do.\u201d\n\nWhich is what the Trump team is counting on. Registering new voters is \u201cgoing to be a big part of what we are doing,\u201d says Carr, the campaign\u2019s political director. \u201cRepublican operatives, the GOP, the national party, we got away from voter registration. That is not something we are going to overlook this cycle.\u201d\n\n\u2014With reporting by Brian Bennett/Washington\n\nWrite to Tessa Berenson at tessa.berenson@time.com.", "description": "The President's re-election campaign says it's modeling its organizing program after the one that lifted Barack Obama to the White House", "authors": ["Tessa Berenson Los Ranchos De Albuquerque"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/trump-china-tariffs-twitter.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
