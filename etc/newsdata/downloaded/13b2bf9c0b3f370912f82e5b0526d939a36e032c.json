But events in Westminster since the referendum have steadily destroyed trust between the capitals.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson's demand to change the Brexit deal, negotiated over two years by his predecessor Theresa May and the remaining 27 EU countries, has only hardened Dublin's commitment to it.\n\nBritain's approach to the negotiations, exacerbated by a tumultuous political landscape in Westminster, and the breakdown of government in Northern Ireland, have soured relations, eroding the good faith that underpinned peace talks in the 1990s. As trust has trickled away, so too has the appetite to accommodate the shifting U.K. position, uniting Ireland's political class behind their red lines.\n\nMost contentious is the so-called backstop, an insurance policy in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement designed to ensure no hard border ever emerges on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just being asked to tweak it, to change it. We\u2019re being asked to remove it completely. To take away a guarantee of peace, a guarantee to protect the Good Friday Agreement and everything that comes with it, take away a guarantee to protect our all-island economy, take away a guarantee that no border would emerge on the island,\u201d Irish EU Affairs Minister Helen McEntee told POLITICO.\n\nWhen Varadkar took office, his first foreign visit was to Downing Street, just five days into the job.\n\n\u201cAll of those issues are so important to us. They\u2019re important to the U.K., and they\u2019ve said themselves that they\u2019re committed to doing all of those things. So if that\u2019s the case why are they asking us to remove it?\u201d\n\nThe Irish government this week doubled down on its plans for a no-deal exit. For Ireland, giving in to British demands now would be accepting permanent negative consequences, while no deal would be terrible but temporary; and Britain will eventually have to accept the backstop \u2014 or something like it \u2014 if it ever wants a trade deal with the EU.\n\n\"Unfortunately, given political developments in the U.K., there is a significant and growing risk of no deal. We don\u2019t wish to see a no-deal Brexit and we will continue our efforts to avoid one, but not at any cost,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Thursday. \"Unlike some, I see no upsides to no deal. I do fear it. But I am prepared for it.\"\n\nNot so 'Love Actually'\n\nThe depth to which British-Irish relations have fallen may be on display when Johnson travels to visit Varadkar in Dublin on Monday.\n\nWhen Varadkar took office in June 2017, his first foreign visit was to Downing Street, just five days into the job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first time in this building so there\u2019s a little thrill in it as well. We spoke on the way in and I was reminded of that famous scene in \"Love Actually\" when Hugh Grant does his dance down the stairs,\u201d a visibly delighted Varadkar told a press conference back then.\n\nVaradkar and Theresa May both spoke optimistically about achieving Brexit while maintaining the open border, protecting the Irish economy and peace. They even expressed hopes that the collapsed Northern Ireland administration could soon be back up and running.\n\n\u201cIt is my first visit overseas and I really want to thank the prime minister for facilitating it at very short notice, but it does I think underline and emphasize the strength and closeness of the relationship that exists between our two countries,\u201d Varadkar said.\n\nBy contrast, Johnson has spoken twice with Varadkar by phone since taking office. An unusually long time lapsed before he made the customary call to Dublin after becoming prime minister in July. The second was in the wake of a bomb attack in Fermanagh, a sign of worsening destabilization in Northern Ireland.\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and U.K. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay clashed when then met last week in Paris. And while Downing Street has presented Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin as being part of Brexit negotiations, the Irish government has insisted it does not engage in bilateral talks on the U.K.'s exit.\n\nNorthern Ireland fault line\n\nIn talks with Brussels, the U.K. has indicated it wants to strip out much of what was agreed between May and the EU in December 2017.\n\nEU27 diplomats have been briefed that the U.K.\u2019s plan to strike out the backstop includes removing most of the parts of the Withdrawal Agreement that Ireland sees as guaranteeing the continued functioning of an all-Ireland economy. Asked by Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer on Thursday if he could confirm the government\u2019s commitment to the joint report, a key document that served as the blueprint for negotiations about the Irish border, Barclay declined.\n\n\u201cThe 2017 joint report was the foundation of a deal with the EU that would avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland,\u201d Starmer told POLITICO. \u201cThe Brexit secretary\u2019s refusal to stand by that agreement is deeply concerning and reveals the government\u2019s willingness to backtrack on the solemn commitments it made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago.\u201d\n\nWhile Westminster has been distracted by Johnson\u2019s charge toward an election, the profound implications of the London-Dublin fault-line \u2014 particularly for Northern Ireland \u2014 are slowly beginning to surface.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith admitted to MPs that talks with political parties, brokered by London and Dublin, to restore power-sharing in Belfast are now running against the clock ahead of the U.K.\u2019s October 31 departure date. In the event of any form of Brexit, but particularly no-deal, it would not be feasible for Northern Ireland to continue to be governed by civil servants alone, he said.\n\nPatience also wore thin when it became apparent May was not always able to deliver on commitments her team had negotiated for in Brussels.\n\n\u201cThey cannot take the proactive decisions that are needed on public services or the economy in the run-up to 31 October,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf we cannot secure the restoration of an [Northern Ireland] executive, we will pursue the decision-making powers that are needed at the earliest opportunity.\u201d\n\nThat means some form of direct rule from London. Such a move, while viewed by Whitehall as a practical necessity given the prime minister\u2019s Brexit stance, risks destabilizing an already tense political situation in Northern Ireland. Nationalist parties were quick to condemn Smith\u2019s comments as signaling a \u201cpower grab\u201d by the U.K. government.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nDublin was initially optimistic about Brexit negotiations. The rhetoric in public statements coming from London was positive and the close result of the 2016 referendum was interpreted as an indication Britain would not pursue a hard break from the EU.\n\nOver time, a series of events unpicked Dublin\u2019s faith in London.\n\nIn her Lancaster House speech of January 2017, May adopted a much harder interpretation of Brexit than expected, committing to leaving the single market and customs union. Customs procedures would now be inevitable somewhere between Britain and Ireland.\n\nMay\u2019s public statements increasingly appeared to countenance leaving without a deal at all. \u201cNo deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d became her most memorable phrase.\n\nPatience also wore thin when it became apparent May was not always able to deliver on commitments her team had negotiated for in Brussels because of domestic political pressure.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t enter into negotiations with an entire parliament, it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d McEntee said. \u201cThe EU has negotiated this in good faith over two and a half years \u2026 you can\u2019t keep shifting the goal posts, which is where we are now, in that we are being asked to essentially wipe the slate clean on two and a half years of negotiations \u2026 and replace it with nothing.\u201d\n\nHolding onto the backstop\n\nSince the referendum, there has been cross-party collaboration on working to mitigate Brexit, in the spirit of confronting a national emergency. Irish parliamentary unity on Brexit remains near-total.\n\nThere is no opposition pressure to give in on the backstop. It helps that Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael party is in a governing arrangement with the largest opposition party, Fianna F\u00e1il. But the current deal even enjoys support from Sinn F\u00e9in, normally the party most intractably opposed to Fine Gael.\n\n\u201cAll parties, the EU, the Irish government and the D\u00e1il [the lower house of the Irish parliament] have been clear and consistent that there can be no renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop it contains,\u201d a Sinn F\u00e9in spokesman said.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s major demand to the government is that it should support a referendum on the unification of Ireland in the case of a no-deal Brexit. While all parties are in theory supportive of eventual unification, Varadkar strongly opposes any calls for a border poll at present, seeing these as destabilizing and ill-timed.\n\nThe Irish government says it has yet to be shown any proposals that obviate the need for a border. Suggestions put forward by Britain, such as technological solutions, streamlined customs and trusted trader schemes, would entail the existence of border checks.\n\nEveryone is clear, gentlemen\u2019s reassurances won\u2019t do.", "description": "Boris Johnson heads to Dublin with relations at a low point.", "authors": ["Naomi O'Leary", "Charlie Cooper", "Annabelle Dickson", "Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166750741-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
