But we know the talent is there.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve seen, towards the end of [last] season, what Fred can give us: the PSG game, the Arsenal and Man City games. And, of course, he\u2019s one that we hope is going to take another step this season. Hopefully, missing 10 days of our pre-season [to get married] won\u2019t set him back too much.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Jose Mourinho was not in favour of the signing of Fred but reportedly felt Manchester United\u2019s transfer team would not bring in a new midfielder if he vetoed the move....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178207638_1570838658.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
