At Gucci\u2019s spring 2020 runway show, models wore fake lashes applied directly on top of their brows, courtesy of makeup artist Thomas de Kluyver.\n\nFor some of the models \u2014 who had walked on a moving runway, underneath harsh, fluorescent lighting \u2014 the layered lashes created an exaggerated doll-like, Twiggy look. On others, the lashes appeared more surreal and jarring, no doubt due in part to the juxtaposition of the fuzz against their bare faces.\n\nThe only other somewhat noticeable makeup was a thick layer of clear lip gloss, from Gucci\u2019s Baume \u00e0 L\u00e8vres shade 1 in Joslyn Clair. According to the brand\u2019s Instagram, the makeup was left bare in order to highlight \u201cthe unique and natural beauty of each model.\u201d\n\nHairstylist Paul Hanlon paired a variety of looks, including TERF bangs, messy bobs and geometric braids, with de Kluyver\u2019s simple complexions. The collection aimed to \u201callow people to walk through fields of possibilities, cultivate beauty, make diversity sacrosanct and celebrate the self in expression and identity,\u201d the brand tweeted.\n\nPhoto: John Phillips/Getty Images for Gucci\n\nPhoto: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images for Gucci\n\nIf you need something easy but effective for Halloween, consider taking a page from Gucci\u2019s runway and aiming a little higher when you apply your falsies.\n\nStay in touch.
