A cease fire deal being hailed as a victory by Trump and Vice President Pence gave Erdo\u011fan something he\u2019s wanted for years \u2014 a zone in Syria that Turkey will have control over, essentially extending the Turkish border 20 miles south.\u201cI don\u2019t understand what the Turks gave up, and I don\u2019t think they gave up anything,\u201d said Eric Edelman, former U.S. ambassador to Turkey under the George W.
