Bullion set a six-year high of US$1,557 an ounce last month.\n\nCentral banks have cut interest rates this year to cope with slow-growth economies impacted by uncertainties such as Brexit and U.S.-China trade negotiations, prompting investors to seek safe havens such as gold.\n\n\u201cDespite the strong move, we remain bullish on gold,\u201d says the report by lead author Carey MacRury. \u201cWith $15 trillion in negative-yielding debt globally and amidst a global easing cycle (despite historically low rates), we believe gold is well-positioned to move higher.\u201d\n\nCompared to past bull markets in gold, which averaged gains of 109 per cent, the current cycle shows gold is only up 48 per cent so far, suggesting it has room to increase in value, the analyst said.\n\nOther factors in bullion\u2019s favour are that generalist investors mostly have room in balanced portfolios to own more, the metal remains in demand by emerging market central banks, and its supply likely peaked while there\u2019s lack of investment and funding for exploration and development to produce more, Canaccord Genuity said.\n\nGold has also been tracking the ups and downs of the U.S.-China trade negotiations, with the recent news of a preliminary agreement shaving off some of the yellow metal\u2019s price. Canaccord Genuity said a trade deal would be a temporary setback for gold price advances and is a risk to its forecast.\n\nHowever, many observers project tougher trade talks ahead when negotiations boil down to contentious issues.\n\n\u201cUncertainty remains over the longer-term ramifications of the now 15-month old trade war between the U.S. and China,\u201d Toronto-based Haywood Securities Inc. wrote in a report. \u201cComments by the IMF chief and the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair warned of further risks to the global economy, with the latter suggesting further interest rate cuts could be triggered in the next few months.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a risk to the higher gold price forecast in that there\u2019s a discrepancy in the projected extent of interest rate cuts between what the market expects \u2014 about 100 basis points over the next 12 months \u2014 and what the Fed has indicated will be fewer and smaller cuts. If the Fed keeps to that concept, the price of gold would retreat, Canaacord Genuity said.\n\nAll this lies on top of a slow-growth macroeconomic setting where negative yields dominate to the point that deflation is of a greater concern among developed countries than inflation.\n\n\u201cGold is the sound alternative in a negative-rate world where flat currencies and government bonds are losing value in real terms,\u201d according to the Canaccord Genuity report. \u201cWe note that yields have been falling for decades and despite the recent cyclical high, yields are back to near all-time lows.\u201d\n\nLondon-based Standard Chartered Bank believes that interest from retail investors as opposed to institutions will drive gold prices higher, perhaps to US$1,570 in the fourth quarter of next year even though exchange traded funds are nearly touching record levels.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve seen ETF holdings and tactical investment hitting elevated levels, like peak highs, we think retail demand is really going to be what drives the next leg higher,\u201d analyst Suki Cooper told Bloomberg. \u201cRetail investors almost want confirmation of further rate cuts, some weakness in the equity markets before they move into gold. The next leg higher in 2020 is going to be led by the retail side.\u201d\n\nJames Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., told Bloomberg that gold will end next year at US$1,605 as easier monetary policy globally, low yields and geopolitical risks outweigh forecasts for a firm dollar and a drop in physical demand in emerging markets.\n\nEven more bullish was a price survey of delegates at the London Bullion Market Association\u2019s conference in Shenzhen, who predict US$1,658 an ounce in a year from now, Bloomberg reported. The group, which represents the wholesale over-the-counter market, were only a few dollars off the current price when it forecast US$1,531 an ounce last year, the news agency said.\n\nTurning to producers, Canaccord Genuity expects many companies to double their earnings from second to third quarter when they start reporting later this month.\n\n\u201cWe expect a step change in earnings and cash flow generation for most producers in a US$1,500/oz gold price environment,\u201d Canaccord Genuity said. \u201cThis strong earnings growth should surpass any sector in the S&P 500 and could help attract investors into the gold space on strong earnings momentum.\u201d\n\nOn Newmont Goldcorp Corp., the world\u2019s largest gold miner, Canaccord Genuity issued a buy rating and increased its target price of the stock to US$60 from US$53 as the results period marks the first quarter of the combined Newmont and Goldcorp. The analyst also likes Barrick Gold for its joint venture with Newmont Goldcorp in Nevada and an improved production outlook. Canacord Genuity upgraded its rating on Barrick to buy from hold and increased its price target to $28 from $22.\n\nThe analyst kept its buy rating and increased its price target on Agnico Eagle to $98 from $87 as it raises production and trims costs. Likewise for Kinross Gold as it stays a buy and the price target rises to $9 from $8. The analyst also has buy ratings on Yamana Gold, Pan American Silver, Kirkland Lake Gold and B2Gold.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: cmcclelland@postmedia.com", "description": "Gold has room to increase in value, analysts say, making the metal and producers' stocks a good bet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gold.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
