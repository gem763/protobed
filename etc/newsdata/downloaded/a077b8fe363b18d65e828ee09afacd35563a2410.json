Check out Fall's scoring and rebounding averages per 36 minutes, per our @NBCSCeltics Twitter account:\n\nCheck out this amazing stat \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\udcc8 pic.twitter.com/EYrEeMN5zJ \u2014 Celtics on NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSCeltics) October 27, 2019\n\nYes, that's 48 points and 36 rebounds per 36 minutes. And if you remove sample size qualifiers, that's second in the NBA, ahead of the likes of Karl-Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Trae Young.\n\nThat got us wondering: What other crazy Tacko stats could we dig up if we ignore sample size? Quite a lot, it turns out.\n\nFrom NBA.com's advanced stats page, as of Saturday night:\n\nUSAGE RATE\n\n1. Tacko Fall -- 62.5%\n\n2. Kawhi Leonard -- 39.3%\n\n\n\nPOINTS PER 100 POSSESSIONS\n\n1. Trae Young -- 50.7\n\nT-2. Tacko Fall -- 50.0\n\nT-2. Karl-Anthony Towns -- 50.0\n\n4. Kyrie Irving -- 49.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOINTS PER 100 PLAYS\n\n1. Tacko Fall -- 50.0\n\n2. Trae Young -- 46.4\n\n3. Kyrie Irving -- 43.9\n\n\n\n\n\nPOINTS PER 48 MINUTES\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Elie Okobo -- 72.6\n\nT-2. Tacko Fall -- 52.8\n\n3. Karl-Anthony Towns -- 52.8\n\n4. Kyrie Irving -- 52.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere you have it, folks. Tacko Fall gets more touches than Kawhi Leonard and is a more efficient scorer than Karl-Anthony Towns and Kyrie Irving.\n\nThis is all tongue-in-cheek, obviously. Fall likely will be heading up to Maine to join the Red Claws once Daniel Theis and Enes Kanter return from injury, and he still has plenty of development ahead of him.\n\nBut for one night, at least, we can put the 7-foot-6 big man in the same sentence of NBA superstars.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
