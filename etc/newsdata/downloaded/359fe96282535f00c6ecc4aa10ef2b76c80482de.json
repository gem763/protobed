President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\"\n\nMs Pelosi dismissed the letter as \"manifestly wrong\".\n\nA self-inflicted wound\n\nAnalysis by Jonathan Turley, legal scholar\n\nThe letter rightfully raises concerns over the lack of a House vote and the secrecy of proceedings. The Democrats have limited Republicans in their effort to question witnesses and secure material. However, that is not a legitimate basis for refusing to co-operate or supply clearly material evidence.\n\nThe letter emphasises a lack of due process in the proceedings. Yet the constitution does not expressly require anything other than a vote of the House on impeachment itself and a majority threshold for any referral of the matter to the Senate for trial.\n\nThis is a constitutional function of the highest order for Congress. There is a legitimate basis for congressional investigation under both its oversight and impeachment authority. If proven, these allegations of self-dealing could be a basis for articles of impeachment. A president cannot simply pick up his marbles and leave the game because he does not like the other players. A refusal to co-operate with a constitutionally mandated process can itself be an abuse of power.\n\nThe letter is another avoidable self-inflicted wound by a White House that seems intent on counter-punching itself into an impeachment. There are defences here as well as viable privilege arguments. This letter however is eviscerating those defences with a reckless abandon.\n\nJonathan is professor of constitutional law at George Washington University", "description": "The former vice-president makes his strongest remarks since the impeachment inquiry began.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qlnzr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
