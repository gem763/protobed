Impeaching Donald Trump, especially on a party-line vote, may be dumb, reckless, blindly partisan or downright suicidal. But it is not a coup, even of the bloodless variety.\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MEN NOW BEING DRAGGED INTO THE IMPEACHMENT DRAMA\n\nThe president isn\u2019t the only one using intemperate language. Maxine Waters, the left-wing Democratic congresswoman, responded to his \u201cfilthy talk\u201d by declaring, \u201cImpeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement.\u201d\n\nSo much for due process or the formality of a trial. Waters is already picking out his jail cell.\n\nI had barely finished writing these words when the president tweeted about the \u201cDo Nothing Democrats,\u201d saying they are \u201cwasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on [BS.\u201d] Except he spelled it out.\n\nLook, it\u2019s hardly surprising that rhetoric is getting way overheated with the Democrats wielding a weapon that\u2019s only been used against Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. But words matter, in political discourse as in life. And \u201ccoup\u201d was no accident.\n\nTrump obviously has every incentive to rouse his supporters by painting himself as the victim of dark forces, including the media and the Deep State.\n\nAnd the critics can retire to their fainting couches when he retweets a phrase like \u201ccivil war.\u201d Journalists use the term all the time, talking about a Republican civil war or Democratic civil war or some other war.\n\nBut coup is different, and so is calling for a congressman\u2019s arrest. Trump yesterday called Adam Schiff a \u201clowlife\u201d who should resign, saying he couldn\u2019t carry Mike Pompeo\u2019s \u201cblank-strap.\u201d (Suddenly jock is a dirty word?) He\u2019s also ended a tweet about the House Intel chairman with: \u201cArrest for Treason?\u201d (The supposed treason is that Schiff exaggerated Trump\u2019s comments on the Ukraine call in what he said was a parody.)\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nKamala Harris, trying to break into the news, is demanding that Twitter suspend the president\u2019s account. There is zero chance of that happening, as the senator well knows. Can you imagine the backlash against the company, already accused of leaning left, for banning a commander-in-chief with 63 million followers?\n\nHarris pointed to Trump\u2019s postings in which he likened the intelligence whistle-blower to a spy and mentioned the word treason. \u201cThese tweets represent a clear intent to baselessly discredit the whistleblower and officials in our government who are following the proper channels to report allegations of presidential impropriety,\u201d she wrote Twitter chief Jack Dorsey.\n\nAs for the fourth estate, the president told reporters he is largely dropping \u201cfake\u201d and will refer to them as the \u201ccorrupt media.\u201d\n\nTrump was teeing off on the Washington Post, but he was mistaken; the focus of his ire was a new book by two New York Times reporters, Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.\n\nThe Times story based on the book said that in private meetings Trump \u201coften talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him.\u201d\n\nTrump ridiculed the story as a lie and said it was \u201cstupid\u201d to ask whether he\u2019d ever said such things. (Davis tweeted that the White House did not deny the account when twice presented with the details.)\n\nThe president then declared that he would largely retire his \u201cfake news\u201d formulation in favor of \u201ccorrupt news\u201d\u2014which, he added for good measure, is \u201ctruly the enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the latest sign of Trump\u2019s frustration, after years of negative coverage, in the midst of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker. When Fox\u2019s John Roberts asked Trump about a just posted New York Times story that the whistle-blower told Schiff\u2019s staff about his complaint days before filing it, he said he couldn\u2019t believe the paper had written it and that maybe it\u2019s getting better. When the president views a story as more favorable, he miraculously upgrades his opinion of the press.", "description": "President Trump just went there.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/02/694940094001_6091420520001_6091414510001-vs.jpg"}
