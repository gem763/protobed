Is he hell-bent on keeping this story alive\u2014in short, he insists that he was right when he claimed Hurricane Dorian was headed for Alabama, even after virtually all forecasters disputed this\u2014because he can\u2019t stand being wrong? Has he in fact lost whatever slender thread of sense he may have once possessed? Or is it all part of a diabolical plot to distract us from the fact that on Wednesday the Pentagon announced that the administration was diverting 3.6 billion from military construction projects to build the Trump border wall in a hurry\u2014in other words, by the 2020 election?\n\nWhatever the reason, this sorry state of affairs reached its nadir on Wednesday, when the president proffered a doctored weather map with a suspicious black line added that grazed Alabama. Asked by a reporter how that clearly fake addition got there, Trump professed total ignorance. But in fact he did know\u2014as was subsequently reported, the culprit was likely none other than the Sharpie-loving president himself. \"No one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie,\" a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the Washington Post.\n\nAs thousands were reported missing and feared dead in the Bahamas, as the Carolinas were under siege from Dorian, the president was still hammering away at this ludicrous matter. On Friday evening, he was back in I\u2019m-rubber-you\u2019re-glue territory, tweeting, \u201cFAKE NEWS. I would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story, but the LameStream Media just won\u2019t let it alone. They always have to have the last word, even though they know they are defrauding & deceiving the public.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, there was a far more important development than a Sharpie-defaced weather map: The president announced, again via Twitter, that he had canceled a previously undisclosed summit at Camp David with Taliban leaders, after the Taliban took responsibility for an attack last week that killed a U.S. soldier. (Let\u2019s face it\u2014the commander-in-chief is just no good at keeping secrets, whether it\u2019s a classified photo of an Iranian missile site or a hush-hush meeting with terrorists.)\n\nIn other news, guess where VP Mike Pence stayed on his recent jaunt to Ireland? Was it a) somewhere in the vicinity of Dublin, where he was meant to do some government business or was it b) 181 miles away at the Trump National resort in Doonbeg? We think you know the answer. At first, it was reported that Pence\u2019s family is from Doonbeg, and when he heard that, the president said, \"Stay at my place!\" But then, as in so many other cases, there was an immediate dial-back. According to CNN: \u201cA spokesperson for the vice president later said in a statement that the decision to stay at the property was \u2018solely\u2018 a decision by the vice president's office and \u2019at no time did the President direct our office to stay at his Doonbeg resort.\u2019\"\n\nAnd Moscow Mitch McConnell has a new nickname! The senate majority leader is now also known as Muzzle Mitch, since he is apparently in favor of free speech only when his own name isn\u2019t involved. On Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show last week, he whined that calling him Moscow Mitch is \u201cmodern-day McCarthyism. \u2026You know, I can laugh about things like the Grim Reaper, but calling me Moscow Mitch is over the top.\u201d\n\nLastly, on Wednesday the Department of Health and Human Services released its report on the mental health problems suffered by children separated from their parents at the border. As CBS News reported, \u201cAccording to program directors and mental health clinicians, separated children exhibited more fear, feelings of abandonment, and post-traumatic stress than did children who were not separated\u2026 some children would exhibit acute symptoms of grief, like crying inconsolably. These children also expressed physical symptoms of the mental trauma, including one child who reported that \u2018every heartbeat hurts.\u2019\"\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "Highlights from the news in Washington this week.", "authors": ["Lynn Yaeger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gKSPCMMl1h6WY3zpp93GAA--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTUwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/4667405319ce70bff8d26d1a050c2a67", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
