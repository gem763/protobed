A steady trickle of new endorsements for action followed, and a majority of the House\u2019s 235 Democrats now backs an impeachment inquiry.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSenior Democrats, however, are sending mixed messages on the prospect of trying to oust Trump.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler stunned many with his recent declaration that the House had already launched \u201cformal impeachment proceedings.\u201d The New York Democrat followed up with a series of court filings demanding expedited access to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s evidence and witnesses in order to further his committee's \u201cimpeachment investigation.\u201d\n\nYet Speaker Nancy Pelosi has continued to resist that posture, telling colleagues in a caucuswide call late last month, \u201cThe public isn\u2019t there on impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe technical status of the House drive toward impeachment may hinge on whether the courts agree with Nadler's interpretation, and September is packed with opportunities for the federal judiciary to weigh in. But the bottom line is that Pelosi will have the ultimate say.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/598/1155968404_6063701360001_6063699303001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nIn the meantime, Washington is stuck in an impeachment muddle \u2014 with Democrats straddling an ambiguous line between impeachment proceedings and standard congressional investigations. It\u2019s a dynamic that will test the unity of a diverse Democratic caucus this fall, and shape the party's battle to hold on to the House and defeat Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cI don't think the public is really ... clear about what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) on the state of play. \u201cWhether that\u2019s an intentional strategy or not, I don\u2019t know. But I think that\u2019s clearly the case.\u201d\n\nYarmuth \u2014 who has long been in favor of impeaching Trump \u2014 said he expects top Democrats, led by Nadler, to make it much clearer in September that the House is indeed moving ahead with the impeachment process.\n\n\u201cI would bet that before mid-October, there will be actual articles of impeachment drafted by the committee. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much doubt about that,\u201d Yarmuth said in an interview this week. \u201cI think Jerry\u2019s committed to doing that, and I think, a significant majority of the committee is there.\u201d\n\nRep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who also supports impeachment, added that he expects Nadler and other Judiciary members to begin drafting articles of impeachment soon after returning from recess. Exactly how soon, he said, is unclear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be people \u2014 the Al Green group writ large \u2014 who want the articles of impeachment by Sept. 15,\u201d Beyer said, referring to the Texas Democrat who has previously forced votes on impeachment.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the upcoming court battles, Democrats will have to decide soon whether they want to force the matter. Many pro-impeachment Democrats say they need to make substantial strides by the end of the year, before the 2020 presidential campaign begins in earnest.\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\nThe unsettled state of the impeachment question was reflected in the statements of lawmakers who declared support for impeachment proceedings throughout the August recess. Some called for an impeachment inquiry outright. Others simply declared support for the Judiciary Committee\u2019s \u201congoing\u201d impeachment efforts.\n\nBeyer said he can\u2019t pinpoint a precise moment when Democrats suddenly found themselves engaged in impeachment proceedings. Instead, he described it as a natural shift in the course of Democrats\u2019 investigations.\n\n\u201cJerry [Nadler] said all the way along that he\u2019s been trying to assemble all the pieces and I don\u2019t know what was the trigger to say, \u2018OK, enough pieces are together that it is now formally an inquiry.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a distinction with potentially massive implications: If the House is already in a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats\u2019 demands for information that could be damaging to Trump carry greater weight in court \u2014 where the growing list of oversight skirmishes between the House and the Trump administration will be determined.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who sits on the House Oversight Committee, acknowledged that the Democratic caucus\u2019 drift toward formal impeachment proceedings has been unclear \u2014 partly because it\u2019s been happening largely in the courts.\n\n\u201cI get that there is ambiguity on it,\u201d Khanna told reporters last week, adding that he, too, expected Nadler to take on the question more directly when members return.\n\n\u201cMy understanding of what he presented is that we are in an inquiry,\u201d Khanna said of Nadler. \u201cI think he has to clarify that.\u201d\n\nPrivately, some Democrats have speculated that the disjointed messaging could be intentional \u2014 or, at least, might offer an upside as the caucus remains split on the issue.\n\nIn some ways, Nadler\u2019s slow, calculated moves toward impeachment have helped appease a restive liberal base without generating the national furor that Pelosi and her deputies have sought to avoid.\n\nBut some lawmakers came face to face during the recess with fuming constituents who have followed every wrinkle of the fight.\n\n\u201cAn inquiry is underway before the courts,\u201d one middle-aged woman stood up during a recent town hall hosted by vulnerable Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. \u201cWhat I'm asking you is whether you will join with your ... colleagues and support an impeachment inquiry, one that is already going on.\u201d\n\nAt least 137 House Democrats are now on record saying they would vote to open an impeachment inquiry with more likely to trickle out this month.\n\nOn Sept. 13, the Justice Department will issue its first response to the Judiciary Committee\u2019s petition to access Mueller\u2019s most closely held evidence \u2014 documents and testimony he collected in front of a grand jury. That case, being weighed by the chief judge of Washington D.C.\u2019s federal district court, is the first in which Democrats argued they had in fact already launched an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d into Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.
