However, this year, markets have been buffeted by lower interest rates as macroeconomic conditions have worsened.\n\nBank of America is the most vulnerable among the big U.S. banks to fluctuations in interest rates because of its large deposit stock and rate-sensitive mortgage securities. The Federal Reserve has already cut rates twice this quarter.\n\nBofA took a small hit on its spread and reported a 4 basis-point decrease in its interest margin to 2.41% for the third quarter. But a 5% growth in overall loans helped it overcome the impact of lower rates.\n\nAlong with that, strong performance in investment banking and equities trading boosted total revenue past Wall Street expectations.\n\nRevenue from investment banking fees jumped 40%, while revenue from consumer banking - its biggest business - rose 3% to $9.7 billion.\n\nThe bank's equity trading business outperformed its peers with a 13% jump.\n\nThe bank's net interest income also came in higher at $12.34 billion, accounting for more than half of its total revenue.\n\nNet income applicable to common shareholders fell 21% to $5.27 billion, or 56 cents per share, hit by a $2 billion impairment charge. Excluding the charge, the bank earned 75 cents per share.\n\nRevenue, net of interest expense, rose slightly to $22.96 billion.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a profit of 51 cents per share and revenue of $22.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.", "description": "Advisory fees, lending power Bank of America beat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F11Z_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
