He pointed to the variety of areas where campaigns might want to invest money: airing television ads, deploying staff on the ground, staging splashy but expensive events and running a robust digital program.\n\n\u201cYour strategic options are limited,\u201d Mr. Devine said, adding that the options available to Mr. Biden\u2019s better-funded rivals were \u201cmuch bigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to place the right bet,\u201d Mr. Devine said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be a winner. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re playing roulette, and one guy gets five numbers and the other guy gets one number. Who\u2019s going to win?\u201d\n\nOver the summer, Mr. Biden had already begun to slash his digital spending budget, which was also clear in the new fillings. He spent about $1 million in the first half of the quarter and about $311,000 in the second half, records show.\n\nDuring the quarter, Mr. Biden also spent $924,000 on a charter jet company, Advanced Aviation Team, as he raced across the country not only for rallies and speeches but also for dozens of fund-raisers on both coasts. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign said the costs included paying for carbon offsets.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s biggest expense is his payroll, which cost about $6.8 million in the past three months, records show. Mr. Biden had roughly 440 people on staff \u2014 about as many as Mr. Buttigieg. Ms. Warren had the largest staff with more than 600. Mr. Sanders was second with about 550 people on the payroll.", "description": "In the past three months, Mr. Biden spent more on his campaign than he raised. He begins an aggressive phase of the primary race with far less cash on hand than top rivals.", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher", "Thomas Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/us/politics/16campfin/16campfin-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
