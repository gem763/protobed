They found that particulate matter air pollution fell 24% in the U.S. from 2009 to 2016, but it increased 5.5% the following two years.\n\n\"That increase was associated with 9,700 premature deaths in 2018,\" wrote Karen Clay and Nicholas Muller in a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nBehind the rise in air pollution\n\nThe researchers say three factors could explain the increase in air pollution: stronger economic growth in recent years, an increase in wildfires and weakened federal \"clean air\" rules.\n\nThe pickup in economic activity over the last few years \u2014 while a plus for workers and businesses \u2014 has resulted in more trucks and other polluting-emitting vehicles on the roads, as well as boosted manufacturers' carbon emissions, Clay and Muller noted.\n\n\"The chemical composition of particulates point to increased use of natural gas and to vehicle miles traveled as likely contributors to the increase\" in pollution, the economists wrote. \"We conclude that the effect is due to diesel vehicles as well as some industrial boilers.\"\n\nThe findings could bolster theories advanced by experts such as Oxford University economist Kate Raworth who argue that unrestrained economic growth is contributing to climate change.\n\nClay and Muller also linked increased airborne carbon particles partly to an increase in wildfires in the West since 2016.\n\n\"Because of these large increases and the large exposed population in California, we find that nearly 43% of the increase in deaths nationally from 2016 to 2018 occurred in California,\" they said.\n\nHow wildfire smoke and poor air quality can affect your health\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wildfires release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other ozone precursors into the atmosphere, along with toxic pollutants that can harm people living both nearby and far away.\n\nThe researchers also point to a decline in EPA enforcement of the Clean Air Act as a factor that could explain worsening air quality. The law, established in 1970, is responsible for preventing hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and hundreds of millions of cases of respiratory and heart disease, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group.", "description": "A decline in the nation's air quality since 2016 is linked to nearly 10,000 deaths, Carnegie Mellon researchers say", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/04/27/256d01dc-a645-11e2-a3f0-029118418759/thumbnail/1200x630/46f67874e3fdcece31a048902b23e968/smoke_emmisions_iStock_0000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
