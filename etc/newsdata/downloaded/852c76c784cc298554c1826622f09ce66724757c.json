French President Emmanuel Macron was among those pushing hardest for Trump and Rouhani to meet, but both leaders shut down the proposal prior to heading to New York.\n\nTensions between Tehran and Washington have risen dramatically over the last year, with Iran lashing out in response to Trump's decision to withdraw from a 2015 nuclear deal and leaving many fearing a potential military conflict in the region. Trump showed an openness to meeting with Rouhani, first declaring that he would require no preconditions for such talks but later walking that proclamation back.\n\nIn the most recent provocation, the U.S. and other allies blamed Iran for a series of drone attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure that harmed the global oil leader's production. Trump has declined to take any military action thus far, instead hitting Tehran with a fresh round of sanctions targeting its central bank.\n\nReuters quoted Rouhani, citing his official website, telling reporters after returning to Iran from the United Nations General Assembly this week that \u201cit was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they (the United States) had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions\u201d in order to secure a meeting between the two leaders.\n\n\u201cThey had sent messages to almost all European and no-European leaders that they wanted one-to-one negotiations between the two Presidents, but we had rejected it,\u201d Rouhani claimed, saying that he\u2019d asked for negotiations to include the six members of the U.N. Security Council, claiming \u201cthey accepted.\u201d\n\nBut, he\u2019d argued, \u201cthe problem here is that under sanctions and maximum pressure, even if we want to negotiate with the Americans within the framework of P5+1, nobody can predict about the end and upshot of the negotiation.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/97/b7/3cd585fe4e7aba9c9e466f2655ac/190927-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
