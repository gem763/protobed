At the time of writing, the talks were still ongoing.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.K. government bond surged 10 basis points in response to 0.69%, its highest in over three weeks.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. bond yields were also rising in expectation of some kind of de-escalation of the trade dispute with China, helped by President Donald Trump's talk on Twitter about \"good things happening\".\n\nThe note yield leaped to 1.72%, its highest in over two weeks, while the , which is more sensitive to short-term interest rate expectations, rose to a 10-day high of 1.59%.\n\nHigher yields make bonds more attractive to gold, which offers no nominal return.\n\nWith portfolio holdings of gold close to all-time highs, the metal is vulnerable to pull-backs, at least in the short term, analysts say.\n\nHowever, Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity research at BNP Paribas (PA: ), argued in a blog post for the World Gold Council this week that bulls can still look forward to three more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, taking the fed funds rate down to 1.25% by June next year.\n\nElsewhere, there were signs of how volatility in gold prices this year has caused some unexpected problems in the Far East, where much of the world\u2019s physical gold demand is based.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Bank of Thailand Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob urged the country\u2019s gold traders to keep the proceeds of their gold sales overseas for longer, because the repatriafion of profits was putting too much upward pressure on the local currency.\n\n\u201cThere were quite huge gold flows, which added to appreciation pressure on the baht,\u201d Veerathai said.\n\nGold dealers said exports had spiked because Thais who bought gold in the past were taking advantage of a recent rise in global prices to cash out.\n\nDespite the recent outflows, Thailand has still imported a net $43.6 billion of gold since 2009 - although that includes imports for use in jewellery and religious items in the largely Buddhist country as well as by gold traders.", "description": "Gold Prices Fall as Trade, Brexit Hopes Hit Haven Assets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1H0CO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
