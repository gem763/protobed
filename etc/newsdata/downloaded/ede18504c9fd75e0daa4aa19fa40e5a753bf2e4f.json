That\u2019s a more obvious unintended consequence, but there may be others, so you will need to think it through with those who administer the system \u2013 in your case HR and people managers.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of unintended consequences, from the implementation of a profanity filter by AOL in 1996 that ended up blocking residents of Scunthorpe, to the cane toads introduced in Queensland that can now be found down our coastline.\n\nGood intentions do not always make for a strong defence. When the tech industry recently cited unintended consequences, it was accused of using \u201cthe usual weak excuse for bad policies\u201d. You could take this as a warning for you to do your homework on the systems over which you reside, especially now that you\u2019re the boss.\n\nI worked with a person once who really did me over \u2013 they lied and were deceptive in cunning ways. Now our work paths are set to cross again. Many years may have passed and I\u2019m now a senior leader (more senior than they are) but the memories are still there. Am I a bad person (or even unethical) because I can\u2019t forgive and forget?\n\nSome consider it a maxim to forgive and forget. It\u2019s not just about \u201cmoving on\u201d, it\u2019s often seen as the higher moral position. We need only think of Nelson Mandela\u2019s ability to forgive. He held that \u201cforgiveness liberates the soul\u201d.\n\nPsychologists have confirmed that forgiving can be good for our emotional health. However, we\u2019re not all capable of such noble acts, even for far lesser wrongdoings. Some have taken to distinguishing between forgiving and forgetting, focusing on the former.\n\nPop star Taylor Swift was referred to as a \u201cPhilosopher of Forgiveness\u201d when she offered her insights after having been wronged. \u201cPeople go on and on about you have to forgive and forget to move past something,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You just become indifferent and then you move on.\u201d\n\nSome philosophers hold that there are valid reasons not to forgive and forget. Wrongdoings by people such as your former colleague can send a demeaning message that shouldn\u2019t necessarily go unchallenged. Philosopher Dr Scott Hershovitz goes so far as to encourage people to resent. He cites another philosopher, Professor Pamela Hieronymi, who claims that when you resent, you protest the message, you insist, if only to yourself, that you do matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a practical sense, the question is, can you work together? It might be an idea to get together beforehand and have an honest discussion to see if there\u2019s an explanation for what happened and a commitment for things to be different this time \u2013 not lest you get bitten twice. If you\u2019re not satisfied with what you hear then you could consider yourself obliged to speak to your colleagues.\n\nIf they are determined to bring the person on despite your experience, then you could heed the words of Oscar Wilde, who encouraged forgiveness for an entirely different reason, \u201cAlways forgive your enemies, nothing annoys them so much\u201d.\n\nDo you have an ethical dilemma at work?
