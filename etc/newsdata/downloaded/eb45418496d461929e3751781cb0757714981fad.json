It\u2019s not just in Paris but it is all over the world.\u201d", "description": "Busan (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Ladj Ly, the director of France\u2019s Oscar hope \u201cLes Miserables\u201d, said Monday he backed Hong Kong\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/45ce23_ladj-ly-france-oscar-hope-les-miserables-he-can-support-hong-kong-pro-democracy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
