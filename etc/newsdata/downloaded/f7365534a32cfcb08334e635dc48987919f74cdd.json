But after weeks of negotiations, British and EU leaders welcomed an agreement being struck.\n\n\u201cWhere there is a will, there is a deal - we have one!\u201d said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as the news broke from Brussels.\n\nSterling, the key gauge of Brexit sentiment, jumped as much as a 1% against the dollar, putting it on course for its best six-day gain in more than 30 years before the doubts and grumbles set in.\n\nBut market optimism faltered when the Northern Ireland party said it could not support the agreement.\n\nHaving run up as far as $1.2988 GBP=, sterling fell well under $1.28 before regaining momentum to trade at $1.2863, up 0.26% on the day.\n\nEuropean shares edged lower, even as fading optimism over the Brexit deal was offset by strong earnings from Sweden\u2019s Ericsson.\n\nMSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.34%.\n\nFrance's CAC 40 index .FCHI eased 0.4% after hitting a fresh 12-year high earlier, while Germany's DAX .GDAXI closed down 0.1%, though near its strongest level in over a year.\n\nShares in domestically focused British companies and Irish firms, which have been seen as a barometer on Brexit sentiment, also gave up initial gains.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nLondon's benchmark FTSE .FTSE index closed up 0.2% and the broad-market pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.1%, while the FTSEurofirst index .FTEU3 of leading regional European shares slid 0.12%.\n\nUK Gilts GB10YT=RR, German Bunds DE10YT=RR, gold and most other safe havens also rebounded after selling off.\n\nOn Wall Street, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shares rose 2.47% in heavy trade after the video streaming service provider added slightly more paying subscribers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS.N) gained 1.52% after the big lender beat analysts\u2019 expectations for quarterly profit, buoyed by higher revenue from bond trading and M&A advisory fees.\n\nEarnings season is dictating U.S. market moves, which has historically been the case, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.\n\n\u201cThe buck stops with earnings,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cThe good news is most earnings reports thus far have been positive and that\u2019s provided some nice momentum for the market.\u201d\n\nOnce the third-quarter earnings season winds down macro factors are likely to play a bigger role, such as the U.S.-China trade talks, and price swings will pick up, she said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 23.9 points, or 0.09%, to 27,025.88. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.26 points, or 0.28%, to 2,997.95 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 32.67 points, or 0.4%, to 8,156.85.\n\nEmerging-market stocks .MSCIEF also gained for a sixth day - their longest winning streak since early April - after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators were nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.39%, with the euro EUR= up 0.49% to $1.1124. The Japanese yen JPY= strengthened 0.12% versus the greenback at 108.66 per dollar.\n\nOil prices rebounded after draw-downs in U.S. fuel inventories, but the gains were capped by a larger-than-expected rise in crude stockpiles and a series of weak economic figures.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures settled up 49 cents at $59.91 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 rose 57 cents to settle at $53.93.\n\nFILE PHOTO: British five pound banknotes are seen in this picture illustration taken November 14, 2017.
