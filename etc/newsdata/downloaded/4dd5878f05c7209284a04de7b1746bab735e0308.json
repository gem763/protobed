To celebrate the \u201cextra hour,\u201d we\u2019re dedicating this week to work and productivity. Welcome to Work Week. Photo: Courtesy Atlas Supply Co.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking for adult backpacks at the Strategist. That time has led us to find the best travel backpacks, laptop backpacks, and even backpacks with wheels. But the world of practical-yet-stylish work backpacks is a different beast, because anyone who\u2019s looked knows it can be hard to find an actually stylish backpack that holds everything you need to make it through a day at the office (from your laptop to your packed lunch) yet still look nice enough to bring to dinner once you\u2019re off the clock. The best work backpacks also look professional, with the same swagger as a briefcase, but are as practical as the backpack you brought to elementary school, even when stuffed to the brim. To find the best backpacks for work that actually look good, we talked to stylish professionals about the bags they rely on, Monday to Friday. Read on for their picks.\n\nDagne Dover Dakota Backpack in Onyx, Medium This Dagne and Dover backpack was recommended by two of the people we spoke with, both of whom highlighted the durable neoprene construction, ample storage space, and clean, minimalist look. \u201cThe scuba material is weather-resistant for city life, easy to clean, and very adorable,\u201d says Emily Griesing, the chief strategy officer at Bossible, who opted for the \u201cdark moss\u201d color (it also comes in unique shades of blue, tan, purple, and more). She adds, \u201cit fits gym clothes, lunch and a laptop \u2014 all the daily essentials. I actually had been eyeing the backpack online, and then finally saw it in person when a friend had one. When I felt the material, I went and bought it immediately, and I get compliments on it all the time.\u201d Personal stylist Cassandra Sethi is also a fan, and says that since the backpack is made of neoprene and mesh, \u201cit molds to your body and breathes.\u201d Sethi adds that while it can comfortably \u201chold everything you need\u201d for the workday, it\u2019s also great for travel. She says \u201cit was the perfect backpack to bring along\u201d on her four-country honeymoon trip last year. $175 at Dagne Dover Buy\n\nHaerfest Travel Backpack, Small Nylon Haerfest\u2019s Travel Backpack, which is made of nylon with rubberized trim, was also endorsed by multiple professionals. \u201cI really stand behind my Haerfest backpack,\u201d says Guillaume Viau, DJ and part of electronic music duo Flight School. \u201cI\u2019ve been using this one style for over a year now, traveling all over the world, and it\u2019s still in great shape. They really did find the perfect balance between functional and stylish.\u201d Haerfest also makes this same backpack in a cotton twill fabric with leather trim, which Abby Forman, senior manager of communications at Fiverr, tells us \u201ctwo of my male colleagues have and love. It\u2019s small enough for them to carry on their backs as they ride their bikes (one rides his bike to work from Williamsburg), but also large enough to fit some extras besides just their laptops.\u201d $265 at Haerfest Buy\n\nHaerfest Travel Backpack, Large Nylon Forman herself uses the larger version of Harfest\u2019s nylon Travel Backpack, because she prefers something with a little more space. \u201cI think women tend to carry more than men, so this is perfect for me. A bit larger, I can fit my laptop, jacket, makeup bag, etc.\u201d She has it in gray, which is currently sold out, but it\u2019s available in this nice blue color. $265 at Haerfest Buy\n\nBaggu Large Sport Backpack Jules Bakshi, the founder of Brooklyn-based dance and \u201cmindful fitness\u201d studio Good Move, told us she is almost always carrying a fanny pack/shoulder bag from Baggu, a brand beloved by many a Strategist staffer. But sometimes she needs something bigger, and when she does she pulls out this Baggu backpack. \u201cIf I need to carry my laptop or extra shoes and clothes, or I\u2019m leaving the city for some fresh air, I\u2019ll take the large Baggu sport backpack. It\u2019s comfortable and has plenty of room for a change of clothes and shoes, a picnic blanket, water bottles, snacks, etc. Plus there are two big pockets in the front, and a cushioned laptop sleeve.\u201d $84 at Baggu Buy\n\nBaggu Drawstring Backpack For a less expensive but just as practical work backpack from Baggu, consider this drawstring backpack, which is made of canvas, available in a rainbow of colors (including lilac, nautical blue and white stripes, and, of course, black), and comes recommended by former Strategist writer Lauren Levy. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a more casual canvas, but the thinner straps make it seem less \u2018I\u2019m coming from class\u2019 backpack-y and more \u2018I have a job during the day, but this is good for my back and also convenient\u2019 backpack,\u201d she says. $44 at Baggu Buy\n\nBaboon Backpack, Emerald Green, 22-Liters Daniel DuGoff, a menswear designer and founder of the swimwear-focused line Homoco, likes Baboon\u2019s 22-liter backpack for everyday use. His preferred color is emerald green, but it comes in a variety of options like black and dark blue if the green is too wild for your workplace. The backpack is made of durable cordura nylon, has a built-in padded laptop sleeve, and is backed by the company\u2019s lifetime warranty. $89 at BABOON Buy\n\nBartaile C12 Black Leather Backpack Laura Medalia, the New York City\u2013based software engineer behind the Instagram account @codergirl_, calls this backpack from Bartaile (a women-founded startup that was born at Wharton) her favorite bag right now. \u201cIt\u2019s a sleek, thin, black leather backpack that can be converted into a tote or hand held bag. It matches with all outfits, and has a snug case for my laptop.\u201d $325 at Bartaile Buy\n\nAtlas Supply Co. Minimalist, Sand Atlas Supply\u2019s Minimalist leather backpack was recommended by two of the people we reached out to. Alexis Teichmiller, the host of the Laptop Lifestyle podcast and an affiliate manager for Convert Kit, says it\u2019s her go-to. \u201cI bought this bag because of how many compartments it has,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt can hold my laptop, books, camera, and so much more. I even named my bag Blanche, because I love giving everyday things a personality.\u201d Tim Melideo, a men\u2019s fashion writer at Stay Classic, is also a fan. He\u2019s had this backpack for two years and uses it for travel, road trips, meetings \u2014 \u201cbasically everything,\u201d he says. Melideo also has the very same backpack in a less expensive canvas-with-leather-trim model, which he loves as well. \u201cThe leather is probably the more professional-looking, but I guess it depends which profession, right?\u201d $297 at Atlas Supply Co. Buy\n\nMatt & Nat Vintage Fabi Mini If you\u2019re looking for vegan leather, content strategist and branding stylist Libby Bartley recommends her backpack from Matt & Nat. In our roundup of the best work bags for women, she explained she likes it not only because it is \u201cethically made and manufactured with sustainable resources,\u201d but also because \u201cthe bag features adjustable straps, expandable gussets, and pockets for laptops and smartphones. Not only is the bag multifunctional for work and play \u2014 it\u2019s a long-lasting investment.\u201d $145 at Matt & Nat Buy\n\nMakr Farm Rucksack \u201cI have a couple of bags that I switch between, but this is my go-to backpack,\u201d says Jennie De Witt, a Facebook Live vlogger and a travel writer at Townie Tourist. \u201cThis bag is a workhorse without a ton of bells and whistles,\u201d she says. It\u2019s made with premium materials like heavy duck canvas and Horween leather, which De Witt says sets it apart from other backpacks out there. \u201cThe canvas is structured so well that the bag is never bulky. And the sturdy comfortable straps and unique leather fasteners make it stylish enough to go from bike to presentation without looking like I am underdressed.\u201d She adds that \u201cthe best part about this backpack is that it is made in the USA, and hyper-locally\u201d in her home state of Florida. \u201cI love supporting makers from my own state,\u201d De Witt says. $225 at Makr Buy\n\nTumi Voyageur Carson Laptop Backpack Architect-turned-entrepeneur Lori Cheek, the founder of the dating app Cheekd, says people compliment her on this backpack \u201con an almost daily basis.\u201d She loves the look of the gold detailing, and relies on the expansive storage space because, as she puts it, \u201cmy office is literally in my backpack and I\u2019m always working \u2018on the go.\u2019\u201d One of Cheek\u2019s favorite features is the \u201cseparate zipped compartment\u201d that fits her 15-inch MacBook Pro \u201cperfectly,\u201d but she adds that it also \u201cfits everything else I need to successfully run my business and live out my bag from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., five days a week!\u201d $395 at Amazon Buy $395 at Amazon Buy\n\nEmprio Armani Black Backpack Publicist Jon Salas bought this pared down Armani backpack because he was looking for something that he could wear casually if he wanted, but that was also \u201celevated enough to fit in any buttoned-up situation\u201d as well. \u201cI can be going from the office to an event, to a client meeting, or to traveling on a moment\u2019s notice, so it\u2019s important to me to have a bag that is neutral and versatile.\u201d While it\u2019s on the more expensive end of the spectrum, Salas says \u201cthe price and quality are a good match,\u201d especially for a luxury brand like Armani. He adds that he\u2019s owned other bags made by the brand and \u201cthey are built to last.\u201d $325 at Giorgio Armani Buy\n\nWANT Les Essentiels Kastrup Leather Backpack Caleb Thill, a New York City\u2013based content creator, swears by his black leather backpack from Montreal-based brand Want Les Essentials, because it\u2019s \u201cdefinitely work and business-appropriate while having a bit of edge.\u201d While we aimed to keep everything on this under $500, we made an exception for this elegant and minimalist black leather backpack, as we think its sleek aesthetic makes it worth considering if you\u2019re willing to splurge. For a very similar look at a price that\u2019s just under $500, this same backpack comes in a canvas style with black leather trim. $695 at Bergdorf Goodman Buy\n\nChrome Industries Echo Bravo Backpack Jordan Sanchez, a barista at Blue Bottle Coffee in Tribeca, often bikes to work, so he needs something durable that\u2019s designed for commuting on two wheels. Chrome Industries is one of his favorite companies, and although he loves its classic Cargo backpack, he says the cleaner look of this Echo Bravo backpack might be a better fit in an office environment. The commuter backpack has criss-crossing buckles to make sure everything stays in place and secure. And between its padded laptop sleeve, tarp lining, and thick nylon outer material, Sanchez thinks that it will protect whatever you put inside it, even when biking in the rain. $120 at Chrome Industries Buy\n\nTimbuk2 Grid Backack Sanchez also has this roll-top backpack from Timbuk2, which he says is great for biking and commuting. In his opinion, roll-top style backpacks are a little \u201csleeker and more professional-looking.\u201d Strategist contributor David Pogue is also a big fan of Timbuk2, a brand that hyperenthusiastic Amazon reviewers say makes some of the best commuter backpacks and men\u2019s messenger bags. Pogue particularly likes what he calls the brand\u2019s \u201cawesome end-of-life system\u201d for recycling used bags. As he explains, \u201cBasically, you send the old bag back to the company, which cleans it up and donates it to someone in need, and you get 20 percent off your next bag.\u201d $159 at Timbuk2 Buy\n\nPatagonia Arbor Market Pack \u201cI have recently become a little obsessed with backpacks,\u201d says Alexa Harrison, public relations manager at travel company and guidebook publisher Atlas Obscura, who told us, \u201cI got tired of the totebag life and looking like a bag lady.\u201d She used to use a large 25-liter Fjallraven bag with a \u201cseparated compartment layout,\u201d but she found the design \u201cwasn\u2019t conducive to what I needed to carry: Lunch, water bottle, computer, workout clothes, and other personal effects.\u201d So Harrison switched to this Patagonia backpack, which she says is just right for her needs. \u201cI found that while this Patagonia bag has smaller volume, it is all open and a top loader so I can shove literally whatever I need to into it. The best part is that it feels like nothing is on my back no matter how stuffed it is. I don\u2019t know what the ergonomics are, but it\u2019s amazing.\u201d $79 at Patagonia Buy $79 at REI Buy\n\nL.L. Bean Mountain Classic Cordura Backpack Dustin Sposato, the communications manager at data-focused nonprofit Project Evident, says he was very happy with his Everlane backpack for a few years, but it eventually started to break down. When it did, he wanted to get something a little different \u2014 and ideally more durable, he told us. Sposato ultimately landed on this Cordura Backpack from L.L. Bean. \u201cI grew up in Maine and always had L.L. Bean backpacks as a kid, so it felt like a natural pick,\u201d says Sposato. \u201cThey\u2019re super functional and last forever \u2014 my mom still uses one I had in elementary school. This one felt \u2018adult\u2019 without being overly sleek.\u201d $89 at L.L. Bean Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
