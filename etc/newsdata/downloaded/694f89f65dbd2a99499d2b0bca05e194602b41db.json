Raised in Furzedown, near Tooting in south London, he joined a state school that did not have a rugby team or even include rugby on the curriculum.\n\nLast week Sinckler played a starring role in England\u2019s World Cup quarter-final victory over Australia, and the prop forward is expected to feature prominently in the semi-final against New Zealand on Saturday.\n\nAt 13, Sinckler and some of his friends approached a PE teacher, Anastacia Long, to ask if she would help them set up a club. \u201cI told them I\u2019d be happy to arrange some fixtures and drive the minibus,\u201d she said. Long\u2019s husband, a rugby coach, agreed to referee.\n\nFor the first few years, Graveney school had only one set of rugby kits, which were circulated between players across the school aged from 11 to 18. Lacking its own pitch, all matches were away games and training took place in local parks or at Old Rutlishians rugby club, which allowed them to play for free.\n\nKyle Sinckler with his Graveney teammates. Photograph: Handout\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to push it at all, their enthusiasm was quite infectious,\u201d Long said. \u201cI only pushed when I realised how much it was doing for the boys in terms of the discipline, confidence and respect. Having a meal with other teams after matches was really impacting the behaviour of the kids, and it provided a sort of physical relief.\u201d\n\nThe school began to encourage students who had been excluded to take up rugby, and many of the players in Long\u2019s squad went on to be the first in their families to attend university. \u201cA lot of those kids in exclusion had their lives turned around by rugby,\u201d she said.\n\nThe players\u2019 roots in the capital\u2019s state school education system was in some ways an advantage, offering a fresh and unpredictable style of play. \u201cThese were tough kids,\u201d Long said. \u201cWhen you put them on the field, they just play to their own strengths because they\u2019ve never been trained, and that\u2019s much harder for the other team to combat. You can teach people to play rugby but you can\u2019t teach speed, size, passion.\u201d\n\nBy the time Long left Graveney in 2017, the school had a rugby team at every age group and the under-15s had reached the final of the NatWest Cup. Some of its players had been picked up by the Premiership team Harlequins and offered scholarships to independent schools for sixth form. Kyle Sinckler was one.\n\nSinckler\u2019s family still live close to the school and his mother works at the local police call centre. Sinckler is often spotted in the area and is in regular contact with Long, texting her before matches and still calling her \u201cMiss\u201d.\n\nRichard Smith, the president of Ironsides rugby club, where the future England star first trained as a child, said Sinckler was \u201cidolised\u201d by the junior players.\n\nAn era-defining epic: England and All Blacks braced for semi-final battle | Robert Kitson Read more\n\n\u201cKyle always makes a point of making sure he\u2019s free for our fun days, and when he comes down there\u2019s about 300 kids getting their shirts signed. Rugby in the area has become a lot more popular, and a lot of that is to do with Kyle,\u201d he said.\n\nSmith also credited Sinckler with encouraging state school students to attend the club.\n\nIn a report commissioned after the London 2012 Olympics, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector found that 61% of Premiership players had attended private schools \u2013 10 times the proportion in the general population and the highest of any English sport.\n\nFor many young players, Sinckler continues to provide a source of inspiration, acting as a role model for those who do not typically see people from their background in rugby union.\n\n\u201cKyle was one of the only black kids playing, he\u2019d come from the same kind of school and a similar background,\u201d Long said. \u201cThat really resonated with the kids. They look for things like that.\u201d", "description": "Prop forward attended state school in London and is now a role model for others on similar path", "authors": ["Molly Blackall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d5590652f33929b1bd00c0edfd0674f35137b77/0_202_3892_2336/master/3892.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=07b7d188fc9834421e44fbcdf9630ab4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
