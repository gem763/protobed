The government has repeatedly said Britain will be ready for such an eventuality.\n\n\u201cThe impact of a no-deal Brexit would be to trigger a whole new phase of the most extraordinary uncertainty,\u201d Fairbairn said. \u201cWe\u2019d need to have tens or hundreds, if not thousands, of side deals to be able to cope with the impact of no-deal on borders, on Northern Ireland, on tariffs, on people. We\u2019d be mired in uncertainty for years to come.\u201d\n\nThe government says it wants a deal, but that the deadline for leaving must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThe problem that we have is that this has been an endless debate. The referendum took place three and a half years ago -- people have gone to university and graduated in that time,\u201d Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to end this without just reiterating the question.\u201d\n\nA group of opposition parties are working with former Conservative members of Parliament to stop a no-deal departure, and have passed legislation to force the premier to delay Brexit if he hasn\u2019t got a deal approved by Oct. 19.\n\nFairbairn said the CBI is \u201ctrying to stay completely out of the politics,\u201d but acknowledged \u201cyes, we do talk to them,\u201d when asked about the anti-no-deal coalition. \u201cBut we also talk to the government, we talk to the opposition, we talk to all parties.\u201d", "description": "U.K. Business Warns Against \u2018Normalizing\u2019 No-Deal Split From EU", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5336e6e0a482d9672f2fdc19b25f4033.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
