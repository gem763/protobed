(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Energy Secretary Rick Perry will leave his job by the end of the year, President Donald Trump said Thursday.\n\nPerry \"has done a fantastic job\" at Energy, \"but it was time\" for him to leave, Trump said.\n\nPerry, 69, a former Texas governor, has been energy secretary since March 2017, making him one of the longest-serving members of Trump's Cabinet, which has seen huge turnover.\n\nHe was traveling with Trump to Texas when he notified the president of his decision aboard Air Force One.\n\nTrump told reporters he \"knew six months ago\" that Perry wanted to leave by the end of the year. \"He's got some ideas for doing something else. He's a terrific guy,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said he already knows who will succeed Perry, but declined to identify the person.\n\nPerry's departure comes as he is under scrutiny over the role he played in the president's dealings with Ukraine, which are currently the subject of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nHouse Democrats have subpoenaed Perry for documents related to a Ukrainian state-owned energy company as well as his involvement in a July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The lawmakers set a Friday deadline.\n\nTrump has said Perry teed up the July 25 call, in which Trump pressed Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son, who was employed by a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nPerry did not answer questions about his decision upon arrival in Fort Worth.\n\nA spokeswoman for Perry could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nThe spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes, has said Perry wanted Trump to speak with the Ukrainian leader on energy matters related to U.S. efforts to boost Western energy ties to Eastern Europe. It is part of a long-term effort to lessen the political control Russia wields through its dominance of the fuel supply.\n\nThe Associated Press reported this month that a circle of businessmen and Republican donors touted their connections to Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as they sought to install new management at the top of Ukraine's state-owned gas company last spring.\n\nThe plan hit a snag after Zelinskiy's election, but Perry took up the effort to install a friendlier management team at the company, Naftogaz. Perry attended Zelinskiy's May 2019 inauguration as the administration's senior representative and met privately with Zelinskiy. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nPerry had disputed published reports that he was planning to leave the administration. He told a news conference in Lithuania earlier this month: \"One of these days they will probably get it right. But it's not today, it's not tomorrow, not next month. Keep saying it and one day you'll be right.\"\n\nPerry, who twice ran for president before taking the job at Energy, has kept a relatively low-profile in his 2 \u00bd-year tenure. He has supported Trump's call for \"energy dominance\" around the world and pushed to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants. He said last year that a rash of coal and nuclear retirements was \"alarming\" and posed a looming crisis for the nation's power grid.\n\n\"If unchecked, (the plant closures) will threaten our ability to recover from intentional attacks and natural disasters,\" Perry said at a speech in Texas.\n\nTrump, who has frequently promised to bring back coal jobs, directed Perry in June 2018 to take \"immediate steps\" to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, calling it a matter of national and economic security.\n\nNo definitive action has been taken since then. A regional transmission organization that oversees the power grid in 13 Eastern and Midwestern states said there's no immediate threat to system reliability.\n\nPerry has won plaudits from lawmakers for an easygoing style that reflects a life in politics, and he has frequently distanced himself from severe budget cuts to energy programs sought by the White House. He has toured Energy Department sites around the country, represented the Trump administration at meetings overseas and begun a years-long process to revive a shuttered nuclear waste dump at Nevada's Yucca Mountain.\n\nBefore taking the Energy job, Perry had been subjected to widespread ridicule after forgetting the name of an agency he pledged to eliminate as president. That agency was the Energy Department. Despite that, Perry has emerged as a strong defender of the department's work, especially the 17 national labs that conduct cutting-edge research on everything from national security to renewable energy.\n\n\"I'm telling you officially the coolest job I've ever had is being secretary of Energy ... and it's because of these labs,\" Perry told employees at the Idaho National Laboratory in 2017.\n\nTrump denied reports that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott or Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy could replace Perry, but said, \"They would both be very good.\"\n\n__\n\nColvin reported from Fort Worth, Texas.
