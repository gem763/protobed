yes.\n\nIn the 80s they were telling us to just say no.\n\nNah.\n\nI would always advise it\u2019s better to say yes to any opportunity.\n\nFollow your gut, not other people.\n\nThat\u2019s important in order to be independent in every aspect of your life.\n\nWhen I first found fame, Elton John\u2019s advice for me regarding the media was \u2018f**k them\u2019.\n\nI never managed to work out if he meant metaphorically or literally.\n\nSo I did both.\n\nMy proudest moment was playing at Glastonbury .\n\nI performed on the Pyramid Stage three times, and for me that\u2019s as cool as I\u2019m ever going to get.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of crowd surfing, so I leapt off the stage into an audience of 85,000 and felt so cool.\n\nOnly, once I\u2019d got back I realised that the stage was too high for me to climb onto.\n\nSo I started to panic and looked into the eyes of a stranger staring down at me from the side of the stage and desperately pleaded, \u2018Help me\u2019.\n\nI soon realised he was the BBC camera man and at that point I was the least cool man to ever exist.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nYour first experiences are always the most traumatic ones.\n\nAn early memory is me running over a snake on my bicycle and it getting caught in the wheel.\n\nIf I had known the word I\u2019d have been screaming \u2018f**k\u2019 repeatedly.\n\nI had my first car crash aged three, when I lived in Cyprus on a helicopter army patch.\n\nI got in the car one day and, as my mum walked away for a second, I fiddled with the gear stick.\n\nThe hand brake wasn\u2019t on and the car rolled towards the fence where there was a Turkish Cypriot minefield.\n\nI jumped out and started shouting, \u2018I\u2019m sorry!\u2019 I remember the wing mirrors flying off and my mum\u2019s washing line being dragged along with the car.\n\nChaos.\n\nI don\u2019t drive much now, to be honest, I\u2019m a motorbike man.\n\nI love bringing people together.\n\nThree of my band mates have married members of the audience.\n\nWe treat the audience as our mates and love meeting them.\n\nTo have created romance has been a grand, wealthy experience.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThere are so many things I\u2019d change about myself .\n\nThe premise I take towards plastic surgery is little and often.\n\nI\u2019m working on a few extensions here and there to be the person I truly want to be.\n\nSo in a few years I should be 5ft 10in, rather than the 5ft 8in I am now.\n\nMy biggest fear is running out of beer.\n\nBut that would never happen, because my tour manager is amazing.\n\nAt my holiday house in Ibiza I built a nightclub in the garden and I was sponsored by two vodka firms when we started out.\n\nOne gave me 500 bottles of vodka.\n\nIn the first summer I got through 50.\n\nI have nine years\u2019 worth left \u2013 lunacy!\n\nThen Ciroc Vodka sponsored me with 400 bottles.\n\nI have two decades of booze, so now I actually bathe in it.\n\nIf anyone needs a bath, come to me.\n\nThe last time I was really drunk was yesterday .\n\nI like to start the night with a beer.\n\nI have my own pub in Chelsea and we serve a lager called the Fox & Fez, which is really good.\n\nThen I have good red wine, then vodka and tonics.\n\nIf I make it to J\u00e4gerbombs I know I\u2019ve gone too far.\n\nBut as my father always said, \u2018Do it, just don\u2019t get caught.\u2019\n\n(Image: X80003)\n\nIt helps to be nocturnal in this job .\n\nI wish there was a pill that took sleeping out of the equation \u2013 it\u2019s a waste of time.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s not for me.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of life?\n\nIt is to spend time with the people you love, and I choose a lot of time away from them.\n\nIt can be a struggle.\n\nI don\u2019t look at myself in the mirror and think, \u2018Where did it all go wrong?\u2019\n\nBut I am on tour a lot and that comes at a cost.\n\nI have a wife and two children who are the loves of my life\u2026 but I am away for 18 months at a time, and I am just about to go on another tour for a year.\n\nWith that comes loneliness and isolation, not just for me, but for them too.\n\nI was in the army and went on operations, but one of the bravest things I do is stand on stage and sing my little heart out songs that mean a great deal to me about personal experiences .\n\nI\u2019m afraid to be judged and it\u2019s exposing.\n\nPeople stand shoulder to shoulder listening and that\u2019s why it\u2019s one of the most rewarding things I do.\n\nSecrets Behind My Snapshot\n\nI always joked that if I made it big in music I\u2019d live out in Ibiza in the summer \u2013 and now I\u2019m living that dream.\n\nHere I am actually in St Tropez at a party celebrating the town\u2019s legacy.\n\nIt was a finely dressed affair and everyone was put together beautifully.\n\nBut I\u2019d come straight from Ibiza, so was representing in my tank top, sweatbands and my trusty pink flamingo.\n\nVodka in hand in a wine glass, don\u2019t be fooled, I don\u2019t drink lady petrol.\n\nGrowing up in the Mediterranean as my dad was in the Army, I became accustomed to their lovely way of life.\n\nI adore Ibiza in particular and still hit up the clubs as much as I can, they\u2019re amazing.\n\nBut now I have kids it isn\u2019t as good to still be out at 4am, as I\u2019m not exactly engaged the next day.\n\nNow there\u2019s a club that opens at 6pm and shuts at midnight and my wife Sofia and I love that one, it\u2019s cool.\n\nI have a Tuk Tuk when I\u2019m out there that says \u2018Taxi\u2019 on the side.\n\nI got it from Bangkok.\n\nI drive around and people stop me and ask how much to Ibiza Town.\n\nThen they see me in it and say, \u2018Oh my God, you\u2019re that guy who sang that song.\u2019\n\nThen they\u2019ll put a sympathetic hand on my shoulder and say, \u2018Oh no, man, what happened?\u2019\n\nI make the most of my holiday home and will do forever.\n\nI might even become a club DJ later in life, if I can get some good taste in music.\n\nWhatever happens I will live, and die, but not too soon, in Ibiza.\n\n- James Blunt's new album 'Once Upon A Mind' is out on October
