Trump also thanked Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Syrian Kurds for their support.\n\n\u201cIt is weird to thank Russia before in the line of when he thanked versus our troops, our special forces, the men and women in the military, the badasses who brought this freedom home for us,\u201d said McCain. \u201cYou thank our troops and the flag and America first. Period,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThis president does not feel the support of the country the way you would expect... because many people do not feel that he puts this country first,\u201d said co-host Sunny Hostin prompting fellow panelist Abby Huntsman to counter Hostin\u2019s argument with one of her own.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t put Russia in context, Sunny. You said he thanked Russia before he thanked our own leaders, but the reality is that this is the most dangerous mission that our military men and women can do,\u201d said Huntsman. \u201cHe thanked Syria and Turkey for their help because we couldn\u2019t have done it without their help,\u201d she added.\n\nViewers on Twitter were also split on the topic, with many saying McCain was right and that President Trump should have thanked the Americans who helped before he thanked Russia and others:\n\n.@TheView, making excuses for Trump thanking Russia before thanking our own troops.\n\nYou have lost it, Abby\n\nU & MAGA can just stfu, thank you very muich \u2014 Superguts\u2122 (@superguts) October 28, 2019\n\n@HuntsmanAbby credit goes to those who risks their lives praise for them absolutely however who did 45 congratulate first @HuntsmanAbby RUSSIA not those who risked their lives. Please! \u2014 Ikpazihuatl (@notlazotzin) October 28, 2019\n\nOthers disagreed and said Trump did nothing wrong:\n\nHE gave inclusive praise starting with the other countries first, but gave most praise to the men in action. You must be listening to the usual EDITED SNIPPETS. For God sake, we needed Russia to allow us through & we will need them again. \u2014 Cher (@Cher78920606) October 28, 2019\n\n@TheView . Sunny is unraveling like a cheap suit. Our military could have been slaughtered without Russia\u2019s support. We should thank them as we thanked the Kurds who still support us. \u2014 Tipper (@TipperDogDiary) October 28, 2019\n\nWendy Williams says Kathy Griffin needs to \u201ctake some blame\u201d for her career woes:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "description": "\"The View\" co-host Meghan McCain called out President Donald Trump for thanking Russia and other countries for their help in the Baghdadi raid before thanking American troops.", "authors": ["Todd Garrin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8Ohf44f0UGi4btFJ8JHzFg--~B/aD05MTg7dz0xMzYyO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/9613b580-f9bd-11e9-a7df-f4b640859230", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
