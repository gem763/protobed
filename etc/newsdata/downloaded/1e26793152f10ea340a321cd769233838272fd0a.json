Protesters have previously been hit before with bean bags rounds and rubber bullets and officers have fired live rounds in the air.\n\nVerified video footage of the incident widely shared on social media shows a chaotic melee with riot police battling protesters wielding metal bars, before an officer fires a shot at close range.\n\nAs the wounded man steps back and falls, someone tries to help, but another policeman tackles him to the ground.\n\n\u201cA large group of rioters was attacking police officers in Tsuen Wan,\u201d police said in a statement. \u201cPolice officers warned them, but they were still attacking police. A police officer\u2019s life was seriously endangered. In order to save his and other officers\u2019 lives, they fired at the attacker.\u201d\n\nThere were no immediate details on the wounded man\u2019s condition.\n\nFormer colonial ruler Britain said the use of live ammunition was disproportionate.\n\nNearly four months of street clashes and demonstrations have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and pose the most serious popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came to power.\n\nProtesters had vowed to seize the opportunity on China\u2019s National Day to propel their calls for greater democracy onto the international stage, hijacking an occasion Beijing sees as an opportunity to showcase China\u2019s economic and military progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not young, but if we don\u2019t march now, we\u2019ll never have the chance to speak again, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said one marcher near Causeway Bay, a 42-year-old woman with her own logistics company who identified herself as Li.\n\nPOLICE BAN DEFIED\n\nThousands of black-clad protesters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, marched on Admiralty, defying a police ban. Violence escalated across the harbor to Kowloon and beyond to the New Territories. Police vans chasing down pro-democracy protesters in the key drag of Hennessy Road.\n\nPolice said 31 people had been wounded across the territory, two critically, without giving details.\n\nProtester Jerry, 26, dressed in black and sitting amid the wreckage in Causeway Bay, denounced the police.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong police, they\u2019ve just lost their minds,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThey just follow orders. They say it\u2019s to protect lives, but they see the people as objects.\u201d\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab criticized the use of live ammunition.\n\n\u201cWhilst there is no excuse for violence, the use of live ammunition is disproportionate, and only risks inflaming the situation,\u201d Raab said in a statement.\n\nIn the Admiralty area, police fired water cannon and volley after volley of tear gas to disperse protesters throwing Molotov cocktails outside central government offices and ordered the evacuation of the Legislative Council building next door.\n\nPetrol bombs were also thrown at MTR metro stations, including at Causeway Bay and Admiralty and Sham Shui Po in the New Territories. Many stations were closed to stop protesters moving around. Shutting stations has made them a common target for attack during the weeks of unrest.\n\nAn anti-government protester shelters with a traffic sign during a demonstration in Sha Tin district, on China's National Day in Hong Kong, China October 1, 2019.

Roads to the center were closed and tightly policed.\n\nHong Kong had benefited from China\u2019s support under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy, Acting Chief Executive Matthew Cheng told the assembly, referring to guarantees of political freedoms after the city\u2019s handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nBut he said escalating violence was disrupting social order and hurting the economy.\n\nThe government of embattled leader Carrie Lam has already canceled an annual Oct. 1 fireworks display over the city\u2019s Victoria Harbour, citing public safety.\n\nLam, who was trapped in a stadium for hours last week after attending the \u201copen dialogue\u201d, left for Beijing on Monday to celebrate China\u2019s birthday on the mainland.\n\nIn contrast to events in Hong Kong, Beijing\u2019s carefully choreographed anniversary festivities included troops marching through part of Tiananmen Square with new missiles and floats celebrating the country\u2019s technological prowess.\n\nLam was shown on television smiling as a float celebrating Hong Kong went past as she sat with Chinese officials.\n\nThe Communist Party leadership is determined to project an image of national strength and unity in the face of challenges including Hong Kong\u2019s unrest.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\n\u201cOn our journey forward, we must uphold the principles of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems; maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau ... and continue to strive for the motherland\u2019s complete reunification,\u201d Xi said in a nationally televised speech in Beijing.\n\nHong Kong protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in the Asian financial center.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.", "description": "Hong Kong police shot a teenager on Tuesday, the first time a protester has been hit by live ammunition during four months of demonstrations, as the Chinese-ruled city was rocked by widespread unrest on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435852277&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902L2", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
