Each of my kids has a veritable army of special stuffies: My older daughter loves owls, my little one loves cats. So instead of just one V.I.P. animal to keep track of, my big girl can\u2019t fall asleep unless Fluffy; Fluffy\u2019s daughters, Pinkie Pie and Blueberry; Fluffy\u2019s sister, Fluffy 2; and Fluffy 2\u2019s daughter Bravey are all present and accounted for in her bed.\n\nI have scuffed up many sets of plastic eyes because I was not laundering these owls properly after they got smelly from overuse, dropped in mud or barfed on. Thanks to Jolie\u2019s expertise, I now realize that I should have been sticking all these gals in a garment bag before dumping them in the washing machine.\n\nWhile spot-cleaning Blueberry is not my favorite activity, I know that favored stuffed animals have a profound importance to our kids, and can help them cope in times of stress. Our children\u2019s most obsessed-over toys and blankets are called \u201ctransitional objects,\u201d a term coined in 1951 by the pioneering British psychoanalyst and pediatrician Donald Winnicott, after he observed that babies often became \u201caddicted\u201d to a particular special soft toy, which was \u201caffectionately cuddled as well as excitedly loved and mutilated.\u201d\n\nThough some pediatricians of his era took a more pathological view of \u201cfetishistic\u201d transitional objects, arguing that normally developing children should not need them, Winnicott believed that children\u2019s attachment to their lovies should be respected. Fortunately for Fluffy and Pinkie Pie, Winnicott\u2019s view has prevailed: Transitional objects are important because they help kids move from dependence to independence, from being exclusively in the care of their families to encountering the wider world.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, many kids fixate on their particular transitional objects between eight and 12 months old. And in fact, what adults perceive as the dirtiness and smelliness of the transitional object is part of what makes it soothing \u2014 that it has your child\u2019s particular scent on it \u201creminds him of the comfort and security of his own room,\u201d the A.A.P. notes.\n\nAnother fact about transitional objects that surprised and delighted me came from a 2013 Times piece. A developmental-behavioral pediatrician estimated that 25 percent of young women go off to college with transitional objects they have loved since they were tiny \u2014 and that\u2019s perfectly O.K. It shows that the process of becoming independent is yearslong. And by the time your kid is 18, at least washing that gross old blanky won\u2019t be your problem anymore.\n\nP.S.

Many parents have a backup lovey ready to go, but when children are 2 and up, they\u2019re going to know that it\u2019s counterfeit if it\u2019s too clean. Here\u2019s a guide from the writer Amy Ransom about how to convincingly weather a new stuffie.\n\nI adore this excerpt from the book \u201cMuch Loved,\u201d by Mark Nixon, which is a collection of photographs of \u201clovingly abused\u201d stuffed animals.\n\nIn 2018, the Times Magazine had a Letter of Recommendation that extols the joys of stuffed animals for people of all ages. The writer, Max Genecov, makes the case that adults need play, too. \u201cWith stuffed animals, there is no goal: It\u2019s all exploration and joy, doodling with your emotions.\u201d\n\nFrom Winnie-the-Pooh to Knuffle Bunny, kids\u2019 relationships with their stuffed animals have inspired children\u2019s authors for generations (and full disclosure: I cry at the end of \u201cKnuffle Bunny Free\u201d every single time I read it). If your child adores hearing stories about other kids and their stuffed animals, these lists from Goodreads and Bookroo include some lesser-known titles you might want to consider adding to your bedtime rotation.\n\nTiny Victories\n\nParenting can be a grind. Let\u2019s celebrate the tiny victories.\n\nWe had to embark on a sudden, white-knuckle potty training journey when my son started a new day care. After failing at every method of persuasion I could think of, I picked up his stuffed dinosaur and had the dino tell him how much fun it would be to go to the potty together. He smiled brightly at his toy, happily got up and went to the potty. I frequently used toys to convince him to go after that day, and it always worked! \u2014 Alison Bates, Avon, Ind.\n\nIf you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
