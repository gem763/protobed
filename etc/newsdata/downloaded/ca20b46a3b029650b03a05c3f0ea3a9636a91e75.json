A second message after the first complaint was rebuffed also referred to Walker\u2019s conduct.\n\nThe BBC did not dispute the content of the original complaints. But it argued that when the viewer was given the opportunity to appeal to the executive complaints unit, they were asked to clearly and concisely set out why they remained unsatisfied.\n\nA spokesperson said this third version of the complaint \u201cspecifically focused on Ms Munchetty\u2019s comments rather than Mr Walker\u2019s, which is why this was the focus of the ECU investigation\u201d.\n\nWith the text of the original complaint circulating at the organisation, the decision has created an open rebellion among BBC staff, with some demanding why a woman of colour was punished and not her white, male co-host.\n\nOne senior BBC journalist said there was fury at the decision: \u201cThey\u2019ve chosen to interpret the complaint as only being about Naga and made her a sacrificial lamb. The process is a mess. David Jordan has led two programmes to believe that the complaint wasn\u2019t about Dan Walker, when it clearly was.\u201d\n\nThe disclosure of the language in the original complaint, filed with the subject line of \u201cBlatant political bias from both presenters\u201d, will increase pressure on Jordan and amplify calls for fresh scrutiny of the editorial complaints process.\n\nThe message made clear that the viewer felt Walker \u201crepeatedly expressed incredulity\u201d about Trump\u2019s tweets and \u201cvery unprofessionally\u201d asked Munchetty for her personal views on the issue.\n\nThe original complaint said: \u201cDan Walker, whilst interviewing a guest about President Trump\u2019s recent tweets regarding 4 Democrat politicians in the USA, repeatedly expressed incredulity that anybody could defend Trump\u2019s tweets. Very unprofessionally, he then asked his fellow presenter Naga Munchetty for her personal opinions on this news story! She foolishly complied with his request and launched into an attack on Trump, including stating that she was personally \u2018furious\u2019 about his comments.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cThese two presenters have never made any secret of their left-wing and anti-Trump bias but usually in more subtle ways, such as eye-rolling and looks of exasperation when reporting on news stories. However, personal commentary on controversial news stories is surely going too far and is way outside of their remit. They are employed as presenters not political commentators and as such should at least feign impartiality. It\u2019s about time they were reminded of this.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Jordan: \u2018The simple fact is we haven\u2019t had a complaint about Dan Walker\u2019s role.\u2019 Photograph: PA Wire/PA\n\nThe BBC initially defended Munchetty, saying she \u201cmade it clear that she was making a general point and not accusing anyone of anything\u201d.\n\nThe viewer responded by sending a second complaint, asking for it to be investigated further and again referring to both presenters: \u201cDan Walker asked Naga Munchetty to comment SPECIFICALLY on the SPECIFIC tweet sent by a SPECIFIC person (President Trump). She said that she was SPECIFICALLY \u201cfurious\u201d about the SPECIFIC words used by that SPECIFIC person in a SPECIFIC tweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis could not possibly be construed as the making of a \u2018general point\u2019 by any reasonable person. I would like my complaint to be investigated again and a more honest reply sent please. If you are content for your supposedly impartial presenters to make biased political statements, just say so. If you are not, then my complaint should be upheld and words of advice given.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s defence of the corporation has relied on the claim that the viewer was solely concerned about Munchetty\u2019s conduct. In an interview with Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday, its editorial standards chief said Munchetty was \u201cled down that path unfortunately by her co-presenter [Walker] as you heard on that clip\u201d.\n\nPresenter Nick Robinson replied: \u201cWell, that raises the question some have asked \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get our fellow presenter into trouble \u2013 they say: well, why pick her out, if they\u2019re both guilty of it?\u201d\n\nJordan replied: \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid the executive complaints unit can only deal with the complaints that it receives.\u201d\n\nOn the corporation\u2019s Newswatch programme, Jordan said: \u201cI am afraid the executive complaints unit deals with the complaints it gets. Some people have said why isn\u2019t Dan Walker being singled out in the same way as Naga Munchetty? The simple fact is we haven\u2019t had a complaint about Dan Walker\u2019s role.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe complaint was about Naga Munchetty.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThey\u2019re obliged to deal with the complaints they have, not the complaints they might like to have or complaints that might be available.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the broadcaster said: \u201cThe appeal to the ECU focused on comments by one presenter, but the statement from the executive team on Friday is clear \u2013 the BBC is not impartial on racism. Racism is not an opinion and it is not a matter for debate. Racism is racism. Naga has the very clear support of the top of the organisation.\u201d", "description": "Exclusive: Walker also subject of original complaint - but BBC standards chief claimed only Munchetty was targeted", "authors": ["Jim Waterson", "Afua Hirsch", "Lenny Henry", "Adrian Lester", "Krishnan Guru-Murthy", "Micha Frazer-Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4127ea9141d6add096b3ad9a437542981e717e1/30_28_1753_1052/master/1753.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbd6f66279cbd9284f783a0a6a13f95b", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
