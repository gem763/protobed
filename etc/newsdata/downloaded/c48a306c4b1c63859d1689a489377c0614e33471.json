The company said at the time it \"did not fully appreciate the complexities of the acquisitions process\" and that it had relied on dealers' expertise.\n\nHobby Lobby's president Steve Green also serves as the chairman of the museum, which opened in 2017, and was behind its founding.\n\nAn Oxford University spokesman said: \"We can confirm we are engaging with the Egypt Exploration Society with regard to the allegations concerning papyri from the Oxyrhynchus Collection.\n\n\"The university is conducting its own internal investigation to seek to establish the facts.\"", "description": "It is alleged 11 items from a collection held at Oxford University were sold by Prof Dirk Obbink.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16B4E/production/_109260039_professor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
