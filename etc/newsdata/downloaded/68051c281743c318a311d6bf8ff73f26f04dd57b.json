(By Clarence Williams/TWP)\n\nGunshots were reported Saturday night near the Northwest Washington entertainment and nightlife hub of Ninth and U streets NW, but no immediate reports of any victims emerged.\n\nAlthough the sound of gunshots was reported, no victim was located, said Officer Sean Hickman, a police spokesman.\n\nAuthorities focused their attention on an automobile parked near the intersection, which had damage consistent with gunshots in the front windshield, according to a witness. Evidence markers had been placed in the street near the vehicle. The markers are often used by police to indicate spots where expended cartridges are found.\n\nA heavy police presence was visible in the area, and a helicopter circled overhead. Part of the roadway in the 2000 block of Ninth Street was shut down by police.\n\nWhat appeared to be actual shootings were reported by police Saturday night in the 2200 block of Alabama Avenue SE, and in the 2900 block of Knox Place SE. No information was available about the condition of any victims.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Car is found with apparent bullet holes, witness says.", "authors": ["Clarence Williams", "Local Reporter Covering Crime", "Breaking News", "Public Safety Issues", "Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9Ouf5Gp8ZFEyNSLDSErPOvZzamg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OPVXUGHNLUI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
