Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP\n\nThe Conservatives are looking anxiously ahead to next week when they are due to hold their party conference. Boris Johnson wanted to use the annual event to set up his domestic agenda for an election but it will be overshadowed by his unlawful prorogation and the return of MPs to parliament.\n\nJohnson faces political humiliation, but that will play well with some voters | Katy Balls Read more\n\nThe prime minister will try to secure a House of Commons recess but opposition parties are planning to oppose this, meaning his MPs may have to shuttle to and from Manchester while parliament is engaged in work to hold the government to account on Brexit.\n\nJohnson will no doubt hold \u2013 and lose \u2013 another vote to secure an election, which he will seek to paint as a sign that Labour is running scared of democracy. But at the same time, No 10 will no doubt do everything possible to minimise parliamentary scrutiny of its Brexit policy and prevent MPs trying to tighten the Benn law, which mandates Johnson to seek an extension to article 50 if no deal has been reached with the EU by 19 October.\n\nLabour\n\nJeremy Corbyn managed to end the Labour conference on a high after a shaky start to the weekend saw a failed coup attempt against Tom Watson and warring factionalism over the party\u2019s Brexit policy. In the end, he saw off attempts to make it a remain party and delivered a coruscating speech about Johnson\u2019s abuse of power. The party will now seek to block Johnson holding a conference recess and use parliamentary mechanisms to take no-deal Brexit off the table, before agreeing to an election. This might involve a confidence vote in Johnson\u2019s leadership, or simply voting for an election motion laid by the prime minister.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jo Swinson will not accept Corbyn as a caretaker PM. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nJo Swinson is still scooping up remain voters with her policy of revoking article 50, according to the polls, so her party would be likely to benefit from an early election. However, after supporting a no-confidence vote, the Lib Dems prefer the idea of a temporary government that would install a prime minister willing to hold a second referendum before an election. Swinson also will not countenance Corbyn as temporary prime minister, preferring a centrist figure from either main party such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman.\n\nThe SNP\n\nNicola Sturgeon came out with the hardest immediate stance towards Johnson after the supreme court judgment, saying he should resign if he had any decency. Like Labour, the party wants an election, partly because it is doing well in the polls in Scotland again, while the Tories have fallen back since the resignation of Ruth Davidson. It would back a no-confidence vote in Johnson when no deal is off the table, and is not opposed to the idea of Corbyn as interim leader.\n\n\n\n", "description": "As MPs return to parliament, we look at the main parties\u2019 aims and prospects", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/979d81904f629b8bd805538f7443ed65196bda82/82_0_4019_2412/master/4019.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=585ae14766bbf80593c8bf2c2b884712", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
