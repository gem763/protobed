He stands ready to testify on short notice, whenever he is permitted to appear.\u201d\n\nUkraine is not in the European Union but text messages released to Congress last week showed him working with Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker on ways to have Ukraine co-operate.\n\nThe two men also consulted Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney who was working on the Ukraine matter.\n\nVolker resigned his post before testifying to the House committees last week.\n\nThe White House appears to have calculated that Sondland\u2019s testimony might be more damaging than facing the wrath of the House over his absence. The wealthy Oregon hotelier was named ambassador to the EU last year after donating $1m to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund.\n\nCongress is on recess but committees investigating the president continue to work.\n\nA new Washington Post/Schar School poll released on Tuesday showed 58% support for the impeachment inquiry and 49% support for moving forward to impeach the president and attempt to remove him from office.", "description": "In Trump administration move likely to stoke further political fury, Gordon Sondland\u2019s appearance before House Democrats is blocked", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly", "Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f627f9af1fe31153a47a0f402307bc56e9cdfa16/0_174_3688_2213/master/3688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3940abce2b6da28caa7988f2fd9e743f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
