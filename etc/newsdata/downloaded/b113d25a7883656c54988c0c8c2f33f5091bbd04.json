That county also contains South Bend, the city where 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is mayor.\n\nSalt Lake City, where the only vice presidential debate will take place, is likewise a region in the vastly Republican state of Utah that voted Democratic in 2016.

Election Day is Nov. 3, 2020.\n\nIn the meantime, the Democratic National Committee's criteria continue to narrow the field for the party's primary debate stage, and the president has said he will not debate GOP primary opponents.\n\nElectability: Four decades separate 2020's presidential candidates.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/11/2020-dates-locations-announced-general-election-debates/3944404002/", "description": "The nonpartisan organization that sponsors presidential debates has released the schedule for the 2020 general election.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Published P.M.
