In 2005, Donald Trump was caught on tape bragging that his fame allowed him to sexually assault women. In 2016, as he was running for president, that recording, the so-called Access Hollywood tape, was made public, resulting in a stream of women coming forward and alleging that Trump had groped or otherwise sexually assaulted them. He was elected anyway; the women\u2019s stories didn\u2019t seem to matter. But they should.\n\nIf we have understood one thing in the two years since actor Alyssa Milano tweeted #MeToo, sending the then 11-year-old phrase viral, it is that when women are not listened to, men in positions of power are left free to abuse their authority. When the accused abuser is the president of the United States, those allegations and how they are handled matter all the more. Thanks to his bully pulpit, Trump\u2019s words and actions resonate far beyond the deeds themselves.\n\nAnd then there is the question of collective responsibility. If we avert our eyes from the allegations of Trump\u2019s abuse because we find it distasteful, we tacitly endorse his behaviour. When we dismiss or ignore his objectification and denigration of women, we legitimise it. Leaving these attitudes and actions unchecked allows them to proliferate.\n\nWhen the recording was released, Trump brushed it off as \u201clocker-room banter\u201d. A short time later he denied having had affairs with porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. We, however, conducted more than 100 interviews in the course of researching our book All the President\u2019s Women and found that the language and the affairs were not mere aberrations. Since his campaign, Trump has already faced allegations from nearly two dozen women. Our book reveals another 43 allegations, bringing the total to 67 accusations of inappropriate behaviour, including 26 instances of unwanted sexual contact. In short, far from being occasional or accidental, his alleged misconduct with women was regular and widespread. We found that Trump repeatedly and systematically engaged in aggressive sexual pursuit of women over many decades and that his alleged behaviour followed discernible patterns. One of those was a predilection for young models.\n\nAll of a sudden she heard someone shout: 'Put your robes on, here he comes!'\n\nIn the early 1980s, NaKina Carr was working in New York for Oscar de la Renta and was backstage in the models\u2019 dressing room at one of his fashion shows when she heard Trump\u2019s name mentioned for the first time. She was getting ready when all of a sudden she heard someone shout: \u201cPut your robes on, here he comes!\u201d\n\nAt 21, the Texas native was already on the older side for a catwalk model, who generally start working when they are in their teens, but she was new to New York and had no idea what was going on. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what they were talking about \u2026 but suddenly everyone threw on their dressing robes,\u201d Carr said, speaking publicly about her memories of Trump for the first time. Carr asked another woman what was wrong, and she pointed to a man across the room. \u201cShe said: \u2018He\u2019s the money man. He can do whatever he wants \u2026 Unless you\u2019re a gold digger, you avoid him at all costs.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump walked in as if he owned the place, according to Carr\u2019s account, with a pregnant Ivana, his first wife, trailing behind him. \u201cHe threw his arms wide open and said: \u2018OK now ladies, drop \u2019em,\u2019\u201d Carr said. \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ll always remember is the dejected look on Ivana\u2019s face in the dressing room. I thought how horrible, that he would treat her in this way.\u201d\n\nAs Trump strode around the dressing room, Carr concealed herself behind a pillar, incredulous that someone would be so crude. \u201cThe other girls were obviously afraid of him, like they knew he meant it and it wasn\u2019t a joke,\u201d she said. The model was later assured that she was not Trump\u2019s type \u2013 at the time the rumours among modelling insiders was that he preferred younger women. \u201cIf you\u2019re over 21 you don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d Carr said she was told.\n\nThose rumours appear to be backed up by other accounts of Trump during that era. Model Barbara Pilling was not yet 18 when her booker took her to a party a few days after her arrival in New York, in the summer of 1989. Trump was also in attendance. Pilling didn\u2019t know who the real estate developer was, but she noticed him looking at her. \u201cI could see him eyeing me up and watching me,\u201d she said. She claims that once he caught her gaze, Trump started talking to her. \u201cI remember him saying: \u2018Oh, how old are you?\u2019 And I said 17, and he said: \u2018That\u2019s just great; you\u2019re not too old, not too young.\u2019\u201d\n\nPilling said Trump tried to make small talk with her for a while, but his gaze kept veering to her chest. He asked her if she liked where she was living and said he knew great places she could stay if she didn\u2019t. Trump offered to show her the city and to take her to dinner. He told her she was gorgeous, like a dark-haired Marilyn Monroe, and asked her if she would ever consider going blond. \u201cI was starting to feel uncomfortable,\u201d Pilling remembered. \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling for a young girl to have an older man making advances on her.\u201d Another model standing nearby whispered to Pilling that Trump clearly liked her, and explained who he was. \u201cI wasn\u2019t impressed by it. I mean, I was only 17.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest From left: Rachel Crooks, Jessica Leeds and Samantha Holvey speak at news conference in New York, 2017.

Between that and her own conversation with him, Pilling was so disturbed that she left the party without saying goodbye to anyone.\n\nWhen the Australian Shayna Love was living in New York in 1991, she says models were encouraged to attend dinners that became occasions for \u201cmen to pick up girls\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019d go to these things and look pretty, give the men attention,\u201d Love said. She was 16 at the time and part of the Elite model agency\u2019s \u201cNew Faces\u201d campaign. \u201cWe might as well have been called \u2018fresh meat\u2019.\u201d Love recalled a dinner with Trump. \u201cThis time it was a private area, a big table and lots of girls \u2013 I\u2019d say around 10 to 15 of us, all between the ages of 14 and 18,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just us models, Trump and [Elite founder] John [Casablancas]. We were all underage, but we were offered drinks.\u201d Love said she went home early, but other girls stayed.\n\nTrump was often seen with Casablancas. He hosted events for Elite\u2019s modelling contests at his New York properties and provided lodging for the contestants. Eli Nessa had just turned 17 and was representing Norway during one such Elite competition hosted by Trump\u2019s hotel in the early 90s. In addition to the events for the competition, the women were expected to attend several nights of parties. \u201cThere were all these older men,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so seedy.\u201d Nessa was accompanied by her agent, but other women appeared to be alone. \u201cI remember this Italian girl, extremely naive, who couldn\u2019t speak any English. She was easy prey. They were all around her,\u201d Nessa said. \u201cWe were a bunch of kids, just put there with all these older men.\u201d\n\nHeather Braden was also an Elite model and, in the late 90s, alleges that she was instructed to go to a party in a mansion on one of the islands off Miami Beach. Trump was going to be there, she was told. Braden went with a couple of friends who were also models. When they arrived, the first thing they saw was a table manned by two security guards. The models were handed papers. \u201cI presume they were NDAs for us to sign,\u201d Braden recalled. They ignored the papers and walked into a big room where there were about 50 models. In her mid-20s, Braden was one of the oldest women there. Many were from eastern Europe and didn\u2019t speak English, so Braden and her friends kept to themselves.\n\nThey found the party odd. There was no DJ, no food, and no bartender \u2013 though there were drinks, Braden remembers. \u201cIt was very awkward from the beginning,\u201d she said years later. \u201cFifty females in this room, no real hosts. Very unusual. And then down this large staircase, in front of all of us, there was Donald Trump and behind him there were three actors, 40s, maybe 50s. I don\u2019t want to name them because they\u2019re all still around.\u201d The actors were famous. \u201cThey came down the stairs and spread out like sharks among the girls,\u201d who had broken up into little clusters throughout the room. \u201cObviously, some of these younger girls were starstruck.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Casablancas and Trump at the Elite Model Agency Look of the Year awards in 1991. Photograph: Ron Galella/Getty Images\n\nBraden said she had been in the industry long enough to understand what was happening. \u201cClearly, we were there for one reason. We were just pieces of meat.\u201d At a typical fashion industry party, there would be a mix of people, men of different ages, male models, men in the business. Not here. Braden believed that this party had been set up specifically for Trump and the three actors. \u201cThis was not eye candy,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re brought to these big parties like that, but this was different.\u201d\n\nFrom a couch in the farthest corner of the room, Braden and her friends watched as each man made his way through the knots of models. They started with the standard opening lines, asking the women their names and where they were from. \u201cFive minutes later \u2013 this is what they did to me: \u2018You want to come upstairs?\u2019 It was anything from, \u2018You want to see the rest of the house?\u2019 to \u2018Do you want to see the bedroom? The view?\u2019 Or \u2018Do you want to partake in party favours?\u2019 That was the terminology,\u201d Braden said. \u201cSometimes there\u2019d be a couple of girls that would go up together.\u201d Braden said Trump approached her at the party, and chuckled when she turned him down.\n\nIn addition to Casablancas, whose marriage ended after he had an affair with a 16-year-old Stephanie Seymour and who later married another one of his models when she was 17, Trump\u2019s social circle in the early 90s included Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender who allegedly ran a sex ring of underage girls. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor and in July 2019 was charged with two federal counts of sex trafficking before being found dead in his prison cell in an apparent suicide in August. Trump once said of Epstein: \u201cTerrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d\n\nEventually Trump found an easier way to surround himself with models: he started his own agency. Trump Model Management launched in 1999, the same year Trump divorced Marla Maples. When Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 another man with a taste for women who walk the runway \u2013 heard about Trump\u2019s new venture, he approvingly dubbed it \u201cone-stop date shopping\u201d.\n\n'Clearly, we were there for one reason \u2026 We were just pieces of meat'\n\nNow Trump had the models coming to him, and it is alleged that he introduced them to his sons. Ksenia Maximova said she worked for Trump Model Management in 2003 and 2004, and again a few years later. In 2004, when the Russian-British model was 18, her agent summoned her to a meeting in Trump Tower. \u201cHe said: \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just going to meet the owner of the agency,\u2019\u201d she said, speaking publicly for the first time about the encounter. \u201cAnd then he told me to get all dressed up, properly, because I was quite tomboyish, so he did tell me to put a nice dress on and some high heels and stuff.\u201d\n\nMaximova complied, and she and her agent took the elevator to Trump\u2019s offices. The developer was at his desk with Donald Jr, then 26, standing behind him, although they weren\u2019t introduced so Maximova didn\u2019t know this was Trump\u2019s son. She settled on a chair and Trump and her agent began talking. \u201cI was just kind of sitting there,\u201d she said. Trump asked her a few questions but for the most part didn\u2019t address her. Donald Jr was generally silent, too. \u201cIt was all really awkward because it was like: \u2018Let the grownups do the talking,\u2019 kind of thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just like I didn\u2019t matter and he didn\u2019t matter. I just thought he was some aide or something.\u201d\n\nMaximova was made to feel so inconsequential that she began wondering why she had been brought there in the first place. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get introduced much. It was more like just to actually show me, visually. It wasn\u2019t like anyone was interested in my personality or anything like that, so I was like: \u2018What\u2019s the point in this?\u2019\u201d She asked her agent as much when they were back in the elevator on their way down to the street. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that [Trump\u2019s son] is maybe looking for a girlfriend now,\u201d Maximova claims her agent told her. \u201cThat\u2019s when I got really angry and told him off and asked him to never, ever, please, do this kind of thing again, especially without my consent.\u201d\n\nBut even before he put the Trump brand on young models, he had found another business that ensured he would have a steady supply of beautiful young women in his life. In 1996, he purchased the Miss Universe Organisation, which also operates the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very great entertainment format,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt gets very high ratings, it\u2019s doing very well and we\u2019ll make it even better.\u201d Trump\u2019s improvement plan? \u201cI made sure the women were really beautiful because they were getting a little bit not as beautiful. They had a person who was extremely proud that a number of women had become doctors. And I wasn\u2019t interested,\u201d he said on the Howard Stern radio show. \u201cI made the bikinis smaller and the heels higher,\u201d he told the late-night TV host David Letterman in 2010.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump addresses the contestants in the Miss USA beauty pageant in 2012. Photograph: AP\n\nFrom the very beginning, Trump exercised what he saw as the owner\u2019s prerogative. \u201cI\u2019ll go backstage before a show, and everyone\u2019s getting dressed and ready and everything else,\u201d Trump told Stern in 2005. \u201cNo men are anywhere, and I\u2019m allowed to go in because I\u2019m the owner of the pageant and therefore I\u2019m inspecting it \u2026 \u2018Is everyone OK?\u2019 You know, they\u2019re standing there with no clothes. \u2018Is everybody OK?\u2019 And you see these incredible looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that.\u201d\n\nAt times, Trump\u2019s gaze was more targeted. Samantha Holvey told CNN that when she was 20 and competing in the 2006 Miss USA pageant, Trump made pointed visual inspections of all the contestants. \u201cHe would step in front of each girl and look you over from head to toe like we were just meat, we were just sexual objects, that we were not people,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know when a gross guy at the bar is checking you out? It\u2019s that feeling.\u201d Being ogled by Trump made Holvey feel \u201cthe dirtiest I felt in my entire life\u201d. She and her fellow contestants were also invited to private parties filled with \u201cold, rich, drunk guys ogling all over us\u201d, Holvey said.\n\nThese women are just a sample of those who have come forward with accusations against Trump; new allegations continue to emerge. And while Trump is the most visible of the influential men accused of predatory behaviour, he is far from an outlier, as even a cursory glance at recent headlines illustrates. Jeffrey Epstein. Harvey Weinstein. R Kelly. Hundreds of men were brought down in the wake of #MeToo as women began to share their stories.\n\nStill, these reckonings, while important, are not the ultimate solution, because the individual men are not themselves the core of the problem; that runs much deeper. These abuses took place over the course of decades and were far from secret. All too often, institutions sacrificed accusers to protect themselves and the coteries that ran them. If lasting and significant change is to take place, it will require a significant overhaul of the systems and societal attitudes that allowed that to happen.\n\n\u2022 Edited and extracted from All The President\u2019s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator by Barry Levine & Monique El-Faizy, published in the UK on 23 October by Trapeze (\u00a320) \u2013 to order a copy go to guardianbookshop,com \u2013 and in the US on 22 October by Hachette ($29).
