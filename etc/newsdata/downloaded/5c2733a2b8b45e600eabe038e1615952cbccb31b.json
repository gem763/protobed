As the Brave Blossoms prepare to take on Ireland at the Pacific coast venue on Saturday, the hosts and their supporters may not like what the matcha leaves are telling them.\n\nJamie Joseph\u2019s side will have needed every day of their generous seven-day turnaround to prepare for a clash that will require a repeat of their 2015 heroics against the Springboks if they are to avoid becoming sacrificial lambs in Ireland\u2019s unstoppable rise to the top of Pool A.\n\nMichael Cheika hits out at World Rugby over Hodge ban as Wallabies ring changes for Wales Read more\n\nJoseph appears to be among those who view a meeting with the Irish as an opportunity for rest and experimentation before Japan\u2019s decisive remaining pool fixtures against Scotland and Samoa.\n\nThe captain, Michael Leitch will begin the match on the bench, while No 8 Amanaki Mafi is back to full fitness, with prop Jiwon Koo, lock Luke Thompson \u2013 at 38 the oldest player in the tournament- and full-back Ryohei Yamanaka promoted from the reserves.\n\nWilliam Tupou has been switched to wing for the first time in his Test career. Pieter \u201cLappies\u201d Labuschagne, the South African-born flanker, will captain Japan in Leitch\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cMichael\u2019s obviously our captain but if we\u2019re going to be successful in achieving our goals, we\u2019re going to have to have impact and experience off the bench, all the best teams in the world have a great bench,\u201d Joseph said.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be in a position to win the match, it\u2019s going to come down to the last five or 10 minutes and we\u2019ll need clear leadership. As a coach, I get to have both things that we need, we have in form players who are playing very well and we have experience coming on.\u201d\n\nIreland have fond memories of Shizuoka, where the home support will turn the stands into a sea of red and white hoops, speckled with Irish green. When the teams last met there two years ago, the visitors ran out 50-22 winners \u2013a result that roughly reflects their average against Japan over the past 28 years.\n\nJapan\u2019s players can do little other than talk up their chances, knowing that they have already taken a bonus point on the opening night in a game they could not have afforded to lose to stand any chance of reaching the last eight.\n\n\u201cThe whole public is favouring the Ireland side, they are expected to win,\u201d the Japan scrum-half Yutaka Nagare told reporters after Joseph revealed the changes to the side that beat Russia \u2013 a match organisers said is likely to be confirmed as the most-viewed live event in Japan this year.\n\n\u201cBut we are pretty confident and we truly believe we can prove them wrong. It\u2019s about mentally believing that, getting the detail right, and having the confidence in our training and what we\u2019ve accumulated through the buildup and the tournament. We are confident we can beat anyone. Whether Ireland are the best team in the world, we\u2019ve prepared well, so we\u2019re confident we can beat them.\u201d\n\nAfter a week that decided which two teams will compete in baseball\u2019s Japan Series next month, most of the country\u2019s supootsu shimbun \u2013 sports newspapers \u2013 relegated the build-up to the Ireland match to the inside pages on Friday.\n\nSports Nippon did, though, devote a double-page spread to Joseph\u2019s team selection, predicting that Saturday\u2019s game would be the \u201cbattle of the high punt\u201d and claiming that Japan would be able to exploit Ireland\u2019s \u201cweak points.\u201d\n\nA subhead implored the players to summon the sprit of Brighton 2015 and carry off what would be the upset of the tournament so far. Similar sentiments informed front-page coverage in Nikkan Sports, which called on Joseph to \u201clead Japan to a miracle.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ireland\u2019s Jack Carty during kicking practice before Saturday\u2019s match, with the fly-half replacing the injured Johnny Sexton.

In terms of legacy for the tournament, on our goals, as a team we want to do something we\u2019ve never done before and that\u2019s make the top eight.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones\u2019s masterminding of the \u2018Brighton Miracle\u2019 has been immortalised in a film of the same name released on the eve of the tournament. A similar feat against Ireland will secure Joseph\u2019s personal legacy in his adopted home as the man remembered for the sequel \u2013 the Shizuoka Shock.", "description": "Four years after World Cup heroics against South Africa, Japan\u2019s players must play the game of their lives to upset Ireland", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e9e684cc1f66399021ab0f919807c2d766d07de/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=726e0eb2ef0b6630ce7239128e3808ce", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
