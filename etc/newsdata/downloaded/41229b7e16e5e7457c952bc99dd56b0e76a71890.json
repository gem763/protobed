The institutions were set up by the Canadian government and run by churches. (Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\nFrom the 1870s to the 1990s, many Indigenous kids were sent to residential schools as a way to integrate them into Canadian culture.\n\nMany students were abused at the schools and prevented from practising their traditions.\n\nWhile residential schools no longer exist in Canada, the shaming continues in many ways.\n\n'I heard a snip'\n\nTheland said he\u2019s been bullied because of his hair \u2014 and he\u2019s not alone.\n\nLast year, when Rafe Vadnais was 11 years old, another student cut off part of his braid at a Calgary school.\n\n\u201cI heard a snip,\u201d Rafe told CBC News at the time, and \"I saw hair and the elastic on the floor.\u201d\n\nThese photos of Rafe Vadnais were taken on May 28, 2018. Later that day, another student tried to cut off his braid. (Submitted by Shantel Tallow)\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nRafe\u2019s mother, who is a member of the Kainai First Nation in southern Alberta, said she was taught what long hair meant to the Blackfoot people when she was young.\n\nShantel Tallow said she passed that teaching on to her son.\n\nIn her culture, she said, hair is only to be cut as a sign of respect when a loved one dies.\n\nA prayer is also said every time you braid, which sets the tone for the rest of the day.\n\nTheland, who is from the Walpole Island First Nation in Bkejwanong territory in southwestern Ontario, has a similar ritual.\n\nListen to Theland describe his morning routine:\n\nTheland is part of an online collective called Boys with Braids, which celebrates Indigenous boys and their hair.\n\nMichael Linklater, who is Nehiyaw (Cree) from Thunderchild First Nation in Saskatchewan and a player with the Canadian Elite Basketball League, started the network when he saw how his two sons were being teased for their hair.\n\nThe movement has sparked a hashtag, as well as events across Canada and the U.S.\n\nThe founder of the Boys with Braids online collective, Michael Linklater, said his goal is to give Indigenous boys the tools they need to challenge bullies. (Submitted by Michael Linklater)\n\nTheland said it \u201cmeans a lot\u201d to be part of the network, because he can \u201cshow the next generation\u201d how to wear braids.\n\nAs for boys who are considering embracing their long hair, he said he would give them the same advice his mom gave him when he first started wearing a braid.\n\n\u201cDon't be afraid of what people are going to think,\u201d he said. Instead, focus on \u201cwhat's right for you.\u201d\n\nWith files from the Canadian Press, Unreserved/CBC Radio", "description": "Canada has a long history of shaming Indigenous men and boys who have long hair, but some boys are fighting back.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/BoyBraids_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
