But Turkey top the group on the head-to-head rule.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has scrapped plans to attend a football match between France and Turkey Monday in what is", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/ceb6ff_turkey-coach-senol-gunes-speaks-his-players-euro-2020-qualifier-france-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
