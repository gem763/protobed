Raheem Sterling\u2019s maiden Champions League hat-trick rendered the first red card of Phil Foden\u2019s career a footnote.\n\nIf that was attributable to the folly of youth, Sterling epitomises Pep Guardiola\u2019s perpetual quest for exponential improvement and this was another milestone in his development. His treble was all the more notable as it came in 11 minutes, and he had also set up both of Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s five-minute double. On the night, as in his time at City, it was quite a turnaround Sterling instigated. Having trailed, City overwhelmed Atalanta to take a five-point lead at the summit of Group C. The knockout stages beckon.\n\n\u201cI am so satisfied with the result,\u201d said Guardiola. Whenever he praises an opponent\u2019s attacking gameplan while previewing a match, it can be the prelude to a thrashing. So it proved. \u201cI really admire them for their bravery,\u201d the City manager said, but bravery backfired for the Italian side.\n\nSerie A\u2019s top scorers had a goal disallowed, with Remo Freuler denied, could easily have added others and were enterprising and entertaining. But City capitalised as Atalanta attempted to man-mark across the pitch. They had no individual capable of halting Sterling. They remain pointless.\n\n\u201cRaheem was brilliant,\u201d Guardiola added. \u201cHe is an incredible player for us.\u201d It was high praise, but his perfectionism is rubbing off on his players. \u201cPerfect night,\u201d said Sterling. \u201cBut I should have had four.\u201d He rued the moment when Foden released him and he rolled a shot past the far post.\n\nThree sufficed to make him only the eighth Englishman to score a Champions League hat-trick. All of the other seven are strikers by trade and Sterling\u2019s treble came from the left flank, each showing his capacity to cut infield. His first goal, and City\u2019s third, stemmed from a powerful surge from Kevin De Bruyne, followed by a sharp turn that left Rafael Toloi on his backside. The Belgian found Foden whose selflessness was apparent as he squared the ball to Sterling, in a better position, to lift his shot into the roof of the net.\n\nTottenham v Red Star Belgrade: Champions League Group B \u2013 live!

He helps us a lot.\u201d\n\nHe aided, abetted and assisted Ag\u00fcero. It was the Argentinian\u2019s destiny to be eclipsed by Sterling but, if City were relieved when he escaped unhurt from a car crash last week, he inflicted some damage on Atalanta, who led for six minutes before, in a mirror image of Sterling\u2019s first goal, Ag\u00fcero applied a deft touch to the winger\u2019s chipped cross. His second came from the penalty spot after Andrea Masiello felled Sterling.\n\nIt amounted to a busy night for the referee, Oscar Grinfeld, who awarded each side a spot-kick. The one City gave away may have illustrated the perils of playing without specialist centre-backs. It was perhaps more of a surprise that Guardiola operated without a Silva, with both David and Bernardo rested, than that he began with two midfielders at the heart of the defence. It became an awkward night for both. Rodri hobbled off with a hamstring strain as the injury curse of City\u2019s centre-backs, permanent or makeshift, continued. \u201cTen days [out],\u201d predicted Guardiola. \u201cThree weeks if it is broken.\u201d Before then, Fernandinho betrayed his unfamiliarity with the position by getting his geography wrong when he caught Josip Ilicic inside the box. Ruslan Malinovskyi dispatched the resulting penalty.\n\nThe Ukrainian was fouled for Foden\u2019s first yellow card. His second seemed inevitable when he tugged back Marten de Roon, although Guardiola, who gave the teenager a consolatory pat on the back on his way off, confronted the fourth official. \u201cHe told me not to talk too much because he wanted to show me the yellow card,\u201d said the City manager.\n\nHe was happier to discuss Foden\u2019s influential display, saying he had selected a player granted only 11 minutes of Premier League football this season in part because of his box-to-box running power. \u201cHe has to be a bit more clever when he has the yellow,\u201d he said. \u201cYellow card, be careful. But that experience is going to help him. With Phil, the important thing is not the red card but the way he played.\u201d He will not take further disciplinary action against the dismissed midfielder. \u201cI never fine except for a stupid thing. He played so well that maybe I have to pay him [more].\u201d", "description": "Raheem Sterling claimed a second-half hat-trick as Manchester City crushed Atalanta 5-1", "authors": ["Richard Jolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba0ecd9426e3240097aa15d6165265ca5e7fc58/0_156_3851_2311/master/3851.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=050d983d951d1e366f24756e4d61e52d", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
