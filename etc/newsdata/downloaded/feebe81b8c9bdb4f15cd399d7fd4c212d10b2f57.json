He had voted for Barack Obama, but in 2016 he took a gamble on Donald Trump. Although he called the president\u2019s conduct in office \u201ca joke,\u201d he was unwilling to commit to voting Democratic in 2020, unconvinced by the 10 party hopefuls the night before.\n\nJump ahead to October and Democrats in Congress are investigating evidence of President Trump\u2019s possible abuse of power.

He hopes Democrats nominate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., but he is not particular. \u201cI\u2019d vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Mr. Trump gets into another four years, where he\u2019s a lame duck, it\u2019s going to be like adding gasoline to the fire.\u201d\n\n[Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?]\n\nHeading into 2020, there is intense focus among campaign strategists on the weakest element of the Trump coalition: the millions of voters who disapproved of both major candidates in 2016 but took a chance on Mr. Trump. Whether an impeachment inquiry moves Obama-Trump voters like Mr. Graham off the fence, one way or the other, is a major narrative arc in the 2020 script that is rapidly unfolding and updating.", "description": "After taking a chance on Donald Trump in 2016, a swing county in western Pennsylvania is up for grabs again.", "authors": ["Trip Gabriel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/us/politics/07erie2-01/merlin_160974726_3a9fb195-61ce-4bb6-bbdf-b5d1c24b1aed-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
