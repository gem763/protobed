They hold a unique place in the national imagination, having been used by samurais, nobles and martial artists alike.\n\nBut long after the abolition of the samurai class (and the outlawing of public weapon-carrying), the artisans' ancient production techniques live on. Shimojima specializes in a historic style of sword known as mamori katana -- a lucky charm that can protect its owner from illness and misfortune.\n\nShimojima may take a month to produce a single sword, with more complex additions able to take production time to more than a year.

Their role in Japanese society has changed dramatically since then, though the production process remains largely the same.\n\nThe blades are forged from tamahagane, a steel whose layers contain differing amounts of carbon. Shimojima painstakingly heats, softens and then folds the steel in order to remove impurities and even out the carbon content.\n\n\"A single layer becomes two layers, then two become four, four become eight and so on,\" he explains. \"By folding 15 times, over 32,000 layers are produced. However, it does not mean that the more layers, the better. There's of course a limit, and if you exceed the limit you lose ... the strength required to serve as a sword.\"\n\nNext, the sword is shaped -- although it begins completely straight. As the steel is hardened through a process of repeated heating and cooling, the differing densities in the blade's structure create its signature curve.\n\n\"In the space of 10 minutes, we heat up the blade to about 800 degrees centigrade and rapidly cool it down in water,\" Shimojima says. \"It seems like a simple process. However... it's a matter of making a split-second judgment.\n\n\"One mistake can often lead to a total failure -- a fatal mistake,\" he adds.\n\nShimojima's traditional techniques differ little from those used by Japanese swordsmiths for centuries.

Shimojima's workshop may take a month to produce a single sword, with more complex additions (like mountings and hand guards) sometimes taking production time to over a year.\n\nTradition in decline\n\nDespite the katana's storied past, the trade is in steady decline. In the late 1980s, the Japanese Swordsmith Association reported around 300 members among its ranks. That number has reportedly dwindled by almost half in the years since.\n\nAcquiring mastery is laborious, and apprenticeships take years to complete and are often unpaid.\n\nSworsmiths harden steel through a process of repeated heating and cooling.

Struck by its flawlessness, it was an encounter that led him to peruse a career in sword making.\n\n\"Throughout its history, (the craft) has been passed down over generations without ever changing its shape, its stance, its values or its meaning,\" he says.\n\n\"The fact that (old katanas) have not been covered in rust, nor have they begun to decay, proves their quality. Therefore, we must spare no effort, even for the (swords') unnoticeable parts.\n\n\"I do not believe that Japanese swords themselves will disappear from this world,\" he adds. \"Good-quality katanas from the old days will always survive and be remembered.\"\n\nThe swords must undergo an extensive polishing process that can take weeks to complete.

They are, however, no substitute for the real thing.\n\n\"Every step of its production process, as well as the reasons behind it, are all for its practical use, and its beauty comes as a result of that,\" Shimojima says of his traditional techniques. \"I believe the beauty of a Japanese katana lies within its simplicity -- its aesthetics without any unnecessary elements.\n\n\"Functional, yet with a hidden elegance.\"", "description": "The samurai may be long gone, but a handful of Japanese artisans are keeping their legendary swords alive.", "authors": ["Oscar Holland", "Temujin Doran", "Saitama"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181004110429-samurai-sword-tease-1-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-16"}
