Earnings referred to an individual\u2019s mid-career household income.\n\n\u201cIndividuals whose households were in the top two quintiles (top 40 percent) of the mid-career earnings distribution were more likely than their counterparts in the bottom 60 percent to be alive in 2014 (ages 73 to 83),\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nAside from income, sex, race and education levels also factored into longevity \u2013 women, non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, as well as more educated individuals tended to have longer lifespans. Those conditions were controlled for in the analysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research also showed a growing concentration in wealth.\n\nWhile incomes rose across all groups examined, it did so disproportionately for the wealthiest quintile \u2013 the average income of households in the top 20 percent was $242,000 in 1989 and $398,000 in 2016. That compares to the bottom quintile, which had an average income of $9,000 in 1989 and $14,000 in 2016. Trends were comparable for changes in net worth.\n\nEven within the top 20 percent \u2013 a disproportionate amount of wealth is held by the top 1 percent, the study found.\n\nOverall, while wealthier Americans may live longer \u2013 people with characteristics typically associated with shorter lifespans also saw life expectancies rise, which is important as more Americans retire.\n\nBy 2030, for example, one in three Americans will be aged 55 or older.\n\nThe study found that Americans in the bottom 20 percent will rely more heavily on Social Security benefits as a source of financial security in retirement \u2013 compared to the top two quintiles of Americans who depend primarily on wealth.\n\nAnother thing that can have a serious impact on financial security? Debt, which also has an outsized effect on the lowest-income Americans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Individuals in the top 40 percent of earners were more likely to live to ages 73 to 83.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/12/0/0/bills-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
