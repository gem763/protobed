Mueller III.\n\nThe hearing began on Tuesday afternoon with Lewandowski deftly rebuffing Democratic attempts to find out more about the meeting he had with Trump in the Oval Office on June 19, 2017. During that meeting, Trump wanted Lewandowski to prevail on then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russian investigation, to somehow bring the investigation to a close. Lewandowski ultimately declined to approach Sessions, who was fired by Trump in late 2018. Mueller continued his investigation and his report on electoral interference, as well as Trump\u2019s alleged obstruction of investigations into that interference, releasing it to the public last April.\n\nIn the opening hours of his testimony, Lewandowski sparred with the committee\u2019s chairman, Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and the committee\u2019s other Democrats, to the delight of the president. Republicans on the committee frequently came to Lewandowski\u2019s defense, depicting the closely-watched proceedings as little more than a political spectacle engineered by Trump\u2019s political enemies.\n\n\u201cIt's a disaster so far,\u201d said former federal prosecutor Joyce Alene White Vance on MSNBC as Lewandowski continued to irritate Democrats with evasive non-answers. \u201cI don't think that this is going the way Democrats intended for it to go.\"\n\nBut things took a marked turn in the final half hour, when Lewandowski was questioned by Barry Berke, a respected criminal defense attorney hired by the committee\u2019s Democrats in February. Along with Berke, the Democrats hired Norman L. Eisen, the former Obama ethics lawyer who has been an unrelenting critic of the Trump administration. Eisen sat grimly behind Berke as the latter conducted a relentless cross-examination of the afternoon\u2019s sole witness (two other Trump administrations officials, Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn, had been subpoenaed to testify, but the White House cited executive privilege in instructing them not to appear, a request with which both men complied).\n\nBy the time Berke\u2019s moment came, it was approaching the dinner hour on the East Coast and it was unclear just how many Americans had the stamina to stay with the hearing until its end. Still, Berke managed to do what none of the committee\u2019s Democrats could, puncturing Lewandowski\u2019s aura of impregnable bravado.\n\nCorey Lewandowski testifies during a House Judiciary Committee hearing, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019, in Washington.

He zeroed in on Lewandowski\u2019s media appearances, as well as his writing on the Trump administration.\n\nAt the opening of his questioning, Berke played a clip of Lewandowski appearing on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in March 2018 and telling host Chuck Todd that he had not yet been approached by Mueller or his team for an interview. In fact, such an interview was to take place shortly, as Berke pointed out, the obvious suggestion being that Lewandowski had lied, and the deeper implication being that he had been untruthful in other instances as well.\n\nTo reinforce the point, Berke played another clip of Lewandowski on MSNBC last February. In that interview, Lewandowski said that he did not remember the president asking him to \u201cget involved\u201d in the Russia investigation. Mueller\u2019s report would in fact make clear that Trump did make such a request.\n\nBerke drove the point home. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t true, was it, sir?\u201d he pressed Lewandowski.", "description": "When Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee turned to criminal defense lawyer Barry Berke to question Cory Lewandowski, the tenor of Tuesday's hearing abruptly changed.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IwWADv.UcEDXjCU2gIdHYQ--~B/aD0xODU5O3c9Mjc4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/02240a70-d9c2-11e9-be7e-21260905c8b2", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
