A little over a month ago, Bolton was fired as White House national security adviser; now, he is poised to play a central role in a scandal that embroiled Trump and his allies, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFiona Hill, formerly the White House\u2019s top adviser on Russia, this week told House investigators looking into the impeachment of Trump that Giuliani ran a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine designed to personally benefit the president. According to those with knowledge of her testimony, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose details of her deposition, Hill recounted a number of moments when Bolton, her direct superior at the White House, had angrily objected.\n\nThe national security adviser was furious about Giuliani\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals, telling others that the former New York mayor was a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d Bolton had also gone \u201cballistic\u201d after one meeting that involved Giuliani, Hill said, according to an official who gave details of the testimony.\n\nThere is now speculation about whether Bolton could be called to testify to impeachment investigators and if he were to talk, what he might reveal. He has no reason to hold back: Bolton left the office on bad terms \u2014 publicly disputing whether he was fired at all \u2014 and he has already privately criticized Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs he was walking on the floor, I asked Adam Schiff if he wanted to bring in John Bolton - and first he said \u201cnot at this time,\u201d in what could be interpreted as he didn\u2019t want to bring in Bolton\n\nThen he came back to clarify he meant to say he didn\u2019t want to comment \u201cat this time\u201d \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) October 16, 2019\n\nBolton can be both calculated and combative. He is not a cautious career wonk like Hill or a diplomat like Michael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Pompeo who testified Wednesday, but a former Fox News pundit: He once wrote that being called \u201chuman scum\u201d by North Korea was \u201cthe highest accolade I received.\u201d\n\nBut while Bolton\u2019s revenge may be vindicating, it will also be bittersweet. Any standoff with the White House will add to the idea that despite his fierce reputation, rigid worldview and lengthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9, his legacy in the Trump administration was easily overshadowed by an impulsive president\u2019s instincts and whims.\n\nHe was forced to watch the president fawn over North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after months of missile tests. As diplomatic outreach remains stalled, North Korea\u2019s state media ominously announced Wednesday that Kim, riding a white horse on a sacred mountain, planned \u201ca great operation to strike the world with wonder again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd though Bolton helped convince Trump to leave the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and other world powers, economic pressure on Tehran has only resulted in an escalation of military tensions that Trump seems ill-equipped for. According to reports, Bolton\u2019s ouster came after he disagreed with a proposal to ease sanctions on Iran to facilitate a meeting.\n\nThere were other clashes over policy concerning Venezuela and Afghanistan, where Trump began to ignore his own adviser\u2019s advice. Bolton\u2019s isolation on policy issues is also evident on Ukraine, where it turns out senior figures such as White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and diplomats such as Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, were circumventing him.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement last week that he intended to pull U.S. troops out of northeast Syria was another blow to Bolton\u2019s legacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe move ceded control of the area to Turkey and Syrian forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad, while leaving the Syrian Kurds who had allied with the United States to fight the Islamic State. It contradicted promises Bolton had made in January, when he said the United States would need to ensure that Kurdish groups \u201cwho have fought with us in Syria\u201d would not be put in \u201cjeopardy\u201d by any withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country.\n\nThe national security adviser earned personal condemnation from Turkish President Recep Tay\u00adyip Erdogan for the remarks.\n\n\u201cThe message that Bolton gave in Israel is unacceptable. It is not possible for us to swallow,\u201d Erdogan said during a televised address to lawmakers in his political party, as he refused to meet with Bolton during his visit to Ankara.\n\nAD\n\nEven for critics of Trump, the idea of Bolton as a whistleblower is unpalatable. His reputation as a hawk and history of calling for military strikes against countries such as Iran and North Korea have left many feeling uneasy at the portrayal of him as righteous.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI mean, I knew John Bolton believed in regime change, but I always assumed he meant overseas,\u201d Charles P. Pierce wrote sardonically in Esquire.\n\nThough Bolton didn\u2019t leave a list of achievements from his time in the White House, he did pursue his own ambitions. He was given free rein to follow his unilateral obsessions, attacking agencies in the United Nations and the International Criminal Court, and sidelining the traditional multiagency foreign policy process.\n\nAD\n\nTrump say he didn't know John Bolton didn't get along with Rudy Giuliani https://t.co/qKUuPxKCvA pic.twitter.com/j6jcqqpLMP \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd when it came to issues such as Syria, Iran and North Korea, Bolton\u2019s greatest impact was in what he stopped from happening, be it pulling the United States out of the Iran deal or, according to many reports, scuppering talks with North Korea in Hanoi.\n\nWhen Trump first announced he would pull U.S. troops out of Syria late last year, it was Bolton and others who rushed to scale back the announcement. Bolton\u2019s help blocking that withdrawal, rather than organizing a pullout that would address both Turkish and Kurdish concerns, contributed to the chaotic pullback last week.\n\nAD\n\nBrett McGurk, former special envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State, told the Daily Beast this week that Bolton had insisted the United States would stay in Syria until Iran left and that U.S. officials blocked attempts by Kurdish forces to plan for an American exit.\n\nAD\n\nFor Bolton, getting revenge on Trump after his unceremonious exit from the president\u2019s orbit may prove to be deeply satisfying. But for many others, his time inside government and outside still leaves a bad taste in the mouth.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
