It\u2019s not the corporations that are in the crosshairs, but rather the local franchisee, the Maxim\u2019s Group, which is detested for its close ties to mainland China.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe pressure, however, is arguably even more intense from the other side. Beijing has been hypervigilant about any local or international corporation that has expressed even a shred of sympathy for the protest movement.\n\nAmong the hardest hit has been Hong Kong\u2019s own Cathay Pacific Airways, where about three dozen employees have been fired for comments perceived as supporting the pro-democracy demonstrators.\n\nBut jitters have spread beyond the city\u2019s borders, with shoe brand VANS, Spanish fashion house ZARA and even the National Basketball Association finding themselves caught between Hong Kong and Beijing.\n\nChinese state TV cancels broadcasts of NBA preseason games and sponsors drop out in dispute over Hong Kong comments\n\nThe mounting pressure from protesters and authorities in Beijing is exposing a harsh truth for Hong Kong. Its days as a Western-friendly global financial hub, perfectly-positioned to access the lucrative Chinese market, appear numbered. Hong Kong\u2019s strong suit has become its weakness as companies find themselves trapped on either side of a spiraling confrontation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHong Kong as Asia\u2019s World City is finished. There is no way that Hong Kong can recapture its reputation as an efficient, safe, well governed, orderly place to live and work and do business anymore,\u201d said Mike Chinoy, a Hong Kong-based nonresident senior fellow at the University of Southern California\u2019s US-China Institute. \u201cSome of this stuff you can\u2019t put back together.\u201d\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam, in a news conference Tuesday, acknowledged that Hong Kong\u2019s economy is being battered, saying that last quarter\u2019s economic data is likely to be \u201cvery bad.\u201d Goldman Sachs in a research note last week estimated that up to $4 billion in capital left Hong Kong for Singapore over the summer.\n\nIn an American Chamber of Commerce survey last August, half of respondents believed Hong Kong\u2019s reputation as a regional base has been tarnished, along with its status as a \u201cmodel of effective and business-friendly governance.\u201d\n\nMore than 80 percent of companies polled said the ongoing unrest is affecting plans for future investments.\n\nThe survey was conducted even before the campaign against brands believed to have pro-China links. Police said Tuesday that there were over 200 cases of vandalism over the past four days, crimes that go \u201cbeyond the freedom of speech argument\u201d and will be punished in accordance with the law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAside from the MTR Corporation, the subway operator seen to now be siding with authorities to suppress the protests, demonstrators have taken aim at the franchises operated by Maxim\u2019s Group, Chinese banks and chambers of commerce, and businesses run by the Fujian community, a group from a southeastern Chinese province that has suspected links to pro-Beijing organized crime.\n\nSome have even created guides and fliers, disseminated online and plastered all over Hong Kong, instructing their fellow protesters about what to target \u2014 hoping to instill some discipline and counter the government narrative that they are indiscriminate rioters.\n\nUsing cute graphics featuring a cartoon pig, the leaflets describe why one business should be smashed up and another supported. They have apologized to those inadvertently targeted, like a HSBC bank branch graffitied along with a Bank of China branch, and helped them clean up the mess.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmerican brands like Starbucks, which declined to comment on this story, are now being pushed to rethink their association with these local Hong Kong businesses, or risk their stores being routinely damaged and boycotted.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t trust a business anymore once they have betrayed us,\u201d said Sam, a 32-year-old front line protester who on Sunday threw a petrol bomb into Xiaomi store, the prominent Chinese electronics brand. \u201cWe Hong Kongers are beginning to know how to make a choice, to support the pro-democracy stores rather than pro-Beijing megacorporations.\u201d\n\nYet for others, it is the pressure from Beijing and the full force of the Chinese government that is harder to ignore than that of the protesters.\n\nAD\n\nChina\u2019s pressure has extended to global banks like HSBC, Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas. The international French bank distanced themselves from bank lawyer Jason Ng, after he posted a pro-democracy post criticizing pro-China supporters on Facebook late last month. He has since resigned.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt has become clear to me that I can no longer juggle my day job and my activism work,\u201d wrote Ng on Facebook. \u201cIf I must pick one, I will always choose the latter and I did.\u201d\n\n\u2018We too love money more than freedom\u2019: South Park creators issue mock apology over reported Chinese censorship\n\nFelix Chung, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, said concerns about Beijing\u2019s influence on international companies working in Hong Kong, and doing business in the mainland, were overblown.\n\n\u201cIf people worry about China, how come there are so many international companies and multinational companies that step into the Chinese market?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf they think China is a very dictating country why do they still do business with China?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cbig market,\u201d he added, presents an opportunity for \u201cbig money.\u201d\n\nIt comes with a big price as Hong Kong\u2019s airline, Cathay Pacific found out as one of the earliest and most dramatic examples of how far Beijing\u2019s authority could reach into Hong Kong.\n\nAD\n\nAfter singling out the airline and its 20,000 Hong Kong-based staff, China\u2019s aviation regulator forced an overhaul of policy at the airline and barred those who had participated in protests from flying into or over the mainland. The chief executive, one of his deputies and the chairman have been replaced.\n\nOnce told that they would never be penalized for their political leanings, union representatives, as well as current and former Cathay employees, say a purge has begun, resulting in the firing of over 30 employees believed to have even mild protest sympathies.\n\nAD\n\nThe Washington Post spoke to more than half a dozen former employees of Cathay Pacific and its regional arm, Cathay Dragon, who told nearly identical stories of abrupt firings after they were confronted by superiors with printouts of their private social media accounts and conversations in encrypted messaging groups.\n\nAD\n\nOne 36-year-old flight attendant, who worked there for 12 years, was fired for discussing over the WhatsApp the possibility of providing food vouchers to protesters \u2014 something she never followed through on.\n\nTurbulence at Cathay Pacific: China\u2019s threats loom over one of Asia\u2019s leading airlines\n\nAll of the terminated Cathay staff who spoke to The Post said they were now seeking jobs outside of the airline industry noting that three of the four airlines based in Hong Kong are owned by Cathay, the other, Hong Kong Airlines, is owned by a Chinese company.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo [airline] company would take a chance on me if they heard about what happened,\u201d said 34-year-old Yeung, a senior flight attendant terminated last month after 13 years of service.\n\nIn an emailed response to questions, a spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said the company \u201cfully supports the upholding of the Basic Law,\u201d referring to the framework that gives Hong Kong significant autonomy from China, but also has to comply with regulations in all jurisdictions they fly to.\n\nAD\n\nFor many however, it is the increasing acquiescence to the regulations in mainland China that are forever changing Hong Kong and taking away what once made it so attractive for business.\n\n\u201cPeople still don\u2019t understand how terrible this place could be, if the whole place is turned into China under the Cultural Revolution,\u201d said Yeung. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize this place anymore.\u201d\n\nTiffany Liang contributed to this report.\n\nWith threats and propaganda, China tries to silence support for Hong Kong protests\n\nHong Kong hit with Fitch rating downgrade over worries of \u2018rule of law\u2019\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s position as a gateway to mainland China may now come with more risk than opportunity.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Timothy Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WcthMZ8gp4D_IY8OOROE9C1fNQk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OEKXLXJXQI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
