American law enforcement officials also believe him to be the head of the Cartel de los Soles, a multi-continental cocaine trafficking syndicate run out of the Venezuelan military.\n\nLeftist mobs destroyed significant portions of Ecuador\u2019s capital, Quito, and its largest city Guayaquil this month after President Len\u00edn Moreno announced an end to a decades-old gasoline subsidy in tandem with his country departing the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC), which would repeal oil production limits and bring prices down naturally. Organizations identifying as leftist groups began building burning roadblocks and looting businesses throughout the country to pressure Moreno into relenting on the new policies, which he eventually did.\n\nSantiago, Chile, experienced similar leftist riots this weekend, this time against a proposed increase in subway fares. At least eight people have died since the protests began, most killed by smoke and fire within burning commerce buildings amid business lootings.\n\nCabello celebrated both instances of rioting, as well as the chaotic situations in Peru \u2013 where President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra dissolved the Congress last month \u2013 and Honduras, and the return of the far left in Argentina.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, Honduras is just a little breeze, and what is coming is a Bolivarian hurricane,\u201d he said, referring to the Venezuelan socialist ideology. \u201cWe are not isolated from the world \u2013 on the contrary, Venezuela every day is more consolidated.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was \u201chappy to see what is going on in [Latin] America, I am happy when I see the people wake up.\u201d\n\nCabello compared center-right Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era to dictator Augusto Pinochet for considering hiking subway fares and, later, using established curfew laws to keep leftist mobs from destroying the capital. He went on to predict that riots would soon hit Colombia because it, too, had a conservative president, Iv\u00e1n Duque.\n\n\u201cVenezuela is an authentic democracy,\u201d he concluded, \u201cwhere the people have the right to express themselves in elections and on the streets.\u201d\n\nThe Venezuelan military has killed hundreds of unarmed protesters since uprisings against Maduro began in 2014, many of them minors. Maduro is also still holding over 400 political prisoners, despite releasing about 12 of them in response to global criticism upon his regime \u2013 which does not legitimately govern Venezuela \u2013 being gifted a seat at the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nUltimately, Cabello predicted that the \u201cBolivarian breeze will reach the United States and it will have someone who governs for the people.\u201d\n\nMaduro endorsed his \u201crevolutionary friend\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMaduro himself also appeared to take credit for the leftist violence taking over Ecuador and Chile after Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court in exile accused the \u201cSao Paulo Forum,\u201d a term South Americans typically used to describe the coalition of radical leftists led by Cuba and including Venezuela and radical elements in Argentina, of orchestrating the riots.\n\n\u201cTo the Sao Paulo Forum I can tell you, from Venezuela, we are executing the plan, it is going how we planned it, it\u2019s going perfectly, you understand me,\u201d Maduro said on Sunday. \u201cTo the Sao Paulo Forum, the plan is going in full development, victorious. All the goals that we proposed in the Forum we are achieving one by one.\u201d\n\nMaduro appeared to be earnestly expressing that he believed the global left was succeeding, though he also attempted to present the Sao Paulo Forum as a conspiracy theory, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t say anything else, those are super mustache secrets, I can\u2019t say anything else.\u201d\n\nHe went on to call Ecuadorian President Moreno \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d to claim that Quito had evidence of leftist groups paying people to travel to Ecuador and riot. He blamed riots in Ecuador and Chile on \u201csavage capitalism.\u201d\n\nPi\u00f1era, in Chile, declared that the riots represented a \u201cwar\u201d that decent citizens must wage against violent rioters.\n\n\u201cWe are in a war against a powerful and implacable enemy that respects nothing and no one,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said.\n\nFollowing the beginning of the Ecuador riots, seven Latin American nations, including Chile, expressed support for Moreno and condemned the global left, and Maduro in particular, for organizing riots to hurt pro-democratic leaders in the region. The Organization of American States (OAS) also issued a statement of support.\n\nMaduro is a close ally of the wealthy Chinese communist regime, which has invested for months in delegitimizing peaceful protests against human rights abuses and authoritarianism in Hong Kong.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Diosdado Cabello, a U.S.-sanctioned drug trafficker, took credit for the violent riots in Ecuador and Chile this month.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1164734307-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
