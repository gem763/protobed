He was dragged down by angry commuters and had to be defended by London Underground staff and other passersby, the Guardian reported.\n\nAt Shadwell station, Phil Kingston, 83, glued himself to a train stopping traffic. \"I'm a Christian and that really upsets me to see God's creation being wrecked across the world,\" he said.\n\nExtinction Rebellion issued a statement saying that \"those that acted this morning planned their action autonomously,\" adding that \"Extinction Rebellion will be looking at ways to bring people together rather than create an unnecessary division.\"\n\nAuthorities on Monday issued a blanket ban on Extinction Rebellion protests in London. Green MEP Ellie Chowns was among those arrested on Monday in Trafalgar Square. She is challenging the ban in the High Court.\n\nAlthough supportive of the movement\u2019s aims, she told POLITICO: \"I personally don't support civil disobedience to block the tube because I see that public transport is part of the solution to the climate crisis, not part of the problem. And I would prefer to see protest targeted at the places that are really the causes of the problem.\"\n\nI strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protestors who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning.
