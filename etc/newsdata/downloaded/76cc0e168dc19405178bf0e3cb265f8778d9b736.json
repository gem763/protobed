When asked by a friend: 'When r u home? he responded: 'Soon hopefully.' It is thought the images were taken by other inmates using illegally acquired mobile phones.\n\nThe images emerged as Hannon was jailed for 42 months and White got 40 months after they admitted aggravated vehicle taking and causing grievous bodily harm.\n\nThe pair both from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, faced up to five years each in jail but were given lesser sentences after claiming to show 'remorse.'\n\nIn a statement their victim Lukasc Kapturewicz who is in his 30s said: 'I now have to be very careful with my head. Because of my head injury I cannot over exert myself. I cannot play with my children for long periods which really upsets me.\n\nUnderneath the picture, White said he'd be home 'soon hopefully'\n\n'I cannot work because of my finger injuries and I am fearful about my future and the chance I may lose my livelihood. I have had to start taking sleeping tablets to help me go to sleep because I am in a lot of pain.\n\n'I still have nightmares. I wake up sweating in the night. I am scared for my family that these men might show up at my house. They know where I work and I'm scared they could show up there. I am concerned for my family. The strain and stress this has caused my wife and my children. I don't understand why this happened to me.'\n\nMinshull Street Crown Court heard the theft of the Toyota Hilux van took place on February 6 after father of two Mr Kapturewicz parked it at his place of work in Rochdale.\n\nProsecutor Darren Preston said: 'A black car was seen to drive past the truck, turn around and return and pull up near it.\n\n'Two men got out of the car and got into the Toyota, before both cars drove off in convoy. Mr Kapturewicz and his employer tracked the vehicle through a tracking device and found that it was in traffic nearby.\n\n'They went to the vehicle and Mr Kapturewicz opened the passenger door and tried to get in but a scuffle broke out between him and the passenger, during which the car was driven down the road, and which ended as the passenger kicked at the victim's hands. Mr Kapturewicz was kicked physically out of the vehicle causing him to fall and hit his head on a parked car.\n\nHannon said he be 'soon home' on social media\n\n'The vehicle made off, leaving the complainant in the road. As he lay there, a witness in a following vehicle saw the car in front of her drive over his arm. The complainant was left with wounds to two fingers, a bruised wrist and scratches on his arm as well as a wound to the head, which bled. There was a fracture to the left side of the skull and a broken finger.'\n\nHannon was arrested after a shoe with his DNA on it was found at the scene of the incident. White was detained two months later.\n\nThe court heard Hannon also admitted unrelated offences of driving whilst disqualified and aggravated taking of a \u00a317,000 BMW 1 series car which later ploughed into a house forcing the homeowner to move out for a month whilst repairs were made. He has 16 offences on his criminal record including assault and dangerous driving.\n\nWhite also admitted theft of two other cars and a handling a stolen vehicle.. He has seven offences on his record including theft, dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking.\n\nIn mitigation Hannon's lawyer, Ian Roxborough, said: 'He has demonstrated remorse. There was a lack of motive in this. He accepts that for a period of time he has associated with negative influences which have brought him into this behaviour.\n\n'The GBH matter was not anticipated and he has a lot of regret about it. He realises the injuries caused.\n\n'He was immature at the time of this offence. He has had 9 months in custody to reflect. He is a different man to when I met him some time ago. Whilst in custody he has been completing a sport coaching course and handed me his certificate this morning.\n\n'His hope is that once this is behind him he can complete the second part of the course which must be done outside custody and then to go on to become a football coach.'\n\nWhite's lawyer, Amos Waldman, said: 'He demonstrated a lack of maturity at the time. His intention was not to cause injury but to get away from the scene. He is still young and his guilty plea is an indication of his remorse.'\n\nHannon and White were also each disqualified from driving for 30 months. Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Paul Reid QC said: 'This was a very nasty experience for the victim in this case.'", "description": "Jamie Hannon and Daniel White, both of whom are from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, posted pictures on social media saying that they'd soon be home as they awaited trial.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/21/19411170-0-image-a-38_1570478629207.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
