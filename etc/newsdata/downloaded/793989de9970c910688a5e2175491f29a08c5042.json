REUTERS/Lincoln Feast\n\nChina claims Taiwan as its territory, and says the democratic island has no right to formal ties with any country.\n\nThe Kiribati president\u2019s office and China\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes days after the Solomon Islands cut off ties with Taipei and deals a fresh blow to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January.\n\nTaiwan has lost seven allies to China since she took office in 2016 amid criticism of her handling of relations with China.\n\nSince Tsai took office, China has increased pressure on Taiwan, including with regular Chinese bomber patrols around the island. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan\u2019s formal independence, a red line for Beijing.\n\nTaiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters in Taipei that Taiwan had terminated diplomatic ties with Kiribati and will immediately close down its embassy there.\n\n\u201cAccording to information obtained by Taiwan, the Chinese government has already promised to provide full funds for the procurement of several airplanes and commercial ferries, thus luring Kiribati into switching diplomatic relations,\u201d Wu said.\n\nWu said China is trying to \u201csuppress and reduce Taiwan\u2019s international presence\u201d and \u201cultimately destroy Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Taiwan cuts ties with Kiribati amid China tension\n\n\u201cIt is blatantly obvious that the Chinese government, by creating these diplomatic incidents, seeks to manipulate public opinion in Taiwan, influence Taiwan\u2019s upcoming presidential and legislative elections, and undermine its democratic processes.\u201d\n\nKiribati is the seventh country to drop Taiwan as a diplomatic ally since 2016, following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, El Salvador and the Solomon Islands.\n\nTaiwan now has formal relations with only 15 countries worldwide.", "description": "Taiwan said on Friday it has cut official ties with the Pacific island nation of Kiribati, losing another ally amid Chinese pressure on nations with diplomatic relations with the self-ruled island.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431889596&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0EC", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
