Joni Ernst (R-IA) in a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\n\n\u201cIt was very successful,\u201d said Ernst of the mission to eliminate Islamic terrorist al-Baghdadi. \u201cOur U.S. special operations forces are absolutely the best in the world, and kudos to them. They are given a task, and they will not let us down. We know that for certain, and we saw that in this instance with the death of al-Baghdadi.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nErnst continued, \u201cUnder the direction of President Trump, the mission was carried out successfully. They took out the head of ISIS, but what we need to keep in mind is that there are others that will be stepping up to take al-Baghdadi\u2019s place. We\u2019ve already seen that. We\u2019ll continue to eliminate those leaders as we can, but it is vital that we continue to keep ISIS down. We cannot let them regroup. We cannot let them build another caliphate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw this when we left Iraq \u2026 during the Obama administration,\u201d added Ernst. \u201cWe saw the birth and development of ISIS and it really spurred me into Congress. I couldn\u2019t believe that we had held territory and gave it up to such a violent extremist group. We certainly don\u2019t want to see that again.\u201d\n\nErnst described the killing of al-Baghdadi as dissuasive toward Islamic terrorist recruitment.\n\n\u201cThis mission was an important reminder and a much needed step toward ensuring the enduring defeat of ISIS,\u201d Ernst determined. \u201cWe have got to continue down that path, and we\u2019ve got to let this serve as a reminder to other terrorist groups of what they can expect if they plan to group and build and organize like ISIS.\u201d\n\nErnst stated, \u201cThis will hopefully slow down their recruiting, letting them know that they will come and meet a violent end if they join this organization. We will persevere. The United States will persevere. So let that be a warning, the death of al-Baghdadi, let that be a warning to anyone that comes forward and supports these terrorist groups, these extremist groups, it will be the end. So I think we have a very good start here. We have destroyed the physical caliphate, but we have to continue picking off these individual leaders.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "The killing of ISIS leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a \"reminder\" that terrorists \"will meet a violent end,\" said Joni Ernst on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Joni-Ernst-teeth-grit-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
