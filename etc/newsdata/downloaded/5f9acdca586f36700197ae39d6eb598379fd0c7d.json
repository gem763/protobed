Gavin Newsom \u2014 her failure to snag the endorsement of Feinstein, who's been a fixture in the state's politics for generations, is seen by many as another blow to her 2020 campaign, which has lagged in recent polls.\n\nStill, in California, where many have long viewed the two as having an uneasy relationship, few were surprised \u2014 especially because Feinstein and her husband, Richard Blum, hosted Biden at a fundraiser in their home last week.\n\n\u201cDianne has known Joe longer than Kamala\u2019s been alive,\u2019\u2019 one high-profile Democratic strategist who knows both said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHarris\u2019 team, including her longtime adviser Debbie Mesloh, downplayed the differences and said the two share much common ground, having \u201cworked together over the years on issues that are important to Californians.\u201d\n\n\u201cKamala served as D.A. of Sen. Feinstein\u2019s hometown of San Francisco and was supported by the senator when she ran and won to be California\u2019s first female attorney general,\u2019\u2019 Mesloh told POLITICO. \u201cIn the Senate, they have worked together on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Barbara Boxer and Tom Steyer, a billionaire activist who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cThey served together for 15 years in the Senate, which is a very small, collegial body.\u2019\u2019\n\nFeinstein and Biden, who represented Delaware in the Senate, have worked side by side on key issues, and he was at her side in some of her toughest battles.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Feinstein got elected to the Senate and was facing a tough reelect, her assault-weapons ban got incorporated into Biden\u2019s crime bill \u2014 and they worked together on that,\u2019\u2019 Kapolczynski recalled. \u201cIt was one of her signature accomplishments and crucial to her politics.\u2019\u2019\n\nThrough the years, Feinstein and Biden \u2014 the key link to the Senate of President Barack Obama, whoregularly reached to the chamber \u2014 developed a political relationship \u201cthat is long and deep,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nStylistically, too, there\u2019s an affinity, Kapolczynski said: \u201cBoth Dianne and Joe are pragmatists. They want to hammer out the details, bring people together and get it done. \u2026 So it\u2019s very natural that she would choose Joe out of this field of candidates.\u2019\u2019\n\nPrivately, some California Democrats say there has long been a gulf between the 85-year-old Feinstein\u2019s formality and centrist politics and Harris, who at 54 is a generation younger.\n\nTheir political differences played out in the headlines early in Harris\u2019 career when, as San Francisco district attorney in 2004, Harris said she would not seek the death penalty for a gang member who fatally shot a 29-year-old police officer, Isaac Espinoza.\n\nFeinstein, addressing the congregation at St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral during Espinoza\u2019s memorial, delivered a veiled rebuke of that decision as Harris sat in the front row. \u201cThis is not only the definition of tragedy, it\u2019s the special circumstance called for by the death penalty law,\u201d Feinstein said, as officers filling the pews shouted their agreement.\n\nKapolczynski recalled the political shock waves of the day.\n\n\u201cIt was very unusual for a senator to publicly call on a local D.A. to change her position \u2014 and she refused,\u2019\u2019 Kapolczynski said. \u201cYou get the impression they never had much of a relationship.\u201d\n\nStill, others suggest the senior senator had hoped her daughter, Katherine Feinstein, who served as a presiding judge on the San Francisco Superior Court, might yearn for public office and someday run for the seat now held by Harris.\n\nIn 2016, asked about a possible Harris run, the elder Feinstein didn\u2019t mask her doubts or hide the distance between herself and an ambitious younger senator who had quickly garnered a national spotlight. While saying she was \u201ca big fan\u201d of Harris, Feinstein added, \u201cShe\u2019s brand-new here. \u2026 It takes a little time to get to know somebody.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Senate is a place that respects seniority, and that\u2019s built into all the rules and relationships,\u2019\u2019 Kapolczynski said. \u201cAnd every new senator is counseled to respect those traditions because you need the votes of everyone in that body to get things done.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor Feinstein, she said, there was likely some concern that \u201cHarris got elected and immediately started running for president.\u2019\u2019\n\nWade Randlett, a Silicon Valley supporter and fundraiser for Biden, said that with her endorsement, Feinstein issued her definitive message to Democrats regarding what she believes the party's most important mission in 2020 should be: beating President Donald Trump.\n\nFeinstein is the rare California Democrat, Randlett said, who \u2014 after being first elected in 1992, the \u201cYear of the Woman\u2019\u2019 \u2014 has remained popular with voters even in more conservative areas of the nation\u2019s most solidly blue state, like the Central Valley.\n\n\u201cShe understands how to win in those places,\u2019\u2019 Randlett said. \u201cThe moderate, non-college-educated, non-coastal Democrat \u2014 she has always been in touch with those voters. And that\u2019s why she understands that Joe is the candidate who will pull those independent voters in the Midwest and the Rust Belt into the Democratic column.\u2019\u2019", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/80/7f/4421a6124898ae1f7c1a55adb577/191009-kamala-harris-dianne-feinstein-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
