Tatum made two of his three free throws to force overtime.\n\nMiddleton was the Americans' leading scorer with 15 points on 5-of-9 shooting, and Ilyasova led all scorers with 23 points.\n\nTeam USA improved to 2-0 with the win, while Turkey fell to 1-1.\n\nWith 50 seconds remaining in overtime, Osman completed an old-fashioned three-point play to give Turkey a one-point lead. Dogus Balbay missed two free throws shortly thereafter, but since Brooklyn Nets guard Joe Harris was called for an unsportsmanlike foul, Turkey retained possession.\n\nOsman was fouled on the inbound play, but he missed both of his free throws as well, which left the door open for Team USA. Middleton was fouled on a drive to the basket with two seconds left and made both of his free throws, while Ilyasova missed an open three as time expired.\n\nTatum, who made a quality pass to Middleton before he was fouled, appeared to injure his ankle on the play and had to leave the game.\n\nWhile the Gregg Popovich-coached Americans showed great gumption and grit by hanging in there to pick up the win, Andy Larsen of the Salt Lake Tribune and Jason Patt of Clutch Points were two of many who chalked it up to Turkey choking the game away:\n\nTeam USA looked strong out of the gates with a 26-21 lead after the first quarter, and it carried that five-point lead into halftime. Turkey chipped away to make it a four-point deficit after three, and it outscored the United States 20-16 in the fourth to force overtime.\n\nWhile the Americans shot just 35 percent from the field and 35 percent from deep, they attempted 40 trifectas and made 14 of them. Of the 11 players who saw action Tuesday, eight of them made a three-pointer for Team USA.\n\nAlso, six players scored in double figures for the United States, as Celtics guard Kemba Walker (14 points), Tatum (11), Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner (11), Harris (11) and Sacramento Kings wing Harrison Barnes (10) joined Middleton in that regard.\n\nTurkey had five players score in double figures, but only seven players scored for the team overall, which underscored its lack of depth compared to Team USA.\n\nOsman and Philadelphia 76ers forward Furkan Korkmaz are Turkey's other two NBA players aside from Ilyasova, and they finished with 15 and 16 points, respectively.\n\nWith wins over Turkey and Czech Republic, the Americans are guaranteed a spot in the second round of the World Cup. They will look to close out Group E play with a perfect 3-0 record when they face 0-2 Japan on Thursday.\n\nTurkey will face 1-1 Czech Republic on Thursday, and while the winning team will advance, the loser will be eliminated.", "description": "The United States survived a tough challenge from Turkey to improve to 2-0 at the 2019 FIBA World Cup with a 93-92 overtime   victory Tuesday at Shanghai Oriental Sports Center in Shanghai, China...", "authors": ["Mike"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/327/hi-res-2b824cf51061bf08b7068634f6be896b_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75"}
