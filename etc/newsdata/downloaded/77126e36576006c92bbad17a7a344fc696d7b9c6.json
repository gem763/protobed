Stay up to date with us \u2014 reach out & sign up.\n\nEllen L. Weintraub chairs the U.S. Federal Election Commission. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for PEN America)\n\nIn the Agencies\n\n'TIP OF THE ICEBERG': It's a particularly busy time for the Federal Election Commission to be out of commission.\n\nFEC Chair Ellen Weintraub says the charges against two associates of President Trump's personal lawyer for scheming to funnel foreign money to U.S. politicians are \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere may well be a lot of money that is slipping into our system that we just don\u2019t know about,\u201d Weintraub said in a Friday interview.\n\nAnd the question of whether Trump acted inappropriately by pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate 2020 political rival Joe Biden is at the core of the House's impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut the FEC is effectively paralyzed: The agency in charge of enforcing campaign finance laws has not been able to conduct any formal business since the departure of its Republican vice chair in August. It needs a quorum to function \u2014 and Trump has yet to appoint a fourth commissioner. Weintraub, a Democrat who has chaired the commission three times since her 2002 appointment by President George W. Bush, is very concerned \u2014 and says voters should be, too.\n\n\u201cWhen campaign finance issues are on the front pages of the newspaper every single day, this is a particularly bad time for the FEC not to have a quorum and not be able to respond to enforcement matters, not to be able to have new rulemaking or issue advisory opinions,\u201d she told us.\n\nBut Weintraub isn't going quietly. She won't comment on the specifics of the case against Lev Parnas or Igor Fruman, who also assisted in Rudolph W. Giuliani's shadow agenda on behalf of the president in Ukraine, but she stressed that \u201cthe ban on foreign money, obviously, is needed to make sure we have American elections for Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Russia connection: It remains a mystery where Parnas and Fruman got their money, our colleagues Roz Helderman, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne, and Tom Hamburger report. But \u201cprosecutors alleged that Parnas and Fruman were backed in part by an unnamed Russian national who used them to funnel donations to state and federal candidates.\u201d\n\nIt remains a mystery where Parnas and Fruman got their money, our colleagues Roz Helderman, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne, and Tom Hamburger report. But \u201cprosecutors alleged that Parnas and Fruman were backed in part by an unnamed Russian national who used them to funnel donations to state and federal candidates.\u201d Parnas and Fruman were active GOP donors: \u201cAt least 14 Republican candidates and groups directly received a total of $675,500 in campaign contributions last year \u2026 from the Soviet-born Florida business executives, per the Wall Street Journal's Julie Bykowicz.\n\n\u201cAt least 14 Republican candidates and groups directly received a total of $675,500 in campaign contributions last year \u2026 from the Soviet-born Florida business executives, per the Wall Street Journal's Julie Bykowicz. And six of their donations, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, involved \u201ceither a shell company used to hide the men\u2019s identities or foreign money meant to curry favor with U.S. politicians.\u201d This total includes the $325,000 a pro-Trump super PAC received from the pair's company, Global Energy Producers.\n\nThis total includes the $325,000 a pro-Trump super PAC received from the pair's company, Global Energy Producers. Why this matters: \u201cEvery single one of these contributions is suspect because they were made with an ulterior motive,\u201d Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, told the Journal.\n\nWeintraub slammed the idea of straw donors: \u201cThe ban on contributions in the name of another \u2026 is at the core of the FEC\u2019s mission to ensure that the voters are informed about where the money is coming from and where it\u2019s going and who politicians are indebted to.\u201d\n\nValue in transparency: \u201cIf we have people giving in other people\u2019s names then we lose that valuable information about who is the true source of the money,\u201d she added.\n\nWeintraub also refused to answer whether Trump's calls for governments to investigate Biden actually broke any rules: \u201cI\u2019d rather not answer that question because it\u2019s too close to the facts of an actual thing that could come before the commission in an enforcement context,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she says the laws surrounding foreign national cases are clear: \u201cIt is certainly illegal to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,\u201d Weintraub told us. \u201cThat\u2019s just black letter law.\u201d\n\nI will not be silenced.\n\n\n\nThe independence of the United States Federal Election Commission will not be compromised.\n\n\n\n/1 pic.twitter.com/T5XfjvQWNw \u2014 Ellen L Weintraub (@EllenLWeintraub) October 10, 2019\n\nThe FEC chair had sharp words for Republicans lawmakers: Last week, the ranking Republican on the House Administration Committee requested an ethics investigation into Weintraub. Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) who was named honorary state chair for Trump's reelection campaign earlier this month, accused her of using government time and resources for \u201cideological, and at times political, purposes\u201d \u2014 and to disparage the president.\n\nWeintraub, who originally responded that she would \u201cnot be silenced,\u201d told Power Up: \u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable how these supposedly deregulatory advocates suddenly don't like it so much \u2014 free speech isn\u2019t so appealing when they don't like what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nWeintraub warned that the FEC will eventually be back in action \u2014 and no politicians or would-be campaign violators should feel secure in the lull of enforcement power: \u201cThere is a five year statute of limitations so people should not think they can get away with everything,\u201d Weintraub said.\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

(Lefteris Pitarakis/AP)\n\nGlobal Power\n\nTHE LATEST ON SYRIA: America\u2019s policy for Syria and the region is in upheaval, our colleagues Karen DeYoung, Dan Lamothe, Missy Ryan and Kareem Fahim report.\n\nOver the weekend: Cabinet secretaries denied that Trump's decision to withdraw all 1,000 troops from northern Syria meant the U.S. \"had 'abandoned' its Syrian Kurdish allies to invading Turkish forces and threatened severe sanctions against Ankara.\"\n\nKey quote: \u201cWe obviously could not continue,\u201d a senior administration official told our colleagues, who called the situation \u201ca total s---storm.\u201d\n\nOn the ground: \u201cThis is total chaos,\u201d per the official. Turkey \"gave guarantees\" to the U.S. that its forces would not be harmed, the official said, but noted Syrian militias allied with them \"are running up and down roads, ambushing and attacking vehicles.\" This, per our colleagues, is \"putting American \u00adforces \u2014 as well as civilians \u2014 in danger even as they withdraw. The militias, known as the Free Syrian Army, 'are crazy and not reliable.' At the same time, the official said, the Islamic State is active in the area, and there are reports that Russian and Syrian forces are moving in as well.\"\n\nAnd the Kurds strike a deal: Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. concluded that they could no longer count on U.S. forces and needed to reach a pact with the Iran- and Russia-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe deal that the Syrian Democratic forces made \u201cwill bring forces loyal to Assad back into towns and cities that have been under Kurdish control for seven years,\" our colleagues Liz Sly, Louisa Loveluck, Asser Khattab and Sarah Dadouch write .\n\nBackground: \u201cThe deal followed three days of negotiations brokered by Russia between the Syrian government and the SDF, which had reached the conclusion that it could no longer count on the United States, its chief ally for the past five years in the fight against the Islamic State, according to a Kurdish intelligence official.\"\n\nWhat this means for ISIS: \u201cThe fighting has raised concerns that Islamist militants detained in the battle to defeat ISIS could escape, facilitating the reconstitution of the Islamic State,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Ben Hubbard, Charlie Savage, Eric Schmitt and Patrick Kingsley report. \u201cAs American troops were redeployed, two American officials said the United States had failed to transfer five dozen 'high value' Islamic State detainees out of the country,\u201d per the Times.\n\nWe don't know how many escaped: \u201cOne official said that multiple Kurdish-run detention facilities were now unguarded and that the U.S. military believed hundreds of detainees had escaped,\u201d our colleagues Karen, Dan, Missy and Kareem report. The Times cites U.S. officials as saying that the Kurds refused to let the retreating U.S. forces take any more ISIS detainees from their makeshift prisons.\n\n\u201cOne official said that multiple Kurdish-run detention facilities were now unguarded and that the U.S. military believed hundreds of detainees had escaped,\u201d our colleagues Karen, Dan, Missy and Kareem report. The Times cites U.S. officials as saying that the Kurds refused to let the retreating U.S. forces take any more ISIS detainees from their makeshift prisons. But it's too early to tell whether ISIS will be resurgent, according to The Times. \u201cThe likelihood ... remains hard to gauge, since the Syrian Kurdish leadership may have exaggerated some incidents to catch the West\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nA US soldier sits atop an armored vehicle during a demonstration by Syrian Kurds earlier this month.

But actually, we were preventing an endless war,\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran said on CBS's Face the Nation. He added that \u201cfor me \u2014 as a guy that served in the military and really got into politics because I believe in the role America plays \u2014 to see this yet again, you know, leaving an ally behind \u2026 is disheartening, depressing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear the president and people like Rand Paul talk about endless wars all the time, and it\u2019s kitschy.

Key players including Vice President Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the Defense Department and the White House are facing deadlines to turn over documents and information.\n\nBut it remains to be seen just how much \u2014 if anything \u2014 the administration will turn over given the White House's stated \u201cfull halt\u201d on cooperation with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAs always, we check in on our colleagues' helpful calendar on what you need to look out for:\n\nHappening today: Fiona Hill is on the Hill.\n\nWhat you need to know: Hill is expected to tell lawmakers that European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland and Giuliani \"circumvented the National Security Council and the normal White House process to pursue a shadow policy on Ukraine,\" NBC News's Josh Lederman, Carol E. Lee and Kristen Welker reported last week.\n\nA Giuliani associate is also expected to testify: Semyon \u201cSam\u201d Kislin, a Ukrainian-born businessman, is also scheduled to be deposed by lawmakers. BuzzFeed's Michael Sallah, Tanya Kozyreva and Aubrey Belford reported. Kislin served on a business advisory council for then-Mayor Giuliani.\n\nLater this week: Sondland will testify it was Trump who told him there was no \"quid pro quo.\" Sondland \"intends to tell Congress this week that the content of a text message he wrote denying a quid pro quo with Ukraine was relayed to him directly by [Trump] in a phone call, according to a person familiar with his testimony,\" our colleagues Aaron C. Davis and John Hudson scooped over the weekend.\n\nSondland will tell House investigators Thursday he doesn't know if Trump was telling the truth: \"It\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u201d said the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters. \"The call lasted less than five minutes, and Trump appeared to be in a foul mood, according to the person, who spoke to The Post with Sondland\u2019s permission, an intermediary said,\" our colleagues write.\n\nThe ambassador will also offer an alternative theory: A scenario where Trump ditches the scheme amid mounting pressure to release the $400 million in security assistance.\n\nAnd Adam Schiff indicates the whistleblower may not testify at all: The House Intelligence Committee chairman said \"that protecting the identity of the whistleblower who raised the alarm about President Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine is 'our primary interest,' in a sign that House Democrats may not press the individual to testify before Congress,\" our colleague Felicia reports.\n\nIn the Media\n\nVIDEO OF FAKE JOURNALIST SHOOTING SHOWN AT TRUMP RESORT: \"A video depicting a macabre scene of a fake President Trump shooting, stabbing and brutally assaulting members of the news media and his political opponents was shown at a conference for his supporters at his Miami resort last week, according to footage obtained by The New York Times,\" the Times's Michael S.
