They\u2019d eat him alive. Unless, of course, he did nothing to block their agenda, in which case he\u2019d be left alone like all the other cowardly roll-over Republicans.\n\nThe American people chose a barbarian for president because they knew only a barbarian could drain the Washington swamp.\n\nAnd, judging by the president\u2019s unchanged approval ratings since House Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry, not to mention his record donation take on the back of it, Trump fans are with him for the long haul, no matter how boorishly he behaves.\n\nThey see him implementing his agenda against all odds. If the swamp gets in his way, Trump bulldozes over it. Supreme Court, tick. Taxes cut, tick. Regulations slashed, tick. Jobs up, tick. Military rebuilt, tick. ISIS stopped, tick. Globalism challenged, tick. Paris climate treaty scrapped, tick. Borders strengthened, tick. Wall built, half-tick.", "description": "", "authors": ["Miranda Devine", "Nypost.Com Devine-Donald-Trumps-Lesson-For-Mitt-Romney"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
