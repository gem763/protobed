Should he, or any future president, attempt to violate the Constitution in such a way, First Liberty will once again be first in the fight to defend religious freedom.\u201d\n\nHeaven forbid that day comes to America. But I can assure you it'll be a cold day south of Satan's house before any evangelical church or university will renounce their religious beliefs and bow down to the militant LGBT agenda.", "description": "There should be no doubt that Democrats and a militant .10/11/2019 15:35:01PM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/263/306a19ff-b5e0-48fd-aefa-3be0177fc5f3.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
