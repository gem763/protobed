The eighth-seeded Williams has reached three major finals since having a baby but lost them all. Two were at Wimbledon and the other last year at the U.S. Open against Naomi Osaka, which quickly devolved after Williams argued with chair umpire Carlos Ramos about a warning over receiving coaching signals. If she wins this championship, 20 years after she won her first of six titles at Flushing Meadows, the 37-year-old Williams would equal Margaret Court\u2019s record for most Grand Slam titles. A year after losing in U.S. Open qualifying, Andreescu is the first teenager in the U.S. Open final since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009. She won her first two career titles this year at Indian Wells and Toronto, the latter when Williams had to stop playing in the final because of back spasms. Andreescu is 33-4 this season.\n\nSATURDAY\u2019S FORECAST\n\nMostly sunny High of 77 degrees (25 C).\n\nFRIDAY\u2019S WEATHER\n\nShowers.
