I\u2019m not saying everything he\u2019s saying is wrong, but you are going to say it? You, as Kanye West, are going to talk s--- about other rappers talking about buying \u2018foreign\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, as Kanye West? I know Spike Lee\u2019s gonna kill me, but let me finish. I\u2019d rather buy 80 gold chains and go [ignorant],\u201d Noah continued, quoting Kanye\u2019s verse in \u201cClique.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Kanye West?

So you\u2019re saying that every black person in America is brainwashed? You\u2019re saying that 70, 80, 90 percent of black people who are voting Democrat, they\u2019re brainwashed?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re the only person who\u2019s enlightened and all these black people are stupidly following this Democratic-victim [narrative]?\u201d\n\nNoah questioned the likelihood of all African-Americans being brainwashed and brought up the two-party system in America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWhat is more likely? The fact that these people are brainwashed, or the fact that, in America, you have to vote for the system that gives you the best chance?\" he asked. \"You only have two choices\u2026 if you are a black person you go, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to vote for the choice that gives me the best chance of success.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know who doesn\u2019t mess around with their votes in America? Black women. They don\u2019t. They do not. And I refuse to live in a world where I go, \u2018Black women have been brainwashed.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t think black women in America have been \u2014 or can be \u2014 brainwashed. I think, if anything, black women in America have the least leeway when it comes to messing around with their vote,\u201d Noah further added.", "description": "Trevor Noah had a lot to say to\u00a0Kanye West following the \u201cJesus Is King\u201d rapper\u2019s criticism of hip-hop culture and saying that\u00a0Democrats are effectively forcing black Americans to\u00a0abort\u00a0their children.", "authors": ["Andy Sahadeo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/trevor-noah-kanye-west.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
