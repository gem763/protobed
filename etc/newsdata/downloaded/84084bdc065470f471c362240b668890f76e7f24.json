Hudgins told police the other men fled, and authorities have not been able to locate them.\n\nAD\n\nAs Americans debate gun-control efforts after recent mass shootings in El Paso and Odessa, Tex., gun rights advocates have pointed to Hudgins\u2019s story to emphasize their argument that guns are necessary for self-defense.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was all I had in my gun. I shot until I couldn\u2019t shoot anymore,\u201d Hudgins said. \u201cI saved my life.\u201d\n\nOfficers responding to the shooting found a male juvenile with gunshot wounds, police said. He was taken to a hospital, according to Smith, and his condition prevents him from speaking with investigators.\n\nThe Houston district attorney declined to charge Hudgins in the incident, Smith said. Texas requires a license to carry handguns in public, though they are not permitted in places such as airports. Texas also has a \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, known as its \u201cCastle Doctrine,\u201d which allows people to use deadly force to defend themselves under certain circumstances.\n\nAD\n\nThe juvenile who was shot has not yet been charged, Smith said, because \u201cit\u2019s possible that the individual who was shot may be the suspect, but that hasn\u2019t been definitely determined yet.\u201d Smith could not confirm surveillance video existed but said authorities would examine footage if it was available.\n\nAD\n\nHudgins\u2019s story drew national attention Tuesday and Wednesday after the National Rifle Association retweeted ABC 13\u2032s interview with her. Houston congressman Dan Crenshaw (R) used the story to argue against universal background checks, tweeting that under such legislation he couldn\u2019t let friends borrow his handgun.\n\nSituations like this story are why we protect the 2nd Amendment.\n\n\n\nSide note: With universal background checks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to let my friends borrow my handgun when they travel alone like this. We would make felons out of people just for defending themselves. https://t.co/x60mdd1WW1 \u2014 Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) September 4, 2019\n\nHis tweet drew criticism from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who said that lending guns to people could lead to potential domestic abusers obtaining firearms.\n\nAD\n\nTexas has suffered two high-profile mass shootings this summer. In early August, a gunman killed 22 people at an El Paso Walmart as families shopped for school supplies. Among the dead were Jordan and Andre Anchondo, who authorities say died while shielding their baby from the bullets. Over Labor Day weekend, an attempted traffic stop led to an unexpected barrage of gunfire from the driver that left seven people dead and more than 20 people wounded in Odessa and Midlands, authorities said.\n\nOne day later, on Sunday, several new gun laws went into effect in Texas that affirmed or enhanced its residents\u2019 rights to keep and carry firearms.\n\nRead more:\n\nSan Francisco just passed a resolution calling the NRA a \u2018domestic terrorist organization\u2019\n\nTexas, reeling after El Paso shooting, is about to loosen gun laws\n\nAD", "description": "Lachelle Hudgins told police that five or six men approached her car and that one tried to grab her purse before she fired.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rnfS9TJCcF0uTDUmyMnV799P-UQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I5VI73TMBQI6PK54UU2IAZZCQY.jpg"}
