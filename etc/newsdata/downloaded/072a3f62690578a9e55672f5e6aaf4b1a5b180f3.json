David Petraeus [Ret.] said the symbolism of hosting Taliban officials at the Camp David presidential retreat would've been troubling -- but that President Trump made the right call in the end.\n\nThe president was right to call off the summit at the compound in the mountains near Thurmont, Md., especially given the fact the U.S. is very close to remembering the 18th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks, Petraeus said Monday on \"The Story.\"\n\n\"I think the symbolism of that [meeting] would've been a bit troubling,\" he said.\n\nPETRAEUS PRAISES TRUMP, CALLS OUT NATO, NORTH KOREA AND CHINA\n\n\"Remember, that was where the decision was made to invade Taliban in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.
