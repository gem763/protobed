The company received a further 3,000 complaints in the first half of this year.\n\nSean Moran, partner and insolvency specialist at the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, said payday lenders have been under huge pressure from stricter rules brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority that capped the total amount of charges and interest payable on loans.\n\n\u201cA lot of these companies ruthlessly target young men and women,\u201d Mr Moran said. \u201cThe significant rise in personal insolvency rates for the under-25s is of grave concern \u2013 they now make up 6.5 per cent of all personal insolvencies in the UK.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
