Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the inquiry chairman, found the London fire brigade\u2019s readiness was \u201cgravely inadequate\u201d and fewer people would have died if it had been better prepared.\n\nBut Wrack told the BBC that the inquiry was \u201cback to front\u201d and should have first assessed why the building was covered in combustible cladding and scrutinised government policy on fire safety, including ministers\u2019 response to the fatal cladding fire at Lakanal House in Southwark in 2009.\n\nHe said the cladding was \u201ca key issue and yet it is not seriously being addressed. The firefighters turned up after that happened, after the building had already been turned, in reality, into a deathtrap.\n\nGrenfell survivors fear inquiry judge will side with establishment Read more\n\n\u201cWhy is nobody holding to account the fire minister or the prime minister, who was previously in charge of the London fire brigade himself?\u201d he asked.\n\nJohnson is expected to make a statement in the Commons on the inquiry\u2019s findings on Wednesday. While he was mayor of London he oversaw the LFB as it was required to make gross savings of more than \u00a3100m, partly as a result of cuts to central government grant. This involved cutting fire appliances by 27, closing 10 fire stations and cutting 552 firefighters and 324 support staff posts.\n\nThe report includes only the conclusions to the first phase of the inquiry. Hearings for the second phase examining events and decisions leading up to the fire will begin early in the new year. Moore-Bick said in this week\u2019s report that he would go on to \u201cscrutinise those who are responsible at the highest level for [the LFB\u2019s] operations\u201d.\n\nWrack\u2019s comments came after the report leaked on Monday night. Copies had been distributed earlier in the day to hundreds of core participants in the inquiry, including survivors, bereaved relatives, the LFB, builders and materials manufacturers.\n\nWhy is no one holding to account the fire minister or prime minister, who was previously in charge of the fire brigade? Matt Wrack\n\nIt found that people died because the \u201cstay put\u201d policy, which recommends that residents are safer in their flats than trying to escape, was not lifted earlier, LFB \u201cpersonnel and systems were overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster\u201d, 999 call handlers sometimes refused to believe desperate victims and the \u00a310m refurbishment of the block between 2014 and 2016 by its owner, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, breached building regulations.\n\nRecipients were required to sign non-disclosure agreements ahead of the planned publication at 10am on Wednesday. Some have voiced frustration that they are not able to comment despite the contents of the report being widely reported.\n\nGrenfell United, which represents hundreds of bereaved relatives and survivors, said it was \u201cdisappointed that the dignity of the bereaved and survivors has not been respected\u201d and said it would respond after formal publication.\n\nTwo years after Grenfell, why are thousands still not safe in their homes? | Seraphima Kennedy Read more\n\n\u201cWe are determined that those at the heart of the inquiry are not sidelined and that the views of the Grenfell community are kept at the forefront of the inquiry,\u201d it said.\n\nAndrew Dismore, chairman of the London assembly fire, resilience and emergency planning committee, said: \u201cCriticism of any individual firefighter\u2019s actions on the night risks losing the focus on the fact that they should never have been faced with that situation. The brigade\u2019s areas of improvement are well documented.\n\n\u201cWhat appears new in the leaks today is the inquiry\u2019s findings that the cladding was non-compliant. We know that the release of this report will be harrowing for the bereaved, survivors and relatives, as well as firefighters involved on that night, and we encourage anyone who needs it to reach out to dedicated welfare services.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Fire chief says inquiry should have centred on cladding and government policy", "authors": ["Robert Booth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d56c30e6b29ad21623561190dcfb4c114796cc35/0_211_6377_3828/master/6377.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a612a8041b5a59fa7b663e67c9cb536c", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
