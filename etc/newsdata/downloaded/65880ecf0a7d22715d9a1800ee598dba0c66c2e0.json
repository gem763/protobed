We have simply got to stop us leaving without a deal,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrent plans call for Britain to leave the EU by Oct. 31 unless Britain formally asks for its third extension and each of the bloc\u2019s other 27 nations agree. Brexit first was set for March 29.\n\nA senior Cabinet minister overseeing preparations for leaving with no EU withdrawal agreement declined to say if Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government would abide by Parliament\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what the legislation says,\u201d Michael Gove, a staunch Brexit advocate, said.\n\nGove\u2019s refusal to commit to following Parliament\u2019s sets up a possible constitutional clash over Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union to make good on the results of a 2016 referendum.\n\nJohnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU on that day even if there is no deal in place, despite economists warning his determination could have severe costs.\n\nThe battleground shifts to Parliament when it returns from a lengthy summer recess Tuesday. It was not clear how many members of Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party might break with the prime minister over a possible \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit.\n\nJohnson has made plans to shut Parliament for part of the period before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. The move would shorten the time his opponents have to try to take control of the Brexit process.\n\nJohnson and his top advisers are planning to meet with recalcitrant legislators from his own Conservative Party to try to keep them from supporting the opposition\u2019s efforts to prevent \u201cno-deal.\u201d\n\nEU officials have said they are ready for a \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario if necessary.\n\nGermany\u2019s foreign minister said in a newspaper interview published Sunday that an orderly withdrawal remains the best option for both sides.\n\nBut Heiko Maas told the Funke newspaper that \u201cin case a hard Brexit turns out to be unavoidable, Germany is prepared for this scenario.\u201d", "description": "The U.K. Labour Party\u2019s chief Brexit adviser says opposition plans to block a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit would require postponing the country\u2019s departure deadline...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP830_boris__ZG_20190821054807.jpg"}
