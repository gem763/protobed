(Getty Images)\n\nDuring the 2016 referendum, Leave campaigners claimed that Brexit would mean a weekly EU payment of \u00a3350 million could be spent on Britain's health care instead. The claim, printed on the side of a bus that shuttled campaigners around the country, was later acknowledged as false.\n\nOn Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ruled out any delay to Britain's departure from the EU on Oct. 31. He warned political rivals that if there was an attempt to block a no-deal exit, he could call an election as early as Oct. 14.\n\nOn Tuesday, Conservative MP Phillip Lee defected to the Liberal Democrats, ending the Conservative Party's working majority and leaving Johnson presiding over a minority government.\n\nBoris Johnson has ruled out ever asking the European Union to delay Britain's departure from the bloc, making an implicit warning that he would be forced to call an election if British lawmakers tied his hands on Brexit. 2:02\n\nBourchier has voted Conservative in every election since he was eligible to vote, but gave up his membership following the prime minister's decision to prorogue Parliament.\n\n\"The mess the country is in is because of Boris Johnson primarily. Throughout the referendum, he lied, and he's lying again now,\" Bouchier said.\n\nBut Conservative voter John May said it's \"a very empty argument\" to suggest that \"all those 17.4 million people were hoodwinked by liars, whereas the 16.2 million people who voted to remain knew exactly what they were doing.\"\n\nPro-Brexit May said he found it insulting that Leave voters \"were stupid or misled.\"\n\n\"That is one of the main reasons we did vote to leave, was because we were sick and tired of being told by people that they knew better when it came to Europe.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
