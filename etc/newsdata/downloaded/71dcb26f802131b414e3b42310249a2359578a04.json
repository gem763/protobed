He won\u2019t be really done until he starts slipping with black voters. But a man whose advantage depends on electability, and whose electability depends in part on his polling lead, can\u2019t sustain discouraging polls as easily as other candidates can. If Warren beats him up tomorrow night and a flurry of polls issue next week showing her surging ahead, I\u2019m not sure Grandpa Joe ever quite regains altitude.\n\nIt should be noted upfront that YouGov\u2019s polling typically has worse numbers for Biden than other pollsters do, for whatever reason. Twenty-six percent in today\u2019s survey is actually a good showing for him there even though he\u2019s at 28 percent or better in most other polls. But it should also be noted that Warren\u2019s 26 percent share of the vote here, tying Biden for first, is the single best national poll she\u2019s ever had. Ever. Only once before had she ever been north of 22 percent. The fact that she\u2019s now in uncharted territory makes this a big deal.\n\nAmong likely voters (IE: people who say they\u2019re going to vote in the primary) who are also registered to vote: Warren: 26\n\nBiden: 26\n\nSanders: 16\n\nHarris: 6\n\nButtigieg: 6\n\nYang: 2\n\nBooker: 2\n\nO\u2019Rourke: 1\n\nKlobuchar: 1\n\nGabbard: 1\n\nCastro: 1\n\nBennet: 1\n\nBullock: 1\n\nWilliamson: 1 \u2014 G. Elliott Morris (@gelliottmorris) September 11, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s not the only discouraging poll for him out today. A new one out of New Hampshire has him trailing Bernie Sanders by eight(!). And although CNN still has him ahead of Warren nationally, 24/18, that\u2019s a five-point slide for him and a four-point gain for her since last month. His electability advantage isn\u2019t as strong either:\n\nThe reason he\u2019s still holding on overall is because he enjoys a huge 30-point lead among black Democrats. Which makes tomorrow night doubly dangerous for him: Even if Warren doesn\u2019t damage him, a strong showing by Kamala Harris or Cory Booker that knocks him back among black voters could be enough to send him tumbling behind Warren.\n\nI wonder what Team Warren is hoping black voters do. Obviously she\u2019d like to win their support, but if this ends up a three-way race for black Dems between Biden, Harris, and Booker before Iowa, if I\u2019m Warren I think I\u2019d prefer for those voters to stick with Grandpa Joe. Simple reason: He\u2019s a soft frontrunner and Harris or Booker could be formidable if they built momentum. Plus, there are few black voters in Iowa and New Hampshire so Biden won\u2019t benefit from their support in the early states. If they stick with Joe, Harris and Booker will be sidelined; then Warren can try to beat him in Iowa and New Hampshire, taking control of the presidential race, and hope that black voters in South Carolina race to embrace her in South Carolina as the new presumptive favorite for the nomination.\n\nThere is some good polling news for Biden today, though. This number from CNN\u2019s data stands out:\n\nOn a gut-check vote for Democrats between the centrist Biden and the progressive warriors Warren or Sanders, Joe has the advantage. Rank-and-file Dems are more moderate on average than their noisy online progressive colleagues.\n\nThis result from ABC/WaPo\u2019s new survey is also good for him, to put it mildly:\n\nThe president saw that number this morning and didn\u2019t react well. Biden\u2019s Democratic competition would point out that all of them are leading Trump head to head in this poll, and by sizable margins: Bernie\u2019s ahead 52/43, Warren\u2019s up 51/44, even Harris and Buttigieg are in front albeit more modestly. But Dems obviously will want to play their strongest hand against Trump next fall and head-to-head polling consistently shows that hand is Biden. I wonder, in fact, if it will put him over the top in the early states if hypothetical match-ups like this showing him with gargantuan leads over POTUS are still coming out in January of next year. It\u2019s his ultimate \u201celectability\u201d card, even if his lead over Sanders and Warren begins to slip.\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, I leave you with this from YouGov\u2019s data guy.
