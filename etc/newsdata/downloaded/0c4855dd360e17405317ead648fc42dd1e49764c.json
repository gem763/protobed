A student protester was shot in the chest and police had acid thrown on them.\n\nWe followed a group of protesters for five hours in the twin districts of Wong Tai Sin and Diamond Hill, traveling with them from a hidden overpass to watching them snuff out tear gas canisters from the police.\n\nHere is what we saw.\n\nWe started at 2:10 p.m. near Hammer Hill Sports Ground near the Wong Tai Sin district in Kowloon, home to many public housing estates where many protesters in the group live.\n\ncaption An aerial view of Hammer Hill Sports Ground in Hong Kong. source Google Maps\n\nWong Tai Sin used to be a stronghold of Beijing-aligned political parties, such as the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, multiple reports of the heavy-handed tactics of the Hong Kong police against the protesters this summer have turned many people in the district against the police and Beijing, and toward the protesters.\n\nNone of them were willing to identify themselves. Bob*, a 19-year-old nursing student, joked: \u201cChina calls us \u2018rioters.\u2019 That is what you can call us.\u201d He is wearing a helmet saying \u201cKeep calm and march on\u201d topped with a yellow umbrella \u2014 the symbol of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes\n\nBob, like many protesters, has a specific job.\n\nHe is a \u201cfrontliner\u201d \u2013 someone who comes face-to-face with police \u2013 and his role is to snuff out tear gas canisters by stuffing them into an watertight bag filled with wet towels.\n\n*Bob is not this protester\u2019s real name.\n\nOur route to the protest site didn\u2019t appear well planned, however. At 2:35 p.m. they were hiding on top of an overpass near Choi Hung Estate, a public housing complex, trying to figure out where to find other protesters.\n\ncaption Map showing the approximate location of the overpass near Hammer Hill Sports Ground and Choi Hung Estate, on which protesters hid from police. source Google Maps/Insider\n\nThe top of the overpass gave the group a good view of approaching police while being shielded by nearby roads slopes, as well as provided various escape routes: a tunnel toward the Choi Hung Estate as well as one toward Hammer Hill.\n\nMoments later, a police car containing ordinary constables \u2014 as opposed to riot police \u2014 spotted the protesters and started crossing the road to reach us. We fled toward Nan Liang Garden, a park near the Chi Lin Nunnery, a Buddhist temple and famous tourist attraction.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nOne protester said moments before fleeing: \u201cThere is police at Wong Tai Sin, there are patrol cars in the estates, and police vans patrolling. We don\u2019t know what to do\u201d.\n\nWe eventually made it to a nearby street, where Indonesian domestic helpers were relaxing on their day off, oblivious to the panic around them. Moments after this photo was taken, someone yelled that tear gas was being shot nearby.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nThe helpers started running away with their belongings, while protesters remained in place to decide whether to stay to fight or flee.\n\nPolice had deployed tear gas in the Wong Tai Sin area as early as 2 p.m., according to a local monitoring group on the Telegram messaging app\n\nAt 2:54 p.m. we moved closer to Plaza Hollywood, one of the biggest malls in the district. Here they found other anxious black-clad protesters \u2014 who had also heard about tear gas being fired via livestream, Telegram groups, or word of mouth.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nThose who hadn\u2019t been equipped started taking out their helmets and gas masks to get ready for any potential confrontations ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll attack some kind of government building to make shame [for] the Chinese government because, you know, we hate them,\u201d Bob told us.\n\ncaption Hong Kong protester Bob* (right) speaks to Insider before protests in Wong Tai Sin on October 1, 2019. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nChina \u201cintervenes in our lives and our politics,\u201d Bob said, adding that he was fighting for universal suffrage \u2013 Hong Kongers\u2019 freedom to vote for whomever they wanted.\n\nHe added that the introduction of the extradition bill this summer \u2013 which would allow Beijing to extract anyone in Hong Kong and try them in the mainland \u2013 was the final straw of Beijing\u2019s breaking its promise to give\n\n\u201cThis will seriously harm our autonomy,\u201d\n\nWe made their way to the nearby Diamond Hill subway station, which had been closed to deter October protests. Prompted by the fear that police would use the closed stations to spring arrest teams, protesters dragged trash cans near the station\u2019s exits, hoping to slow the police down if they elected this route. Here, some of them rest.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nAfter a some debate on where to go next, at around 3:22 p.m., we moved closer to Wong Tai Sin. While en route some of the group tried to remove police road barriers locked into the road to clear their way or to use as barricades. But as they shook the barriers, they failed to come loose. Here\u2019s Bob calling for keys to unlock the barriers.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nBob also picked up a road sign to use as a makeshift shield.\n\ncaption Bob* carrying a road sign to use as a makeshift shield during protests in Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong, on October 1, 2019. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nOver the course of the summer, protesters have been fashioning weapons out of everyday objects, like roadsigns and umbrellas. They have also developed sophisticated hand signals to help communicate with one another.\n\ncaption Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protesters use road signs, trash can lids, and suitcases as makeshift shields during a march on July 21, 2019. source Edgar Su/Reuters\n\nRead more: Hong Kong protesters have developed a sophisticated sign language to help in their months-long battle with police\n\nAt 3:33 p.m. we start to see more riot police on a nearby overpass, about a couple hundred meters from their barricades. Some of the group start debating over whether to leave. Members of this group are saying through their gas masks: \u201cDo we leave? Do we leave?\u201d\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nThe debate ends when the protesters find out another group of protesters are joining, and realize that having the two groups merge would give them the critical mass needed to face off with the police.\n\nWhen we asked Bob whether he thought the debates were causing heavy time loss and tactical disadvantages, he said: \u201cWe are not a dictatorship. This is democracy, we discuss and we decide together.\u201d\n\nLocals brought out boxes of bottled water for protesters to drink on the way. When asked why they brought supplies, one man told us: \u201cWe all support Hong Kong.\u201d\n\ncaption Locals offer bottled water to protesters in Rhythm Garden, Hong Kong, on October 1, 2019. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nWe chat with Bob on the way. One of the reasons he\u2019s protesting is because he believes the city is offering better economic benefits to mainlanders than to locals, saying: \u201cWe cannot really see our future here.\u201d\n\ncaption The Choi Hung public housing estate in Hong Kong. source Shutterstock\n\nWhen asked whether he spoke Mandarin, the Chinese dialect widely spoken in the mainland, he said: \u201cNo, I am not interested!\u201d\n\n(Hong Kongers widely speak Cantonese, another Chinese dialect.)\n\nBob also dismissed the promised economic benefits of China\u2019s \u201cGreater Bay Area\u201d project \u2013 an ambitious project aimed to link southern China, Hong Kong, and Macau through infrastructure and financial projects \u2013 saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want my future to have anything to do with China.\u201d\n\nUpon arriving at the protest site, shortly after 4 p.m., Bob started preparing his bags of wet towels to snuff out tear gas canisters.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nIn a sea of black-clad protesters, this man wearing all white stood out. It\u2019s not entirely clear why he dressed this way. However, white is the color of mourning in many Asian cultures.\n\ncaption A protester dressed in white in Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong, on October 1, 2019. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nA lot of protesters communicated via voice note on their phones while on the front line.\n\ncaption A Hong Kong protester on their phone in Wong Tai Sin on October 1, 2019. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nThey started to congregate under the movement\u2019s \u201cBlack Bauhinia flag,\u201d which is the Hong Kong flag but replacing the red background \u2014 which symbolizes union with China \u2014 with black, and the bauhinia flower with wilting, bloody petals.

He jumped across nearby bushes, grabbed a fuming tear gas canister, stuffed it into his bag and waited for it to extinguish itself.\n\ncaption Bob attempts to extinguish a tear gas canister by shoving it into a bag. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nOther protesters kicked tear gas canisters or threw them toward the police.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nAnother protester started preparing Molotov cocktails to lob toward police. Others threw bricks.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nAt 4:36 p.m. riot police started advancing toward the demonstrators and making arrests. They started running like mad from the police to avoid capture.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nPolice advanced toward the protesters, holding up handguns and batons as a warning.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nAt least one protester was subdued by riot police. Insider has blurred out his face.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nThe same protester was also seen dragged away by at least two riot police officers. It\u2019s not clear what happened to him.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nAt the same time, riot police formed a line and got their tear gas guns ready.\n\ncaption Hong Kong riot police in a line carrying tear gas guns during protests in Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong, on October 1, 2019. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nAround 4:50 p.m. protesters started grabbing chairs from a local restaurant to shield themselves from the police\u2019s rubber bullets. As they gradually withdrew, the protesters returned the chairs to the restaurant, thanking them profusely. The owner also thanked them with a smile.\n\ncaption A protester in Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong adjusts her helmet on October 1, 2019. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nBy 5 p.m. protesters started to regroup, with one of them waving a giant US flag. Many demonstrators have been calling on foreign powers \u2014 notably the US and UK \u2014 to step in and help them.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nEarlier in the summer protesters swarmed the city\u2019s US and British consulates calling for help.

Though they weren\u2019t formally trained as first responders, they said they wanted to do what they could for their fellow protesters.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nBy 6 p.m. the protesters started besieging the police lines again amid clouds of tear gas.\n\ncaption A protester shielding from tear gas with another\u2019s umbrella in Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong, on October 1, 2019. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nAmid the chaos we saw a small sighting of civic-mindedness. As local residents not taking part in the protest crossed the road, protesters urged them to hurry, opening umbrellas to protect them from potential tear gas or rubber bullets.\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nAs protesters set up new barricades across Diamond Hill, we saw many local residents giving a hand to the younger frontliners, often helping them haul bricks or delivering bags of McDonald\u2019s burgers to keep them sustained.\n\ncaption Local residents provide supplies and food to protesters on an overpass above Po Kong Village Road near Diamond Hill, Hong Kong, on October 1, 2019. source Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nHowever, many of the burgers went untouched.\n\nThe Diamond Hill protests raged on until around 7 p.m., with police and demonstrators shifting and regrouping from time to time. As the night closed in, many protesters started spreading joss paper \u2014 fake money typically burned during funerals \u2014to characterize China\u2019s National Day as a \u201cday of mourning.\u201d\n\nsource Marc Fernandes/Insider\n\nWe met a group of protesters who had changed out of their black clothes to avoid police scrutiny as they traveled home. One of them, a teenage protester who called himself Ken, asked us: \u201cDo you think we will win? \u2026 I think we will lose. We will lose because China knows how to divide Hong Kongers.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - October 1, 2019, marked one of the most violent days of the Hong Kong protests against mainland Chinese rule, which has raged into its 17th week..
