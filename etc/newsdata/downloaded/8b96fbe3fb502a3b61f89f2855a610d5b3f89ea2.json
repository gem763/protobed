He says he wants the Bomb.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to his order to launch the military across the border to clear Kurdish areas, Mr. Erdogan made no secret of his larger ambition. \u201cSome countries have missiles with nuclear warheads,\u201d he told a meeting of his governing party in September. But the West insists \u201cwe can\u2019t have them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis, I cannot accept.\u201d\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nWith Turkey now in open confrontation with its NATO allies, having gambled and won a bet that it could conduct a military incursion into Syria and get away with it, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s threat takes on new meaning. If the United States could not prevent the Turkish leader from routing its Kurdish allies, how can it stop him from building a nuclear weapon or following Iran in gathering the technology to do so?\n\n\n\nIt was not the first time Mr. Erdogan has spoken about breaking free of the restrictions on countries that have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and no one is quite sure of his true intentions. The Turkish autocrat is a master of keeping allies and adversaries off balance, as President Trump discovered in the past two weeks.\n\n\u201cThe Turks have said for years that they will follow what Iran does,\u201d said John J. Hamre, a former deputy secretary of defense who now runs the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cBut this time is different. Erdogan has just facilitated America\u2019s retreat from the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe, like the Iranians, he needs to show that he is on the two-yard line, that he could get a weapon at any moment,\u201d Mr. Hamre said.\n\nIf so, he is on his way \u2014 with a program more advanced than that of Saudi Arabia, but well short of what Iran has assembled. But experts say it is doubtful that Mr. Erdogan could put a weapon together in secret. And any public move to reach for one would provoke a new crisis: His country would become the first NATO member to break out of the treaty and independently arm itself with the ultimate weapon.\n\nAlready Turkey has the makings of a bomb program: uranium deposits and research reactors \u2014 and mysterious ties to the nuclear world\u2019s most famous black marketeer, Abdul Qadeer Khan of Pakistan. It is also building its first big power reactor to generate electricity with Russia\u2019s help. That could pose a concern because Mr. Erdogan has not said how he would handle its nuclear waste, which could provide the fuel for a weapon. Russia also built Iran\u2019s Bushehr reactor.\n\nExperts said it would take a number of years for Turkey to get to a weapon, unless Mr. Erdogan bought one. And the risk for Mr. Erdogan would be considerable.\n\n\u201cErdogan is playing to an anti-American domestic audience with his nuclear rhetoric, but is highly unlikely to pursue nuclear weapons,\u201d said Jessica C. Varnum, an expert on Turkey at Middlebury\u2019s James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif. \u201cThere would be huge economic and reputational costs to Turkey, which would hurt the pocketbooks of Erdogan\u2019s voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Erdogan,\u201d Ms. Varnum said, \u201cthat strikes me as a bridge too far.\u201d\n\nThere is another element to this ambiguous atomic mix: The presence of roughly 50 American nuclear weapons, stored on Turkish soil. The United States had never openly acknowledged their existence, until Wednesday, when Mr. Trump did exactly that.\n\nAsked about the safety of those weapons, kept in an American-controlled bunker at Incirlik Air Base, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re confident, and we have a great air base there, a very powerful air base.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone is so confident, because the air base belongs to the Turkish government. If relations with Turkey deteriorated, the American access to that base is not assured.\n\nTurkey has been a base for American nuclear weapons for more than six decades. Initially, they were intended to deter the Soviet Union, and were famously a negotiating chip in defusing the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when President John F. Kennedy secretly agreed to remove missiles from Turkey in return for Moscow doing the same in Cuba.\n\nBut tactical weapons have remained. Over the years, American officials have often expressed nervousness about the weapons, which have little to no strategic use versus Russia now, but have been part of a NATO strategy to keep regional players in check \u2014 and keep Turkey from feeling the need for a bomb of its own.\n\nWhen Mr. Erdogan put down an attempted military coup in July 2016, the Obama administration quietly drew up an extensive contingency plan for removing the weapons from Incirlik, according to former government officials. But it was never put in action, in part because of fears that removing the American weapons would, at best, undercut the alliance, and perhaps give Mr. Erdogan an excuse to build his own arsenal.\n\nFor decades, Turkey has been hedging its bets. Starting in 1979, it began operating a few small research reactors, and since 1986, it has made reactor fuel at a pilot plant in Istanbul. The Istanbul complex also handles spent fuel and its highly radioactive waste.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re building up their nuclear expertise,\u201d Olli Heinonen, the former chief inspector for the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s high quality stuff.\u201d\n\nHe added that Ankara might \u201ccome to the threshold\u201d of the bomb option in four or five years, or sooner, with substantial foreign help. Mr. Heinonen noted that Moscow is now playing an increasingly prominent role in Turkish nuclear projects and long-range planning.\n\nTurkey\u2019s program, like Iran\u2019s, has been characterized as an effort to develop civilian nuclear power.\n\nRussia has agreed to build four nuclear reactors in Turkey, but the effort is seriously behind schedule. The first reactor, originally scheduled to go into operation this year, is now seen as starting up in late 2023.\n\nThe big question is what happens to its spent fuel. Nuclear experts agree that the hardest part of bomb acquisition is not coming up with designs or blueprints, but obtaining the fuel. A civilian nuclear power program is often a ruse for making that fuel, and building a clandestine nuclear arsenal.\n\nTurkey has uranium deposits \u2014 the obligatory raw material \u2014 and over the decades has shown great interest in learning the formidable skills needed to purify uranium as well as to turn it into plutonium, the two main fuels of atom bombs. A 2012 report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u201cTurkey and the Bomb,\u201d noted that Ankara \u201chas left its nuclear options open.\u201d\n\nHans R\u00fchle, the head of planning in the German Ministry of Defense from 1982 to 1988, went further. In a 2015 report, he said \u201cthe Western intelligence community now largely agrees that Turkey is working both on nuclear weapon systems and on their means of delivery.\u201d\n\nIn a 2017 study, the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks the bomb\u2019s spread, concluded that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s efforts to consolidate power and raise Turkey\u2019s regional status were increasing \u201cthe risk that Turkey will seek nuclear weapons capabilities.\u201d\n\nIn response to the German assertion and other similar assessments, Turkey has repeatedly denied a secret nuclear arms effort, with its foreign ministry noting that Turkey is \u201cpart of NATO\u2019s collective defense system.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Erdogan\u2019s recent statements were notable for failing to mention NATO, and for expressing his long-running grievance that the country has been prohibited from possessing an arsenal of its own. Turkey has staunchly defended what it calls its right under peaceful global accords to enrich uranium and reprocess spent fuel, the critical steps to a bomb the Trump administration is insisting Iran must surrender.\n\nTurkey\u2019s uranium skills were highlighted in the 2000s when international sleuths found it to be a covert industrial hub for the nuclear black market of Mr. Khan, a builder of Pakistan\u2019s arsenal. The rogue scientist \u2014 who masterminded the largest illicit nuclear proliferation ring in history \u2014 sold key equipment and designs to Iran, Libya and North Korea.\n\nThe most important items were centrifuges. The tall machines spin at supersonic speeds to purify uranium, and governments typically classify their designs as top secret. Their output, depending on the level of enrichment, can fuel reactors or atom bombs.\n\nAccording to \u201cNuclear Black Markets,\u201d a report on the Khan network by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank, companies in Turkey aided the covert effort by importing materials from Europe, making centrifuge parts and shipping finished products to customers.\n\nA riddle to this day is whether the Khan network had a fourth customer. Dr. R\u00fchle, the former German defense official, said intelligence sources believe Turkey could possess \u201ca considerable number of centrifuges of unknown origin.\u201d The idea that Ankara could be the fourth customer, he added, \u201cdoes not appear far-fetched.\u201d But there is no public evidence of any such facilities.\n\nWhat is clear is that in developing its nuclear program, Turkey has found a partner: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. In April 2018, Mr. Putin traveled to Turkey to signal the official start of construction of a $20 billion nuclear plant on the country\u2019s Mediterranean coast.\n\nPart of Russia\u2019s motivation is financial. Building nuclear plants is one of the country\u2019s most profitable exports. But it also serves another purpose: Like Mr. Putin\u2019s export of an S-400 air defense system to Ankara \u2014 again, over American objections \u2014 the construction of the plant puts a NATO member partly in Russia\u2019s camp, dependent on it for technology.\n\nDavid E.
