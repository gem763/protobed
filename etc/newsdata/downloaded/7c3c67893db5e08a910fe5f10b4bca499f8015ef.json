They say the elders have been too patient about Hong Kong\u2019s precarious situation. But, says Ng dryly, the youths frequently welcome assistance from the older generation\u2019s lawyers.\n\nWith her closely cropped gray hair and an obvious abundance of wisdom acquired from Hong Kong\u2019s many high-stakes controversies, Ng, who plainly states facts as she sees them through her round spectacles, resembles an owl with an attitude. She says Hong Kong\u2019s situation is \u201cdesperate\u201d: \u201cUnder the veneer of a free city, we are under Beijing\u2019s control.\u201d Today, the city is a \u201chair\u2019s breadth from destruction.\u201d She is particularly distressed by police violence, which is a departure from the professional policing bequeathed to this city from its last three decades of colonial rule. Recently, the police have prevented, sometimes for hours, first-aid providers from attending to those the police have injured. The city government under Beijing\u2019s puppet, Carrie Lam, is increasingly resorting to the policy Ng calls \u201cbeat up, lock up and silence.\u201d\n\nLam and her Beijing masters are learning that what Gen. Douglas MacArthur said of military disasters \u2014 that all are explained, in one way or another, by two words: \u201ctoo late\u201d \u2014 is also often true in politics. In April, Lam ignited a long, hot summer by refusing to amend an extradition bill that would have facilitated, by regularizing, Beijing\u2019s penchant for kidnapping into its Kafkaesque criminal justice system inconvenient Hong Kong booksellers and other affronts to totalitarianism. If Lam had promptly done what she has done five months too late \u2014 unambiguously withdrawn the bill \u2014 the protests might have dissipated. Instead, they have metastasized, as has the protesters\u2019 agenda, which now includes more meaningful suffrage \u2014 ending Beijing\u2019s role in approving candidates \u2014 and an independent review of police behavior.\n\nAt a recent lunch at the Hong Kong Club, there were three generations of democracy advocates around a table seating eight. At one end of the age spectrum was Martin Lee Chu-ming, 81, the founding chairman of the city\u2019s principal pro-democracy party. At the other end was Joshua Wong, a prodigy of protesting who, given the stressful life he lives, might in a few years look as old as he now is (22). He was an organizer of the 2014 demonstrations against Beijing\u2019s truncation of popular sovereignty by stipulating those for whom Hong Kongers could vote.\n\nThe lunchtime gathering stressed that the agenda does not include independence for a sovereign Hong Kong. Lam and Beijing should, however, remember that events can generate their own logic: In the early 1770s, restive American colonists, chafing under some annoyances imposed by London, insisted that they sought only restoration of the status quo \u2014 enjoyment of their traditional British rights. But spilled blood \u2014 on Lexington Green, at a bridge in Concord and elsewhere \u2014 quickly led to July 4, 1776.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the Cheshire Cat?\u201d Ng asks, invoking the creature in \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d that in one scene slowly disappears, leaving nothing but its grin. Hong Kong could slowly disappear except for its veneer. Or quickly. \u201cIs [Beijing] prepared to kill Hong Kong?\u201d Ng asks. Young people here, \u201cwho have nowhere else to go,\u201d increasingly think they have nothing to lose. Some of them \u201ccarry their last wills in their pockets.\u201d\n\nThey know they are dealing, ultimately, with a regime that has swept at least 1 million Uighur Muslims into prisons and \u201creeducation\u201d concentration camps. China\u2019s national anthem celebrates \u201cmillions of hearts with one mind.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s protesters are defending a society comfortable with many different minds. And they rightly have turned their anger against so-called smart lampposts \u2014 those likely adorned with facial-recognition technologies that serve policies of social control.\n\nFour decades ago, after President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s 1972 visit to China, and as Americans were beginning to travel there in significant numbers, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) tartly observed that too many returning Americans were more voluble about the absence of flies in modernizing China than about the absence of freedom. Now, however, thanks to the ongoing drama in Hong Kong\u2019s streets, it is possible to hope that the West has passed \u201cpeak China\u201d \u2014 the apogee of blinkered admiration for a nation in which approximately 19 percent of the human race is saddled with one of the world\u2019s most sinister regimes.\n\nRead more from George F.
