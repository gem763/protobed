The Times piece featured this shocking chart depicting an almost flat tax code when federal, state, and local taxes are combined:\n\nDavid Splinter, an economist who\u2019s criticized Saez and Zucman\u2019s income data in the past, has now posted a short but detailed response. (Splinter works with the Joint Committee on Taxation but is speaking for himself here.) Basically, it\u2019s tricky to nail down how much income people actually earn, and thus to use the right denominator when calculating tax rates \u2014 and Saez and Zucman\u2019s decisions tend to make the tax code look much less progressive than it really is by increasing pre-tax income for the rich and reducing it for the poor.\n\nBoth Splinter and Saez/Zucman (and their past coauthors) make an attempt to include income that wasn\u2019t reported to the IRS, which is important because \u201cwage and business income in national income data exceed amounts reported on tax returns by over a trillion dollars\u201d \u2014 but Splinter assigns less of that mysterious income to the rich. Splinter relies on \u201crepresentative IRS audit studies,\u201d while Saez-Zucman make an \u201cad hoc assumption that such income is proportional to reported source-specific income.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA similar phenomenon happens with untaxed retirement income: Splinter doesn\u2019t count \u201crollovers,\u201d which he says merely represent \u201cassets shifting between accounts,\u201d as income. Splinter further doesn\u2019t \u201cdeduct most payroll taxes\u201d before calculating pre-tax income, which would reduce the income of the poor and middle class disproportionately.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSplinter further notes that while Saez and Zucman cite their own past work with Thomas Piketty (\u201cPSZ\u201d) as the source for the tax-rate estimates for 2018 that were ultimately presented in the New York Times, \u201cthe 2018 tax data files used for PSZ estimates will not be available until about a year after their conference draft was posted. Hence, these estimates necessarily use a different method than the cited source.\u201d Splinter \u201cforecasts\u201d 2018 tax-rate estimates himself based on the PSZ paper and finds that they do not quite match the numbers that ended up in the Times, especially at the very top. He also applies the same method to his own past work with Gerald Auten to show how much more progressive the tax code looks under his method.\n\nHere\u2019s a nice chart showing how it all comes together, though unfortunately it doesn\u2019t include the tax rates for the 400 wealthiest taxpayers. Splinter\u2019s method shows a much more progressive tax code, both in 2014 and in the 2018 forecasts:\n\nBy the way, Splinter does not adjust the data to account for refundable tax credits, an aspect of the tax system that disproportionately helps the poor and working class and would make the tax code look even more progressive by reducing tax rates for the lower half of the income distribution by \u201cup to 3 percentage points.\u201d\n\nAlso worth tossing in here: Jason Furman \u2014 yes, from the Obama Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 put together some numbers from other sources, and also found a far more progressive tax code than the NYT presented:\n\nThe standard data shows that the tax system is overall progressive. This chart combines CBO estimates for federal taxes with ITEP estimates for state & local taxes. Federal income taxes highly progressive, when you add in payroll/state/local/etc. is still progressive but less so. pic.twitter.com/WTOgm58Fyo \u2014 Jason Furman (@jasonfurman) October 7, 2019", "description": "A new paper lays out some important details.", "authors": ["Robert Verbruggen", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
