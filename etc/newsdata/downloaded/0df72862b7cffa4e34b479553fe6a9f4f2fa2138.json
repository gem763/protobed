The political aspects were not discussed, and these will be discussed at later stages.\u201d\n\nState media said army units entered the town of Tel Tamer in northeast Syria on Monday, some 35 km from a focal point of the Turkish offensive.\n\n\u201cThe priority now is protecting the border\u2019s security from the Turkish danger,\u201d Xelil said. \u201cWe are in contact with the Damascus government to reach common (ground) in the future.\u201d", "description": "Syrian Kurdish leaders said a deal with Damascus, brokered by Russia, centres for now on army troops deploying along the border and the two sides will talk politics later.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
