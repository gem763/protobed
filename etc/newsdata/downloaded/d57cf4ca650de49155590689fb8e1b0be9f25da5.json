That August number was not a good barometer for the much lower government report of just 96,000 private payrolls in August, but it will be watched nonetheless. Total payrolls were 130,000 in August, including government workers.\n\nThe ADP data is released at 8:15 a.m. ET Wednesday. The report comes right after a surprise drop in manufacturing activity that raised concerns of a manufacturing recession that could spread to the broader economy.", "description": "Wednesday's report of ADP private payrolls could give clues on the labor market, the next part of the economy to be scrutinized.", "authors": ["Patti Domm"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106121934-1568130490594rts2o42y.jpg?v=1568130591", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
