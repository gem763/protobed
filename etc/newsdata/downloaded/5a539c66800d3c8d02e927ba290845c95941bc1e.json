Elizabeth Warren, who is currently atop the polls in New Hampshire, told students at Keene State College last week \u201cWe need big, systemic change in this country, and I got a plan.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, who won the Granite State with 60 percent of the vote in 2016 and remains a top-tier competitor, is promising a \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you think big, we can make transformative change,\u201d he told a rally in Plymouth, N.H. in September.\n\nAnd how are the voters of New Hampshire responding? \u201cWhatevs.\u201d\n\nThere may be no place in America where the message of 2020 Democrats and the lives of the voters they\u2019re hoping to attract are farther apart. While Ms. Warren wails about Americans living in economic desperation and Mr. Sanders insists socialism is the only solution for the free market\u2019s failure, Granite Staters are living some of the best life in the country.\n\nIn fact, U.S. News & World Report named New Hampshire the second-best state to live in the United States.\n\nNew Hampshire\u2019s economy is booming. Businesses are literally closing for lack of workers. The median household income is $71,3065, the eighth highest in the United states. It has the nation\u2019s lowest poverty rate, it\u2019s the best place to raise a child and just this week the Tax Foundation ranked it the only New England state in the top 10 for pro-growth tax policy.\n\nDo Granite State Dems really want to \u201cburn it all down?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are doing well in New Hampshire \u2014 better than any other early state \u2014 and it\u2019s true that a New Hampshire Journal poll earlier this year found that 60 percent of the state\u2019s Democrats say they support America becoming a more socialist country.\n\n\u201cBut look who wins our elections,\u201d says Kathy Sullivan, former chair of the state Democratic Party and the state\u2019s Democratic National Committeewoman. \u201cIt\u2019s almost never the candidate on the extreme.\u201d\n\nShe has a point. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who also served two terms as governor, has built her entire brand on being a centrist Democrat. She\u2019s also one of the 10 most popular U.S. senators in the country.\n\nNone of the Granite State\u2019s D.C. representatives are bomb-throwers, and they\u2019re all relatively popular back home. If there were a \u201cStatus Quo Party\u201d in New Hampshire, it would be at 80 percent.\n\nAnd its mascot would be Joe Biden.\n\nThe former vice president remains popular here, despite his relatively weak performance of late. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg also continues to poll comparatively well, essentially making up the entire \u201csecond-tier\u201d of candidates at around 10 percent. And many political insiders believe Sen. Amy Klobuchar has a potential path forward here as a centrist voice. (Plus, she knows how to hold a press conference in the snow.)\n\nSo why in the land of contentment are candidates of our discontent like Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders still doing so well?\n\nGeography.\n\nAsk yourself: What do Bernie Sanders, Mitt Romney, John Kerry, Paul Tsongas and Mike Dukakis (and if you want to go way back, Ed Muskie and Henry Cabot Lodge) all have in common? They\u2019re all New Englanders who won the New Hampshire primary. Local candidates aren\u2019t a lock \u2014 Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton dropped out of the POTUS primary without ever breaking the Blutarsky barrier (\u201cZero point zero.\u201d)\n\nBut geography has historically been one of the most significant factors in the First in the Nation primary, and also the most overlooked. It\u2019s not the only reason Bernie Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton here \u2014 as evidenced by her recent behavior \u2014 but it helped.\n\nWhich is why, despite the cognitive dissonance of her message, many New Hampshire Democratic insiders expect to add Liz Warren\u2019s name to the New Hampshire winner\u2019s list. She\u2019s got a strong organization here, plus an army of volunteers who can cross the border from Massachusetts and knock on doors. She\u2019s going to be tough to beat, no matter what happens in Iowa.\n\nWill geography overcome economics in the Granite State? It\u2019s still early, but right now that\u2019s probably the best bet.\n\n\u2022 Michael Graham is politics editor of New Hampshire Journal.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
