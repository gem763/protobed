The 9th Circuit\u2019s decision kept the policy blocked in California and Arizona, but allowed it to be implemented in Texas and New Mexico.\n\nThe administration in July issued a new fast-track asylum regulation to prevent migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S. if they first pass through another country and don't apply for protection in that nation. The measure effectively cut off asylum protections for Central American migrants who travel to the U.S.-Mexico border from their home country, but has been hampered by the ongoing litigation.\n\nTigar, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, initially ruled to block the ban temporarily in July after he found the regulation was likely invalid because it conflicted with federal asylum laws. Tigar had also blocked an earlier Trump asylum ban that barred asylum seekers who cross the border between ports of entry.\n\nActing Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan characterized Monday's order as another example of the \"unprecedented judicial activism\" the administration has encountered in attempting to implement its immigration agenda.\n\n\"Every single time that this administration comes up with what we believe is a legal rule or policy that we really believe that will address this crisis, we end up getting enjoined,\" Morgan said at a White House briefing. \"It's very, very frustrating, but we're just going to keep going.\"\n\nWhite House Press Stephanie Grisham called the ruling \u201ca gift to human smugglers and traffickers\u201c in a scathing written statement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration already has petitioned the Supreme Court to set aside the judge\u2019s order and allow the policy to go into effect, and Grisham said Monday that the \"request remains pending.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lee Gelernt, hailed the decision, saying in a statement that the court \"recognized there is grave danger facing asylum-seekers along the entire stretch of the southern border.\u201d\n\nTrump has moved aggressively to curb the flow of Central American migrants seeking to traverse Mexico and cross the United States\u2019 southwestern border.\n\nIn June, he backed off a threat to level escalating duties on Mexican imports, instead striking a deal with President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government whereby Mexico would deploy 6,000 National Guard troops to the country\u2019s southern border with Guatemala to restrain Central American migration.\n\nThat agreement appears to have yielded substantial results, with border arrests dropping to just 51,000 in August from a peak in May \u2014 a decrease of more than 60 percent, according to CBP figures published Monday and first reported by POLITICO.", "description": "U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar issued the order.", "authors": ["Ted Hesson", "Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a6/12/65c6053c4e4d95e6ba964ceeff63/19314-9th-circuit-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
