'Foolishness!'\n\nNiamh (pictured), from Cardiff, shared a text message exchange asking her father to buy sanitary towels on Twitter\n\nNiamh's father responded to her text with a photograph of Always sanitary towels, asking which flavour to buy (pictured)\n\nNiamh received over 31,000 likes on her post but claims many people have slammed her for not asking her mother or buying them herself\n\nThey continued: 'Like, we're all adults here and if anything more men need to grow up and get over being squeamish when it comes to women's periods. The lime/ blackcurrant comment made me laugh though.'\n\nNiamh responded to backlash by explaining she wasn't able to make it to the shops herself.\n\n'For all the people getting wound up about asking my own DAD for pads. 1. He\u2019s only ever lived with females, my sister, my mum, his sister, his mum.\n\n'2. I was in work until 5 shops close at 4 on a SUNDAY i don\u2019t drive, neither does my mum 3. it\u2019s 2019 not 1969,' she wrote.\n\nMany agreed that it's normal for men to buy sanitary towels and that there shouldn't be a problem.\n\nNiamh (pictured) detailed in a follow up Tweet that she was unable to make it to the shops herself because of work\n\nA stream of Twitter users claimed it's normal for men to buy sanitary products for the women in their life\n\nOne penned: 'Blackcurrant or lime! I don't get what the issue with this is? I get them for my misses if she needs them and I have three daughters so looks like I'll be buying them for the rest of my life.'\n\nOther women began sharing their own anecdotes about times they've asked their fathers to buy their right sanitary products.\n\n'First time I asked my dad for pads he thought I said \"bats\" so for at least thirty minutes he was searching for bats in the store lol,' commented one, while a second wrote.\n\n'When my dad used to buy tampons for me, my sister and my mum, he would always ask what colour \"traffic lights\" we needed (green, yellow and orange)\n\nA third added: 'This is totally normal. My dad has had to deal with me, my sister and mum all syncing up for years, he's been on a million tampon and pad runs. Don't see why people are making this into an issue, bizarre'", "description": "A Twitter user from Cardiff has gone viral after asking her father to buy sanitary towels.
