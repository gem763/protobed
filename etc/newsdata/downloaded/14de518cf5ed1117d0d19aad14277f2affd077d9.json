Notably, U.S. crude spiked as much 15.5% to more than $63 per barrel in the early morning trade today \u2014 the biggest intra-day percentage gain since Jun 22, 1998. Meanwhile, Brent soared as much as 19.5% to near $72 per barrel \u2014 the biggest intra-day jump since Jan 14, 1991.\n\n\n\nThe attack is the single-worst sudden disruption ever and is the biggest on Saudi oil infrastructure since Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when Iraq\u2019s military fired Scud missiles into the kingdom. It also exceeds the loss of Iranian oil output in 1979 during the Islamic Revolution, according to data from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n\n\nAbqaiq is the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility and crude oil stabilization plant with a processing capacity of more than 7 million barrels per day while Khurais is the second-largest oil field in Saudi Arabia with a capacity to pump around 1.5 million barrels per day. As a result, the disaster halted nearly half of Saudi's oil production and 5% of the global daily output, threatening global supply (read: ETFs to Win as Saudi's New Minister May Seek Same Oil Policy).\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia could restart a significant volume of the halted oil production within days but needs weeks to restore full output capacity. Many market participants expect the Saudi outage to lead to anxiety over the stability of the world\u2019s oil reserves and has raised worries over more unrest hurting supply.\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs expects crude prices to rise at least in the near term. If outage lasted no more than a week, then it could boost crude by $3-$5 per barrel. If Saudi production remains offline for two to five weeks, it could send prices up by as much as $14 per barrel and more than that could easily prop up oil above $75. Per Sanford C. Bernstein & Co, oil price is expected to rise more than 5% in the short term or more than 20% if impact is protracted. However, President Donald Trump authorized a release of crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which contains over 700 million barrels, if needed to keep the energy market well supplied.\n\n\n\nThe explosion in the region renewed geopolitical concerns that will again weigh on oil price.
