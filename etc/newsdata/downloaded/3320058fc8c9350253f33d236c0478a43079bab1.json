IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT!\u2019\n\nGiving everything away to his 25 million YouTube subscribers, his latest video is entitled \u2018Planting 20,000,000 Trees, My Biggest Project Ever!\u2019\n\nIn the video, he revealed he first tweeted about his goal of planting 20 million trees last month.\n\nHe tweeted (but has since deleted) at the time: \u2018Attention Oregonians! I need an army to plant trees :)\u2019\n\nAnd sure enough, hundreds of people showed up in a field to help plant trees alongside the hugely popular YouTube star.\n\nUnfortunately, the team of volunteers only manage to plant less than 2,000 trees over the course of filming.\n\nSo Mr Beast decided to enlist the help of the largest non-profit tree-planting organisation in the world, Arbor Day Foundation, to help them try to get the tally over the line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s simple: $1 donated (\u00a30.78) = one tree planted.\n\nIn just over an hour since the video dropped, the tree fund received over $600,000 (\u00a3468,000).\n\nMr Beast pledges to plant 20 million trees by 2020 (Picture: @mrbeast / YouTube)\n\nWithin that time frame, fellow YouTubers enthusiastically came out in support of Mr Beast\u2019s initiative, pledging to do their own tree-planting.\n\nBrian Awadis (better known as FaZe Rug) tweeted his support for the initiative to his 2.38 million Twitter followers.\n\nHe tweeted: \u2018Teamed up with @MrBeastYT to have a huge impact in this world!\n\n\u2018Planting 20,000,000 trees by 2020. GO WATCH THE NEW VIDEO!\u2019\n\nWhile Tay Zonday (real name Adam Nyerere Bahner) even wrote a song about his pal\u2019s tree-planting mission.\n\nWant to donate? Check out the Team Trees website.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Beast made headlines when he gave away $10,000 (\u00a37,600) simply because it was his birthday.\n\nHe also revealed he\u2019s donated over $1 million (\u00a3791,000) over his online career.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
