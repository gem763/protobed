It takes time.\n\n\u201cSo that was the first goal, to be completely in shape and able to perform at the highest level physically.\u201d\n\nWilliams claimed her last Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 2017, before taking maternity leave.\n\nShe returned to competition at the French Open the following year, reaching the fourth round before withdrawing through injury, and reached the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.\n\nInjuries have remained frustratingly in the picture, though, with a back problem forcing her to retire during the Rogers Cup final and withdraw from Cincinnati, after she again reached Wimbledon showpiece at the All England Club.\n\nWilliams also twisted her ankle during her quarter-final loss at the Australian Open. [nL5N25S0YT]\n\n\u201cShe got injured several times, especially in the lower part of the body, which is very annoying because you can\u2019t do anything, basically,\u201d said Mouratoglou.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do sports and it delays a lot the moment when you\u2019ll be able to compete again.\u201d\n\nBut coming off the various injuries, the eighth-seeded Williams said throughout the U.S. Open that she had embraced a more intense and demanding training routine.\n\n\u201cI just feel like I actually had time to train,\u201d she said after her semi-final win over fifth-seed Elina Svitolina.\n\n\u201cI just had a really tough year with injuries, mostly bad luck. I just needed to get injury-free.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nMouratoglou said she had done just that.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks before Wimbledon, 10 days to be precise, (she) finally got rid of her knee problem and she was able to run without thinking about her knee,\u201d added Mouratoglou.\n\n\u201cSo now it\u2019s several weeks in a row, so I think her fitness just went up and up.\u201d", "description": "Serena Williams will have every weapon at her disposal when she steps onto the Arthur Ashe Stadium court on Saturday bidding for a record seventh U.S. Open crown, her coach Patrick Mouratoglou told reporters.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427057556&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8520W", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
