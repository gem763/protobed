And proponents say the metro will be far more beneficial to the environment than the trees, warning that Line 3, slated to open in December 2021, could now be delayed due to the opposition.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many trees had already been cut down on Friday. Police detained dozens of activists trying to protect the trees.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper, citing senior officials, reported that 2,134 trees were already gone. The Mumbai Metro Rail Corp Ltd (MMRCL) did not immediately respond to a request for information.\n\nThe controversy over the trees has become a political issue in Maharashtra, which is holding state elections on Oct. 21. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's local ally, the Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena party, has criticised the decision to cut the trees.\n\nThe Mumbai Metro 3 is a 35-kilometer project due to carry an estimated 170,000 people a day between city's business districts and the far-flung suburbs.\n\nAn average of ten people, mostly the poor, now die every day on Mumbai's overcrowded trains, according to the government.
