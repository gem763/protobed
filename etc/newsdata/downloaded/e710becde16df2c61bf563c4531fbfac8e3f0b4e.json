This is what I went through. This is why wedding planning was either hard or easy for me, whatever it is.\u2019 And just being a plus-size woman getting married,\u201d McGrady said.\n\nOne of the biggest pieces of advice that McGrady offered as a plus bride was about throwing away any feedback that people had given about shopping for a wedding dress to flatter her figure.\n\n\u201cEveryone always told me my whole life, \u2018You\u2019re a bigger girl, don\u2019t wear anything skintight, we don\u2019t want to show off those curves. Don\u2019t wear anything covered up to here because it doesn\u2019t look great on your bust,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cSo naturally, I\u2019m like, well give me the tightest, sexiest dress for my ceremony and then give me a high neck for my reception. I was like, I\u2019m gonna go against the grain because I love those two things.\u201d\n\nStill, she admitted that throwing away those preconceived notions of what a plus bride should look for in a dress didn\u2019t make it easy to find one that she loved. Instead, she had to make hers custom with Watters for just the right fit.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t just go down to Soho or Fifth Avenue and shop. That doesn\u2019t exist for me,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut yet, 70 percent of America is a size 14 or above.\u201d\n\nAnd while Fashion Week events like TheCurvyCon \u2014 a three-day convention that brings together celebrities, body-positive influencers and their fans to celebrate diversity and fashion inclusivity \u2014 show that there\u2019s progress being made in embracing body positivity on the runway, McGrady is not surprised that the exclusive Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show is rumored to not be taking place this year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s women who are literally desperately saying, \u2018Please, please, please get bigger sizes, showcase trans women,\u2019\u201d she said of the feedback facing the lingerie brand.\n\nBut instead of being fixated on what\u2019s wrong with brands like Victoria\u2019s Secret, McGrady stays focused on those who are doing right by women of all shapes and sizes \u2014 namely, Savage X Fenty by Rihanna.\n\n\u201cI mean they had every woman on the runway and it was blasted around the world because people were like, \u2018Wow. This is what I want to see,\u2019\u201d McGrady noted. \u201cSupport people who are doing it right. I think we\u2019ll get there though, I\u2019m very optimistic.\u201d\n\nGo to TheCurvycon.com to buy tickets for the 2019 convention.\n\nVisit Yahoo Lifestyle on Friday, Sept. 6 and Saturday, Sept. 7 to watch our livestream of TheCurvyCon 2019, and follow us on Instagram for some fun activations before the event!", "description": "Hunter McGrady is shedding light on problems that still exist in plus-size fashion after becoming the first plus bride to cover \"The Knot.\"", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RugQj44hpr0QJRQd6gOIfg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/2bf25240-cf5d-11e9-a7fb-aa39743a2e0c"}
