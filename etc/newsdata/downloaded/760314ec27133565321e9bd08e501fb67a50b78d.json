Now, we have another look into the inner workings of Darnielle's life with In League with Dragons, a 12-song album due out in April about the beloved tabletop role-playing game/lifestyle Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nIt's small wonder that Darnielle hasn't already crafted an album about D&D, given the extensive mythologizing and cult status that surrounds it. The album's lead single \"Younger\" reads like a shadowy, rollicking mini-epic, and ends on an unexpected, but wholly awesome saxophone outro \u2014 the sort of instrumental backing you'd want to commence a hero's journey. He brands it \"dragon noir.\"\n\nDarnielle writes about In League with Dragons:\n\nThis album began life as a rock opera about a besieged seaside community called Riversend ruled by a benevolent wizard, for which some five to seven songs were written. When I'm focusing on a project, I always distract myself from the through-line with multiple byways, which are kind of like mini-games within the broader architecture of a long video game. As I worked on the Riversend stuff, weird noir visions started creeping in, probably under the influence of Leonardo Sciascia (a Sicilian author, he wrote mysteries) and Ross MacDonald's The Zebra-Striped Hearse, which a friend from Port Washington gave me while I was in the thick of the writing. I thought these moods helped complicate the wizards and dragons a little, and, as I thought about my wizard, his health failing, the invasion by sea almost certain to wipe out half his people, I thought about what such a person might look like in the real world: watching a country show at a midwestern casino, or tryout pitching for an American League team years after having lit up the marquees. Finally, I wrote the title track, which felt like a drawing-together of the themes in play: rebellion against irresistible tides, the lush vistas of decay, necessary alliances. I am earnestly hoping that a new genre called \"dragon noir\" will spring from the forehead of nearly two years' work on these songs, but, if not, I am content for this to be the sole example of the style.\n\n(If you're a player, or a Mountain Goats fan, Darnielle is hosting a premiere event Monday afternoon on Magic: The Gathering's Facebook page.)\n\nIn League With Dragons is out April 26 on Merge.", "description": "The album's lead single \"Younger\" reads like a  mini-epic, and ends on an unexpected, but wholly awesome saxophone outro \u2014 the  sort of instrumental backing you'd want to commence a hero's journey.", "authors": ["Joshua Bote"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/28/_images_uploads_gallery_181201_mtn_goats_0240_wide-634d4603c7b82c9664bdf39079daa4a88c4ff1bf.jpg?s=1400"}
