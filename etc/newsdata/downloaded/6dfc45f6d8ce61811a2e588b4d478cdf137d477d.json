As one of only four low-lying coral atoll nations in the world, the failure of the international community to adequately respond to the global climate crisis of its own making holds particularly grave consequences,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nOur parliament has officially declared a national climate crisis.

Heine (@President_Heine) October 10, 2019\n\nThe official declaration of the \u201cNational Climate Crisis\u201d cites the findings of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that warned of the extreme climate effects expected to impact low-lying atoll nations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe report predicted that a global average temperature rise between 1 and 3 degrees Celsius could result in an average sea level rise between 1 and 4 feet by 2100.\n\nSuch significant water rising could have grave impacts on the Marshall Islands, an archipelago in the southern Pacific Ocean. At that rate, sea level rise and erosion are expected to make the islands nearly uninhabitable by 2050. The country\u2019s 29 atolls average 6.5 feet above sea level. Nearly 75,000 people live there.\n\nThe resolution says it\u2019s a decision by the government to \u201cunite fully and equivocally behind the science\u201d and recognize calls by the country\u2019s youth and their \u201cright to a climate safe future.\u201d It adds that the declaration puts climate concerns at the forefront of the nation's mind.\n\n\u201cThe declaration will direct the current and future governments of the Marshall Islands to ensure the fight against climate change remains the country\u2019s top priority,\" it says.\n\nIt additionally asks the international community to consider new ways to support the \u201cextreme vulnerability\u201d of the island nation.\n\nIn February, Heine first announced a plan to begin elevating the country\u2019s islands to keep them habitable.\n\n\u201cRaising our islands is a daunting task but one that must be done,\u201d she told Marshall Islands Journal at the time.\n\n\u201cWe need the political will, and especially traditional leaders\u2019 commitments, to see this through. That is why a national dialogue is planned to bring all the parties together.\u201d", "description": "The Republic of the Marshall Islands, one of the lowest lying island nations in the world, has declared a national emergency over\u00a0climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/marshallislands_10112019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
