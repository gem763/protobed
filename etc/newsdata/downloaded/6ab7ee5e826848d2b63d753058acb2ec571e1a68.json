The application also indicates when and where to look for the highest priority marks. The company explained:\n\n\u201cThe number of satellites is increasing by 25x. Collisions threaten the technology we depend on every day and our spacefaring future. [...] TruSat is designed to be a citizen-powered system for creating a globally-trusted record of satellite orbits \u2014 a freely available resource that can be used to assess orbital operations in light of the space sustainability standards.\u201d\n\nAn open space initiative\n\nAccording to technology news outlet GeekWire, ConsenSys Space co-founder Chris Lewicki highlighted the role of the Ethereum blockchain in preserving data integrity, stating:\n\n\u201cDesigning a system that is at once open, autonomous, and resistant to malicious and erroneous inputs presents considerable engineering challenges. [...] A big part of what makes this possible \u2014 what allows users to have confidence that neither the algorithms nor the output have been tampered with \u2014 is the Ethereum blockchain technology integrated throughout our roadmap.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 31, 2018, ConsenSys Space\u2019s first initiative was the acquisition of asteroid mining firm Planetary Resources. The company explained its purpose at the time:\n\n\u201cWe envision a space program in which any person can participate and contribute. So we're building collaboration platforms to diversify, democratize, and decentralize space endeavors.\u201d\n\nNotably, this is not the first blockchain-based project that involves space. On Dec. 18, 2018, blockchain development firm Blockstream has expanded its satellite service and is now broadcasting Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) blockchain to all of Earth\u2019s major land masses.", "description": "Blockchain software technology company ConsenSys unveils Ethereum-based satellite tracking app TruSat", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy84NDkxMzQ3NWJhYmQwOTdiYzI0OWUyYzZjZjk3YzhjMS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
