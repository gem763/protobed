His son Hunter was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice-president.\n\nTrump already faces impeachment inquiries but the Ukraine call is reported to be related to an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about the president\u2019s behaviour which is at the heart of a standoff between the White House and Congress.\n\nAs the weekend rolled in, a new question set Washington abuzz. Did the US president use or attempt to use military aid to Ukraine as leverage in seeking the investigation of a political rival?\n\nTrump and Zelenskiy spoke on 25 July. About a month later, it was reported that $250m in US military assistance to a country fighting Russian-backed separatists was being delayed after Trump requested a review.\n\n\u201cThe potentially most explosive issue here is whether the president essentially offered Ukraine a quid pro quo,\u201d Richard Pildes, professor of constitutional law at New York University, told the Guardian.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll provide substantial US foreign aid if you provide damaging information concerning Joe Biden or his son.\u2019\u201d\n\nRepublican claims about the Bidens and Ukraine concern a visit by the then vice-president in March 2016. The country\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired soon after \u2013 an aim of the US, allies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which thought Shokin was turning a blind eye to corruption.\n\nAn investigation into company for which Hunter Biden worked was dormant at the time. In May this year, Ukraine prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko told Bloomberg News \u201cwe do not see any wrongdoing\u201d by the younger Biden.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump used Twitter to allege it.\n\n\u201cThe Fake News Media,\u201d the president wrote, \u201cand their partner, the Democrat [sic] Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won\u2019t get a very large amount of US money, so they fabricate a story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine.\n\n\u201cNothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn\u2019t want to report!\u201d\n\nHe also tweeted a video on the subject produced by his campaign.\n\nOn Friday, Trump was asked if he brought up Biden in the call with Zelenskiy.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed,\u201d he said. He also urged the media \u201cto look into\u201d Biden\u2019s background with Ukraine.\n\nBiden said that if the reports were true, \u201cthen there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country\u201d.\n\nHe also said Trump should release the transcript of his conversation with Zelenskiy.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s behaviour was filed on 12 August. The US government\u2019s intelligence inspector general has called it \u201cserious\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d. On Friday Trump dismissed it, insisting \u201cit\u2019s nothing \u2026 just another political hack job\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have conversations with many leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always appropriate. Always appropriate. At the highest level always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country.\u201d\n\nBut questions remain about Trump\u2019s view of Russia and relationship with Vladimir Putin, even after the conclusion of an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election by Robert Mueller. The special counsel did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy but did lay out links between Trump aides and Russians and multiple instances of potential obstruction of justice.\n\nRussia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in June 2014 and now backs separatists in the Donbass region. On Friday the Washington Post cited a former senior administration official who had \u201crepeatedly discussed the issue with Trump\u201d as saying the president thought military aid to Ukraine \u201cwas pointless and just aggravating the Russians\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s position basically is, we should recognize the fact that the Russians should be our friends, and who cares about the Ukrainians?\u201d the Post quoted the official as saying.\n\nUkrainian foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko, meanwhile, told Ukrainian outlet Hromadske his country was not interested in taking sides in US politics, but said Zelenskiy had the right to keep the contents of his conversation with Trump secret. He also said US investigators had every right to uncover information.\n\n\u201cI know what the conversation was about and I do not think there was any pressure [from Trump],\u201d Prystaiko said. \u201cThere was a conversation, different conversation, leaders have the right to discuss any existing issues. This was a long and friendly conversation that touched on a lot of issues, sometimes requiring serious answers.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani's quest for dirt on Biden via Ukraine \u2013 a timeline Read more\n\nIn New York next week, Trump and Zelenskiy will meet on the sidelines of the United Nations.\n\nIn Washington, the standoff with Congress over the whistleblower complaint raises fresh questions about the extent to which Trump appointees are protecting the president.\n\nAdam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, has said he will go to court to get hold of the whistleblower complaint. Trump has abused Schiff on Twitter.\n\nLawmakers are also looking into whether Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to investigate Hunter Biden.\n\nOn CNN on Thursday, Giuliani was asked if he asked Ukraine to look into Biden. He said, \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d but seconds later added: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d\n\nThe former New York mayor has spent months trying to drum up damaging evidence about Biden\u2019s ties to Ukraine. He told CNN Trump was unaware of his actions.", "description": "Trump reportedly urged Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2018eight times\u2019 to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son as Biden pushes for transcript release", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce3a3bf0320152ff4dd2649fbb251f3c7549895/0_84_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a3385ca82bef7ee0fb16d1abb303dc6a", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
