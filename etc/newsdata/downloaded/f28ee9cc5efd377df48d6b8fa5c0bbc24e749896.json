July\u2019s additions were upgraded from 159,000 to 166,000 and August\u2019s from 130,000 168,000.\n\nAverage wages, however, fell.\n\nWall Street cheered the mixed report, which highlighted a falling unemployment rate but kept in play a possible Fed rate cut this month, which would be the third since July.\n\nInvestors bought both stocks and bonds. That demand pushed up the Dow Jones industrial average by 228 points, or nearly 1%, at midday. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was down marginally to 1.52%.\n\nThe jobs numbers were released amid mounting concerns that the economy may be heading toward a recession. A manufacturing index this week showed a contraction in activity for a second straight month in September and at the briskest pace in 10 years. Producers cited the toll taken by President Trump\u2019s trade war with China and a sluggish global economy.\n\nTaco deals: National Taco Day 2019: Where to go for $1 tacos and deals Friday\n\nWho says convertibles are dead?

An index of activity among services firms revealed expansion last month but at the slowest pace in three years. The service sector makes up 80% of the economy and had been bolstered by steady consumer spending. But U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are nudging up store prices and dampening retailers\u2019 confidence.\n\n\"This is as good as it's likely to get until the trade war is resolved,\" Ian Shepherdson, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said of the September job gains in a note to clients.\n\nFILE - In this June 21, 2019, file photo a now hiring sign is displayed to attract potential workers at a McDonald's restaurant in Moss Point, Miss.

Solis, AP)\n\nEmployment growth has slowed to an average monthly pace of 161,000 this year from 223,000 in 2018, though last year\u2019s figures are expected to be revised down sharply.\n\nTwo main factors are crimping job gains.The low unemployment rate has made it tougher for businesses to find workers. And the economy has slowed as the effects of federal tax cuts and spending increases peter out and the trade war dents business confidence and investment.\n\nIn an effort to dodge a recession, the Fed has lowered its key interest rate twice since late July despite a still-solid economy. Some economists expect another rate cut at a Fed meeting late this month.\n\nCable costs: Consumer Reports: Hidden cable TV fees may cost you $450 extra annually\n\nHoliday cheers: McDonald's announces Cinnamon Cookie Latte, its first seasonal drink in more than 5 years\n\nWages dip\n\nAverage hourly earnings edged down 1 cent to $28.09, pushing down the annual gain from 3.2% to 2.9%.\n\nYearly pay increases began topping 3% in the second half of 2018 as employers bid up to attract fewer available workers, but haven\u2019t gained further momentum. That has kept inflation subdued, providing the Fed another reason to reduce rates as early as this month.\n\nIndustries that are hiring\n\nBusinesses added just 114,000 jobs while federal, state and local governments added 22,000. Health care led the private-sector job gains with 41,000. Professional and business services added 34,000; leisure and hospitality, 21,000; and transportation and warehousing, 16,000.\n\nManufacturers lost 2,000 jobs in a sign the trade war and slowing global economy continue to take a toll. Retailers cut 11,000 jobs, partly reflecting a longer-term shift to online shopping.\n\nBroader unemployment gauge falls\n\nA wider measure of unemployment -- that includes part-time workers who want full-time jobs and discouraged Americans who have given up job searches, as well as the unemployed \u2013 fell from 7.2% to 6.9%, a 19-year low.\n\nWhat it means\n\nThe September report was a mixed bag. A disappointing 136,000 jobs were added but totals for the prior two months were revised up by 45,000. And unemployment fell to a new 50-year low but wages slipped, nudging down annual pay increases to the slowest pace July 2018.\n\nPantheon\u2019s Shepherdson said the report was good enough to keep the Fed from trimming rates this month, but Morgan Stanley said it likely gave the central bank enough evidence for another cut.\n\nCLOSE Although U.S. employers added a modest 130,000 jobs in August, a sign that hiring has slowed, the White House stressed the positives in the report, especially wage gains and the re-entry of many workers into the labor market.
