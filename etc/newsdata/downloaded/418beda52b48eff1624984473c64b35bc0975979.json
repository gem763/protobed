Ron DeSantis were all scheduled to speak, the Times reported.\n\nThe video shows Trump\u2019s head superimposed on a man who shoots and stabs church parishioners with media logos as heads. The clip looks to have been edited from a scene in the 2014 action-comedy, \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service.\u201d\n\nThe massacre takes place in the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d and includes PBS, NPR, Politico, the Washington Post and NBC. Trump also attacks the late Sen. John McCain, stabs Rosie O\u2019Donnell and lights Sen. Bernie Sanders on fire.\n\nYouTube\n\nFake Trump also beats up Mitt Romney, Barack Obama and many more.\n\nAn attendee reportedly took a video of the clip on his phone and used an intermediary to send to a reporter at the Times. Parts of the video appear to have been taken from this YouTube clip from back in 2018.\n\nIn a statement Sunday night, CNN denounced the video, saying: \u201cSadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the President have promoted violence against the media in a video they apparently find entertaining \u2014 but it is by far and away the worst. The images depicted are vile and horrific. The President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less amounts to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke and many others shared their thoughts on social media:\n\nAt a conference of Trump supporters, they played a video of our president murdering journalists in a church. Last year, a Trump supporter sent bombs to CNN\u2014and a shooter entered a church yesterday. This video isn\u2019t funny. It will get people killed. https://t.co/XWtq1z38Kc \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 14, 2019\n\nReaction the @whca: \u201cWe have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.\u201d https://t.co/WKqLSwtEKk pic.twitter.com/hIOaqjBmUB \u2014 Philip Crowther (@PhilipinDC) October 14, 2019\n\nThe video of a mass shooting by the President inside a church is reminiscent of the Charleston shooting. Executing members of the media is reminiscent of the Maryland newsroom shooting.\n\n\n\nThis video is racist and hateful and it\u2019s flabbergasting that it was shown at Trump\u2019s resort. pic.twitter.com/v9BqxZ4Ns5 \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 14, 2019\n\nThe organizer of the event denounced the video and told the Times that the clip had been played at the conference as part of a meme exhibit.\n\n\u201cContent was submitted by third parties and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity,\u201d organizer Alex Phillips said. \u201cAmerican Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech. This matter is under review.\u201d\n\nSources told the Times that Donald Trump and his son were unaware of the video and Sanders said she also hadn\u2019t heard of the video until she was contacted.\n\n\u201cI was there to speak at a prayer breakfast, where I spoke about unity and bringing the country together,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of any video, nor do I support violence of any kind against anyone.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump refers to the mainstream media as \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d and in a violent fake video shown at a conference for his supporters at...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT204_trump_MG_20191013220343.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
