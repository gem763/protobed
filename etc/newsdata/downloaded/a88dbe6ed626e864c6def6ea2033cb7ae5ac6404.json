Shortly after she left, she received a call that would change the next two years for the young girl and her family: Aliyah had snapped herself in the face with an exercise band, injuring her left eye. She was in a lot of pain.\n\nTODDLER DIAGNOSED WITH PEDIATRIC CATARACTS AFTER MOM NOTICED CLOUDINESS IN EYES: 'HIS WORLD WAS CLOSING IN'\n\nArambul quickly returned home and took the young girl to a local eye doctor. She wasn\u2019t expecting the damage to be severe, she said. But the doctor who initially saw Aliyah asked if she had two different colored eyes \u2014 a blue and brown. Aliyah has blue eyes, her mother said.\n\nThe young girl had a total hyphema, meaning the space between her cornea and iris was full of blood \u2014 giving the appearance her left eye was brown.\n\n\u201cHer eyes looked like they were different colored,\u201d she recalled.\n\nThe doctor then urged Arambul to take her daughter to the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital in Portland \u2014 nearly four hours away from their home in Pasco. They arrived that evening, but were later referred to the OHSU Casey Eye Institute, she said.\n\nAliyah developed a cataract due to damage her eye sustained, and she required surgery to remove the lens on her left eye and replace it with an artificial one. Later on, Aliyah underwent two additional surgeries to remove scar tissue.\n\nDuring that time, Aliyah was required to wear an eye patch for hours each day. The patch was worn over her right eye in order to strengthen the vision in her left. Her mom also said her left eye required \u201chundreds\u201d of drops on a frequent basis.\n\nThree surgeries, months of patching and follow-up appointments took a toll on her daughter and the family, Arambul said.\n\n\u201cIt was really emotional, I was crying and she had the biggest smile [on her face].\" \u2014 Jessie Arambul\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really lonely experience when your child has a serious health issue,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Aliyah persevered.\n\nOver the past year, she wore the patch less and less until, on Sept. 6, she was cleared to remove it altogether.\n\nBrainstorming celebratory ideas, Arambul, who runs a photography business on the side, decided to mark the occasion with a photoshoot.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to do superhero outfit,\u201d she said, hence the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d shoot. (Aliyah had one stipulation, however--her costume had to be pink.)\n\nWOMAN BATTLING RARE \u2018SUICIDE DISEASE\u2019 HAS LEG AMPUTATED IN HOPES OF FINDING RELIEF FROM CHRONIC PAIN CONDITION\n\n\u201cIt was really emotional, I was crying and she had the biggest smile [on her face],\" she said.\n\nArambul posted the photos on Facebook, never expecting them to garner as much media attention as they have, she said.\n\n\u201cI was not expecting the response,\u201d she said. \"We wanted to celebrate her \u2014 and to say thank you to the doctor who saved my daughter's vision.\u201d", "description": "A young Washington state girl who nearly lost her sight in one eye following a freak accident recently celebrated her near-perfect vision with a fitting \u201cWonder Woman\u201d themed photoshoot.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Jessie Arambul", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
