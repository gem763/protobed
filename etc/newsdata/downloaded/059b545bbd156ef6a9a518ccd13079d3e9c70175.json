She found a Pinterest picture that she wanted to try and recreate,\u201d fianc\u00e9 Collin Hewett wrote in the tweet. I botched it.\u201d\n\n\"Well, we found the right angle but I didn't find the right angle with the bottle,\" Collin told Buzzfeed News.\n\n\"I was super hesitant the whole way and then it started to just dribble out the end. So I kind of over adjusted.\"\n\nThankfully, Alyssa had a spare outfit with her, so the shoot was able to continue.\n\n\"We were dying laughing,\" she said. \"Our photographer fell on his butt because he was laughing so hard. He managed to still snap pictures of us.\"\n\nBut many Twitter users were a fan of the candid shots, after they were retweeted 56,000 times.\n\nOne said: \"Adorable you should put those on the wedding invites.\"\n\nAnother said the photo had made him laugh, and wished the couple the best in their marriage.\n\nAnd Alyssa took to Twitter to reassure everyone she was OK, after the incident.\n\n\"I'm fine btw,\" she tweeted.\n\nOthers shared their own \"botched\" engagement photos, while others compared the prices of champagne used.", "description": "The pair, who met while studying in Illinois, US, tried to recreate something sweet after getting engaged in August", "authors": ["Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704266.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_engagement-photo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
