Filming has begun, with Pochettino\u2019s blessing, but he half-joked that he must add the title of \u201cproducer\u201d to the rest of his responsibilities.\n\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino says 5-0 win is a \u2018first step\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cWhen the club agreed the deal with Amazon, of course we were worried about it,\u201d Pochettino said, referring to himself and his staff. \u201cBecause it is not easy, not easy. It is tough to have the camera in your office, and then how you handle the situation to have the capacity to say: \u2018OK, I am not in a good mood, but sometimes the camera is going to be there.\u2019 It is so complicated, it is another thing to worry about and of course that adds a lot.\n\n\u201cIf we were busy, now we are super busy. To plan every day, everything, is not an easy job. That is why, when I told you I feel that I am not any more a manager, I am a coach, now I am like a producer. Being coach, manager and producer.\u201d\n\nWhile Pochettino may be worried about showing his best face for television, there is the obvious risk that Tottenham themselves will not come out glowingly if their fortunes on the pitch do not improve. It is, the manager accepts, simply a danger inherent to the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is like when we started to do the book [Inside Pochettino\u2019s Spurs, in 2017] one season. It was the same risk. The most important is to live the reality, not to try to generate something that is fake or not real. And then what you are going to love, what the people are going to love to see, is that we are normal people working. We can win, we can lose.\n\n\u201cLike the book, I hope there is a happy ending. But if not, you are going to see another point of view, from a different vision.\u201d\n\nJadon Sancho holds all the cards as Dortmund look to cash in on his promise | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nVictory at Anfield on Sunday, in Tottenham\u2019s first meeting with Liverpool since their defeat in the Champions League final, would improve the chances of a positive denouement. The form books might suggest that is an improbable outcome, and Spurs have not won in the past nine iterations of this fixture, but Pochettino believes his embattled squad remains a match for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cOf course, because I love my players and believe we have an unbelievable squad with unbelievable players,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we are at our best we can beat any team.\u201d\n\nHe offered a reminder that Liverpool have been free of the stadium-related upheaval, and associated strains, Spurs have faced over the past half-decade. \u201cOf course, expectations are so high, but when you analyse five years ago, both clubs have different objectives in that time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor them, they were focused on trying to build a team that can compete and win titles. For us, the same because we are so competitive, but the priority was in different areas. That makes it more difficult.\u201d", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino likened himself to a producer after raising concerns about Tottenham\u2019s decision to film an Amazon Prime documentary covering this season", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282691cf584e0044a448502ce71a7c7ff437d713/173_219_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a46469681a5f9363e60308da2ef1d669", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
