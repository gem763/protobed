He was in Japan to find support for his economic policy, holding bilateral meetings with his counterparts as well as leading members of the business community.\n\n\"Japan left good memories in the Democratic Republic of Congo and it continues to do so,\u201d Tshisekedi told Africanews. \u201cThe fact that I have been received here shows the clear interest that Japan attaches to my country and I am proud of it.\u201d\n\nNearly 15,000 kilometres from the Japanese capital, the Congolese Investment Promotion Agency (ANAPI) in Kinshasa also offers support to local businesses.\n\nWhile Japan calls for more economic cooperation, ANAPI asks Tokyo to support the DRC on major infrastructure projects, such as the proposed hydroelectric dam on the Congo River at Inga Falls.\n\nANAPI\u2019s Managing Director, Anthony Nkinzo Kamole, said the DRC was hoping for continued Japanese assistance.\n\n\u201cI'm talking about the Great Inga, for example. We expect them to participate on the infrastructure issue. When the Japanese people start doing something, there is seriousness, there is longevity and there is an assurance that the product is fairly well made.\u201d\n\nJapan has also contributed to the international response to the Ebola crisis, helping to modernise the Biomedical Research Institute in Kinshasa.\n\nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is supporting the work of Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, winner of the Hideyo Noguchi Prize.\n\nProfessor Muyembe said: \"A whole team from Japan has arrived to be able to prepare the other provinces that are adjacent to the regions that are currently affected: so we are preparing them in case the epidemic ever comes to these provinces, especially Tshopo province.\u201d", "description": "The DRC's F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi was one African leader attending the TICAD summit - the first Congolese head of state to attend.
