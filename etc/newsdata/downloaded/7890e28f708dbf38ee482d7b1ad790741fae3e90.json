Housing and Development Board\n\nLove wildlife? Well, the lucky residents of BTO\u2019s newest project, Punggol Point Crown, will live in an estate inspired by one of Singapore\u2019s earliest zoos, HDB announced on Sunday (Sep 1).\n\nPonggol Zoo, a popular zoo run between 1920 and 1940 by wildlife collector William Lawrence Soma Basapa, boasted Albert Einstein among its visitors, and was even used as a set for 1933 American film, Dyak before its forced closure at the start of World War II.\n\nInspired by the zoo\u2019s heritage, Punggol Point Crown will have five thematic zones based on forests, grasslands, and the shoreline, featuring native plant species, such as edible fruit trees.\n\nThe estate\u2019s signs, community spaces and outdoor furniture will be designed after the 200 animals and 2,000 birds in the old zoo, and a heritage walk will feature facts about the zoo animals, as well as animal footprints on the ground.\n\nPunggol Point Crown will feature an animal-themed heritage walk, a first among new BTO projects. Housing and Development Board\n\nMeanwhile, a second project \u2013 the second phase of Punggol Point Cove \u2013 is themed after a fishing village to commemorate the area\u2019s former status as a fishing port.\n\nThe blocks in Punggol Point Cove will be staggered downwards to maximise views of the sea. Housing and Development Board\n\nThe estate will feature fishing nets and wave-like designs, and have sky bridges connecting various blocks.\n\nLike Punggol Point Crown, it will also have zones based on the beach and forest, with rain, shade and flowering gardens featuring native plants that attract birds, butterflies, and dragonflies.\n\nEach block in Punggol Point Cove will have its own courtyard.
