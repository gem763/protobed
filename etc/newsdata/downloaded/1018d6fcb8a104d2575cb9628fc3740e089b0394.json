Here is a fragment of their \u2018cultural offerings,\u201d he wrote, linking to the trailer.\n\nThe fictional thriller series is based on the best-selling books by Tom Clancy and stars John Krasinski as CIA analyst Jack Ryan.\n\nIts second season will start streaming on Amazon on Nov. 1.\n\nAmazon Studios, a unit of Amazon.com Inc, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMore than 4 million people have left Venezuela to escape hyperinflation and rising malnutrition, creating a regional migration crisis. Maduro blames the situation on U.S. sanctions that have hobbled the country\u2019s oil industry.\n\nVenezuelan officials for years accused the United States of preparing an invasion to steal its vast oil resources.\n\nThe country\u2019s socialist politics, rampant crime and open confrontation with the United States has made it attractive to the U.S. entertainment industry.\n\nAction adventure video game Mercenaries 2, released in 2008, was set in a fictionalized war-torn Venezuela. That fueled outrage among Venezuela\u2019s ruling Socialist Party, who called it an apology for U.S.-backed violence in the region.\n\nIn a 2013 episode of Showtime spy series \u201cHomeland,\u201d the main character was held hostage in an unfinished Caracas office building turned squatter settlement known as the \u201cTower of David.\u201d", "description": "Venezuela's culture minister has accused Amazon television series \"Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan\" of promoting an invasion of the South American nation, following a trailer for the second season that appears to put Caracas at the center of a global conspiracy involving nuclear weapons.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427039209&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851VM-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
