FOREX-Euro falls against dollar after Draghi gives ECB swansong\n\n(Recasts, new throughout; adds analyst quote; changes dateline,\n\nprevious LONDON)\n\nBy Kate Duguid\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Despite some optimism from\n\nMario Draghi's final news conference as president of the\n\nEuropean Central Bank, the euro fell against the dollar on\n\nThursday, pulled down by business surveys which point to\n\nstagnating economic momentum in the euro zone.\n\nAt its policy-making meeting Thursday, the ECB kept interest\n\nrates on hold and left its ultra-easy monetary policy unchanged.\n\nWeak growth across the euro zone notwithstanding, Draghi said\n\nthe benefits of loose policy far outweighed the risks and\n\nrejected the suggestion that a public split with policy hawks in\n\nthe bank had tainted his legacy. Much of Thursday's focus was on his decision to push through\n\nthe open-ended bond-buying scheme that will tie his successor\n\nChristine Lagarde's hands for years to come, despite opposition\n\nfrom a third of policymakers. Draghi played down the dissent,\n\npointing out that all moves made in September were backed by\n\nmajorities and were once again confirmed by the outcome of this\n\nmonth's meeting.\n\nAgainst the dollar, the euro had rallied after the\n\nECB's decision and press conference, but it quickly gave up\n\nthose gains, weighed down by weak data releases. It was last\n\n0.25% weaker at $1.110.\n\n\"We came into the morning thinking that there would be a bit\n\nmore optimism than usual from Draghi as it is his last meeting,\n\nand we didn't think he would want to end his tenure on a\n\ndownbeat note,\" said Thierry Wizman, global interest rates and\n\ncurrencies strategist at Macquarie Group.\n\n\"We detected some optimism towards the end of the press\n\nconference which is why the euro rallied at around 9 a.m. ET.\n\nAnd then it sold off. There was no news in the pipeline to help\n\nit stay up.\"\n\nBusiness weakness in the euro zone was reaffirmed on\n\nThursday when IHS Markit's flash composite purchasing managers'\n\nindex for October, seen as a good guide to economic health, came\n\nin below forecasts and perilously close to the line separating\n\ngrowth from contraction. The U.S. dollar was stronger on the euro's move, in spite of\n\nweak domestic data released Thursday morning. The dollar index\n\nwas up 0.18% to 97.663.\n\nNew orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell more than\n\nexpected in September and shipments also declined, a sign that\n\nbusiness investment remains weak amid the continuing fallout\n\nfrom the U.S.-China trade war. However, another report on Thursday showed the number of\n\nAmericans filing applications for unemployment benefits\n\nunexpectedly fell last week, pointing to a tight jobs market\n\neven as hiring and economic growth has slowed.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Euro falls against dollar after Draghi gives ECB swansong", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE1F13X_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
