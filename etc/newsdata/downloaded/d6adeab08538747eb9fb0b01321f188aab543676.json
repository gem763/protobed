Professor moderators? With presidential debates, Democrats don\u2019t buck tradition.", "language": "en", "text": "Now Stevens says the aborted debate is a lesson for both parties, exposing the celebrity essence of the primary debate process, which lines candidates up behind lecterns like contestants in a game show, answering a battery of questions from a panel of high-profile journalists. This kind of performance, which Trump embraced in 2016 to ride a ratings bonanza all the way to the White House, was used in both of the first two Democratic debates this summer. It will be on display again Thursday, when 10 Democrats face off in Houston for the third debate of 12, this one hosted by ABC and Univision.\n\nJoin our live debate video show at 7:30 p.m. Thursday and following the debate\n\nStrip away the extravagant backdrops and the dramatic intros, and the process is not so different from when primary debates began proliferating in the 1980s, alongside the growth of cable news. For years, candidates and their allies have complained about the strict time limits, the glib questions from moderators and the emphasis on conflict over substantive exchange.\n\nThe protests continued this year, with former vice president Joe Biden recently ridiculing the rules of the first two debates as, \u201cTell me your life story in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I think everybody knows these aren\u2019t debates,\u201d he added.\n\nStevens said the solution is simple: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t start from scratch.\u201d\n\nTo the Republican strategist, that means dispensing with the networks that currently host and produce \u2014 and maintain exclusive rights to televise \u2014 the debates. Instead, parties should look to universities as partners, he said. Professors should ask the questions, but of only four candidates at a time.\n\nOther ideas include a tech-enabled national town hall and a simulation testing how would-be presidents might respond to a crisis.\n\n\u201cI would do it,\u201d Ed Rendell, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and governor of Pennsylvania, said of various alternative proposals. \u201cI think it\u2019s so important to get some sanity in the process.\u201d\n\nThe difficulty would be finding an audience, Rendell said, suggesting Amazon or another major technology company might be interested in streaming the events. (Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, did not return a request for comment about whether it would entertain the idea.)\n\nThe Democrats did not consider drastic changes going into their competitive primary, according to an official involved in planning the debates who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The framework has grown out of intense deliberations, guided by the aim of giving their candidates a national platform while insulating the party from charges of bias, which roiled the 2016 primary.\n\nThe party has insisted on certain changes, such as no weekend debates and the inclusion of a woman and a person of color among the moderators for every showdown. To accommodate the crowded field, the party insisted on two consecutive debate nights when necessary, with random selection determining which candidates appear each night \u2014 though Thursday marks the first time this cycle that entry requirements limited the event to one night.\n\nOtherwise, Democrats hewed to tradition.\n\nInnovations introduced over the years serve mainly to highlight the basic uniformity of the process. Televised town halls were introduced in the general election in 1992. A revolution in the way voters consume news, with a sharp turn away from television, has spurred only modest efforts to incorporate new media, including with beamed-in YouTube questions during the 2008 cycle, mostly remembered for the anthropomorphic snowman, \u201cBilliam,\u201d who pressed the candidates on climate change.\n\nBehind the glitz and glamour, the debates are largely the same. Perhaps for good reason: Primary debates still rank high among moments that voters say helped them make a decision.\n\n\u201cThe point of debates was to bring everybody together to watch and listen and learn,\u201d said Newton N. Minow, President John F. Kennedy\u2019s chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and an architect of presidential debates, who famously called television a \u201cvast wasteland.\u201d\n\nNow, said Minow, 93, \u201cthe country is badly divided,\u201d in part, he added, because of the explosion of television networks, which helped propel the growth of primary debates in the 1980s.\n\nThe first primary debate, in 1948, featured New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey and former Minnesota Gov. Harold Stassen, who were competing for the Republican nomination. Their exchange, on whether to outlaw the Communist Party, was broadcast nationally by several radio networks, reaching between 40 and 80 million listeners. Each man spoke for 20 minutes, and then each had a rebuttal. Journalists watched from behind a glass wall.\n\nIt was only once cable networks entered the picture in the 1980s that primary debates multiplied, said Mitchell S. McKinney, a professor of communications at the University of Missouri. In 1988, competitive primaries in both parties produced 22 debates, he said. The number reached 43 in 2008, which was also the year Democrats set a record with 26 televised debates, McKinney said.\n\nThere was one fewer Republican debate than initially hoped in the 2012 cycle, when the planned Newsmax debate, to be broadcast on Ion Television, fell apart after Romney and others walked. Though Trump was sidelined at the time, his hope that he could make presidential politics as compelling as his ratings juggernaut has shaped the calculus of both parties.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an assumption that people want to see blood and guts,\u201d said Rendell, the former DNC chair.\n\nThe need to attract viewers has bound the parties to the networks, which guarantee a delivery mechanism and assume the costs of what have become elaborate jamborees, with high-dollar venues, high-tech spin rooms and a high volume of journalists.\n\nIn 2016, partnerships with tech giants, among other businesses, helped defray the costs. Four years later, marketing opportunities have become less important for the titans of Silicon Valley, which have made their name in politics \u2014 not altogether favorably.\n\nDemocrats are encouraging distribution on social media, with some success. NBC streamed the first debate live across YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, attracting millions of viewers, and ABC will do the same on Thursday. CNN did not, preferring independence from the platforms and arguing its cable channel and website offered the best viewing experience.\n\nCNN declined to say how much it spent on the July debates, while NBC did not return a request for comment on costs. ABC declined to say how much it expected to spend this week.\n\nSome question whether the bells and whistles are necessary.\n\n\u201cThe networks should not be running off and producing these things,\u201d said Frank Fahrenkopf, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a co-founder and current co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates. The nonpartisan corporation, which took over from the League of Women Voters, oversees the rhetorical combat during the general election, which runs without network control or commercial interruption.\n\nRendell said he would prefer a model in which the primary season begins with four conventional debates, followed by six issue forums as the field winnows.\n\nCNN recently devoted seven hours to a climate forum with the Democratic candidates, averaging 1.1 million viewers during the segment, a fraction of the viewership for its July debates. The second installment of NBC\u2019s debate in June was a record for Democratic primaries, with 18.1 million viewers across NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.\n\nA new model might invite better ways of testing the candidates and drawing out differences among them, said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at the centrist think tank New America.\n\nOne format he has advocated is crisis simulation, in which the candidates would respond in real time to a hypothetical scenario, forced to monitor public opinion, ask questions and work with advisers. In the process, he argues, contestants would \u201chelp the public understand what the president actually does.\u201d\n\nOther possibilities include expanding on the town hall format, which McKinney, the communications scholar, said reduces political cynicism by involving regular citizens.\n\nHe raised the prospect of a \u201ctrue national town hall.\u201d Debate sponsors already pull audience members from the community hosting the faceoff, McKinney said. \u201cPerhaps we could draw citizens from various parts of the country, who have been affected by the topics being debated, and they could pose questions to the candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe technology is there,\u201d McKinney said. \u201cWhat if we used it to improve the substance of debates, and not just their entertainment value?\u201d\n\nCleve Wootson contributed to this report.", "description": "The model on display this week in Houston resembles reality television.
