Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) campaign left the team just one day after joining over a controversial video that sexualized Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nMatt Orfalea joined the Sanders campaign after making a viral 2020 Sanders video titled \u201cRising Up.\u201d However, his employment was short-lived, as he resigned just a day after joining the team after controversial videos from his past surfaced\u2013 specifically, a video that sexualized MLK\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream Speech.\u201d\n\nHe explained in a Medium post published Monday that the decade-old video was aimed to demonstrate \u201cmedia manipulation\u201d but also admitted that it was a \u201cpathetic attempt at comedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was about 20 yrs old, I edited MLK audio, to expose how easily media can completely misrepresent reality,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post.\n\n\u201cThat intention has been clearly stated in the Youtube description for 10 years. It was supposed to be a \u2018reminder that media on tv or the web can be edited to twist facts/reality,'\u201d he added.\n\nThe description of the video reads:\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was a great man. The real, \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech is amazing. And society is undeniably better thanks to MLK and the civil rights movement. No one should be ever be judged based on their race/ethnicity. The purpose of this video is to show people that media on the web and TV can be edited to really twist facts/reality.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when the vulgar ridiculousness of the final product made me laugh,\u201d Orfalea continued. Looking back at it now makes me ill. I choose not to delete it only because I want to be fully transparent. I\u2019m sincerely sorry I ever made it.\u201d\n\nOrfalea also faced backlash for the content of in some of his other videos, in which he used the terms \u201cretarded\u201d and \u201cgay.\u201d He apologized profusely:\n\nDespite my thoughtless past use of the word \u201cretarded\u201d, I hold absolutely no prejudice toward anyone with special needs. In fact, I live happily with my adult special needs younger brother. Likewise, many years ago in my 20\u2019s, I referred to the cliche use of clones in youtube videos as \u201cgay\u201d. I am sorry to say that growing up it was a term used regularly and casually by my peers to refer to something \u201csilly\u201d or \u201clame\u201d \u2014 not actually referring to homosexuality at all. I\u2019ve never had any issues with anyone\u2019s sexuality.\n\nHe added that he is \u201cashamed\u201d of his \u201cpast contribution to the endless supply of dumb Youtube videos\u201d and explained that he eventually pivoted toward more \u201cmeaningful\u201d videos, such as the Sanders \u201cRising Up\u201d video.\n\nOrfalea ultimately said he decided to leave the Sanders campaign because he did not want a \u201cdumb 10 year old youtube video to distract from the real issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll initial job offers are contingent on the completion of a final review of a person\u2019s record,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said of Orfalea\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cThat vetting process had not yet been completed. It\u2019s clear some of Matt\u2019s prior social media content does not reflect the campaign\u2019s values,\u201d he added. \u201cWe accept his resignation.\u201d", "description": "A video creator for Sen.
