Bernie Sanders, a self-described \u201csocialist,\u201d is doubling down on his efforts to give federal officials total control over Americans\u2019 health care.\n\nThe senator has just unveiled the Medicare for All Act of 2019 with 13 leading Senate Democrats, including fellow contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination: Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nAmericans should find this bill chilling. If passed, it would essentially abolish all private health coverage in America, regardless of whether Americans like their current plans.\n\nHere are the specifics.\n\nOutlawing Current Coverage\n\nThis bill, title by title and section by section, is almost identical in substance to the Medicare for All Act of 2017 (S.1804) introduced last Congress.\n\nUnder Title I, the bill would create a new national health insurance plan to provide universal coverage to all U.S. residents, regardless of their legal status. This new program would be phased in over a four-year period.\n\nUnder Section 107, the bill would outlaw private health coverage, including employer-sponsored coverage, that \u201cduplicates\u201d the coverage provided under the government health plan. Approximately 181 million Americans would lose their existing private coverage.\n\nLike the earlier version, the new Senate bill would also abolish other federal health programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, Tricare, and the popular and successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The tens of millions of Americans currently covered by these programs would also be involuntarily absorbed into the new government health program.\n\nUnder Title II, the bill would provide 13 categories of health benefits, including a new long-term care benefit. This is a richer benefit package than that contained in the earlier Sanders bill, which listed 10 categories of benefits. Also like the earlier bill, taxpayers would be compelled to fund abortion, and the bill would override current law that ensures conscience protections for medical professionals.\n\nThe new bill would also eliminate virtually all cost sharing, except for a limited out-of-pocket obligation for prescription drugs. This provision, of course, would induce increased demand for medical services and thus increase the overall costs of the program.\n\nUnder Title II, the bill would set forth detailed terms and conditions for the participation of doctors and other medical professionals in the government system, including the limiting conditions governing private contracts.\n\nUnder Section 303 of the new Senate bill, private contracts between doctors and patients would be discouraged. Doctors who choose to take private payment from patients outside the system would face a stiff penalty.\n\nUnder Section 303, the physician would have to sign an affidavit that he engaged in such a contract, submit it to the secretary of health and human services, and then forego all reimbursement from all other patients enrolled in the new federal entitlement for a period of one year. Few doctors, of course, would be able to do such a thing.\n\nThis is essentially the same policy embodied in the previous version of the Sanders legislation, and an even more restrictive version is embodied in the House bill (H.R. 1384).\n\nThis, along with the abolition of all insurance alternatives, would come as a striking restriction on patients\u2019 personal liberty. Interactions with physicians are sometimes focused on highly sensitive matters, and patients might desire confidentiality and prefer not to submit a claim either to a government agency or even a private insurance company.\n\nThen, of course, there is also the problem of getting access to specialized services. If the government plan, operating as a monopoly, does not or cannot offer you what you want or need, you would have no viable alternative under this legislation.\n\nThe Likely Consequences\n\nIf the Senate bill\u2014or some version of it, such as the House Democratic bill\u2014were to become law, ordinary Americans could surely expect three major consequences.\n\n1. Slower care.\n\nWith a single government health program designed as an entitlement for 327 million Americans\u2014providing services \u201cfree\u201d at the point of service\u2014utilization would explode. Americans would face long waiting lists, delays, and even denials of medical care. It would be unavoidable.\n\nThe experience of \u201csingle payer\u201d countries, like Britain and Canada, shows that waiting lists for medical treatment are common, especially for hospitalization and specialized medical services.\n\n2. Even fewer doctors available.\n\nToday\u2019s doctor shortage, fueled by accelerated retirements and physician burnout, would surely worsen. Beyond imposing Medicare\u2019s huge regulatory regime and its paperwork burden on the entire nation, the Senate bill would impose Medicare payment rates (rates lower than private insurance) as the means to reduce reimbursement for all doctors, hospitals, and medical professionals. Former Medicare Trustee Charles Blahous estimates that this would translate into a stunning 40% decline in medical reimbursement.\n\nWhile leftist ideologues might vigorously applaud such a radical reduction in physician payment as a major source of health care \u201csavings,\u201d the negative impact on patient access and quality of care would be incalculable.\n\n3. Massive new taxation.\n\nCuriously, the new Senate bill, like its predecessor, has no financing provisions. Instead, as with the last version, Sanders has offered a list of financing options that could be used to pay for this massive enterprise, including a 4% income-based premium, a 7.5% payroll tax, the elimination of all tax breaks for existing health insurance, and a series of taxes on wealthy citizens.\n\nIndependent analysts have concluded that such \u201coptions\u201d would fall far short of covering the true costs of such a program, meaning that individuals and families would pay much higher taxes than the senator\u2019s revenue proposals anticipate. Both the liberal Urban Institute and the conservative Mercatus Center projected that the earlier version of the Sanders\u2019 plan would cost approximately $32 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThose earlier projections are obsolete, because the senator has now added a costly long-term care program to the bill\u2019s mandatory benefits package.\n\nThis is not a realistic way forward. Socialism is the wrong prescription for Americans who want quality, affordable health care.", "description": "Independent Vermont Sen.
