(Picture: Fox 61)\n\nA football team has outraged parents by cutting two little boys with disabilities.\n\nEight-year-old Kevin Blackman and nine-year-old Amadi Towe were both kicked off their youth football team in New Haven, Connecticut last Wednesday.\n\nBoth boys also have learning disabilities and were axed from the team after their parents turned their Individualized Education Program report cards to league officials.\n\nAn IEP report card is a specialized education plan for a child with a disability in Connecticut. Both boys played in the Pop Warner football league, which is the only national youth sports league that requires children to prove they are doing well in school before they are permitted to play.\n\nTowe\u2019s mother, Mijija-ife Waters, told Fox 61 that after her son learned he was off the team, \u2018(he) began to cry. He said he wished he was normal.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I tried to explain to him, \u201cYou are normal. You just learn different,\u2019 Waters said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaters later posted about her son\u2019s removal from the team on Facebook, which is when Blackman\u2019s mother, Sylvia Roman, realized her son was not alone.\n\nDonald Trump says assassinated Isis leader's replacement has already been killed\n\nBoth parents said they were given vague explanations that their sons were removed from the team because of a \u2018scholastic issue.\u2019\n\nHowever, Waters said league officials must not know what an IEP report card is \u2013 or that there are federal laws that prohibits discrimination based on disability.\n\nShe said: \u2018Who ever (is) running this league, they need to do their homework, do their research. These kids are protected under the American Disabilities Act.\u2019\n\nWaters hit out at the league and accused it of discriminating against her son, despite federal laws that specify that children with disabilities must be given the same opportunity to play sports as anyone else. (Picture: Fox 61)\n\nThe American Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) specifically states that students with disabilities must have the same opportunities to participate in sports as anyone else.\n\nBoth boys\u2019 families had already payed for their children to play for the entire season.\n\nSchool 'knew bullied girl, 12, was going to kill herself but didn't tell her parents'\n\nReggie Lytle, who has been the president of the league for 22 years, said he was supposed to discuss the issue at a meeting with the league\u2019s executive board, but the meeting was canceled.\n\nLytle said: \u2018They refused to meet with me, I got a text canceling the meeting, I wanted to explain what an IEP is and some of the laws, but I never had the opportunity.\u2019\n\nThe executive board has not yet commented on the matter.", "description": "Kevin Blackman, 8, and Amadi Towe, 9, were both kicked off their youth football team in New Haven, Connecticut last Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1572353891_1572356245.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
