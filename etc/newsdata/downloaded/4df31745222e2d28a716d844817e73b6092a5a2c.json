I\u2019m not sleeping very much but I feel closer to him than ever. I really wish and pray that I\u2019ll find Boetie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m virtually walking in his footsteps \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly emotional.\u201d\n\nColeen arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam on Friday and on Monday she went to the South African embassy, where she was given John\u2019s passport. John was last seen on 18 May in Ho Chi Minh City. He\u2019d been staying in a backpackers\u2019 lodge called Nine.\n\n\u201cI wept bitterly when I took the passport,\u201d Coleen says. \u201cI asked them what\u2019s being done [to find him]. There must be someone who knows something \u2013 people don\u2019t just disappear. They told me police and the hospitals have no new information.\u201d\n\nHis work visa had expired so he won\u2019t be allowed to work in Vietnam. He couldn\u2019t have left the country because he doesn\u2019t have his passport with him. Police in Ho Chi Minh City, where John had been on holiday at the time he went missing, found his passport and clothes in his room and posted the passport to the SA embassy.\n\nNguyen Thi Thu Thanh, a friend of John\u2019s, is helping Coleen get around the country as it\u2019s her first time travelling abroad. Yesterday, they were set to travel to Binh Xuyen, where Johan had been teaching English.\n\n\u201cI believe I\u2019ll find answers there,\u201d Coleen says.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t understand why Interpol came to her house in SA two weeks before her departure to gather new DNA samples of John\u2019s. They were able to get the DNA from one of his razors and a pair of shoes that he\u2019d worn without socks.\n\nColeen will also be meeting Faheema Daniels, the mother of SA citizen Mushfiq Daniels, in Ho Chi Minh City. Mushfiq, who\u2019d also been teaching English, is also missing and was last seen on 5 July.\n\n\u201cI can only express my incredible gratitude for everyone\u2019s love and support. People will never know how much I appreciate it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m constantly on my knees, praying that God will send the right people and channels my way. But I don\u2019t have much time left \u2013 I\u2019m flying back on Sunday,\u201d Coleen says.\n\n\u201cI really wish I could be taking John home with me.\u201d", "description": "\"When I see someone on a scooter or just people walking around, I wonder if it\u2019s him.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9429/59757bc4b3024c4ab7da6b4fd4475533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
