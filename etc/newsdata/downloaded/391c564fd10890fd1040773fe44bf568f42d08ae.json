I impeach you.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nThe U.S. Constitution, as written by the framers, contains seven articles.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s version goes to 12.\n\nTrump informed lawmakers of his \u201cSpinal Tap\u201d approach to constitutional law three years ago, but current events make it more ominous in the retelling. Asked what he would do to protect the Constitution\u2019s Article I powers \u2014 the powers of Congress \u2014 he reportedly responded, \u201cI want to protect Article I, Article II, Article XII.\u201d\n\nWe now know he had no intention of protecting Article I, and we have a good idea what must be in those five unwritten articles that exist only in the president\u2019s imagination:\n\nArticle VIII gives Trump the power to solicit and receive the help of foreign governments in his election.\n\nArticle IX gives Trump the power to ignore congressional subpoenas and to block witnesses from testifying. (Trump\u2019s latest exercise of Article IX powers came Monday; George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, failed to show up for a deposition before three House committees.)\n\nArticle X gives Attorney General William P. Barr the power to reach out directly to foreign leaders and intelligence services \u2014 without involving the FBI or the Justice Department\u2019s international personnel \u2014 to solicit information that could help Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nArticle XI exempts Trump from turning over his tax returns, no matter how many laws or court orders say otherwise. (A federal judge became the third to rule against Trump in the matter on Monday, condemning Trump\u2019s \u201ccategorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process.\u201d)\n\nAnd Article XII gives Trump the power to impose extralegal punishments, including the impeachment of Congress.\n\nTrump appeared to be exercising these Article XII powers on Saturday when he said that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) is a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019 \u201d who should be impeached. (Romney had criticized Trump actions as \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d) The (real) Constitution does not provide for impeaching lawmakers, but Trump on Sunday expanded his extra-constitutional demand, saying \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d Pelosi and \u201cLiddle\u2019 Adam Schiff\u201d were guilty of \u201cTreason\u201d and must be \u201cimmediately impeached.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a variant of Trump\u2019s \u201cNo puppet, you\u2019re the puppet\u201d defense. You can\u2019t impeach me \u2014 I impeach you!\n\nFighting impeachment, Trump employs two familiar arguments. One is to accuse his opponents of whatever he\u2019s accused of. The other is to blurt out obscenities. Before branding Romney an \u201cass,\u201d Trump informed 65 million Twitter followers that the Democrats\u2019 case is \u201cBULLSHIT.\u201d (Objectively accurate headline: \u201cTrump Tweets Bullshit.\u201d)\n\nIt hardly matters that Trump\u2019s new plan to impeach his accusers is not, technically, legal. As during the Russia inquiry, ignorance of the law might be his best (and perhaps only) defense. The ignorance seems genuine: In addition to developing a 12-article Constitution, Trump has mused about attacking migrants with bayonets and alligators, \u201cordered\u201d U.S. businesses to find alternatives to China, proposed to rewrite a constitutional citizenship provision by fiat and routinely accused those who criticize him of \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nTrump, also calling his critics \u201cspies,\u201d recently pined for the \u201cold days when we were smart with spies and treason\u201d and \u201cwe used to handle it a little differently.\u201d Ah, yes, the good old days, when those accused of treason were summarily shot. Perhaps he\u2019ll also use his Article XII powers to bring back the halcyon days of cruel and unusual punishment; he could order that Romney be given 30 stripes, send Pelosi to the ducking stool and crop Schiff\u2019s ears.\n\nEven if he did, it\u2019s a safe bet Republicans would respond as they are now: by looking the other way or by insisting Trump was just joking. Only unelected Republicans seem to notice how awful they look excusing this behavior. Colin Powell says the GOP \u201chas got to get a grip on itself.\u201d Kerry Kircher, House counsel for the Republicans between 2011 and 2016, told The Post\u2019s Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade that Trump \u201cis shaking the foundations of the republic.\u201d Even Trump loyalist Tucker Carlson wrote of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call: \u201cSome Republicans are trying, but there\u2019s no way to spin this as a good idea.\u201d\n\nSo what can Democrats do about it? They could always take an article from Trump\u2019s unwritten constitution, and assert their newfound powers to brand the letter \u201cR\u201d (for rogue) on Trump\u2019s cheek, to chain Barr to the whipping post or to sentence uncooperative witnesses to bilboes and pillories.\n\nBut Democrats don\u2019t have to follow Trump into the constitutional wilderness. In the \u201cold days,\u201d Congress\u2019s inherent contempt powers allowed lawmakers to impose fines and to detain those who ignored subpoenas. Trump\u2019s extra-constitutional antics have set off court battles that will, by design, outlast any impeachment inquiry. In the meantime, Democrats would be justified reviving a practice that is both legal and proportional when administration witnesses refuse to testify.\n\nLock \u2019em up.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The president is taking a journey into the constitutional wilderness.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "October At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
