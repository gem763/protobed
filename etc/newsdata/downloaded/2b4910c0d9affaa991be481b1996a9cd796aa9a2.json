All garments are fully CE marked (Cat II PPE). This means all garments comply fully with European laws, rules and regulations, which most definitely state that all PPE must be CE certified:\n\nAll clothing to be worn or held by any end user to offer any type of protection is PPE and as such MUST be CE certified for sale in the European Union.\n\nIf a company is using the clothing for protection and/or to improve the health and safety of the wearer at a workplace then they must be using appropriately CE market products.\n\nYou are not allowed to sell anything within the EU that could be defined as PPE without appropriate CE marking.\n\nDue to all recent changes of all European legal requirements, rules and regulations, CutPRO\u00ae has seen a spectacular increase in the number of inquires for their product range.\n\nRobert Kaiser says: \u201cWe seem to be a breath of fresh air to all glass producing and processing facilities.
