Joe Kennedy III to try and follow JFK into Senate by challenging Sen. Ed Markey", "language": "en", "text": "Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, will announce Saturday a primary challenge for the U.S. Senate against Democratic incumbent Edward Markey, despite apparent resistance from party leaders, according to multiple reports.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nKennedy, 38, will unveil his plans for a Senate run at a breakfast for supporters in East Boston, the Boston Globe reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. He informed Markey of his decision on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cJoe plans to make a campaign announcement this Saturday in East Boston. He looks forward to speaking with folks then,\u201d Kennedy spokeswoman Emily Kaufman said in a statement to the Globe.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign will center on core issues including health care, climate change and civil rights, the Globe said. Markey is considered a champion of leading progressive causes and co-sponsored the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d with freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe U.S. representative for Massachusetts\u2019 4th congressional district since 2013, Kennedy is also the grand-nephew of former President John F. Kennedy and longtime U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy.

Kennedy filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission in late August.\n\n\u201cI am humbled by the words and actions of so many people supporting my potential candidacy. It means the world,\u201d Kennedy said at the time. \u201cI plan to spend the next couple weeks talking to as many of you as I can, trying to figure out if this campaign is right for me and right for Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nLeading Senate Democrats had reportedly warned Kennedy to hold off on a challenge against Markey in what is considered a solidly Democratic state in a contentious 2020 election cycle, Politico reported. Markey\u2019s prominent supporters include Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va) and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts\u2019 senior U.S. senator.\n\n\u201cI would tell Joe to wait,\u201d Manchin said earlier this month. \u201cThose type of fights when two people are aligned ideologically?
