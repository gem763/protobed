I'm not sure. I don't think those rumors are true. She just really didn't want to bring another child into this world because of the things that go on.\n\n'I don't think she'd have a child on her own. So unless she has someone in her life, that's what they want together, God bless them, and if that's what they want, I'll be happy for her,' she said.\n\nIn 2017, Anthony said that it was 'unlikely' she would be 'dumb enough to bring another kid into the world, but sources told People in September she was looking to 'find some meaning in her life.'\n\nAnthony was branded the most-hated mom in America after she was accused of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008.\n\nThe toddler's remains were found in a trash bag in woodlands near the family home in Orlando, Florida, months after she was reported missing.\n\nAnthony, who was 19 when she gave birth, was accused of neglecting her only child and killing her to get out of her parental responsibilities.\n\nShe was found not guilty following a six-week trial in 2011.\n\nAnthony (pictured during her trial) was branded the most-hated mother in America after she was accused of killing her child to get out of her parental responsibilities\n\nThe high-profile trial destroyed Anthony's relationship with her parents, particularly her father, who at one point the defense accused of being responsible for Caylee's death\n\nCaylee's remains were found in a trash bag in woodlands near the family home in Orlando, Florida, in December 2008, months after she was reported missing\n\nDuring the interview, Cindy told Dr Oz she believes Caylee's death was an 'accident' saying: 'I think she [Anthony] just panicked and I think it just snowballed into a big mess.'\n\nCindy and George had previously revealed they no longer speak to their daughter.\n\nThe sit-down comes nearly a year after George was involved in a near-fatal car crash in Daytona Beach that left him with brain and spinal injuries.\n\nAt the time, Cindy told DailyMail.com she had cut off contact with Casey to devote her time to her husband saying, 'I don't need her drama.'\n\nThe trial destroyed Anthony's relationship with her father, who the defense claimed had sexually abused his daughter from a young age.\n\nThey also accused him of being responsible for Caylee's death, arguing he hid the body after she drowned in the pool at his Orlando home.\n\nHowever, during the interview, George said he still loves his daughter and issued a heartfelt plea for her to 'come home.'\n\n'I don't think that she would have to feel afraid to come back to the house, to our house, because she's been there,' he told Dr Oz.\n\n'Come home. I would love to just get that hug and be able to talk to her just one more time. I wouldn't force her into saying something, I would want her just, there's something she wants to say to me, just say it to me from your heart. Just be that young lady or that young woman that I love, and I still do.'\n\nGeorge said he also sent an emotional letter to Casey, telling her he was ready to forgive her.\n\n'I just want to let her know how I felt, how this has taken a big toll on your mom or on her mom and knowing that, I never know what's going to happen from now on with me, with her. I know of one thing I did say to her, I would love to see you and I would love for mom to know where you're at, how you're doing. I said, Casey, no matter what I'm still your dad and I love you.\n\nBoth parents said they believe the 33-year-old was a 'good mom' the first time around\n\nThe interview comes nearly a year after George was involved in a near-fatal car accident in Daytona Beach, Florida that left him with brain and spinal injuries (right). The father is now calling for Anthony to 'come home'\n\n'That was hard for me, but I needed to get that from me because you can't move on if you keep on holding all these things inside, you need to able to express yourself.\n\n'Even though what she's done to Caylee, to her and I or anyone else, I just wanted to know that I was ready to forgive her, at least I wanted to see her and talk to her,' he said.\n\nThe pair also discussed George's emotional wellbeing after he revealed he had battled with depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nAt one point, Cindy was 'terrified' to leave her husband alone knowing he had threatened to take his own life. The most difficult thing, she said, was listening to him say she would be 'better off' without him.\n\nGeorge told Dr Oz: 'I don't feel that way now. These last few months has curtailed back my feelings about ending my life because I know I have more to give to her and hopefully to somebody else someday.'\n\nAnthony, meanwhile, has managed to keep a low profile since her acquittal and was last known to be living in West Palm Beach with a friend.\n\nEarlier this year she told DailyMail.com: 'Regardless of what the media has depicted of me, I am not a monster. I just don't show my sadness. A thing that was taught to me as a young girl.\n\n'I suffer on the inside. I learn to make peace and put on a smile to cover the sadness.\n\n'Through it all, I never once thought of suicide. I am stronger than that..that is a coward's way out, and it is a sign of guilt to me.'", "description": "George and Cindy Anthony have addressed rumors that their daughter Casey is considering having another child before her 'biological clock' runs out, in an interview with Dr. Oz.", "authors": ["Karen Ruiz For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/14/20379958-0-image-a-2_1572446215472.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
