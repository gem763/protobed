Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nHere are some key things to watch for Thursday night:\n\n1. Will Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden attack each other, especially over health care?\n\nThe much-anticipated matchup between Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden will be front and center Thursday night. The two have yet to be on a debate stage together, and with Ms. Warren closing in on Mr. Biden in polls, any direct engagement between them\u2014especially on health care\u2014will be closely watched.\n\nMr. Biden supports building on the Affordable Care Act by adding a government-run insurance plan known as a public option, while Ms. Warren has said she supports Mr. Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All legislation. She hasn\u2019t released her own health care plan, despite a host of nuanced policy rollouts on other issues, and hasn\u2019t yet been pressed by other candidates on the details of what she would do as president on that topic.\n\nA Healthy Debate Where candidates stand on health care options: Supports moving quickly to Medicare for All Supports a buy in/public option Sanders Warren Harris Yang Biden Buttigieg Booker Castro Also support ending or sharply curtailing private health insurance Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke Supports moving quickly to Medicare for All Supports a buy in/public option Sanders Warren Harris Yang Biden Buttigieg Booker Castro Also support ending or sharply curtailing private health insurance Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke Supports moving quickly to Medicare for All Supports a buy in/public option Sanders Warren Harris Yang Biden Buttigieg Booker Castro Also support ending or sharply curtailing private health insurance Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke Supports moving quickly to Medicare for All Sanders Warren Harris Yang Also support ending or sharply curtailing private health insurance Supports a buy in/public option Biden Buttigieg Booker Castro Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke\n\n2. How will Biden\u2019s series of gaffes affect him?\n\nMr. Biden has had an error-heavy summer on the campaign trail, which could become a bigger problem now that his Democratic opponents are more openly targeting him for criticism. Most recently, he falsely claimed that he opposed the Iraq war the \u201cmoment it started,\u201d though he voted to authorize the 2003 invasion of Iraq. A campaign adviser later said Mr. Biden \u201cmisspoke.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president has had lackluster debate performances so far. As he continues to portray himself as the person who can beat President Trump, his Democratic opponents could use his gaffes against him\u2014or get even more fodder\u2014on the debate stage.\n\n3. Will Democrats lay off the Obama administration?\n\nSome Democrats on the debate stage in July were critical of former President Obama\u2019s policies on immigration and trade, which they tried to tie to Mr. Biden. Their comments annoyed some members of the Obama administration, who said Democratic contenders were doing a disservice to the party by criticizing a popular former president.\n\nIn late June, former Vice President Joseph Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Kamala Harris spoke during the second Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign.

Ahead of the debate, Mr. Castro, one of the candidates who criticized the former president\u2019s immigration record, positioned himself in New Hampshire as the candidate most capable of reassembling and building on the Obama coalition.\n\n4. Is punching up a good break-out strategy for lower-polling candidates?\n\nRecent polling suggests there is a clear top tier\u2014Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders\u2014who are polling in the double digits, while the rest of the candidates are struggling to break out of the low- to mid-single digits. Thursday night\u2019s debate will give the lower-polling candidates another chance to have a memorable moment on a national stage.\n\nIn the previous debates, candidates in need of that moment\u2014including Ms. Harris, Mr. Booker and Mr. Castro\u2014have attacked others on stage to stand out. But the boosts were short-lived.\n\nAlready, some candidates have suggested they will present a more unifying message this time. Ms. Harris, for example, will focus on defeating President Trump and \u201cunifying Americans around solutions to our common challenges,\u201d campaign spokesman Ian Sams said.\n\nMr. Booker told reporters last weekend in New Hampshire when asked about the line between personal attacks and policy critiques that no one should tolerate cheap shots. \u201cI think pointing out differences is OK,\u201d he said.\n\n5. Will proposals about gun buybacks divide the field?\n\nA series of mass shootings in August left dozens dead and has Democrats pushing for changes to gun laws. Although most of the presidential candidates are in agreement on certain measures such as universal background checks, the debate could highlight differences.\n\nOnly a few contenders\u2014including Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Mr. Booker\u2014have gone as far as to call for requiring owners to sell their assault weapons to the government. \u201cI have yet to meet an owner of an AR-15 who thinks it\u2019s OK that we have these kinds of mass killings in this country,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said in New Hampshire last weekend.\n\nOthers, such as Mr. Castro, have stopped short of backing a mandatory buyback program. \u201cI\u2019m willing to support a voluntary buyback program, and I\u2019m willing to hear the arguments on mandatory, but I at least support a voluntary buyback,\u201d Mr. Castro said last weekend.\n\nWrite to Tarini Parti at Tarini.Parti@wsj.com and Eliza Collins at eliza.collins@wsj.com.", "description": "The winnowing phase of the Democratic primary kicks into high gear Thursday in Houston when the top presidential candidates debate together for the first time.", "authors": ["Tarini Parti", "Jesse Naranjo", "Eliza Collins", "Tarini.Parti Wsj.Com", "Jesse.Naranjo Wsj.Com", "Eliza.Collins Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106229/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
