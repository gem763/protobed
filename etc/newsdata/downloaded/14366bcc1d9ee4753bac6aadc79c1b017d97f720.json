Government ministers have already withdrawn plans to tax WhatsApp calls, which sparked the revolt, and pledged to impose no new levies on ordinary people in the 2020 budget.\n\nThose promises have so far done little to appease protesters who took to the streets for a fifth day Monday saying they would settle for nothing less than a wholesale change to a political system based on sectarian power-sharing and the removal of a political elite they say has built its power base and lined its pockets by exploiting poverty and differences.\n\nThe stakes are high for Lebanon, which straddles the region\u2019s geopolitical fault-lines and has often been a proxy battleground for the Middle East\u2019s broader conflicts. The 15-year civil war ended in 1990 but still haunts a country where the warlords became the rulers and have remained in power ever since. It is that class that protesters say has plundered the state, leaving it unable to provide basic services, including electricity, and close to bankruptcy.\n\nHighlighting the depth of public anger, the revolt for the first time cut across sectarian and political lines, with demonstrators taking aim at both local lawmakers and senior politicians in a way that was, until recently, unimaginable.\n\n\u201cWe want 24-hour electricity, 24-hour water, free hospitals for the poor, free good schools. We pay taxes and we get nothing and they want to increase them as well?\u201d said Iman, who runs a snack bar in Beirut, declining to give her full name for privacy. \u201cWe want a new generation, not the old faces. Get rid of the sectarian system. Let Lebanese just be a Lebanese and not have to beg a sectarian leader for help securing their most basic needs.\u201d\n\nHow Lebanon\u2019s Unrest Is Both New and More of the Same: QuickTake\n\nClock Ticks\n\nTime is not on Lebanon\u2019s side, however. One of the most indebted countries in the world, it needs to find fresh sources of funding as the foreign inflows on which it has traditionally relied have dried up.\n\nYields on Lebanon\u2019s $1 billion of bonds due in May 2029 have risen 70 basis points in the last two trading sessions to 13.4%. Yields on its 2021 dollar bonds surged for a second day, adding more than one percentage point to 21.88% as of 9:37 a.m. in London. The cost of insuring its debt against default was steady, with credit-default swaps trading at 1,251 after a jump of 76 basis points on Friday, the most in a month.\n\nRegional instability has made it harder to revive an economy already struggling to absorb more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees who\u2019ve fled the war next door. As weaker oil prices hit growth in the oil-exporting Gulf, foreign job markets that once absorbed Lebanese graduates have closed. Complaints from young people unable to find work at home or abroad have been emblematic of the revolt.\n\nHariri, a Sunni Muslim, has traditionally been backed by Saudi Arabia, but the kingdom has withheld support as the influence of Iranian-backed Hezbollah over the government has grown. It has ignored Hariri\u2019s pleas for financial aid to avert a looming debt crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah, a Shi\u2019ite Muslim armed group with a powerful political wing, has seen its own income dwindle as the U.S. sanctions some of its members as well as its main backer, Iran. With financial pressures rising, Hezbollah and its allies have opposed Hariri\u2019s push to impose taxes and take other measures they fear will harm low income families that form a large section of their support base.\n\nPolitical differences have also delayed plans to restructure Lebanon\u2019s electricity sector, which loses $2 billion a year. But in the absence of such reforms, Lebanon has been unable to unlock about $11 billion in international aid pledges made at a donor conference in Paris 18 months ago.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund projects Lebanon\u2019s current-account deficit will reach almost 30% of gross domestic product by the end of this year. It predicts that economic growth, stagnant at 0.3% in 2018, would continue to be weak. Public debt is projected to increase to 155% of GDP by the end of 2019.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Lebanese officials are scrambling to finalize an economic plan to avert a financial meltdown and quell days of nationwide demonstrations demanding the ouster of a political class blamed for entrenched corruption and worsening living standards.The government began a meeting Monday morning", "authors": ["Lin Noueihed", "Dana Khraiche"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
