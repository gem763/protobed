The reports are a sampling of analysts\u2019 thinking; they should not be considered the views or recommendations of Barron\u2019s. Some of the reports\u2019 issuers have provided, or hope to provide, investment-banking or other services to the companies being analyzed.\n\nComcast MCSA-Nasdaq\n\nOutperform Price $45.52 on Sept. 4\n\nby Oppenheimer\n\nComcast is trading at its lowest relative price/earnings ratio to the market ever and its highest free-cash-flow yield (our 9% estimate versus the Street\u2019s 8%) and dividend yield relative to Treasuries. It will delever from three times Ebitda to two times within two years, driven by very strong broadband growth and margins, but we also expect good margin expansion from Sky and NBCUniversal.\n\nComcast will have easier comps in 2020, with two very significant events: the summer Olympics and U.S. elections. Film also has easier comps and should benefit from new installments in both Minions and the Fast and Furious franchises. Broadband/Sky are seeing stronger incremental margins.\u2026Comcast is executing well and is highly diversified, with the ability to slash expenses to improve margins. Video subscribers are a concern going forward. However, broadband is as strong as ever, with rising prices and very high incremental margins with declining capital intensity. This is the primary driver of free-cash-flow growth. Price target: $54.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell NYSE-RDS/A\n\nMarket Perform $55.89 on Sept. 5\n\nby Cowen\n\nWe are downgrading Royal Dutch Shell from Outperform to Market Perform, reducing our price target from $69 to $60. RDS has peer-leading exposure to international gas prices; lower forecast prices through year-end 2020 could limit FCF [free cash flow] growth. Cash generation through 2020 post-divestments could fall $8 billion short of shareholder returns, with dividend increase unlikely before 2021.\n\nWeak international gas prices could persist through at least 2020, weighing on RDS\u2019 results, given its peer-leading exposure at 30% upstream production. The stock has been flat, year to date, on a total-return basis, in line with its European peers and modestly worse than the U.S. integrated oil group. Its 6.7% dividend yield compares with a 5.2% average since 2000 and a 6% average since 2010, implying limited compensation for its $10 billion a year repurchase program. The company doesn\u2019t expect to increase its dividend until after completing the program by year-end 2020. We see stable, $15 billion annual FCF through 2021, after factoring in our updated gas prices and assuming $60 Brent, resulting in a net cash outflow of $8 billion post-divestments to fund the repurchase program through 2020.\n\nApple AAPL-Nasdaq\n\nOverweight Price $209.19 on Sept. 5\n\nby Piper Jaffray\n\nWe expect Apple to ship 5G iPhones in second-half of 2020. While early to be talking about devices that will not hit the market for over a year, the 5G iPhone\u2019s integration into the investor narrative around Apple shares has already begun. Our second survey of more than 1,000 U.S. iPhone owners shows that 23% are interested in purchasing a 5G iPhone, up from 18% in our June 2019 survey. We see this as a high level of interest, given limited 5G marketing/chatter to date and the high price point suggested in our survey. Looking at the remainder of fiscal year 2019, we expect limited excitement around this year\u2019s iPhones (to be announced on Sept. 10), however, as long as services and non-iPhone devices continue to perform well, this should tide investors over until anticipation for 5G iPhones intensifies. We are maintaining our Overweight rating and $243 price target.\n\nThe last \u201cmajor\u201d iPhone cycle was the 6 Plus, which drove 52% Y/Y iPhone revenue growth in fiscal-year 2015; even the Nov. 17 release of the iPhone X drove 17% growth in fiscal 2018. The launch of 5G iPhones (enabling materially faster data transfer) should drive upgrades, especially as the 5G infrastructure improves and apps leveraging 5G permeate the App store. We are conservatively modeling 2% Y/Y iPhone revenue growth in fiscal year 2021 (in line with consensus).\n\nKraft Heinz KHC-Nasdaq\n\nUnderperform $25.52 on Sept. 3\n\nby Credit Suisse\n\nKraft Heinz\u2019s new CEO, Miguel Patricio, hosted a meeting today with sell-side research analysts to hear their perspective and provide some more color on his approach for developing a multiyear turnaround plan for the company. Personality-wise, Patricio is the type of CEO we like to meet: humble, good-humored, and eager to listen\u2014but also strategic and assertive. However, we didn\u2019t hear anything to alter our concern about the significant challenges facing the company longer term and the likelihood of a dividend cut in the near term.\n\nFitch and Standard & Poor\u2019s have reduced their outlooks on Kraft and issued warnings that if the company\u2019s Ebitda stays at $6 billion, it will need to make significant asset sales to pay down debt and/or cut its dividend in order to meet their thresholds for an investment-grade rating. Patricio\u2019s decision to pause asset sales while withdrawing Ebitda guidance was the primary catalyst for the outlook revisions. Price target: $23.\n\nTo be considered for this section, material should be sent to Research@barrons.com.", "description": "Low price and high cash flow make cable operator a buy.
