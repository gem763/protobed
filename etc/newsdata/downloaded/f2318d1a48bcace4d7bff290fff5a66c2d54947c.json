The memo, which does not reflect a \u201cverbatim transcript\u201d but is based on \u201cnotes and recollections\u201d of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.\n\nHowever, Schiff\u2019s improvised version of the call was exaggerated, apparently for dramatic effect.\n\nREAD THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT\n\n\u201cI have a favor I want from you,\u201d Schiff said while appearing to read from a paper. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.\u201d\n\nSchiff later chalked his fictional summary of the controversial phone call to a joke.\n\n\u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody. The fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, \u2018If you don\u2019t understand me I\u2019m going to say it seven more times,\u2019 my point is, that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words,\u201d Schiff said.\n\n\u201cIn opening statement, Rep. Schiff makes up dialogue to represent what Trump said to Zelensky. A rough transcript of the president's words exists, and is available, but Schiff's version is more dramatic,\u201d Fox News contributor Byron York tweeted.\n\nMEDIA 'MOVE THE GOALPOSTS' AFTER RELEASE OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT\n\nConservative commentator Matt Walsh wrote that Schiff \u201cknows that a lot of people watching will think that's actually what the transcript said\u201d when it was pure fiction.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the WHOLE POINT is that the transcript DOESN'T say what Schiff just said it said,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nElise Stefanik, R-NY., later mocked the situation when it was her turn to grill Maguire\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to improvise for parody purposes like the chairman of this committee did,\u201d Stefanik said when reading the complaint. \u201cI\u2019m going to quote it directly.\u201d\n\nStefanik also took to Twitter, calling the situation \"disturbing and outrageous.\"\n\nNUNES SAYS DEMS ENLISTED 'MEDIA MOUTHPIECES' TO GIN UP 'FAKE' IMPEACHMENT GROUNDS\n\nMany others took to Twitter to condemn Schiff for the stunt:\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., came under fire on Thursday for making up his own version of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for \u201cparody\u201d purposes.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
