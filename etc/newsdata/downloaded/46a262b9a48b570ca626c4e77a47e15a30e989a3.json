Picture taken December 1, 2016. REUTERS/Thomas Peter - RC1A27DC9700\n\nMILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bernard Arnault has succumbed to Holly Golightly\u2019s allure. The French tycoon\u2019s luxury goods giant LVMH is pursuing a takeover of Tiffany & Co. Adding the jewelry chain immortalised by Audrey Hepburn to a portfolio that includes Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon would be an affordable indulgence. It would also throw down a diamond-studded gauntlet to rivals.\n\nEight years after swooping on Bulgari, Arnault appears ready to add to his jewelry collection. LVMH had to pay a 60% premium to get its hands on the Italian brand, its first significant foray into the \u201chard luxury\u201d world of watches and necklaces. Tiffany has extra scarcity value as one of the few truly public companies in an industry full of founder-controlled brands. It would also boost LVMH\u2019s presence in the United States.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the $215 billion group approached the purveyor of blue-boxed trinkets with an offer worth $14.5 billion, a 22% premium to its market value on Friday, but more than 30% above its average price in recent weeks. Though the U.S. company is likely to reject that, Arnault could afford to go higher. An offer worth $16.5 billion \u2013 equivalent to about 16 times Tiffany\u2019s expected EBITDA this year \u2013 would leave LVMH\u2019s net debt well below 2 times EBITDA.\n\nLVMH investors might swoon at such a price tag, though. Tiffany\u2019s sales are projected to grow at a lower rate than the French group\u2019s. Without significant cost savings, the return on LVMH\u2019s invested capital would be less than 4% by 2021, according to Breakingviews calculations based on Refinitiv estimates. That\u2019s well below Tiffany\u2019s 8.6% weighted average cost of capital, as estimated by Morningstar analysts.\n\nArnault might be able to get away with paying less, especially if he can charm Tiffany Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo, who previously worked at Bulgari. But rivals are unlikely to sit still. A Tiffany takeover would be a direct challenge to Richemont, owner of Cartier, which dominates the hard luxury world. It would also deprive Kering of a potential target to reduce its dependence on slowing fashion brand Gucci. \u201cNothing very bad could happen to you\u201d at Tiffany, Holly Golightly said in \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d. Shareholders in the company\u2019s potential suitors will hope she is right.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Bernard Arnault has succumbed to Holly Golightly\u2019s allure.
