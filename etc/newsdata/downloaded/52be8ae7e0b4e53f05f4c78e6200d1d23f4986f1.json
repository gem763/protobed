Local mayor Roger de Groot had said on Tuesday that the 58-year-old was not the father of the family.\n\n\"The man is still in custody and is being questioned,\" said Drenthe police spokeswoman Grietje Hartstra. \"A lot is still unclear and we are investigating exactly what happened there.\"\n\nThe family was discovered after one member, a 25-year-old man and the eldest of the siblings according to local media, sought help at a nearby cafe.\n\nIn a statement, police said they found the family in a \"small space in the house which could be locked\" and that it was unclear whether they were being held against their will.\n\nInvestigators have not commented on published reports that the family may have held apocalyptic \"end of days\" beliefs.\n\n\"There is a lot of speculation in the media about what happened, but as police we deal with facts. We still have a lot of unanswered questions,\" Hartstra said.\n\nThe mother of the children was believed to have died before the family moved to the Dutch farm in 2010, De Groot said. None of the family members was registered as a resident with the municipality, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nREMOTE SPOT\n\nThe farm is located on a secluded plot of land on the outskirts of the village, where residents speculated about how anyone could have been hidden away for so long in their tiny community without being noticed.\n\n\"It's possible here ... (it) is such a remote spot, in the middle of fields,\" said neighbour Roelie van Dijk. \"You see it can happen anywhere. Not only in a big city but also in the countryside. And perhaps even more in the countryside, where you can hide completely.\"\n\nVan Dijk said she and her husband had seen a man driving in and out of the property for years and doing construction work. He always kept the gates closed and never socialised, she said. Her husband Sjon said he once asked to see how the renovations were coming along, but the man yelled \"no\" and sped off.\n\n\"We tried to make contact, my husband just last week, with the man in the car...(But) he drove on. He went through the gates and locked them again.\"\n\nThe siblings had apparently lived in makeshift rooms inside the farm and survived partly on vegetables and animals from a secluded garden on the property, local TV RTV Drenthe reported.
