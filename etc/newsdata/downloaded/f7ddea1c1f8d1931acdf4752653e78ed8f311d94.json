Her long braid swished and swayed for the rest of the routine, occasionally hitting her in the face.\n\n\u201cWhen I was coming up to floor, I checked my bun and thought about whether I should re-do it, but I decided not to,\u201d Melnikova said. \u201cThe rest of the floor routine, I was just thinking about my hair, that it didn't get in my eye or anything because I know how much it can bother you.\u201d\n\nLike most gymnasts, Melnikova usually wears her hair up during competitions. It\u2019s never come loose before, but Melnikova said she\u2019s long feared it could \u2013 which is why she braids her hair before putting it up.\n\n\u201cIf it was in training, I would have stopped and changed it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut here I couldn't stop, so I was just thinking about it. I hoped it wouldn't get in my eye.\u201d\n\nMid-routine hair change is what we came to #Stuttgart2019 for. \ud83d\udc51 pic.twitter.com/J0HcKMhL2t \u2014 Pamchenko Twist (@Pamchenkova) October 5, 2019\n\nAt least the bright blue scrunchie that was wrapped around the base of the bun stayed put. Had it come off, Melnikova could have slipped on it. Instead, she waited until her score -- a 14.1 -- posted, then re-did her hair.\n\nMelnikova is second in the all-around standings, though Simone Biles and the Americans haven\u2019t competed yet.", "description": "Angela Melnikova has top qualifying score on floor exercise so far at world gymnastics championships despite her hair falling from bun during routine.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
