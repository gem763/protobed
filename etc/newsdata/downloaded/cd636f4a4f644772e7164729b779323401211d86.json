According to the The Hartford Courant, he posted a $500,000 bond and was released Wednesday evening.\n\nUpon his release, Dulos apparently made no mention of his estranged wife, who has been missing since May 24, telling the Courant, \u201cIt\u2019s an exhausting fight, I love my children, that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nIn an arrest warrant application detailing the evidence behind his arrest, investigators said Dulos \u201c has declined to cooperate with this investigation in any way\u201d since refusing to provide an interview with police the day after Jennifer Dulos went missing.\n\nThe warrant application paints a detailed picture of what investigators say happened on the day the mother of five dropped her kids off at school only to never be seen again.\n\nAfter borrowing an employee\u2019s Toyota Tacoma, Dulos is believed to have traveled to his estranged wife\u2019s New Canaan home where he was \u201clying in wait\u201d when she returned home, the warrant application says.\n\nAt the home, investigators later found signs of a \u201cserious physical assault,\u201d including \u201cmultiple areas within the garage which tested positive for human blood as well as evidence of attempts to clean the scene,\u201d according to the arrest warrant application.\n\nSurveillance cameras in Hartford reportedly picked up a man resembling Fotis Dulos driving a large pickup truck and \u201cstopping at multiple locations to dumb garbage bags in several trash cans\u201d the night Jennifer Dulos went missing, according to the warrant application.\n\nThe 43-page document says cell phone records and surveillance footage indicate that Dulos, who was involved in a volatile divorce battle with Jennifer, drove off with her vehicle after first arriving at her home in the borrowed Toyota Tacoma that was \u201cused in the commission of the crime.\u201d When Dulos allegedly drove off in his estranged wife\u2019s car, it was believed to be carrying \u201c the body of Jennifer Dulos,\u201d the warrant application said.\n\nInvestigators reportedly learned of the role the Toyota Tacoma truck allegedly played after Pawel Gumienny, an employee of Dulos\u2019 home-development business, told them he had replaced the rear seats in the vehicle at Dulos\u2019 insistence.\n\nGumienny later told police that Dulos and his girlfriend Michelle Troconis had used his truck on the day Jennifer went missing and taken it to get washed without his knowledge or permission five days later. Over the next several days, he said Dulos became \u201cpushy\u201d about urging him to swap out the seats in the vehicle, and later asked him if he had \u201cseen anything\u201d on the day Jennifer vanished.\n\nPolice later found Dulos\u2019 blood on one of the seats in the vehicle.\n\nTroconis, who was allegedly with Dulos when he had the truck cleaned, allegedly told investigators he claimed to be cleaning up \u201ccoffee\u201d in the truck. When pressed by investigators to explain why the vehicle needed to be cleaned, however, she allegedly said the \u201cevidence\u201d presented to her by police suggests \u201c it\u2019s because the body of Jennifer at some point was in there.\u201d\n\nInvestigators also said they found \u201calibi scripts\u201d in Dulos\u2019 business office\u2014 handwritten notes that Troconis is said to have told detectives were meant to \u201chelp them remember\u201d their activities on the day Jennifer Dulos vanished. Much of the information, including alibi witnesses, turned out to be false, investigators said.\n\nNorm Pattis, Dulos' lawyer, told the Courant the arrest didn't \u201ceven rise to the level of a jab\u201d and said his client would plead not guilty. As for the new details revealed in the arrest warrant application, he told The New York Times, \u201cThere\u2019s not much here that we hadn\u2019t heard before, and I question the wisdom of these charges at this late date.\u201d\n\nDulos and Troconis were initially arrested on tampering with evidence charges in early June before released on $500,000 bail.", "description": "Investigators say a \u201cbloodlike substance\u201d was found in a truck he \u201cused in the commission of the crime\u201d\u2014a vehicle he allegedly had cleaned before insisting the seats get swapped.", "authors": ["Anna Kaplan", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_396,w_703,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567658708/ewrewrewrewrewrewr_1_s2ui7c_ofw5yf", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
