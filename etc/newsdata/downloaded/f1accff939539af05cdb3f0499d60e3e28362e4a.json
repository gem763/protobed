Rand Paul (R-KY) defended President Trump\u2019s requests to the Ukrainian president and the Chinese government to help investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden, as vice president, pushed for the firing of the then-chief prosecutor of Ukraine, who had been investigating the CEO of a company that employed his son on its board at $50,000 a month. At Biden\u2019s urging, the chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin was fired and the investigation was eventually closed.\n\nBiden, during an official work trip to China in late 2013, brought his son, who had business meetings during the trip. After the trip, a Chinese private equity fund his son was forming received a Chinese business license that brought the fund into existence.\n\nPaul told reporters Tuesday on a conference call, \u201cI\u2019m with most Americans that Hunter Biden making $50,000 a month doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. It sounds really corrupt, I think most Americans are beginning to believe that.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\nIn China it\u2019s hard to tell what is a private investment in Joe Biden and his son, and what is a government investment and obviously it\u2019d be much more worrisome if the Chinese government were involved in paying Hunter Biden for investing in his fund, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s beyond the pale of consideration because so many of the companies in China \u2026 the government retains a 50% interest in a lot of so-called private entities over there, so yeah, I think we should find out if the Chinese government made an indirect or direct investment in Joe Biden\u2019s son. I think absolutely.\n\nPaul also dismissed suggestions that it was wrong of Trump to ask Ukraine or China to get involved in U.S. politics. He said:\n\nNow people want to word this as \u2018Oh, getting involved in our political system.\u2019 Well political figures can be corrupt and it doesn\u2019t meant that just because they are a political figure we don\u2019t investigate them. And the Bidens are political figures \u2014 does that mean if you investigate them it\u2019s a campaign contribution or something ridiculous?\n\n\u201cI think political figures who commit corruption will and should be investigated. And the only way you figure out the truth of this is looking back at all records \u2013 Ukrainian records and Chinese records\u2026I am not so sure there there\u2019s some law that\u2019s broken by asking for [the] investigation of corrupt political officials and their families,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Paul defended Trump's requests to the Ukrainian president and the Chinese government to help investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Hunter-the-Biden-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
