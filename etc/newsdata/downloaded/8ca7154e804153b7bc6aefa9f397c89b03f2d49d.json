You, me, the children, our friends, their children, everybody else. Sometimes we get out: for lunch, to read or to tan, never for very long. Then we all climb back into the metaphor.\u201d Likewise, England\u2019s real Grand Union Canal becomes a conduit between the old world and the new. Antiguan Kelso Cochrane considers this, in \u201cKelso Deconstructed\u201d:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWater went with water in his mind. The green and murky lagoon behind his great aunt\u2019s house . . . stretching all the way . . . to the Potomac and the Hudson.\u201d The real Kelso Cochrane was murdered by white youth in London, and his death kicked off a race riot in 1959. Smith depicts him as a man, oblivious of his impending death, sharing creative-writing tips with his doctor via email \u2014 a 21st century mode of exchange inside a mid-century story. She blithely plays with temporality. She also plays with metaphor as a literary construct, along with other tropes like transitions, dialogue and \u201ceconomy of form.\u201d \u201cParents\u2019 Morning Epiphany\u201d reads like a creative-writing exercise torn to pieces.\n\nHer characters are children, tortured men and grown women, inside their own heads, ruminating. A drag queen makes a miscalculation in \u201cMiss Adele Among the Corsets.\u201d The narrator in \u201cBlocked\u201d is God.\n\n\u201cI was young, full of beans, I\u2019d just created beans, cars, grassland, Post-it Notes, the white rhinos, everything else . . . having replaced nothing with something.\u201d The deity happens to be depressed.\n\nDystopia meets urban myth in \u201cEscape From New York,\u201d in which Michael Jackson, Liz Taylor and Marlon Brando flee 9/11. Brett Kavanagh shares a story with Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland and Michael Brown in \u201cDowntown,\u201d as two Jamaican aunts visit New York and discuss rape and entitlement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis might look like a war between men and women, but what this really is is the last siege of a ruling class,\u201d they say. Through these women, Smith is witty and eviscerating, comparing Kavanagh to an inconsolable baby who lost his rattle. \u201cAmerica being the rattle in this analogy,\u201d the women say. \u201cHe thinks he deserves to do whatever he wants with that rattle, and women are simply a subclause in that arrangement.\u201d Sex, immigration, death and Donald Trump are other sidebars, along with animal cruelty and drug addiction.\n\nSmith has always been audacious. Her debut novel, \u201cWhite Teeth,\u201d was called an example of \u201chysterical realism.\u201d And some of these new stories do feel hysterical. They\u2019re panicked \u2014 about time, about motherhood, about the environment. The short story as a form is new for Smith, and some of these stories feel unfinished. \u201cThe Canker\u201d reads like an episode of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d but never takes off. \u201cMood\u201d is a disparate laundry list of emotional possibilities that don\u2019t really hold together, even with humor spliced in.\n\nMany of the best stories are toward the back of the collection. I found myself wanting to rearrange their order so that the final story, \u201cGrand Union,\u201d was the first. In that story, the narrator is so upset, she seeks out the ghost of her dead mother, and they hang out together on a sidewalk outside of a Chinese restaurant. Likewise, in the superb \u201cFor the King,\u201d a group of friends meet for dinner in Paris. Along the way one encounters a man with Tourette\u2019s syndrome on the train, who is loud but tolerated because \u201ceach passenger . . . reached for their earbuds, and thus entered a private world . . . there was a palpable sense of collective gratitude to technology.\u201d This is Smith at her best, integrating a compelling story line with perceptiveness and social commentary.\n\nLisa Page is co-editor of \u201cWe Wear the Mask: 15 True Stories of Passing in America.\u201d She teaches writing at George Washington University.\n\nGrand Union\n\nBy Zadie Smith\n\nPenguin Press. 256 pp. $27\n\nAD", "description": "The \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d author is witty and eviscerating in stories sprinkled with current events.", "authors": ["Lisa Page"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KPgtRM2v2f2EdipLKGOrJI0GHYg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5KCAHKXKXQI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
