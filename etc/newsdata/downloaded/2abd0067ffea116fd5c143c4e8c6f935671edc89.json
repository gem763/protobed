And why on earth not?\n\nThe kittens, five girls and one boy, were found by builders at a demolition site and handed into Oak Tree Animal Charity in Wetheral, Cumbria.\n\nCaroline Yon, the intake team leader at the charity, took on the role of foster carer and hand-reared the kittens, feeding them around the clock.\n\nShe got her dog, Skye, involved \u2013 and the connection was instant.\n\nSoon Skye began to care for the litter as if they were her own.\n\nShe cleans them, makes sure they eat, and cleans up their messes (Picture: SWNS)\n\nSkye has helped look after other young animals before, having raised two of her own litters as well as the puppies of Caroline\u2019s old dog, Dodger, and she once offered her assistance when Caroline had to take care of some orphaned lambs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dog is a total natural when it comes to parenting, grooming them, snoozing together, and patiently sitting as the kittens use her as a climbing frame.\n\nCaroline said: \u2018The kittens were starting to look a bit greasy coated as they weren\u2019t being groomed as often as they should.\n\n\u2018With six in the litter, meal times could take an hour by the time they were all fed, winded and toileted.\n\nSkye even sits patiently as the kittens use her as a climbing frame (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018Skye was a natural, she soon had their coats shining and fluffy and she was super diligent not only ensuring they toileted after every meal, but cleaning up thoroughly afterwards.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s also very calm and tolerates being used as a kitty climbing frame well.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s thought that the kittens\u2019 birth mother was feral. Staff managed to catch her and have her spayed, but she wasn\u2019t interested in the kittens so was released back into the area.\n\nFive of the kittens have now found homes, while one black kitten is looking for a family.\n\nStaff at the animal centre believe the mother cat may have been feral.\n\nCaroline, who has adopted two of the kittens herself, added: \u2018Black cats are always harder to rehome, but these are so sociable and love all the attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We have given them all names of well-known singers.\n\n\u2018Mine are called Amy Winecat and Paloma Peanut. We also have a Kitty Perry and a Shakira Sam.\u2019\n\nMORE: Blind kitten Carrot is looking for a home after being found in the streets of Prague\n\nMORE: Watch as a spiteful cat pushes its feline frenemy into a pool\n\nMORE: Justin Bieber has been slammed for splashing out on a pair of expensive exotic cats\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Skye is looking after the abandoned kittens as her own.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cats-best-frien-420933-0aa7_1570537682.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
