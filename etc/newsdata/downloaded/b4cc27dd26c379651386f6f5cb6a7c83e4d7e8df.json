There was significant bleeding around the back of his head.\"\n\nAs medics took over, Parchment watched on, before asking if they could find a pulse.\n\nWhen they said they couldn\u2019t, he said \u201cOh my God, I\u2019ve killed him\u201d, before he fell to the ground and began rolling around hysterically and crying.\n\nParchment then went back inside his home, where he was heard saying to his grandmother \"I don't know why he wanted to fight with me\".\n\nHe was still \"distressed\" when a police officer arrived and his clothing, shoes and left arm were covered in Mr Howl's blood.\n\nThe court heard that during a police interview following his arrest, Parchment had been \u201cvague\u201d about what happened and said Mr Howl had suggested they should playfight.\n\nHe told officers he was reluctant at first due to his age and bad back, but \"somehow\" they ended up on a patch of wasteland outside the property.\n\nParchment originally said he didn\u2019t know how he had connected with Mr Howl, he later admitted a single punch.\n\nGurdeep Garcha, defending, said Parchment was full of remorse for what he did, adding: \"There was no hostility between them and no reason for the violence. They were childhood friends.\n\n\"He wanted to express through me how sorry he is for the loss of his friend and the life-changing event he has visited upon Mr Howl's family.\n\n\"He understands they are unlikely to ever be able to forgive him and nobody could blame them for that.\"\n\nAs he jailed Parchment, Judge James Burbidge said Mr Howl had been three times over the legal drink drive limit and that had put him in \u201cno position to defend himself\u201d.\n\nThe judge added: \u201cYou punched him so hard, he was in reality dying at that moment.\n\n\u201cYou ended his life but you also devastated many lives.\n\n\u201cDamien Howl was much loved and had much to live for. His loss have affected many lives and will continue to do so.\"", "description": "Marcus Parchment, 42, was jailed for four years after admitting the manslaughter of pal Damien Howl in West Bromwich", "authors": ["Kelly Ashmore"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20759732.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Marcus-Parchment.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
