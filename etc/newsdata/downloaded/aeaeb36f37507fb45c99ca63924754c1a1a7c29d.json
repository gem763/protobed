It ended violently, leaving four protesters dead, including an indigenous leader.\n\nThe deaths announced on Thursday brought the overall toll in the protests to five. The first victim was hit by a vehicle on Sunday in the southern province of Azuay.\n\nStruggling to deal with an economic crisis, Moreno has accused his predecessor and ex-ally Rafael Correa along with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of an \u201cattempted coup d\u2019etat\u201d using indigenous groups.\n\nMaduro, a leftist firebrand whom Washington is seeking to oust, has denounced allegations of involvement as absurd, but praised the \u201cpopular insurrection\u201d against the IMF.", "description": "Quito (AFP) \u2013 Riot police clashed with indigenous demonstrators in Ecuador\u2019s capital on Friday as deadly protests against fuel price hikes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/80a5fc_demonstrators-in-ecuador-clash-riot-police-protest-fuel-price-hike-ordered-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
