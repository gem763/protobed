Ebony Freeman's mail man in Texas got the message loud and clear, as he understood to 'hide' her latest package underneath the new doormat\n\nThe perfect gift: Shopaholic Ebony had been gifted the mat by her friend Amanda Harper just days previously, left, and other postmen had ignored the 'instruction', right\n\nEbony shared the image, tagging her friend who had gifted her the mat.\n\n'Oh my god look! The UPS guy actually hid it under the rug,' she captioned the image, which has since been shared 48,000 times.\n\nHer friend, Amanda Harper who lives in Huntington Beach, California, had sent her the mat as a tongue-in-cheek reference to her penchant for online shopping.\n\nEbony told Good Morning America that she cracked up when she saw the postal worker's action.\n\n'I instantly laughed and the first thing I did was send [a picture] to Amanda before posting it on Facebook,' she said.\n\n'I had no clue it was going to get that much traction,' she added.\n\nShe also answered the burning question that many Facebook users had: what was in the blue plastic?\n\nIronically, it was AstroTurf for the yard - and not one of her many Amazon packages containing clothing and home wear.\n\nHowever, Ebony admitted her husband Mike 'doesn't really' get mad at the incessant packages anymore.\n\nAmazon addict: Ebony, pictured, said that her husband Mike 'doesn't really mind' that the doorbell never stops ringing thanks to her never ending Amazon purchases\n\n'I have a package a day coming from Amazon, but he thinks it's funny,' she told the outlet.\n\nThe mat in question came from an Etsy store named Crafty Indy Gal, a venture by a stay-at-home mom-of-three based in Indiana, who was thrilled to see her creation go viral.\n\nReady for the Holidays: Amanda, pictured, has her own humorous singing mat ready for the Holiday deliveries\n\nAnd as for Amanda in Huntington Beach?\n\nShe'll be keeping the delivery guys on the West Coast on their toes this Holiday season as she said she's already got her funny doormat ready: a mat that sings 'Here comes Amazon' to the tune of 'Here Comes Santa Claus'.\n\nThe mat seemed to go down a treat online.\n\nWith over 10,000 comments underneath the photo, countless people began tagging their friends and spouses.\n\n'I need this,' cried many.\n\nOthers joked how their husbands or partners had basically given up on their online shopping habits.\n\n'He's always home when the mail comes,' said one commentor. 'He's just learned to neatly stack them for me in the house.'\n\n'Don't know where we would be without our UPS men and women,' laughed another user.\n\nIn music to the ears of all commentors, the mat in question is available on Etsy for $42, in options including hide from husband, boyfriend, fiance, wife and girlfriend.", "description": "A Texas-based shopaholic has gone viral after sharing a tongue-in-cheek photo of the mailman adhering to her doormat's request that he 'please hide packages from husband', pictured", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/21/19758120-0-image-a-87_1571170999889.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
