The number of working-age people in Japan compared to those over the age of 65 is 1.8, the lowest in the world, according to a 2019 United Nations report.\n\nJapan is the world\u2019s second-largest market for innovative drugs such as gene-based therapies and cutting-edge cancer drugs. As a wealthy country with one of the fastest ageing societies, it remains an attractive market for global pharmaceutical makers.\n\nJapan is also a major center for pharma research, producing drugs such as Opdivo, a blockbuster cancer drug licensed globally by Bristol-Myers.\n\nThe rules announced last year evaluate drugs and their makers for innovation to determine how much the government will pay for treatments.\n\nThe rules would also subject drugs to annual reviews starting from 2021, as opposed to biannual reviews now. Caforio said he met with senior government officials to press for more discussion on the regulations.\n\n\u201cThese decisions could impact whether the strong investment patterns in Japan continue and whether new medicines are rapidly available for Japanese patients in the future,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Japan\u2019s \u201coverly restrictive\u201d drug pricing policies risk diverting foreign direct investment to China and other markets, the chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb said.
