Researchers filmed nearly 300 people preparing a meal of chicken thighs and a salad in a test kitchen the same way they did at home and found that those who washed or rinsed the bird were leaving a trail of bacteria around the kitchen. In real life, that\u2019s a situation that could make you or others sick.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe study included only people who said they had washed chicken the last time they prepared it. Its main purpose was \u00adto test whether sending participants food safety messages before they came to the test kitchen, telling them not to wash chicken, would prevent them from doing so. But as part of the study, the researchers also spiked the chicken with a harmless strain of bacteria that acted like salmonella, then they traced where the bacteria went during the meal prep.\n\nBeing told not to wash chicken did stop the majority of people from doing so \u2014 only 7 percent of the people who got an email message washed the chicken during the test, compared with 61 percent of those who didn\u2019t get an email.\n\nFor those who washed the chicken, 60 percent had bacteria in their sink afterward; 14 percent still had bacteria in the sink after cleaning it. And 26 percent of them transferred bacteria to the salad they were preparing, compared with 20 percent of those who didn\u2019t wash.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lettuce contamination caused by the people who didn\u2019t wash their chicken probably came from improper handwashing, the researchers said. Just 25 percent of all the people in the study washed their hands every time they should have during meal prep, and only 2 percent did so correctly. The most common mistake was not rubbing their hands with soap for at least 20 seconds.\n\n\u201cNot following proper food safety precautions when you\u2019re preparing chicken is risky,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThe chances are high that chicken you buy is contaminated with harmful bacteria, such as salmonella and campylobacter, and I always assume so when I\u2019m prepping it.\u201d\n\nStaying safe\n\nTo stay safe, follow these meal prep steps:\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf Wash your hands before you start cooking. Use soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds \u2014 the time it would take you to sing the ABC song in your head \u2014 rinse, then dry your hands on a clean kitchen towel or paper towel. Only 4 percent of the people in this study performed all these steps correctly before they started to prep the meal.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf Prep foods you\u2019ll eat raw before prepping raw poultry or meat. If salad greens and other foods you\u2019re not going to cook are taken care of first (and removed from the prep area), there\u2019s less chance of contaminating them with harmful bacteria, the USDA says.\n\n\u25cf Do not wash the chicken. \u201cYou won\u2019t remove salmonella or other bacteria that can cause illness if it is there, and, as this study shows, you only increase the risk of contaminating your kitchen or other food you\u2019re preparing,\u201d Rogers says. If there\u2019s anything on the chicken you want to remove, pat it with a damp paper towel and then wash your hands immediately, the USDA advises.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf Every time you touch raw meat, wash your hands afterward. \u201cWashing or rinsing raw meat and poultry can increase your risk as bacteria spreads around your kitchen, but not washing your hands for 20 seconds immediately after handling those raw foods is just as dangerous,\u201d says Carmen Rottenberg, administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf Take care with kitchen utensils. Don\u2019t use the same cutting board, knife, plate or other utensils you used for raw meat on other foods. If you do, be sure to clean and sanitize the utensil before using it on the other food.\n\n\u25cf Use a food thermometer. \u201cThorough cooking is the only way to make sure that meat or poultry is safe to eat, and you can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s done by looking at it,\u201d Rogers says. Poultry should be cooked to 165 degrees \u2014 whole, parts or ground. Beef, pork and lamb should reach 145 degrees for roasts, steaks and chops, and 160 degrees for ground meat.\n\nAD\n\nCopyright 2019, Consumer Reports Inc.\n\nThe Big Number: 48 million cases of food poisoning in the U.S.\n\nSalmonella risk: \u2018don\u2019t kiss or snuggle hedgehogs,\u2019 CDC warns\n\nHelpful CDC tips on how best to avoid food poisonings\n\nConsumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world.
