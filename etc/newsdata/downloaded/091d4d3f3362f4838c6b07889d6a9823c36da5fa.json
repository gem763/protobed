Following the crash, the Model S caught fire and then exploded while in slow-moving evening traffic.\n\nThe state-owned TV network, citing a law enforcement source, said the Model S was likely in Autopilot mode and couldn\u2019t identify the tow truck that was ahead of it.\n\nThis incident isn\u2019t the first to involve the electric-carmaker\u2019s Autopilot system. In March, a 50-year-old man was killed when his Tesla Model 3 collided with a tractor-trailer in Florida. The National Transportation Safety Board said in its report that the driver turned on the Autopilot 10 seconds prior to the crash and that the vehicle did not detect his hands on the steering wheel at the time of impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla Model 3 with extensive roof damage photographed postcrash at tow yard. (NTSB)\n\nA Tesla Model X crashed into a barrier on a California highway in March 2018, resulting in the death of its driver. The NTSB said the Autopilot feature was enabled at the time the incident occurred. During the crash, the Tesla\u2019s battery was \u201cbreached\u201d and in the aftermath, the vehicle caught fire.\n\nTwo of the first reported deadly accidents involving the Autopilot feature occurred in 2016. In May of that year, a 40-year-old man was killed when the Model S he was driving collided with a semi-truck that was making a turn. The roof of the Tesla struck the bottom of the trailer as it passed underneath, then went off the road and hit two fences and a power pole, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nIn January, a 23-year-old died when the Model S they were driving collided with a truck while traveling on a highway in China.

The Tesla is reportedly believed to have been on Autopilot mode at the time of the accident.\n\n\u201cWhen it was approaching the road sweeper, the car didn\u2019t put on the brake or avoid it,\u201d a police officer said in a CCTV (China\u2019s government-owned news channel) report, cited by the New York Times. \u201cInstead, it crashed right into it.\u201d\n\nTesla did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment at the time of publication.", "description": "This incident isn\u2019t the first to involve the electric-carmaker\u2019s Autopilot system.", "authors": ["Matthew Kazin"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/05/0/0/2018-05-23T110729Z_1_LYNXNPEE4M0TT_RTROPTP_4_TESLA-MODEL-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
