He denies the charge.\n\nHis alleged victim told Hull Crown Court she was repeatedly assaulted and threatened by 58-year-old Gillyon after they met online and started a relationship at the beginning of 2018.\n\nThe prosecutor told the court: 'The relationship began well but as it progressed it deteriorated. He was prone to violent outbursts.'\n\nDuring a holiday in Australia, Gillyon 'made a makeshift noose out of a towel' and tried to strangle the woman, the court heard.\n\nThe healthcare worker, who gave evidence from behind a screen, said: 'He grabbed a towel and swung it round. He strangled me with it, hanging on the floor.\n\n'I just saw him swinging the towel round, like tubular, and then he put it around my neck. I was hanging on the floor.'\n\n'[He] kept saying he was so sorry, he wouldn't do it again,' the woman said. She also said she was 'a long way from home' and 'scared because there was nowhere for me to go'.\n\nHe threatened to kill the woman with a knife and intimated he would strangle her with a towel, prosecutors said. He denies coercive behaviour in a relationship\n\nAfter they returned home, Gillyon pushed the woman over in their front room, causing her to hit her head and suffer severe shoulder pain.\n\n'I had to have time off work for that to heal because I couldn't do anything,' she told the court. She told colleagues she had fallen over a suitcase, she said.\n\nShe later had to be off work again when Gillyon pushed her out of his front door leading to her breaking bones in her foot, the court heard.\n\nProsecutor Adam Walker said, in another alleged incident, Mr Gillyon armed himself with a 'fish-gutting' knife, straddled the complainant and held it to her throat, saying: 'I'm going to kill you. I'm going to f****** kill you.'\n\nHe discarded the knife and began strangling the woman, the court heard.\n\n'She believed she was going to die,' Mr Walker said.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "The woman gave evidence at the trial of Peter Gillyon, of Hull, who is accused of controlling or coercive behaviour in a relationship.
