The currency has declined over 5% since May.\n\nWooing global investors has become a priority for China since the outbreak of the debilitating trade war last year. U.S. companies, in particular, have become the focus of a tug of war between Beijing and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has exhorted American firms to leave China.\n\nThe advisor, who declined to be identified, brushed aside Trump's \"pull-out\" directive as \"wishful thinking\", arguing that foreign investors would gravitate toward China's huge market potential and massive consumer base.\n\nBut the steady decline in both China's trade surpluses and direct mainland investments by foreign companies show why Beijing should be pursuing foreign money.\n\nHigher tariffs and growing protectionism mean China will get less and less dollar proceeds from trade, said Wang Peng, an economist at China Development Securities. \"If you want to keep a high level of investment in China, you need foreign inflows.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTWIN DEFICITS\n\nIt's an uphill battle.\n\nSince China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, foreign money has poured into the fast-growing export powerhouse, keeping the yuan on an uninterrupted uptrend for more than a decade while inflating the country's forex reserves.\n\nBut that trend has changed, and China is now staring at possible deficits in both its capital and current accounts.\n\nChina's surplus in the current account, which includes mainly trade in goods and services, has been shrinking every year since 2015, hitting a 15-year-low of $49.1 billion last year.\n\nCary Yeung, Head of Greater China debt at Pictet Asset Management, said it's natural for China to turn into a net importer of capital as it reduces economic reliance on exports, consumes more and therefore runs a current account deficit.\n\n\"When that happens, the country will have to finance that deficit by borrowing more from abroad.\"\n\nAware of this looming challenge, Beijing is doubling down on its efforts to lure portfolio inflows and open up its vast financial sector.\n\nOver the past month, senior Chinese officials met publicly, or privately, with visiting senior executives from at least four top U.S. financial institutions. They include Citi Group chief Michael Corbat, BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink and Fidelity International's Asia Pacific ex-Japan head Rajeev Mittal.\n\nTuesday's scrapping of quotas on the two schemes - known as QFII and RQFII - is on top of drastic reforms that led to global index publishers such as MSCI and FTSE Russell agreeing to add China stocks and bonds into their global benchmarks.\n\nGrowth in the stickier foreign direct investment (FDI), however, has been trending lower. Net FDI, as per Nomura estimates, will more than halve this year to $40.3 billion.\n\nBen Cavender, Managing Director of consultancy China Market Research Group (CMR), said that although it would take time for big global firms to diversify part of their capacity out of China if the trade war drags on, smaller players will more likely shut their China business.\n\n\"Any time you have government policy frictions like this, it tends to slow down FDI and so I think that's the reality. The other reality is that the Chinese economy is slowing down, and so is the return on investment,\" he said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - As the Sino-U.S. trade war drags on, Beijing is throwing its door wide open to foreign investors as concerns grow over declining exports, capital flight and persistent yuan weakness.
