It included talking points to rebut expected criticisms from voters or reporters, such as the limited number of visits she\u2019s made to the first-in-the-nation primary state and her lackluster poll results.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t traveled to New Hampshire as frequently as some of your Democratic rivals,\u201d the memo, titled \"Briefing and Talking Points,\" said. \u201cIs the state a priority for your campaign?\u201d\n\nHarris has struggled to break out of single digits in nationwide and New Hampshire polling over the past several weeks. In a CBS News poll released Sunday, she placed fifth in New Hampshire behind Pete Buttigieg and was 20 points behind frontrunner Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe document had several pages of talking points, including: \u201cNH absolutely a priority for my campaign \u2014 excited to be back for the convention and other events around the state,\u201d and, \u201cNote: Recent polling- Boston Globe/Suffolk (8/1-8/4) Biden 21%, Sanders 17%, Warren 14%, YOU 8%\u201d\n\nIn a section called \u201cPath To Victory \u2014 Summer Slump?\u201d the first talking point is simply: \u201cFully intend to win.\u201d\n\nHarris sent a fundraising email to supporters using similar language the same day the memo was written.\n\n\u201cAugust was a rough month for fundraising and we barely scraped by hitting our goal,\u201d the email said. \u201cWe expected to come out of the \u2018summer slump\u2019 this month, but the first days of September have proven even more difficult for fundraising than we expected.\u201d\n\nStaff urged her to key in on her budding infrastructure in Iowa, New Hampshire and California.\n\n\u201cLots of voters are starting to tune in right after Labor Day,\u201d the memo said. \u201cPerspective \u2014 more debates ahead of us than behind us.\u201d\n\nHarris campaign spokesman Ian Sams called the document a \u201crun of the mill\u201d event briefing predicting questions from reporters that\u2019s typical in campaigns.\n\n\u201cShe is competing hard in New Hampshire and taking nothing for granted in the state.\u201d Sams said. \u201cWe are grateful for the support and advice given to Senator Harris by people across New Hampshire, including key activists, elected officials, and leaders, and appreciate how much wisdom folks are sharing about the primary.\"\n\nHarris spent most of Friday and Saturday in the state and indeed was asked about a perceived lack of emphasis she is putting on the state. In response to questions from the media, Harris said she planned to spend more time here.\n\n\"New Hampshire and the people of New Hampshire really do represent the bellwether of who we are as a country,\" she said in one interview.\n\nAhead of a private meeting with Martha Fuller Clarke, the 77-year-old grande dame of the state Senate, Harris\u2019 staff reminded her the campaign has made several donations totaling $1,750 to Clarke\u2019s reelection. Clarke is a key player every campaign has been trying to land an endorsement from as she serves as vice chair of the state party and an automatic delegate to the party\u2019s national convention next July. It noted the two had never met, but Harris interacted with Clarke\u2019s husband, Geoff.\n\n\u201cShe and her husband are big donors to democratic [sic] candidates and causes,\u201d it said. It\u2019s an understatement about the wealthy, well-connected couple who have already maxed out their donations to several federal candidates inside and outside the state.\n\nThe memo also provided a never-before-seen list of party influencers Harris is trying to woo.\n\nMost recently, Harris had dinner in July with Bill Shaheen, another automatic delegate who is married to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). She\u2019s also had one-on-one lunches with Joyce Craig, the first female mayor of Manchester, and state Sen. Martha Hennessey, whose district includes Dartmouth College and Hanover, one of the strongest bastions of Democratic voters in the state.\n\nThe briefing document also laid out potential responses to questions on her Medicare for All plans, gun control, climate change and mental health care for veterans. And it included notes on her stump speech and biographical information: that she\u2019s a mother and fought for civil rights, for instance. It had a reminder to bring up the oft-told story of how her mom was five feet tall \u201cbut after meeting her, you\u2019d have thought she was 7 feet tall.\u201d\n\nIt included information about every event she participated in over her previous four trips to New Hampshire, including a one-on-one interview with a local anchor from the state\u2019s only TV station. Veteran WMUR Political Director Adam Sexton, who is covering his fourth primary, offered a piece of advice:\n\n\u201cIn May, Sexton gave YOU the advice to continue visiting New Hampshire because of the strong reception YOU have received in YOUR trips to the state,\u201d it said.\n\n", "description": "A briefing memo left behind at a New Hampshire restaurant and obtained by POLITICO reveals the issues her staff expected her to be grilled on.", "authors": ["Trent Spiner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zXWT8XF_dAOOlUhes69lbA--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/9976bb4e6adb7bae6df24fef57c1c1d7", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
