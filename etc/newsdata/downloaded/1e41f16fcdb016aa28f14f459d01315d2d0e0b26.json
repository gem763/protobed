That is, unless you're discussing their flags.\n\n\n\nThe two countries, situated in separate continents, share very few historical or geographical links. They don't even have an embassy in each other's country.\n\nAside from slight variations in colour shading, their flags appear identical - an observation that Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to have discovered and shared with Twitter.\n\nWhy aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t more people talking about this!? pic.twitter.com/iUFIBcDQrp \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2019\n\nAccording to online encyclopedia Britannica, Romania initially displayed a flag with horizontal stripes of blue, yellow, and red, before settling on its current vertical design in 1861.\n\nChad, meanwhile, didn't achieve independence from France until 1959, when it decided on its own flag design.\n\nThe country initially considered a green, yellow, and red design, but quickly discovered Mali had already taken the same pattern. It then swapped the green for the blue to inadvertently fly a flag that was almost identical to Romania's. The three colours; however, represent the country's rivers (blue), desert (yellow) and the blood of its independence martyrs (red).\n\nChad's flag is not the only one to resemble other flags. Here are some other examples of similar-looking flags.\n\nThe flag of Mali, the country Chad tried to avoid copying, is similar to Senegal's - a single green star in the middle appears to separate the two flags. Guinea's also replicates Mali's design, but is reversed.\n\nIndonesia and Monaco both fly two horizontal stripes: red over white. Poland similarly flies white over red.\n\nIreland and Cote d'ivoire share the same design, but is flipped on the flagpole.\n\n#ColombiaVsIvoryCoast Ireland and Cote d'Ivoire are not the only countries with similar flags - here are some more: pic.twitter.com/83xly7bkFy \u2014 Irish Foreign Ministry (@dfatirl) June 19, 2014\n\nAll of these similarities may have stemmed from coincidence, but other flags have a specific reason for slight variations to a theme.\n\nEcuador, Venezuela, and Colombia all sport the same coloured horizontal stripes, but that's because they used to be part of the same country of Gran Colombia, which dissolved in 1822, according to Britannica.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk turned to Twitter to question why countries like Chad and Romania have almost identical flags.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2387/93ce1ae43286468f94b3f97f3d4d5b3e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
