The move was a response to the most recent episode of the Comedy Central series, \"Band in China,\" which mocked Hollywood for its tendency to shape content to avoid offending China and its censors.\n\nHours after the \"South Park\" scrubbing, the show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, issued a statement with a faux apology about the ban \u2014 and a possible warning.\n\nLike the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts.

MTV denied this, claiming they had failed to get permission to show the Mexican flag on TV. A year later several parts of a \u201cSouth Park\u201d video game were censored in Europe and Australia.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "\"South Park\" banned in China", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/South-Park-S23-e02-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
