Is he even trying to? Will he delay Brexit? Will he take Britain out without a deal?\n\nThe U.K. is finishing the week with more questions about Brexit than answers. Here\u2019s what we know.\n\nWhat\u2019s London Proposing Now?\n\nJohnson wants to take the U.K. out of the European Union\u2019s customs union, but leave Northern Ireland in the bloc\u2019s single market for manufactured and agricultural products. This would require two frontiers: A regulatory one in the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern Ireland and a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBut both countries are committed to avoiding any infrastructure on the land boundary they share. To get around that, the U.K. wants to rely on technology and trusted trader programs to police the border.\n\nThe problem is that physical checks on goods traversing the two countries will still have to take place somewhere. Johnson\u2019s plan would also require the agreement of Stormont, the Northern Ireland Assembly -- which hasn\u2019t met for almost three years.\n\nCould It Get Through Parliament?\n\nProbably. In January, a majority of MPs supported what was known as the \u201cBrady Amendment,\u201d which proposed a similar, technical solution to the Irish border problem and the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Johnson\u2019s administration, has welcomed the plan.\n\nSignificantly, several of the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d -- Tory Members of Parliament who have refused to vote for any previous Brexit deal -- have also got on board. There were signs at the Conservative Party conference this week that they fear losing Brexit altogether if Johnson can\u2019t get a deal by Oct. 31. This seems to have pushed them into line.\n\nOn the other wing of the party, most of the MPs that Johnson expelled last month should still vote for a deal. Among them will almost certainly be Rory Stewart, who has quit the Conservative Party and plans to leave Parliament and run for London Mayor.\n\nWhat\u2019s the EU Response?\n\nUnimpressed. The EU says it will stand with Ireland, whose prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has ruled out any kind of hard border.\n\nDublin has given Johnson 10 days to move further, or it says it will shift the discussion to the question of whether to extend Britain\u2019s EU membership again.\n\nIs This Johnson\u2019s Final Offer?\n\nYes -- if you believe what Johnson\u2019s officials said in press release on Tuesday evening. No -- if you believe what Johnson said in a letter to the EU on Wednesday, when he described his proposal as a \u201cbroad landing zone.\u201d\n\nAccording to two people familiar with his plans, he is open to the idea of keeping Northern Ireland and possibly the whole U.K. in the EU\u2019s customs union for a strictly time-limited period. But the Irish have rejected that idea.\n\nWhat Happens Now?\n\nJohnson plans to meet Varadkar next week and hold talks with other EU leaders. Meanwhile his negotiator David Frost is involved in technical talks in Brussels, trying to find a way through.\n\nWhat Has to Happen For A Deal?\n\nThe two sides will need to reach agreement on the issues of customs checks and consent. On the first, Ireland would have to accept what it has said it won\u2019t -- a land border -- and put Varadkar at risk of being thrown out of office.\n\nOr Johnson would have to throw the DUP overboard, and accept a border in the Irish Sea. In doing so, he would risk losing the support of the Spartans, meaning he couldn\u2019t get his plan through Parliament. Though it\u2019s just possible the Spartans would turn out to be more committed to Brexit than they are to the cause of Ulster Unionism.\n\nOn the Stormont lock, Dublin has made clear it won\u2019t accept a deal that gives the DUP an effective veto, while the DUP is unlikely to allow Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the U.K. without one. How talks can get past that block is unclear.\n\nWhat if There Isn\u2019t a Deal? Will Johnson Seek an Extension?\n\nNo, if you believe what Johnson has been saying for months, and what he told the Conservative conference. Yes, if you believe what Johnson\u2019s government told a Scottish court on Friday morning. No, if you believe Johnson\u2019s tweet on Friday evening:\n\nJohnson and his ministers have repeatedly said they will both obey the Benn Act -- which requires them to seek an extension to talks if they don\u2019t have a deal -- and they won\u2019t seek an extension. One solution would be to get a deal, another would be to find a loophole in the law.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Can Boris Johnson get a Brexit deal? Is he even trying to? Will he delay Brexit?
