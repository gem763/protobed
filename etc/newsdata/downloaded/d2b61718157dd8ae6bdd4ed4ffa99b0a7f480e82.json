So you can buy a cuddly Pikachu but not a pair of socks as well.\n\nRemember: only six purchases per customer!\n\nWhat are the Pok\u00e9mon Center London store opening times?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreviously, shop staff have been stopping people queuing at around 2pm, so if everything is set back four hours that seems to mean queuing at all, once the store is open, is now being ruled out.\n\nThe store\u2019s Twitter account isn\u2019t explicit on that point but the best chance for getting in now is to camp overnight, or at least from the early hours of the morning.\n\nExcept, the Westfield London shopping centre, where the pop-up store is based, have said that you are not allowed to bring camping bags or tents. So if you really want to camp out you\u2019ll have to do it outside (just like Pok\u00e9mon Sword/Shield!).\n\n\u2018We receive daily deliveries and endeavour to replenish stock as quickly as possible. However, due to unprecedented demand, some products may sell out before the end of the day\u2019, says the Pok\u00e9mon Center Twitter.\n\n\u2018Our team are working hard to restock daily. However, as interest in the store has been unprecedented, some products may sell out before the shop\u2019s closure on Friday 15th November.\u2019\n\nImportant store info reminder: \ud83d\udcc5 Friday, October 18 \u2013 Friday, November 15, 2019 \u23f0 Monday to Saturday: 10am\u20146pm, Sunday: 12pm\u20146pm \ud83d\udccd @WestfieldLondon If you're yet to visit #PokemonCenterLondon check out our answers to some frequently asked questions below \u2b07\ufe0f \u2014 Pok\u00e9mon Center London Updates (@PokemonPopUp) October 21, 2019\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Center London store is open now (and we\u2019ve been)\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield Junichi Masuda interview \u2013 \u2018it really is gameplay first\u2019\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield hands-on preview \u2013 gigantic fun", "description": "You\u2019ve now got even less chance of getting a London City Pikachu, as Westfield Shopping Centre outlaws tents and camping.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pokemon-Center-London_preview-event-ea3a_1572031807.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
