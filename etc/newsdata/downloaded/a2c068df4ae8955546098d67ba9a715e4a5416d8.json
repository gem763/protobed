Even though Wojnarowski noted that the injury is not severe, the news has undoubtedly unnerved Pelicans fans who have already tabbed Williamson with reinvigorating and bringing glory to their waning franchise. Zion Williamson has been inundated with media attention since well before he arrived in the NBA. Mark Lennihan/AP\n\nBut the 19-year-old's delayed NBA debut may just be a blessing in disguise for basketball in the Big Easy.\n\nWilliamson is the most highly-anticipated NBA rookie since LeBron James first stepped on an NBA court for the Cleveland Cavaliers back in 2003. But along with those soaring expectations comes an inordinate amount of pressure and attention, even for an NBA player.\n\nRead more: The best NBA's best arenas according to fans\n\nThe Spartanburg, South Carolina, native has learned to trhive within that reality. In his first game as a Blue Devil, Williamson put up 28 points on 11-of-13 shooting to help lead then-No. 4 Duke to a monster 118-84 victory over the No. 2 Kentucky Wildcats. From then on, Williamson regularly found himself surrounded by swarms of reporters and cameramen, even while fellow future NBA lottery picks RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish sat mere feet away.\n\nHis star only burned brighter as draft day neared and the reality that he could revitalize a hapless franchise became even more of a reality. Still, Williamson has lived up to and arguably exceeded any of the weighty expectations placed on his shoulders, both on the court and off. But many of his new teammates \u2014 especially the younger ones \u2014 will need to learn how to handle the intense gaze cast upon their franchise's crown jewel.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver and Zion Williamson at the 2019 NBA Draft.

Third-year point guard Lonzo Ball was there right alongside them, plus he had the added attention garnered by his boisterous father, LaVar Ball. But James was already well seasoned in the art of navigating the bright lights by the time he joined the trio in Hollywood and, as a veteran superstar, he likely knew how to shield his younger teammates from its harsh glow.\n\nFor fellow young Pelicans Frank Jackson, Jalen Adams, Javon Bess, Jahlil Okafor, and Kenrich Williams, this level of attention is unprecedented, while fellow 2019 first-round draft picks Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker are still getting accostumed to the larger stage of the NBA.\n\nZion Williamson posts one of his famous dunks at Cameron Indoor Stadium. Grant Halverson/Getty Images\n\nAll this is to say that the relaxed atmosphere and attention that comes with Williamson's delayed debut may be a welcome respite for a very young New Orleans roster. The Pelicans will have a chance to get acquainted in their own right \u2014 and notch a few games under their belts \u2014 before welcoming the NBA's buzziest player back into their ranks. And it's almost certain that the attention Williamson will receive upon his return a few weeks into the regular season will pale in comparison to what he would have garnered during the literal opening game of the entire NBA season next week \u2014 against the league's reigning champions, no less.\n\nAnd, to be sure, New Orleans is a far superior team with its young star on the court than they are with him sidelined. Should Williamson's knee injury prove to be a lingering issue, that will certainly spell trouble for a franchise that has essentially assembled a its roster around him.\n\nBut given that Wojnarowski himself reported that the Pelicans believe \"there's no shortage of confidence on [Williamson's] full recovery,\" a brief delay in what the team hopes will be a long and fruitful career may be the best they could have hoped for.", "description": "The young Pelicans will have a chance to get acquainted without the added pressure and attention that comes with Williamson's massive following.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9fed24af90971a9081fcb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
