Taubman reportedly said, \u201cThank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so [expletive] glad we got Osuna!\u201d\n\nOsuna, as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, was charged with domestic assault in May 2018, but the charges were later withdrawn. The Astros traded for him before the end of his suspension.\n\nThe Astros initially released a statement, calling the story \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible\u201d \u2014 leading to further criticism.\n\n\u201cThe story posted by Sports Illustrated is misleading and completely irresponsible. An Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing,\u201d the Astros said. \u201cOur executive was supporting the player during a difficult time. His comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else \u2014 they were also not directed toward any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated\u2019s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d\n\nMultiple reporters, including two from the Houston Chronicle, contradicted Houston\u2019s account, saying there were no players around when Taubman went up to the group. Sports Illustrated also reported one Houston staffer apologized to the group.\n\nThe Astros then issued a statement of apology from Taubman Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThis past Saturday, during our clubhouse celebration, I used inappropriate language for which I am deeply sorry and embarrassed,\u201d Taubman said. \u201cIn retrospect, I realize that my comments were unprofessional and inappropriate. My overexuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue. Those that know me know that I am a progressive and charitable member of the community and a loving and committed husband and father. I hope that those who do not know me understand that the Sports Illustrated article does not reflect who I am or my values. I am sorry if anyone was offended by my actions.\u201d\n\nAn additional statement from team owner and chairman Jim Crane added that the Astros fully support MLB\u2019s policy on domestic violence and work to raise money to combat the issue in Texas.\n\nThe Astros were heavily criticized on Twitter:\n\nThe @astros need to stop lying and start apologizing and firing - or the commissioner needs to step on, today - or their own dishonesty and misogyny are going to overshadow their own World Series. #shameful https://t.co/fK95qYeAhU \u2014 Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cBut in truth, the Astros\u2018 front office acts as if it is tired of being yelled at about this subject.\u201d\n\n\n\nI\u2019m tired of feeling a pit in my stomach & the joy baseball usually gives me being sucked out of the room anytime our closer comes to the mound.\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t wait til Osuna is gone. https://t.co/aobU7vJJhS \u2014 Jexas (@Jexas) October 22, 2019\n\nTruly troubling actions from Brandon Taubman & Astros\u2026 and not nearly enough accountability\n\n\n\nSure seems like Astros are willing to ignore or twist the facts to suit their story, undermining others along the way, as long as it leads to wins. \u2014 Ben Nicholson-Smith (@bnicholsonsmith) October 22, 2019\n\n.If you want an example of how not to behave as a human being, Houston\u2019s Brandon Taubman provides a good one. If you want an example of how not to respond after the criticism comes, Houston\u2019s PR department\u2019s unbelievable press release is just as good. They deserve each other. https://t.co/k7ezm8lGpZ \u2014 John U. Bacon (@Johnubacon) October 22, 2019\n\nRidiculous. Lost for words. Women in baseball clubhouses have such a high tolerance for borderline intolerable things. The idea that anyone would make this up\u2026\n\n\n\nAlso, we define \u201ca difficult time\u201d differently. He gave up a homer. He hadn\u2019t been, you know, beaten up by a spouse. https://t.co/hb0oO7RnZG \u2014 Chelsea Janes (@chelsea_janes) October 22, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
