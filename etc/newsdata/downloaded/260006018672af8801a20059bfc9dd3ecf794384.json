Some scientists predict that the country could lose all its glaciers by 2200.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more.\n\nWhere a glacier once covered nearly 15 square kilometres of land in Iceland, there will soon be only a commemorative plaque beside a small patch of snow.\n\nThe glacier, once known as Okj\u00f6kull (\"j\u00f6kull\" means glacier in Icelandic) lost its status as a glacier in 2014, since it had shrunk below 2.5 square kilometres and was barely 15 metres deep, according to The Guardian. Rising temperatures due to climate change caused the glacier to melt.\n\nNow it is known simply as \"Ok.\"\n\nGlaciologists dubbed the remaining portion \"dead ice,\" since glacial flow had ceased.\n\nTo memorialise the former glacier, author Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason and geologist Oddur Sigur\u00f0sson (who first declared Ok's new status) plan to install a plaque. The sign will be unveiled August 18, in partnership with the Icelandic Hiking Society, at the site of the former glacier.\n\n\"This will be the first monument to a glacier lost to climate change anywhere in the world,\" Cymene Howe, an anthropologist at Rice University who directed a documentary about the glacier, said in a press release. \"By marking Ok's passing, we hope to draw attention to what is being lost as Earth's glaciers expire.\"\n\nHere's what the plaque, titled \"A letter to the future,\" says:\n\nThe last line - \"Only you know if we did it\" - serves as an unnerving message to people in the future who will pass by the site.\n\nBelow the text, the plaque records the current concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: a record-breaking 415 parts per million. The concentration hasn't been that high since at least 800,000 years ago, before humans evolved.\n\nHowe co-produced the documentary about the glacier, called \"Not Ok,\" last year with her colleague Dominic Boyer. The two plan to join the group installing the plaque next month.\n\nThough glaciers in Iceland have undergone brief periods of expansion, they're shrinking overall due to climate change. Iceland loses almost 65 square kilometres of glacier each year.\n\n\"Its fate will be shared by all of Iceland's glaciers unless we act now to radically curtail greenhouse gas emissions,\" Boyer said of Ok.\n\nSome scientists predict that all the country's glaciers could be completely gone by 2200. If that happens, it would raise global sea levels by an additional centimeter.\n\n\"With this memorial, we want to underscore that it is up to us, the living, to collectively respond to the rapid loss of glaciers and the ongoing impacts of climate change. For Ok glacier it is already too late,\" Howe said.", "description": "Okj\u00f6kull lost its status as a glacier in 2014 due to ice melt caused by climate change.
