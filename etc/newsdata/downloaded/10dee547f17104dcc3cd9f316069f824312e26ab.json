They vowed not to provide stabilization or development assistance in areas where the local population is mistreated.\n\nKelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the Trump administration does not endorse Turkey\u2019s military action and warned of unspecified \u201cconsequences\u201d but stopped short of condemning it.\n\n\u201cFailure to play by the rules, to protect vulnerable populations, failure to guarantee that ISIS cannot exploit these actions to reconstitute, will have consequences,\u201d she said, using a common acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nThe Russian U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, accused the United States and its coalition allies of conducting \u201cdemographic engineering\u201d that he said led to the conflict. He called for a solution that would \u201ctake into account other aspects of the Syrian crisis, not just the Turkish operation.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security Un-Security-Council-Fails-To-Condemn-Turkeys-Military-Action-In-Syria"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
