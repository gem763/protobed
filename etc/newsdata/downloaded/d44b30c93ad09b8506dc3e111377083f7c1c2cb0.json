Normally an HIA will happen during the course of the game and they\u2019ll take the player off and normally that\u2019s when it starts.\n\nTuilagi double helps England kick off with bonus-point win against Tonga Read more\n\n\u201cLast night Sam was back in our changing shed and they decided they were going to do one so he then had to go to the other side of the stadium, basically, and then do the test so it wasn\u2019t any fault of his. It was the actual test that took longer than it should\u2019ve.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything we could control so I think they\u2019ve now worked out that\u2019s not common sense is it?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to look after the athlete so they\u2019ve modified it which is great, good response. They\u2019ve shown good leadership and changed it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019ve sorted it out. I wasn\u2019t overly happy about it last night, one of your best players missing 40 minutes of the game but it is what it is. They\u2019ve acknowledge they haven\u2019t got that part of it right and they\u2019ve changed it so you can\u2019t ask for more.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nHaving virtually assured they will top their pool, the All Blacks now plan use their full squad in the next two matches against Canada, in 10 days, and Namibia four days later.\n\nAs they did four years ago, New Zealand will also train at an intensity that leaves them fatigued for these matches, before then tapering back for the quarter-final stage.\n\nHansen planned to watch Ireland\u2019s match against Scotland, one of whom will be New Zealand\u2019s quarter-final opponents, and England against Tonga.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely watch that game because we might be playing one of them and because of my friendship with Eddie I\u2019ll watch England but I won\u2019t watch too many of the others until we need to.\u201d", "description": "The All Blacks coach, Steve Hansen, has revealed World Rugby have altered the process around head injury assessments at half time", "authors": ["Liam Napier In Yokohama"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04a693e0b354b944c4c86f8196281231f30f752/0_392_4357_2614/master/4357.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0569e4945f3366809fa2a81994fbc613", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
