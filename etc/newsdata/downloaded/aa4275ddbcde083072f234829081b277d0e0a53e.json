Sounds like something straight out of a storybook.\n\nBut on the breathtaking waters of Lake Iseo in Lombardy, Italy, it's very much a reality.\n\nThe largest of four lakes in the region, what sets Lake Iseo apart is its storybook islands and their breathtaking castles.\n\nA prime example is the island of Loreto, which never fails to wow the lake's visitors thanks to its neo-gothic castle, the burst of lush green trees and plants, and remnants of the former monastery that once stood tall here.\n\nNot much is known about Loreto's history although it's believed that the monastery was built here in the 13th century, as well as a small church.\n\nAlthough frequented by fishermen and a few pilgrims, the island remained abandoned until the 1910s, when a captain named Vincenzo Richieri bought it and built the impressive neo-gothic castle to use as a private house. It also boasts a marina and two small lighthouses.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nMeanwhile the island of San Paolo is home to a monastery and heaps of large, dense green trees for postcard-worthy scenery.\n\nUnfortunately both Loreto and San Paolo are privately owned, but the good news is that you can still take boat trips which go past the islands so you can take in the picturesque scenery. (You can also do water sports such as kayaking for an unforgettable way of exploring the lake).\n\nOne island you can visit is Monte Isola, which sits in the middle of the lake and offers 17th century churches as well as a medieval castle. It's also here where you'll find some brilliant boutiques and local restaurants serving up that mouthwatering Italian cuisine.\n\n(Image: De Agostini via Getty Images)\n\nWant to visit?\n\nBooking.com can be a good source for cheap hotels near Lake Iseo , while TripAdvisor has a round-up of the best Lake Iseo hotels whether you're on a budget or looking for somewhere luxurious to stay.\n\nAs for getting there, for cheap flights from the UK, your best bet is to head to Milan Bergamo airport which is about an hour and 15 minutes away from Lake Iseo by car.\n\nRyanair offers direct flights from the UK with fares from \u20ac11.22 and you can also find fares from \u00a320 on Skyscanner although not all routes may be direct.", "description": "Lake Iseo looks like something out of a fairytale and it has breathtaking islands to explore - here's what not to miss", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "De Agostini Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584057.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Isoletta-on-Iseo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
