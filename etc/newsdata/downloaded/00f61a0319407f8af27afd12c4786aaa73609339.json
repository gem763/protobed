A devastating drought made Balkisa\u2019s harvests fail, made food prices soar, and then forced her family apart. Her husband migrated in search of work to earn money to provide for his young family, leaving her heavily pregnant and alone. \u201cSometimes if my husband had money he sent it to me so I could eat. Sometimes the money just doesn\u2019t come,\u201d she said. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t have the energy to give birth.\u201d But seven-month-old twins Hassan and Ousseni are lucky, they were born the night after Red Cross support came to Tombokiery village, Niger. The Niger Red Cross provided the family with a small cash grant. \u201cA Niger Red Cross volunteer told me to go first because she saw how exhausted I was. I used the money to buy food, then I went back home to sleep feeling relieved. Before sunrise I had given birth to my twins.\u201d Yuki Sugiura/British Red Cross 2/17 Aissa Garba, 65, gazes out of the window of her home in Tombokiery village, southern Niger Last year\u2019s drought made Aissa\u2019s crop fail, leaving the family with nothing to eat. In the Sahel rainfall has become erratic and wet seasons that people rely on are shrinking. The Sahel has one of the driest climates in the world, people who live here have always been incredibly resilient, are now having to adapt and survive to ever harsher conditions. The region is almost one degree hotter than in 1970 and could rise by several degrees by the end of the century. Record hot spells, desertification, loss of crops and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are reducing people\u2019s ability to feed themselves.

This is equivalent to all cars, trains, ships and aircraft combined.\n\nIn a tweet, the NFU highlighted British farmers\u2019 efforts to minimise the environmental impact of meat farming.\n\nThe union said: \u201c65 per cent of UK farmland is only suitable to graze cattle, reared to produce tasty food. British beef has a greenhouse gas footprint 2.5 times lower than [the] rest of the world. British farmers are proud to drive solutions to climate change & are working to achieve net-zero.\u201d\n\nA Tesco spokesperson told The Independent: \u201cOur Food Love Stories celebrate recipes both with meat and without. For those customers who tell us they are looking to eat a little less meat, our Plant Chef range offers a delicious, affordable alternative.\n\n\u201cOur aim is always to offer choice.
