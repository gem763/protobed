'He got up there, poured lighter fluid on himself and lit the match.'\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was kept in the dark about the raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\n\nIt will be seen as a sign Mulvaney has diminished influence in Donald Trump's White House\n\nBill Daley, who was White House chief of staff during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden raid, was seated next to then-President Barack Obama in a secure room at the White House during its execution.\n\nMulvaney was not pictured in a photo the White House released of President Trump in the Situation Room with Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley.\n\n'It's really unprecedented, and to me it's just a symptom of a total breakdown in the White House functions,' Chris Whipple, author of 'The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency,' told NBC News.\n\n'Only in a completely dysfunctional White House would the White House chief of staff be out of the loop on something so significant,' he noted.\n\nPresident Trump watched the special forces operation to kill al-Baghdadi via drone footage.\n\nTrump announced the success of the raid in a press conference on Sunday morning, saying that al-Baghdadi died 'whimpering and crying and screaming', and 'like a dog and a coward'.\n\nMulvaney was not pictured in the photo the White House released of President Donald Trump in the Situation Room with National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley\n\nObama's chief of staff Bill Daley (standing behind the chair in the suit, tie and jacket) was with President Obama in 2011 during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden\n\nAfter Mulvaney's panned performance in the White House press briefing room earlier this month, he came under fire again after he went on 'Fox News Sunday' to try and clarify his comments under heavy questioning from host Chris Wallace.\n\nAnd Mulvaney is reportedly fighting with fellow White House officials on the best strategy to fight off the impeachment inquiry into President Trump taking place on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn the fallout, there were reports new names were circulating through the White House for the chief of staff position and a group of conservatives wrote a letter to President Trump to support Mulvaney.\n\nHe was named 'acting' chief of staff in December 2018 after John Kelly left the position but never named permanently to the job posting.\n\nWhite House officials countered that Mulvaney's South Carolina trip was long planned and told NBC News that the acting chief of staff was 'not able to get to a secure location in time to participate' but that 'he was briefed on its success upon conclusion.'\n\nEarlier this month, Mulvaney caused a maelstrom when he told White House reporters in a televised briefing that he had held up Ukrainian aid money in order to pressure the country to look for a Democratic server.\n\nBut later, as frenzy over his apparent admission of a quid pro quo roiled Washington and news channels, Mulvaney said he had never done such a thing and attacked the media.\n\n'Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,' he said in the statement.\n\n'The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainian military aid any investigation into the 2016 election. The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption,' he said.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdad was killed by U.S. special forces on Saturday night\n\nMick Mulvaney had to walk back comments he made in a White House briefing earlier this month\n\nBut Mulvaney had defended holding up the congressionally appropriated funding in order to get the Ukrainians to investigate a Democratic email server from 2016, telling critics: 'Get over it.'\n\nIn a rare White House briefing, Mulvaney denied any knowledge of a company linked to Hunter Biden \u2013 but said the money was in fact dangled to push what he called anti- 'corruption' efforts by Ukraine.\n\nHe said of President Trump: 'Did he also mention to me in [passing] that the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it. And that's why we held up the money.'\n\nMulvaney confirmed what Trump also said in a July phone call with the president of Ukraine: that he wanted an investigation related to the hacked Democratic National Committee Server.\n\nU.S. intelligence, the Mueller probe, and bipartisan congressional committees concluded that the Russians hacked Democratic servers. But Trump wants to explore an unproven theory that the Democratic server might be in Ukraine, where information came out that implicated his now jailed 2016 campaign chair Paul Manafort.\n\nPressed on holding up money to aid to get an investigation sought by the president, in a 'quid pro quo' for a probe of the DNC server, Mulvaney said: 'We do that all the time with foreign policy.'\n\n'I have news for everybody: Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy,' Mulvaney said.", "description": "Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was kept in the dark about the raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and did not learn of it until it was already under way.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20380952-0-image-a-2_1572447702611.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
