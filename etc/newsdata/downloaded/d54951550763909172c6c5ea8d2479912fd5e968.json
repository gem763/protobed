The deposit rate was reduced further into negative territory (link), dropping by 10 basis points to negative 0.5%, while also announcing it would restart its monthly bond-buying program.\n\nThe ECB also said interest rates would remain at \"present or lower levels\" until the inflation outlook \"robustly\" converges with the bank's target inflation rate of near, but just below 2%. It also adjusted its targeted long-term refinancing operations to further spur lending and introduced a tiered system that would exempt a chunk of excess reserves parked by banks with the ECB from the negative rate. Banks though, initially rose in Europe, then gave up gains, with Banco Santander (SAN.MC) (SAN.MC) dropping 0.5%.\n\nInvestors will now be watching a news conference with ECB President Mario Draghi at 2:30 p.m. Still, some said the fresh stimulus may not be enough to boost the region's economy. \"It remains doubtful...that this will do much to reboot the euro-zone economy let alone achieve the near-2% inflation target,\" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist.\n\nThe German DAX rose 0.3% to 12408.95, the French CAC 40 rose 0.5% to 5647.26 and the U.K. FTSE 100 gained 0.3% to 7340.93.\n\nStocks in the pharmaceutical, chemicals and beverages led the gainers, while energy names such as Total SA (FP.FR) (FP.FR) and BP PLC (BP.LN) (BP.LN) lost ground.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose on the heels of the 6th-straight gain for the Dow industrials and the 5th-straight win for the S&P 500 on Wednesday. Stock futures got a boost after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted (link)that he would delay tariff hikes against China until October 15. That comes a day after China announced a list of 16 U.S. products that would be exempt from a coming round of its own tariff hikes.\n\nOf companies in the spotlight, shares of Alstom SA (ALO.FR) tumbled nearly 5% after French telecoms group Bouygues SA (EN.FR) said it has sold a 13% stake (link) in the French multinational group\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BT) (ABI.BT) shares jumped 3.5% amid reports the parent of beer giant Budweiser is planning to list a slimmer version of its Asia unit (link).\n\nIn London, shares of British American Tobacco (A) rose 1.8% after the company said it would lay off 2,300 employees by 2020. And the London Stock Exchange (LSE.LN)0.6% after the Financial Times reported (link) the group would reject a nearly $40 billion (30 billion pounds) buyout offer from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (link).\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 12, 2019 08:21 ET (12:21 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
