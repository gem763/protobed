He must also appear in court on 6 November, according to Wave 3.\n\nGoodman also apologised for his actions in a letter written to Rivest, which was shared by the news outlet.\n\nIn the letter, Goodman says he made the \u201cterrible decision with the intent only to be funny, but was clearly inappropriate and rude\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was wrong to interrupt your job, invade your personal space and leave you feeling powerless,\u201d he continued, before concluding: \u201cI sincerely apologise and deeply regret my actions where I allowed immaturity to humiliate you, myself and many others\u2026 I am so very sorry.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
