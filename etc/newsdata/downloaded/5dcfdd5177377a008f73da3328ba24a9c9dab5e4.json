During colonial rule, Salt Laws , which placed a new tax on Indian salt, had become a burden. Through the Dandi March in 1930, Gandhi challenged the Salt Laws. His picking up a small lump of natural salt from the Arabian Sea shore led to the historic civil disobedience movement.\n\nThere have been many mass movements in the world, many strands of the freedom struggle even in India, but what sets apart the Gandhian struggle and those inspired by him is the wide-scale public participation. He never held administrative or elected office. He was never tempted by power.\n\nFor him, independence was not absence of external rule. He saw a deep link between political independence and personal empowerment. He envisioned a world where every citizen has dignity and prosperity. When the world spoke about rights, Gandhi emphasized duties. He wrote in \u201cYoung India\u201d: \u201cThe true source of rights is duty. If we all discharge our duties, rights will not be far to seek.\u201d He wrote in the journal Harijan, \u201cRights accrue automatically to him who duly performs his duties.\u201d\n\nGandhi gave us the doctrine of trusteeship, which emphasized the socio-economic welfare of the poor. Inspired by that, we should think about a spirit of ownership. We, as inheritors of the earth, are responsible for its well-being, including that of the flora and fauna with whom we share our planet.\n\nIn Gandhi, we have the best teacher to guide us. From uniting those who believe in humanity to furthering sustainable development and ensuring economic self-reliance, Gandhi offers solutions to every problem.\n\nWe in India are doing our bit. India is among the fastest when it comes to eliminating poverty. Our sanitation efforts have drawn global attention. India is also taking the lead in harnessing renewable resources through efforts like the International Solar Alliance, which has brought together several nations to leverage solar energy for a sustainable future. We want to do even more, with the world and for the world.\n\nAs a tribute to Gandhi, I propose what I call the Einstein Challenge. We know Albert Einstein\u2019s famous words on Gandhi: \u201cGenerations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.\u201d", "description": "The great leader envisioned a world where every citizen has dignity and prosperity.", "authors": ["Narendra Modi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/opinion/01modi1/01modi1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
