(AP) - When the boys clad in red and white charged onto Bowles Field on Friday nights, the townsfolk packing the bleachers at Blountstown High could set aside the week\u2019s travails and cheer on the home team Tigers.\n\nBut last October, as the team racked up six wins against a single loss, Hurricane Michael hurtled across the Florida Panhandle, the region\u2019s most ferocious storm in recorded history. Nearly all of the 6,000 homes scattered across the woods of Calhoun County were damaged, and some were destroyed. At Bowles Field, 150 mph (241 kph) winds uprooted bleachers and tossed them across the soggy turf. The storm twisted goal posts and snapped the light poles that had brightened the field on Friday nights.\n\nSo when the Tigers opted to play out the rest of the season in the midst of the destruction, it once again gave the beleaguered community something to cheer about.\n\nNow, the town\u2019s refurbished football field, a key center of public life, provides a tangible symbol of recovery. New bleachers flank the sidelines, and new lights atop sturdier metal poles will shine this Friday for the team\u2019s first home game, as Blountstown rallies for its team and for itself.\n\n\u201cTo some this is just pic of a stadium and field. To us it\u2019s a sight that brings tears,\u201d Tigers football coach Beau Johnson tweeted about a photo in early August. \u201cBeautiful sight to these TIGERS!\u201d\n\nDefensive end Carson Hatchett had lamented over rumors that there would be no home games in his senior year. \u201cThat was heartbreaking,\u201d he said.\n\nHis aunt, Samantha Taylor, said the community would not have let that happen.\n\n\u201cWe are the Fighting Tigers. That is the spirit of our community,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting knocked down is not the bad thing. Staying down is the bad thing.\u201d\n\nFor a while last week, Hurricane Dorian\u2019s uncertain path threatened to delay the first home game of the season. Folks feel fortunate to have been spared another round of chaos.\n\nOn the first day of school last month, hundreds showed up at an evening pep rally. Later that week, at the team\u2019s season-opening scrimmage an hour\u2019s drive away in Tallahassee, fans for the visiting Tigers outnumbered those of the home team.\n\nAnd two weeks ago, in the first game of the season against the Arnold High Marlins 60 miles (97 kilometers) away in Panama City Beach, the Tigers delivered a 43-10 win.\n\nFor Ladona Kelley, whose son Zeb is a Tigers linebacker, it was a boost for town morale. But as the family liaison for Calhoun County Schools, she knows of the struggles that still linger.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s been many months since Hurricane Michael hit our area, every day it\u2019s still impacting us,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nAcross town, blue tarps cover rooftops that have yet to be repaired. It could take years to restore the power lines and other infrastructure - not to mention damaged lives and livelihoods.\n\nFallen longleaf pines, snapped like twigs by the Hurricane\u2019s fierce winds, remain untouched across huge swaths of Calhoun County\u2019s 574 square miles. The pine forests, which sustained the community with logging jobs, could take decades, if not generations, to recover.\n\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture called the damage to Calhoun County\u2019s timber industry \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\n\nIn all, Hurricane Michael caused more than $25 billion in damage as it swirled across the northern Florida coast, into Georgia and the Carolinas. Florida officials blamed the storm for at least 43 deaths. A Calhoun County teacher, the mother of a Blountstown High football player, was among those who perished.\n\nAs Hurricane Michael approached Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast last October, forecasts focused on picturesque beaches, tourist attractions and the pricey real estate - not on places like Calhoun County, an inland expanse of rural enclaves, the biggest of them 2,500-population Blountstown.\n\n\u201cPeople have forgotten about us because we\u2019re in a rural area and the hurricane didn\u2019t hit a big city,\u201d said Johnson, the football coach. \u201cMaybe the outside world just didn\u2019t really know how bad it got.\u201d\n\nChris Cutchins, an offensive tackle for the Tigers, knows how bad it got - and how bad it still is.\n\nHe was in his family\u2019s single-wide trailer when the rumbling began. The family bolted for safety to a relative\u2019s sturdier brick house. Even then, the storm shook fear into him.\n\n\u201cYou could hear the wind. It was shaking the door. Bricks were moving in a concrete house,\u201d Cutchins recalled.\n\nWhen he and his family returned to their own home, they found a mangled mess. Their trailer\u2019s roof tore open, and the walls had caved in. Their camper toppled to its side.\n\nHe and his family righted the camper and spent the next 10 months in it, with no air conditioning or relief from the area\u2019s sweltering humidity.\n\nFootball should be the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind, especially when there\u2019s still so much work to do - but it can be a rallying force. For instance, in Paradise, California, where a November fire destroyed nearly 19,000 structures and killed 86 people, a football game last month brought out thousands of people .\n\n\u201cIt helps provide some normalcy. It gives people something to focus on instead of their problems,\u201d said Blountsville city manager Traci Smith Hall, who was born and raised in the community.\n\nThat might explain why her son Brody, a center for the Tigers, knew how to respond when coach Johnson called the team together soon after last year\u2019s storm. Johnson offered a choice: Play out the rest of the season or regroup when their hearts and minds weren\u2019t so distracted.\n\nThe boys insisted they could play on - not for themselves, they said, but for their community.\n\n\u201cThat was something good that could bring some hope to the community and a little bit of positivity,\u201d Brody said.\n\nLinebacker Zeb Kelley echoed the sentiment: \u201cWe just knew we needed to play for the community.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Bobby Caina Calvan at http://twitter.com/bobbycalvan\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When the boys clad in red and white charged onto Bowles Field on Friday nights, the townsfolk packing the bleachers at Blountstown High could set aside the week's travails and cheer on the home team Tigers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bobcaina Calvan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/hurricane_recovery_football_25001_c0-139-3330-2080_s1770x1032.jpg?343211cc0a540842a60b2df7db8571f308d5e9df", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
