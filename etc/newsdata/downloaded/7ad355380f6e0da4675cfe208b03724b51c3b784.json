I think emerging markets look better than the developed world.\"\n\nIn evaluating where to invest based on that outlook, he said that investors were dramatically overweight on US stocks, as the US makes up about 25% of the global economy. But according to Morningstar, it's 54% of the global stock-market capitalization.\n\n\"A reasonable investor in the United States should feel comfortable having at least 45% of their equity money outside the US, and having half their equity money outside the US is fine,\" he said. \"Once we turn the tide on trade conflict and a move more towards a trade peace, I think the rest of the world will begin to do better.\"\n\nRead more: The cofounder of $300 billion private-equity behemoth Apollo outlines 4 mistakes the average investor makes \u2014 and explains how he takes advantage\n\nKelly suggests investing about two-thirds of that money in developed markets, emphasizing that a lasting trade truce between the US and China would help international stocks a great deal. He also thinks European countries will finally adopt fiscal stimulus measures to strengthen their economies.\n\n\"Europe has got more cyclical room to grow\" than the US, he said, adding that several other factors contribute to his optimism. \"Europe is running a trade surplus, and the US is running a trade deficit, which should bring the euro up and the dollar down, which would tend to amplify the current trend in European investment.\"\n\nSimple ways for investors to get exposure to those areas include the iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets ETF and iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF.\n\nAlong with their low valuations, Kelly said a couple of major trends were going to help emerging-market stocks over the next five years, including the growing Asian middle class.\n\n\"They've just got better population dynamics, better productivity dynamics, they'll grow faster,\" he said. And even though he expects the trade war to end, he said it has started some lasting trends that would help Asian countries at China's expense.\n\n\"There's going to be continued pressure on China and continued pressure to move manufacturing out of China and into other regional players,\" he said. He named Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia as the biggest beneficiaries of that shift and said South Korea and Taiwan would be helped as well.\n\nHe also said valuations of Indian stocks were higher compared with those countries, but there are still opportunities to be found there.", "description": "David Kelly of JPMorgan Asset Management tells investors how to adjust as markets outside the US improve and the domestic economy fades.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e1d462e22af7819529ecd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
