Thousands of tourists are also stuck in the US and dozens of other countries. Most of the tourists are from the UK with an estimated 150,000 people, followed by Germany with about 140,000 holidaymakers.\n\nMany of Thomas Cook\u2019s German subsidiaries have stopped trading, but at present the group\u2019s German airline, Condor, is still operating. About 240,000 people are booked to return home on Condor flights, but the airline will not carry those who booked their trips via Thomas Cook. The situation in Germany could get worse if Condor fails in its attempt to secure a \u20ac200m (\u00a3176m) bridging loan from the German government.\n\nThe Guardian view on Thomas Cook: wiped out by debt | Editorial Read more\n\nMelisa Rodr\u00edguez, a Spanish politician and representative for Tenerife, said the collapse of Thomas Cook could hit the Spanish economy and the Canary Islands in particular. She demanded action from Spain\u2019s caretaker government.\n\nAbout 525 Thomas Cook flights, carrying mainly tourists, were due to fly into Spanish airports over the next 15 days, with about 70% on UK-Spanish routes. Rodr\u00edguez said 30,000 people were currently stranded on the Canary Islands, 3,000 on the Balearics.\n\nShe said the collapse could lead to the loss of thousands of Spanish jobs as vast swaths of the economy on Spanish islands were directly dependent on Thomas Cook package deals. Rodr\u00edguez said 4 million people travelled to the Canary Islands with Thomas Cook every year and hundreds of hotel operators could go under if they were not paid or paid late as a result of Thomas Cook\u2019s insolvency.\n\nGreek ministers called a cabinet meeting in Athens on Monday to discuss the financial impact of Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. \u201cThe priority right now is the repatriation of the company\u2019s customers,\u201d Grigoris Tasios, who heads the Hellenic Hoteliers Federation, told the Guardian. \u201cBut we\u2019re talking about an economic disaster with first estimates pointing to losses of at least \u20ac300m.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook was the biggest UK holiday operator in Greece, sending 3 million visitors a year to the islands and employing 1,000 people on the ground. Almost 50 Greek hotels have franchise agreements with Thomas Cook.\n\nOn Crete, where 20,000 passengers are believed to have been marooned, tourism officials likened the company\u2019s collapse to a massive earthquake that would reverberate through the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s a seven-richter earthquake and we are expecting a tsunami,\u201d said Michalis Vlatakis, president of Crete\u2019s travel bureaux and travel agents. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the contracts of the visitors who have come and are now lost, it\u2019s all those contracts that won\u2019t materialise because people who were expected to come up until 10 November simply won\u2019t travel.\u201d\n\nTurkish officials said thousands of hotel jobs could be at risk unless another operator stepped in to partner with Turkish hotel chains.\n\n\u201cSome hotels worked solely for Thomas Cook,\u201d said Osman Ayik, the president of the Turkish Hoteliers Federation. \u201cMany hotels will suffer difficulties.\u201d He said some Turkish hotel owners still had not received cash owed from tour operators that went bust long ago. \u201cIf something similar happens with Thomas Cook then hoteliers could go bankrupt.\u201d\n\nIn Tunisia, the country\u2019s tourism minister, Ren\u00e9 Trabelsi, said hotels were owed about \u20ac60m from Thomas Cook for stays in July and August. \u201cI will have a meeting on Tuesday with the British embassy in Tunisia and the hotel owners to see how debt could be redeemed,\u201d he said.", "description": "Governments are in crisis-planning mode over efforts to repatriate 500,000 tourists", "authors": ["Rupert Neate", "Helena Smith", "Nils Pratley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997450fe6bab69c3bc1ce31f2d031fa373fd5c04/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb33b048f5309d22267513be9a3f4ceb", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
