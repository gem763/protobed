Represented Italy powerfully at the G-7. Loves his Country greatly & works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe Conte-led government, comprising the 5Stars and the far-right League of Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, collapsed earlier this month. Salvini pulled the plug on the coalition, hoping for a snap election that could make him prime minister, given the League's lead in the polls.\n\nSalvini's dream scenario could still materialize but looks increasingly unlikely. An initial PD veto on Conte's reappointment has officially fallen, which could pave the way for a new 5Stars-PD government that excludes the League from power.\n\nThe two parties are currently engaged in negotiations ahead of their respective meetings with President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTrump's endorsement of Conte \u2014 whom he initially called \"Giuseppi\" before deleting and rewriting his tweet \u2014 isn't entirely surprising. The two leaders have heaped praise on each other in the past.", "description": "US president tweets his support to Giuseppe Conte.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Quint Forgey", "Charlie Cooper", "Hans Von Der Burchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1157173485-1200x628.jpg"}
