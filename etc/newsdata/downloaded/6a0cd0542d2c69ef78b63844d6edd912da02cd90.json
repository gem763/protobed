Global warming is a hoax, cutting taxes for the wealthy helps regular folks, President Trump is extremely concerned with corruption \u2014 if you get enough people to repeat your ludicrous claim, it will be treated as serious and worthy of consideration.\n\nWhen you get into court, however, it becomes quite a bit harder to serve up laughable claims. This is what Trump and his advocates are discovering as they desperately try to shield his tax returns from public view.\n\nThey just suffered another defeat in that long battle: A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has ruled against Trump in his lawsuit to keep Congress from seeing his tax returns.\n\nWhen Trump first decided to refuse to release his returns, he promised to release them as soon as he was done being audited by the IRS, which turned out to be a lie. When he became president, his spokespeople said that the election is over and he won, so stuff it.\n\nBut things changed when Democrats won the House. Now they have both subpoena power and the right to demand that the IRS turn over any American\u2019s tax returns. Trump\u2019s cronies and hacks resisted the latter demand, but Democrats on the House Oversight Committee did something clever: Instead of subpoenaing Trump, they subpoenaed Mazars, his accounting firm, a company that is presumably reluctant to simply ignore the law.\n\nTrump sued to block Mazars from releasing Trump\u2019s financials. Despite a long history of courts ruling that Congress has broad oversight powers, Trump asserted that the committee\u2019s subpoenas to his accounting firm are unlawful because they\u2019re politically motivated and Congress doesn\u2019t have a good enough reason for asking.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the fact that the committee cited its oversight of ethics rules and the possibility that new legislation might be needed to update them. That\u2019s a pretty clear and persuasive argument, since the Trump presidency demonstrates that our current ethics rules are inadequate when confronted with a president as spectacularly corrupt as Trump.\n\nThe Oversight Committee also specifically noted the testimony of former Trump lawyer and current federal inmate Michael Cohen, who alleged that Trump lied about his income and assets to banks in order to obtain loans, which if proven would constitute bank fraud.\n\nSo a 2-1 majority of the appeals court panel affirmed the lower court decision that Trump lost and ruled that the subpoena is indeed within Congress\u2019s powers to issue. So pending the inevitable appeal, Mazars will have to turn over eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nBut Trump might still be taking solace from a dissent, written by Judge Neomi Rao, a newcomer on the appeals court who was recently appointed by Trump. She took the rather extraordinary position that \u201callegations of illegal conduct against the President cannot be investigated by Congress except through impeachment,\u201d and since the Oversight Committee is not impeaching Trump, they can\u2019t demand his tax records from his accounting firm, no matter what their legislative purpose.\n\nDespite the loss, it\u2019s possible that Trump views Rao\u2019s dissent as a hint of how the courts might side with him later. If he appealed to the full circuit court \u2014 which has a majority of judges appointed by Republican presidents \u2014 might they accept that argument, no matter how inane and utterly unsupported by precedent it is? And since this case will almost certainly wind up before the Supreme Court in a matter of months, will five justices bail Trump out?\n\nTrump\u2019s problem is he\u2019s facing a crush of cases involving his tax returns, all at the same time. He just lost at the district court level in another case involving an investigation by the New York district attorney. The judge in that case called Trump\u2019s assertion that the president can\u2019t even be investigated for wrongdoing \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s fundamental structure and constitutional values.\u201d\n\nThere are three separate cases hurtling up the ladder: the Oversight Committee case, the New York D.A. case and the case filed by the Ways and Means Committee. If Trump loses any of the three, his tax returns will likely become public in short order. Everyone, Republicans and Democrats alike, agrees that what the returns reveal will be scandalous. Tax avoidance? Definitely. Tax evasion? Probably. Partnerships with shady characters, even criminals? No one will be surprised.\n\nAnd if it happens, it will be in the heart of the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump did get one piece of good news today: Deutsche Bank, long the only bank reckless enough to lend him money, told a court in another case that it is not actually in possession of Trump\u2019s tax returns, so Congress can\u2019t get the returns from them.\n\nBut with the other three cases in the pipeline, there\u2019s only one group of people that can save Trump: John G. Roberts Jr., Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil M. Gorsuch, and Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nThese cases will end up before the Supreme Court, and all five conservative justices will have to agree that no matter what the Constitution and the law say, what matters is protecting Trump. I wish I could say there\u2019s no way they will.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: The government is working overtime to keep Trump\u2019s tax returns secret\n\nHarry Litman: Can the Justice Department actually block the Manhattan DA\u2019s subpoena of Trump\u2019s taxes?\n\nHarry Litman: A federal judge takes a sledgehammer to Trump\u2019s stonewalling\n\nCatherine Rampell: There\u2019s another whistleblower complaint.
