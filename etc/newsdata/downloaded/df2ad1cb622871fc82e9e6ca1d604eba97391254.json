REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\nThe emails confirm Mark Forkner told the FAA in January 2017 that the company would delete references to a key safety system known as MCAS from the operator\u2019s manual \u201cbecause it is outside the normal operating envelope.\u201d\n\nA November 2016 email from Forkner to someone in the FAA said he was working to \u201cjedi-mind tricking regulators into accepting the training that I got accepted by FAA.\u201d\n\nEarlier Friday, the FAA disclosed to Congress instant messages from Forkner about the 737 MAX suggested more concerns about MCAS than was previously known and that Boeing may have misled the FAA.\n\nRepresentative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, wrote U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao late Friday asking her to \u201cfully cooperate with the committee\u2019s outstanding request for records and provide unredacted emails immediately.\u201d\n\nDeFazio said in the letter it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d that emails from Forkner to an FAA employee equated the certification process for the 737 MAX with \u201cjedi-mind\u201d tricks and boasting that the Boeing employee \u201cusually get[s] what I want.\u201d\n\nDeFazio said the email suggested \u201cimproper coziness between the regulator and the regulated.\u201d\n\nHe wants the department to provide \u201cunredacted emails so that we can assess these emails in their full context.\u201d\n\nIn April, the committee sought emails related to the 737 MAX and in May FAA officials acknowledged they had identified an estimated 2,600 responsive emails from the FAA\u2019s Aircraft Evaluation Group in Seattle alone.\n\n\u201cThey also indicated that they had identified a fuller body of more than 500,000 emails responsive to the committee\u2019s request. Until this morning, the FAA had only delivered a few hundred emails to the committee, although it had delivered tens of thousands of responsive documents,\u201d DeFazio said.\n\nA lawyer for Forkner, David Gerger, said in an e-mail to Reuters on Friday that \u201cbased on everything he knew, he absolutely thought this plane was safe.\u201d\n\nBoeing said in an a statement that it was cooperating and providing documents to Congress.", "description": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday turned over 10 pages of emails to Congress from a former chief technical pilot on the Boeing 737 MAX that disclosed new details of the company's efforts to win approval from regulators around the world and drew the ire of a top Democratic lawmaker.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442486160&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H21R", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
