The maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels has announced the release of Creatable World, its first series of gender-neutral dolls.\n\nThe dolls differ from Mattel\u2019s gendered Barbie and GI Joe dolls in subtle but significant ways. The dolls are a blank slate. No broad shoulders, no full hips, no long lashes. Children of any gender identification are encouraged to play with them.\n\n\u201cToys are a reflection of culture and as the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity, we felt it was time to create a doll line free of labels,\u201d Mattel said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThrough research, we heard that kids don\u2019t want their toys dictated by gender norms. This line allows all kids to express themselves freely.\u201d\n\nToy stories: can a woke makeover win Barbie and Monopoly new fans? Read more\n\nIt added: \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful Creatable World will encourage people to think more broadly about how all kids can benefit from doll play.\u201d\n\nToy companies are vigorously retooling their products to align with advancements in representation, inclusion and diversity that Gen-Z children \u2013 not their millennial parents \u2013 are largely responsible for.\n\nStudies examining gender identification among young children are hard to come by, but a recent report by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles found that 27% of California teens surveyed identified as gender-nonconforming to varying extents.\n\nJust this month, numerous conversation-starting toys and board games have come out. Hasbro released a gender-swapped version of Monopoly entitled Ms Monopoly, where women players earn more than men. Meanwhile, Mattel released a slew of culturally diverse Barbies (including a \u201cD\u00eda de los Muertos Barbie\u201d that garnered accusations of cultural appropriation).\n\nThe response hasn\u2019t been unanimously positive. Hasbro and Mattel have been accused of attempting to profit off culture wars. \u201cThere\u2019s already this vibe in the [board] gaming community that anything Monopoly does is a cash-grab,\u201d John \u201cHex\u201d Carter, a board game designer and consultant, said in an interview with the Guardian last week. \u201cBecause the market is already flooded with so many different versions of it. So the motivation behind a game like Ms Monopoly is transparent: to make money.\u201d\n\nMattel\u2019s gender-neutral doll has won over some in the LGBTQ community. \u201cSo many children and parents never saw themselves represented in toys and dolls, but this new line raises the bar for inclusion thanks to input from parents, physicians and children themselves,\u201d the LGBT advocacy group Glaad wrote on Twitter.\n\nDespite the progressiveness of its Creatable World dolls, Mattel is quick to assert itself as apolitical.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of politics,\u201d Mattel\u2019s president told Time Magazine, \u201cand we respect the decision any parent makes around how they raise their kids. Our job is to stimulate imaginations. Our toys are ultimately canvases for cultural conversation, but it\u2019s your conversation, not ours; your opinion, not ours.\u201d", "description": "Mattel release comes as toy companies retool products to align with fast-advancements in representation, inclusion and diversity", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Wheeler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba16fb194020241bde4b214e1838cf744626392a/0_12_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64ce88fc72fd5cef8391eedde3ed198e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
