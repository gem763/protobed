REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nThe congressional inquiry found instances where Deutsche Bank staff in the United States and elsewhere flagged concerns about new Russian clients and transactions involving existing ones, but were ignored by managers, two of the people said.\n\nLawmakers are also examining whether Deutsche Bank facilitated the funneling of illegal funds into the United States as a correspondent bank, where it processes transactions for others, one of the sources said.\n\nThe congressional probe, whose initial findings have not been previously reported, is at an early stage, and it is not yet clear whether it will lead to any action against the bank, the three sources said.\n\nA Deutsche Bank spokesman, Troy Gravitt, said the bank cannot comment on the work of the congressional committees but remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.\n\nAddressing past deficiencies in the bank\u2019s controls, the spokesman said: \u201cWe have worked to address them, taken disciplinary measures with regards to certain individuals and reviewed our client onboarding and monitoring processes.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives Financial Services Committee declined to comment.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House began examining possible money laundering in U.S. property deals involving President Donald Trump, a Republican, earlier this year. The lawmakers are also looking into whether Trump\u2019s dealings left him subject to the influence of foreign individuals or governments.\n\nThe White House and a Trump Organization spokeswoman, Amanda Miller, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDeutsche Bank has been drawn into the inquiry as Trump\u2019s biggest lender and submitted documents to investigators in response to a subpoena.\n\nThe stakes are high for the German lender, which is trying to engineer a turnaround under Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing after a multi-year bet on building a global investment banking business unravelled.\n\nGraham Barrow, a financial crime consultant, said that while the bank had since sought to reform, it had taken too many risks in countries such as Russia.\n\n\u201cThe bank decided to go for becoming a global investment bank,\u201d Barrow said. \u201cThey were compromised.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment on Barrow\u2019s view.\n\nIn 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay regulators in the United States and Britain $630 million (511.24 million pounds) in fines for organising $10 billion in sham trades that could have been used to launder money out of Russia. Two of the sources said that the preliminary findings of the congressional investigators may have some overlap with that case but also include lapses unrelated to that matter.\n\nNew evidence thrown up by the congressional probe could feed into further investigations by other authorities, regulatory experts said.\n\nIf evidence of wrongdoing is found, it could also harm the bank\u2019s efforts to strengthen its relationships with U.S. regulators and deter investors concerned about the possibility of future regulatory sanctions. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares hit an all-time low last month.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA\n\nEarlier this year, the House Financial Services Committee served a 12-page subpoena on Deutsche Bank. Reuters has seen a version with portions blacked out.\n\nLawmakers requested documents that identify \u201cany financial relationship, transactions, or ties\u201d between Trump, his family members and his companies and \u201cany foreign individual, entity, or government\u201d, according to the subpoena.\n\nIt also asks for hundreds of documents relating to other bank clients, including Russian oligarchs, the three sources said. These documents include account applications, know-your-client money laundering checks, internal assessments of \u201csuspicious activity\u201d, as well as information about loans and mortgages, according to the subpoena.\n\nAlthough Trump has challenged the release of his banking records in court, in April Deutsche started handing over information that is not directly related to the president and is continuing to do so, one of the people said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Deutsche Bank headquarters are seen in Frankfurt, Germany October 8, 2015.
