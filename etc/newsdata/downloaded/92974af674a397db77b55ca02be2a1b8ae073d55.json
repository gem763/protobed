He claims USC wasn\u2019t a victim of any scheme, but rather based admission decisions in part on expectations of donations from well-heeled families.\n\nThere is a long-held assumption that money influences college admissions, but the 18 previously undisclosed documents, obtained during the discovery process in the case, appear to make the direct connection in stark terms.\n\nThey include intricate spreadsheets color-coded by university officials to track \u201cspecial-interest applicants\u201d\u2014applicants flagged for their connections to USC officials, trustees, donors or other VIPs\u2014with direct references to past and prospective dollar amounts of gifts from their families.\n\nAlso included are email exchanges about specific candidates whose qualifications were portrayed as questionable by admissions and other officials but whose family ties and bank funds won out.\n\n\u201cVIP\u201d students were described in spreadsheets with references like \u201cgiven 2 million already,\u201d \u201c1 mil pledge,\u201d \u201cPreviously donated $25k to Heritage Hall\u201d and \u201cfather is surgeon,\u201d the filings show.\n\nWilliam \"Rick\" Singer, founder of the Edge College & Career Network, pleaded guilty to charges in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal.

In the email, Mr. Singer set up a 2007 meeting between the then-university president, who is now deceased, and an individual who isn\u2019t identified. A person familiar with the matter said the individual was a wealthy parent and client of Mr. Singer\u2019s who hasn\u2019t been charged in the case.\n\nThe filing was made by lawyer Martin G. Weinberg as part of a dispute over whether USC should have to produce records showing whether it favored wealthy and well-connected families. Mr. Weinberg, who represents two parents who have pleaded not guilty in the admissions-cheating scheme, has argued that parents donated to USC as part of a standard admissions practice that was actively encouraged by USC.\n\nUSC said in a statement Tuesday that the school allows many departments to mark applicants with a \u201cspecial-interest tag,\u201d and that the emails disclosed in the court filing \u201cdemonstrate that no Athletic Department official has the authority to compel admissions decisions.\u201d\n\nThe university called the court filing an effort to divert attention from the underlying fraud charges.\n\nUSC said in a separate recent court filing that its admissions office doesn\u2019t track donations, know dollar amounts given or \u201cfocus on donations in deciding whether to admit an applicant.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Singer didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nProsecutors have positioned their case on the theory that colleges are victims of the sprawling fraud and argue that the parents\u2019 payments, some of which ended up in school coffers, weren\u2019t donations, but rather quid pro quos arranged by parents, Mr. Singer and corrupt athletics staff members.\n\nMr. Singer has admitted to running a $25 million scheme in which parents allegedly gave money to his bogus charity, with the agreement Mr. Singer would then pay coaches or their athletic programs to designate his clients\u2019 children as athletic recruits, regardless of athletic ability. In some instances, parents went so far as to help Mr. Singer fabricate athletic profiles for their teens, according to charging documents and court testimony.\n\nDefense lawyers have been portraying Mr. Singer\u2019s actions as essentially sanctioned by USC, where athletic officials were under pressure to raise money and courted walk-on players whose parents could make big donations.\n\nAt times, USC staffers joked about the shortcomings of applicants. In one email exchange included in Tuesday\u2019s filing, admissions officials mocked one applicant\u2019s grammar but agreed he was \u201cgood enough to shag balls for the tennis team,\u201d ending with a crass \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head\u201d reference.\n\nMr. Weinberg made the filing as part of his defense of one of his clients, parent Robert Zangrillo, a Miami developer who has pleaded not guilty and is accused of paying Mr. Singer to bribe a USC official to admit his daughter as a rower.\n\nThe athletic department gave the girl a \u201cspecial interest tag,\u201d USC said in a recent court filing.\n\nIn a February 2014 email exchange, Donna Heinel, a former associate senior USC athletic director; Ron Orr, a senior associate athletic director for development; and others discussed a walk-on water polo player with whose family the school had been building a relationship for a year. They describe the family as \u201ca high-level prospect with 1-5M potential,\u201d though there appears to be some jockeying over how much of any gift would go to USC\u2019s business school versus its athletics department.\n\nMs. Heinel told Mr. Orr, \u201cIf this is not working out the way you planned, I can have Admissions pull the approval.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally sucks,\u201d he responded later that night, adding, \u201cdon\u2019t pull we will guilt them.\u201d\n\nMs. Heinel has pleaded not guilty to a charge of racketeering conspiracy related to Mr. Singer\u2019s scheme.\n\nMs. Heinel\u2019s attorney Nina Marino said the documents show \u201cUSC admission was directly linked to donations\u201d and said Ms. Heinel at all times was doing the job that was expected of her by the university.\n\nMr. Orr, who hasn\u2019t been charged, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn an exchange from 2018, Ms. Heinel asked USC admissions dean Timothy Brunold to move to spring-semester admission a candidate whose family \u201chas helped build the foundation of many USC projects and initiatives\u201d even though her test scores are \u201cwell below the standard.\u201d He agreed to do so, the exchange indicates.\n\nMr. Brunold didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. He said in a court declaration that most students with a \u201cspecial interest tag\u201d aren\u2019t admitted and that the school doesn\u2019t keep track of the exact percent.\n\n\u201cIf I had known that a prospective student\u2019s family had donated $50,000 or $100,000 to USC, it would not have affected the Admission Department\u2019s decision whether to admit the student,\u201d Mr. Brunold said in the filing.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com and Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "description": "Emails among athletics, admissions and fundraising officials at the University of Southern California show the school explicitly weighed how much money applicants\u2019 families could donate when determining whether to admit students.", "authors": ["Jennifer Levitz", "Melissa Korn", "Jennifer.Levitz Wsj.Com", "Melissa.Korn Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103556/social"}
