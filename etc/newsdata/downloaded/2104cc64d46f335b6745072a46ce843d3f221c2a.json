Buzz60\n\nThe end of 2019 is drawing close, so now is a good time to review your retirement accounts and take steps to put your financial house in order.\n\nExperts recommend putting two action items on your to-do list.\n\nTake your required minimum distribution: You generally have to start taking required minimum distributions or RMDs from your individual retirement account (IRA), SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA or retirement plan account when you reach 70\u00bd.\n\nHow much you take depends on the value of your IRA and your life expectancy. According to the IRS, the RMD for each year is calculated by dividing the IRA account balance as of Dec. 31 of the prior year by the applicable distribution period or life expectancy. You can determine your distribution period or life expectancy by using the Tables in Appendix B of Publication 590B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\n\nRMD rules can be tricky, so it\u2019s best to consult with a financial professional who can help you avoid mistakes, many of which can be costly.\n\nSocial Security's tiny raise: You'll get only a small increase in Social Security benefits in 2020. What should you do?\n\nWorking past 70: How does it affect my Social Security benefits?\n\nKeep your nest egg snug.

Likewise, beneficiaries who inherited a traditional IRA \u2013 even if they are not yet 70\u00bd \u2013 have to take RMDs. An IRA owner must calculate the RMD separately for each IRA that he or she owns but can withdraw the total amount from one or more of the IRAs. RMDs required from 401(k) and 457(b) plans have to be taken separately from each of those plan accounts. If you\u2019re still working after age 70\u00bd, you may not have to take an RMD from your employer-sponsored 401(k) plan.\n\n\u201cMissing an RMD results in a 50% penalty, which is one of the biggest penalties out there when it comes to retirement accounts,\u201d says Sarah Brenner, an IRA analyst with Ed Slott and Co. \u201cWhile it is possible to get this penalty waived by later taking the RMD and filing Form 5329, the safest approach is to get the RMD out by the deadline.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t need your RMD? If you are charitably inclined and must take an RMD, you can satisfy your RMD with a qualified charitable distribution or QCD, Brenner says. \u201cThis is a direct transfer from your IRA to a charity, which is not included in income for the year,\u201d she says.\n\nThe limit for QCDs is $100,000 annually.\n\nReview your assets: At least once per year, review your investment policy statement (IPS). That\u2019s a document that outlines what percent of your money should be in stocks, bonds and cash, and when you will rebalance those asset classes.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an IPS, you should create one \u2013 before year-end. \u201cAll investors should have an IPS,\u201d says Robert Johnson, a finance professor at Creighton University. \u201cAnd it is best to develop an IPS in a rather calm market.\"\n\nIf you don't have a plan, create one, regardless of market conditions.\n\nIf you have an IPS, check whether your asset allocation matches your stated or target mix. If it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to start reducing the percent invested in what, in essence, are your winners and increasing the percent invested in your losers.\n\nYour asset allocation is supposed to reflect your time horizon, your investment objectives and your risk tolerance. Over the course of a year, it\u2019s likely your asset allocation no longer reflects your target mix.\n\nIf you own lots of accounts earmarked for retirement \u2013 401(k)s, IRAs, Roth IRAs and taxable accounts \u2013 reviewing your asset allocation can be an onerous and time-consuming task. That\u2019s why reviewing it now and making the appropriate changes before year-end is prudent, especially if buying and selling assets creates taxable income.\n\nBe sure to consult with your investment adviser and tax professional before you start rebalancing your retirement accounts.\n\nNo matter what, don\u2019t succumb to recency bias.\n\n\u201cWhile recent market activity has been quite volatile, when reviewing an IPS, investors should not concern themselves with recent market moves or the crisis de jour,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThe whole point on an IPS is to guide you through changing market conditions. It should not be changed as a result of market fluctuations.\u201d\n\nRobert Powell is the editor of TheStreet\u2019s Retirement Daily and contributes regularly to USA TODAY.
