REUTERS/Stefan Baldauf\n\nThe news also helped the stock cross $300 for the first time since March 1 and surpass General Motors Co as the most valuable car company in the United States.\n\nThe following six graphs offer an illustration of Tesla\u2019s progress in key areas.\n\nDELIVERIES\n\nThe company said it was \u201chighly confident\u201d in exceeding the low end of its 2019 forecast range.\n\n\u201cNot only were the numbers good, the group confirmed it is ahead of schedule for the Model Y as well as the new plant in Shanghai. The group has had its fair share of setbacks over the years, but now it seems to be moving up a gear,\u201d CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.\n\nTesla Deliveries here\n\nOPERATING EXPENSES\n\nThe carmaker, which is trying to keep a lid on costs, said it had cut expenses 16% on a year-on-year basis, citing improvements in operating efficiency and a reduction in manufacturing and material costs.\n\n\u201cStronger than anticipated 3Q results highlight progress in operational efficiencies; however, we see several items during the quarter as unsustainable on a near to mid-term basis,\u201d Cowen analysts said, pointing to operating and capital expenses.\n\nTesla Operating Expenses here\n\nGROSS MARGINS\n\nTesla\u2019s gross margins, an important profit indicator for investors, surpassed expectations in the third quarter.\n\nJP Morgan analysts said they were not certain about the quality of the gross margin beat in the third quarter, though.\n\nTesla Margins here\n\nFREE CASH FLOW AND DEBT:\n\nThe electric carmaker expects generally to be cash flow positive and said it was now self-funding. Some on Wall Street were skeptical.\n\n\u201cWe believe Tesla has been deferring Shanghai capex payments into 2020, so cash flow could get hit further,\u201d RBC analyst Joseph Spak said.\n\nTesla cash flow here\n\nSHARE REACTION TO QUARTERLY REPORTS:\n\nA year ago, Tesla gave a quarterly report that similarly smashed investors\u2019 expectations, igniting a rally that sent its shares 31% higher over the next two months, only to see the stock decline through much of 2019 over worries about corporate governance, profitability and demand for the Model 3.\n\n\u201cAs Musk talks the talk and usually has not consistently delivered, last night Elon & the team walked the walk in strong fashion as Q3 looks to be an inflection point quarter for the Tesla story that will cause a historic short covering this morning in shares which have languished this year,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nHow Tesla shares reacted to quarterly reports here\n\nCASH POSITION\n\nInvestors have been worried about the automaker\u2019s cash burn. Tesla\u2019s balance sheet now appears extremely healthy, Baird analyst Ben Kallo said.\n\n\u201cBears may argue Tesla is underinvesting, though we believe current and historical CapEx and R&D investments should continue to support an attractive top-line growth profile\u201d.\n\nA look at Tesla's cash positihere", "description": "Tesla Inc's shares sky-rocketed on Thursday after the electric car maker surprised investors with a rare quarterly profit, and delivered a record number of cars while keeping a lid on costs.", "authors": ["Akanksha Rana", "Noor Zainab Hussain", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444643669&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1WQ-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
