David Wright is at the white house with the story. Good morning to you, David. Reporter: Good morning, Eva. This morning the white house is regrouping after a difficult week on multiple fronts. There was blistering criticism this week over the president's Syria policy, controversy over the decision to host next year's g7 summit at the president's own golf resort and finally damage control after the acting chief of staff seemed to confess that there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine. That's the new t-shirt being sold by the trump campaign featuring the president's pompadour right there over the \"O.\" It's a phrase that stood out in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's press briefing this week in which Mulvaney for the first time acknowledged the administration withheld military aid to Ukraine in part to pressure them to investigate corruption.

House speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN she considered it to be a confession and said she saw it as an example of the trump white house trying to make lawlessness normal and even make lawlessness a virtue. The white house or the Mulvaney comments have certainly added fuel to the fire as far as Democrats are concerned. Both the white house counsel and the department of justice have distanced themselves from Mulvaney's initial remarks and the president not in a hurry to clarify them, Eva. Mulvaney's comments about Ukraine came as he was defending the decision to hold next summer's g7 at the president's own golf course. The house is now taking action on that. Reporter: That's right. House Democrats now plan to hold hearings on that, looking at weather it might violate the emoluments clause, the prohibition against the president profiting from his office.
