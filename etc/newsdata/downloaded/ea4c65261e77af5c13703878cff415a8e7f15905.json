He said gas could be sourced in WA at $3-$4 a gigajoule, while the cost of transporting it would be about $3/GJ, leaving \"a significant margin\" to current east coast wholesale prices that he put at $9-$11/GJ.\n\nBut Mr Barnett's article irked Mr Samter anew, who told clients in an email that the conversation around such a pipeline was \"as embarrassing as it was stupid\" and described the assertion it is nation-building is a \"horse manure concept\".\n\n\"If an LNG import terminal doesn\u2019t pass the 'pub test', as Mr Barnett states, then perhaps he and other policy makers, and plenty of other people of alarming influence that spout nonsense on this topic, need to spend less time in the pub and more time actually understanding the mathematics and mechanics of what they are saying,\" Mr Samter wrote.\n\n\"It is honestly hard to know where to start with why this pipeline is such a ridiculously stupid idea, given how many levels there are at which it is preposterous,\" he continued before pulling apart Mr Barnett's figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Samter said even gas at $4 would be difficult to secure on a 10-year basis, while transportation costs would be closer to $5-$5.50/GJ.\n\nThat very same gas from WA could be liquefied into LNG, shipped and turned back into gas at an import terminal in NSW or Victoria for about $2.50/GJ.\n\n\"That A$2.50-3/GJ differential is a lot of beers you could buy those naysayers in the pub to convince them that imports are a better idea than the pipeline,\" he said.\n\nStill, Mr Walton, basing his comments on Mr Barnett's costings, said reduced energy prices across the east coast would benefit industrials stocks and locally listed energy stocks in which industry super is invested.\n\n\"Investing the savings of working Australians into projects that deliver long-term jobs and job security \u2013 that\u2019s exactly the kind of virtuous cycle industry superannuation is capable of generating and exactly the kind of thing it should be doing more of,\" he said.", "description": "While the country's oldest labour union backs the idea of a $6 billion trans-Australian pipeline, others label it as \"ridiculous\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_78/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/80d920e30b88dffd17a922aabe2af9ee875f283e", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
