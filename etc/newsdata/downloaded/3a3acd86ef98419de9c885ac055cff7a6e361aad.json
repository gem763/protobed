We're unable to restore accounts that are deleted for these types of violations.\"\n\nThe action comes after WhatsApp sued NSO Group on Tuesday for allegedly mass exploiting a critical vulnerability that targeted 1,400 devices with spyware. WhatsApp presented evidence that about 100 of the targets were lawyers, dissidents, human-rights advocates, and other members of civil society. The exploits allowed the attackers to install spyware on iOS and Android phones simply by making a video call to the device.\n\nAccording to WhatsApp, the attackers made the calls from WhatsApp accounts that were created for the purpose of infecting other WhatsApp users. The attackers also relied on WhatsApp servers to communicate with NSO-operated attack servers. The actions, WhatsApp said, violated not just its terms of service, but also the US Computer and Fraud Abuse Act.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks, among other things, a permanent injunction barring all NSO employees from \"accessing or attempting to access WhatsApp's or Facebook's services, platform, and computer systems.\"\n\nA message board popular in Israel indicated that the deletion was widespread. \"I had just personally verified it (I have friends working there),\" one person wrote. \"Ninety-eight percent of the company employees were blocked.\"\n\nAnother person who claimed to work at NSO responded to say he or she hadn't been blocked. Another person claiming to be an NSO employee complained bitterly on LinkedIn. An Israel-based security researcher who spoke to an NSO employee said the deletions affected a much smaller percentage of the company's employees and didn't involve WhatsApp accounts.\n\nWhatsApp representatives declined to comment. NSO representatives didn't immediately respond to an email.", "description": "Deletions come after allegations NSO exploit targeted 1,400 WhatsApp users.", "authors": ["Dan Goodin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/delete-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
