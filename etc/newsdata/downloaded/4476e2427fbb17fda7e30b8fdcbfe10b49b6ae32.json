It\u2019s a bit academic given that the European parliament has already promised to veto it. But I doubt that will prevent Britain from engaging in the pointless process of talking to itself. So hands up at the back now!\n\nWhoever it is will be indulging in a fantasy, as an interesting piece of research published today by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) makes very clear.\n\nThe forecaster has looked at inventory, and how it\u2019s been affected by Brexit and firms\u2019 stockpiling to prepare for a no-deal crash out.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis remains a clear and present danger. Just how much of a danger depends on the view you take of the strength of Benn Act, Boris Johnson\u2019s willingness to break the law of the land, and the possibility that the EU may simply throw its hands in the air and say screw the lot of you. You could hardly blame it for doing that, despite the presence of millions of pro-Europeans on this island who would be let down by such a move.\n\nThe CEBR says that inventories, for example, raw materials held by factories, were little higher than expected at the end of 2018.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They then fell by \u00a33bn in the subsequent quarter. They\u2019ve since started to rise again, for obvious reasons.\n\nThe CEBR thinks about \u00a34bn worth has been added, bringing the total overhang to \u00a311bn above where you\u2019d normally expect (and want) inventories to be in more normal times.\n\nIt bases its conclusions on authoritative business surveys, such as those of put out by the CBI, which regularly asks its members about their inventories.\n\nNow, such stockpiling could be said to help a bit if you\u2019re a no-dealer because, if you ignore businesses warning that such an outcome would be disastrous for everyone, you can pretend they\u2019re prepared.\n\nThat would be a lie because they aren\u2019t. Multiple businesses and business groups say that while they\u2019ve done what they can, such an outcome simply cannot be prepared for. But Brexiteers have never been inclined to let the truth get in the way of what they see as a good story.\n\nWe, however, are looking at a deal outcome.\n\nNow remember, the UK economy shrank in the second quarter of the year, largely because of firms unwinding that \u00a33bn of inventory overhang.\n\nIf a deal is struck, that process will start again. Except that there\u2019ll be a lot more stock to unwind. Worse still, the global economic outlook has detonated since the second quarter, as has that of the UK. Last week I looked at the latest set of Purchasing Managers Index numbers for manufacturing, services and construction, all of which showed contraction.\n\nSo it\u2019s going to be harder to move the excess stock than it was in the second quarter because businesses will be selling into a less buoyant market.\n\nThe upshot of all this? Batten down the hatches because whatever happens we\u2019re likely in for a rough few months. Potentially a very rough few months.\n\nThis only serves to reinforce what I said last week: the opposition should wait as long as it can before granting Boris Johnson an election, so the economic vandalism he and his party have delivered becomes clear to the electorate.", "description": "Who\u2019s going to be the first to start talking about a Brexit \u201cdeal dividend\u201d emerging from\u00a0Boris Johnson\u2019s dismal\u00a0offer?
