If the chamber approves it, it will receive royal assent and pass into the statute books.\n\nApproval shouldn't, in theory, be a problem \u2014 the UK's upper chamber plays the important role of scrutinising new laws but generally approves legislation that the elected Commons passes.\n\nHowever, Brexit-supporting peers in the Lords could attempt to filibuster the legislation, meaning they could try to delay its passage by introducing many amendments and insisting that they are voted on.\n\nConservative peers have tabled more than 85 amendments to disrupt the bill's progress, while Labour colleagues have tried to ensure that attempts to filibuster the legislation are blocked, saying it needs to be dealt with.\n\nThe bill is likely to be passed on Friday. An amended bill would then pass back to the Commons, where it would most likely receive approval early next week.\n\nHow will Johnson react?\n\nThe government is set to table a motion on Wednesday evening asking MPs to approve the election plan.\n\nJohnson has said there are \"no circumstances\" under which he would ask for Brexit to be delayed, with aides insisting that he is being forced into a general election.\n\n\"If Conservative MPs help him to make no-deal illegal tomorrow and therefore create another pointless delay, the government's negotiating position will be wrecked,\" a senior government official said on Monday.\n\n\"In those circumstances, what MPs will effectively be voting for is to hold a rapid election.\"\n\nDowning Street would first seek an election by bringing forward a motion for an early general election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. Under the law, two-thirds of MPs \u2014 434 \u2014 would need to support the prime minister's plan for it to move forward.\n\nThe problem for Johnson is that Labour is likely to reject the plan on Wednesday, insisting that it will not support such a motion until the no-deal legislation has passed into the statute books.\n\nA Downing Street source said on Wednesday that if that happened, the government would simply hold the same vote again early next week after the bill is enacted.", "description": "Boris Johnson was dealt a major blow to his authority on Wednesday as MPs wrested control of Parliament and moved to block a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d700c1a2e22af6d1774ed03?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
