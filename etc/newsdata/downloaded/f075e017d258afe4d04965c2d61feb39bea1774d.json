Trump has been entangled in a web of drama surrounding his phone call with the president of Ukraine in July. Trump confirmed that he asked the Ukrainian president to dig up dirt on former U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\n[Related: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announces impeachment inquiry of President Trump]\n\nMany are now wondering if the possible impeachment of Trump will inject further uncertainty into markets, sending them into a tailspin.\n\nThere have been two instances in U.S. history in which sitting presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson, in 1868, and Bill Clinton, in 1998. Though some analysts are saying that the market reaction following a Trump impeachment could mirror that of Clinton\u2019s, during which markets surged, Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research, argues that fundamentals usually outweigh political events such as impeachment.\n\nEach time is different, according to Dutta.\u201cFor equities, remember we\u2019ve seen something like this twice and had two very different results. During the Nixon saga, stocks were already tumbling (of course, we were going into recession) and kept falling after the formal inquiry process started. During the Clinton impeachment process, markets exploded to the upside as the economy boomed,\u201d Dutta said.\n\nEconomic data\n\nMeanwhile, on the economic data front, the U.S. housing market will take centerstage Wednesday morning when the Census Bureau releases August\u2019s new home sales data.\n\nNew home sales come on the heels of data released Tuesday that showed that U.S. home price growth remained unchanged in July.\n\nEconomists are predicting that new home sales likely rebounded in August to a seasonally adjusted 656,00 units, up from 635,000 units in July.\n\n\u201cNew home sales declined 12.8% in July. We expect a rebound in August and forecast new home sales to rise by 6.1% to a rate of 674,000 units,\u201d Morgan Stanley wrote in a note Friday. \u201cGiven the soft print in August last year, our new forecast would bring sales up by about 11.5% on a year-over-year basis.\u201d\n\nNomura echoed Morgan Stanley\u2019s prediction. \u201cNew home sales likely rebounded 3.9% m-o-m to 660k in August after a sharp 12.8% m-o-m decline in July,\u201d the firm wrote in a note Friday. \u201cThe [National Association of Home Builders\u2019] index for sales of single family homes improved 2pp to 73 in August, the highest reading since October 2018. The improvement in this report seems to have been driven by increased buying interests as long-term interest rates continued to trend lower. While consumers still remain wary of high home prices, we expect lower interest rates to have boosted sales in August.\u201d\n\nNo major corporate earnings announcements are scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
