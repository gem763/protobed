Hunter would often play mandolin and upright bass in Garcia's pre-fame bands.\n\nYet he declined an invitation to join the Grateful Dead, going instead to Stanford University.\n\nThere he volunteered in a government-sponsored psychedelic research program, ingesting hallucinogens including LSD, psilocybin and mescaline.\n\nThe drugs unlocked something in his writing.\n\n\"The words jumped from subconscious to the page,\" he told America's Independent newspaper in 2014. \"It was better than the clicking of typewriter keys.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hunter died peacefully at home, his family said\n\nHunter sent some of his poetry to Garcia, who invited him to become the Grateful Dead's principal lyricist.\n\nHe went on to write some of the Dead's most memorable songs, including Dark Star, Truckin' (\"What a long, strange trip it's been\") and their biggest commercial hit, 1987's Touch of Grey.\n\nThe writing process was fluid. Sometimes Hunter would hand bundles of lyrics to Garcia, who would pick the ones he liked and suggest alterations.\n\nOn other occasions, he would take inspiration from the band's rehearsal tapes - as on Uncle John's Band, which was famously based around a 40-minute instrumental.\n\nHunter's personal favourite line was in Ripple: \"Let it be known there is a fountain that was not made by the hands of men.\"\n\nFull of dream-like, psychedelic imagery, his lyrics were a source of fascination and speculation for Grateful Dead fans.\n\nHunter deliberately forbade the band from publishing his words on their records, adding to the mystery.\n\n\"People could dub in their own mishearings, adding a bit of themselves to the song,\" he explained.\n\n\"I've generally found that the words to songs I thought I heard in the works of others were more colourful and enigmatically apt than the words I eventually discovered were intended.\n\n\"I assume the same is true of my own work.\"\n\nHall of fame\n\nAfter Garcia died in 1995, Hunter worked with the likes of Elvis Costello, Bruce Hornsby and Bob Dylan - with whom he co-wrote the bulk of 2009's Together Through Life album.\n\n\"He's got a way with words and I do too,\" Dylan said at the time. \"We both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting.\"\n\nWhen the Grateful Dead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, Hunter was included as a member of the band.\n\nHe is still the only non-performer to garner such a honour.\n\nHunter's family said he had died \"peacefully at home in his bed, surrounded by love\" on Monday night, with Maureen, his wife of 37 years, holding his hand. No cause of death was given.\n\n\"For his fans that have loved and supported him all these years, take comfort in knowing that his words are all around us, and in that way he is never truly gone,\" the family added.\n\nGrateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir wrote on Twitter: \"If I'm gonna count my blessings, Robert Hunter and his imagination are gonna be up at the top of that list. I think I can speak for a lot of people in saying that.\"\n\n\"He explained the unexplainable and the words struck deep,\" added Hart. \"He spun the stories, and he now rides a carpet headed straight to Jerry.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
