And while the aroma of a pot of perfection simmering away for hours only adds to the joy of soup season as a whole, making a soup from scratch in short time is also delightful! That\u2019s why this recipe from Shane M. Chartrand with Jennifer Cockrall-King\u2019s new cookbook, taw\u00e2w: Progressive Indigenous Cuisine caught our attention. As Chartrand mentions, this soup is particularly a propos for the holidays and is one of his family\u2019s favourites. But in addition to being a marvellous meal for turkey-centric times, one of the beautiful things about this recipe is its simplicity, making it an ideal weeknight meal anytime the cravings for a comforting, brothy bowl arise.\n\nTurkey Neck Soup\n\nBy Shane M. Chartrand\n\nThis is a Chartrand family favourite, especially around Christmas, and we like to get into it\n\nwith our hands: We chew around the cartilage on the neck, and then we just drink the broth.\n\nNo spoons! But obviously eat this however you feel most comfortable.\n\nIngredients\n\n6 turkey necks\n\n8 cups Pheasant Broth or good-quality chicken broth\n\n2 large carrots, roughly chopped\n\n1 large white onion, roughly chopped\n\n5 to 6 cloves garlic, peeled\n\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n\n4 green onions, finely sliced at an angle\n\n\u00bd cup pea shoots\n\nPreparation\n\nCombine the turkey necks, broth, carrots, onion, and garlic in a pressure cooker. Seal the lid and cook for 25 minutes (follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions). Release the steam and open the pressure cooker when safe. If you don\u2019t have a pressure cooker, combine the same ingredients in a soup pot and simmer over medium-low heat for about 2 hours, until the meat comes away from the neck and the vegetables are soft.\n\nSeason the soup with salt and pepper. Garnish with the sliced green onions and pea shoots. Serve in large soup bowls \u2014 with or without a spoon.\n\nYield: Makes 3 to 6 servings\n\nExcerpted from taw\u00e2w: Progressive Indigenous Cuisine copyright \u00a9 Shane M.
