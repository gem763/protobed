TIMES\u2019 ELI STOKOLS: \u201cTrump at private breakfast: \u2018Who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s almost a spy\u2019\u201d: \u201cPresident Trump expressed disgust Thursday morning with the explosive whistleblower complaint, slamming the intelligence officer and those White House aides who helped him or her as \u2018almost a spy\u2019 and suggested it was treason.\n\n\u201cSpeaking at a private breakfast in New York, Trump described reporters as \u2018scum\u2019 and raged at the Democrats\u2019 new impeachment proceedings, which were spurred by the whistle blower\u2019s complaint alleging that Trump tried to strong arm Ukraine\u2019s leader to interfere in the 2020 election. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018I want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u2019 he continued. \u2018You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u2019\u201d LAT\n\n-- NYT\u2019S MAGGIE HABERMAN: \u201cThe remark stunned people in the audience, according to a person briefed on what took place, who had notes of what the president said. Mr. Trump made the statement about several minutes into his remarks before the group of about 50 people at the event intended to honor the United States Mission. At the outset, he condemned the former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s role in Ukraine at a time when his son Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\u201d NYT\n\nTRUMP, speaking to reporters after getting off Air Force One: \u201cWhat these guys, Democrats, are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn\u2019t be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts, but they\u2019re going to tie up our country.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk about gun regulation, we can\u2019t talk about anything because, frankly, they are so tied up, they\u2019re so screwed up, nothing gets done except when I do it. I\u2019m using Mexico to protect our border, because the Democrats won\u2019t change loopholes in asylum.\u201d\n\n-- THERE WAS A WAY OF STOPPING IT: Trump would have none of these problems if Republicans kept the House. Instead, they lost it, and he told us that he thought he would be able to get more done with Democrats. He seems to have miscalculated.\n\nEVERYONE IS GOING TO HAVE their own partisan view of whether TRUMP should or should not be impeached. But Democrats are, in fact, seeking to impeach him, so it\u2019s important to view the whistleblower complaint -- and the letter from Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, which was also released today -- in that light. And, without a doubt, the report and the IG\u2019s letter provide ammo for Democrats.\n\n-- WHY DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IT\u2019S BAD FOR TRUMP: The report alleges that transcripts of some foreign calls that TRUMP made were moved into a secret storage system so people couldn\u2019t see them. The IG report clearly states that the president asked the Ukrainians for help in his reelection campaign. The report implicates RUDY GIULIANI and A.G. BILL BARR.\n\n-- WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE DOING TO TRY TO DISCREDIT THE WHISTLEBLOWER: They\u2019re calling it hearsay and a collection of second- and third-hand accounts. And they\u2019re saying the whistleblower is a partisan. The IG letter \u2026 The whistleblower complaint\n\nACTING DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JOSEPH MAGUIRE was on the Hill this morning, testifying before the House Intel Committee.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW FROM THE HEARING \u2026\n\n-- SIREN \u2026 Rep. JIM HIMES (D-Conn.) got MAGUIRE to dodge questions about whether he spoke to TRUMP about this whistleblower complaint: \u201cMy conversations with the president -- because I am the director of national intelligence -- are privileged.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio) on the TRUMP conversation with the Ukrainian president: \u201cThat conversation is not OK.\u201d\n\n-- MAGUIRE to Rep. DENNY HECK (D-Wash.): \u201cIt is unwarranted, it is unwelcome, it is bad for the nation to have outside interference\u201d in an election.\n\n-- House Intelligence Chairman ADAM SCHIFF (D-Calif.) focused on whether MAGUIRE went to the White House before DOJ to seek guidance on how to deal with the whistleblower complaint. Note: Schiff started the hearing with an imagined conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president. Republicans continually brought this up, saying he was trying to mislead people.\n\n-- Rep. DEVIN NUNES (R-Calif.) focused on leaks -- how the media got hold of the complaint, and who leaked it.\n\n-- MAGUIRE told the committee he never threatened to resign, contradicting a Washington Post story saying he did.\n\n-- Rep. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-Ill.) asked MAGUIRE about GIULIANI. MAGUIRE said all he knows about his role comes from TV and media.\n\n-- MAGUIRE told Rep. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-Texas) that the rough phone call transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, released Wednesday, was \u201cin line\u201d with the whistleblower report.\n\nTHE POLITICO LEDEALL, from Andrew Desiderio and Kyle Cheney\n\nTHE BIGGEST REVELATION \u2026 KYLE CHENEY: \u201cWhistleblower says White House officials tried to \u2018lock down\u2019 details of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call\u201d\n\nA message from Blue Cross Blue Shield Association: We believe everyone should have access to health care, no matter who you are or where you live.

We\u2019ll be talking with House Freedom Caucus Founding Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) on Saturday at 11:15 a.m. Central time.\n\nRON JOHN ALERT! \u2026 BURGESS EVERETT: \u201cRon Johnson troubled by whistleblower allegation of records \u2018lock down\u2019\u201d: \u201cIn an interview, the Wisconsin Republican, pointed to a reporter\u2019s copy of the whistleblower report, singling out page three, which alleged that White House officials treated records of the Zelensky call differently than other calls.\n\n\u201cAccording to the whistleblower complaint, White House officials \u2018had intervened to lock down all records of the phone call\u2019 and were directed to move electronic transcripts to a more secure electronic system. \u2018I would not be happy. We\u2019ll find out exactly what transpired here. To me, of all this stuff, that\u2019s the part that concerns me,\u2019 Johnson said. \u2018I\u2019ve been around the president enough [the call summary] is just classic Trump.\u2019 \u2018I was led to believe [that summary] was all that\u2019s available,\u2019 Johnson added. \u2018I would be a little upset to find out there\u2019s a completely verbatim one.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\nSPEAKER NANCY PELOSI at her weekly news conference said the White House\u2019s reported efforts to \u201clock down\u201d records of the call amounts to a \u201ccover-up.\u201d She added: \u201cWhatever other explanation there might be, an explanation is also that it is a cover-up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow the president thinks this is exculpatory -- maybe he doesn\u2019t know that word -- that the president thinks this proves his innocence,\u201d Pelosi said of Trump\u2019s decision to release a summary of the call, \u201conly goes to further show how further he doesn\u2019t understand right from wrong.\u201d Later: \u201cWe are at a different level of lawlessness that is self-evident to the American people.\u201d\n\nMEANWHILE \u2026 ON TO CINCINNATI: \u201cIn case anyone is interested, we\u2019re moving ahead on USMCA,\u201d Pelosi said, unprompted. \u201cWe hope to be on a continued path to \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d Full news conference\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Bossie served as the chief investigator of the House Oversight Committee in 1997, helping scrutinize [Bill] Clinton.\u201d CNN\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S JONATHAN O\u2019CONNELL and DAVID FAHRENTHOLD: \u201cTrump\u2019s other Ukraine problem: New concern about his business\u201d: \u201cBuried in the controversy over President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was an effort by the Ukrainian leader at currying favor with Trump through his business. \u2018Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,\u2019 Zelensky told Trump, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 call \u2026\n\n\u201cZelensky\u2019s comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him about it.\u201d WaPo\n\nMBS SPEAKS -- \u201cSaudi Prince Accepts Responsibility for Khashoggi Killing, but Denies Involvement,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Ben Hubbard in Beirut, Lebanon: \u201cThe crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, said he bears \u2018all the responsibility\u2019 for the killing of a dissident writer by Saudi agents in Istanbul last year, but denied he had prior knowledge of the plot \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018It happened under my watch,\u2019 Prince Mohammed told Martin Smith, a reporter for the PBS program Frontline, according to a trailer released on Tuesday for a documentary to be aired on Oct. 1. \u2018I get all the responsibility.

Hawley joined Sen. Ted Cruz in opposition. Hawley began informing colleagues of his decision on Thursday morning \u2026\n\n\u201cOzerden is a friend of acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and has been strongly supported by both Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.). But conservatives have been skeptical of his credentials, specifically his ruling in favor of dismissing a challenge to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception coverage mandate, which he deemed premature.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTHERE\u2019S STILL LEGISLATING HAPPENING! -- \u201cMarijuana expected to get traction in Senate \u2014 as a banking bill,\u201d by Natalie Fertig and Zach Warmbrodt: \u201cThe Senate is poised to take up legislation to boost the nation\u2019s booming cannabis industry, with its backers feeling bullish and selling it as a bill that is more about banking than marijuana.\n\n\u201cTheir confidence follows action in the House on Wednesday, where Democrats and Republicans joined forces to pass an historic bill that would give legalized marijuana businesses access to banking services. \u2026 The strongest indicator has come from the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who after months of weighing the issue said he wants to advance the legislation.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTRUMP VS.
