It will leave the American people and homeland less safe, embolden our enemies, and weaken important alliances,\u201d McConnell, R-Ky., writes for The Washington Post. \u201cSadly, the recently announced pullout risks repeating the Obama administration\u2019s reckless withdrawal from Iraq, which facilitated the rise of the Islamic State in the first place.\u201d\n\nTURKEY-SYRIA CEASE-FIRE: SENIOR US MILITARY SOURCES 'HIGHLY SKEPTICAL' OF DEAL\n\nTrump has faced fierce bipartisan criticism for his decision to move U.S. forces from northern Syria, effectively abandoning Kurdish fighters who have long been allied with the U.S. and subsequently clearing the way for an invasion by Turkey, which views the Kurds as terrorists.\n\nBut Trump hailed the move as a \u201ctremendous success\u201d after a cease-fire agreement was secured on Thursday. Turkey's military incursion into northeastern Syria last week, known as Operation Peace Spring, will pause during that time so Kurdish-led forces can pull back from a 20-mile-wide safe zone on the Turkish-Syrian border. The U.S. and Turkey agreed that the military operation will end entirely upon completion of the Kurdish withdrawal, according to the deal.\n\nIn his op-ed, McConnell warns against America abandoning the \u201cmantle of global leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we abandon that mantle today, we can be sure that a new world order will be made \u2014 and not on terms favorable to us,\u201d he said, an apparent reference to fears that Russia will use the U.S. withdrawal to strengthen its foothold in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cEven if the five-day cease-fire announced Thursday holds, events of the past week have set back the United States\u2019 campaign against the Islamic State and other terrorists,\u201d he argues. \u201cUnless halted, our retreat will invite the brutal Assad regime in Syria and its Iranian backers to expand their influence. And we are ignoring Russia\u2019s efforts to leverage its increasingly dominant position in Syria to amass power and influence throughout the Middle East and beyond.\u201d\n\nPELOSI, SCHUMER SAY TRUMP IS 'FLAILING' AFTER CEASE-FIRE DEAL\n\nHe urges the president to keep a \u201climited military presence\u201d in Syria, as well as maintaining U.S. presence in both Iraq and Afghanistan, before taking a shot at President Trump\u2019s comments about ending \u201cendless wars\u201d by arguing that wars do not end, but are only won or lost.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s wars will be \u201cendless\u201d only if America refuses to win them,\u201d he writes.\n\nThose concerns have been shared by other hawkish GOP senators, including Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who said that the withdrawal strengthens Iran, Russia and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This is a foreign policy diaster,\" he said.\n\nTrump, however, has pushed back against that criticism, and on Friday night, urged Americans to \"think of how many lives we saved in Syria and Turkey by getting a ceasefire yesterday.\"\n\n\"Thousands and thousands, and maybe many more!\" he tweeted.\n\nFox News' Jennifer Griffin and Melissa Leon contributed to this report.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rebuked President Trump\u2019s withdrawal of troops from Syria on Friday, calling it a \u201cgrave strategic mistake\u201d in an op-ed that claimed the move had set back the U.S. fight against Islamic terrorism in the region.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/09/694940094001_6070328671001_6070323154001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
