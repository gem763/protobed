(Lintao Zhang/Getty Images)\n\nThough Japan has yet to win a game in the FIBA World Cup, Rui Hachimura has more than stood out.\n\nThe former Gonzaga star and No. 9 overall draft pick dropped a team-high 15 points and grabbed seven rebounds in their opening-game loss to Turkey, and then led the Japanese with 21 points and six rebounds while shooting 8-of-12 from the field in their loss to the Czech Republic on Tuesday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhile the team can\u2019t advance past the group stage with their first two losses on the books, Hachimura said he\u2019s loved the experience \u2014 and can tell his game and his confidence have benefitted, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been crazy,\u201d Hachimura said, via the Associated Press. \u201cI got drafted, went to D.C. and we had like a minicamp, then summer league and now the World Cup. It\u2019s been a crazy summer, but I\u2019ve been having fun with this experience, this process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played a lot of games this summer, everywhere. I don\u2019t know how much I grew, but I have more confidence.\u201d\n\nJapan will take on the United States \u2014 who just narrowly escaped Turkey in overtime on Tuesday \u2014 on Thursday for their final group game, providing Hachimura an opportunity to go against fellow NBA players yet another time before heading back across the Pacific Ocean to start getting ready for the season.\n\nThough the Wizards are likely very ready to get Hachimura back, general manager Tommy Sheppard has been with him every step of the way this summer. He flew to Japan for their pre-tournament games, and then over to China to watch the team compete in the World Cup.\n\nSo far, he likes what he sees.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a really nice player in the NBA,\u201d Sheppard said, via the Associated Press. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot \u2014 a lot \u2014 of upside. He\u2019s got a lot of learning to do, but he\u2019s got excellent skill and excellent will ... It just takes time, and we have to develop that.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Hachimura and Japan will take on the United States next on Thursday, still looking for their first win in China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lsSqUkEEJPVJ9mXN62ceHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hnzMD.nZmNDAMEDOJ5OYHg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/1dd8bf00-ce45-11e9-bbbf-2a142c9ddf0d"}
