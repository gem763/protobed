Parents were given access to lesson plans.\n\nI strongly encourage you to follow that lesson plans link. To the school\u2019s credit, they aren\u2019t hiding anything. This is the conceptual vocabulary that kids in pre-K, elementary, and middle school will be learning this week:\n\nUnbelievable. They are teaching kindergartners in public school about the basics of LGBT activism. In first grade, they will be training these kids in the basic of transgender theory. Second and third graders will be writing gender ideology fairy tales for the little kids. And on and on. Middle schoolers will be compelled by their public school to embrace LGBT activism.\n\nFor the teachers, this background:\n\nMore info for the teachers:\n\nThere\u2019s more. Here\u2019s a guide for how teachers are to handle parents who object:\n\nThis is the lie they always tell: that this is only about being nice and respectful. Because compelling middle schoolers to make activist posters is so necessary to learning tolerance.\n\nI invite you to read all the lesson plans.\n\nDistrict 65 is in a deeply blue (as in liberal) part of the country, so not typical. But if this isn\u2019t in your public school district now, give it time. You conservative Christian parents who insist that your kid has to remain in public school to \u201cbe salt and light\u201d are going to need to up your game.\n\nSt. Benedict, in his Rule, said that the monastery is a \u201cschool for the Lord\u2019s service.\u201d US public schools are becoming training facilities for propaganda and social justice activism. Read the lesson plans and see for yourself. They are feeding gender ideology to kindergartners. Even the special ed kids have to learn how to salute the rainbow flag.\n\n(Thanks to the Chicagoland reader who tipped me off.)", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-7.39.22-PM-e1570581674159.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
