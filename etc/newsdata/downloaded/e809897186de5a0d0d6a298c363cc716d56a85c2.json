The cast members, who are all smiling from ear-to-ear in the snap, cram into the frame in front of a table as Aniston takes the selfie.\n\n\u201cAnd now we\u2019re Instagram FRIENDS too,\u201d Aniston wrote. \u201cHI INSTAGRAM!\u201d\n\n\"The Morning Show\u201d star\u2019s fellow celebrities were quick to comment on her first foray into the Instagram life.\n\n\u201cYASSSS!!! Welcome to Insta Jen!!!\u201d wrote actress Reese Witherspoon.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah tushy!\u201d Chelsea Handler commented.\n\n\u201cFINALLY\u201d wrote Olivia Wilde.\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON BASHES MARVEL: I'M NOT INTERESTED IN 'LIVING IN A GREEN SCREEN'\n\nAniston\u2019s ex-husband, Justin Theroux, was among the first to comment, simply writing: \u201cWoot-Woot!\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFriends\u201d gang are no strangers to off-camera reunions. Earlier this week, Aniston admitted that they still hang out all the time. Appearing on \"The Howard Stern Show,\" she said she had dinner with \"the whole gang\" over the weekend.\n\n\"We just had dinner on Saturday. Yeah, the whole gang, everyone was there. [David] Schwimmer was in town and we all happened to have a window of time so we all got together,\" Aniston said.\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON SAYS A \u2018PAINFULLY WORDED\u2019 CRITICISM AT AGE 11 GAVE HER A VOICE\n\nShe added: \"We laughed so hard.\"\n\nCox hosted the reunion at her house and the 55-year-old shared a selfie of herself with Aniston and LeBlanc.\n\n\"A rare night and I love it,\" Cox captioned the picture.\n\nThe three stars\u2019 clothes look different in Cox\u2019s photo, meaning that Aniston\u2019s snap likely took place on a different night.\n\nUnfortunately for fans of the beloved sitcom, the cast getting back together likely doesn\u2019t mean that the show will be returning in any form. The series\u2019 co-creators recently dashed all hopes while speaking at the Tribeca TV Festival.\n\n\u201cWe will not be doing a reunion show, we will not be doing a reboot,\" co-creator and executive producer Marta Kauffman said, according to Deadline.\n\n\"The show was about that time in life when friends are your family,\u201d she added.\n\nShe reasoned that a continuation of the series is \"not going to beat what we did.\u201d\n\nCo-creator and executive producer David Crane agreed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe did the show we wanted to do. We got it right, and we put a bow on it,\" he added.\n\nFox News' Sasha Savitsky and Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "Jennifer Aniston made her Instagram debut on Tuesday, marking the occasion with a rare snap of herself\u00a0reuniting with the full cast of \u201cFriends.\u201d", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/friends-cast-getty-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
