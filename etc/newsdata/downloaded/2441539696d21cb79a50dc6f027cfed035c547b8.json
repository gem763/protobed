Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has resurfaced, showing the then-Senate candidate claiming to possess \u201cplenty of pictures\u201d highlighting her Native American heritage.\n\nA reporter asked Warren in the 2012 video if she possessed \u201canything in the house that reflects her Native American heritage.\u201d Warren said she did, but refused to show the items.\n\n\u201cI have plenty of pictures. They\u2019re not for you,\u201d Warren replied:\n\nAnother resurfaced clip shows Warren doubling down on her Native ancestry claims, telling the story of her parents. She claimed her family was divided due to her father\u2019s parents\u2019 prejudice against her mother, who was \u2013 Warren claimed \u2013 part Cherokee and Delaware.\n\n\u201cIt was an issue in our family the whole time I grew up, about these two families,\u201d Warren told New England Cable News\u2019s Jim Braude.\n\nBraude followed up, asking Warren \u2013 who identified as a minority \u2013 if she would still identify as such if her ancestors were black instead.\n\n\u201cIf your family heritage had an African American like you have, the grandfather or great grandparent who was a Cherokee, would you call yourself a black, and expect African Americans to accept that?\u201d Braude asked.\n\n\u201cIf that same ancestor was black and not Cherokee,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf my Father\u2019s parents had said, \u2018You can\u2019t marry her because she\u2019s black, and that had been part of our family growing up, that we had two different families?\u201d Warren replied.\n\n\u201cYou would be comfortable with saying you\u2019re black?\u201d Braude asked.\n\n\u201cIt would be part of identification,\u201d she said:\n\nElizabeth Warren says her parents had to elope because she was part Cherokee and part Delaware. This entire situation is worse than I had thought. pic.twitter.com/E87HDB3Qqo \u2014 \ud83c\udf39 (@AlytaDeLeon) September 28, 2019\n\nThe Massachusetts senator has been under fire for identifying as a minority in the past, listing herself as a minority professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Harvard Law School. She also claimed Native American heritage on her Texas Bar registration card:\n\nElizabeth Warren filled out a form for the State Bar of Texas in 1986 claiming American Indian heritage, according to documents reviewed by The Post https://t.co/YQjkCIxkDt \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) February 6, 2019\n\nWarren has tried to put her claims of Native American heritage behind her, but a DNA test \u2013 taken last year \u2013 revealed that Warren had between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry. The results followed years of Warren\u2019s claims of Native American heritage, citing her high cheekbones as physical proof. Additionally, the DNA results indicated an association with individuals from Colombia, Mexico, and Peru\u2013 not Native American tribes in the United States, further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage, specifically.\n\nWarren has since admitted that she is \u201cnot a person of color\u201d and \u201cnot a citizen of a tribe\u201d and has called her decision to identify as a minority for years on end a \u201cmistake,\u201d although she has yet to offer a detailed explanation for making the claims for years without solid proof.\n\n\u201cLike anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,\u201d Warren told the crowd at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have listened and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations we have had together,\u201d she added:\n\nPresident Trump joked at a rally in August that he \u201cdid the Pocahontas thing\u201d a bit too early but signaled that he will revive it if Warren scores the Democrat nomination.\n\n\u201cI did the Pocahontas thing. I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago,\u201d told the crowd in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI should have waited. But don\u2019t worry, we will revive it. It can be revived. It will be revived. And it can be revived very easily, and very quickly, and we\u2019re gonna have some fun in the state of New Hampshire,\u201d he added.", "description": "A video of Warren has resurfaced, showing her claiming to possess \"plenty of pictures\" highlighting her Native American heritage.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/Elizabeth-Warren-Pocahontas.Painting-of-Pocahontas-around-the-time-of-her-wedding-to-John-Rolfe.-Three-LionsGetty-Imagesjpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
