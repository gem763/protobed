They're Essential.", "language": "en", "text": "There was once a time when I was robeless. Now, I have three: a summer, a spring/fall, and a winter one. They\u2019re all different weights and materials, but they all make me feel good when I wear them. I\u2019ve seen a lot of robes splashed across Instagram and the rest of social media, and I\u2019m here to give you a lesson on them.\n\nA robe should feel like a full-on blanket with a belt, in my opinion. There is a time and place for thin robes (right out of the shower and in the bathroom), but you don\u2019t always need the waffle or terrycloth ones. Sometimes, you need, nay deserve more. Whichever style you choose, enjoy wearing it every time you tie that waist belt.\n\nHomecoat, $295 at OffHours: The ultimate blanket robe is the Homecoat from OffHours. It\u2019s basically a comforter that ties around your waist that comes in a ton of colors. Because it only comes in one size, it can fit a plethora of people.\n\n300-Thread Count Sateen Down Robe, $225 at The Company Store: Another good option is this one from the Company Store, which has the same general idea as the OffHours robe, but for half the price. This one takes 550-fill power down and fills a quilted sateen cover, throws a shawl collar on it, and calls it a day.\n\nNatori Sherpa Robe, $130 at Zappos: This is my kind of robe. The Natori sherpa robe is fuzzy inside and out and goes almost down to the floor. The white cuffs give it an extra punch of sophistication.\n\nUGG Men's Kalib Sherpa-Lined Plaid Robe, $165 at Bergdorf Goodman: Most men's robes won't be fully fuzzy, but will have a soft interior lining. This one from UGG has the iconic plaid outside, but has a fluffy, faux sherpa inside that will keep you warm even as the temperatures drop.\n\nHoneycomb Bathrobe, $98 at Snowe: Technically, the Snowe Honeycomb robe isn\u2019t waffle, but an upgraded version of the classic robe pattern. Fast-drying and lightweight, the Honeycomb robe is made from 100% Organic Long-Staple Cotton and is just the thing you\u2019ll want to put on as you step out of the shower.\n\nWaffle Robe, $119 at Parachute: Parachute\u2019s classic waffle knit robe is 100% Turkish cotton, machine washable, and easy to wear for the hours you end up lounging basically naked out of the shower before wanting to put clothing on.\n\nMen's Terry Cloth Robe, $70 at L.L.Bean: Terrycloth is the classic robe. It\u2019s the hotel robe you always consider stealing. The LL.Bean Terry Cloth Robe comes in many different colors, but if you want full \u201890s sitcom dad, get the Dark Steel Blue.\n\nClassic Bathrobe, $99 at Parachute: No shame in mentioning Parachute again, because their Classic Bathrobe has been on Best Of lists since it was first introduced. The large, slouchy pockets in front can fit phones, tablets, newspapers, and more.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
