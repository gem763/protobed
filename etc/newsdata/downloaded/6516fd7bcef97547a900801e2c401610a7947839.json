Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix and everyone involved told a mesmerizing, highly original, and unforgettable story that could not be denied, even in the face of a ton of bigoted and racist hot takes that used the movie to slander and smear single, white men; that used the movie to try and provoke an act of violence in a theater playing Joker, so that this act of violence could be used as an excuse to launch another round of hot takes slandering and smearing single, white men.\n\nBut how big of a failure was this\u2026?\n\nTo begin with, after four weekends in release, Joker will probably be number-one again at the domestic box office this weekend.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the math\u2026\n\nFor simplicity sake, let\u2019s assume Joker will reach a worldwide gross of $900 million, which is certainly possible. Further, let\u2019s assume the average worldwide ticket price is $9, even though it is probably lower. What that means is that Joker has sold over 100 million admissions. Think about that\u2026\n\nFigure that with repeat customers (I saw it twice), that over 75 million different people paid to see Joker, sat in a darkened theater to watch a movie the experts assured us would provoke catastrophic violence, that the elite practically begged for violence to occur so they could prove a political point, and not one drop of blood was lost, not one punch thrown, not one knife brandished, not once incident of violence.\n\nAnd we know this failure was not due to a lack of scrutiny. How do we know that? The fact that a couple of idiots were arrested at a Joker screening for smoking cigarettes and \u201ccausing loud noises\u201d made the news.\n\nImagine the CNN \u201cBreaking News\u201d headlines if Brett Kavanaugh had been caught looking at his phone at a Joker screening\u2026\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t silly enough, a verbal argument broke out between two customers at an overseas screening, and it made international news.\n\nDo you have any idea how many arguments I\u2019ve seen break out in movie theaters? I\u2019ve gotten in a couple myself. I\u2019ve seen at least three fistfights, and if you want to count the drive-in, I\u2019ve been in one (and lost horribly).\n\nSo what you have here is the entire worldwide media on alert for any kind of teensy-weensy-little-itty-bitty-microscopic Joker story they can find, and this is all they got.\n\nPathetic.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
