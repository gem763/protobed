Its circulation had fallen from more than 100,000 in the 1990s to just over 57,000 when it closed its doors.\n\nFast forward to this week. ACP's portfolio of magazines has been owned since 2012 by German media company Bauer Media, which bought it off Nine for $500 million. And Bauer has now agreed to take on Seven West Media's Pacific Magazines for $40 million.\n\nThere will always be a place for magazines, but it\u2019s a classic case, they were too scared to move for too long. \u2014 Former magazine executive\n\n\"There will always be a place for magazines, but it\u2019s a classic case, they were too scared to move for too long. Because they had the cover price and ad revenue they never really got comfortable putting content up for free,\" a former magazine executive said.\n\n\"When people starting getting comfortable paying for content, they missed that moment.\"\n\nAs one high-profile reality television series drew to a close in mid-2018, it was clear that the contestants' preferred publicity outlets were changing and this trend was taking a toll on the Australian magazine industry.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to do the big magazine tell-all spread. They're focused on Instagram and want deals to boost their followers,\u201d one senior media executive bemoaned.\n\nThe older half of Gen Y looks to have been the last group of consumers to spend their pocket change at newsagencies on titles like Cleo, Cosmo, Men's Style, Zoo, FHM and Ralph.\n\nThe world has gone online and the demise of The Bulletin - which couldn't command advertising like magazine genres such as fashion, beauty, home improvement, automotive - was a sign of things to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the future of magazines? There will clearly be categories that will struggle to exist in the Australian landscape. US celebrity gossip and softcore porn magazines have no future in the era of the internet - Bauer closed softcore titles The People and Picture after major service stations BP and 7Eleven banned the magazines.\n\nBauer Media's new local chief executive Brendon Hill remains bullish about the future of the business with the consolidated portfolio from PacMags.\n\n\"This deal has a lot to do with our competitive landscape and the need to have scale to compete with digital businesses globally,\" Hill said when the deal was announced.\n\nHe indicated that Bauer had no plans to close PacMag titles, stating \"the magazines all operate wonderfully now \u2013 I don't see them changing under one roof\".\n\nNew Idea has grown its audience in recent times.\n\nThe Bauer boss declined to comment for this story as the company awaits approval for the PacMags deal from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\n\nSources with an understanding of the magazine supply chain estimated Bauer would get its money back on the PacMags deal within two years with synergies in areas like sales, printing and distribution.\n\nPacMags' better-known titles, such as New Idea and Betters Homes and Gardens, actually have growing digital audiences. Bauer just needs to figure out what new areas it can build revenues in with those audiences to offset the permanent structural decline of magazines.\n\nPacMags' New Idea had a larger total audience in July compared with October 2018, according to Enhanced Media Metrics Australia (EMMA) data. A year-on-year comparison was unavailable due to a change in data collection methodology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile New Idea's monthly print audience fell from 2.64 million in October 2018 to 2.46 million in July, its digital audience rose from 1.07 million to 1.49 million \u2013 making it the second-largest monthly digital magazine audience behind News Corp's Taste.com.au. This meant the magazine's total audience rose from 3.5 million in October 2018 to 3.7 million in July.\n\nBetter Homes and Gardens also grew its digital audience in the same period from 502,000 to 571,000, although print declines outpaced digital growth.\n\nAccording to EMMA and Nielsen data, Bauer and PacMags had a combined print and digital audience of 7.9 million people aged 14 and over in July.\n\nNews Corp Australia executive Nicholas Gray, who is managing director of The Australian, the company's NSW newspapers, and Prestige titles - including Vogue and GQ - believes in the future of magazines.\n\nBut Gray says the relationship with advertisers has changed, and there needs to be more on offer.\n\nHe said the strategy for News Corp's magazines was to build significant cross-platform audiences to help them create deeper advertising relationships than those that existed in the old world.\n\n\"The best example with Vogue is American Express who are clearly tied to the success of the retail market and one of their focus areas is fashion luxury retail,\" he said.\n\nTo that end, Vogue set up Fashion Night Out in Melbourne and Sydney, working with merchants, creating integrated content and bringing Vogue readers into the shopping precincts of Burke St and Pitt St.\n\n\"Advertisers aren\u2019t just looking to buy simple display inventory or magazines pages. To grow revenues for magazines you not only have to deliver a great print product but a compelling digital and experiential offering and deeper integration for advertisers for those experiences,\" Gray said.\n\n\"You have to have a lot more arrows in your quiver. You can\u2019t just do a monthly magazine and a daily website. You have to have extensions, live events, compelling social distribution, build big Instagram audiences, monetise those, engage with the tech titans on their platforms provided the economics are right.\n\n\"That\u2019s the challenge, the revenue is there. You need to do a lot of things well to win that and with the cost of doing things well across a lot of channels, you need to think carefully where you spend your money.\"", "description": "Glossy magazine pages were once the shining jewels of media empires bringing in major advertising dollars.
