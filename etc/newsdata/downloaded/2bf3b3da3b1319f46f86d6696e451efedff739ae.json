She\u2019s a mom of three children \u2014 what example is this setting to her three children? \u2026 It just seems wrong. I don\u2019t understand why when something seems so simple to us.\u201d\n\nPolice say Mrs. Sacoolas was driving 60 miles an hour the wrong way down a road outside a military installation Aug. 27 when she collided with Dunn on his motorcycle, killing him, according to The New York Times.\n\nMrs. Sacoolas made the investigation more complicated when she invoked diplomatic immunity and left the country despite telling British authorities earlier on that she did not plan to do so.\n\nAs the U.S. Embassy in London said it wouldn\u2019t get involved, Dunn\u2019s parents \u2014 Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn \u2014 traveled to Washington to press personally for Mrs. Sacoolas\u2018 return to the U.K.\n\nDuring their visit, the parents were invited to the White House and met with President Trump, where the family\u2019s spokesperson said they were \u201cambushed\u201d with the opportunity to meet Mrs. Sacoolas publicly and in front of the White House press corps.\n\nDunn\u2019s family declined, having previously stated they would only meet with her on U.K. soil.\n\nWhile Mrs. Sacoolas has yet to respond to the lawsuit, her lawyer, Amy Jeffress, issued a statement on her behalf apologizing for the case and adding that the media is reporting it wrong.\n\n\u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident,\u201d the statement says, according to The Daily Beast. \u201cNo loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
