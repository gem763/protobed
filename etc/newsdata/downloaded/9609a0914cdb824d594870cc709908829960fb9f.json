To others it\u2019s Infiernillo, which means Little Hell.\n\nSuch colorful nicknames refer to more than just the scorching climate: the Hot Land is also the newest front line in the Mexican Drug War.\n\nRunning through southwestern Guerrero state, where 43 students disappeared in September of 2014, the infernal vale encompasses some of the deadliest country in the hemisphere.\n\nWhile other major cartel umbrella groups\u2014like Chapo Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel federation\u2014have been weakened by loss of leadership and infighting over the last year, intelligence reports show dozens of drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) in Tierra Caliente growing stronger in 2016.\n\nAnd with good reason. Tierra Caliente has already eclipsed Mexico\u2019s famous \u201cGolden Triangle\u201d as the prime heroin production zone, with most of the smack headed straight for the booming U.S. market.\n\nAll that heroin-derived revenue allows the Hot Land\u2019s cartels to prey, vampire-like, on the region\u2019s farmers, business owners, and politicians. The gangs\u2019 preferred terror tactics include kidnapping, extortion, rape, murder, and even organ trafficking.\n\nIn just the last three months, there have been more than 340 murders in Tierra Caliente and neighboring municipalities. In January alone, authorities recorded at least 35 \u201cforced disappearances,\u201d including several children, causing schools to close throughout the region.\n\nIn addition to targeting civilians, local gangs also engage in bloody, shockingly brutal turf wars. As the narcos duke it out over local drug-production plazas, innocent civilians are often caught up in the chaos.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a human-rights crisis in Tierra Caliente, and it\u2019s not being attended to,\u201d says Laura Carlsen, director of the Mexico City-based Americas Program, in an interview with The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in Mexico for 30 years,\u201d Carlsen says, \u201cBut I never imagined that we could see the levels of violence happening now.\u201d\n\nThe rugged mountain ranges on either side of Tierra Caliente tend to soak up most of the rainfall, leading to the desert-like conditions in the valley below. The nearby high country also provides excellent cover for the mass production of opium and heroin, as well as crystal meth.\n\nUnlike local rainfall, illicit drugs do flow all the way downhill into the Hot Land, as traffickers prefer to move their product out along the flat, paved valley roads. Conflict over these shipping routes can be fierce. According to Carlsen, whole villages have been displaced, as the regional mafias struggle for dominance.\n\nThese new gangs have names like Los Rojos (The Reds), Guerreros Unidos (Warrior\u2019s United) and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. And those upstart DTOs have a different, far more violent ethos than the old cartel vanguard, which was personified by Chapo Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nOne disturbingly common tactic in Tierra Caliente is skinning off victims\u2019 faces while they\u2019re still alive. Other go-to moves out of the cartel playbook include using chain saws and other power tools as torture devices, ISIS-style beheadings, and dissolving people in vats of acid.\n\nMany experts believe the increased violence in places like Tierra Caliente is indicative of the failure of the DEA-sponsored \u201cKingpin Strategy,\u201d which emphasizes hunting down high-ranking cartel leaders, as opposed to stressing interdiction efforts.\n\nOnce a given crime lord is taken down, critics say, it almost always touches off a battle among his seconds and lieutenants, as they seek to take over and gain power for themselves.\n\n\u201cWhen a cartel divides and forms new groups\u2014well, those new groups need to find sources of income,\u201d says Mayra Jim\u00e9nez, an independent Mexican journalist who has covered the Tierra Caliente region for more than a decade. \u201cThat drives them to take over new plazas, and to extort and kidnap people in them.\u201d\n\nFor example, some of the most powerful cartels in Guerrero\u2014including the Rojos and the Guerreros Unidos\u2014are splinters of the Beltran-Leyva organization, which the Mexican government took down in 2011.\n\nCompetition among such factions has led directly to the new, no-holds-barred tactics.\n\nTurf wars have become more violent, as each group seeks to send a message about \u201cwho\u2019s the toughest dog on the block,\u201d says America\u2019s Program Director Carlsen, who just returned from a research trip to Tierra Caliente.\n\nAll those dog fights have taken a drastic toll on the quality of every-day life.\n\n\u201cCartel activity really restricts freedom of movement,\u201d says reporter Jim\u00e9nez. \u201cPeople know they can\u2019t be out on the street after 6 or 7 at night. And even during the day, the roads aren\u2019t safe.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the cartels are suppressing freedom of the press.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t even write about what the narcos are doing without putting ourselves at risk,\u201d says Jim\u00e9nez, who also lives in the Tierra Caliente. \u201cIf you say something they don\u2019t like, they\u2019ll hunt you down and kill you. Or they\u2019ll hunt down your family.\u201d\n\nAs with so many places in Mexico, authorities seem helpless to curb the violence. A major government offensive in 2014 established a powerful police and military presence in this little inferno, complete with scores of stop-and-search checkpoints. But the number of killings, abductions, and other crimes has actually surged during the occupation\u2014as has drug production.\n\n\u201cA real question is raised here,\u201d says Carlsen. \u201cIf the federal government is in charge\u2014why is the violence [in Tierra Caliente] on the rise?\u201d\n\nCarlsen hints at a dark, \u201cdeductive\u201d answer to her own question: that federal forces in the area are \u201ccomplicit with the cartels.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll access roads are controlled by the military, yet there\u2019s still a huge flow of drugs,\u201d says Carlsen.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility of the state to guarantee human rights and security\u2014is simply not being met,\u201d she says.", "description": "As the \u2018kingpins\u2019 get picked off, in the valley known as Tierra Caliente a new generation of hyper-violent cartel killers is making El Chapo look almost benign.", "authors": ["Jeremy Kryt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492120409/articles/2016/01/31/the-young-drug-lords-fighting-for-el-chapo-s-throne/160130-kryt-mexico-cartel-tease_ucq5oz", "published_at": "2016-01-31"}
