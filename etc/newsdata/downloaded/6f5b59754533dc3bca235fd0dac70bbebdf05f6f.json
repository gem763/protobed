It will consider whether and how the project should proceed.\n\nIf the project goes ahead, a new HS2 station would be built next to Manchester Piccadilly as part of the second phase - from Crewe to Manchester and the West Midlands to Leeds.\n\nThe programme originally began under the Labour government in 2009. It is the second High Speed rail project after High Speed 1, which links St Pancras International and the Channel Tunnel, and opened in 2003.\n\nImage copyright Bennetts Associates Image caption HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof\n\nWhen will it open and how much will it cost?\n\nGovernment officials have refused to rule out scrapping the project entirely, despite delays and billions having been spent already.\n\nThe first phase of the railway - between London and Birmingham - was due to open at the end of 2026.\n\nImage copyright Siemens/ PA Image caption A proposed design for an HS2 train\n\nBut Transport minister Grant Shapps said in a written statement to Parliament that it could now be 2028-2031 before the first trains run on the route.\n\nThe second phase to Manchester and Leeds was due to open in 2032-33, but that has been pushed back to 2035-2040.\n\nMr Shapps also said the cost of HS2 had risen from \u00a362bn to between \u00a381bn and \u00a388bn. This is up from \u00a356bn in 2015 prices.\n\nWhat about journey times?\n\nThe Department for Transport says the project will cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes to 52 minutes.\n\nOnce the second phase is complete, Manchester to London journeys would take one hour seven minutes (down from two hours seven minutes), and Birmingham to Leeds 49 minutes (down from two hours). This would effectively reduce journey times between London and Edinburgh and Glasgow by an hour to three-and-a-half hours.\n\nThe government hopes its creation will free up capacity on overcrowded commuter routes.\n\nWhat about fares?\n\nThere has been no announcement on ticket prices.\n\nThe government previously said its proposals \"assume a fares structure in line with that of the existing railway\" and that HS2 could generate sufficient demand and revenue without needing to charge premium fares. It originally estimated total fare revenues of up to \u00a334bn over a 60-year period.\n\nWhat about opposition to HS2?\n\nSome MPs argued that the construction of HS2 would create thousands of jobs.\n\nOthers believe that it could be a catalyst for economic growth and could help rebalance the economy between the North and South.\n\nImage caption The plan has attracted fierce criticism from some of those living on the intended route\n\nHowever, HS2 will pass through about 70 parliamentary constituencies, and local groups opposed to the scheme are lobbying their MPs to vote against the plans.\n\nThere is political pressure on some Conservative MPs in particular, some of whom oppose the project as the route will pass through their constituencies,\n\nPressure group Stop HS2 believes that the operation of the line will cause increasing carbon emissions, as well as damage to areas of natural beauty and the ecosystems they support.\n\nIt has also accused HS2 of \"sending out possession orders like there is no tomorrow\", referring to the compulsory purchase of properties in the path of the line.\n\nHS2 Action Alliance has previously argued that it believes a disproportionate number of the 30,000 jobs created around HS2 stations in phase one will be in London.", "description": "Part one of the high-speed railway between London, the Midlands and North of England is due to open in 2026.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D80D/production/_108390355_gettyimages-615359306.jpg"}
