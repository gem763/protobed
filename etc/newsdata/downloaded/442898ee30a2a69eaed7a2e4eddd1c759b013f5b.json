The tech roster consists of angel investor Brad O\u2019Neill, whose company TechValidate was sold to SVMK Inc. SVMK, -5.05% ; Charles Jolley, who sold two companies to Facebook Inc. FB, -2.38% ; and Stephen Stokols, co-founder of FreedomPop, a wireless Internet and mobile virtual network operator.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge market for anyone who wants to participate in a pickup game on a nice indoor court with nets,\u201d Stokols told MarketWatch.", "description": "An all-star team of former NBA players and tech entrepreneurs have developed an app that is the equivalent of Airbnb for pick-up basketball games.", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT659_hoops1_ZG_20191020161511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
