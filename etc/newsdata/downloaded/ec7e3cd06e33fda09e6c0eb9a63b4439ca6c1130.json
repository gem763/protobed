It was followed by a noh masked theater performance with a parent-child succession of lions as its theme.\n\nNomura Mansai, 53, of kyogen comedy, Ichikawa Ebizo, 41, of kabuki theater, and Yoshida Tamao, 66, of bunraku puppet theater, together performed \"Sambaso,\" a play for celebratory occasions in which actors dance as an expression of wishes for a rich harvest.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe gives a speech during the banquet for foreign dignitaries at a Tokyo hotel on Wednesday night.

The play is based on a legend in which a father lion deliberately pushes his cub into a ravine to force him to crawl back up and become stronger.\n\nNoh and kyogen were established around the 14th century, while Kabuki traces its origin to dance from the early 17th century. Bunraku evolved from puppet plays of the late 17th century.\n\nMansai, who is also a supervisor for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, said the banquet's basic concepts of diversity and coexistence represent what he wishes to convey at the sporting events.\n\nIn a speech at the event, Abe pledged to contribute to world peace, touching on the start of the new era.\n\n\"We are determined to further contribute to the promotion of world peace and prosperity, as well as mutual understanding, in this Reiwa era by going hand in hand with the international community,\" Abe told the attendees.\n\nThe banquet held in 1990 to celebrate former Emperor Akihito's enthronement also featured kabuki and noh performances.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Foreign dignitaries enjoyed a rare joint show of Japanese traditional arts on Wednesday at a banquet following the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Naruhito the previous day.
