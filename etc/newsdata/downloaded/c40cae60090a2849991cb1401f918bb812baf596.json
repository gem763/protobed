The Russian said she only did it because she knew that her persecution was politically motivated and a fair trial was impossible.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing is the US Marshals Services where they humiliate you; forbid you from going to the toilet for 16 hours; deny you water or food,\u201d Butina said as she talked to RT and Sputnik news agency on a plane that was taking her from the US back to Moscow. After that a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida seemed like \u201cparadise\u201d for her as she was allowed to go for walks and got a lot better rations.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Like a bad Hollywood flick with allegations as surreal as Alice in Wonderland' - Russia's Butina on US arrest\n\n\u201cI was just a stack of bones,\u201d she recalled, but daily jogging and other exercises helped a lot. \u201cI had problems with my memory, but it returned to me. My eyesight also improved.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still a very tough environment where humiliation of inmates is widespread as some officers treat prisoners \u201cabsolutely terribly.\u201d\n\nButina recalled that just one day before she was to be released, a guard, who became unhappy with how the prisoners were executing their duties in the kitchen, warned them: \"If you will do that again I will f**k each and every one of you.\"\n\nWhen a guard is cursing at you in the most obscene words possible\u2026 It just shouldn\u2019t be like that. We\u2019re women after all.\n\nAt first, the relations with fellow inmates were \u201ctense\u201d after she was transferred from Alexandria to a correctional facility in Tallahassee because \u201ceverybody watched the news\u201d where she was portrayed as a villain, the 30-year-old recalled.\n\nBut that changed quickly when people got to know her. The activist said that a newspaper article in her defense was also passed on inside the prison and after some time \u201ceven some guards were telling me: \u2018It seems that they lied to us on this one.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018It was very hard to bear\u2019: Maria Butina recalls how US media smeared her on TV & prison guards gathered to watch it\n\nWhen she returned to her block after being handed the \u201cshocking\u201d 18-month sentence the girls hugged her, saying \u201cIt\u2019s OK. You\u2019ll get through this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had good relations with the other inmates,\u201d Butina said, also adding that many in prison simply called her \u201cRussia,\u201d instead of using her real name.\n\nThe activist worked in the kitchen in Tallahassee and also volunteered as a math teacher, training inmates for the GED exam. She said she was proud that all of her students passed.\n\nThe US justice system is \u201cvery generous\u201d at handing out sentences as \u201cpeople remain in prison for a long time over the smallest violations. They are just taking their lives away from the girls. No correction is happening, while behind bars.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com US not bad but justice system broken: Butina talks about \u2018terrifying\u2019 solitary confinement, vows to fight for inmates\u2019 rights\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
