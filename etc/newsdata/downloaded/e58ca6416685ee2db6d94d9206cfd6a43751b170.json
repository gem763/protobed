This year the league\u2019s MVP is completely healthy and raring to win her first title. She\u2019s got help as Emma Meesseman, who missed the 2018 season while preparing for the Women\u2019s World Cup with Belgium is back.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have Emma. We\u2019re a different team when she\u2019s on it,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cWe got a really good Connecticut team coming in. They are playing really great basketball. We\u2019ll focus on them and figure some things out.\n\nMeesseman was a huge reason that the Mystics were able to advance past Las Vegas, winning the series on Tuesday night. She had 22 points in the clincher.\n\nThe Mystics and Sun played three times in the regular season and Connecticut won twice. Washington did win the final matchup by an eye-popping 43 points. The two teams haven\u2019t played since June 29.\n\nWhile Washington had to work to put away Las Vegas, Connecticut cruised through the semifinals, sweeping Los Angeles in three games. After getting eliminated in single-elimination playoff games the previous few years, the Sun were determined to get one of the top two seeds and the double-bye that goes with it. After finishing with the second-best record behind Washington in the regular season, Connecticut accomplished that.\n\nThe Sun have benefited by having a healthy year for their starting lineup as the team used the same five to begin every game. The Sun\u2019s starting five of Jasmine Thomas, Alyssa Thomas, Shekinna Stricklen, Courtney Williams and Jonquel Jones all have the ability to have big games, making them tough to game plan against.\n\nThat\u2019s what coach Curt Miller expected when he took over the team in 2016.\n\n\u201cThis was our vision,\u201d Miller said after finishing off the sweep Sunday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A year after getting swept in the WNBA Finals, Elena Delle Donne and the Washington Mystics are back.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Feinberg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/sun_sparks_basketball_35465_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
