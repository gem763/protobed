(NASDAQ:SWKS) Insiders Have Been Selling Shares", "language": "en", "text": "It is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS).\n\nDo Insider Transactions Matter?\n\nMost investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.\n\nWe would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.'\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Skyworks Solutions\n\nThe Non-Employee Director, Timothy Furey, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$184k worth of shares at a price of US$73.51 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$79.87. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 9.3% of Timothy Furey's stake. Timothy Furey was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.\n\nThe chart below shows insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year.
