(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nWatching Washington\u2019s professional sports teams in action lately has been a real treat, for the most part.\n\nThe Nationals are now tied in the National League Division Series after facing elimination. The Capitals were ranked second in their division heading into Tuesday night\u2019s game. D.C. United will enter the upcoming Major League Soccer playoffs as a fifth seed.\n\nAnd the Mystics could be crowned WNBA champions Tuesday night.\n\nThen there are the Redskins, the team with an 0-5 record and a throwback name steeped in stereotype and stained with genocide.\n\nThe Oxford dictionary describes the word \u201credskin\u201d as \u201cdated, offensive.\u201d Surely there are names more worthy of a team that calls the nation\u2019s capital its home.\n\nSo what better time to come up with a new name than now.\n\nThe Washington football team is \u201cstarting over\u201d after firing Coach Jay Gruden, a Post sports headline read Monday, \u201cbut in what direction are they headed?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the eighth coach gone since Dan Snyder bought the team 20 years ago. And, as another Post headline put it, \u201chis successor is already destined to fail.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because Snyder has pretty much tried everything he knows. He\u2019s changed coaches, managers, quarterbacks, PR agents, you name it. Changed everything \u2014 except himself and the name of the team.\n\nWhy not really start over? Acknowledge that times have changed and hold a naming contest. Pick one that doesn\u2019t disparage other human beings. How difficult can that be?\n\nYou want warriors for mascots, we\u2019ve got every branch of the military to draw on right in our own backyard. The Air Force has a fighter plane called a Wart Hog. Perfect. The Navy has SEALs. Either one could beat a Cowboy.\n\nYou want a bird? Philadelphia has what should have been our eagle. But the D.C. region has the next biggest thing: the turkey vulture. Scary ugly, yes, but slogan-friendly: Every opponent is just roadkill for the Washington Vultures.\n\nThe point is the team needs a new name. And almost anything beats the old one.\n\nI know how hard it must be for some to give it up. After the Super Bowl victory against the Miami Dolphins in 1983, I was among a half-million fans celebrating in downtown D.C., whooping it up with Chief Zee, singing that fight song with reckless abandon.\n\nIn a region deeply divided by race and class, the Washington football team was a rare unifier. If only for a few hours each week, the burgundy and gold could make you forget about being black or white. No small accomplishment.\n\nThere had been objections to the team\u2019s name back then. But with Coach Joe Gibbs taking the team to the postseason seven times, winning four NFC championships and three Super Bowls out of four appearances from 1983 to 1992, the protests were easily drowned out by the cheers.\n\nThen, in 1992, an American Indian woman named Suzan Harjo filed a lawsuit against the NFL\u2019s Washington franchise, arguing that the Redskins violated trademark standards against the use of disparaging names and imagery.\n\n[Activist Suzan Shown Harjo is still winning her fight against Native American mascots]\n\nFrom a mountain of legal briefs filed in support of the lawsuit, we learned that Native American schoolchildren were being adversely affected by these degrading sports mascots. Since 1970, more than 4,000 schools have discontinued the use of Native American mascots and changed the names of their sports teams.\n\nIn response to an Annenberg poll in 2004 that said 90 percent of Native Americans \u201care not bothered\u201d by the team name, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and \u201ccolonialism.\u201d\n\nGibbs retired in 1993, his departure lamented as \u201cthe end of an era.\u201d It certainly was the end of the team as we knew it. And because of what Harjo\u2019s lawsuit had revealed, it should have been the end of the name as well.\n\nThe late team owner Jack Kent Cooke insisted that \u201cthe name was never intended to offend anyone.\u201d During negotiations over a stadium location in 1993 with then-D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, Cooke patted her on the behind. No offense intended then, either, in his view.\n\n\u201cHe was hoping we would reach a deal, and this was his insulting way of suggesting job well done,\u201d recalled the former mayor, who publicly criticized Cooke after the incident as a \u201cbully billionaire.\u201d\n\nThat Cooke didn\u2019t intend for the name or the pat on the behind to be offensive was beside the point. Acts of disrespect that might have been overlooked in the past were no longer being overlooked.\n\nSnyder has vowed to keep the name, claiming it is a \u201cterm of honor.\u201d He isn\u2019t being a bully billionaire. Just a clueless one.\n\nThe Washington football team has been in slow decline for nearly three decades. Now it\u2019s losing attendance, losing more games, more talent and the last modicum of respect. There is no escaping the curse of that team\u2019s name. The days of our region being unified by it are over.\n\nChange the name. Or lose the team.\n\nTo read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/milloy.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The football team is changing coaches \u2014 again.
