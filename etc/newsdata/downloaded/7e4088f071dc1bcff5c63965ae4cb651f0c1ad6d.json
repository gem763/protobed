The party believes these two CMs today stand head and shoulders above every other politician in the fray. BJP almost seems to be telling voters: there is no alternative, a replay of the TINA factor that swung 2019 so decisively for Narendra Modi only a few months ago. It would be a thesis that will be tested on October 21 when the two states go to the polls. The outcomes may also decide the BJP strategy in forthcoming elections to Delhi and Jharkhand.\n\nFadnavis has much going for him and the BJP has not shied away from making it a Fadnavis vs Sharad Pawar fight. The age difference between Fadnavis and Pawar is glaring to say the least. \u201cFadnavis the clean\u201d versus \u201cPawar the compromised\u201d was a tack BJP tried but now seems to have gone easy on after Pawar turned the tables crying victimisation. Pawar has also matched Fadnavis in energy touring the state like the latter rallying dispirited NCP and Congress cadres. What may ultimately end up hurting the UPA is the exodus of so many leaders, the paucity of resources and the quiet campaigning by many of its leaders.\n\nCongress despite contesting a lion\u2019s share of seats opened a so called war room only on October 6 with just two weeks for polling. By then Fadnavis was almost winding up his statewide yatra. Even its leaders have been surprisingly muted. One of its promising Maharashtra youth leaders Rajeev Satav was seen in Ahmedabad last week to welcome Rahul Gandhi who was in town to defend himself in a defamation case. Ashok Chavan is focused on regaining lost ground in Nanded and another former CM, Prithviraj Chavan was anyway never a formidable campaigner. The third former Congress CM Sushil Kumar Shinde gave the game away complaining that the two UPA parties were tired and needed to merge forcing an angry rebuttal from Pawar.\n\nIn Haryana, Khattar is being pitted against BS Hooda, with the BJP targeting Hooda\u2019s \u201cdubious\u201d land allotments and Jat slant while lionising Khattar\u2019s bachelorhood, honesty and not patronising any community. The Haryana BJP is a comparatively new force without entrenched factions and projecting Khattar gained momentum with his performance as an administrator improving after a diffident start. Fadnavis, in contrast, has had to work hard against sulking seniors and finally managed to marginalise the entire lot: Eknath Khadse, Vinod Tawde, and Nitin Gadkari-loyalist Chandrashekhar Bawankule.\n\nBut the presidential model has its limitations against anti-incumbency. Late last year, three strong BJP CMs\u2014Raman Singh, Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chouhan\u2014were felled without Congress projecting any CM face against them. But two regional bigwigs K Chandrashekar Rao and Naveen Patnaik sailed through. In Maharashtra and Haryana, BJP is counting on the absence of anti-incumbency while betting on its CM faces. The weak opposition in these two states is also reminiscent of Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh on the eve of the 2008 and 2013 elections which the BJP won comfortably. A week from now\u2014October 24 will indicate whether the insipid election campaign in these two states masked a deceptive message.", "description": "BJP has gone into the Maharashtra and Haryana battle highlighting its respective chief ministers: Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal Khattar.
