They sat in the couches to the left and were trying to remain unseen.\"\n\nBut that didn't stop Jen from sharing her Amazon wishlist with fans, featuring delights such as a marble cheese slicer (natch), an aroma diffuser and a wooden salad bowl.\n\n\"Planning a wedding is so exciting, but it can be overwhelming,\" she wrote on the page.\n\n\"For anyone else needing a little inspiration, I thought it would be fun to collaborate with Amazon to share a few of my favorite registry wish-list items.\n\n'It's so easy, and you can find everything you need all in one place.\"\n\n(Image: Twitter/Elizabeth Lauren)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nShe and Cooke got engaged in February, having met in May 2018 through their mutual friend Laura Simpson.\n\nJ-Law was spotted wearing her low-key engagement ring in New York earlier this year, where she and Adele enjoyed a wild hen do surrounded by drag queens in the East Village.\n\nLightweight Jen even ended up peeing in a bucket rather than risk walking up a flight of steps to the toilet.\n\nAlan Cumming, who runs the Club Cumming venue in the city, revealed what happened when the famous besties rolled in for Jen's secret hen do.\n\n\"We had a hilarious time where Jennifer Lawrence and Adele came,\" the actor told People Now .\n\n\"They went downstairs to the basement and Jennifer got her makeup done by the drag queens.\n\n\"And she peed in a bucket because she didn't want to go all the way back upstairs! Adele was there going, 'she's the face of Chanel!'\" he laughed.", "description": "Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence is marrying her fiance of eight months Cooke Maroney this Saturday in a beautiful autumnal wedding", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Elder Ordonez", "Splashnews.Com", "Pa", "Sourced Instagram", "Twitter Elizabeth Lauren", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13960437.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Jennifer-Lawrence-takes-her-beau-out-for-dinner-tonight-in-New-York-City.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
