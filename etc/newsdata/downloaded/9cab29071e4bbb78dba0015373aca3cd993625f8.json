If you can relate, Bejar would tell you that managing family expectations, like those from your mother or future mother-in-law, all comes down to learning to assert yourself.\n\n\"I think a lot of people getting married need support with being more assertive in many other areas of their lives, but the wedding is first or most significant place where it's coming up,\" Bejar said.\n\nAlthough what \"asserting yourself\" looks like depends on you and your spouse-to-be, it generally involves getting a clear idea about you both want out of the wedding and then reinforcing those wants in a stern but respectful way.\n\nRead more: How to know if someone is a serial cheater or if they've actually made a mistake, according to a therapist\n\nOnce you know your wedding must-haves, whether that's a three-course dinner, an ice cream sundae bar, or a Mariachi band, it's important to take note of the existing relationship you and your partner have with your families.\n\nIf either your parents or your partner's parents are helping to fund the wedding, for example, their opinions may hold a bit more weight in the planning process. But if your father is set on inviting his dozens of distant cousins to your wedding and you'd prefer a smaller affair, you have to let that be known even if it can feel a bit scary at first, Bejar said.\n\nIf you don't see eye-to-eye with a close family member, Bejar recommended having an honest conversation with that person about how their constant suggestions and requests about your big day make you feel.\n\n\"Label feelings and actions, not their intentions, because you don't know their intentions,\" Bejar said. That way, \"it's very clear and comes from a genuine, vulnerable place. Most reasonable people are receptive to that, and if they're not, that says something.\"\n\nEnlist loved ones to help you \"buffer\" expected stressors\n\nYour friends can help you manage wedding-day stress.

Because of this, many brides worry they won't be in the moment during their weddings because they're focused on all of the elements being just so or placating certain guests that they might not want to be around.\n\nIf you can pinpoint these potential situations before the wedding day, you can get a close friend or relative to help you stay in the moment, Bejar said.\n\n\"Sit down and take inventory of 'my people' and who is offering to help you,\" she said. If your bridesmaids or cousins have asked how they can help you out, for example, and you know you can't stand talking to your partner's aunt, assign them the duty of keeping said aunt occupied all night. That way, you can focus on what's important to you while keeping all of your guests happy.\n\n\"Talk with that person beforehand and figure out how they can help and be a buffer for you without fully controlling them,\" Bejar said.", "description": "Learning to act assertive and requesting help when you need it are two strategies that can help manage most scenarios.", "authors": ["Julia Naftulin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9252692e22af4cae76170a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
