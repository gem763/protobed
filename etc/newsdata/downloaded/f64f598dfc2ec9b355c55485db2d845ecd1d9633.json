Glaciers in Austria, on the eastern edge of the Alps, are particularly sensitive to climate change and have been shrinking even more rapidly than most, making it all the more urgent to examine their contents before they disappear, said Andrea Fischer, a scientist conducting the work.\n\nScientists work next to the drilling tent at Gepatschferner glacier at Weissseespitze summit at over 3,500 meters above sea level. \"We are now roughly at 1920. The rest has already been lost - everything from 1920 until now,\" Fischer, of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Mountain Research in Innsbruck, said of her work seeking Austria's oldest ice at the top of the Weissseespitze, a peak more than 3,500 metres high. \"In the next two years we will lose another 70 years (of ice and data),\" she added, describing ice at the top of the glacier.\n\nGlaciologist Andrea Fischer from the Austrian Institute for Interdisciplinary Mountain Research, examines an ice core of Gepatschferner glacier at Weissseespitze summit. At the top of this mountain, Fischer and her colleagues have drilled to the bottom of the comparatively undisturbed glacier to extract samples of its ice, which is being analysed for information on the local climate thousands of years ago. Fischer, whose work has contributed to the IPCC report, believes the ice could be 3,000 to 5,000 years old. Her samples are going through lab testing to date them.\n\nAn ice core of Gepatschferner glacier waits to be numbered and wrapped at Weissseespitze summit at over 3,500 meters above sea level. The lower layers are more densely packed than those at the top, meaning that one metre of ice could include thousands of years of data. \"The ice is only a few meters thick. In a few years, this summit will be completely ice-free,\" she said.\n\nEnvironmental physicist Pascal Bohleber from the Austrian Institute for Interdisciplinary Mountain Research, uses a chainsaw to cut out a sample of ice inside an artificial ice tunnel of Schaufelferner glacier at Stubaier glacier ski resort. While analysis of other materials, such as tree trunks, can provide information on the air temperature in summer, glaciers' ice is a rare source of information on precipitation, she said. And much of it will soon be lost.\n\nVideo\n\nStory The challenge is to take current data on how the climate is changing and compare it with the information we have on the climate in previous centuries and millennia. \"The question is, how exceptional is this process? That is what we are determining with this drilling of the ice.\"", "description": "Scientists are racing to read a rapidly melting archive of climate data going back thousands of years - the inside of Austria's Alpine glaciers.", "authors": ["Lisi Niesner"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQyoFnUhVterCdb1P0iqg589fQ9hzhDw0fJWPZ9Mtg74Tzv4apKinB773gc8aV0CTn-2WLylMojO9IpXj8bf1_rTFfTBNbgTNQoGpF6IObt1o"}
