Sure, you\u2019ve got Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Gear.Club but neither of them could be classed as a sim racer. Luckily, Codemasters and Feral Interactive have answered my prayers.\n\nGRID Autosport was originally a last gen release, an apology letter to GRID fans after its woeful sequel. Autosport was developed in 14 months and was a game I really wanted to play. But releasing on last gen consoles in 2014, and never having been ported to the current gen, meant I missed out. So news of a digital release on the Switch had me very excited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring my time with GRID Autosport, I\u2019ve found myself 10 seasons into the career mode. Rather than starting in a slow car and making you work your way up, all five disciplines are open from the start and you can switch back and forth as much or as little as you choose. It\u2019s a refreshing change to not have to be forced to take part in disciplines I don\u2019t want to, and this open approach was adopted by both Project CARS and is returning in the GRID reboot just around the corner.\n\nFrom the five disciplines on offer, you can choose from Touring, Open Wheel, Endurance, Tuner, and Street. There\u2019s no lack of variety and it shows after choosing one, as you\u2019ll be offered two teams to race for with different team objectives. This happens with any discipline you choose, but sadly the objectives are nothing more than an XP award. But obviously GRID Autosport would be nothing if it didn\u2019t play any good.\n\nAs with every Codemasters game, it plays fantastically. They\u2019ve always been masters at making racing games feel very realistic but also easy to pick and play and this is no exception. Every car I\u2019ve used has had its own feel, for instance an American muscle car can feel slow to accelerate, whilst a McLaren P1 is a beast that needs taming due to its high speed and sensitive steering.\n\nHD Rumble does a great job further improving the feel of each car, with bumps in the road and collisions vibrating realistically. It can have a steep learning curve, but there\u2019s a mountain of assists to help a racing noob to be able to play well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGraphically, Feral Interactive have to be praised for their work on this Switch port. In \u2018Graphics\u2019 mode It runs at 1080p 30fps in docked mode and has kept that performance consistently for the past 10 hours of play time. You\u2019ll see beautifully realised cars, amazing reflections, and lovely filtered rays of sunshine on the track. It stands up brilliantly and is a visual treat to behold and easily one of the best-looking games on the Switch.\n\nBut if you\u2019re not liking the locked 30fps and want 60fps with graphical elements knocked down, \u2018Performance\u2019 mode has you covered. I didn\u2019t use it much but it\u2019s nice to see a developer go the extra mile, especially when it was in development for well over a year.\n\nConsidering there are five different racing disciplines to play, brilliant graphics and handling on offer, how much content is there? Packed with all the DLC, Autosport contains more than 100 cars and 27 tracks, from Brands Hatch to the streets of Chicago. And with all the variations of each track, there\u2019s well over 100 to master.\n\nThe career mode is chock full of content with the GRID World Series to reach by getting enough XP through races. There\u2019s quick race and time trial options to muck around with and a side of drag racing and demolition derby. And as promised by Feral Interactive, a free multiplayer update will be added to keep you playing for at least 20+ hours. It\u2019s fair to say it totally justifies it\u2019s \u00a330 price tag, just on content alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith GRID Autosport now on the Switch, there is now no better racing game on the system. It plays and looks outstanding in both docked and handheld modes, and with at least 20 hours of content across five racing disciplines in the career mode, there\u2019s now no arguing about its price tag.\n\nIf you\u2019re a racing junkie who was hoping for a serious racer or a casual guy looking for some quick races, there\u2019s now a new king in town. An essential purchase.\n\nBy reader Charlie Ridgewell\n\nThe reader\u2019s feature does not necessary represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.
