(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nAs the Democratic presidential contenders begin a four-month sprint to the Iowa caucuses, the front-runner, Joe Biden, is in trouble. Biden surged to the lead even before he announced, buoyed by name recognition, experience and his service as vice president to Barack Obama. He was anointed the \u201cmost electable\u201d of Democrats. But, now, his early lead in polls is fading, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) even inching ahead of him in a recent Iowa poll. This marks only the beginning of Biden\u2019s fall: In reality, as findings from a new book by veteran Democratic pollster and strategist Stanley Greenberg suggest, among the lead contenders Biden might well be the weakest potential opponent to President Trump.\n\nIt is not his age but his history that bedevils Biden, and not style but substance that weighs on his candidacy. Biden got the big things wrong repeatedly over the last 40 years. In what he has since called a \u201cbig mistake,\u201d he championed the infamous 1994 crime bill that contributed to the unconscionable mass incarceration that particularly ravaged the African American community. As Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, he left Anita Hill to fend for herself during the Clarence Thomas hearings. He defended President Bill Clinton\u2019s repeal of Aid to Mothers of Dependent Children. He consistently backed pro-corporate trade treaties \u2014 from the North American Free Trade Agreement to letting China into the World Trade Organization \u2014 that savaged America\u2019s manufacturing workers. He voted for the invasion of Iraq, surely the greatest foreign policy debacle since Vietnam. (He now claims he was duped by then-President George W. Bush.) And he was all in for Wall Street deregulation that helped lead to the worst recession since the Great Depression, then served in the administration that bailed out the banks, put no major banker in jail for what the FBI called an epidemic of fraud and left homeowners adrift.\n\nBiden\u2019s basic pitch is as the candidate of restoration. He paints Trump as an aberration and promises a return to normalcy. He boasts about the recovery under Obama and chafes at the populist rhetoric against bankers and corporate CEOs. But as Greenberg details in his new book \u201cRIP GOP: How the New America Is Dooming the Republicans,\u201d this isn\u2019t where most voters are \u2014 and it certainly isn\u2019t where the core constituents of the Democratic majority coalition are.\n\nGreenberg, who made his name as Clinton\u2019s pollster in 1992, offers a bracing tonic for citizens about Trump\u2019s poisonous politics. As the 2018 election demonstrated, Trump\u2019s strategy rouses his base; Greenberg notes he has the unbending support of 40 percent of voters. But that same strategy mobilizes his opposition as well. The Democratic base \u2014 particularly what Greenberg describes as the rising U.S. electorate \u2014 millennials, women (particularly single women), people of color \u2014 are appalled by and ardently and increasingly opposed to Trump.\n\nThey were central to the record turnout in the off-year elections in 2018, and Greenberg\u2019s polling shows them even more engaged headed into 2020. Moreover, a quarter of the Republican Party base is more moderate than the extreme tea party screeds that Trump echoes. In his book, Greenberg reports that in 2018, among moderate Republicans \u2014 one-fourth of the Republican Party \u2014 \u201cjust 69 percent voted Republican, 12 percent defected to the Democrats, and 19 percent stayed home.\u201d\n\nThe new majority in the United States, he argues, embraces diversity, sees immigrants as strengthening the country, rejects the social reaction that Trump Republicans trumpet and demands expansive government addressing real challenges that Trump Republicans deny, such as climate change.\n\nThe likely result in the upcoming election, Greenberg predicts, is a \u201csecond blue wave on at least the scale of the first in 2018 and finally will crash and shatter the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nGreenberg indicts Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201ccampaign malpractice\u201d for her loss in 2016. She didn\u2019t want to criticize the Obama recovery and seemed oblivious to the damage done to working people by the financial wilding and the purblind trade policies. She joined Obama in praising a recovery that most Americans were not experiencing. If Clinton had only put a populist focus on the economy in the waning days of the election, Greenberg argues, she would have won. Then again, in an age when voters are understandably cynical about politicians \u2014 and when Trump routinely scorns their corruption \u2014 credibility matters. Given her history \u2014 her husband\u2019s embrace of corporate trade and financial deregulation, her coziness to Wall Street \u2014 Clinton would have a hard time credibly presenting herself as a populist tribune.\n\nUnique among leading Democratic contenders, Biden suffers the same problems. His record \u2014 which Trump will surely bring up \u2014 gets in the way of his rhetoric. And like Clinton, he is unlikely to admit Obama\u2019s flaws for those voters who don\u2019t just want to return to the past.\n\nFor months, pundits have been warning about the Democratic candidates going too far to the left \u2014 embracing bolder reforms and a bolder, more aggressive agenda. Greenberg\u2019s book is a necessary corrective, demonstrating that Trump\u2019s own tea party extremism is forging a powerful majority coalition intent of ousting him from office and removing those standing in the way of addressing the challenges this country faces. Greenberg implies virtually any of the leading Democratic contenders can beat Trump and beat him badly. Ironically, the weakest of these might well be Biden, burdened with defending a series of votes and positions that have not worked for most Americans. Democrats win big if they nominate a candidate credible as an agent of change, willing to take an economy rigged by the few. Biden is about to discover that once they take a good look, Democrats will find it hard to see him in that role.\n\nRead more:\n\nKatrina vanden Heuvel: Democrats, don\u2019t be afraid to go big in 2020\n\nE.J.
