It was widely condemned by critics, as it depicted a country sharply at odds with the America portrayed by Hollywood and the ad men.\n\nEarl A Powell III, art historian and museum director, said the work showed \"a people plagued by racism, often ill-served by their politicians, intoxicated with the media and celebrities, and infatuated with speed, movement, and even the road itself\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFrank shot on a small 35mm camera without a motor, so unlike today where you'd find near identical frames sides by side, his contact sheets reveal how he has moved through the crowd, seizing moments of interest.\n\nUltimately, The Americans is a book that flows from front to back, a visual poem where sequencing was all important.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Contact sheets from The Americans\n\nImage copyright Robert Frank courtesy Pace/MacGill Image caption Parade - Hoboken, New Jersey, 1955, from The Americans\n\nImage copyright Robert Frank courtesy Pace/MacGill Image caption Trolley - New Orleans, 1955, from The Americans\n\nImage copyright Robert Frank, courtesy Pace/MacGill Image caption Charleston, South Carolina, 1955, from The Americans\n\nImage copyright Robert Frank, courtesy Pace/MacGill Image caption View from hotel window - Butte, Montana, 1956, from The Americans\n\nFrank's loose style broke the mould. He shot around 28,000 images that were edited down to 83 for a book that rewrote the rules of photo-journalism.\n\nBeat poet Jack Kerouac wrote in the preface to the book's US edition, Frank \"sucked a sad poem right out of America on to film.\"\n\nFrank went on to make a number of films, including a documentary about the Rolling Stones 1972 tour of America which the group banned from being shown as it captured moments of drug taking.\n\nImage copyright Robert Frank, courtesy Pace/MacGill Image caption Wales, Ben James, 1953\n\nImage copyright Robert Frank, courtesy Pace/MacGill Image caption New York City, 7 Bleecker Street, September, 1993\n\n\"He never crossed over into celebrity,\" said photographer Nan Goldin. \"He's famous because he made a mark. He collected the world.\"\n\nBoth of his children have passed away, his daughter was killed in a plane crash aged just 20 and his son Pablo took his own life in 1994.\n\nBut Frank will be remembered as one of the greatest photographers of the 20th century and beyond.\n\nImage copyright Fred Stein Archive/Archive Photos/Getty Images Image caption Robert Frank holding a pre-war Leica camera, 1954\n\nAll images subject to copyright.", "description": "One of the most influential photographers of the 20th Century has died.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DE97/production/_108738965_gettyimages-507818094.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
