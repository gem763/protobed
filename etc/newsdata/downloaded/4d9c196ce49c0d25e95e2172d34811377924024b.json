The biggest damage would be to the British themselves,\u201d Scholz told the Funke media group.\n\n\u201cBut we should be under no illusion - it would affect Germany too. New tariffs and additional tariff controls could lead to delays in trade,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, however, that German customs authorities were well-prepared for such an eventuality.\n\nIn 2018, German exports to Britain accounted for roughly 6% of overall foreign sales, making the United Kingdom the fifth-most important export destination for German goods makers.\n\nGermany\u2019s export-dependent manufacturers are already suffering from uncertainty over Brexit, a global economic slowdown and rising trade tensions, and most economists expect Europe\u2019s biggest economy to dip into recession.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel said earlier that a divorce deal could still be reached between Britain and the EU.", "description": "Germans face trade bottlenecks if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal due to the effect of new tariffs and extra customs checks, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz warned on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431402871&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H23O", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
