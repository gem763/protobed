USA TODAY\n\nAnd then there was one.\n\nClemson was left standing as the lone Atlantic Coast Conference team to be ranked in the polls after Wake Forest and Virginia suffered defeats over the weekend at the hands of Louisville and Miami, respectively.\n\nClemson appears to be in command of the Atlantic Division for a fifth consecutive year, but the Coastal Division crown looks to be available to all again. North Carolina, Duke and Virginia share the top spot, but save for Georgia Tech just about any of the six other teams in the Coastal could wind up in Charlotte for the ACC Championship Game on Dec. 7.\n\n1. Clemson (6-0, 4-0 )\n\nLast week: No. 1\n\nThe gap between Clemson and Florida State remains large, as the Tigers proved again Saturday in a 45-14 demolition of the Seminoles that could\u2019ve been worse. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence had one of his most impressive games to date, accounting for four first-half touchdowns before essentially taking the second half off. Clemson, which is riding a 21-game winning streak, clearly is the class of the ACC and will get to show that again this week with a road game at upstart Louisville, a team the Tigers drilled 77-16 last season.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Louisville, noon ET, ABC.\n\n2. North Carolina (3-3, 2-1)\n\nLast week: No. 4\n\nIs this the same North Carolina that went 2-9 last season? No, it\u2019s not. The Tar Heels are .500, but their three defeats have come against a 5-1 Wake Forest team, league kingpin Clemson (by one point) and an Appalachian State team (by three points) that cracked the Top 25 this week. If North Carolina can win at Virginia Tech this week, it will return home to host their top division contenders \u2013 Duke and Virginia \u2013 the next two weeks, with a chance to get a firm grip on the Coastal.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Virginia Tech, 3:30 p.m., Raycom.\n\n3. Pittsburgh (4-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week: No. 6\n\nThe Panthers haven\u2019t been overwhelmingly impressive, but it\u2019s hard to ignore their upset of Central Florida and near-upset at Penn State. Pittsburgh also may have the least-treacherous path to the Coastal title IF the Panthers can win at Syracuse this week. After that they get Miami (Fla.), North Carolina and Boston College at home and have winnable road games at Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech.\n\nUp next: Friday at Syracuse, 7 p.m., ESPN.\n\n4. Virginia (4-2, 2-1)\n\nLast week: No. 3\n\nThe preseason Coastal Division favorite lost its way last week in Miami as well as its offense, managing only 318 yards and three field goals in a loss to the Hurricanes. The Cavaliers\u2019 hopes of becoming the seventh different Coastal champ in as many years took a hit, but are far from over given the unpredictable nature of their division brethren.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Duke, 3:30 p.m., ACC Network.\n\n5. Wake Forest (5-1, 1-1)\n\nLast week: No. 2\n\nA potential Atlantic Division showdown at Clemson on Nov. 16 may be a pipe dream after the Demon Deacons were knocked from the ranks of the unbeaten by upstart Louisville in a 62-59 shootout last week. Wake Forest\u2019s offense is potent, but the Deacons\u2019 defense is lacking, which could be problematic what with an angry Florida State team rolling into town next.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Florida State, 7:30 p.m., ACC Network.\n\nWake Forest tight end Jack Freudenthal (86) checks for a touchdown signal during the fourth quarter against Louisville at BB&T Field.

Florida State (3-3, 2-2)\n\nLast week: No. 5\n\nThe Seminoles took it on the chin last week at Clemson, but that doesn\u2019t mean Florida State isn\u2019t the second-best team in the Atlantic Division. Saturday\u2019s game at Wake Forest will go a long way toward determining that. Florida State running back Cam Akers could have a big day against a Wake Forest defense that is suspect at best.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Wake Forest, 7:30 p.m., ACC Network.\n\n7. North Carolina State (4-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week: No. 10\n\nNorth Carolina State continues to search for consistent production on offense, but the Wolfpack defense continues to step up, with its latest performance paving the way to a 16-9 victory against Syracuse. North Carolina State\u2019s only touchdown came on a trick play, which may be the Pack\u2019s best strategy going forward.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Boston College, noon, Raycom\n\n8. Duke (4-2, 2-1)\n\nLast week: No. 8\n\nThe Blue Devils are coming off a 41-23 victory at Georgia Tech in which they scored 38 consecutive points. Duke needs to savor the victory because the sledding gets tougher from here, beginning with this week\u2019s trip to Virginia. The Cavaliers have won four straight against the Blue Devils, who then travel to North Carolina before hosting Notre Dame.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Virginia, 3:30 p.m., ACC Network.\n\n9. Louisville (4-2, 2-1)\n\nLast week: No. 11\n\nEveryone seems to be getting in on the act for Louisville, which is coming off a wild 62-59 victory that stunned Wake Forest. Although this week\u2019s visit from Clemson could bring the Cardinals back down to earth with a heavy dose of reality, there\u2019s no question that Louisville\u2019s rebuilding project is well ahead of schedule.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. No. 1 Clemson, noon, ABC.\n\n10. Miami (Fla.) (3-3, 1-2)\n\nLast week: No. 13\n\nJust when the Hurricanes appear to be down and out, they pull a rabbit out of a hat. Miami took down Virginia 17-9 last week despite gaining only 265 yards, but suddenly quarterback N\u2019Kosi Perry looks like a potential hero again. Victory No. 4 should be a given what with Georgia Tech rolling into town this week; the Yellow Jackets haven\u2019t won at Miami since 2007.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Georgia Tech, noon, ACC Network.\n\n11. Virginia Tech (4-2, 1-2)\n\nLast week: No. 9\n\nIt looks like the Hokies have found their quarterback of the future in sophomore Hendon Hooker. Hooker, who made his second career start Saturday against Rhode Island, completed 16 of 27 passes for 261 yards with three touchdowns in a 34-17 victory.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. North Carolina, 3:30 p.m., Raycom\n\n12. Syracuse (3-3, 0-2)\n\nLast week: No. 7\n\nThe Syracuse offense was nowhere to be found in a loss at N.C. State last week. Orange quarterback Tommy DeVito was sacked eight times, and Syracuse managed only 41 yards rushing on 37 carries. Hopes of another 10-3 season and New Year\u2019s Day bowl berth are fading fast.\n\nUp next: Friday vs. Pittsburgh, 7 p.m., ESPN\n\n13. Boston College (3-3, 1-2)\n\nLast week: No. 12\n\nBoston College is coming off a bye week, which could serve the Eagles well against North Carolina State. Each of the past three games between the teams has been decided by a touchdown or less, so expect yet another close affair. Standout running back A.J. Dillon missed last year\u2019s game against North Carolina State, but had 196 yards against the Wolfpack in 2017.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. North Carolina State, noon, Raycom.\n\n14. Georgia Tech (1-5, 0-3)\n\nLast week: No. 14\n\nThe Yellow Jackets marched easily downfield and scored a touchdown on their first possession last week against Duke. Then things went downhill as the Blue Devils scored 38 consecutive points and sent Georgia Tech to its fifth loss.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Miami (Fla.), noon, ACC Network.", "description": "Clemson is lone Atlantic Coast Conference team in polls after Wake Forest, Virginia fall from ranks of unbeaten in conference play.", "authors": ["Scott Keepfer", "Published P.M.
