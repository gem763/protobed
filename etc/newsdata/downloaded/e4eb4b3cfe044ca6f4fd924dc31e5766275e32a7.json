Rizzo rolled his right ankle attempting to field a bunt from pitcher Trevor Williams while also trying to avoid colliding with teammate Jos\u00e9 Quintana.\n\nRizzo drew two walks and scored a run before Ian Happ replaced him at first base.\n\nThe Cubs announced that Rizzo has a sprained right ankle. X-rays showed no fracture, which is good news. Rizzo will undergo an MRI on Monday to determine the severity of the injury.\n\nThe 30-year-old Rizzo is batting .289/.404/.516 with 26 home runs, 93 RBI, and 88 runs scored in 592 plate appearances this season. The Cubs entered Sunday\u2019s action leading the second NL Wild Card by one game over the Brewers. Losing Rizzo for any amount of time would severely impact the Wild Card race for all involved.", "description": "Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo sprained his ankle attempting to field a bunt and had to be helped off the field.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bASySTf3orsWssHTWCCeTA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oYIo1sQheOjV2YZVpLQB9A--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/f0317dd892086032745a6882125dc50d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
