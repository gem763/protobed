The authorities said they were investigating the killing and two people had been arrested.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that it is intimidation against opposition members. They want to prevent me from creating an opposition party,\u201d Ingabire told Reuters on Tuesday as she was arriving at a hearing in the case of nine other people from her party who face terrorism-related charges.\n\n\u201cThis killing has no other implications other than intimidating Rwandans from participating in politics of their country,\u201d Ingabire said. \u201cIt is time to ask security services to do something about those killings and protect the opposition members as all Rwandans.\u201d\n\nIngabire, who was jailed in 2010 after declaring herself a candidate to challenge President Paul Kagame in an election, is seeking to have her party recognized by the authorities.\n\nDusabumuremyi was at least the second aide to Ingabire to be killed this year; her spokesman was found dead in March. At least two other aides have gone missing this year in unexplained circumstances.\n\nRights group Amnesty International said in a statement: \u201cIt is essential that the Government of Rwanda protects the rights to freedom of expression and association, including for opposition politicians, and ends the current climate of harassment and intimidation they face.\u201d\n\nIngabire returned to Rwanda to launch an opposition political movement in 2010 after 16 years exile in the Netherlands. She was jailed before she could contest the election and served six years of a 15-year sentence on terrorism charges, which she says were politically motivated to block any challenge to Kagame.\n\nA spokesman for Rwanda\u2019s investigation bureau declined to comment when asked if Dusabumuremyi\u2019s killing appeared to be politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThat one you can ask politicians. For us we do investigations and we are investigating,\u201d spokesman Modeste Mbabazi said.\n\nThe bureau said on Twitter: \u201cDuring preliminary investigations, two people suspected of that murder were arrested. The investigation continues to identify the killers and their motive.\u201d\n\nKagame, a member of Rwanda\u2019s Tutsi ethnic majority, led rebels who overthrew a majority Hutu-led government responsible for a genocide that killed an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994.\n\nHe has won praise abroad for presiding over a largely peaceful and rapid economic recovery. But rights groups accuse him of widespread abuses including muzzling of independent media and suppression of political opposition, which he denies.", "description": "A senior official in an opposition political party in Rwanda was stabbed to death, in what the party's leader described on Tuesday as an attempt to intimidate opponents of the government and prevent her party from winning official recognition.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
