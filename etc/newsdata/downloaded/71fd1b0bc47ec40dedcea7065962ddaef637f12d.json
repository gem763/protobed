That Could Hurt the Economy, Not Help It.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nCould low interest rates hurt rather than help the economy?\n\nAs the Federal Reserve prepares to lower its key federal-funds rate target by another one-quarter percentage point Wednesday, it\u2019s worth asking whether ultralow interest rates actually do more to hinder the central bank\u2019s goal of promoting growth.\n\nThat\u2019s the question provocatively posed by three academics in an essay on Project Syndicate. To cut to the chase, Ernest Liu and Atif Mian of Princeton University, and Amir Sufi of the University of Chicago, argue that the abundance of cheap capital encourages economic concentration, which stymies growth.\n\nTextbook theory tells us lower interest rates ought to encourage firms to make productivity-enhancing capital investments in technology, the trio write. That should spur the economy\u2019s expansion. Lower financing costs reduce the hurdle rates for capital investments. Lower rates also increase the present value of future revenues from those investments. All stuff from introductory courses in finance.\n\nIn the real world, however, this effect is stronger for industry leaders than the also-rans, they continue. Leaders respond more strongly to a decline in interest rates, in part because they have access to the lowest-cost capital. As a result, the rest of the field is discouraged, and they curb their investments, lowering productivity.\n\nThe result, the authors conclude, is greater concentration at the top. Industries become more concentrated and give rise to \u201clazy monopolists.\u201d Since the early 1980s, when interest rates started their decline from historic heights, there has been \u201cgrowing market concentration, rising corporate profits, weaker business dynamism, and declining productivity growth,\u201d Liu, Mian, and Sufi write. These tendencies become stronger when rates are low, they add.\n\nFor investors, a portfolio emphasizing market leaders and avoiding laggards generates positive returns as interest rates decline, they continue. But for the economy overall, ultralow rates\u2019 effect of increasing market concentration, and thus hurting productivity, may cause more pain than benefits, they conclude.\n\nMore than \u201clazy monopolists,\u201d Scott Galloway\u2014of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, and a serial entrepreneur\u2014contends tech giants have become the \u201cDeath Stars\u201d of the economy, he writes on his No Mercy/No Malice blog. They use their economic power, which includes access to cheap and near-free capital, to quash competition.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) has taken aim at Slack Technologies (WORK) and its messaging service (used to connect us here at Barrons.com). Slack is off 33% since its initial public offering, in part because of a rich valuation (49 times revenue), Galloway writes. But with Mr. Softee undercutting Slack\u2019s \u201cgreat product,\u201d the latter may \u201cshed another 20-50% of its value in the next six months as the Seattle Death Star comes into clearer view.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Apple (AAPL) is taking on content providers, such as music streamer Spotify Technology (SPOT), \u201cwhich has been rendered sterile and now needs to find other business models\u2014original content, podcasts, or controlled distribution on its own device.\u201d There is a tiny alternative you probably haven\u2019t heard of called the Mighty\u2014as if that will be able to make a dent in the iPhone, where my kids stream Apple Music.\n\nApple also has tons of money to drop on other services, such as its new Apple TV+, on which Cupertino says it will spend $6 billion for more content, Galloway points out.\n\n\u201cSo, a tech hardware firm is devoting the same capital to shows with Reese Witherspoon and Jason Momoa as the state of California allocates to the 23 campuses that make up the California State University system,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf it sounds as if we\u2019re living in a dystopia, trust your instincts.\u201d\n\nAs a reminder that the allocation of resources isn\u2019t independent of capital-market conditions, Apple took advantage of the recent borrower\u2019s paradise. Apple was among the blue-chip behemoths that were able to issue long-term bonds with yields under 3% before the recent backup in the bond market.\n\nWhat has that cheap capital wrought? The benefits have been spread unevenly, helping those with the greatest access to inexpensive money, rather than those who can put it to the best use. But the beneficiaries can\u2019t be faulted for taking advantage of the distortions resulting from policies they didn\u2019t make.\n\nWrite to Randall W.
