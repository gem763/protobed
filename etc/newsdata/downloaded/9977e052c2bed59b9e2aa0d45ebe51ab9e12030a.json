As she climbed back up the stairs to her caravan, she tragically fell backwards and hit her head. She went into a coma straight away.\n\nAngie and Malcolm had been travelling around north west France for two weeks before the tragedy cut their holiday short a week earlier than planned.\n\nA healthcare assistant, Angie had helped to deliver hundreds of babies at Lister hospital , and had two dogs that were described as \"her life\".\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\nAngie's three children were told she had a severe bleed on her brain, and they rushed to be at her side. All three caught the 4am ferry to Angers the next morning, on September 28.\n\nBut three days later, Angie sadly died.\n\nRoss Jones, 25, her youngest child, told the Hertfordshire Mercury it was \"horrific seeing her there just lifeless\".\n\nThe digital marketer said: \"You could scream 'I love you' and she wouldn't say it back. You could hug her and she couldn't give it back.\n\n\"She loved to give affection, but she couldn't give it back. It was horrible\".\n\nRoss said he sped to his mum's bedside with his sister Kayleigh Clayton, 31, and brother Carl Jones, 29.\n\nHe said: \"The doctor came in, sat us down and asked what we knew, before he told us what to expect.\n\n\"We were told to talk to her as much as possible. We tried to play music that she loved, talked about the good times and told jokes.\"\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\nThe doctors said there were three possible outcomes: she would start moving, suggesting recovery was possible, she would stay the same, or she would begin to get worse.\n\nBut Ross said: \"Each day, you could see that she was getting a little bit worse. You could see she was fading away.\"\n\nDespite the best efforts of doctors, Angie was found to have become brain dead on September 30. The family, who had been joined by Angie's brothers Steven and Allan, were told the bleeding on the brain was so deep and extensive there was nothing more that doctors could do for her.\n\nThe family said their goodbyes to Angie before she was taken off life support.\n\nRoss said he talked to her about the good times they shared and how she would miss her grandchildren growing up.\n\n\"She would never see me get married and have children myself,\" he said.\n\n\"She always wanted her boys to have children, but she would never see it.\"\n\n\"I said 'I love you to the sky and further', because that is what she would always say to us. That was the last thing I ever said to her, our last goodbye.\"\n\nNow her children are trying to raise money to bring her body back to Stevenage to be cremated, in accordance with her wishes.\n\nLast week, the three siblings set up a fundraiser to help bring Angie's body back to the UK. It has just passed its \u00a34,000 target.", "description": "Mum-of-three Angie Dowsett from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, died after a fall in Angers where she was holidaying with her husband", "authors": ["Joe Davies", "Image", "Swns.Com", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565926.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_JS194880682.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
