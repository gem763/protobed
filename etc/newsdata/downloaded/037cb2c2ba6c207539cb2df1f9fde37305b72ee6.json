The main reason that you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell this is because it is absolutely not the case, although that certainly doesn\u2019t stop a whole bunch of unhinged people from believing it.\n\nHonestly, there is far too much bullshit here to unpack comprehensively but, in brief, the QAnon conspiracy contends that the worlds of both politics and Hollywood are rife with Satanists who are trafficking children for a pedophilic sex ring, and also to harvest from them a drug that gives the ultimate high and also makes you immortal. It is a lot. You might have seen it pop up in the news recently, after The Guardian Australia reported that the husband of one of prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s staffers is a prominent Australian voice in the world of QAnon.\n\nThis conspiracy involves a lot of public figures, according to its adherents. While the inclusion Jeffrey Epstein, who was actually actually involved in the trafficking of minors, almost makes sense even in the absurd context of QAnon, there are others whose inclusion is based on nothing but sheer insanity and the willful misinterpretation of just about anything.\n\nArtist Marina Abramovi\u0107 is at the centre of the conspiracy thanks largely to one piece of performance art she did back in 1996, and Chrissy Teigen got dragged into it because she posted a pizza emoji one time. Almost two full years later, Teigen is still dealing with some of the most deranged people on Twitter, a website famous for its broad varieties of deranged people.\n\nShe has, apparently, had enough:\n\nGet help, pigshit. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 22, 2019\n\nAccording to Teigen, the conspiracy theorists have had a measurable and very negative impact on her life:\n\nif I take legal action, it gets worse because then, to them, it's true and I'm trying to \"silence\" them. It's on posts about anything. Random 90 days fan pages, meme accounts, anything. Even if the content is normal, the comments are\u2026.this shit. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 22, 2019\n\nit's not just weirdos in random towns. these people are all over. I hate what some people have become and what social has done for this kind of reach. it sucks. and now they'll post this too, and it'll get even worse. I'm just so fucking tired. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 22, 2019\n\nI have a love justice yes \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 22, 2019\n\nanyhow that is my morning rant. fuck you, fucking miserable Q shitfucks, you absolute fucking losers \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 22, 2019\n\nAnd not just on the internet:\n\nhonestly you guys are so normal and rational that I know it's hard to really understand it. it's easy to say \"just block and report\" \u2013 I literally have to have pics of some of these people in my garage because they live nearby \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 22, 2019\n\nBoth ignoring it and not ignoring it seem to have had the same effect:\n\nNot tweeting about it because I\u2019m terrified and avoiding it. Tweeting about it because I\u2019m so nervous. You guys have an answer for everything. Dumbfuck detectives, activate! https://t.co/vGYCIHCUT4 \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 23, 2019\n\nPretty fucked up!\n\nIf you would like to know more about just how fucking crazy QAnon is, I would thoroughly recommend this primer from QAnon Anonymous, a podcast dedicated to digging into the depraved depths of the people who believe this shit.", "description": "Chriss Teigen has taken to Twitter to reiterate that she is not in a secret ring of satanic pedophiles and also that QAnon is bullshit.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1058974268.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
