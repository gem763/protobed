Mandatory Credit: Jon Durr-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDay, 27, had been in a coma for four days following his defeat and, despite having emergency brain surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, doctors were unable to save the junior middleweight.\n\n\u201cPatrick Day passed away today, October 16, 2019, succumbing to the traumatic brain injury he suffered in his fight this past Saturday, October 12, at the Wintrust Arena in Chicago, IL,\u201d his promoter Lou DiBella said in a statement\n\n\u201cHe was surrounded by his family, close friends and members of his boxing team, including his mentor, friend and trainer Joe Higgins.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn behalf of Patrick\u2019s family, team, and those closest to him, we are grateful for the prayers, expressions of support and outpouring of love for Pat that have been so obvious since his injury.\u201d\n\nDay was rushed to the hospital on a stretcher after Conwell landed a flurry of punches that left him motionless on the canvas.\n\nBefore turning professional, Day was a highly decorated amateur who won two nationals titles.\n\nHe turned pro in 2013 and became a world-rated super welterweight contender, capturing the WBC Continental Americas championship in 2017 and the IBF Intercontinental championship in 2019. In June he was rated in the top-10 by both the WBC and IBF.\n\nDay\u2019s death comes after 23-year-old Argentine super lightweight Hugo Santillan died in July from injuries suffered in the ring and 28-year-old Russian Maxim Dadashev passed away two day earlier from brain injuries during his fight.\n\n\u201cIt becomes very difficult to explain away or justify the dangers of boxing at a time like this,\u201d DiBella said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a time where edicts or pronouncements are appropriate, or the answers are readily available. It is, however, a time for a call to action.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have the answers, we certainly know many of the questions, have the means to answer them, and have the opportunity to respond responsibly and accordingly and make boxing safer for all who participate.\n\n\u201cThis is a way we can honor the legacy of Pat Day. Many people live much longer than Patrick\u2019s 27 years, wondering if they made a difference or positively affected their world. This was not the case for Patrick Day when he left us.\n\n\u201cRest in peace and power, Pat, with the angels.\u201d", "description": "American boxer Patrick Day died on Wednesday in Chicago as a result of the traumatic brain injury he suffered during his fight on Saturday, where he was knocked out by Charles Conwell in the 10th round.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441663322&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F23E", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
