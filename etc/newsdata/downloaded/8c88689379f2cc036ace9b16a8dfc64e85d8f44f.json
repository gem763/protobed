The committee also called for a special border force for invasive species to be set up by 2020.\n\nChair of the Environmental Audit Committee Mary Creagh MP said: \u201cINNS is one of the UK\u2019s top five threats to the natural environment. If we\u2019re to beat this, we need people power with an army of volunteers trained to spot and stop an invasive species before it becomes established.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing changes, from climate change, that put the future of our natural landscape at risk. Oak Processionary Moth caterpillars can strip an oak tree bare as well as posing a hazard to our own health. We face losing half of the UK\u2019s native ash trees to ash dieback within a century costing \u00a315 billion. New regulations to halt their progress are welcome but they are too little, too late.", "description": "Britain needs a 'citizen's army' to fight the influx of invasive species, a committee of MPs has advised the government in a new report.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Fraser Nelson", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000053741910-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
