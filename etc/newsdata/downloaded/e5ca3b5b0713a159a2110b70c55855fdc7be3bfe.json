They raided three properties in County Armagh on Wednesday night, all understood to be connected to Robinson.\n\nPolice are still trying to piece together how the victims got into the container and where the container originated.\n\nAccording to the latest update from the police, the container was transported by ferry from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on Tuesday night, arriving just after midnight on Wednesday at the port of Purfleet in the U.K.\n\n\n\nRobinson, who had traveled from Ireland to the U.K., picked up the container just after 1 a.m. Ambulance staff discovered the bodies at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays just before 1:40 a.m. and alerted the police.\n\nREAD: Everything we know about the 39 dead bodies found in a truck outside London.\n\nOfficials in Belgium say they are investigating how long the container was in the country before traveling to the U.K. and who was involved in organizing it. They said the container arrived in Zeebrugge at 2:49 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe National Crime Agency says it is trying to identify any \"organized crime groups who may have played a part.\u201d\n\nInitial reports suggested that the truck may have come from Bulgaria because it was registered there. \"The Scania truck was registered in Varna (on the east coast of Bulgaria) under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen,\u201d the Bulgarian foreign ministry said.\n\nThe police said the process of identifying the victims will be a lengthy one.\n\n\u201cEach of the 39 people must undergo a full coroner\u2019s process to establish a cause of death before we move on to attempting to identify each individual within the trailer,\u201d Essex Police said in a statement. \u201cThis will be a substantial operation and, at this stage, we cannot estimate how long these procedures will take.\u201d\n\nCover: Police officers drive away a lorry in which 39 dead bodies were discovered, sparking a murder investigation at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, east of London, on October 23, 2019.
