I find that the growing bullish sentiments since announcement of expected Modi-Trump trade deal by the end of this month, generated big bounce in Indian equity markets on September 26th, which rocketed Nifty 50 up to the levels of 11,698; added more fuel to bullish sentiments generated by Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman on September 20th, when Nifty 50 bounced with a steep upward move up to the level of 11,381 before closing at 11,274. No doubt that the resumption of the fresh developments related to a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump look evident of enough to extend exhaustion in U.S. equity markets and strong .\n\nI find that if the resumes sliding downward trend on September 26th, 2019 till closing and remains below the level of 2965; may see a gap down opening on September 27th, 2019, which may be followed by bouts of sell-offs till weekly closing; which may push the Nifty 50 below the level of 11, 400. No doubt that Nifty 50 still showing a lot of exhaustion due to growing bearishness in Nifty Bank and Nifty Auto.
