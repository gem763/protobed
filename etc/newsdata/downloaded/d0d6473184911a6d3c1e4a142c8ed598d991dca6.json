The presence of Colombian armed groups in Venezuela is further complicated by widespread access to guns in the troubled country, which suffers one of the world's highest rates of homicide.\n\n\"You have literally hundreds of thousands of military weapons that have gone missing from the Venezuelan armed forces,\" the official said.\n\nFormer rebel commanders Ivan Marquez and Jesus Santrich, in a video they said was filmed in Colombia's Amazon, accused Colombian President Ivan Duque's government of violating the peace accord and said the fighters would seek an alliance with the ELN.\n\nMaduro in July had said Marquez and Santrich, whose location at the time was not known, were welcome in Venezuela.\n\nThe office of opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has been recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate leader, on Friday said Guaido's envoy to Washington had met with U.S. authorities to warn that the FARC could regroup with Maduro's support.\n\n\"Unfortunately, these warnings have become a reality,\" Guaido's office said in statement.\n\nVenezuela's foreign ministry on Friday blamed the rearmament on Duque's failure to follow through on the peace accords.\n\nMaduro later tweeted that his government was committed to promoting peace in Colombia and would advance efforts to reestablish conversations between the two sides. Neither mentioned the issue of rebel presence in Venezuelan territory.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Brian Ellsworth, Editing by Franklin Paul)", "description": "The government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is increasingly providing shelter to Colombian rebel groups, a senior State Department official said in an interview, days after former FARC guerrillas announced a new offensive.
