His campaign was rocked by a September surprise: old photos of him in blackface and brown face. Yeah, Mr. Trudeau decided to double-dip in the \u2018this is problematic\u2019 political correctness pool that liberals wallow in on daily basis to the annoyance of the vast majority of us normal people (via NBC News):\n\n#BREAKING: A video \u2014 obtained exclusively by Global News\u2019 @MercedesGlobal \u2014 shows a third instance of Justin Trudeau in what appears to be racist makeup.#cdnpoli #elxn43 https://t.co/IEyeLFY0xc \u2014 Global National (@GlobalNational) September 19, 2019\n\nJustin Trudeau has won a second term as prime minister of Canada, overcoming recent scandals that had tarnished his standing as a leader of progressive politics in an age of growing right-wing nationalism, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and other major Canadian networks projected Monday night. Official results won't be announced until all votes are accounted for, but based on ballots already reported, the CBC, CTV News and Radio Canada projected that Trudeau's Liberal Party would win enough seats in the House of Commons to be able to form a minority government. Trudeau, 47, scored a far more commanding victory in 2015, ending the Conservative Party's nine-year grip on power. In 84 years, a first-term prime minister with a parliamentary majority has never lost re-election. [\u2026] Trudeau's campaign was roiled by scandal when images of him in brownface and blackface makeup as a young man resurfaced. He apologized, telling reporters in September that his behavior was \"unacceptable.\" The prime minister's prospects took a hit, and the scandal undercut his image as a champion of racial diversity and ethnic inclusivity. Trudeau's standing was also weakened earlier this year after his former attorney general claimed that he pressured her to stop prosecuting a top engineering company in Quebec. Trudeau insisted that he was protecting Canadian jobs, but the appearance of impropriety nonetheless dented his reputation. President Barack Obama, perhaps perceiving that Trudeau was politically endangered, last week made an unprecedented endorsement by a former U.S. president, calling on Canadians to give Trudeau a second term and advocating for his brand of progressive politics. \"I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term,\" Obama tweeted last Wednesday.\n\nHey, isn\u2019t that foreign interference in an election? It\u2019s such a joke. And for Obama, a black man, to defend this man\u2019s racist antics because he\u2019s a progressive exposed the greatest hypocrisy of all time on this issue. It\u2019s one that you\u2019ve known for quite some time. It\u2019s nothing new. It\u2019s only bad if Republicans do it, but circle the wagons when Democrats get a face full of buckshot engaging in racist escapades. Virginia\u2019s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam also admitted to doing blackface for a dance competition in the 1980s; he dressed up as Michael Jackson. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring also wore blackface in college. Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax is facing two allegations of rape. Yeah, we have a crackerjack group of clowns running Richmond in the Old Dominion.\n\nThis whole fiasco started when Northam\u2019s yearbook photo from his medical school days showed someone in blackface and another in full Ku Klux Klan regalia. Northam apologized for the racist costume, but which one is it? My money is on the KKK one, but that\u2019s just me. Northam personally submitted these photos for his page. Then, the train wreck followed. Northam backtracked the apology but admitted to the Michael Jackson blackface incident. So, he did blackface\u2026just not in his yearbook photo. It still doesn\u2019t negate the fact that he admitted and apologized for the initial photo. Also, I did blackface, but not in this photo isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call a solid defense. It made Richmond the brunt of many jokes\u2014and rightfully so. This is Democratic governance.\n\nThis scandal should\u2019ve derailed Northam, but it didn\u2019t. He\u2019s a Democrat. And unlike Canada, Virginia governors cannot run for re-election to consecutive terms. He dug in and with Herring and Fairfax also facing allegations that are worthy of resignation\u2014Northam couldn\u2019t allow the house of cards to fall. With all three men gone, the GOP would retake the governor\u2019s mansion. It\u2019s about power.\n\nWhat Northam and Trudeau prove is that liberal/progressive voters don\u2019t care about fighting racism. They only care about it if it eviscerates their conservative counterparts. Wearing blackface is problematic, right? It\u2019s also apparently rewarded with liberals re-electing a man who should be tarred and feathered as a racist, according to the liberals\u2019 rules on this; Trudeau and Northam should be destroyed. These men should be forever barred from ever serving in public office again. These are their rules.\n\nSo, now that Northam moonwalked and Trudeau rode the Magic Carpet\u2014he darkened his face for an Arabian Night event in 2001\u2014to re-election, the Left cannot lecture, be outraged over, or use blackface as an attack against their enemies. You people reward your kind for these antics. This discussion, which crossed international borders, is now done. The deal is this: Trudeau and Northam can remain in office, but I don\u2019t want to hear another screed about racism and how it\u2019s being supposedly promoted and advanced the GOP, Trump, the NRA, or whomever the Left associated with conservatism. We already ignore the Left for half of their weak sauce lectures about what\u2019s racist. Recently, SpongeBob Squarepants was blasted as a racist colonizer. Yes, asexual sea sponges are now racist agents. Get off the crack pipe. Stop huffing. Stop choking yourself with belts to get high. Liberals, stop doing whatever the hell you\u2019re doing that makes you think of this nonsense and just go away. Your people just re-elected a blackface/brownface PM to another term whose defense over the whole fiasco was pretty much that he didn\u2019t remember? Oh, he didn\u2019t remember, so it never happened, right? Wrong. I think it\u2019s a fair deal. Keep your guy in office, but then swallow this piping hot cup of shut the hell up over the subject of racism because you people have done more to advanced racist antics by re-electing Trudeau and doing nothing concerning Northam since the KKK marched in D.C.\n\nTake a bow, you pathetic, self-righteous pieces of scum.", "description": ".10/22/2019 9:23:29AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/93/9d5202c8-a723-4995-9a8d-174a474b53cd.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
