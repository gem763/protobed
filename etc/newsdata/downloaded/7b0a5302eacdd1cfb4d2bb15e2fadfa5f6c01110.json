Elliott said it owns about 2.5% of Marathon.\n\nD.E. Shaw, which owned a 0.9% stake as of the end of June, has also been pushing the second-largest U.S. oil refiner to explore ways to unlock value, according to people familiar with the matter. A representative for D.E. Shaw declined to comment.\n\nMarathon was the day\u2019s best performer in the S&P 500 Index with a gain of as much as 8.4%, the most since January 2017. The company will evaluate Elliott\u2019s proposal, according to an emailed statement.\n\nThe refiner\u2019s \u201cmanagement team and independent board have a strong track record of taking action to deliver shareholder value,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nMarathon has struggled to win investors\u2019 confidence after buying rival Andeavor last year for about $22 billion. Though the company earlier this year agreed to merge its Andeavor and MPLX LP pipeline units, Elliott says the corporate structure remains overly complex. The refiner has been one of the poorest-performing U.S. fuel makers, lagging peers like Phillips 66 and Valero Energy Corp.\n\nCarving Marathon up would create a path to address \u201cthe company\u2019s chronic underperformance, to improve its businesses and to unlock significant and sustainable value for its shareholders,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nUnder Elliott\u2019s plan, Marathon would split into three companies: Speedway convenience stores, MPLX pipeline assets and the refining business.\n\nMPLX, a master limited partnership, would convert to a traditional corporation in order to expand its potential investor base and \u201celiminate the overhang of a controlling corporate sponsor,\u201d according to a presentation. The new entity would be owned 63% by Marathon shareholders and 37% by current MPLX investors, Elliott said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Elliott has pushed for changes at Marathon. In 2016, it made a similar demand for the company to split its three main businesses. The Findlay, Ohio-based refiner took steps to simplify its pipeline partnership a year later at the hedge fund\u2019s urging, but rejected a proposal to spin off Speedway.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nMarathon has been looking to reduce the value leakage from MPLX\u2019s almost 10% yield, but it probably will resist Elliott\u2019s push to spin off its main growth platform. A roll-up seems unlikely, given Marathon\u2019s leverage and MPLX\u2019s size, but Elliott could accelerate planned asset sales.\n\n-- Fernando Valle and Michael Kay, senior industry analysts\n\nClick here to read the research\n\nMarathon Petroleum was spun off from Marathon Oil Corp. in 2011 and it has faced several activist battles since. Elliott\u2019s 2016 push came after Marathon was able to assuage complaints from Jana Partners by transferring some assets into a master-limited partnership.\n\nMarathon shares have slid more than 30% in the past year as the energy sector struggles to attract investor capital amid volatile crude prices. Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger told investors last month that it was continuing to focus on portfolio optimization, \u201cwhich could include asset divestitures to strategically streamline our integrated asset base.\u201d\n\nWhile peers such as Phillips 66 and Valero churned out total returns of 23% and 21%, respectively, in the two-year period ending at Tuesday\u2019s close, Marathon delivered a gain of less than 8%. Only PBF Energy Inc. lagged that result with a 6.4% return. These figures are based on share price performance plus reinvestment of dividends.\n\n(Updates with comment from Marathon in fourth, fifth paragraphs)\n\n--With assistance from Joe Carroll, Rachel Adams-Heard, Tina Davis and Christine Buurma.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: David Wethe in Houston at dwethe@bloomberg.net;Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.net;Catherine Ngai in New York at cngai16@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Christine Buurma\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Elliott Management Corp. renewed its push for Marathon Petroleum Corp. to split into three, a move the hedge fund said would unlock more than $22 billion in value.Marathon should divide into separate retail, midstream and refining companies, the hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer", "authors": ["David Wethe", "Scott Deveau", "Catherine Ngai"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/055aK9a4Q06TL1vvDs1oog--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/9b3cdd5f27bbbfc85bcc3f6a366a571b", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
