Both were granted bail.\n\nCity University student among first charged under the new mask ban\n\nSince Friday, radical protesters have gone on a rampaging spree, vandalising banks and stores associated with mainland China, trashing government buildings and train stations, targeting police by throwing significantly bigger petrol bombs, and engaging in bloody fist fights.\n\nThe gatherings on Monday were relatively smaller and less violent, but as night fell, protesters showed up in Mong Kok and Tseung Kwan O, with some setting up roadblocks in another confrontation with riot police, who fired tear gas and non-lethal rounds. Many were arrested.\n\nInto the evening, hundreds continued to block roads in Tai Koo and Mong Kok, with a march starting towards Yau Ma Tei. Sixteen train stations were vandalised, including Tseung Kwan O, Tsuen Wan, Sha Tin, Sha Tin Wai and City One, and five Light Rail stops.\n\nRiot police on the streets in Mong Kok.

The turnouts ranged from 100 to a few hundred.\n\nA man was punched in Sha Tin after he unfurled a Chinese flag in New Town Plaza mall, and said: \u201cHong Kong is a Chinese place.\u201d He boarded a bus after leaving the mall, but protesters stopped the vehicle from leaving, as another man punched him in the face. Riot police eventually arrived to escort the victim away.\n\nWith Monday marking the Chung Yeung Festival, protesters also gathered outside exit B1 of Prince Edward MTR station \u2013 near Mong Kok Police Station, a flashpoint \u2013 to burn paper offerings.\n\nHK government steps up measures for reporting class boycotts\n\nPrince Edward station was the scene of clashes between officers and protesters on August 31, which sparked rumours that people had died under police brutality. The force, Hospital Authority and fire service have all repeatedly debunked the accusations.\n\nAmong those who went to Prince Edward was Civic Party lawmaker Jeremy Tam Man-ho, who said he now believed people had died in the station.\n\nOn a footbridge connecting Kwai Fong MTR station to the Metroplaza mall, two banners were unfurled to criticise the city\u2019s embattled police and Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.\n\nPeople place flowers outside Prince Edward Station.

Ip said the government would not rule out using any means to stop violence.\n\nAnti-government protesters gather and sing at Tai Koo Shing.

Slogans such as \u201cReclaim Hong Kong; revolution of our times\u201d and \u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d were also chanted, echoing throughout the mall. Most of the shops in New Town Plaza began closing at around 5pm.\n\nTourism industry worker Anka Tam, 61, also said she came to support young people in their fight for democracy.\n\nShooting of teen protester by police inspires demonstrations across the city\n\n\u201cI will continue to come to the gatherings. I live nearby, so I have to pass by New Town Plaza on the way home. I don\u2019t think they have disrupted my everyday life. I avoid taking the MTR, and will take the bus when I head out,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Plaza Hollywood in Diamond Hill, more than 100 angry demonstrators and residents gathered at an atrium, chanting slogans such as \u201cHongkongers, resist\u201d and \u201cEveryone has a right to wear a mask\u201d, while singing songs of protest against the anti-mask law.\n\nA Form Three student surnamed Lee, who wore a surgical mask and led some of the slogan-chanting, said she defied the new law because \u201cwearing a mask is a human right, which should never be restricted by law\u201d.\n\nPolice fire tear gas in Mong Kok.
