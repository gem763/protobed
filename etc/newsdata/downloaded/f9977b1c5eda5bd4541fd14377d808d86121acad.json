Finish the job! We haven\u2019t yet invited Megan or the team, but I am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose.\u201d\n\nAfter the U.S. won the World Cup, Ms. Rapinoe told CNN no one on the team had \u201cany interest\u201d in going to The White House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone on the team has any interest in lending the platform that we\u2019ve worked hard to build and the things that we fight for and the way that we live our life,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we want that to be co-opted or corrupted by this administration.\u201d\n\nShe said in July the team accepted invitations to go to Washington and visit Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York and \u201canyone else that wants to invite us and have a substantive conversation and believe in the same things we believe in.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether that meetings happened.\n\nMs. Rapinoe \u2014 who has also been a vocal supporter of equal pay in women\u2019s sports \u2014 is not the first outspoken athlete Nike has made the face of an advertising campaign.\n\nA Nike ad campaign in 2018 drew criticism after including former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick saying: \u201cBelieve in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.\u201d\n\nMr. Kaepernick has been a controversial figure after he protested racial disparities and police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem. During the controversy, many condemned him as disrespecting the flag and military veterans, and Mr. Kaepernick has remained unsigned for three years.\n\nThe advertisement created calls of Nike boycotts over its perceived support of Mr. Kaepernick that went all the way up to President Trump.\n\n\u201cJust like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
