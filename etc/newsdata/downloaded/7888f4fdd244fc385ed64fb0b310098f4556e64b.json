The brackets continue all the way up to an 8 per cent tax on net worth above $10bn (\u00a38bn), and would be cut in half for single filers, according to the proposal.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times about his new plan, which he would seek to have implemented if elected to the White House in 2020, Mr Sanders said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that billionaires should exist.\u201d\n\nThe senator has long called for a wealth tax programme, writing in his 1997 book Outsider in the House that it was \u201chigh time to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries\u201d.\n\nMs Warren\u2019s plan also includes a tax of 3 per cent on household net worth above $1bn (\u00a3801.7m), though it does not offer the sliding scale for increased wealth that Mr Sanders has proposed.\n\nMr Sanders takes the idea of taxing the richest Americans to fund his programmes a step further, however, sharply reducing the total wealth of US billionaires over a 15-year period.\n\nRead more\n\nBernie Sanders tells off crowd for cheering David Koch's death\n\n\u201cThis proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that's exactly what we should be doing,\u201d Mr Sanders told the NYT.\n\nHis plan is entitled \u201cTax on Extreme Wealth\u201d. In a statement, Mr Sanders described the plan as part of an effort \u201cto reduce the outrageous level of inequality that exists in America today and to rebuild the disappearing middle class.\u201d\n\nThe plan also includes a series of enforcement policies meant to ensure \u201cthat the wealthy are not able to evade the tax,\u201d including increased funding to the Internal Revenue Service and requiring IRS audits for all billionaires.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\n\u201cUnder this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class,\u201d Mr Sanders said.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Bernie Sanders tells off crowd for cheering David Koch's death", "description": "Bernie Sanders has unveiled an aggressive new wealth tax proposal to fund his sweeping social programmes that would outdo a plan put forth by fellow 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren.The Vermont senator released his policy idea on Tuesday morning and said it would raise an estimated $4.35tn (\u00a33.5tn) over", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0pXC0QaAcMwcL8Qqx.KDLQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/af799a31c0043a4e6fad9d4172bf5450", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
