A Brexit referendum was not inevitable and the blame lies with him", "language": "en", "text": "What a pity that David Cameron didn\u2019t quietly nudge the Queen to intervene in the EU referendum, as he did before the one on Scottish independence two years earlier.\n\nCould the \u201craising of an eyebrow\u2026 even a quarter of an inch\u201d, have tipped the Brexit vote too? Perhaps, if the Queen had repeated her 2014 hope that \u201cpeople will think very carefully about the future\u201d.\n\nThe pro-Brexit press claims the Queen as one of their own. It would, wouldn\u2019t it? Buckingham Palace disputed a headline that she backed Brexit. We don\u2019t know her views. We do know her prime minister believed strongly it was in the national interest to remain in the EU, not least for economic reasons. True, she is not the Queen of Europe. But with no deal still in the frame, we know now Brexit could be the catalyst for the breakup of the UK, with the possible loss of Northern Ireland as well as Scotland. We know the Queen\u2019s view about that.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn an unprecedented rebuke, the palace made clear its \u201cdispleasure and annoyance\u201d that Cameron disclosed to the BBC his request for her to intervene in the Scottish referendum. But the former prime minister might not lose too much sleep about the controversy. It draws more attention to his very readable memoirs, For the Record, and shifts the spotlight to a referendum he won rather than lost.\n\nBut not for long. He will never escape the shadow of Brexit. I found his argument that an EU referendum was inevitable unconvincing. This is, after all, the man who once told his party to stop \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d. He could have continued to stand up to the headbangers doing the banging. He did so when he took on his party on issues such as gay marriage. I was in the Tory conference hall when he announced his support for it. The few seconds of silence felt much longer. Would somebody heckle or shout \u201cno!?\u201d Eventually, Tory members applauded, a seminal moment in Cameron\u2019s successful modernisation of his party.\n\nHe could have shown brave leadership on Europe too. Instead, he allowed the Eurosceptic tail to wag the dog, and we are where we are today. Cameron argues convincingly that Boris Johnson came out for Leave because it was the right thing for his Tory leadership ambitions rather than the country. But Cameron made a similar, if lower-profile, choice when he pledged to pull his party out of the mainstream centre-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP) during the 2005 leadership contest. His main rival, David Davis, reckoned the move cost him the votes of 40 Tory MPs. In the book, Cameron denies \u201copportunistic reasons\u201d but admits it undoubtedly helped him win over Eurosceptic MPs.\n\nThe decision would return to haunt him. Angela Merkel, the EPP\u2019s figurehead and most important player on the EU stage, never understood it or forgave him. Might Cameron have won a better deal if he had renegotiated the UK\u2019s membership terms from inside the EPP family? I suspect so.\n\nThis was part of a pattern. Cameron joined the Brussels-bashing that began in the Thatcher era; he should not have been surprised it was hard to make the case for EU membership in the referendum. Cameron insists he was not \u201cappeasing populism\u201d but confronting it head-on. Yet George Osborne, his close ally who warned against a referendum, was right when he told the BBC series The Cameron Years: \u201cDavid Cameron was just one of a number of British prime ministers who had fed this idea that we were different than Europe, that Brussels was to blame and that the public ultimately had to have a say, and we\u2019ve all paid a price for it in my view.\u201d\n\nHis book does nothing to dispel my view that Cameron got his referendum timing all wrong. Perhaps through his natural over-confidence, and a desire to move on to the social issues he wanted his legacy to be, he told civil servants he wanted the public vote at the earliest possible date. The legislation allowed him to delay it until December 2017. His book omits the crucial factor that just might have tipped a 2017 referendum the other way. Would the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House have convinced enough voters that the UK\u2019s most reliable friends and natural partners laid closer to home?\n\nCameron could have had a very different legacy \u2013 10 years in Downing Street, a groundbreaking coalition and completing unfinished business such as a cap on social care costs (one of his greatest regrets), as well as on mental health and life chances. Unfortunately, history\u2019s verdict might be unkinder to him because the Brexit story is not over yet. The man who pledged to keep Scotland in the UK and Britain in the EU might yet fail spectacularly on both fronts.", "description": "What a pity that David Cameron didn\u2019t quietly nudge the Queen to intervene in the EU referendum, as he did before the one on Scottish independence two years earlier.
