That coincided with confirmation from the DUP that their position hasn\u2019t changed, which suggests they won\u2019t support the deal on Saturday, making the parliamentary arithmetic on Saturday even tighter.\n\nAnyone hoping that the process will be straightforward now is kidding themselves. With Labour whipping for a second referendum on the deal and the Lib Dems unlikely to support anything, there is still a good chance we\u2019re heading for an extension and election, in order to get this over the line. Nothing in Brexit is ever simple.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a wild weekend which will make the market open next week all the more unpredictable. If the deal gets through Parliament, the pound could perform extremely well at the start of next week, despite having already rebounded more than 8% from the lows a month ago.\n\nGBP/USD Daily Chart\n\nGBP/USD Daily Chart\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by MarketPulse (Craig Erlam) covering: GBP/USD.
