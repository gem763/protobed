It was a scam but they were so convincing.\n\n\u201cYou wake up in the middle of the night and all you can think about is the fact you have been so gullible and you\u2019ve lost your money.\n\n\u201cI am devastated and think I was rather fool\u00adish and gullible to be taken in by such sweet talk. I\u2019m not a young man any more.\n\n\u201cIf speaking out stops one other person falling for the same thing then I\u2019ll be pleased I\u2019ve done it.\u201d\n\nOf grandchildren Rosie Curry and Anna Brown he said: \u201cIt\u2019s them that have been deprived.\n\n\u201cMy life\u2019s nearly over but they are in their mid-twenties and have their lives in front of them and they need a house.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\n\nJohn, who also worked as an engineer, put the phone down on the fraudsters when they first called.\n\nBut they phoned back 20 minutes later using the fake number.\n\nThe father-of-one, married to wife Pat, 86, for 26 years, said of the crooks: \u201cThey are living on other people\u2019s money.\n\n\u201cThey pick on vulnerable people and take a chance. They were ex\u00ad\u00ad\u00adtremely convincing.\n\n\u201cI was not scared at the time because I thought I was in good hands.\n\n\u201cBut I could not sleep at night afterwards. I had to take tablets.\u201d\n\n(Image: John Thompson / SWNS)\n\nJohn, from Sprotbrough, Doncaster, has spent the last 50 years saving and this year sold a huge model railway set, which took 15 years to build, for \u00a37,000.\n\nAndy Foster, fraud-protection officer with South Yorkshire Police, said: \u201cSadly, Mr Thompson\u2019s story is all too familiar.\n\n\u201cI have met countless victims of sim\u00ad\u00adilar telephone scams. The fact crooks are now able to make it look like they are calling from a local number, or the number of your bank, makes their dev\u00ad\u00adious schemes even more convincing.\u201d\n\nJohn says he has been unable to get a refund from Nationwide as it views the transaction as an \u201cauthorised push payment\u201d, meaning he moved the money himself.\n\nNew protection was brought in earlier this year for people tricked into transferring money to fraudsters but not all banks are signed up.\n\nUnder the code, anyone who has taken reasonable care or has an element of vulnerability, is much more likely to receive a refund.\n\nA JustGiving page has been set up to help replace John\u2019s savings.", "description": "John Thompson, from Sprotbrough, Doncaster, has spent the last 50 years saving and had been hoping to give the cash to his two granddaughters to help them buy houses", "authors": ["Lucy Thornton", "Image", "Tom Maddick", "Swns", "John Thompson"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20553323.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_OAP_SCAM_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
