It can also help you when it comes to applying for jobs and responding to listings featured on the site.\n\nAnd in order to take full advantage of these features, it's a good idea to have a resume uploaded to your profile.\n\nIf you don't have a resume ready, you could use LinkedIn's download feature, which takes all of the information you've included on your profile and converts it into a PDF resume. To do this, go to your profile page, click the \"More\" button then select \"save to PDF.\"\n\nBut that downloaded resume is likely not as aesthetically pleasing as a resume you created yourself, and it will likely be longer than you want.\n\nSo uploading a customized resume to your profile is usually the better option. Plus, it's always a good idea to tailor the information included in your resume to better fit the job you're applying for. That way, you'll stand out in the right ways.\n\nHere's what you need to know in order to upload your resume to your LinkedIn profile.\n\nHow to upload your resume on LinkedIn\n\nAssuming you know where you stored your resume on your computer, this should only take a minute or two to complete:\n\n1. Go to linkedin.com and log into your account, if necessary.\n\n2. Click the \"Me\" tab in the top toolbar, then select \"View Profile.\"\n\n3.
