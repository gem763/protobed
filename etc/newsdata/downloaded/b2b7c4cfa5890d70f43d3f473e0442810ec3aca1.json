The identities of the other detainees have not been confirmed.\n\nHer account, which has been suspended, was reported to have had more than 600,000 followers.\n\nHojabri has since appeared on a state television programme with other detainees, in which she and others made what activists say were forced confessions, a tactic often used by Iranian authorities.\n\nState TV showed a young woman, her face blurred, crying and shaking while describing her motivation for producing the videos.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for attracting attention,\u201d she said. \u201cI had some followers and these videos were for them. I did not have any intention to encourage others doing the same \u2026 I didn\u2019t work with a team, I received no training. I only do gymnastics.\u201d\n\nLittle is known about Hojabri\u2019s personal life, or which city in Iran she is from, but since her arrest her videos have been shared by hundreds of people, giving her a reach beyond her account.\n\nThey appear to have often been taken using a camera in her bedroom while she danced to western pop and rap music without wearing a hijab, which is required in public.\n\nNegar (@NegarMortazavi) Teenage dancer, Maedeh Hojabri, was arrested in Iran. She used to record dance videos in her bedroom and upload them to her instagram with 600K followers.#\u0645\u0627\u0626\u062f\u0647_\u0647\u0698\u0628\u0631\u0649 pic.twitter.com/3EDVR9veV3\n\nIn another video, she talked about the history of parkour, an outdoor sport popular in Iran, especially among women who practise it while wearing the headscarf.\n\nMasih Alinejad \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f (@AlinejadMasih) Her name is Maeade Mahi. Recently she got arrested just because of uploading her dancing videos on her Instagram. If you are a woman in Iran and you dance or sing or show your hair then you are a criminal. If you want to enjoy your true self, you have to brake the laws every day. pic.twitter.com/0eIq5ld5x6\n\nHossein Ronaghi, a blogger, said: \u201cPeople would laugh at you if you tell anyone in the world that [in Iran] they arrest 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds for dancing, being happy and being beautiful, for spreading indecency, and instead paedophiles are free.\u201d\n\nMany people think authorities will ban Instagram, which remains one of the few unblocked western apps. Facebook and Twitter are filtered.\n\nThe head of Tehran\u2019s cyber-police, Touraj Kazemi, said his forces were identifying and would take action against popular accounts on Instagram. In 2012, Iran sacked the head of its cyber-police after the blogger Sattar Beheshti died in custody.\n\nIn 2014, a group of Pharrell Williams fans arrested for filming themselves dancing to the song Happy on the rooftops of Tehran received suspended sentences of imprisonment and lashes.", "description": "Arrests of app users including Maedeh Hojabri after posting videos prompt outrage", "authors": ["Saeed Kamali Dehghan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c9b15338422e74fbefe6658a88dec5f8286a2a/0_19_522_313/master/522.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bd693df5ead2b3d6f5af7210d367c64d", "published_at": "2018-07-08"}
