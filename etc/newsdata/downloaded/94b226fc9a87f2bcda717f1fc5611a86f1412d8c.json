(U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for Utah/AP)\n\nWhile opioid-related deaths remain at nearly an all-time high in Maryland, preliminary data shows a decline in fatal overdoses for the second straight quarter \u2014 the first six-month drop in the last decade.\n\nState officials released a preliminary report Tuesday that found that there were 1,060 \u00adopioid-related deaths in Maryland in the first half of the year, 133 fewer \u2014 or an 11 percent decline \u2014 than in the first six months of 2018.\n\nSteven R. Schuh, executive director of Maryland\u2019s Opioid Operational Command Center, said 13 of the state\u2019s 24 jurisdictions saw fewer opioid-related deaths. Ten jurisdictions reported increases, including Talbot County, with six more deaths than a year ago, and Baltimore City and Kent County, each with five more deaths than in the first half of 2018.\n\nBaltimore City, Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County had the highest number of \u00adopioid-related fatalities, collectively accounting for 66.8 percent of all such deaths in Maryland in the first half of 2019.\n\nSchuh said in a statement that he was encouraged by the preliminary data, but he acknowledged that \u201cthe heroin and opioid crisis in Maryland is by no means over.\u201d\n\nThe state plans to spend $747 million in fiscal 2020 on opioid-related programs, up from $674 million this fiscal year. State spending on opioid-related programs has jumped by nearly 68 percent in the past three years.\n\n\u201cWhile we know there is still much work to be done with regard to this epidemic, the decline of heroin- and opioid-related deaths over the first two quarters of 2019 gives us hope that we are on the right track,\u201d Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford (R), who leads the state Heroin and Opioid Emergency Task Force, said in a statement.\n\nThe six-month tally is similar to the 12-month total in 2015, when 1,089 people died, and nearly double the number of fatalities in 2009. Last year, 2,143 people suffered opioid-related deaths.\n\nMaryland also experienced a drop in the deaths caused by fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, in the first six months of 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018.\n\nThere were 942 fentanyl-related deaths from January to June 2019, 7.8 percent fewer than in the first half of 2018.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs spending on opioid epidemic soars, Md. officials say death rate is \u2018starting to plateau\u2019\n\nFor the first time in 10 years, fatal opioid overdoses decline in Maryland\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "State officials are encouraged but say the crisis \u201cis by no means over.\u201d", "authors": ["Ovetta Wiggins", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ks5XNU1GufcE8NgX-DO18WMoGUg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWITL2B3MEI6TIWNGB5QNUBFPM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
