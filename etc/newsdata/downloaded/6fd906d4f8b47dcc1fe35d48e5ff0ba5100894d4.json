The Turkish air strikes had killed two civilians and wounded two others, the SDF said.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan, announcing the start of the action, said the aim was to eliminate what he called a \u201cterror corridor\u201d on Turkey\u2019s southern border.\n\nBut U.S. President Donald Trump, who ordered the U.S. pullout last week in an abrupt policy shift, said the offensive was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and he did not endorse it. He expected Turkey to protect civilians and religious minorities and to prevent a humanitarian crisis, he said.\n\nEuropean countries called on Ankara to halt the operation and Egypt called it \u201ca blatant and unacceptable attack on a brotherly Arab state\u201d.\n\nTurkey had been poised to enter northeast Syria since the U.S. troops who had been fighting with Kurdish-led forces against Islamic State started to leave in what Trump critics called a betrayal of Washington\u2019s allies.\n\nA Turkish security source told Reuters the military offensive, dubbed \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d, opened with air strikes. Turkish howitzer fire then hit bases and ammunition depots of the Kurdish YPG militia.\n\nThe artillery strikes, which also targeted YPG gun and sniper positions, were aimed at sites far from residential areas, the source said.\n\nA Reuters cameraman in the Turkish town of Akcakale saw several explosions across the border in the Syrian town of Tel Abyad. A witness said people were fleeing en masse.\n\nExplosions also rocked Ras al Ain, just across the border from the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar, a CNN Turk reporter said. The sound of warplanes could he heard above and smoke was rising from buildings in Ras al Ain, he said.\n\nThe SDF said military positions and civilians in the city of Qamishli and the town of Ain Issa - more than 30 km (20 miles) inside Syria - had been hit, and said there were initial reports of civilian casualties.\n\nTurkish media said mortar and rocket fire from Syria struck the Turkish border towns of Ceylanpinar and Nusaybin. There were no immediate reports of casualties there.\n\nFrom Akcakale, the red flare of rockets could be seen being fired after dark across the border to Tel Abyad, as well as flames near the town. In Ras al Ain, burning tyres sent black columns of smoke into the sky, in an apparent effort to thwart attacks.\n\nWORSE TURMOIL\n\nWorld powers fear the Turkish action could open a new chapter in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war and worsen regional turmoil. Ankara has said it intends to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in order to return millions of refugees to Syrian soil.\n\nIn the build-up to the anticipated offensive, Syria had said it was determined to confront any Turkish aggression by all legitimate means.\n\nTurkey views Kurdish YPG fighters in northeast Syria as terrorists because of their ties to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey. An influx of non-Kurdish Syrians would help it secure a buffer against its main security threat.\n\nAmid deepening humanitarian concerns, Germany said Turkey\u2019s action would lead to further instability and could strengthen Islamic State, which the U.S.-armed SDF helped defeat in Syria.\n\nThe SDF halted operations against Islamic State because of the Turkish offensive, two U.S. officials and a Kurdish source said. One of the officials said U.S. training of forces in Syria had also been affected.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council will meet on Thursday at the request of European countries, who expressed alarm at the offensive, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the bloc would not fund Ankara\u2019s plans in the region.\n\nSmoke rises from the Syrian side of the border as it is pictured from the Turkish town of Akcakale in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 9, 2019.

Trump has denied he had abandoned the forces, the most capable U.S. partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish-led authority in northern Syria declared a state of \u201cgeneral mobilization\u201d before calling on its people to head towards the border \u201cto fulfil their moral duty and show resistance in these sensitive, historic moments\u201d.\n\nErdogan\u2019s communications director Fahrettin Altun said Turkey had no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralize the threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local people from what he called \u201cthe yoke of armed thugs\u201d.\n\nTurkey was taking over leadership of the fight against Islamic State in Syria, he said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Demiroren news agency said Turkish-backed Syrian rebels had travelled from northwest Syria to Turkey in preparation for the incursion.\n\n\u201cStrike them with an iron fist, make them taste the hell of your fires,\u201d the National Army told its fighters.\n\nRUSSIA CALLS FOR DIALOGUE\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, urged dialogue between Damascus and Syria\u2019s Kurds on solving issues in northeast Syria.\n\n\u201cWe will do our best to support the start of such substantive talks,\u201d Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nOn Monday, Erdogan said U.S. troops started to pull back after a call he had with Trump. The U.S. president\u2019s decision to withdraw troops has rattled allies, including France and Britain, two of Washington\u2019s main partners in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.\n\nThe operation also had an impact on the Turkish lira, which slid 0.5%, breaking through what traders called a key support level of 5.85 against the dollar to its weakest level since August.", "description": "Turkey attacked Kurdish militia positions in northeast Syria on Wednesday, pounding them with air strikes and artillery barrages in a cross-border military operation just days after U.S. troops pulled back from the area.", "authors": ["Mert Ozkan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438945642&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981OM", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
