No matter what success means to you, sometimes it will come slowly and not exactly as soon as you thought it would.\n\nUnsplash\n\n\n\nSuccess follows a series of events. There are big and small achievements, there's fear, building and shattering confidence and more importantly, disappointment. The hurdles along the way challenge your integrity, stigma, courage and the urge to keep going.\n\nSometimes, you will put in all the effort into achieving what you want, but eventually feel like all your hard work is going in vain. Sometimes, there is no one to pat your back for your little achievements. No one is even listening as to why you are failing.\n\nUnsplash\n\n\n\nYou might not get the desired reaction you were expecting. You might feel jealous of your friends who are doing so much better than you in life. You might stop meeting them because you feel you're not good enough. You might look at that one photo of your colleague with a perfect life partner and cry your heart out of not being anywhere near a milestone like that. You might not get that perfect body you thought you'll have by the end of the year. Even after slogging day and night your grades might not get better. You might feel worthless at the end of the day, with tears in your eyes only your pillow will know of.\n\nunsplash\n\n\n\nHowever, you must keep going.\n\nPeople will tell you a thousand different ways to be successful, but what works for them might not work for you. We all have different journeys and paths we are walking on, but the things that remain common, are perseverance and patience. Not giving up even when everything in your life seems to be falling apart is the key to success.\n\nYou never know who is praising your hard work behind your back. You might not realise that someone is looking up to you for your courage. You may not know that someone is envying you for being able to persevere. One simple truth is that you can do anything, if you don't give up on it; success will cost you and you must be ready to pay.\n\nUnsplash\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll be rewarded. You\u2019ll be acknowledged. You\u2019ll feel special. You will be loved. You will find your position in the workplace. Your parents will feel proud of you. You will feel full.\n\nIt\u2019ll just take some time. Be patient and enjoy the person you are becoming along the way. Let yourself evolve because that is also success.", "description": "Success follows a series of events that takes an eternity.
