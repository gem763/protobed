I think that's an important factor,\" Mr Wardell-Johnson said.\n\nThe OECD proposed countries should be given the right to tax a proportion of the global profits, wherever firms are based.\n\nTax will be calculated using the group operating profit, minus the portion referable to routine profits, and the portion referable to non-market factors, such as trade intangibles. Market-based residual profits will then be allocated to market jurisdictions.\n\nDeloitte tax insights and policy partner David Watkins said existing international tax frameworks were under stress from a globalised and digitalised business environment.\n\n\"As always, identifying the problem is the easy part \u2014 agreeing on a global workable solution is much harder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The OECD release, whilst not yet reflecting an international consensus, represents an important step. It seeks to establish a sustainable model that allocates additional taxing rights to the market or user country to address concerns that the current tax rules do not sufficiently recognise the contribution of the market.\"\n\nHe said it was significant for Australia that extractive industries are out of scope.\n\n\"The objective is to do this in a way that minimises complexity, increases certainty and importantly, maintains a consistent international framework.\"\n\nAshurst tax partner Paul Miller said the proposals were expressly designed to increase the tax actually paid by larger cross-border businesses in \"market jurisdictions\".\n\n\"So there is a question as to whether there is sufficient international political will to finalise and implement these proposals.\n\n\"If not, such businesses will instead probably have to cope with a range of fragmented domestic approaches in those jurisdictions where they do business.\"\n\nJones Day partner Niv Tadmore said a milestone change to the international tax framework could be close.\n\n\u201cImportantly for Australia, as this would be limited to digital commerce, extractive industries will be excluded, although once the tax framework starts to change at the core level there is no guarantee that this carve out will remain in place in the longer term,\" he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of detail is still to be worked out, and there will be a dispute resolution regime aimed at resolving disputes between countries on how to tax the revenue, for example to prevent double-taxation.\"", "description": "A new global tax plan would hit profits in a country irrespective of whether companies had a physical presence there but extractive industries are so far excluded.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5132733f0289264be3527218a9dae1eb9e61becd", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
