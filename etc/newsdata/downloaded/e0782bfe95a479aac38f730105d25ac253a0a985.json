He also said he's scrapping peace talks with the Taliban altogether.\n\n\"Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, [the Taliban] admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people,\" Trump added. \"I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations.\"\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are seemingly disgusted the US was negotiating with the Taliban on any level, and scoffed at the idea of its leaders coming to the US so close to the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks; the US declared war on the Taliban for harboring Osama bin Laden and other terrorists a month after the 2001 attacks.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, an Air Force veteran who served in Afghanistan as well as Iraq, told CNN on Sunday he's in \"disbelief\" that Taliban leaders were set to come to a region in the US so close to where the attacks occurred \"in the week of 9/11.\"\n\n\"Negotiations between nation states can happen there, but a terrorist organization that doesn't recognize nation states, that kills innocent women and children, that denies women the right to really even be in the same room as their husbands ... to have them at Camp David is totally unacceptable,\" Kinzinger said.\n\nIn a tweet, Kinzinger also said, \"Never should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn't renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop.\"\n\nRep. Michael Waltz of Florida, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, on Sunday told CNN: \"As we head into the anniversary of 9/11, I do not ever want to see these terrorists step foot on United States soil. Period.\"\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming in a tweet said, \"Camp David is where America's leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11. No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever. The Taliban still harbors al Qaeda.\"\n\nCheney also said, \"The President is right to end the talks.\"\n\nFearing his wrath and the electoral consequences, Republican lawmakers rarely criticize the president these days, which makes the public rebuke of the Taliban invitation significant.\n\nDespite the criticism, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the move and on Sunday said, \"It's almost always the case. ... that you don't get to negotiate with good guys.\" He also referred to Camp David as the \"perfectly appropriate place\" for such talks.\n\nTrump appears desperate for a win on the global stage, but faces an utter quagmire in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump campaigned on ending America's involvement in forever wars, and ending the conflict in Afghanistan \u2014 the longest war in US history \u2014 has been essential to that goal.\n\nThe US has few solid options for an exit from Afghanistan, which was recently ranked the most violent country in the world, and has seemingly accepted peace talks with the Taliban as one of the least-awful routes forward.\n\nBut with ongoing, deadly Taliban attacks and a surging ISIS-affiliate also wreaking havoc in Afghanistan, that task has proved difficult for Trump.\n\nIn his apparent desperation for win on the global stage, Trump turned to inviting Taliban leaders to the presidential retreat at Camp David, a site with a storied history when it comes to US diplomacy.\n\nBut Trump reportedly overruled his top advisers with this move, including Vice President Mike Pence. Behind-the-scenes, National Security Adviser John Bolton and defense officials warned Trump that inviting \"a designated terrorist organization\" to Camp David would \"set a terrible precedent,\" Foreign Policy reported. On Monday, Trump and Pence disputed reports that Pence and other advisors had disagreed with Trump's plan to hold talks.\n\nThis all occurred less than a week after the top US negotiator in the US-Taliban talks said a peace deal had been met \"in principle,\" which would involve withdrawing roughly 5,400 US troops from five bases in Afghanistan within 135 days.", "description": "The Taliban invitation and subsequent backlash adds to an expanding list of foreign policy controversies and failures for Trump ahead of 2020.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GjVmG.cHoT7mnPFHrvIguw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/9cc021aa5f46f9729e175e19530a4675", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
