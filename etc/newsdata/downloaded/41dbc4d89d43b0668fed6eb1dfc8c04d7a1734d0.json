According to The Post, those officials have received letters notifying them that their emails from years ago have been retroactively classified and their transmission could constitute security violations.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON CALLS TRUMP 'ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT' AND 'CORRUPT HUMAN TORNADO'\n\nState Department investigators began contacting the officials around a year and a half ago, then the investigation seemed to fall by the wayside before picking up steam again last month, officials said.\n\nSenior State Department officials denied they were acting at the specific direction of President Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe process is set up in a manner to completely avoid any appearance of political bias,\u201d a senior State Department official told The Post.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with who is in the White House,\u201d said a second senior State Department official.\u201cThis is about the time it took to go through millions of emails ...\u201d\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIES 23 VIOLATIONS, 'MULTIPLE SECURITY INCIDENTS' CONCERNING CLINTON EMAILS\n\nSeveral of those questioned, however, told the Post that investigators seemed to be pursuing the matter \"reluctantly, and under external pressure.\"\n\nJeffrey Feltman, a former assistant secretary for Near East Affairs, told the paper he found the recent retroactive classification of more than 50 of his emails to be out of the ordinary. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that this is just routine, but something strange is going on.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThose being investigated will not face criminal prosecution since the FBI investigation of the Clinton email case closed before the 2016 election.\n\nThe FBI began investigating Clinton's use of a private email server in July 2015 based on a referral from the intelligence community inspector general.
