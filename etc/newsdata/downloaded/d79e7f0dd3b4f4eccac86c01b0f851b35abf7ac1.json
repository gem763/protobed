But she was just warming up.\n\nWe can\u2019t be more than a day away from her calling Trump the Kingdom\u2019s cuck.\n\nYou can see from this, though, why Gabbard is unusually popular on the right for a left-wing Democrat. It\u2019s not just that she\u2019s a veteran or a nationalist who\u2019s largely in sync with Tucker Carlson\u2019s sensibilities. It\u2019s not just that she\u2019s a little better than most lefties about abortion or border enforcement either. This sort of hard rhetorical shot is distinctly populist precisely because it\u2019s so hard. Grassroots activists pride themselves on not pulling their punches. Gabbard doesn\u2019t pull them either, even when she\u2019s swinging at the alpha-male-in-chief.\n\nHere\u2019s the presidential tweet that has her exercised. It really is terrible.\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nThe last phrase, \u201cunder what terms we would proceed,\u201d particularly reeks of subservience. Trump would doubtless say that he simply meant he\u2019d coordinate with the Saudis on any reprisal against Iran, but he held a less nuanced view of U.S./Saudi cooperation back in 2014:\n\nSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won't, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth-$ trillion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2014\n\nI think the Times is right about his evolution: The difference between the Saudis and other U.S. allies is that Trump understands keenly how a rift between our country and theirs might affect oil prices. And spiraling oil prices are a dangerous thing for a president who\u2019s laser-focused on an economic pitch for his reelection.\n\nIt was hard to imagine him allowing NATO, or a European ally, such latitude to determine how the United States should respond. But for Mr. Trump, the Saudis have always been a special case, their economic import having often overwhelmed other considerations in his mind\u2026 [His tweet] was strange for many reasons. Mr. Pompeo had already named the Iranians as the culprits; Mr. Trump did not. But the seeming abdication of fact-finding and decision-making to the Saudis gave Democrats a moment to argue that the president was willing to let the Saudi monarchy make decisions for the United States\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s not remotely normal for a president to talk publicly about that, to use language that sounds as if we aren\u2019t making our own decisions about whether to use force \u2014 or trusting our own intelligence,\u201d [natsec analyst Heather Hurlburt] said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s completely unprecedented with a country that is not a treaty ally.\u201d\n\nRemember what his answer was last year to complaints that he was letting the Saudis off scot-free for murdering an American resident, Jamal Khashoggi, who\u2019d criticized the regime? \u201cThey buy a lot of weapons from us.\u201d\n\nSo long as they keep the money and oil flowing, sure, we\u2019ll act as their mercenary army in the Middle East. News is breaking just this afternoon, in fact, that American and Saudi investigators have jointly concluded that the attack on the Kingdom\u2019s oil facilities last week was launched from an Iranian base near the border with Iraq, not by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels fighting the Saudis in Yemen. A reprisal will be required. I doubt Tulsi and Tucker will like how it plays out.\n\nHere\u2019s Gabbard laying into Trump for his deference towards MBS. It should go without saying at this point that she\u2019s in no position to criticize others for being stooges of foreign powers.", "description": "\"You are unfit to serve as our commander-in-chief.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tg-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
