A classic example is the political and media overreaction to Monday\u2019s stories concerning Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr and impeachment.\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s alleged misdeed is that he was among those listening to Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 telephone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. But why shouldn\u2019t a Secretary of State be on a call to the new President of an important country? U.S. foreign policy is the secretary\u2019s job. As far as we know, Mr. Pompeo isn\u2019t responsible for Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to mention Joe Biden in that conversation. This is not impeachable behavior, or even impeachment news.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAs for Mr. Barr, he is supposedly implicated because he asked Mr. Trump to ask Prime Minister Scott Morrison for Australia\u2019s cooperation with the Justice Department probe of illegal foreign influence in the 2016 election. Mr. Barr and prosecutors have also sought the cooperation of other foreign governments.\n\nWe certainly hope they have. Everyone has known for some time that Justice is investigating what happened in 2016, and Justice made that public last week in a statement when the transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s Ukraine phone call was released.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING THIS EDITORIAL IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL", "description": "Washington is in an impeachment frenzy, which is a dangerous moment for facts and context.", "authors": ["Wall Street Journal Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/14/694940094001_6086178054001_6086178997001-vs.jpg"}
