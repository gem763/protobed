A close-up of the apparently glazed side dish that accompanied the Halloween bell pepper dish on the presidential jet\n\nKosinski wrote: 'Yes, it could be the next big internet mystery: is it chicken n gravy, or scone n frosting? Is it black and pink, or yellow and white? A trick, or treat? America demands answers.'\n\nThe photo shows a rather innocuous main dish of a stuffed yellow bell pepper with a face etched on it, served on a bed of green salad with roasted cherry tomatoes.\n\nIn the background is a hard-to-identify side dish or dessert which people have suggested could be bread or dessert. What is certain is that no-one is certain.\n\nThe presidential jet can provide 100 meals in one sitting and has capacity for 3,000 frozen meals held in five chillers. It's unclear whether Mr Trump was actually served the same meal that the journalists on board received.\n\nTRUMP'S 'AIR FORCE ONE': INSIDE THE MILITARY-GRADE BOEING 747-200 THAT HAS AN ONBOARD HOSPITAL Commissioned by Ronald Reagan, the Boeing 747-200s entered service in 1990 and have carried presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. They will fly the winner of the 2020 election. Any U.S. Air Force aircraft that is transporting the president has the call sign Air Force One when the president is on board, but the presidents' most normal transport since 1990 has been the 747-200s, known as VC-25s to the Air Force. The two VC-25s will be replaced by 2024 with converted Boeing 747-800s which are larger and can fly longer distances. But Trump has made the next generation of Air Force One controversial by abandoning the livery first used by John F. Kennedy and associated with his wife Jackie, in favor of a red white and blue design which critics said made it look like his 'Trump Force One.'

Is that a frozen sloth head or a roll of some kind?'\n\nA more sensible @meralee727 edged her bets, saying: 'I thought it was chicken or like a cinnamon roll thing?'\n\nIt wasn't long before a little editing came into play either, with many turning the bright yellow bell pepper into a Trump-lookalike, adding his trademark side-swiped hair.", "description": "It may be one of the world's most luxurious planes but, judging by a photo that's gone viral, passengers on Air Force One clearly aren't getting any better meals than your average seat in coach.", "authors": ["Jo Tweedy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20371628-0-image-a-24_1572435015045.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
