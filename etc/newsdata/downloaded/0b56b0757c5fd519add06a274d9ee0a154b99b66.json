Lots of islanders helped to bring it to the beach and we began to wonder where it had come from,\u201d Doolin Ferry said.\n\nIt turns out the boat is a U.S. Navy High Speed Maneuverable Surface Target (HSMST) whose former home was about 3,300 miles away in Norfolk, Va.\n\nIRISH PRIEST BLASTS CHURCHGOERS FOR BRINGING CIGARETTES, BEER AS FUNERAL GIFTS\n\n\u201cThis boat was built in 2015 and it\u2019s likely that it was lost during a training exercise, and it remained in the water drifting until it ended up in the water close to Inis Oirr and was discovered by the crew of the Doolin Express,\u201d the company said.\n\nPhotos of the mystery boat quickly went viral after they were posted online by the Doolin Ferry Co.

Would love to know its story,\" one person said.\n\nNaval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division spokesman Timothy Boulay told The Virginian-Pilot this week that the vessel was lost at sea in September 2018 during a missile test and evaluation exercise approximately 75 miles off the coast of Norfolk, home to Norfolk Naval Station. The Atlantic Target and Maritime Operations team searched the HSMST for five hours to no avail and later notified the Coast Guard of the potential navigation hazard, Boulay said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoulay said it wasn\u2019t surprising the boat made it across the Atlantic, since the vessel is filled with foam so that it won\u2019t sink.\n\n\u201cOur people are not surprised it made it to Ireland,\u201d he said.", "description": "A U.S. Navy boat that was last seen a year ago was discovered by a ferry crew off the coast of Ireland this week.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/69396597_2571128322918625_2406219053505970176_o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
