A short delay might increase pressure on parliament to approve a deal.\n\nThe European Commission took note on Tuesday of the vote in the British parliament and said it would wait for London to tell it what's next.\n\n\"European Council President (Donald Tusk) is consulting leaders on the UK\u2019s request for an extension until 31 January 2020,\" she said. A spokesman for Tusk declined comment.\n\nSenior EU officials said the 27 countries that would remain in the EU after Britain leaves would \"certainly not\" react immediately. \"We stay calm,\" one senior diplomat said.\n\nIrish PM Leo Varadkar welcomed the vote in favor of Johnson's legislation.\n\n\"We will now await further developments from London and Brussels about next steps including timetable for the legislation and the need for an extension,\" Varadkar said.\n\nAhead of the vote, Johnson had warned parliament that if it defeated him on the timetable and forced a delay until January then he would abandon his attempt to ratify the deal and push for an election instead under the slogan of \"Get Brexit Done\".\n\nIn his statement after the votes in parliament, Johnson did not mention an election. Johnson would need the support of parliament to call one.\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called on Johnson to work with other parties to ensure a reasonable timetable to discuss the deal. Some in the Labour Party expect a short extension, with Brexit being resolved and then an election within months.\n\nBehind the daily Brexit combat in parliament, in the courts and at late-night EU summits, a much bigger game is being played over whether Brexit will happen at all.\n\nJohnson faces legislative booby traps at every juncture, but the opponents of Brexit are also deeply divided - one of the reasons their campaign to \"Remain\" failed in the 2016 vote.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday it was up to the EU to decide whether it wanted to delay Brexit and for how long, after a defeat in parliament made ratification of his deal by the Oct 31 deadline almost impossible.
