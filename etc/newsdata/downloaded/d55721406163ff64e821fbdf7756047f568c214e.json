While the public clamors for protection from lesser dangers, technology for preventing child deaths in hot cars exists today - yet it remains years away from widespread implementation.\n\nThat technology is called the backseat reminder. General Motors introduced optional backseat-reminder systems in Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC models in the 2017 model year. Other automakers have followed suit since then. GM\u2019s system detects whether a rear door has been opened prior to a drive. After the car is stopped and the engine is shut down, a chime sounds and a warning message is flashed across the Driver Information Center, advising the driver to check the back seat.\n\nIn a Sept. 4 news release, the Auto Alliance, an industry group focusing on such issues as automotive safety and environmental concerns, stated: \u201cAt a minimum, these prompts will include a combination of auditory and visual alerts that will activate after a driver turns off the vehicle. With this pledge, the auto industry commits to having the rear seat reminder feature in essentially all cars and trucks by Model Year 2025 or sooner.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right, 2025 - eight years after GM judged this technology ready for prime time in modern motor vehicles. And many more years will pass before older cars lacking backseat reminders are taken out of service, or retrofitted.\n\n\u201cAlthough this individual commitment by automakers applies to new vehicles in the future, there are also several cellphone apps available as well as some child car seats that include alarm features,\u201d the Auto Alliance noted in the Sept. 4 news release. Information on such apps and devices is easy to find via the internet. But redundancy, a lifesaving feature of airliners and military aircraft, is worthwhile in backseat-reminder systems as well.\n\nHospitals, pediatricians, retailers who sell car seats and other baby supplies, and organizations catering to young parents should educate themselves on the rear-seat-reminder alternatives available now, display them prominently in stores and on websites, apply vigorous salesmanship to put these products into the hands of new parents, and lobby automakers and politicians for quicker action on built-in automotive warning systems. Meanwhile, automakers should not wait for the U.S. government to force them to install backseat reminders in every model they sell - and the key word should be \u201csooner,\u201d not \u201csix years from now.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/32sRZsD\n\n___\n\nMAINE\n\nMaine\u2019s plan for lobster lines an improvement\n\nPortland Press Herald\n\nOct. 18\n\nA federal proposal to cut fishing lines off the Maine coast was dead in the water to lobstermen, who said it would put either their lives or ability to make a living at risk.\n\nWe agreed, arguing that there was no evidence that the plan, aimed at saving the endangered North Atlantic right whale, would hit its target, though it would certainly cause distress in Maine\u2019s $485 million lobster industry.\n\nThe lobster industry felt the same way. Now the state Department of Marine Resources has put forward its own proposal.\n\nAimed at addressing the risk to right whales \u201cwhere it actually occurs,\u201d according to Commissioner Patrick Keliher, the plan, the state says, meets goals for reducing mortality risk among whales while lessening the burden on the lobster industry. It\u2019s a good counterproposal to the federal government\u2019s plan, and it deserves serious consideration.\n\nThe federal proposal, released this summer, called on Maine to reduce the number of surface-to-seabed buoy lines by 50 percent in both state waters, which run out to three miles from shore, and federal waters, which extend from there.\n\nThe goal was to reduce whale injury and death by 60 percent. Between 2017 and 2018, 20 right whales died - a staggering 4 percent of the population - mostly from entanglements with fishing lines. Experts say even one death a year could doom the population, which has fallen to about 400.\n\nHowever, lobstermen said the plan would cause them to either cut the number of traps, which would hurt operations that rely on volume, or put more traps on each line, adding weight that would put smaller crews at risk.\n\nAnd while fishing entanglements are to blame for about 85 percent of right whale deaths, none of those deaths has been conclusively tied to the Maine lobster industry. The whales are a very rare sight, fishermen say, particularly in the waters closer to shore.\n\nA number of other factors have been floated for the deaths, too, including changes in water temperature that have caused the whales to change feeding grounds, as well as more lax conservation laws in Canadian waters.\n\nWith all this in mind, lobstermen were right to be wary of the proposal. And since industry buy-in is necessary to make any plan work, the state was right to put forward its own proposal.\n\nThe state\u2019s plan would eliminate 25 percent of buoy lines set by state lobstermen in federal waters by requiring they add more traps to each line, \u201ctrawling up\u201d more and more as they get farther from shore, where a right whale is more likely to pass through.\n\nThe plan would affect about 1,800 of Maine\u2019s 5,000 or so licensed lobstermen. Keliher said the state could work with captains of smaller vessels for whom adding too many traps would be dangerous.\n\nKeliher said the department believes the plan meets the federal goal for risk reduction. That remains to be seen; environmental and conservation groups say it doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough.\n\nBut it at least takes into account the impact on the lobster industry and acknowledges that drastic changes in some waters will do more harm that good.\n\nThat\u2019s a step in the right direction, and goes a long way toward getting the lobster industry back on board with the effort to save the right whale.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2BpkzyZ\n\n___\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nTurkey got what it wanted in \u2018cease-fire.\u2019 What did U.S. get?\n\nThe Boston Globe\n\nOct. 18\n\nPresident Trump broke this nation\u2019s policy in Syria and gave the Turkish government free rein to attack our Kurdish allies, but now insists things in that war-torn region are going to be just fine.\n\nOnly the very gullible believe that.\n\nAmerican troops had been holding together a fragile stalemate in Syria, combating the Islamic State with the help of the Kurds while also deterring Turkey from invading. That all fell apart in spectacular fashion when Trump withdrew U.S. troops so abruptly that the Pentagon\u2019s been bombing its own bases in Syria to prevent them from falling into the hands of other forces. Given the green light by the president, Turkey immediately invaded and got to work slaughtering the Kurds, who had placed their trust in the United States.\n\nAfter a five-hour negotiation with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Vice President Pence announced the start of a five-day \u201cpause\u201d in the fighting along the Syrian border that could lead to a permanent cease-fire. In doing so, the United States gave Turkey pretty much everything it wanted - a 20-mile \u201csafe zone\u201d along its border with Syria, the eventual lifting of sanctions against some of its top officials and businessmen, and the promise of \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d to rebuild communities within Syria.\n\nAnd what \u201cconcessions\u201d did the United States get, reporters repeatedly asked Pence - that is, apart from the opportunity to save face both with the international community and with members of the president\u2019s own party who have not been shy about expressing how appalled they are at this administration\u2019s foreign policy blunders? Evangelical Christian leaders have been particularly vocal about the danger the precipitous withdrawal of American troops and the subsequent Turkish attacks have posed to minority religious communities that had been protected by the Kurds.\n\n\u201cFirst this ends the violence,\u201d Pence assured. \u201cGreat news out of Turkey,\u201d Trump posted on Twitter. \u201cMillions of lives will be saved!\u201d he added, ignoring that it was his policy blunder that put those lives at risk in the first place.\n\nBut then, for Trump, this whole episode is \u201c7,000 miles away,\u201d and if Russians are now occupying territory once held by US troops, well, \u201cThey got a lot of sand over there. So, there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d As for the Kurds, Trump insisted, \u201cThe Kurds are very well protected. Plus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they\u2019re no angels.\u201d\n\nYes, that\u2019s what passes for U.S. foreign policy these days.\n\nOf course, cease-fires are always subject to interpretation. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said: \u201cThis is not a cease-fire\u2026. We will pause the operation for 120 hours in order for the terrorists to leave.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cterrorists,\u201d he\u2019s referring to Kurdish fighters linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, which has launched attacks on Turkish soil. And he said that 20-mile deep \u201csafe zone\u201d would stretch more than 280 miles from the northern city of Manbij to the Syrian border with Iraq.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Syrian Kurds gave up land and were promised a cease-fire in return. An effort earlier this year was brokered by the United States and then quickly violated by Turkey. But then American troops were on the ground to halt that invasion. Now they are not.\n\nSo, Thursday the Trump administration got its headline - and perhaps that will be enough to appease some discontented Republicans of the deluded variety. Good for U.S. Senator Mitt Romney for avoiding that trap. He took to the floor of the Senate yesterday to denounce the deal with Turkey for what it was - a sham.\n\n\u201cThe announcement today is being portrayed as a victory. It is far from a victory,\u201d Romney said.\n\nErdogan got everything he wanted. Mike Pence got a photo-op. The Kurds remain in harm\u2019s way. And US policy in Syria remains a national disgrace.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2BlxQZo\n\n___\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nState can do a lot more with RGGI money\n\nConcord Monitor\n\nOct. 17\n\nLawmakers need to try yet again to restore some sense to the spending of New Hampshire\u2019s share of the revenue earned by making electric utilities pay a price for pollution.\n\nIn 2008, New Hampshire joined with seven other states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by creating the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Operating as a cooperative, RGGI caps the amount of carbon dioxide that the region\u2019s power plants can emit and holds auctions to sell utilities what are essentially permits to pollute. At the last auction the cost of a credit to emit one ton of CO2 went for $5.20.\n\nTo be truly effective at combating climate change, the credit should be 10 or 15 times higher and should apply to the transportation sector as well. Nonetheless, the auctions raise a lot of money. Earlier this month the cooperative issued a state-by-state report on how that money was spent in 2017. New Hampshire wasted most of its share.\n\nWe understand that some will disagree with that characterization, but while every other state in the compact used all or nearly all of its revenue from the auctions to fund energy-efficiency programs New Hampshire did not. The state, the RGGI report said, received $11.1 million from the 2017 auctions. It put $3 million in the state\u2019s energy efficiency fund to pay for conservation measures like insulating municipal buildings and low-income homes. It gave $7.8 million back to utility customers in the form of \u201cdirect bill assistance.\u201d\n\nThat assistance doesn\u2019t, as far as we could find, show up on customers\u2019 monthly bills. It amounts to pennies per month. Pretty much no one knows that they received the money so it does nothing to alter behavior by say, replacing incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. Direct bill assistance using RGGI money, save for programs to assist low-income customers, should be scrapped.\n\nRGGI was designed to combat climate change on two fronts. Charge utilities to pollute and they\u2019ll be more likely to invest to limit their emissions. Spend the money raised on energy efficiency. That reduces the amount of electricity that needs to be generated and greenhouse gas emissions. It was a two-fer, but in 2012, with Republican ideologues and Tea Party zealots in control of the Legislature, a move to force the state to leave RGGI looked like it could succeed.\n\nIn a compromise to keep New Hampshire in the compact, lawmakers agreed that only the first $1 of the auction price would go to conservation; the rest had to be returned to customers.\n\nTwo more states, Pennsylvania and Virginia, appear likely to join the compact and New Jersey, which dropped out when Chris Christie was governor, is poised to rejoin. Those states should not make New Hampshire\u2019s mistake.\n\nGov. Sununu vetoed last session\u2019s attempt to direct more RGGI money to energy-efficiency programs. He twanged the old saw and said \u201cwhat about the retired woman teacher living on a fixed income in Manchester. She can use the rebate.\u201d Maybe, but what that teacher and many others could really use is help from a program that insulates their drafty home or helps them replace an old energy hog of a refrigerator.\n\nThat kind of RGGI fund spending saves hundreds of dollars per year, not pennies.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2Brn0Bk\n\n___\n\nRHODE ISLAND\n\nPoor process for impeachment\n\nThe Providence Journal\n\nOct. 17\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Trump has broken so dramatically with precedent that some wonder whether it constitutes an impeachment effort at all.\n\nIn the past, such proceedings - against Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton - were treated with solemnity and regard for the American people of both parties.\n\nThey were initiated by a vote of the full House of Representatives, recognizing that, under the Constitution, the House impeaches, not just the political faction in control. Since overruling the votes of the people for president is wrenching and divisive, it was always regarded as a very big deal.\n\nAs the Judiciary Committee noted in its Oct. 7, 1998 report to the House regarding the impeachment of President Clinton, after an independent counsel found he had committed perjury and obstructed justice: \u201cBecause the issue of impeachment is of such overwhelming importance, the Committee decided that it must receive the authorization from the full House before proceeding on any further course of action. Because impeachment is delegated solely to the House of Representatives by the Constitution, the full House of Representatives should be involved in critical decision making regarding various stages of impeachment.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the committee made clear that the president had rights in that process: \u201cThe President and his counsel shall be invited to attend all executive session and open committee hearings. The President\u2019s counsel may cross examine witnesses. The President\u2019s counsel may make objections regarding the pertinency of evidence. The President\u2019s counsel shall be invited to suggest that the Committee receive additional evidence. Lastly, the President or the President\u2019s counsel shall be invited to respond to the evidence adduced by the Committee at an appropriate time. The provisions will ensure that the impeachment inquiry is fair to the President.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, members of the president\u2019s party had power to issue subpoenas for witnesses.\n\nDue process, including the right to a defense and to confront one\u2019s accusers, is the very essence of American justice.\n\nThe process under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been radically different. She has refused to hold a vote. A committee is holding secret meetings in the basement of the Capitol, bringing in witnesses selected only by Democrats. Neither the American people nor the president\u2019s counsel is permitted to attend. Selective leaks are being issued. In some ways, the process has more the air of a Soviet procedure than an American one.\n\nWe endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and find President Trump odious and his behavior unfit for his high office. But, in opposing him, it is important that we not dispense with American ideals or undermine our republic. (For similar reasons, we oppose junking the Electoral College or packing the Supreme Court.) We will need our republic after Mr. Trump is gone, which could be very soon, after an election in less than 13 months. We don\u2019t want one-sided tactics used against future presidents to overturn the will of voters.\n\nWhile the daily drumbeat of impeachment in the news may be driving down Mr. Trump\u2019s poll numbers - polls differ - it remains unlikely a Republican Senate will provide the two-thirds vote to remove him from office. We fear that this process will end up solidifying support for Mr. Trump in his base while turning off moderate voters, weakening rather than strengthening Democratic prospects in 2020.\n\nBut if the House must impeach, it should follow established precedent.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/33KDYXt\n\n___\n\nVERMONT\n\nAll of us\n\nTimes Argus\n\nOct. 12\n\nOnce again, headlines from across Vermont have highlighted recent overdoses as a result of the opioid crisis. In a few cases, the individual\u2019s addiction has become a signal to others.\n\nAn obituary for Megan Angelina Webbley, 31, was heartbreaking.\n\nIt stated, in part, \u201cshe died of an overdose, finally losing her battle with addiction. She was in Manchester, N.H., seeking treatment for her addiction.\u201d\n\nWebbley was the mother of four \u201cwho were collectively the light of her dark life,\u201d her family wrote. The obituary details an accident in 2005 - a singular moment - that is believed to be the beginning of the final chapter of Webbley\u2019s troubled life: the beginning of an addiction to pain killers. \u201cShe would be in and out of rehab - and jail - for the next 14 years.\u201d She would also lose her children.\n\nIn the obituary, her family pleaded: \u201cWe, as a state, are overwhelmed by addiction. We have almost nowhere to turn. I encourage enhanced funding for treatment in general and using DCF as a gateway for mothers with addiction to get help. Because, as one would guess, once the mother is separated from her children, desperation sets in, even with the brightest and most determined of mothers - and Megan Angelina Webbley was that bright and determined mother. with a fatal disease and a dearth of treatment options.\u201d\n\nWe all know people affected by this plague. We all know about the hub-and-spoke approach to treatment. And we all know how sinister addiction can be to a relationship, a family, a neighborhood, a community and a state.\n\nWe live it every day.\n\nSo it is a relief when precautionary steps are taken - at any level.\n\nThis week, U.S. health officials again warned doctors against abandoning chronic-pain patients by abruptly stopping their opioid prescriptions.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services instead urged doctors to share such decisions with patients. The agency published steps for doctors in a six-page guide and an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nAccording to that editorial, prescription opioid use continues to contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. In 2017, 17,029 of the 47,600 opioid-related overdose deaths involved prescription opioids. Nearly 2 million individuals in the United States have a prescription-opioid use disorder. At the same time, approximately 11% of U.S. adults report daily pain, and an estimated 3% to 4% use opioids long-term to help manage chronic pain.\n\nIn the 1990s, overprescribing started the first wave of the nation\u2019s overdose crisis. Opioids - previously used mostly for patients with cancer, at the end of their lives or with pain after surgery - began to be prescribed for long-term pain such as backaches. Drug companies promoted that use, even as evidence grew of addiction and overdose.\n\nLater, insurers and hospitals misinterpreted cautions about opioids in ways that harmed some patients. Some turned to street drugs such as heroin or fentanyl after doctors stopped prescribing.\n\nIn April, the Food and Drug Administration added new label advice to drugs such as OxyContin, Vicodin and dozens of generic pills after reports of suicide and other serious harm in patients who were physically dependent on opioids suddenly having the medicine stopped or their dose rapidly decreased.\n\nIn the new guide, health officials said slow, voluntary reductions of opioid doses can improve quality of life without worsening pain. Tapering the drugs slowly can take months or years.\n\nThe editorial notes: \u201cWhile safe and effective opioid use and discontinuation can be challenging, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline and the HHS guide emphasize that clinicians have a responsibility to provide care for or arrange for management of patients\u2019 pain and should not abandon patients. . More research is critically needed to define optimal strategies for opioid tapering. . Unless there is a life-threatening issue, such as imminent overdose, the benefits of rapidly tapering or abruptly discontinuing opioids are unlikely to outweigh the significant risks of these practices. However, following slow, voluntary reduction of long-term opioid dosages, most patients report improvements in function, quality of life, anxiety, and mood without worsening pain or with decreased pain levels.\u201d\n\nThat is no consolation to the family of Megan Angelina Webbley. But because of steps being taken by the medical profession, and the courageousness of families who stand up to remind us that these addicts are our family members, friends and neighbors, we are staring down this plague with the indignation it deserves.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/32xs4Qo\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Editorials from around New England:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
