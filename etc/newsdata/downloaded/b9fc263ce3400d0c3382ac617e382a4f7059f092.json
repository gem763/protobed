Giuliani on Wednesday said he has been read a transcript of a July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that has helped prod House Democrats to formally open an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen you read the conversation, there\u2019s \u2026 no mention of military aid. There\u2019s no quid pro quo,\u201d Mr. Giuliani, who has been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s say, it was read to me.\u201d\n\nAsked if the whole thing was read to him, Mr. Giuliani said: \u201cI hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the president hadn\u2019t discussed the subjects he discussed with the president of the Ukraine, he\u2019d be a president like Obama who closed his eyes to corruption,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if the president brought up former Vice President Joseph R. Biden on the call, Mr. Giuliani said: \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t bring it up. Could be possible the president of Ukraine brought it up.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden is the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Trump said he would release a transcript of the July 25 phone call on Wednesday. The call is reportedly part of a whistleblower complaint tied to Mr. Trump potentially threatening to withhold military aid from the country unless Mr. Zelensky agreed to investigate the Ukrainian business interests of Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden\u2019s son.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
