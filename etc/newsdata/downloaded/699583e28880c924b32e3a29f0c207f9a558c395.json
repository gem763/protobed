But they saw the funny side.\n\nLet\u2019s hope it wasn\u2019t too cold (Picture: Chandler Lefever)\n\nCollin soon shared the picture on Twitter where it immediately went viral, racking up almost 500,000 likes.\n\n\u2018So me and Alyssa took our engagement pictures yesterday,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018She found a Pinterest picture that she wanted to try and recreate\u2026I botched it.\u2019\n\nIn their version of the pics, the fizz got all over Alyssa and photographer Chandler managed to snap her at the exact moment.\n\nHe knew he struck gold as far as funny engagement pictures go but didn\u2019t want to reveal it to the couple till he edited it.\n\nOnce they did see it, they were thoroughly entertained.\n\nCome on Collin, her mouth is right there (Picture: Chandler Lefever)\n\nCollin told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We love our version! It just shows who we really are! We\u2019re always having fun and joking around and it was cool that it got captured.\n\n\u2018Neither of us ever got annoyed or upset\u2026 thankfully. We just laughed it off and embraced the fact that nothing is ever going to be perfect!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuckily, Alyssa had a second outfit at the ready so they were able to get those stunning shots in the end.\n\nBut little did she know that the inspo couple she found on Pinterest also had a tough time getting that perfect shot.\n\nPhotographer Brianna tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018Our champagne shot wasn\u2019t totally planned! Alex and Tammy (clients) brought a bottle and popped it open to drink on the blanket during the shoot.\n\nEven the inspo couple ended up spilling some (Picture: Brianna Bender)\n\n\u2018It was kind of a spur of the moment, I yelled at Alex to pour some in her mouth. He made sure to pour nice and slow but did actually end up spilling some on Tammy.\u2019\n\nClearly champagne photoshoots are no picnic.\n\nMORE: Swimmer photombombs couple\u2019s first picture as man and wife during private wedding ceremony\n\nMORE: Curious raccoons interrupt couple\u2019s wedding photoshoot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Alyssa Snodsmith, and Collin Hewett, who met while studying at university in Chicago, Illinois decided to celebrate their engagement.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pinterest_1571897877.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
