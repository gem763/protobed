The crossfire between US President Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg on Twitter last month captured the acrimony in miniature.\n\nSuch is the surface tension that we miss what unites the two sides. At the core of both movements is a mistrust of capitalism. For the populist, it undermines nationhood. For the green, it imperils all life.\n\nTheir lines of approach are different, but both converge on a position that is recognisably Malthusian. Populists assume that immigrants leave less of the (presumably fixed) national wealth for native-born citizens. The greenest greens equate economic and even demographic growth with the depletion of the planet.\n\nThere is a measure of hokum in each claim. But it is compatible hokum. Given time, the intellectual overlap might be the stuff of a political coalition.\n\nWe are said to have lived through a realignment in recent years, from left versus right to former UK prime minister Tony Blair\u2019s glib but yet-to-be-bettered \u201copen versus closed\u201d. The sorting process is incomplete, though. Like citizens of a hastily partitioned country, there are people stranded on the wrong side of the new line.\n\nCorporate Republicans swallow their qualms about Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs for the sake of tax cuts. The Grand Old Party is still a union of the most pro-market people in America and the most nostalgic authoritarians.\n\nThis is not \u2014 if Ms Thunberg will excuse the phrase \u2014 sustainable. Time is likely to bring about a more coherent delineation, between those who are at ease with modernity and those who would like to unwind it some. If so, populists and environmentalists could find themselves on the same side.\n\nIn France, some of the gilets jaunes, who once howled at fuel taxes, are marching with greens. In Britain, there is a fad for agricultural autarky among your dig-for-victory kind of Brexiter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is natural to see this romantic conservatism as an Old World thing. But it has been a part of American thought since Thomas Jefferson envisioned an agrarian republic. Woodrow Wilson, no less than Nixon, paired backward social views with an environmental conscience.\n\nNot a lot of environmentalists at this Trump rally. But populists and greens are both suspicious of the establishment. AP\n\nThe diaries of George Kennan, the great diplomat, and a conservative if not a Republican, teem with grumbles about minorities and modern women \u2014 but also about the motor car and the despoliation of nature. To equate American conservatism with the free market is to fall foul of recency bias. The movement predates Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cThere is more to life than economic growth.\u201d What stands out about this line, beyond its smarminess, is that it could come from a traditionalist as easily as from a young green.\n\nBecause these tribes are so outwardly different, their collaboration seems fanciful. But then electoral coalitions are often jarring. Segregationist Southerners helped to vote through the New Deal. The GOP has long reconciled rich capitalists and workers who hate trade.\n\nIf anything, an alliance of greens and populists would be more coherent, at least in substance, and perhaps even in style. Both spit the word \u201cliberal\u201d (or \u201cneoliberal\u201d) as slander. Both have what we might delicately call an extra-parliamentary wing.\n\nNo one is suggesting eyeball-to-eyeball teamwork here. Mr Trump rallies and Extinction Rebellion marches will never blend. But each side can vote against the market without having much to do with the other.\n\nWhat they lack in fellow-feeling they can make up for in decisive numbers. janan.ganesh@ft.com\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "On the face of it, populists and environmentalists are the two least reconcilable movements in world politics.
