(The price includes entrancne to Sugarloaf Mountain, although transport is not included).\n\n(Image: Booking.com)\n\nDon't be disheartened if you don't manage to bag one of the stays. You can still go and ride the cable cars during the day time - or head to other hotspots such as Christ the Redeemer or Ipanema beach, both of which are great vantage points from which to view the mountain.\n\nBooking.com is offering the experience after the brand's research into travel trends for 2020 revealed that there's set to be a rise in travellers visiting destinations that offer an array of enriching experiences.", "description": "Rio de Janeiro's Sugarloaf Mountain cable cars are opening for overnight stays and guests will get some pretty spectacular views", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Booking.Com", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585252.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sugarloaf-cable-cars.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
