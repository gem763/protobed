The provision is meant to prevent government officials from receiving benefits and gifts from foreign interests.\n\nJosh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, anticipates the Justice Department will ask the full 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider the panel\u2019s move to allow the case to proceed, but he noted that could drag on for months.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect this case will reach the Supreme Court until closer to the 2020 election,\u201d he told The Washington Times.\n\nThe plaintiffs have argued they\u2019re financially harmed when foreign and domestic government officials go to the Trump-owned establishments instead of their own places of business. One restaurant, Amali in New York, said it has had a noticeable decline in government business since the 2016 election, resulting in lost wages, tips and profits, according to court documents.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to force the president to divest himself from the Trump Organization.\n\n\u201cThe complaint sufficiently alleges that plaintiffs compete directly with Trump establishments and that the president\u2019s allegedly illegal acts favor plaintiffs\u2019 competitors,\u201d Judge Pierre N. Leval, a Clinton appointee, wrote for the appeals court.\n\nThe 2-1 decision doesn\u2019t decide whether the president violated the Establishment Clause, but it revives the legal conflict, allowing the plaintiffs to proceed in the district court.\n\nJudge John M. Walker Jr., a George H.W. Bush appointee, dissented, saying the case should have been dismissed. He cautioned the courts to avoid the legal battle since it\u2019s highly political.\n\n\u201cThis case is deeply political and thus finds itself in an area where federal courts ought to tread lightly,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cPresident Trump was democratically elected by the American people \u2014 and he was elected with his business holdings and brand prominence in full view.\u201d\n\nThe 2nd Circuit\u2019s decision conflicts with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed a similar lawsuit brought by attorneys general in a Maryland court in July. Last month, they filed a new petition, asking the full 4th Circuit to rehear the case.\n\nThe 4th Circuit, in its ruling, questioned why the lawsuit was brought in the first place, suggesting political motives moved the case beyond a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nJudge Leval shot back at the dissent and the 4th Circuit\u2019s ruling, which are substantially the same, saying those opinions focus on the lawsuit being \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it is certainly possible that these lawsuits are fueled in part by political motivations, we do not understand the significance of that fact,\u201d Judge Leval wrote. \u201cWhether a lawsuit has political motivations is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nA split among circuit courts typically gives a petition for a Supreme Court review a \u201cmuch better than average chance of success\u201d for being granted, according to Ilya Shapiro, who publishes the Cato Institute\u2019s Supreme Court Review.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the court may not want to insert itself into such a politicized case,\u201d he added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
