Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) strategist Rukayat Yusuf said in a Sept. 9 research note she expected the government to issue at least $2.6 billion in Eurobonds in the last quarter of the year.\n\nOniha said the government will stick to its new domestic borrowing plan to raise 802.8 billion naira in 2019. It had proposed the same amount for external borrowing in 2019, which at the official exchange rate of 305 naira per dollar is equivalent to $2.6 billion, according to the finance ministry.", "description": "Nigeria Will Stay Clear of International Debt Markets in 2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picd6411445ef8bf35c07b28b7a54d5ed50.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
