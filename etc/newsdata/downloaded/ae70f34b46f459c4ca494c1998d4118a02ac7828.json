In that time, he has collected hundreds of law enforcement badges and arm patches. (Theresa Vargas/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nAsk Jack Guercio to show you his three favorite pieces in his vast collection of law enforcement badges and patches, and he won\u2019t hesitate. He will promptly point to three.\n\nThen four.\n\nThen five.\n\nThen six.\n\n\u201cThose two over there,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that one. And all of these.\u201d\n\nThe 77-year-old has collected hundreds, and on this morning, many cover a table in front of him. There\u2019s a gold badge from the Maryland Capitol Police and a star-shaped one from the Baltimore County Sheriff\u2019s Office. There are patches from Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Rome.\n\nThat last one has a Velcro back. That matters because it explains how Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler got it directly from an Italian officer, who pulled it off his uniform, to give to Jack.\n\nThe simplest way to describe Jack\u2019s position at the sheriff\u2019s office is sewn onto his work shirt: custodian.\n\nBut that title falls short of capturing the role he has played in the 27-plus years he has worked for the agency, and what his place there says about the benefits of employing people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. That title doesn\u2019t explain why deputies, background investigators and even the sheriff can\u2019t go on vacation without thinking about him.\n\n\u201cJack is our spirit,\u201d Gahler says. \u201cHe loves this place. He loves the men and women who work here.\u201d\n\nRight after Gahler was sworn in as sheriff, the first phone call he received came from someone who wanted to know if the rumor was true. That person had heard Gahler was not going to keep Jack.\n\nThat was five years ago. Since then, Jack went from having a desk in a hallway to his own space in an office.\n\n\u201cJack will be here long after me, and I plan to stay awhile, \u201cGahler says. \u201cSheriffs come and go. Jack is the one constant.\u201d\n\nBefore I met Jack, when I first heard about him and his collection, my thoughts immediately went to another Maryland man with an intellectual and developmental disability. He also loved law enforcement, but his experience with a Maryland sheriff\u2019s office differed dramatically from Jack\u2019s.\n\nEthan Saylor, who had Down syndrome, used to dress up in a suit and sunglasses to play detective as a child. As an adult, he collected badges and baseball caps that read, \u201cPolice,\u201d \u201cDEA\u201d and \u201cSheriff.\u201d He also developed a habit of dialing 911 to talk to operators when there was no emergency. Sometimes he would call just to ask for a job application.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2013, the 26-year-old died after three off-duty Frederick County sheriff\u2019s deputies forcibly removed him from a movie theater. His crime: He hadn\u2019t bought a ticket for a second showing of a movie he had just watched with an aide. During the struggle, he ended up on the ground and suffered a fractured larynx. His death was later ruled a homicide as a result of asphyxia.\n\nAs a reporter, I covered his death and the lawsuit that followed. I also wrote about how his family worked with Maryland to change how law enforcement officials are taught to interact with people with disabilities. They now receive training in the academy, and the state has made a commitment to include people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in that training.\n\n[A man with Down syndrome pretended to be robbed \u2014 to help the police]\n\nIn other words, the state now understands what all states should: The best way to help first responders know what to do when they encounter someone with a disability is to expose them to people with disabilities.\n\nShawn Kros, who heads the Arc Northern Chesapeake Region, points to Jack\u2019s position at the sheriff\u2019s office as an example of why more places should hire people with disabilities. The organization, which provides support to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, has provided Jack services since he was in his early 20s.\n\n\u201cJack does his job, but he brings more to that department than just cleaning the building,\u201d Kros says. As for Jack: \u201cHe would be lost without that job.\u201d\n\nKros says the moment she knew that Jack was genuinely a part of the sheriff\u2019s office came in 2016. Deputies Mark Logsdon and Patrick Dailey were killed in a shooting, and she saw how during the services people in the sheriff\u2019s office pulled Jack into their fold.\n\n\u201cThis is the way it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nJack places flowers at a memorial for Harford County Sheriff\u2019s Deputies Mark Logsdon and Patrick Dailey in 2016. (Harford County Sheriff\u2019s Office)\n\nBefore he started working for the sheriff\u2019s office, Jack says he held several jobs. He washed dishes in a kitchen, lugged logs for a fencing company and worked in a hot warehouse, placing labels on glass jars.\n\nAs a child, he says, he always pretended he was the sheriff. Other children had to play the bad guys. One day in his teens or early 20s, he was in a car that drove past the sheriff\u2019s office in Bel Air, and Jack recalls saying, \u201cI want to work here one day.\u201d\n\nWhen Jack talks about his years with the agency, he does so with encyclopedic precision. A conversation with him can feel as if you\u2019re clicking links along the way. He will start telling a story about an event, mention someone\u2019s name and then start describing the layout of the old building so that you know precisely where that person\u2019s office was located.\n\nWhen Amy Schaekel came from the Baltimore City police department to work at the sheriff\u2019s office as a background investigator, she soon heard about Jack.\n\n\u201cEveryone was like, \u2018You got to meet Jack,\u2019 \u201d she recalls. \u201cHe called me \u2018that girl\u2019 for a little while. Then I got Jack a badge. Once I gave him that, I was no longer \u2018that girl.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe now calls her his sister, and he spends Thanksgiving and Easter with her family. Her children call him \u201cUncle Jack.\u201d\n\nJack says he bought his first badge from a \u201cfive and dime.\u201d Others have come from flea markets. Many were given to him as gifts. He hopes to eventually get an NYPD badge and patch, and he would love if he could ultimately have every state represented in his collection.\n\nThe morning that he tries to pick his favorites, he focuses only on the table, so Schaekel reminds him of one that is not there. Around his neck hangs a badge that says, \u201cHarford County Sheriff\u2019s Office,\u201d along with \u201cJack.\u201d\n\nGahler presented it to him as a birthday present at a gathering in the break room. The sheriff recalls it being only the second time he saw Gahler express strong emotions. The first time was after the deputies died.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s come off since,\u201d Schaekel says.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jack tells her. \u201cThe only time it comes off is when I\u2019m sleeping.\u201d\n\nFinally, he\u2019s found his favorite.", "description": "Jack Guercio has worked for more than 27 years at the Harford County Sheriff\u2019s Office.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities.", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MVXpjQlyvAgEGChYaxeIIGvynZU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q5HVXEHGDMI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
