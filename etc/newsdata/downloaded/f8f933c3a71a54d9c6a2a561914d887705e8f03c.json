He said 'you've won the Ballon d'Or, I wanted to tell you before the game'.\n\n\"I was delighted, of course, but I was just zoned in at the time for the game.\n\n\"It was only until later on he actually said 'you've don't realise what you've won here, do you?'. I said 'Gaffer I'm proud, honestly I'm pleased', and he said 'no, you don't realise what an achievement this is!'.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"And to be honest he was dead right, I didn't. I picked up the trophy in front of the fans at Anfield and I almost couldn't wait to give it them back.\n\n\"It was just that type of attitude at the time. Of course I'm a bit older and wiser now, and it does take pride of place at home.\"\n\nLiverpool had has a momentous season which saw them win the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup, and followed that up with the Super Cup at the start of the following campaign.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nHe also netted a hat-trick in England's 5-1 demolition of rivals Germany.\n\nOwen finished ahead of Real Madrid's Spanish striker Raul and Bayern Munich and Germany goalkeeper Olivier Kahn to claim the award, as well as pipping a host of other names in the top 10.\n\nThierry Henry, David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane were also in contention, and Owen quipped: \"Well, you never get a bad Ballon d'Or line up do you?\n\n\"It's always going to be a star-studded list of players.\n\n\"I've got the list saved on my phone as a picture just for when I get a bit down, sometimes you can just have a look at that and that was a year when I beat all those players.\n\n\"It was a special year, special season, particularly at club level but of course at international level as well. It was amazing, goals flowed.\"", "description": "The former Liverpool forward won the prize in 2001 after helping his club earn a unique treble success", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Liverpool Echo", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645628.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MICHAEL-OWEN-LIVERPOOL-V-DERBY-COUNTY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
