He does this every year.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cbut he probably knows it\u2019s an important day,\u201d and I jokingly held up a birthday card from my parents.

Peel is another predictable disappointment for women like me who grew up with one foot in the 20th century.\n\nAt 16, I didn\u2019t want to know about Peel\u2019s history with underage girls, but it was something he openly discussed in 1989, noting that \u201cgirls used to queue up outside [...] I remember one of my regular customers, as it were, turned out to be 13, though she looked older.\u201d Early in his career, Peel married 16-year-old Shirley Anne Milburn, later claiming her parents had lied about her age.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It ended with a \u201ctraumatic\u201d abortion and Nevin says that Peel \u201cmust have known that I was still at school. But he didn\u2019t ask, and I didn\u2019t tell him\u201d.\n\nDespite these revelations, the broadcaster remains something of a revered saint, with many celebrating what would have been his 80th birthday last month.\n\nI can appreciate the sentimentality. For me, he was one of many balding, bearded men I canonised as a child because he bore a passing resemblance to my late father \u2013 a man who, unlike Peel, bought his music from petrol stations along the A12.\n\nI grew up with an older Peel \u2013 the voice of Home Truths, wearing his dad-shorts to Glastonbury. An ageing hippy who made new music a little less intimidating, especially to a kid whose first album was The Best of Enya.\n\nAny stories that didn\u2019t gel with this cosy image were pushed to the back of my teenage mind. The same place where I would try to shelve any allegations against David Bowie or Iggy Pop\u2019s ode to \u201cdating\u201d a 13-year-old. I wasn\u2019t ready to let go of my musical father figures or figure out where I stood in a scene that wouldn\u2019t exist without teenage girls, but still managed to leave them behind as collateral damage.\n\nLike many Peel fans, I stopped sticking my head in the sand when a flood of allegations about Radio 1 DJs emerged in the wake of Operation Yewtree. By this time, I was in my 20s and the drip-drip exhaustion of everyday sexism had taken its toll on my patience. Revisiting the critics of Peel that I\u2019d previously dismissed as killjoys made me realise that solidarity with other women was more important than clinging to the past.\n\nWhen I discussed Peel\u2019s history online, it was news to younger followers, while some older men told me to shut up. Their belligerence echoes numerous blog posts defending Peel on the proviso that things were different back then. Something that my mother, a veteran of the 1970s, always responds to with \u201cyes, it was. It was shit\u201d. I struggle to disagree when I look at Peel dressed as a schoolgirl in 1973. It could almost be funny if you\u2019ve never had men catcalling your school uniform.\n\nThe upside of sharing my heartbreak was how many women messaged me to say they\u2019d wrestled with similar feelings whilst growing up with Peel. As they shared their memories it occurred to me that this is exactly what I was missing as a teenager: a place to hear women sharing their side of music history.\n\nMany of the fans I spoke with were left wondering what to do with our memories of \u201ckeeping it Peel\u201d. Do we \u201ccancel\u201d him and chide ourselves for having any good memories?\n\nIn a recent edition of Nick Cave\u2019s newsletter, he discusses what to do when an \u201cunhappy shadow\u201d falls on pop culture. He reminds himself that \u201c[when a song] weaves itself into the fabric of my life, I become its steward, understanding it better than anybody else ever could.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m always going to fondly remember looking up at Peel\u2019s fireworks as an awestruck teenager. The same one who howled when his death was announced the next year.\n\nBut those moments were never really about him: a stranger who I rarely think about these days. They were growing pains. Ones that, long after I grew up, remind me that we don\u2019t need to hold on to our heroes. Just our sense of wonder.", "description": "One winter\u2019s night in 2003 I was marooned at a family friend\u2019s house party alongside similarly awkward teenagers and their parents.
