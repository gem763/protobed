In September 2011, the Bulgarian Football Union was fined a painfully low \u00a334,250 by UEFA after Fabio Capello's players were abused during a Euro 2012 qualifier.\n\nGermany legend Lothar Matthaus was Bulgaria manager at the time and apologised after home supporters berated Ashley Young, Ashley Cole and Theo Walcott with monkey chants.\n\nUEFA's woeful fines continued into the summer of 2012 when the governing body handed Russia and Spain a combined \u00a340,335 penalty for two racist incidents.\n\nRussian fans, who have had several issues with football's administrators over racism in recent years, could be heard making monkey noises at Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie at Euro 2012 while Spain fans abused Italy striker Mario Balotelli.\n\nThe Spanish FA was fined a mere \u00a345,000 due to racist abused aimed at England stars in 2004\n\nMonday was not the first time England have had trouble in Bulgaria with other abuse in 2011\n\nIn December 2012 the Serbian FA was forced to pay a measly \u00a365,000 penalty after England's Under-21s were targeted. Danny Rose was the victim of racial abuse throughout the game and said at the time he had 'two stones hit me in the head when I went for a throw-in'.\n\nOn loan at Sunderland from Tottenham when the incident took place, Rose was also given a red card when he struck the ball in anger because of the abuse at the full-time whistle.\n\nBulgarian fans made Nazi salutes during the game on Monday night in a planned racist onslaught and it is not the first time affiliation to far-right sentiments have made their way into a football stadium.\n\nIn 2015 the Croatian authorities were forced to apologise after a swastika was drawn onto the pitch before a match against Italy. It came with the match already being played behind closed doors as punishment for racist chanting by Croatian fans just months before.\n\nAs a result Croatia were docked one point in qualification for Euro 2016, forced to play two games behind closed doors and fined just over \u00a370,000 by UEFA.\n\nIt seems Europe's governing body has not learned their lesson though. In October 2018 the Romanian FA was handed a derisory \u00a344,500 fine for racist behaviour from fans in their Nations League draw with Serbia. They also had to play a match behind closed doors.\n\nThe Serbian FA was forced to pay a measly \u00a365,000 penalty after Danny Rose was abused\n\nCroatia had to apologise after a swastika was drawn onto the pitch before a match against Italy\n\nMonday was sadly the second time this year that England's players were targeting during a Euro 2020 qualifying win.\n\nMontenegro were ordered by UEFA to play their June 7 qualifier at home to Kosovo in an empty stadium after Rose, Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi were particularly targeted by groups of home fans in Podgorica back in March.\n\nFurther charges, carrying fines amounting to (\u00a317,260), were handed down by the governing body to Montenegro for the setting off of fireworks, throwing objects on to the pitch, crowd disturbances and stairways being blocked.\n\nUEFA's farcical punishments for racist incidents become even more striking when you consider some of the absurd fines they have imposed for less severe crimes.\n\nThey slapped former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner with an \u00a380,000 penalty during Euro 2012 when he pulled down his shorts to show a betting company's logo printed across his pants.\n\nBendtner's punishment came just months after UEFA also bizarrely fined Manchester City \u00a324,740 for a delay in a Europa League tie against Sporting Lisbon after Roberto Mancini's side were late coming out for the restart in the round of 16 clash.\n\nThat decision by UEFA came a week after Portuguese giants Porto were hit with a \u00a316,700 fine after their fans racially abused City players during a European game.\n\nNicklas Bendtner was fined \u00a380,000 in 2012 for having a betting company's logo on his pants\n\nFIFA's decision to fine Cameroon $154,000 in 2004 for playing in a banned kit was ridiculous\n\nChelsea's controversial Champions League elimination to Barcelona in 2009 led to wild scenes on the pitch as Didier Drogba furiously insisted his side should have been awarded a penalty.\n\nDrogba and his team-mates surrounded referee Tom Ovrebo while supporters also threw missiles on to the pitch during the game. The Blues were hit with a fine of \u00a385,000, over double what Bulgaria had to pay for racially abusing England players back in 2011.\n\nThe most striking example though of how bogus football's governing bodies' fine systems are was FIFA's decision to fine Cameroon $154,000 in 2004 for playing in a banned kit.\n\nCameroon wore a one-piece kit during the 2004 African Cup of Nations that was outlawed because the strip did not meet the rules set out in the laws of the game.\n\nFIFA did reach a settlement with kit manufacturers Puma but the episode highlights the worrying lack of concern to stamp out racial abuse.\n\nBulgaria are yet to meet their fate for the despicable actions of some fans on Monday night but, if history is anything to go by, the punishment will probably not be strong enough to prevent them from doing it again.", "description": "Sanctions for Bulgaria from UEFA seem sure to follow after Monday night but the severity remains to be seen with the body's punishments for racial abuse leaving a lot to be desired in recent years.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/19740186-0-image-a-43_1571143122723.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
