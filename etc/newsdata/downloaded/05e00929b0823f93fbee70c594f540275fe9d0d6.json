Jurgen Klopp and his players must hope that is a good omen. It is the only comfort they can take from becoming the first Champions League holders to open the defence of their crown with a defeat since Milan in 1994. Liverpool were undone by two late goals - the first, a controversial Dries Mertens penalty after Andy Robertson was judged to have tripped Joe Callejon; the second scored by Fernando Llorente after a rare defensive error by Virgil van Dijk.\n\nLiverpool did not play as badly as they did on the same ground nearly 12 months ago and looked the likelier of the two sides before the late penalty call. It is a disappointing start rather than a disastrous one. The group stage draw was much kinder to them this year, meaning hopes of qualification have not been severely dented. But they leave with nothing, despite coming within nine minutes from a valuable point, and that will hurt.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhat is \u2018clear and obvious\u2019?\n\nSince the introduction of VAR in the Premier League this season, video officials have shown a reluctance to overrule their on-field counterparts, with the interpretation of \u2018clear and obvious\u2019 being strictly applied. As long as it\u2019s not a howler, the decision stands. On Champions League opening night in Naples, that same principle seemed to apply.\n\nRobertson, Klopp and the travelling Liverpool supporters will feel aggrieved about the penalty call which turned the night Napoli's way. It was a borderline decision, at best, with Callejon falling before any minimal contact was made. But the referee's decision stood, and that is the price which football must pay if it wants video technology with minimum interference. Bad calls will be overturned, merely questionable ones will largely stand. The question the sport has to ask itself if whether that is a satisfactory compromise.\n\nAdrian\u2019s saves stop heavier defeat\n\nLiverpool are, in no small part, able to call themselves Champions of Europe because of an instinctive late Alisson save from Napoli\u2019s Arkadiusz Milik at Anfield last December. Nine months later, they could have lost this game by a greater margin if not for the quick reactions of their second-choice goalkeeper Adrian.\n\nNapoli\u2019s Fabio Ruiz came closest to breaking the deadlock of any player in the opening 45 minutes but he was denied twice by Alisson\u2019s understudy. That double save was only bettered after the break. Adrian rose a little early to meet Mertens\u2019 far-post attempt but readjusted to magnificently save one-handed. With goal difference in play, it could yet be an important moment in Group E.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

After the breakdown of a Napoli corner, Sadio Man\u00e9 countered at speed with Mohamed Salah in support. A square pass would have put Salah one-on-one but it was too slow to arrive. When Man\u00e9 eventually released the ball, he overhit it.\n\nWere the events of Turf Moor a few weeks ago on Man\u00e9\u2019s mind? It was, more likely, just an example of a player being caught between two stools and failing to make the right decision quick enough. But any sign of reluctance to pass to Salah on Man\u00e9\u2019s part was always going to come under the microscope, and that chance will be pored over in the aftermath of this defeat.\n\nImperious Fabinho marshals the middle\n\nIt is worth remembering that when Liverpool set out on the road to Madrid this time last year, Fabinho could barely get a minute. In fact, his debut was a 60-second cameo in the 3-2 win over Paris Saint-Germain at Anfield. In the time since, he has not only established himself as an integral part of Klopp\u2019s set-up but one of Europe\u2019s leading holding midfielders.\n\nThe control he exerted over this contest, most noticeably in the first half, is why Liverpool can be confident of leaving any ground on the continent with a positive result. There was one memorable moment in particular, in the 35th minute and when in some trouble out on the left, he chested and flicked it the ball around two Napoli players to relieve pressure. He is quickly becoming one of Klopp\u2019s most dependable performers.", "description": "Klopp\u2019s side bruised in Naples again Another European campaign, another defeat in Naples.
