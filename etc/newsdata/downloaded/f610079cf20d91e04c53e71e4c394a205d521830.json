At the time, Motherboard found that the only hint was that a connected iPod produced a pop-up asking the user to verify they trusted this computer, a par for the course prompt that could easily be overlooked.\n\nNow, Motherboard reported, MG says that he has verified the cables can be made in a factory setting, setting the stage for the devices to be mass-produced. In fact, security company Hak5 already has a page set up to order the cables when they hit the market, billing it as the \u201cresult of months of work that has resulted in a highly covert malicious USB cable.\u201d\n\nI will be dropping #OMGCables over the next few days of defcon. I will also have 5g bags of DemonSeed, if that\u2019s your thing. I\u2019ve been very busy with @d3d0c3d & @clevernyyyy.

I can\u2019t wait to get these up on https://t.co/mVYIMD3v7g Now time for a fully destructive teardown to make sure they meet all my requirements for a fully field-ready piece of attack hardware. pic.twitter.com/lMVBv5RRjw \u2014 _MG_ (@_MG_) September 29, 2019\n\nThe Hak5 page claims numerous features for red teams (researchers and security experts who perform penetration testing on secure systems), including the ability to \u201cforensically erase\u201d its firmware, reverting it back to a mundane Lighting cable:\n\nThe O.MG Cable allows new payloads to be created, saved, and transmitted entirely remotely. The cable is built with Red Teams in mind with features like additional boot payloads, no USB enumeration until payload execution, and the ability to forensically erase the firmware, which causes the cable to fall entirely back to an innocuous state. And these are just the features that have been revealed so far.\n\nOn their website, MG says the mass-produced cables will run for around $150.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve completely torn the cable apart to make sure there aren\u2019t any production stoppers,\u201d MG told Motherboard, adding that \u201cI\u2019m just being super transparent about the process\u201d and mostly \u201ceveryone who manufactures something is going to keep it quiet up until release day when they unveil the entire thing and it\u2019s ready for sale or they at least have a sale date.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first batch of production samples are confidence inspiring,\u201d Hak5's Darren Kitchen told Motherboard. \u201cWe\u2019re balancing a number of factors in getting these mischief gadgets produced \u2014 and I think everyone is going to be excited by the finished products. The production process has been pretty straightforward, given our experience making pentest [penetration testing] implants.\u201d\n\nThe modified cables still need to be programmed and undergo quality assurance, MG told the site. When reached for comment, Apple referred Motherboard to the section of its support page where it \u201crecommends using only accessories that Apple has certified and that come with the MFi badge\u201d \u2014 something that isn\u2019t likely to be helpful for anyone who unknowingly encounters one in the wild.\n\nThis type of security threat is far from new. For example, USB drives with malicious firmware have been a security threat for years.\n\nMG\u2019s prior projects also include similarly rigged MacBook chargers and a USB drive that detonates after uploading malicious code, and the U.S. National Security Agency has made similar devices in the past. The O.MG cable is, however, another reminder that it\u2019s not a good idea for a user to plug anything that\u2019s not verifiably safe into their devices, whether it\u2019s a cable found on the street or an unsolicited gift from someone at a conference.\n\n[Motherboard]", "description": "Dummy Lightning cables that allow an attacker to gain remote control of computers they\u2019re plugged into are slated to hit mass production, per a Wednesday report in Motherboard....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Matt Novak"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/epvpck0i0l8snsxxfvni.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
