You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut on Wednesday the official receiver, in charge of the steelmaker since May, said in a statement: \u201cWhile discussions with Ataer are continuing, discussions with other parties who have expressed continued and renewed interest in acquiring the whole British Steel business will now be possible.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued: \u201cDiligence team members from these parties are expected to visit the company\u2019s sites over the coming days and weeks.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that the rescue deal is in danger of collapsing because some of British Steel\u2019s biggest suppliers are refusing to accept price cuts. Citing people aware of the situation, the FT said Ataer has asked for cost reductions as a condition of any final bid to buy the firm.\n\nSome of British Steel\u2019s contracts were priced at \u201cmultiple\u201d times the going market rates, one person familiar with the company told the FT.\n\nA successful sale would be a relief to the steelmaker\u2019s 5,000 workers, although Ataer has said it may cut a number of jobs at British Steel\u2019s main plant in Scunthorpe, which employs 3,000 people.\n\nThe Unite union called on the government to guarantee its continued support for the steelmaker in order to facilitate the sale.\n\nSteve Turner, assistant general secretary for manufacturing at Unite, said on Wednesday: \u201cThe future of 5,000 direct jobs across the UK and a further 20,000 in the supply chain depend on securing a long-term future for British Steel.\n\n\u201cToday I have written to the business secretary Andrea Leadsom requesting an urgent meeting. It is vital that the government continues to stand behind British Steel until the sale process is finalised.\u201d", "description": "Doubts are emerging over a deal to buy British Steel out of liquidation, in a fresh blow to the thousands of workers whose jobs have been hanging in the balance since the company collapsed in May.", "authors": ["Olesya Dmitracova"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/15/british-steel-scunthorpe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
