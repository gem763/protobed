The fire has scorched more than 66,000 acres, destroyed nearly 100 structures, and forced an unprecedented evacuation of more than 185,000 people in the area.\n\nIn the south of the state, a blaze broke out in the early morning near the Getty art museum in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, hailed \u201ca lot of amazing heroes\u201d while warning residents to heed evacuation warnings. \u201cIf you have an evacuation notice and you are still in your home, leave. We have seen tragedies before ... get your loved ones and your pets and go,\u201d he said.\n\nNo deaths from either blaze were reported, but a firefighter was seriously injured in the wine country fire in Sonoma county.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Firefighters look at the rotation of helicopters dropping water on the Getty fire spreading in the hills behind the Getty Center.

The Weather Channel reported that the state would see a third round of fire danger on Tuesday and southern California could see its highest winds yet.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 2 million people remained without electricity, after the state\u2019s largest utility company, Pacific Gas & Electric, shut off power over the weekend to prevent its equipment from sparking blazes. PG&E said it was slowly restoring power to customers, but it warned that more deliberate blackouts were possible in the coming days because of the new round of high winds in the forecast.\n\nConditions statewide made California \u201ca tinderbox\u201d, said Jonathan Cox, a spokesman for the California department of forestry and fire protection.\n\n'This time feels worse': California fire has troubling echoes of 2017 blaze Read more\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Getty fire broke out at 1.34am local time near the museum and the 405 Freeway, in dry brush.\n\nThe Getty Center said its museum grounds remained safe as of Monday morning, with the fire burning to the north and west of the property. The art was also protected by \u201cstate-of-the-art technology\u201d, the center said, adding, \u201cThe safest place for the art and library collections is inside.\u201d\n\nThe Getty fire forced the evacuation of the NBA star LeBron James and the former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the Terminator star tweeting that his neighbors should flee when ordered: \u201cIf you are in an evacuation zone, don\u2019t screw around. Get out.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:30 California: thousands evacuated as wildfires spread \u2013 video\n\nThe flames also threatened Mount St Mary\u2019s University, a local college, and a spokeswoman said all 450 students were evacuated to the university\u2019s campus near downtown. .\n\nThe region is no stranger to destructive fires. In 2017, the Skirball fire destroyed six Bel Air homes, valued at roughly $20m. Last week, the nearby Pacific Palisades fire also damaged several multimillion-dollar homes near the beach.\n\nThere are more than a dozen fires burning across the state, and with no rain in the forecast and more winds, the outlook in the coming days is grim.\n\n\u201cThis is when we have the most potential for large and damaging fires,\u201d said Thom Porter, chief of the California department of forestry and fire protection (Cal Fire). \u201cAll of California is in play right now.\u201d\n\nThe high winds expected in southern California could help spread the Getty fire if firefighters in Los Angeles are not able to contain it by the time the winds pick up. And conditions could complicate efforts to extinguish the still-burning Kincade fire, which as of Monday morning was only 5% contained.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A helicopter drops water as the Getty fire burns on Kenter Canyon in Los Angeles.

In the city of Santa Rosa, some residents have only just returned to homes destroyed by the 2017 northern California fires, which killed 44 people, when they were forced to flee the Kincade blaze.\n\nCoffey Park, a dense neighborhood in north Santa Rosa, is still deep in the midst of rebuilding. With smoke from the fire bearing down over the weekend, many Coffey Park residents had evacuated. But on Sunday, one woman stood in the doorway of her home that she recently, finally finished rebuilding after wildfires in 2017. She covered her face with her hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving again,\u201d said Debbie, who decline to give her last name. \u201cThis time I\u2019m gonna stay and I\u2019m gonna burn in my house.\u201d\n\nPG&E, which was driven into bankruptcy because of legal claims over its role in several deadly wildfires in recent years, admitted on Monday that despite the outages, its power lines might have started two smaller fires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has also said its transmission lines may have been responsible for the Kincade fire.\n\nWith heavy smoke spilling out over the Bay Area on Monday, commuters noticed a new trend: a growing number of area residents donning air masks that can help filter particles floating in the smoky air.\n\nExperts recommend that residents limit their time outdoors, but the thousands of people forced to sleep outdoors as a result of the housing crisis don\u2019t have that luxury. A local organization, Mask Oakland, has been organizing volunteers to hit the streets and hand out air masks to the homeless.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Two million still without power after weekend shutoffs as wine country fire scorches 66,000 acres", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02f6cd65ee97baed9a1df5dcbfb9db5d676aaa38/0_0_4663_2797/master/4663.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22c723bf5a80d639f92ddc587f69921d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
