An image clearly meant to evoke awe and grandeur, it instead hits like a thud \u2014 in part because of the cheap-looking costuming, haphazard choreography, and unconvincing potboiler dialogue that leads to this moment, but mostly because of all the wasted potential it embodies.\n\nThe new CW series \u2014 set within the Arrow universe, after star Ruby Rose\u2019s debut as the character in last year\u2019s crossover event \u2014 broadly pulls its story from the 2010 graphic novel Batwoman: Elegy (by Greg Rucka, with art by J.H. Williams III and colors by Dave Stewart). Kate Kane is a West Point dropout, having lost both her Army career and girlfriend Sophie (Meagan Tandy) in one fell swoop after refusing to hide that she\u2019s a lesbian. As amber-toned flashbacks dictate, she also has tragedy in her past, having lost her mother and sister in a car accident from which Batman couldn\u2019t save them. The show picks up three years after Bruce Wayne\u2019s disappearance from Gotham, where Kate returns after hearing of Sophie\u2019s kidnapping at the hands of main villain Alice and her Wonderland gang. While navigating the dynamics of her blended family, Kate learns of Bruce\u2019s secret identity and picks up the mantle in order to protect Gotham.\n\nOn the surface this story presents a lot of opportunity to question notions of familial loyalty, identity, and trauma, but based on the first two episodes provided to critics, Batwoman doesn\u2019t seem so sure of its own existence. In broadly adapting Elegy, the minds behind Batwoman \u2014 including creator and writer Caroline Dries and director Marcos Siega \u2014 leech out much of the story\u2019s emotional bramble and intrigue. But even without considering the comics the show draws from, Batwoman offers scant pleasure that would separate it from the plethora of superhero stories saturating film and television today.\n\nGoing into Batwoman I wondered if the show would fall victim to Arrow\u2019s problem of making Green Arrow into a Walmart-issued Batman, but the problem with Kate Kane isn\u2019t that she\u2019s been flattened into a watered-down version of Bruce Wayne. Rather, it\u2019s that she exists too much in his shadow, with the leaden voice-over that drowns out the series taking its cues from the letters Kate writes Bruce. The show doesn\u2019t seem to know how to handle Bruce\u2019s absence, so he\u2019s mentioned at every turn, making Kate feel less like a person with her own story than someone grafted onto his. Just as with Alice and the Wonderland gang \u2014 which are stripped of their supernatural and uncanny elements, making Alice come across as a grating Harley Quinn knockoff \u2014 Kate loses any sense of distinction that might make her approach to crime-fighting feel vibrant or intriguing. She\u2019s just another street-level vigilante with no personality or style of her own to set her apart.\n\nBatwoman\u2019s inability to step out of Batman\u2019s shadow wouldn\u2019t be such a problem if anything else in the series clicked into place, but unfortunately there is little to hold onto. The show is as muddled visually as it is narratively, with heavy-handed, honey-hued flashbacks bursting into focus, sometimes without good reason, before the present-day scenes can gain any rhythm. Gotham is too clean, not lived-in enough to sell its storied history. The visual palette is all muddled grays or treacly, warmly lit flashbacks. The fight scenes lack tension and dynamism, relying on quick cuts and multiple angles to manufacture a false sense of energy.\n\nThere\u2019s also a missing spark of chemistry among the cast. The scenes meant to show the connection between Sophie and Kate feel awkward, and Dougray Scott and Rose can\u2019t sell their characters\u2019 tense father-daughter dynamic. The flimsy backbone of the series is the push and pull between Kate and Alice, but a crucial scene in the second episode that sees the two characters playing off each other \u2014 affected by a reveal that they\u2019re closer than Kate originally thought \u2014 lacks the verve necessary for the emotional throughline to work.\n\nBatwoman clearly has a lot of kinks to work out based on these early episodes, but there is one problem that won\u2019t be so easy to fix: Ruby Rose. She perpetually squints her eyes in a poor approximation of a scowl meant to show how tough and edgy the character is, but it only highlights the extent to which the character\u2019s cocky bravado and thorny moral considerations have been sanded off in favor of something more easily recognizable. There\u2019s little going on behind Rose\u2019s narrowed eyes, making the role feel more like posturing than a lived-in character. It\u2019s a textureless, bland, hollow performance that mutes the character\u2019s potential to evolve into something more intriguing. There\u2019s still a chance that Batwoman can grow more visually inventive and narratively dynamic from here, but if the heroine at its center isn\u2019t strong enough, all the potential in the world won\u2019t be enough to hold the series together.", "description": "A review of the new CW superhero series Batwoman, starring Ruby Rose as Kate Kane, who takes up Batman\u2019s mantle during Bruce Wayne\u2019s absence from Gotham.", "authors": ["Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-batwoman-ruby-rose.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
