Freezing for medical reasons allows storage for up to 55 years.\n\n'Outdated legislation'\n\nFertility charity the Progress Educational Trust (PET) says women are being pushed to delay egg freezing later and later, because of the 10-year limit for storing them.\n\nThe best time for a woman to freeze her eggs is before the age of 35, when the quality and number of eggs starts to decline - but the most common age for doing it is now 38.\n\nSarah Norcross, director of PET, said the current limit was \"a very clear breach of human rights\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There were 1,463 freeze cycles carried out in 2017 in the UK\n\n\"It curtails women's reproductive choices, harms women's chances of becoming biological mothers, does not have any scientific basis (eggs remain viable if frozen for longer than ten years) and is discriminatory against women because of the decline in female fertility with age.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is an arbitrary and outdated piece of legislation that does not reflect improvements in egg-freezing techniques and changes in society, which push women to have children later in life.\"\n\nThe Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority says egg freezing is not a guarantee of being able to have a baby in the future.\n\nBut it recognises that society has changed and women may feel frustrated if they aren't ready to use their frozen eggs within 10 years.\n\n\"Whilst any change to the 10-year storage limit would be a matter for parliament as it requires a change in law, the time might be right to look at what a more appropriate storage limit could be in future that recognises both changes in science and in the way women are considering their fertility,\" a spokesman said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption After thawing, the surviving eggs are injected with sperm\n\nWhat is egg freezing?\n\nIt is a way of preserving a woman's fertility by collecting eggs at a young age and storing them until needed.\n\nThe process involves collecting around 15 eggs through IVF, cooling them quickly (using a process called vitrification) then storing them in tanks of liquid nitrogen.\n\nThe eggs are then thawed when needed, and those that have survived intact will be injected with sperm.\n\nThere is no guarantee it will work - just one in five IVF treatments using a patient's own frozen eggs were successful in 2017.\n\nIf a woman is having medical treatment that affects fertility, funding may be available for egg freezing.\n\nOtherwise, the average cost of an egg-freezing cycle is \u00a37-8,000.\n\nSource: HFEA", "description": "The current 10-year limit is frustrating women who want to delay parenthood, experts say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2C10/production/_109408211_sharon2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
