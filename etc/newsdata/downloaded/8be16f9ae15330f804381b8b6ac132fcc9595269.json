On Friday his probation was reduced to three months, but he has also been ordered do perform community service, delivering brief speeches on the importance of jury duty each week.\n\nSomerville explained he slept through his alarm and woke up hours later to realize he had missed jury service. He said he did not call the court to let them know what happened because he felt nervous, and he was in a rush to leave for his afternoon job working afterschool programs at the city\u2019s parks and recreation department.\n\n\u201cAt work, I was looking on my phone thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the worst-case scenario that could happen?\u2019 I thought maybe I would get a fine or something like that,\u201d Somerville said. A police officer showed up at the door of his grandparents' house, where he resides, bringing along a court summons.\n\nFLORIDA WOMAN ARRESTED AFTER PARENTS FIND 24 PIPE BOMBS IN HER BEDROOM\n\n\u201cMy grandfather said, \u2018Just go in and be honest,\u2019\u201d said Somerville. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a criminal background, never been arrested, never been in handcuffs. The most I\u2019ve ever gotten was a traffic ticket so I was thinking it wouldn\u2019t be that bad.\u201d\n\n\"I said, 'Sir, honestly I overslept and I didn't understand the seriousness of this.' He asked me if I had a criminal record. I said, 'Sir, I've never been arrested,'\" Somerville told WPTV he had said at his court hearing.\n\nThe West Palm Beach judge was not happy, seemingly unimpressed, said the 21-year-old had held the court up by 45 minutes. Ultimately, an alternate juror was selected to take his place. Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes found Somerville in criminal contempt of court and sentenced him to 10 days in jail, 150 hours of community service and a $223 fine.\n\nFIFTH PARENT RECEIVES SENTENCE IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL AND IT'S THE STIFFEST ONE YET\n\n\"Now I have a record,\" Somerville said. \"I almost feel like a criminal now. Now, I have to explain this in every interview.\" He said he plans to go to school to become a firefighter.\n\nAfter criticism, Judge Kastrenakes reduced Somerville\u2019s sentence Friday. He\u2019d already served the 10-day jail time and his letter of apology was accepted by the court. Instead of a year\u2019s probation, Somerville will now serve three months, according to The Sun-Sentinel.\n\n\n\nAnd instead of 150 hours of community service, he\u2019ll serve 30, which includes his weekly speeches to new jurors on the importance of jury duty.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cGood people make bad mistakes, and this is a classic example,\u201d Kastrenakes told The Sun-Sentinel. \u201cJury misconduct is a serious concern,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Deandre Somerville, 21, spent 10 days in jail and originally faced a year of probation for oversleeping and missing his jury duty, until Friday his probation was reduced to three months and he was ordered to give 10-minute speeches on the importance of jury duty each week.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/prison-cell-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
