For all the brand loyalists out there who are obsessed with getting the latest iPhone, iPad, and MacBook the moment a new model comes out, this is kind of a big deal. For the rest of us, honestly, it's not that momentous an occasion. The more exciting news, especially for those who don't own an Apple watch at all, is that the Series 4 just dropped to a record low price on Amazon.\n\nIf you're in the market to upgrade your Series 3, or perhaps simply want to join the legions of Apple Watch owners, now's the time to snatch up the Series 4 while it's at the lowest price it's ever been\u2014$399.97 for the cellular model (save $115) and $349.97 for the GPS-only model (save $65). We fully expect these to go out of stock soon, so you need to act fast if you don't want to risk them selling out.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 is our favorite smart watch that we've ever tested for a variety of reasons. First of all, it's completely waterproof, so you can go swimming with it or hop in the shower without worrying about damaging it. It also gives you easy access to your messages and emails so you can send a quick text without pulling out your phone. For the fitness enthusiasts among us, it's also a great tool to track your efforts and sync your headphones and listen to music without lugging your phone around while exercising. Besides those basics, you'll also have the ability to track your steps, sleep habits, and heart rate, and have access to plenty of other apps that you'd normally need your phone to use.\n\nWe'll also let you in on a little secret: the Series 4 and the brand new Series 5 use the same processor, and have almost all the same functions, save for an always-on Retina display and a compass. In other words, it's not worth the upgrade. You'll be more than pleased with the Series 4, especially when you can save a huge chunk of change on it.\n\nGet the Apple Watch Series 4 (GPS + Cellular, 44mm) for $399.97 (Save $115.02)\n\nGet the Apple Watch Series 4 (GPS, 44mm) for $349.97 (Save $65.02)\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
