This is because the industry is growing rapidly, with new technologies constantly revolutionizing the way once manual tasks were performed.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy for investors to turn to well established names like tech giant Apple, these stocks don\u2019t always represent the most compelling investments. For example, Apple has about 3% downside from the current share price, according to best-performing analysts on Wall Street.\n\nSo how are investors supposed to find the tech stocks with the best long-term growth prospects. That\u2019s where TipRanks comes in. We used TipRanks' Best Stocks to Buy tool to track down three tech stocks that offer the highest upside potential, more than 40% to be exact.\n\nAdditionally, each is backed by Wall Street analysts, with all of the stocks receiving \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus ratings. This consensus rating is based on all of the calls published by analysts over the last three months.\n\nDropbox (DBX)\n\nDropbox is an online file hosting service that also provides client software, cloud storage and file synchronization. While DBX has seen its fair share of shakiness recently, one analyst just gave the tech stock a vote of confidence by bumping up the rating.\n\nNomura\u2019s Christopher Eberle argues that a turnaround is on the horizon. \u201cWe believe we are nearing an inflection in revenue after six quarters of deceleration as a public company coupled with attractive valuation,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis rebound could be driven in part by its efforts to revamp its image. At the end of September, the company announced that the \u201cnew Dropbox\u201d would be available for all users. The upgrade features a new interface and \u201cSpaces\u201d or collaboration hubs that come with comment streams, AI that can highlight files as well as Slack, Trello and G Suite integrations.\n\nWhile DBX did increase its pricing, Eberle notes that \u201cprice increases have taken hold with manageable levels of churn\u201d. As a result, the analyst upgraded the rating from a Hold to a Buy and set a $25 price target.

The \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 stock\u2019s $31 average price target suggests 56% upside potential.

That being said, Zendesk is a force to be reckoned with in the space.\n\nThe company offers both support ticketing system and customer service software to meet the needs of organizations of any size. However, ZEN has remained committed to expanding its product offerings. On October 3, the company unveiled its new API-based platform, Sunshine Conversations, which allows businesses to use social media and messaging services to communicate directly with their customers. Additionally, ZEN also announced the release of Gather, its new product for building online community forums, on the same day.\n\nWhile CRM recently broke the news of its Lightning Order Management product that competes with Sunshine, 5-star William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri\u2019s bullish thesis remains very much intact.\n\n\u201cThe new solution from Salesforce appears to be a deeper data integration between its own Commerce and Service Cloud offerings. In our view, not every company will want to standardize on Salesforce, and for existing Zendesk customers, we see little immediate impact as these customers are still likely to adopt Sunshine to enhance their agent experience since they are current Zendesk users,\u201d he commented. This prompted the analyst to reiterate his Buy rating. (To watch Suri\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nStory continues", "description": "Tech stocks are a staple among investors.
