What's It Worth?", "language": "en", "text": "From left: Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) before the Democratic presidential debate in Houston, Sept. 12, 2019. (Tamir Kalifa/The New York Times)\n\nAfter next week\u2019s Democratic debate, pundits will inevitably argue over who won and who lost, and they\u2019ll scour the polls to see if any presidential candidate has gotten a \u201cbump\u201d in support.\n\nBut as high-profile as they are, debates rarely help a candidate break out of a crowded field. And strategists generally agree that post-debate spikes in the polls seldom last for long.\n\nA dozen candidates will be onstage at the CNN/New York Times debate Tuesday, but experts broadly agree that none of them are likely to see a significant change in fortunes in a single night.\n\nBefore the 2016 Republican primaries, Donald Trump\u2019s publicity-heavy campaign rolled along with impregnable strength, despite the fact that TV viewers rarely gave him high marks for his debate performances.\n\nThe current Democratic race has been characterized by a similar steadiness, experts say, with former Vice President Joe Biden continuing to command the support of around a quarter of Democratic respondents, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts rising consistently and sometimes surpassing him.\n\n\u201cDemocratic primary voters basically seem to be fine with their top three options,\u201d said Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the polling and analytics firm Data for Progress, referring to Biden, Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the possibility that a debate would drive a news cycle that would bolster a candidate,\u201d McElwee added. \u201cBut instead, what we\u2019ve seen is that those sorts of moments tend to fall off.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California is the only Democratic candidate this cycle who has seen a statistically significant jolt in the polls after a debate. At the first round of Democratic debates in late June, she confronted Biden on his past opposition to federally mandated school busing. She immediately leapt up in the polls, enjoying double-digit support among primary voters nationwide throughout July.\n\nPerhaps more important, the exchange gave her fundraising operation a shot of adrenaline: Just 24 hours after the debate, she had raised $2 million.\n\nBut she soon fell from the race\u2019s top tier and has not broken into the double digits in any major national poll since the start of August.\n\nMcElwee cited recent studies showing that candidates\u2019 success is strongly driven by the sheer amount of news coverage they manage to receive \u2014 an argument that was borne out by the success of Trump in the run-up to the 2016 primaries, when he was able to reverse the unfavorable opinions that most Republican voters held of him, not by changing the tenor of his campaign, but by securing almost nonstop coverage.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of different earned-media opportunities in the current climate \u2014 and debates are very important,\u201d McElwee said. \u201cBut if you look at the polling, there\u2019s been lots of people who have had good debates, bad debates, and at the end of the day, it hasn\u2019t really changed the broad structure of the race.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the broad scope of cable news coverage, the one hit per month of the debate is not enough to make a candidate break through,\u201d he added.\n\nDemocratic pollster Celinda Lake said that debates can help drive future coverage, resulting in a snowball effect. But she added that candidates\u2019 fortunes will largely be determined on the ground in early-voting states.\n\n\u201cI think that honestly, the debates are having more impact on news coverage than they are having impact on voters,\u201d Lake said. \u201cCandidates don\u2019t get known by unveiling a good plan at the debate. They become known by immersing themselves in these early states.\u201d\n\nTo qualify for November\u2019s debate, candidates will need to reach 5% support in two polls in early nominating states, or 3% in four early-state or national polls. These are higher thresholds than for any debate thus far. A bump after next week\u2019s debate could, at the very least, help candidates such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota or former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 who are now foundering in the low single digits \u2014 secure a spot onstage next month.\n\nBut historically, early debates have been more likely to disqualify a candidate than to provide a lasting jolt of momentum. In 2011, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas pledged in an early debate to eliminate three agencies from the executive branch if elected president but couldn\u2019t remember the name of one of the agencies. He never recovered from the flub. (When Trump became president, however, Perry was chosen to head the Department of Energy, the very agency he had forgotten to name.)", "description": "After next week's Democratic debate, pundits will inevitably argue over who won and who lost, and they'll scour the polls to see if any presidential candidate has gotten a \"bump\" in support.But as high-profile as they are, debates rarely help a candidate break out of a crowded field", "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CuA6bqstE0272wMcTDQBYQ--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/a3d7de237fb7fe28fc3d9f351747f0b0", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
