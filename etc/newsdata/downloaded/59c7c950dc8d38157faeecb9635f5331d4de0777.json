There\u2019s an eclectic mix of music playing in the background, mostly hits from the early-to-mid-2000s, which you\u2019ll find yourself singing along to.\n\nPro-tip: Get yourself a seat at the bar that overlooks the bustling kitchen section \u2013 that way you\u2019ll get to see what the most popular dishes are before ordering your own.\n\nQ1 restaurant review: No frills Vietnamese pho and other traditional cuisine in Tin Hau for an unbeatable price\n\nWho to take: One or two of your best mates, or maybe your parents. We wouldn\u2019t recommend bringing all of your friends here as, chances are, you won\u2019t be seated together.\n\nWhat\u2019s hot: We recommend the roasted bone marrow if you\u2019re not squeamish about that sort of thing, especially if you\u2019ve never tried it before. The marrow is juicy, and served with slices of toast that are deep-fried to perfection.\n\nThe VFC (Vietnamese Fried Chicken) wings are a perfect balance of sweet, sour, and spicy. They\u2019re also nice and crisp on the outside, yet still very moist on the inside.\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow (HK$128) Photo: Kelly Fung/SCMP\n\nThe Roasted Corn Congee with Hokkaido Uni isn\u2019t like congee at all, but is delightfully buttery, although it could do with a little more uni (sea urchin).\n\nIf you have a little more cash to splash (or if your parents fancy treating you!), get the shaking beef sharing plate. The beef is tender and flavourful. The order comes with rice, making this dish a meal on its own.\n\nWhat\u2019s not: Give the salt & pepper squid a miss. It\u2019s nothing tremendously special that you can\u2019t get elsewhere, for less cash. If you want to try the famous pho rolls, get here early, as they sell out quickly.\n\n6 Vietnamese restaurants in Hong Kong you need to try pho sure\n\nYou also can\u2019t book in advance here, which means if you\u2019re a party of four or more, there\u2019s a chance you may have to wait 40 minutes or longer for a table.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019re not a fan of decor-wise, it\u2019s that the tables are a little too crowded together \u2013 which is great if you really want to see what your neighbours have ordered, but less so if you\u2019re after a little privacy. There\u2019s no air-conditioning inside, either \u2013 which is not much of a problem now we\u2019re going into autumn, but won\u2019t be pleasant in the hotter weather.\n\nCost: Starters are HK$78. Dishes cost between HK$48 and HK$188. Desserts are HK$38-HK$138. Drinks range from HK$10 to HK$28.", "description": "We find Hong Kong\u2019s hottest eats \u2019n\u2019 treats", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/14ffddc0-f0b7-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires160135.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
