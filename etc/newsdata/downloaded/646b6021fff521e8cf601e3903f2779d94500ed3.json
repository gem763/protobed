There\u2019s plenty of charm, a smart boarding school and the remains of a 13th Century castle plus narrow medieval streets stuffed with half-timbered buildings housing pretty boutiques, restaurants and antiques shops.\n\nThe greystone Manorhaus hotel on Well Street has had plenty of incarnations: it\u2019s been a boarding house for Ruthin School, a doctor\u2019s surgery and a library. In the 1970s and 1980s, John Lennon\u2019s ex-wife Cynthia turned it into a restaurant with rooms, with their son Julian doing shifts in the kitchen.\n\nThe current owners, Gavin and Chris, an architect and musician, bought the hotel in 2002 and planned to own it for five years. That was 17 years ago. Now Gavin\u2019s down for his second stint as Ruthin\u2019s mayor and the couple are as embedded as the hotel\u2019s Tudor foundations.\n\nFascinating past: The greystone Manorhaus hotel on Well Street in Ruthin\n\nThey opened a second Manorhaus in the nearby, more touristy town of Llangollen but it\u2019s clear this hotel is still their passion project and thrives because it\u2019s evolved as impressively as the town itself.\n\nThere are quirks and glam touches; this is a wealthy corner of Wales and the cocktail bar gets plenty of traction. Below the bar, the hotel\u2019s 15th Century cellar is a cinema club; guests can choose their own films, but there are also weekly screenings with popcorn. Feel more bookish? There\u2019s a library with magazines, books and DVDs. The surrounding Clwyd Hills teem with walkers and a few years ago a sauna was added.\n\nUSP: A stylish hotel that doesn\u2019t cost the earth. Popular with walkers and cyclists but Ruthin has plenty to suit those looking to relax. Ruthin Craft Centre has exhibitions in ceramics, metalwork and textiles. In summer, the Ruthin Gaol is a museum, while Nantclwyd y Dre, built in 1435, showcases Welsh domestic history.\n\nThe restaurant is in a conservatory and has an eye on the classics, with cheese souffle and boeuf bourguignon\n\nThe rooms: Eight bedrooms with modern art and bold colours are tucked around corridors and in eaves. There\u2019s nothing fussy about them, the beds are comfortable, they\u2019re spacious and the Welshness shines through with blankets and local toiletries.\n\nThe food: The restaurant is in a conservatory and has an eye on the classics, with cheese souffle and boeuf bourguignon. On cinema club nights, the food is themed around the film. A glorious breakfast will set you up, with the full Welsh featuring local sausages, bacon and eggs.", "description": "The Mail on Sunday's Sarah Turner checked into Manorhaus Hotel in the small Welsh town of Ruthin.
