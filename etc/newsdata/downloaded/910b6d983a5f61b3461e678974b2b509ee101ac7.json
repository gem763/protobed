It\u2019s hard to imagine a good-faith interpretation of the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause that would allow Congress to grant tax exemptions to some churches and deny them to others because of their particular beliefs. If the IRS can withhold tax-exempt status from churches that support marriage equality, a future Trump-like president could simply invert that formula and punish churches unless they oppose it\u2014or abortion, or whatever other spiritual tenet they choose. Virtually every Democratic candidate is drafting policy ideas that could one day become 5-4 losses before the Roberts Court; very few of them are proposing something that could be rejected by all nine justices.\n\nThe Christian right enjoys unrivaled political power in the Trump era, but that hasn\u2019t stopped it from adopting the mien of a persecuted minority. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments only give credence to their claims. President Donald Trump, speaking at the Values Voter Summit over the weekend, told religious conservatives that he would \u201cnever allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon\u201d and referred to O\u2019Rourke as a \u201cwhacko\u201d for his proposal. \u201cAbolishing the exemption only for religious groups that do not toe the progressive line would be an outrageous oppression of church by state,\u201d National Review warned in an editorial. \u201cOther candidates have not yet echoed O\u2019Rourke. But the crowd applauded.\u201d\n\nPerhaps in recognition of the mistake, O\u2019Rourke partially walked it back over the weekend. \u201cThe way that you practice your religion or your faith within that mosque or that temple or synagogue or church\u2014that is your business, and not the government\u2019s business,\u201d he told MSNBC on Sunday. \u201cBut when you are providing services in the public sphere, say, higher education, or health care, or adoption services, and you discriminate or deny equal treatment under the law based on someone\u2019s skin color or ethnicity or gender or sexual orientation, then we have a problem.\u201d This re-articulation more closely resembles the Equality Act, a proposed LGBT civil-rights bill that has broad Democratic support.\n\nSo why did O\u2019Rourke overreach? The former Texas representative\u2019s campaign has struggled to gain traction since his stumbling entrance into the race this spring, and he\u2019s never managed to break into the upper tier of candidates in the polls. O\u2019Rourke then found himself re-energized after the El Paso shooting in August, where he sharply criticized Trump for encouraging white supremacists and railed against the NRA\u2019s lobbying against a ban on AR-15-style firearms. In that context, he\u2019s also called for revoking that organization\u2019s tax-exempt status. Whatever the merits of that particular idea may be, its reasoning fits far worse in the context of religious freedom.\n\nWriting about a candidate\u2019s policy gaffes on the campaign trail feels strange in an era where Trump can successfully enact his Muslim ban. But it\u2019s genuinely hard to describe O\u2019Rourke\u2019s foray into federal tax policy and the separation of church and state as anything but an unforced error. Punishing houses of worship for their spiritual beliefs veers into precisely the kind of illiberalism that Democrats are hoping to overthrow. This idea should be quickly excommunicated, no matter how much applause it may receive.", "description": "Desperate to stand out, he has proposed perhaps the worst idea of the Democratic primary.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/1e1a4ce1c6c63de8c9f19bce61c3298989c0c1f7.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
