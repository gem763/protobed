Please, I\u2019m begging congress to allow them to live in that hope.\u201d\n\nThe Senate unanimously reauthorised the Debbie Smith Act in May and sent it to the house. It has not moved.\n\nThe leaders of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) said on Friday they had gathered 32,000 signatures from online petitions that they were presenting to house leadership in hopes it would push Senate Bill 820 towards passage.\n\nScott Berkowitz, RAINN president and founder, said: \u201csome in the house are using it [the Debbie Smith Act] as leverage to get the Senate to pass other things that have nothing to do with DNA testing. We need Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader [Steny] Hoyer to step up.\u201d\n\nMr Hoyer\u2019s staff said that the house had reauthorised the Debbie Smith funding as part of its vote in April to reauthorise the Violence Against Women Act, meaning that the funding has passed both houses of congress but in different bills.\n\n\u201cWe are discussing next steps with the [House] Judiciary Committee,\u201d said Mariel Saez, a spokeswoman for Mr Hoyer, who said he \u201dcontinues to urge\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell \u201dto take up the VAWA reauthorisation passed by the house in April, which includes the Debbie Smith Act reauthorisation\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The current bill authorises the US Justice Department to spend up to $151m (\u00a3123m) in grants to states and localities for costs associated with testing DNA evidence, to include employee training and equipment for labs to increase their testing capacity.\n\nThe problem of DNA going untested for months or years is not a new one. Sometimes, evidence is taken from a victim or a crime scene and then left on a shelf in a police department. Sometimes the local or state crime lab is so backed up that it takes months just to get the evidence analysed.\n\nOnce a DNA profile is developed, it is submitted to CODIS, the national DNA databank, which already has about 17 million profiles, in hopes of finding a match.\n\nThe DNA can also help exonerate wrongly accused defendants, experts noted.\n\nAccording to the FBI, that system has produced more than 475,000 matches, solving crimes across the spectrum from murder to rape to burglary to vandalism.\n\nOf those 475,000 hits, the National Institute of Justice found, about 42 per cent came as a direct result of the Debbie Smith Act, or about 200,000 cases which might otherwise have gone unsolved.\n\nOne in five rape kits entered into the national DNA databank generates a match pointing to a serial rapist, RAINN said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That caused the number of samples awaiting testing to grow from 91,000 in 2011 to about 169,000 in 2017, the GAO found.\n\nAnd that is just the backlog in the labs. Mr Berkowitz said another 200,000 rape and DNA kits are estimated to still be held by law enforcement agencies, which is \u201da problem which is a lot bigger than we knew at the beginning\u201d.\n\nHe said some states are requiring police to audit their evidence rooms for untested kits.\n\n\u201cTo think there is a 200,000 sexual assault backlog is unconscionable,\u201d said congresswoman Ann Wagner, who has sponsored a number of bills aimed at sex crimes and trafficking. \u201cThis is one of the most important things we should be doing in congress.\n\n\u201cThis is a no-brainer. Shame on congress for not bringing this forward sooner.\u201d\n\nAt the news conference, Ms Smith did not retell her story of being raped in Virginia in 1989, and the evidence not being tested until 1994, when a match was made and a man convicted.\n\nBut she did reveal through tears that she had left her mother\u2019s deathbed in Ohio to travel to Washington to push congress forward.\n\n\u201cFor many, the Debbie Smith Act is their only hope for justice,\u201d she said. \u201cHope deferred is a slippery slope into the abyss of hope shattered for the victims who live in turmoil. Hope deferred means another day, week or year that a rapist remains on the street ... This program changes lives.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Debbie Smith was ready to tell her story again, if necessary. Rape victim. DNA evidence untested for years. Evidence finally tested.\u00a0Suspect identified and convicted. Her story helped inspire the federal Debbie Smith Act, first passed in 2004, to provide funding for testing and training to eliminate the vast backlog of untested DNA and rape kit evidence across the country.", "authors": ["Tom Jackman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/08/15/rapekits-ac8e4066-d193-11e9-87fa-8501a456c0031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
