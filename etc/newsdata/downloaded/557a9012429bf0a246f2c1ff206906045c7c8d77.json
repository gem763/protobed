REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nBy Helena Williams\n\nVENICE, Italy (Reuters) - Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters brought his \u201cUS + THEM\u201d concert movie to the Venice Film Festival on Friday, transporting audiences to one of his live performances.\n\nThe movie shows the British rocker on stage in Amsterdam in 2017, a stop during his \u201cUS + THEM\u201d worldwide tour, playing Pink Floyd songs as well as material from his last album \u201cIs This the Life We Really Want?\u201d\n\nBehind him, a series of videos address issues including conflict, the migrant crisis, civil rights and politics.\n\nThe film was screened out of competition at the festival, where Waters told Reuters its main message was \u201cjust love and peace\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe live in very very dangerous times and maybe in some small way this show ... is a kind of warning really, to say this is absurd what we\u2019re allowing to happen,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nWaters co-founded Pink Floyd in 1965, and became the British rock band\u2019s principal songwriter. The group was known for its experimental music, and enjoyed a global following with albums such as \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d and \u201cThe Wall\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy songwriting ... has always been just painting what I see ... and what I write about tends to involve inner workings of my heart and soul but also my attachment to the predicament of others,\u201d Waters said.\n\n\u201cPeople often said to me much earlier in my career \u2018why are your songs so fucking gloomy?, or \u2018why are you always banging on about stuff?\u2019. It\u2019s not a choice, you don\u2019t decide what to write, it\u2019s like saying to (Vincent) Van Gogh \u2018why do you paint sunflowers?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. There they were and I painted them\u2019.\u201d\n\nAsked about Brexit, Waters said he regretted Britons had voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. \u201cI think it will be a complete disaster for the UK,\u201d he said.\n\nWaters left Pink Floyd in 1985 to pursue a solo career. The band reunited in 2005 to perform at the Live 8 concert in London. Turning 76 on Friday, Waters said he has no intention of slowing down just yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy people are still listening to my songs and that I can still get bums on seats when I go on the road with a tour, and if people come and watch this movie and if they are moved by it I will be very happy about that as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI will keep going as long as there\u2019s breath in this body ... I\u2019ve got a few years left in me yet I believe.\u201d", "description": "Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters brought his \"US + THEM\" concert movie to the Venice Film Festival on Friday, transporting audiences to one of his live performances.", "authors": ["Helena Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427047706&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851TL-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
