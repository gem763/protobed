Its preparation owes much to the teachings of the classic 1969 cookbook \u201cChinese Gastronomy,\u201d by Tsuifeng Lin and Hsiang Ju Lin, and the advice of the chef Jonathan Wu. It is what the Lins call \u201ctwo-passes\u201d cooking, with the fish cooked twice, first to velvet it, then to cover it with sauce. (It\u2019s important, Wu notes, not to think of it as stir-frying with high heat but as gentle, careful cooking that does not break up the fish.) It\u2019s great with flounder as at China Xiang, but also with tilapia, with halibut, with whatever firm-fleshed white fish you can find at the market. You can substitute firm tofu in place of the fish, or go half and half. It\u2019s a dish to fall in love with, to make your own.\n\nFeatured in: The Dish That Will Make You Fall In Love With Chinese Food.", "description": "Here\u2019s a recipe that takes its flavor inspiration from a dish served at Nancy Xiao\u2019s restaurant China Xiang, in the theater district of Manhattan: a sweet-salty rice wine sauce over velveted fish Its preparation owes much to the teachings of the classic 1969 cookbook \u201cChinese Gastronomy,\u201d by Tsuifeng Lin and Hsiang Ju Lin, and the advice of the chef Jonathan Wu It is what the Lins call \u201ctwo-passes\u201d cooking, with the fish cooked twice, first to velvet it, then to cover it with sauce", "authors": ["Sam Sifton", "David Tanis", "Ali Slagle", "Mark Bittman", "Melissa Clark", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Julia Moskin", "Florence Fabricant", "The New York Times", "Elaine Louie"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/09/magazine/09mag-eat-image1/09mag-eat-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-09"}
