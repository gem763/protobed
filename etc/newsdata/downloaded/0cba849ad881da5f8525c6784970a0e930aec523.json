The almost-whispered vocals are drowned out by the wall of sound, setting the blueprint for the rest of the record.\n\nLike Before You Were Born and For The Guilty both evoke a blend of early-90s shoegaze, frantically jumping between picked guitar harmonies and heavy onslaughts.\n\nTWICE's Feel Special EP review: K-pop girl group mix EDM, hip hop and 90s vibes and make it work\n\nDIIV have ditched their light, surf-rock stylings, replaced by an all-encompassing sense of nostalgia.\n\nOn Taker, frontman Zachary Cole-Smith openly takes responsibility for his past, singing, \u201cYou watched my lips make/The promise I betrayed/The years I lived in vain/Chasing the pain with pain\u201d. This mesmerising assault of trudging guitars marks a more contemplative tone for the group as they come across at their most unified.\n\nBlankenship is the clear stand-out though, as Cole takes aim at the former CEO of an energy corporation. It\u2019s a timely climate protest song that stands up among the band\u2019s best tracks, with lines like \u201cThe earth is ownerless/Children lead the cry/You sold them all away/With thirty years of lies\u201d.\n\nJust like these lyrics, Deceiver feels more pressing and resonant with each spin.\n\nVideo of DIIV - Horsehead", "description": "The band has set aside their surf-rock style for a sense of nostalgia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/9ec845be-ea73-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires160821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
