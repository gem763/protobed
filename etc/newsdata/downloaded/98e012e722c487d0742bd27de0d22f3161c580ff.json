Another study found similar signs of a storm from around this period buried deep in Greenland's ice.\n\nPrompted by these two studies, a team of Japanese researchers scoured eye-witness reports in the ancient texts for accounts of the kind of spectacular light shows that usually accompany these enormous geomagnetic events.\n\nMany of the reports weren\u2019t dated, but the researchers could produce date ranges based on the astrologer who wrote the report. They managed to find three ancient tablets that mention an unusual red glow in the sky that matches with the timeframe for the radiation concentrations in the tree rings.\n\nAlso on rt.com Ancient delivery: Divers discover Roman shipwreck packed with perfectly preserved wine, olive oil & KETCHUP jugs\n\nThese observations were made around 2,700 years ago in Babylon and the Assyrian city of Nineveh and both are mentioned contemporaneously in the Bible.\n\nOne tablet says, \u201cred covers the sky,\u201d while another mentions a \u201cred cloud.\u201d The scientists say these were caused by the Sun\u2019s particles interacting with the atmosphere following the massive storm.\n\n\u201cThese findings allow us to recreate the history of solar activity a century earlier than previously available records,\u201d explained the study\u2019s senior author, Yasuyuki Mitsuma. \u201cThis research can assist in our ability to predict future solar magnetic storms, which may damage satellites and other spacecraft.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
