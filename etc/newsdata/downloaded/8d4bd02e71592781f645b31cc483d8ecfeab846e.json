If adopted as written, they warned in court filings, the new rules would \u201cstrike a mortal blow to crucial rights and protections that the settlement confers on vulnerable children.\u201d\n\nAfter the ruling, Carlos Holguin, who has litigated the case since 1985, said, \u201cWe are gratified that the court has ruled in the way it has to protect children from the worst excesses of immigration-related detention.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Flores settlement is the last bulwark against the Trump administration running roughshod over these children,\u201d Mr. Holguin added. \u201cThey wanted to detain children as a means of border control.\u201d", "description": "A federal judge issued a final order that prevents the government from enacting its plan to detain children for lengthy periods.", "authors": ["Miriam Jordan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/28/us/28-flores-PRINT/00flores-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
