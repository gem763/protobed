REUTERS/Rahel Patrasso\n\nThe U.S. automaker is pushing into electric vehicles at a time when car manufacturers around the world are racing to slash carbon dioxide emissions in order to comply with more stringent environmental standards in the European Union.\n\nFord\u2019s launches include electric variants of the Kuga and Puma SUVs and the Mondeo sedan. The automaker also plans to launch nine other electric vehicles by 2024 in Europe, including a new Mustang-inspired electric sports utility vehicle next year.\n\nThe automaker unveiled the models at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany, and said it would partner with six leading energy suppliers across Europe to provide home-charging wall box installation services.\n\nThe carmaker, like its rivals, has been facing stagnant demand and rising costs as it invests billions of dollars in electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles in efforts to boost sales.\n\nThe company\u2019s European business has been losing money for years and the pressure to restructure its operations increased after rival General Motors raised profits by selling its European Opel and Vauxhall brands to France\u2019s Peugeot SA.\n\nIn a bid to slash development and manufacturing costs, Ford tied up with Volkswagen <AG VOWG_p.DE> in July to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.\n\nVW agreed to plow $3.1 billion into Ford\u2019s Argo AI self-driving unit, but estimated it could realize up to $20 billion in revenue by sharing its MEB electric vehicle architecture with Ford in Europe.\n\nFord had said it expects to build more than 600,000 electric vehicles in Europe over six years, sourcing components and the vehicle underpinnings from VW, helping both to cut costs.\n\nThe cooperation with VW on electric vehicles in Europe is part of Ford\u2019s previously disclosed $11.5 billion EV investment worldwide.\n\nThe challenge of investing in low-emission vehicles while having to overhaul combustion engines to meet new clean-air rules, has forced Europe\u2019s carmakers to slash fixed costs and streamline their model portfolios.\n\nThe company will also introduce a smartphone app that will let its users and operators locate, navigate to and pay for charging.\n\nFord said it expects its electric vehicle line-up to surpass sales of gasoline and diesel models by 2022 in Europe, and expects to sell 1 million electric vehicles by then.
