WRAPUP 7-Oil, shares fall on potential limit on China investments\n\n(Adds close of U.S. markets)\n\n* MSCI's world equity index closes down\n\n* Shares on Wall Street post biggest weekly loss since\n\nAugust\n\n* Trump impeachment talk adds to geopolitical risk\n\n* U.S.-China trade optimism boosts shares in Europe\n\n* But investors see major deal in October unlikely\n\n\n\nBy Herbert Lash\n\nNEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Oil prices and a gauge of\n\nglobal equity markets fell on Friday on media reports that the\n\nadministration of President Donald Trump may limit U.S.\n\nportfolio investments into China, a move that would mark an\n\nescalation of U.S.-Sino trade tensions.\n\nThe delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges\n\nwas part of a broad effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese\n\ncompanies, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.\n\nShares on Wall Street pared gains to close down. The\n\nbenchmark S&P 500 posted its biggest weekly loss since Aug. 23,\n\nand the Nasdaq posted its the biggest weekly loss since Aug. 2.\n\nChinese shares listed on U.S. exchanges tumbled, with\n\nAlibaba Group Holding BABA.N falling 5.15% and JD.com\n\n5.95%. Baidu slipped 3.67%.\n\nRenewed high-level trade talks between Washington and\n\nBeijing are scheduled for next month.\n\n\"If our policies spark a major sell-off in Shanghai where\n\nthat creates problems for China, that could negatively impact\n\nthe trade negotiations,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market\n\nstrategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nGold pared some losses, after falling more than 1%, as\n\ninvestors opted for the safety of bullion following the\n\ndelisting reports.\n\nMSCI's world equity index , which tracks\n\nshares in 47 countries, had rebounded earlier in the session on\n\noptimism the U.S.-China trade row might be easing. Markets\n\nlargely brushed off concerns about impeachment moves against\n\nTrump.\n\nThe world index closed down 0.41%, while on Wall Street the\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average fell 73.28 points, or 0.27%,\n\nto 26,817.84. The S&P 500 lost 17.2 points, or 0.58%, to\n\n2,960.42 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 90.06 points,\n\nor 1.12%, to 7,940.60.\n\nMajor equity indexes in Europe earlier closed higher, even\n\nas data showed slowing growth around the world. U.S. data showed consumer spending barely rose in August and\n\nbusiness investment remained weak, suggesting the American\n\neconomy was losing momentum as trade tensions linger.\n\nStill, the Commerce Department reports likely do not signal\n\na recession is looming as consumer spending remains supported by\n\nsolid income growth thanks to the lowest unemployment rate in\n\nnearly 50 years and massive savings.\n\nA strong rally in mining shares propped up European shares,\n\nbut they ended the week lower for the first time in five weeks\n\nas concerns about economic growth and trade, as well as\n\npolitical worries, kept a lid on gains. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.47%\n\nand the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional\n\nshares gained 0.41%.\n\nEarlier in the day, Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nwere buffeted by the political worries in the\n\nUnited States and shed 0.3%.\n\nOil prices fell and posted a weekly loss on\n\nfaster-than-expected recovery in Saudi output, while investors\n\nalso worried about global crude demand amid slowing Chinese\n\neconomic growth.\n\nDuring a volatile session, Brent crude futures fell\n\n83 cents to settle at $61.91 a barrel.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell\n\n50 cents to settle at $55.91 a barrel.\n\nIn China, the world's second-largest economy and biggest\n\nimporter of crude oil, industrial companies reported a\n\ncontraction in profits in August.\n\n\"If the global economy weakens, for which there are already\n\nsome signs, we may lower oil demand expectations,\" IEA Executive\n\nDirector Fatih Birol told Reuters.\n\nBond yields in France and Spain posted their biggest weekly\n\ndecline in six weeks, while a key market gauge of the euro\n\nzone's inflation expectations fell to its lowest level since\n\nearly July at 1.188% EUIL5YF5Y=R , heading back toward record\n\nlows hit in June.\n\nFrench and Spanish 10-year bond yields were down 6-9 basis\n\npoints this week, their biggest weekly decline in six weeks\n\n.\n\nU.S. Treasury prices traded little changed after U.S. data\n\nwas weaker than expected and as month- and quarter-end\n\nrebalancing increased demand for safe-haven U.S. debt.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes traded at break-even to\n\nyield 1.6853%.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.05%, with the euro up\n\n0.2% to $1.0943.
