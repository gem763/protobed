A less appreciated reason for lower rates is a mountain of debt built up during the past decade.\n\nDebt owed by governments, businesses and households around the globe is up nearly 50% since before the financial crisis to $246.6 trillion at the beginning of March, according to the Institute of International Finance.\n\nThe borrowing helped pull economies out of the nasty recession, but left them with high debt burdens that make it harder for policy makers to raise rates. It also makes consumers and businesses more likely to pull back from spending money on new goods if economic conditions weaken.\n\n\u201cGlobally, you are at worryingly high levels,\u201d said Sonja Gibbs, managing director for global policy initiatives at the IIF. She said policy makers need to consider debt levels as they adjust interest rates. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an impact on the broader economy.\u201d\n\nIn the U.K., Canada and Australia, central bankers have backtracked from rate increases in the past two years after consumers got bruised more than expected. U.S. consumers, who have borrowed to pay for college, cars and everyday spending, have been less affected because their debt burdens are much lower relative to their incomes.\n\n\u201cThe world is in a delicate equilibrium,\u201d said Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, in a February speech. \u201cThe sustainability of debt burdens depends on interest rates remaining low and global trade remaining open.\u201d\n\nMr. Carney and other central bankers would have liked to raise rates further during the good years to give themselves room to cut when economies slowed. But the higher rates hit their economies harder than many expected.\n\n\u201cTightening may have had more of a restraining effect than anticipated,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve. \u201cIt acts as a very powerful drag on spending.\u201d\n\nThere is a direct connection between debt, interest rates and growth. Rising rates force consumers and businesses who take on adjustable-rate loans such as credit-card debt to pay more each month and reduce other spending. Even with fixed-rate loans, borrowers know they will have to pay higher rates to roll over the loans, so they start putting aside money that they would have otherwise spent.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much for countries loaded down with debt to feel the strain. When the Bank of Canada raised interest rates in July 2017, the first increase in seven years, officials said higher rates signaled the economy was strong.\n\nBut the country\u2019s households had been borrowing heavily, pushing their ratio of after-tax pay to debt to the highest level among the world\u2019s most-advanced economies. After five increases drove the interest rate up to 1.75%, the resulting slowdown in growth was \u201csharper and more broad-based than we expected,\u201d said former Bank of Canada deputy governor Lynn Patterson during a March speech. The bank stopped raising rates far short of the 4.25% level in place before the financial crisis.\n\nU.S. consumers are better off because so much mortgage debt was wiped out in the financial crisis. The impact of higher rates was tempered by the popularity of fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nBut higher rates squeezed U.S. consumers with lots of credit-card debt and big auto loans, said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. Average auto-loan interest rates jumped by almost 2 percentage points in 2018 to roughly 5% for 60-month loans, while delinquency rates jumped from roughly 4% to more than 4.5%.\n\nWhen Bank of Canada began raising interest rates in 2017, the country\u2019s households had been borrowing heavily.

Companies such as toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker Inc. blamed weaker sales on higher rates. Others, including Coca-Cola Co. , complained about the impact of higher interest costs on their expenses.\n\nIn January, the Fed signaled it was pausing its rate increases after worries grew about the economy, including the housing market, global growth and the impact of the trade war. \u201cThe fundamentals for consumers are more worrying than we think,\u201d Mr. Slok said.\n\nThe Bank of England, facing the risks of Brexit on top of growth and trade worries, last raised interest rates more than a year ago. One reason is that households and businesses are struggling with debt. Through the first three months of this year, households spent more money than they made, marking an unprecedented run of 10 quarters of net borrowing, according to the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics.\n\nBusiness defaults, meanwhile, rose in England and Wales during the second quarter of this year to the highest level since the first quarter of 2014, according to the government\u2019s Insolvency Service. Short-term rates in the U.K. are at 0.75%, down from 5.75% in July 2007.\n\nIn Australia, where consumers owe $2 for every dollar they earn, economists at the country\u2019s central bank found that every 10% increase in debt shaves household expenditures by 0.3%.\n\nPhilip Lowe, Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s governor, acknowledged that the borrowing is leading to softer consumption when he announced in July that the bank would lower its benchmark rate to an all-time low of 1%.\n\nIt appears poised to fall again. The board kept rates unchanged on Tuesday but in its\u200b\u200bSeptember statement said it \u201cwill ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time.\u201d\n\nWrite to Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com", "description": "A mountain of debt built up during the past decade has made some economies more fragile as global growth slows, adding to the challenges faced by central banks.", "authors": ["Vipal Monga", "Vipal.Monga Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103540/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
