September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

The Staples Center is an unbelievable venue and I\u2019m hearing that 20,000 people are expected to be packed in on the night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great chance to get some new fans onboard and a chance to capitalise on putting my name in the big lights in America. The KSI vs Logan Paul rematch has really captured the imagination of the British and American public and it\u2019s something that sells. Fair play to them both, it\u2019s going to be a great show.\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018oh you\u2019re on the undercard\u2019, but I feel like we\u2019re all sharing the show, we\u2019re all absorbing that energy off the fans. I\u2019ve seen the numbers they attract, over six million people watched the press conference alone, and all eyes will be on us on November 9.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to making my debut with Matchroom Boxing live on DAZN. There\u2019s been some brilliant names signed to DAZN recently and there\u2019s some big names on the platform. It\u2019s time to really put my impressing shoes on and put my name out there for those big fights to be made.\u201d\n\nIt's expected that Saunders' appearance on the card will be a routine defence of his title before potential fights against the likes of Callum Smith and a rematch with Chris Eubank Jr in 2020.\n\nPromoter Hearn believes his new signing is one of the best in the middleweight and super-middleweight divisions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really pleased for Billy that he will get to make his US debut on November 9 at the superb Staples Centre,\u201d said Hearn.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the sport knows that he is one of the best out there at 160lbs and 168lbs and he wanted the opportunity to prove that he is the best.\n\n\u201cThis event will be huge with a chance for Billy to box in front of a massive global audience of boxing fans and a casual audience that we hope will fall in love with our sport. A strong performance in November can set up all the mega fights for him in 2020.\u201d", "description": "Billy Joe Saunders will make the first defence of his WBO super-middleweight title on the undercard of KSI and Logan Paul II.
