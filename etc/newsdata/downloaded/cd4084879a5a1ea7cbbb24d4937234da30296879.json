Sixers star dreams of career in education after NBA", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Sports Pulse: With players like Matisse Thybulle, the Sixers defense is going to be on the next level! USA TODAY\n\nEven though Tobias Harris is an NBA veteran on the verge of becoming an All-Star who just signed a five-year, $180 million deal with the Philadelphia 76ers, he still has dreams beyond the basketball court.\n\nHe wants to own businesses and start his own school or become a principal. He understands the importance of education.\n\nHe wants the younger generation to have dreams, too, and that\u2019s why Harris pledged $1 million to be divided among nine non-profit organizations focused on education and unveiled two initiatives, Tobias\u2019 Lit Labs and Tobias\u2019 Top Teachers, which will provide resources for students and teachers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that knowledge is power, and for me it\u2019s the fact that I can do something that's going to impact the next generation. A lot of that has to do with education,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThe groups that will receive money: Read By 4th \u2013 Freedom Library of Philadelphia; The Center for Black Education Development (Philadelphia); The Fund for The School District of Philadelphia; Team Up Philly; World Literacy Foundation (Africa); True Love Mission (Haiti); Foundation For Orange County Public Schools (Orlando, Florida); Nap Ford Community Schools (Orlando); Wyandanch (N.Y.) High.\n\nTobias Harris has pledged $1 million to nine non-profits to help teachers and students improve learning conditions and promote reading. (Photo: Philadelphia 76ers)\n\nHarris rattles off statistics: two-thirds of Philadelphia third graders cannot read at grade level; one in four children nationwide grow up without learning how to read; 90% of classrooms in developing countries do not have electricity; a study showed that if a black student had just one black teacher in elementary school, their high school dropout rate decreases by 39%.\n\n\u201cA big thing we\u2019re doing here is combating illiteracy and allowing kids to be able to establish themselves as avid readers,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEducation is the footprint of getting yourself in the door and helping you be more successful in whatever you do.\u201d\n\nHarris selected organizations in the city he plays in (Philadelphia) or has played (Orlando), plus a school near his New York hometown. He also chose global organizations, including the World Literacy Foundation, which provides solar-powered tablets loaded with educational material to students in classrooms without power.\n\n\u201cI grew up wanting to do great things not only in the sport that I play but also outside of the game of basketball,\u201d Harris said. \u201cTo be able to give back to the community, especially Philadelphia where I call home, it\u2019s a true honor for me to do this and partner with some very good organizations.\u201d\n\nHe is intent on improving reading scores through those non-profits and his Lit Labs, which will focus on reading and technology.\n\nHarris loves reading and prefers physical books over reading on a tablet. One of his recent reads, The Lost Education of Horace Tate: Uncovering the Hidden Heroes Who Fought for Justice in Schools, inspired him to do more.\n\n\u201cI want kids to be able to pick up a book and feel like that\u2019s cool and not feel any other way about it, and I want kids to also understand that education is cool and being the smartest in the class is a big achievement,\u201d he said.\n\nEducation was a big part of Harris\u2019 childhood, and all of his siblings attended college, including his older brother Torrel Jr., who received an academic scholarship to Maryland.\n\n\u201cMy parents (Torrel and Lisa) always taught me to make sure I had a Plan A and a Plan B,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI had focused hard on my academics and education. When I got into the league, I did a lot with mentorships and now I\u2019ve been able to come up with a really good plan of being strategic and hitting certain spots I truly believe can be effective.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "Sixers forward Tobias Harris pledged $1 million to nine educational non-profits worldwide and started two initiatives to help students and teachers.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published A.M.
