They\u2019re round boys, floofs and absolute units.\n\nThe new animal trend on the internet celebrates the rotund and plump, with social media users focusing on the adorableness of a cat\u2019s rounded cheeks, a hamster\u2019s many rolls, a dog\u2019s rounded shape and a raccoon\u2019s voluptuous volume.\n\nThe Instagram account Chonky Animals has more than 409,000 followers while the Round Boys and Round Animals accounts top out at more than 455,000 and 487,000, respectively. The Facebook group, This Cat is Chonky, has more than 395,000 members and hundreds of new posts each day.\n\nThe trend raises concerns about overfeeding and keeping a pet unhealthy for the sake of cuteness. While humans can decide if they are healthy at every size, animals cannot, nor do they have the ability to tell their owners if they need help. But it has also inspired a wholesome movement toward making sure these animals remain healthy, as well as cute. More and more accounts are now dedicating themselves to specific chonky cats \u2013 and their weight-loss efforts.\n\n\u201cA heavy cat is pretty adorable,\u201d said Mike Wilson, one of the owners of Bronson, a cat who was 33 pounds when he was adopted and is now 23 pounds, one year later. \u201cA big cat on a diet is a guilt-free way to follow an obese cat.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Bronson, who has more than 214,000 followers, there\u2019s Bruno Bartlett, the gray polydactyl cat that likes to stand on his hind legs, and his brother, Carlo. On Facebook, Fat Laila\u2019s efforts at fat camp are lovingly documented, as well as her missteps \u2013 when she snuck into the closet to steal treats one night.\n\nHe was so adorable, but he could barely move Lauren Paris\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the internet is so obsessed with fat cats,\u201d said Lauren Paris, the owner of Bruno and Carlo. \u201cThey\u2019re so cute.\u201d\n\nParis felt drawn to Bruno when stories about a \u201cthicc\u201d cat up for adoption went viral last year. She and her friend wrote a song, Give Me That Fat Cat, ensuring not just the adoption, but Bruno\u2019s Instagram stardom.\n\nHowever, upon meeting him, she knew his claim to fame \u2013 his chub \u2013 could not stay.\n\n\u201cHe was so adorable, but he could barely move,\u201d Paris said. \u201cThe shelter was doing the best they could do, but he lived in a room with other cats and he would just eat their food.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bronson has now slimmed down to 23 pounds.

Paris posts when Bruno loses a pound, along with tongue-in-cheek hashtags such as \u201creal cats have curves\u201d. She posts pictures of him gazing longingly at human food, or meowing in the background to cooking bacon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, I think fat cats are cute, but not so cute that they shouldn\u2019t be on a diet,\u201d Paris said. \u201cBruno, we look back at old videos of him and we think, \u2018oh he\u2019s so cute,\u2019 but he\u2019s really cute now and he\u2019s going to live a lot longer. That\u2019s way better.\u201d\n\nWilson and Bronson\u2019s other owner, Megan Hanneman, felt the same way when it came to Bronson\u2019s health. When they met him, he had to lie down to eat. \u201cHe just looked like a giant swollen ball,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n\u201cHe was three years old and he weighed 33 pounds,\u201d Hanneman said. \u201cThe standard cat weighs like nine pounds, so he was about the size of three pretty large cats at three years old. He couldn\u2019t move around.\u201d\n\nBronson used to cry for more food before Wilson and Hanneman switched him to a wet diet that was less caloric but more filling. Even worse was when he would cajole them awake for feedings. \u201cAt 3 in the morning, he\u2019d come over and lay on us and purr in our faces,\u201d Hanneman said.\n\nFat cats are cute, but not so cute that they shouldn\u2019t be on a diet Lauren Paris\n\nThey enjoy posting about his weight-loss journey because cat weight loss is difficult. If cats lose weight too quickly, they can develop fatty liver disease, and typically sleep 18 hours a day and are hard to exercise, said Shari O\u2019Neill, the chief shelter veterinarian at the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Cats are also grazers, so it\u2019s hard to measure out how much food they need to get through a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun sharing tips on losing weight and things we\u2019re doing with Bronson, knowing that a lot of people have this issue with their cat, even if it\u2019s not that extreme,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nBut as with anything on the internet, there are trolls. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d Paris said. \u201cWe see, \u2018You\u2019re abusing this cat\u2019. We also see, \u2018I miss when Bruno was fat\u2019.\u201d\n\nSome of the top rules in the Facebook group, This Cat is Chonky, include no chonk-shaming, no owner-shaming and don\u2019t do politics or medical advice.\n\n\u201cPeople see a picture of a fat cat and they think we made it fat,\u201d Paris said. \u201cOr when we just started to show his weight-loss photos, people who don\u2019t know anything about cats will say, \u2018Oh, he only lost two pounds? Well he should have lost more by now.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cYou don\u2019t know why a cat is fat. You don\u2019t know what diets have been tried. You don\u2019t know if it has diabetes or not.\u201d\n\nIn between cute pictures of Bronson and videos of his monthly weigh-ins, Wilson and Hanneman also post about adoptable cats around the country that are largely overweight, something Paris thinks is a much-needed effort.\n\n\u201cSomething that\u2019s good about this internet trend is that it does draw attention to these pets that would be passed by traditionally,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these famous chonky cats came from shelters. I think that shines a really good light. Kittens are more likely to be adopted, but if these internet-famous chonky cats are more likely to get adult cats adopted, then we did our jobs.\u201d", "description": "More social media accounts are dedicating themselves to specific chonky cats \u2013 and their weight-loss efforts", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cebf3ac2e02f865e2ee1577576e34c1653a6e97/0_23_749_449/master/749.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=767fa6a92d09827163616c285425119d", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
