He underwent surgery following the incident. The Bangkok Post reported his injuries were not life-threatening.\n\nBefore the shooting a statement attributed to Khanakorn, widely distributed on social media, claimed that senior judges told him to change his verdicts in the case to guilty. This would have meant sentencing three defendants to death and two to jail.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, other fellow judges in Courts of First Instance across the country are being treated the same way as I was. [If] I cannot keep my oath of office, I\u2019d rather die than live without honour,\u201d the statement said.\n\nKhanakorn\u2019s statement sparked concerns that senior judges in Thailand\u2019s justice system were abusing power to get guilty verdicts delivered to suit political goals.\n\nA spokesperson for Thailand\u2019s Office of the Judiciary told the Bangkok Post that Khanakorn apparently shot himself because he had personal issues and was under stress.\n\nHowever Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, secretary-general of the country\u2019s Future Forward Party, said that Khanakorn had been trying to make claims about the court system public since early September.\n\nOn Saturday Workpoint News reported that Khanakorn was still being cared for in an intensive care unit in a Yala hospital.\n\n\u2022 International suicide prevention helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.
