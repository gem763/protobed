REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Ninety-nine couples tied the knot in a mass wedding ceremony at a Chinese temple in Malaysia on Monday, the ninth day of the ninth month that is considered an auspicious date by ethnic Chinese.\n\nThe ceremony at the Thean Hou temple in Kuala Lumpur is an annual event for couples seeking a Buddhist wedding. The number nine in Chinese sounds like the word for \u201clong lasting\u201d.\n\nMost of the couples donned black suits and white bridal dresses, but a few opted to wear red, a colour that symbolizes luck, joy and happiness in Chinese culture. Red is also a traditional color worn by Chinese brides.\n\nHolding bouquets of flowers, the couples were blessed by a priest in a red robe before taking their vows. The ceremony ended with a group photograph.\n\nEthnic Chinese account for about 23 percent of the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s population of 32 million people. Roughly a fifth of the population practises Buddhism.", "description": "Ninety-nine couples tied the knot in a mass wedding ceremony at a Chinese temple in Malaysia on Monday, the ninth day of the ninth month that is considered an auspicious date by ethnic Chinese.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427864504&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880IZ", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
