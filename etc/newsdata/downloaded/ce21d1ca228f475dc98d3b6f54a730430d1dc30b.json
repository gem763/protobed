Biegun has often struck a more pragmatic note than former national security adviser John Bolton, who pushed Trump to maintain a harder line in Hanoi but was fired last month.\n\nPolicy analysts said Bolton's departure could help US efforts to revive the talks. But they said it would not make Washington's aim of persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons any easier.\n\nThe North Korean delegation will be led by its former ambassador to Vietnam, Kim Myong Gil, who stepped in after his predecessor was reportedly removed in a diplomatic shakeup.\n\n\"There's been a new signal from the US side, so we're going with great expectations and optimism about the outcome,\" Kim told reporters in Beijing before boarding for Stockholm.\n\nSeeking concessions\n\nPyongyang will probably seek a declaration to end the state of war that has technically existed since the 1950-1953 Korean War, open liaison offices with the US and possibly seek economic aid, said Professor Ramon Pacheco Pardo at King's College London who has met North Korean officials as part of separate semi-official discussions.\n\nBut sanctions relief will be at the top of the list for the North Koreans because Kim Jong Un needs to show he is winning material benefits from Washington, Pacheco Pardo said.\n\n\"North Korea will want sanctions relief, however partial and even if it is the form of their interruption rather than full removal,\" he said. \"From Pyongyang's perspective, that would show that the US is serious about a step-by-step process.\"\n\nAny agreement at the working-level talks would probably need to be finalised at yet another summit between Trump and Kim, who have pinned hopes for a breakthrough based on their personal relationship.\n\nThe most visible and longest-running part of North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, is a central point of contention.\n\nSouth Korean officials have pressed Washington to accept the closure of Yongbyon in return for lifting at least some sanctions, arguing it would be a significant step towards curtailing North Korea's ability to build more nuclear weapons. Some observers, however, question how useful Yongbyon is.\n\nNuclear experts and American officials have estimated that North Korea may have had the material necessary to build up to a dozen more warheads since talks with the US in early 2018.\n\nKim offered to close the facility during the February summit with Trump, but US officials said he wanted too many sanctions lifted in exchange.", "description": "The talks follow a missile test this week and are the first since Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un met at the DMZ in June.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/7/31/accfe44bf3874f79808b37d6210a3502_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
