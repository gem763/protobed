But as some flights get longer, the question is whether passengers and flight crews can tolerate more hours in the air without a layover to break things up.\n\nQantas used this flight \u2013 and plans to do the same for the London route \u2013 to conduct research into how pilots, cabin crews, and passengers cope with the long flight time. In particular, data gathered from monitoring of the pilots and flight attendants will be used to help Qantas make a case to Australian aviation regulators that it\u2019s safe to have crew work in shifts for potentially 20 hours or more.\n\nThe airline also tested a redesigned cabin service, meant to help passengers minimise the effects of jetlag as they cross 15 time zones, and reduce the magnitude to which an ultra-long-haul flight can worsen those symptoms. Cabin lighting, meal services, and food options were tailored to help passengers and crew either feel more awake, or be more attuned to nighttime.\n\nThis flight also doubled as a delivery of a new Boeing 787-9, from Boeing\u2019s Seattle plant. There were only 40 passengers and 10 crew, including four on-duty pilots. Passengers included several Qantas frequent flyers taking part in the research study, off-duty Qantas employees, researchers, and media, including this reporter.\n\nThe flight with a full load of passengers and cargo is not yet possible \u2013 the heavier load would reduce the plane\u2019s fuel range.\n\nTwo planes in development from Airbus and Boeing would be capable of flying these routes. Qantas has said that it will decide by the end of 2019 which one it will use and that it expects to start commercial service as early as 2023, Alan Joyce, Qantas\u2019 CEO, said. The airline had previously hoped to launch service by 2022.\n\nDue to the low passenger load, each person was allocated a business-class seat that could convert into a bed. Passengers were also encouraged to spend some time in the coach cabin in order to balance the plane.\n\nAlthough the flight would obviously be a different experience in coach with a full plane, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce discussed several options to make an ultra-long-haul flight in coach more comfortable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless, the nearly 20-hour trek in business class, with the redesigned cabin service, was a notably different experience compared with other long-haul flights I\u2019ve flown in premium cabins, including first and business class.\n\nAside from that, it was truly a unique experience. After all, it\u2019s not every flight that you see an airline CEO doing calisthenics in his pyjamas.\n\nAlthough it is Business Insider\u2019s policy not to accept free travel, we were not able to pay for the New York to Sydney trip because it was classified as a \u201cferry flight\u201d, for which US Department of Transportation regulations prevent the airline from accepting any money for fares. Business Insider did pay for the return flight with the airline.\n\nFrom takeoff to landing, plus before and after, read on to see what the 19-hour and 16-minute flight was like.\n\nThe world\u2019s longest flight started somewhere much more ordinary \u2014 a bus, chartered to take passengers and staff from a hotel in Times Square, where several Qantas employees were staying, to JFK. In a portent of the long flight ahead, traffic getting to the airport was a virtual standstill.\n\nQantas flies from JFK\u2019s Terminal 8, which principally houses the airline\u2019s Oneworld alliance member American Airlines. For this particular flight, there was a dedicated check-in counter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was also a special touch on the boarding pass.\n\nWe headed through security to a cordoned-off area in the American Airlines lounge, as we waited for our boarding time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon enough, we went down to gate 12 and got a first glimpse of our home for the next day: a brand-new Boeing 787-9 aeroplane, registration VH-ZNI, delivered to Qantas from Boeing\u2019s factory in Seattle just a few days before.\n\nHere we go!\n\nThe business-class cabin on Qantas\u2019 787-9s is split into two sections \u2014 a larger cabin to the left of the boarding door, and a smaller 'mini cabin' with just three rows to the right. I was in the smaller cabin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s my seat, 11E.\n\nEach of Qantas\u2019 business-class seats has a small side table, and are consequently staggered, meaning some seats have the table between the seat and the aisle, and some seats \u2014 like mine \u2014 are directly against the aisle, and have the table on the inside. On some planes, this can feel a lot less private and make sleeping a bit harder, although it certainly wasn\u2019t an issue on this flight \u2014 more on that later.\n\nEach seat had a pair of headphones \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2026 which used a proprietary 3-prong plug that worked with the airline\u2019s in-flight entertainment system. Each seat also had a USB port and a universal power outlet\u2026\n\n\u2026 and a small storage area down near the floor.\n\nThere was also a storage area in a cubby under the seat in front of me. When the seat is turned into bed mode, this serves as the end of the bed \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of room for your feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we took our seats, flight attendants came around handing out Qantas\u2019 iconic business class pyjamas\u2026\n\n\u2026 and this set was printed specifically for the Project Sunrise flights.\n\nThey also distributed amenity kits \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2026 stocked with in-flight essentials.\n\nAs we settled in, the cabin manager gave his unique preflight announcement.\n\nThis may not have been a normal commercial flight, but many of the same rules applied \u2014 including the mandatory safety demonstration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut aside from those formalities, this was very much not a normal flight. For instance, we got to see and access some things that most passengers don\u2019t even know exist, like the pilot\u2019s crew rest.\n\nBecause the main purpose of this flight was to study how pilots and cabin crew could remain properly rested and alert during ultra-long-haul flights, the four pilots worked out a customised work schedule, in conjunction with the researchers.\n\nThe pilot-in-charge, Captain Sean Golding, described the shift period for the four pilots, who worked in two shifts:\n\n\u201cThe whole crew will be on for the first hour-and-a-half. Then, I\u2019ll take a two-and-a-half hour break. I\u2019ll work for the next five-and-a-half hours, sleep for the next five-and-a-half, work the next two-and-a-half, and we\u2019ll all be on for the final approach and landing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes, I sleep better on the long-haul flights than I do at home,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo objectively measure the pilots\u2019 alertness and adaptability to the long flight, each of them was outfitted with an EEG (electroencephalogram) headset to measure brain activity \u2026\n\n\u2026 an activity monitor \u2026\n\n\u2026 and a light monitor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pilots also gave urine samples every four hours, including before and after the flights, so their melatonin levels could be assessed.\n\nPassengers taking part in the research study wore slightly different activity monitors, and kept a journal logging their exercise, sleep, and meals in the days leading up to the flight \u2014 they will continue these in the days immediately after.\n\nPassengers and crew also completed an iPad-based reaction-time test at regular intervals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also took a look at the flight attendant break area. Unlike the pilots crew rest, which only had two bunks, the flight attendant area had six \u2014 one for each member of the cabin crew.\n\nAfter a surprisingly short taxi to the runway, we were in the air at exactly 9.27pm ET.\n\nAnother unique feature of this flight \u2014 aside from the fact that it had only 40 passengers on a plane that could fit more than 200 \u2014 was that the moment we took off, we began operating on our destination\u2019s time zone, rather than our origin\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was part of the anti-jet lag study being performed on several passengers. It was 12.30pm Sydney time, so we had to stay up for at least a few more hours. The lights came up, and I took advantage of the chance to explore the rest of the plane.\n\nJust behind the business-class mini-cabin were a few rows of Qantas\u2019 premium economy. I spent some time in the seats, and was very impressed.\n\nSome airlines\u2019 premium economy products are basically the same as coach, just with slightly larger seats and slightly better food. These seats, though, were a lot different to a standard economy seat. One Qantas employee described them as \u201cmore of a level below the full business class, rather than a small improvement on coach\u201d, and based on some time in the seat, I think that\u2019s a fair assessment.\n\nA crucial aspect is the leg rest, which shockingly few premium economy products offer.\n\nWhen it\u2019s extended and the seat is reclined, it\u2019s actually quite comfortable. There\u2019s a net beyond the leg rest which serves as a comfortable foot rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a decent amount of legroom, or pitch, as well. Even when the seat in front of you is reclined, it does so at an angle where there\u2019s still plenty of room for your knees.\n\nThe economy cabin is closer to the standard product you\u2019d expect, but it has a couple little tweaks that help make a long flight more bearable \u2014 although 20 hours in one of these seats would certainly be tough.\n\nQantas CEO Alan Joyce, who was on board the flight, said that although the eventual flight would have an economy cabin \u2013 compared with Singapore Airlines' 18-hour Singapore-New York flight, which is operated by a plane with just premium economy and business class \u2013 the airline is looking at ways to make it bearable for an ultra-long-haul flight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome options, he said, include spacing the seats out to offer more leg room, as well as pulling some seats out to create a communal area for passengers to spend time during the flight. They could sit and chat in this space, stretch, or simply stand up for a few minutes to keep the blood moving.\n\nCarl Petch, one of the passengers involved in the research study, said that an area like that would be crucial for making it through the ultra-long-haul flight in economy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d need a communal area to walk around, or do work, or something,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit for 20 straight hours.\u201d\n\nHaving fewer seats seems like it could be cost-prohibitive, but it may actually be a necessity. A low-density configuration will probably be required to boost the plane's fuel range so it can reach its destination without stopping to refuel.\n\nJoyce also noted consistently positive ratings from passengers on the airline\u2019s nonstop flight between Perth and London, which, at over 17 hours, is only a little shorter than the Project Sunrise flights.\n\nEconomy seats have about 32 inches (81cm) of pitch, which is on the higher side of standard for long-haul aeroplanes.\n\nEconomy seats also have an adapted version of the premium economy footrest, which was definitely an improvement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flight menu offered a description of the full service schedule.\n\nHere\u2019s the full 'flight plan'.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the full menu \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2026 along with a description of the rationale for the food options\n\nFor the first course \u2014 essentially a late lunch, Sydney time \u2014 I started with the spicy tomato and saffron soup with Gruy\u00e8re croutons. It was fabulous, not too spicy, but enough so that it was flavourful \u2014 and definitely helped me wake up. Reminder: the flight began operating on Sydney time (noon-ish) after we took off from JFK just before 9.30pm ET, so this New Yorker was feeling ready for bed.\n\nFor the main course, I had the chicken breast with Spanish rice, kale, tomatillo sauce, and pepita salsa. This was genuinely phenomenal; I was blown away by how tasty it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was also genuinely impressed that the chef and cabin crew could put together something so tasty in such a small, cramped galley \u2014 even though much of it, obviously, was prepared before the flight.\n\nHere are the individual ovens used to prepare everyone\u2019s dishes \u2026\n\n\u2026 and the order sheet the crew used to keep track of everyone\u2019s orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tiny little galley was a flurry of activity, basically a fully functional kitchen in the sky.\n\nA little while after the first meal, Dr Marie Carroll, the researcher leading the passenger jet-lag study, brought all of the participating passengers to the empty rear galley for a short group exercise, including stretches and squats.\n\nDr. Carroll described moving during flight as a crucial part of mitigating jet-lag symptoms after ultra-long-haul flights. Eventually, other passengers and crew came over to participate, so the group moved into the aisles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Alan Joyce, Qantas\u2019 CEO, joined in the exercises. It turned into something of a party, with Dr Carroll playing 'Macarena' over the PA system and leading a dance. Truly a unique experience.\n\nThis would obviously be impossible on a normal flight, although Joyce said that the communal area he envisions on future ultra long haul flights could offer short guided stretch and exercise videos on monitors.\n\nAfter the exercise party, I was getting quite tired. After all, it was two in the morning back in New York, and I had been up since a little before 7am. However, following Dr Carroll\u2019s advice \u2014 and not wanting to miss anything \u2014 I powered through, starting to process photos from earlier in the flight on my laptop.\n\nAt about 3.30am New York time, or 6.30pm Sydney time, the flight attendants took our orders for the second meal \u2014 'dinner' \u2014 and they came through to fit mattress pads onto our seats. 'That way, you can go to sleep as soon as dinner\u2019s finished.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI started with a small bowl of the roasted sweet potato soup with nutmeg cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Like the first meal, it was fantastic and flavourful, but definitely more of a sleep-inducing comfort food.\n\nThe chicken and Swiss cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato, and herb mayo, also hit the spot.\n\nThe dessert, though \u2014 panna cotta trifle with raspberries and toasted almonds \u2014 was the star. I devoured it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, finally, it was bedtime. A handy button on the seat control panel turned the chair into a bed in about 30 seconds.\n\nThere was plenty of space in the footwell to be able to turn over comfortably, and the mattress pad made it quite comfortable.\n\nI slept for an astonishing eight hours and thirty minutes, my best-ever sleep on a plane, even in first or business class. I woke up once or twice because of turbulence or to use the lavatory, but I was still blown away by how well I slept, even considering how tired I was by that point.\n\nFor those lucky enough to be in first or business class, this strikes me as the ultimate advantage of an ultra-long-haul nonstop flight, compared with one with a stop \u2013 there\u2019s more time to settle in, and eventually sleep without interruption.\n\nNick Mole, one of the participants in the passenger research study, expressed similar sentiments towards the end of the flight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Mole often flies in business class, but said he generally feels better rested after an ultra-long-haul direct flight, rather than one with a connection, including Qantas\u2019 service to New York via Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI feel better than I usually do,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe timing and service helped, and I got some good uninterrupted sleep.\u201d\n\nDaniel Brescia, another passenger, agreed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m curious to see how the jet lag feels in a day or two, though,\u201d he added.\n\nA few minutes after I woke up, warm-toned lighting gradually enveloped the cabin. It was almost time for sunrise for this Project Sunrise flight.\n\nGradually, I \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 stirred and woke, and the cabin crew kicked into action with breakfast. They kindly took our orders earlier in the flight, so that they could get breakfast ready right after we arose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI started with the wild berry granola, a cold-pressed green juice, and, most importantly, a coffee.\n\nFor my main, I had the egg, bacon, and herb tart (basically a quiche) with caramelised onion relish. Like everything else I ate during the flight, it was perfect.\n\nBy the time we finished breakfast, the sun was fully up, and it was time to prepare for the end of our journey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe entered Australian airspace at just about 5am Sydney time.\n\nCaptain Lisa Norman, the pilot who took delivery of the plane and flew it to New York for the Project Sunrise flight, said that Australian air-traffic control sent a text message to the flight crew as they entered the airspace: \u201cGood morning. Hope everyone is still feeling fresh and comfortable.\u201d\n\nThe pilots replied: \u201cSunrise is dawning on Research Flight 1. Feeling good and fresh. Thanks.\u201d\n\nIt was pretty incredible to see the long journey coming to an end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we approached the Australian coast, the pilot-in-charge, Captain Sean Golding, came over the PA to point out a small speck to our right: QF12, the Qantas flight that goes from New York to Sydney, but stops in Los Angeles on the way.\n\nQF12 would land three minutes after us \u2013 despite leaving New York three hours earlier.\n\nCaptain Golding also said that based on the approach pattern we were given, there would be great views of Sydney Harbour on the left side of the plane. Thanks to the fact that the flight was mostly empty, those of us seated on the right and in the centre were able to grab spare window seats on the left.\n\nAnd wow, was he telling the truth. As we approached, we got incredible views of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2026 and more views as we looped around to line up with the runway.\n\nWe landed at 7.43am Sydney time, 19 hours and 16 minutes after leaving runway 31L at JFK.\n\nIt was certainly the most festive disembarkation I\u2019ve experienced. Here is the entire flight crew, plus the passenger research study participants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter more than 19 hours in the air, here\u2019s what I thought:\n\nI felt better after this flight than I\u2019ve ever felt after a long-haul flight, including those on which I was lucky enough to sit in a first or business-class cabin with a lie-flat seat. On 15-hour flights to Seoul and Tokyo, I\u2019ve landed feeling utterly exhausted, while on shorter seven or eight-hour flights to Europe, by the time I manage to digest, relax, and fall asleep, it\u2019s practically already time to land.\n\nFor obvious reasons, I won\u2019t bother comparing the Project Sunrise experience with ultra-long-haul flights when I\u2019ve been in economy. The longest I\u2019ve ever done there was about 18 hours, although that included an hour-long refuelling stop during which we could stretch our legs. Also, I was a kid back then.\n\nI think that Qantas is onto something with this technique of immediately switching time zones, tailoring lighting, meal options, and service flow around sleep, and promoting healthy actions like stretching, staying awake until evening in the destination\u2019s time zone, and suggesting limiting alcohol before the second meal.\n\nThere\u2019s also something undeniably pleasant about being able to fly somewhere direct \u2013 especially when it saves as much as three hours, as we did compared with the QF12 flight.\n\nHowever, I simply can\u2019t imagine a flight this long in economy with the current configuration and a full load of passengers. Joyce\u2019s discussion of adding pitch and a communal area makes me hopeful; this is something that Qantas will have to figure out if it wants to offer a full three or four-cabin configuration if and when the nonstop New York-to-Sydney route officially goes into service.\n\nThis story first appeared in Business Insider.
