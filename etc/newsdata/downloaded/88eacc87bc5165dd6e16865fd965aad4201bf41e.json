Mexican army personnel previously transferred the four kidnappers to a jail in the municipality of Guadalupe y Calvo, located approximately 290 miles south of the state capital.\n\nWithin hours of the transfer, cartel gunmen arrived and entered the installation to free the four prisoners. Investigators are trying to determine if members of the Guadalupe y Calvo municipal police or other agencies assisted in the escape. Police launched a major operation led by ministerial agents of the state prosecutor\u2019s office and army personnel.\n\nGuadalupe y Calvo is located in the southern section of the state and is well known for a heavy cartel presence.
