Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAlthough the Massachusetts senator\u2019s edge falls within the survey\u2019s margin of error, Biden\u2019s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support.\n\nThe latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday\u2019s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.\n\n\u201cAfter trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,\u201d Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said in a statement. \u201cWe now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they\u2019re leaving the rest of the pack behind.\u201d\n\nWarren also bested Biden in a poll released Saturday of likely Iowa caucus-goers, 22 percent to 20 percent, as well as in a poll released Tuesday of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, 27 percent to 25 percent. The two candidates were statistically tied in both surveys.\n\nThe new Quinnipiac poll comes after Warren\u2019s campaign announced on Tuesday an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million. The survey is the most recent to show Biden backsliding from his once secure status as the Democratic front-runner \u2014 with diminishing support in the early contests crucial to determining the trajectory of the broader primary race.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University national poll was conducted Sept. 19-23, surveying 561 Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.", "description": "The Massachusetts senator leads the former vice president by two percent.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wum2yu8Q8Eg2Tt0NLe8GZg--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/a87a14987decb7f5a03d42ae96b636b6", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
