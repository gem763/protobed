Some 300 million people play the game in China, NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum said in an interview with Reuters earlier this month.\n\n- The NBA has had a presence in China since 1992 when it opened its first office in Hong Kong. It now has relationships with a number of television and digital media outlets throughout China, including a three-decade partnership with CCTV, the league said.\n\n- The Houston Rockets are widely followed in China after the franchise drafted Chinese player Yao Ming with the first overall pick in the 2002 draft. Yao became a star and helped build the NBA\u2019s following in China. The eight-time NBA All-Star was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\n- NBA China, which conducts the league\u2019s business in the country, was launched in 2008. It is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n- Since 2014, 17 NBA teams have played 26 games in Beijing, Guangzhou, Macao, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Taipei. Los Angeles Lakers, led by four-time NBA MVP LeBron James, will play a pair of exhibition games against the Brooklyn Nets in China in October.\n\n- The NBA and Tencent, a Chinese media outlet which provides a live streaming platform, announced a five-year extension of a partnership through the 2024-25 season. The deal is worth a reported $1.5 billion while Tencent has estimated that there are about 500 million fans in China consuming NBA content, ESPN reported.\n\n- NBA franchises gained 47 million new followers on Chinese social media platforms during the 2018-19 season, according to the league\u2019s annual report on teams\u2019 digital performance.", "description": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) came under fire on Monday for its response to a tweet by a Houston Rockets official supporting protests calling for democracy in the Chinese-ruled city of Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
