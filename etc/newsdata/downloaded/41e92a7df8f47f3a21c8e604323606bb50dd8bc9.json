The campaign and the Republican National Committee has also already dumped over $300,000 on the ads in the state fighting back against impeachment leading up to Thursday\u2019s rally, according to Federal Communications Commission filings.\n\nAnadolu Agency via Getty Images, FILE\n\nMinnesota represents a unique testing ground for a campaign fighting hard to prove it can not only flip the state next year but turn impeachment into an asset for the president.\n\nAnd the campaign has already proved, at least early on, it can at least turn impeachment into cash \u2014 spending millions fundraising off Democrats' newly launched inquiry in late September, and bringing in $8.5 million in the first 48 hours \u2014 50,000 of which came from new donors, according to the campaign.\n\nThursday\u2019s rally will also provide a slew of opportunities for the president to not only go on offense against his favorite 2020 Democratic targets like former Vice President Joe Biden who\u2019s also engulfed in Trump's Ukraine scandal, but also Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar and Mayor Jacob Frey\u2014who Trump\u2019s already clashed with over a security fee dispute leading up to the campaign rally.\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nOmar, who months earlier was on the receiving end of racist attacks from not only the president, who told the congresswoman and three of her peers to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, but also from Trump supporters at a rally in July whose chants of \u201csend her back\u201d were aimed at the Somali refugee who became a US citizen.\n\n\u201cTrump will see his rally in my district today as an opportunity to attack me,\u201d Omar preemptively tweeted hours before Thursday\u2019s rally. \u201cBut no smear will ever stop me from working toward what I\u2019m in Congress to do,\u201d the congresswoman added, listing off a number of goals she hopes to achieve including \u201cimpeach Trump.", "description": "President Trump brings his campaign roadshow to a state he nearly won in 2016 when he rallies in Minnesota on Thursday as Democrats push impeachment.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-election-getty-aa-191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
