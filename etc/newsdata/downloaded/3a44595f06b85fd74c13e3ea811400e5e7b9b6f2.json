I currently live in Connecticut, where taxes are quite high, and am looking for a less expensive place that is also warmer.\n\nI have cash assets of about $900,000 and another maybe $200,000 in equity in my house (but I might want to keep the house for rental income). I\u2019d like my main source of retirement income to be my Social Security of about $26,300 a year.\n\nI want to travel, so I don\u2019t want to spend a lot on housing, and I would like a small city, no more than 30 minutes from the Atlantic Ocean. I\u2019d also like a city that\u2019s two hours or less by car from an international airport. It would be great if the city has a college or university and/or a mixed population including retirees. Any great ideas?\n\nThank you,\n\nMAM\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Dear MAM,\n\nYou\u2019re part of a big trend: People getting the heck out of the Northeast for cheaper living and warmer weather \u2014 many of them to the South. And while the South has its downsides, like sweltering summers, you\u2019ll certainly be able to find a reduced cost of living, mostly mild weather for many months of the year, and plenty of good food and culture.\n\nWondering where to spend your golden years? Email Catey Hill at chill@marketwatch.com with your wish list, and she\u2019ll recommend spots for you. Letters may be edited for clarity and length. Look for MarketWatch reader suggestions in the comments.\n\nThat said, it may be a bit of a struggle to live solely on your Social Security \u2014 at least if you want a compelling city right by the coast. But if you\u2019re also getting some rental income from your home, you should be able to do it, while also using some of your savings for travel. With that in mind, here are some affordable spots near the ocean that should meet most of your criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalm Coast, Fla.\n\niStock A couple walls along a beach in Florida near Palm Coast.\n\nNestled between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach, this under-the-radar Florida retirement spot \u2014 which sits on 70-plus miles of canals and the Intracoastal Waterway \u2014 proves that \u201cFlorida still can be an inexpensive place to live,\u201d Annette Fuller, the editor of Where to Retire magazine, tells MarketWatch.\n\nThe cost of living is roughly average for the U.S. Median homes in Palm Coast cost around $215,000 (with property taxes that are lower than average for the U.S.), and the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is under $1,000, according to Sperling\u2019s Best Places. (Fuller adds that there is \u201clots of active-adult housing\u201d in the region.) Another perk in Florida: You\u2019ll avoid income tax.\n\nResidents often come to the area for the Atlantic beaches, but in Palm Coast they find lots of outdoor activities, too, including \u201ctennis, golf, pickleball and even croquet,\u201d Fuller says. Palm Coast has more than 125 miles of walking and biking paths, as well as fishing and boating. And bird watching is also popular here, especially at St. Joe Walkway and Linear Park.\n\nRelated: People who live on the coast are typically happier than those who don\u2019t\n\nOther things to check off your list: There are plenty of fellow retirees here, and you can get to the Daytona International Airport in a little over a half-hour by car.\n\nNow for some downsides: Summers are hot and humid, there\u2019s a risk of hurricanes, and some residents complain about the rapid growth and sprawl of the area. Plus, if you want to cut costs further, there are cheaper places to retire in the Sunshine State (especially if you\u2019re willing to look inland).\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nPopulation: 82,350\n\nJanuary low/July high: 45\u00b0F/90\u00b0F\n\nSource: Sperling\u2019s Best Places\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Summerville, S.C.\n\niStock Nearby Charleston is a draw for residents of Summerville, S.C.\n\nThis small city roughly 25 miles from Charleston recently landed on Forbes\u2019 list of the best places to retire, with the publication highlighting its mild winters, above-average air quality, low rate of serious crimes and \u201csufficient physicians per capita.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s affordable: The cost of living is \u201cat national average,\u201d Forbes notes, and Social Security income is not taxed in South Carolina. A median home can be had for about $215,000, with property taxes lower than the U.S. average. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment averages under $1,000 a month.\n\nSummerville is notable for its greenery. Its streets are lined with gorgeous azaleas and towering pines. It\u2019s also bursting with history: Part of the town is on the National Register of Historic Places. And it\u2019s got plenty of that Southern flavor to go around: Summerville claims to be the birthplace of sweet tea, and Southern Living recently wrote of it: \u201cThe best two places in the world to enjoy sweet tea this summer are: 1. Your front porch; and 2. Summerville, South Carolina.\u201d Plus, you\u2019re close to Charleston, which is renowned for its excellent food and robust culture, has an international airport and is a college town.\n\nThe biggest downside for you might be that you\u2019re a little over your desired half-hour from the popular Atlantic Ocean beaches (for example, Folly Beach is about a 45-minute drive from Summerville). But maybe the proximity to Charleston and the relative affordability of Summerville make up for that.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nPopulation: 49,000\n\nJanuary low/July high: 35\u00b0F/90\u00b0F\n\nSource: Sperling\u2019s Best Places\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Brunswick, Ga., area\n\niStock A home in Brunswick.\n\nWhile St. Simon\u2019s, Jekyll Island and Sea Island (which make up the so-called Golden Isles) garner most of the attention in the area, Brunswick \u2014 the mainland gateway to those islands \u2014 gives you access to their amazing beaches at a fraction of the cost. The cost of living is significantly below average for the U.S., with the median home to be had for less than $140,000. Social Security income is exempt from Georgia\u2019s state income tax.\n\nDowntown Brunswick is known for its historic Victorian-era architecture (it was named a Main Street City by the National Trust for Historic Preservation) and has more than a dozen historic squares. Plus, you\u2019ll find a smattering of local shops, art galleries, restaurants and more in this town of roughly 16,000 people \u2014 as well as performances at the historic Ritz Theatre.\n\nOutdoor activities like bird watching are big here, as Brunswick is surrounded by saltwater marshes. And the Golden Isles are renowned for golf and miles of beaches. Plus, the Golden Isles have a unique vibe \u2014 a \u201cblend of formality and down-home ease,\u201d Travel & Leisure writes. And Where to Retire magazine, which listed Brunswick/Golden Isles among its where-to-retire picks, writes of the area: \u201cUnlike typical touristy East Coach beach towns, Georgia\u2019s Brunswick and the Golden Isles are more sedate, with a focus on preservation.\u201d\n\nBrunswick is also a college town \u2014 the College of Coastal Georgia is here \u2014 that\u2019s roughly an hour from Jacksonville, Fla., which has an international airport; and there\u2019s a hospital in town (the Southeast Georgia Health System).\n\nOne downside is that crime here is higher than average (though there are statistically safer neighborhoods and towns in the area to live in, as you can see from this map).\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nPopulation: 16,000\n\nJanuary low/July high: 42\u00b0F/91\u00b0F\n\nSource: Sperling\u2019s Best Place", "description": "A retirement near the beach can be had for less than you might think.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS358_palm_ZG_20190930203917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
