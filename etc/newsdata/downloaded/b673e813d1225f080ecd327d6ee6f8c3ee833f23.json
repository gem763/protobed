It was the third time in five tournaments they had exited at the group stage, one of the historic powerhouses of the game laid low by a combination of administrative incompetence and incoherence.\n\nAs his reign nears its end, Wales no longer have faces the colour of their jerseys. The record in the Gatland years of three grand slams equals the number in the golden era of the 1970s, but whereas the job of coaches then was to polish diamonds at a time when the country produced some of the greatest players of their generation, the supply line has trickled.\n\nThe regional system, introduced in 2003, has been a slow-burn and Gatland has often promoted players who were not regular starters for their regions: think Sam Warburton and, this month, Rhys Carr\u00e9, the World Cup bolter among bolters. He sculpts his players out of granite and there is a hardness and solidity to Wales now where there was before a tendency to collapse. The very least they add up to is the sum of their parts with Gatland able to get everything out of everyone.\n\nEight years ago, they reached the semi-finals. In 2015, they got out of a pool that included the hosts, England, and Australia, but fell narrowly to South Africa in the last eight. Wales\u2019 inability to create in tight matches cost them, but so did a crippling injury list.\n\nBefore they left for Japan, they were without the injured Taulupe Faletau and Gareth Anscombe and were unable to pick Toulon\u2019s Rhys Webb because of a policy which stipulates that anyone playing outside the country must have reached 60 caps. They all play in positions that form the spine of the team, but while Wales have become used to Faletau\u2019s absence and Dan Biggar is an experienced alternative to Anscombe, Wales miss the rounded game of Webb. Scrum-half is the position where they look short.\n\nWales do not have the strongest team on paper nor the depth of some others, they have fewer nailed-on certainties than at any time this decade. They are supremely conditioned, confident they can trump opponents in the final quarter of a match. They can defend a lead or play catch-up. And they finally defeated their group rivals Australia last year.\n\nGatland wants to bow out with a flourish. His successor, Wayne Pivac, will be in Japan, watching from a distance before taking over in November. He will profit from at least one of Gatland\u2019s legacies. Wales tended to sack coaches in the year before a World Cup (1990, 1995, 1998 and 2006) and the turning point for Gatland came at the end of 2010 when the sheen of the grand slam success two years before had worn off, results were disappointing and Ryan Jones was stripped of the captaincy after a draw at home to Fiji.\n\nFormer internationals took to the airwaves and newspaper columns to demand that Gatland be sacked. The Welsh Rugby Union, finally learning from the mistakes of the past, held firm. A laughing stock for once took stock and the result was not just a grand slam in 2012 and the Six Nations title 12 months later, but a sustained period of success that has allowed Welsh supporters to look forward to a tournament they used to dread.", "description": "Hardness and solidity mark out Warren Gatland\u2019s side but injuries and absences leave them exposed", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c48b179271b15e2dc351270add50804d53e33fd1/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5fd89d00edd36a58907365b738133c4e", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
