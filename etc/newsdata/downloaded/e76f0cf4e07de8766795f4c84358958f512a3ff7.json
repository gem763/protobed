It was November, 14, 2015, and the Rugby Football Union\u2019s then chief executive had travelled to Cape Town, making sure his arrival on a British Airways flight from Heathrow had gone unreported.\n\nAs he arrived at a faceless meeting room at Cape Town\u2019s Table Bay Hotel, he glanced out of the window and was confronted by the looming presence of Table Mountain. Not that Ritchie had time for sightseeing: instead, the view was a reminder of the suitably monumental task that was facing him in South Africa \u2013 persuading Eddie Jones to take over England\u2019s head coach.\n\nForty-two days earlier, England had been humiliatingly dumped out of their own World Cup following defeats by Wales and Australia in the pool stage. The recriminations had been long and bitter, leading ultimately to Stuart Lancaster\u2019s departure as coach. Only days earlier Jones, who had just started his new job as head coach of the Western Stormers \u2013 Cape Town\u2019s Super Rugby franchise \u2013 had dismissed speculation linking him to the England post. By way of explanation, he observed: \u201cI look out on to Table Mountain and think of how lucky I am to be here.\u201d\n\nAnd yet here was Ritchie, exhausted from his 6,000-mile journey and now anxiously waiting for Jones to arrive and discover if he could fulfil the task he had been set by the RFU board \u2013 convincing the Australian to swap the Cape for Twickenham.\n\nSince England\u2019s World Cup exit and Lancaster\u2019s departure, Ritchie had conducted significant due diligence on potential successors and Jones had been the outstanding candidate. All the research confirmed that England needed a proven world-class coach, having endured successive World Cup disappointments under relatively inexperienced home-grown head coaches in Martin Johnson and Lancaster.", "description": "The inside story of 'scary Eddie's' battles to make his team World Cup contenders", "authors": ["Daniel Schofield", "Jonathan Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-union/2019/09/26/a2bd6a4d-9017-4f5c-9dbc-268a3cd0745d-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
