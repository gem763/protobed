The U.S. women's team was criticized by some for celebrating late goals during a 13-0 rout of Thailand at the World Cup in June.\n\nThe Nations League, a new tournament for teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean, has relatively low stakes but provides additional competitive matches, though former U.S. coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann called them \"a waste of time\" because it forces regional powers to meet weaker nations. The Americans play 75th-ranked Canada at Toronto on Tuesday, an important match for the hosts as they try to climb in the FIFA rankings and earn a spot in the hexagonal that will determine the three direct berths of the North and Central American and Caribbean region for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nThe U.S., which stopped three-game winless streak, finished one goal shy of its record for goals and victory margin. The Americans are 11-1-1 against Cuba, winning 11 straight matchups for their longest victory streak against an opponent.\n\nMcKennie banged home a cross from Morris from 8 yards just 32 seconds in, the second-fastest U.S. goal after Clint Dempsey's score at 30 seconds against Ghana at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nUnited States' Weston McKennie, left, is congratulated by Christian Pulisic (10) after scoring a goal on Cuba in the first minute of the first half of a CONCACAF Nations League soccer match Friday, Oct. 11, 2019, in Washington.
