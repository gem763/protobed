Her outfit choices have been a point of tension with her parents in recent weeks. (Cheryl Diaz Meyer for The Washington Post)\n\nTeenagers, especially girls, have long clashed with their parents over the outfits they wear to school. Parents have called out their daughters for wearing a shirt that\u2019s too tight, a skirt that\u2019s too short, a dress that\u2019s too revealing.\n\nBut many high school girls are pushing back against these restrictions in the name of female empowerment, forcing parents to rethink how they talk about the way their daughters dress.\n\nIn the age of \u201cbody positivity\u201d and campaigns against \u201cslut-shaming,\u201d how do parents navigate conversations about teenage girls and their clothing choices?\n\n[Read the story: Is a crop top empowering for girls? Parents try to navigate what\u2019s \u2018appropriate\u2019 dress for teen girls]\n\n\u201cParents that consider themselves to be progressive can feel very stymied in these conversations,\u201d said Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist and author of \u201cUnder Pressure,\u201d a book about anxiety in girls.\n\nPerhaps most important is what not to say, Damour said. She urged parents to avoid bringing shame into the conversation with words like \u201cslutty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat teenage girls almost invariably hear is, \u2018You think I\u2019m a slut,\u2019\u201d Damour said.\n\nParents should not imply that a teenage daughter is \u201csomehow responsible for regulating the male gaze.\u201d Don\u2019t focus the conversation on how a girl\u2019s outfit might make her male peers or teachers uncomfortable in school, she said.\n\n\u201cShaming your child is not helpful and it\u2019s not going to make you feel better,\u201d and it might make a teenager dig her heels in more, said Joyce McFadden, a psychoanalyst and author on how to talk to girls about their sexuality. \u201cRather than saying, \u2018That\u2019s a slutty thing to wear,\u2019 say, \u2018Is school the place you want to wear that?\u2019\u201d\n\nMothers can try using examples from their own lives, with comments such as, \u201cThose don\u2019t look like school clothes any more than I would wear a cocktail dress to work,\u201d Damour said.\n\nInstead of criticizing or judging the girl for her clothing choices, parents should instead try to ask questions about why she wants to wear a certain outfit, McFadden said. Open the door to a broader conversation about her style and what she\u2019s hoping to get across.\n\n\u201cWhat they think is their agency might really not be their agency. It might be something that oppresses them,\u201d McFadden said.\n\nThese desires are often complicated by the expectations of girls on Instagram and other social media platforms where teens seek validation based on the way they look.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say a girl is taking a selfie and she wants to express something, but what really is it that she wants to express?\u201d McFadden said. \u201cFeeling body pride is fine. Spending 15 minutes curating an image of yourself in a bikini with your stomach sucked in, standing in a pose you would never stand in otherwise, that\u2019s not body positivity. That\u2019s conforming to a societal expectation for you, for sexiness.\u201d\n\nMcFadden emphasizes the importance of teaching girls to think critically about their choices, so they can distinguish between what they actually want and what \u201cculture is feeding them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach your girls that they can discern between those two things so they can more authentically actualize their agency,\u201d she said.\n\nThe conversation will be messy, but parents should fumble through it, both experts said. They should try to convey that self-expression is important and acknowledge when certain dress codes and rules are arbitrary, sexist or unfair, McFadden said.\n\nAnd remember that any debate over clothing with a teenager might be a losing battle. At the end of the conversation, your daughter is very likely to walk out the door wearing whatever she wants to wear. And that\u2019s okay.\n\n\u201cAt some level, this is pretty low-stakes stuff. A crop top isn\u2019t heroin. \u2026 We\u2019re talking about a decision that can be made and unmade in a day,\u201d Damour said. \u201cWhere this can go best is for adults to use it as grounds for conversation around questions of empowerment and objectification and who\u2019s calling the shots.\u201d", "description": "In the age of \u201cbody positivity\u201d and campaigns against \u201cslut-shaming,\u201d how do parents navigate conversations about teenage girls and their clothing choices?", "authors": ["Samantha Schmidt", "Reporter Covering Gender", "Family Issues", "October At Pm", "Samantha Schmidt Is A Reporter Covering Gender", "Family Issues."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MH8St0MxlI1RQauPKUuqXW24BMs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GUUMWMG7XUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
