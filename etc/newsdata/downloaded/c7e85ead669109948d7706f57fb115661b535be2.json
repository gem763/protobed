TIME has obtained a photograph of the incident.\n\nThe photograph has not been previously reported. The picture was taken at an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d-themed gala. It shows Trudeau, then the 29-year-old son of the late former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, wearing a turban and robes with his face, neck and hands completely darkened. The photograph appears in the 2000-2001 yearbook of West Point Grey Academy, a private day school where Trudeau was a teacher.\n\nEarlier this month, TIME obtained a copy of the yearbook, The View, with the photograph of Trudeau in brownface from Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson, who was part of the West Point Grey Academy community. Adamson was not at the party, which was attended by school faculty, administrators and parents of students. He said that he first saw the photograph in July and felt it should be made public.\n\nThe yearbook from the 2000/2001 school year at West Point Grey Academy shows several people, some of whom are still on staff at the school, dressed up for the gala\u2014however only Trudeau appears to have darkened his skin. | TIME More\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday night, following TIME\u2019s publication of the photo, Trudeau apologized: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have known better and I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d When asked if he thought the photograph was racist, he said, \u201cYes it was. I didn\u2019t consider it racist at the time, but now we know better.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said he wore blackface \u201cmakeup\u201d in high school to sing \u201cDay-O,\u201d a Jamaican folk song famously performed by African-American singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte. \u201cI deeply regret that I did that,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zita Astravas, the media relations lead of the Liberal Party of Canada, which Trudeau is the leader of, confirmed that the prime minister was in the photo. \u201cIt was a photo taken while he was teaching in Vancouver, at the school\u2019s annual dinner which had a costume theme of \u2018Arabian Nights.\u2019 He attended with friends and colleagues dressed as a character from Aladdin,\u201d said Astravas. Trudeau is planning on addressing the photograph to the media later this evening, according to the Astravas. The prime minister\u2019s official director of communications did not return multiple calls.\n\nThis is a critical moment for Trudeau, who began his re-election campaign on Sept. 11 under the cloud of a scandal over whether he pressured his then-attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large Canadian engineering firm. The Liberal Party leader has championed minority groups during his nearly four years as prime minister and made his embrace of Canada\u2019s many cultures a major part of his leadership. At least seven of the 35 members of Trudeau\u2019s cabinet are from ethnic minorities.\n\nTrudeau has previously garnered regular media attention in the Canadian and global press for his choice of attire. In 2018, he was mocked for the elaborate Indian garb that he, his wife and their three children wore during a visit to India.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and wife Sophie Gregoire pay their respects at the SSikh Golden Temple in Amritsar on Feb. 21, 2018. | Narinder Nanu\u2014AFP/Getty Images More", "description": "Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, wore brownface makeup to a party at the private school where he taught in 2001, a photo obtained by TIME shows", "authors": ["Anna Purna Kambhampaty"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZLwc.OzCj8UqPDSBSA0hqQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/5a5d63b54820e83ee9877debcfce126e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
