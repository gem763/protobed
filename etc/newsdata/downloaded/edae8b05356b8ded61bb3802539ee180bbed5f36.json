Today they didn't,\" he said.\n\nDE JONG EASES BURDEN OF PRICE TAG\n\nSevilla's Luuk de Jong was in danger of becoming a laughing stock after the 15-million-euro ($16.74 million) signing from PSV Eindhoven had failed to score in his first seven matches despite firing 20 shots at goal.\n\nThe Dutchman, the joint-top scorer in the Eredivisie last season, finally delivered when his team needed him the most, however, coming off the bench and netting the only goal in a 1-0 win at home to Levante.\n\n\"It meant to so much to him,\" said team mate Lucas Ocampos.\n\nGRANADA PERFECT ART OF GRINDING OUT WINS\n\nPromoted Granada continued to turn heads by moving up to third in the La Liga standings after beating Osasuna 1-0 on Friday and a pattern is beginning to emerge for their opponents: you're in trouble if you concede first.\n\nDiego Gonzalez's side, who beat champions Barcelona 2-0 last month, have scored the first goal in five games this season and have gone on to win every single time.
