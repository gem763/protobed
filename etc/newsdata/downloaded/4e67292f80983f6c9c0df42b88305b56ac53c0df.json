REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nFacebook, which has been under scrutiny from regulators after U.S. intelligence agencies found that Russia used social media platforms to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, recently changed the wording of its rules on political ads, which used to ban \u201cdeceptive, false or misleading content.\u201d\n\nIts new online policy prohibits \u201cads that include claims debunked by third-party fact checkers or, in certain circumstances, claims debunked by organizations with particular expertise,\u201d but this has led some to point out that politicians\u2019 ads and posts are exempt from Facebook\u2019s fact-checking program.\n\nWarren, a Democratic frontrunner who in March called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, argued in her tweets that the public needs to know how Facebook intends to use its influence in the November 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Trump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about?\u201d she tweeted, referring to a Sept. 19 meeting.\n\n\u201cAfter that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on \u2018misinformation\u2019 in ads,\u201d she asked. \u201cPut another way, Facebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies,\u201d she added.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman said the update to its external ad policy page had not changed its policy or enforcement.\n\nThe Warren campaign and Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nUsing an example of a Trump campaign Facebook ad that said Democrats wanted to repeal the Second Amendment, Warren argued that Facebook was allowing Trump to mislead the public.\n\nFactCheck.org director Eugene Kiely, whose organization is one of Facebook\u2019s independent fact-checking partners and which has called Trump\u2019s Second Amendment ads \u201cdeceptive,\u201d said he thinks Facebook users should see related fact-checking stories next to political ads.\n\nIn her Monday tweets, Warren also referenced leaked audio of an internal Facebook Q&A session in which Zuckerberg talked about what a Warren presidency could mean for the company.\n\nShe said Facebook was \u201ctaking deliberate steps to help one candidate intentionally mislead the American people, while painting the candidacy of others (specifically: mine) as an \u2018existential\u2019 threat.\u201d\n\nTrump has frequently criticized social media platforms for alleged bias against conservatives, a claim the companies deny.", "description": "U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren took aim at Facebook's political advertising policies on Monday, suggesting without evidence that a change in the social media giant's policy might have been linked to a recent meeting between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438537609&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971HB", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
