Photo: Peter Summers/Getty Images\n\nWhat a banner week for President Trump and his friends. Police arrested two of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s close associates over alleged campaign finance violations. The House subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry in connection with its impeachment inquiry. The administration\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, announced on Friday that he\u2019ll testify before the House, despite White House orders not to appear. As is customary, Trump has instigated such a chaotic news cycle that some newsworthy moments get lost in the churn. But one such incident is worth closer scrutiny.\n\nIn August, the wife of an American diplomat struck and killed a British teenager with her car. As the Daily Beast reported earlier this week, the woman, Anne Sacoolas, hit Harry Dunn with her luxury Volvo not far from a Royal Air Force base in Croughton, England. Sacoolas had pulled out of the base on the wrong side of the road; the impact sent Dunn flying from the seat of his motorbike, and he died later the same day. Though Sacoolas initially assured local police that she would not leave the country, she and her family did just that, claiming diplomatic immunity. They\u2019re now back in the U.S., and the British aren\u2019t too pleased.\n\nThough it\u2019s not clear if Sacoolas really has full immunity \u2014 the Daily Beast says that her husband isn\u2019t a registered diplomat \u2014 British authorities have asked the U.S. to formally waive it anyway. Trump, however, seems unlikely to agree. On October 9, the president accidentally revealed private briefing notes ahead of a meeting with British prime minister Boris Johnson. Visible from a distance, the notes make it clear that the U.S. would refuse to return Sacoolas to the U.K.:\n\n\u201cI hate the case,\u201d Trump told reporters later, adding, \u201cThe woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen. You know, those are opposite roads.\u201d Asked directly if he would agree to send Sacoolas back to the U.K., Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to speak to her and see what we can come up with so that there can be some healing.\u201d That\u2019s going to be difficult, since Dunn\u2019s parents are fairly unequivocal about what they want from the U.S. and their own government. \u201cOur position is that she doesn\u2019t have immunity and that waivers are always granted in these circumstances,\u201d Radd Seiger, an attorney for the family, told The Independent. Seiger said the family may also file a civil case against Sacoolas in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to understand why Sacoolas would flee the U.K; presumably, she was trying to save her own skin, ethics and legal responsibilities be damned. But Trump\u2019s position is a bit more confusing. The president has no obvious reason to protect an American driver who killed a teenager because she forgot she was in a different country. Johnson and Trump have a number of similarities and shared interests, but it seems their newfound friendship has its limits.\n\nPerhaps Trump\u2019s motivations have nothing to do with Sacoolas, or Johnson, and more to do with his perception of the U.S. and its role in the world. Trump revels in his power, considers himself unaccountable to anyone, and perceives the U.S., as an extension of himself, to be entitled to the same privileges. It doesn\u2019t matter who Sacoolas is, or who she killed, or where she killed him. She\u2019s an American, and to Trump, maybe that\u2019s all that matters.", "description": "Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a U.S. diplomat, hit and killed Harry Dunn, a 19-year-old British teen, with her car.
