I\u2019m looking at investing in vacant land through my self-managed super fund (SMSF) that I intend to eventually retire to with my wife. In the interim, I\u2019d like to make use of the space by building a unique dwelling (a bus restored as a mini-house) and rent it on Airbnb, with any money made being put back into the super fund. If we intend to only visit the property for maintenance and upkeep, and all revenue earned from renting out the property is directed back into the super fund, is this allowed? My main concern is that I\u2019d be making improvements to the property with my own money, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s allowed in a SMSF situation. Realistically, I\u2019d be happy to purchase the property and do nothing with it (allowing the value to increase over time and ensure I have a retirement block to go to when the time comes to stop working). But I figure if it\u2019s feasible to make a few thousand dollars a year in rent and put it into my super, it\u2019d be a better idea. Michael.\n\nA: While it may seem like a novel idea to convert a bus into a mini-home on vacant land paid for by your super savings to secure a place to retire to, it is not exactly a simple exercise. This is because of superannuation rules you will need to keep in mind when considering such an enterprise, says accountant Brad Eppingstall, a director of RSM Australia in Ballarat.\n\nMost important \u2013 in order for your SMSF to justify buying the land on which you will build your \u201cunique\u201d dwelling that you will rent out \u2013 is being able to show that what you propose is a viable business enterprise.\n\nThe way you describe your venture is that your SMSF will buy a vacant block of land on which you will develop a property and then run it as a rental accommodation business. While there is nothing stopping you from setting up a mini-house on a vacant block with your own money, what may be more difficult is getting your SMSF involved.\n\nWhen SMSFs buy into a member\u2019s business, the property asset they acquire is the underlying real estate from which the business is run. That\u2019s the investment they make and you need to be able to show it is a viable business capable of paying the rent because, as well as owning a property, the return to your fund is the lease income your business will pay the fund.\n\nWhile it is possible you are trying to make your development look like a business, says Eppingstall, if the idea is based on having just one bus converted to a mini-house you will struggle to make the income it will generate look like a business. With any business real estate property exercise, the scale of the operation is an important aspect.", "description": "You need to demonstrate that what you're planning is a viable business enterprise, writes John Wasiliev, who answers your questions on superannuation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_12/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e83b346fc4ab01466afd1dac3a92d0c589d5057a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
