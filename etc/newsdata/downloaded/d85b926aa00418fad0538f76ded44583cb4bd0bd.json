But with a rejection rate over 99%, the program has been a clear failure.\n\nOne of 99% was Kelly Finlaw, a public school teacher in New York who recently testified about her experience with FedLoan Servicing.\n\n\u201cI was misled. Not just by FedLoan, but by other servicers. I was lied to,\u201d Finlaw testified to Congress last week. \u201cIn what other sectors of government are you able to lie to the people that you\u2019re servicing and then holding them responsible for the lies that you told them?\u201d\n\nKelly Finlaw testifying to Congress on September 19, 2019. (Photo: CSPAN) More\n\n\u2018I did what I was asked to do\u2019\n\nCreated by Congress in 2007, the PSLF program \u2014 as part of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 \u2014 was designed to help various public sector employees, from teachers to public health and law enforcement public service workers.\n\nThe program promised to forgive student debt for those who worked with public service employers for at least 10 years, while making 120 payments via eligible plans. In 2017, many of those borrowers qualified. But only 1% had their loans forgiven, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\n\u201cI did what I was asked to do. I called, I made my payments on time. I paid every month,\u201d Finlaw said, later adding: \"After 10 years of making student loan payments, October 2017 was my month \u2014 my light at the end of the tunnel. I remember standing in my living room when the light at the tunnel went dark.\"\n\nResponding to this extreme denial rate of the program in 2018, Congress approved funding to expand the number of borrowers in an initiative called the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF).\n\nBut as of May this year, the DOE had received 54,000 requests for TEPSLF and only approved 1% of these requests.\n\n(Source: GAO) More\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the many restrictive eligibility requirements of PSLF and TEPSLF make the program difficult for borrowers to understand and navigate,\u201d Jeff Appel Federal Student Aid U.S. Department of Education wrote in his testimony. \u201cWe are absolutely committed to helping borrowers navigate this complexity.\u201d\n\nThis summer, Finlaw joined the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the second-largest teachers union in the U.S., in a lawsuit that calls on the U.S. government to fix the PSLF program.\n\n\u201cThe very agency that is supposedly the champion of our nation\u2019s education system has failed to live up to its role in administering this Program,\u201d asserted the lawsuit, which was filed in July.\n\nAccording to the AFT, thousands of teachers who are union members may be affected by the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cLarge numbers of borrowers have pursued careers in public service, sometimes at lower pay than in the private sector, with the hope of one day achieving loan forgiveness through the PSLF program,\u201d Melissa Emrey-Arras, the GAO\u2019s director of education workforce and income security issues, wrote in her testimony. \u201cEducation needs to take action to better serve these borrowers and help smooth their long road towards loan forgiveness.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIn what other sectors of government are you able to lie to the people that you\u2019re servicing and then holding them responsible for the lies that you told them?\u201d", "authors": ["Aarthi Swaminathan", "Reggie Wade"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fHsA.WtnnQ.QjjUz5MXxfg--~B/aD04MzQ7dz0xMzEzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/022762e0-de01-11e9-b6ff-ef4fb2858bf5", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
