I will build a broad and liberal government that will deliver the will of the people. We will not surrender to any dictate. The negotiations will be directed by me responsibly and with good judgment.\"MK Yair Lapid asked for patience, saying that building a government will take time and that meanwhile, there will be more attempts at political spin that should be ignored.\"The people did not put trust in Netanyahu, so he is trying to replace the people,\" Lapid said. \"The people of Likud are starting to realize it's the beginning of the end for [Netanyahu]. One person is preventing the formation of a liberal unity government.\"MK Moshe Ya'alon called upon right-wing and religious parties to shun Netanyahu, saying \"With him, it will not happen.\"\"I was surprised and disappointed that at this time, Benny Gantz still refuses to respond to my call to meet,\" Netanyahu said. \"The president called for unity, and without a meeting between the two major party leaders, it is impossible to form a unity government.\"The State of Israel needs as broad a unity government as possible - not another election and certainly not a government that relies on anti-Zionist parties,\" he said. \"Gantz, the invitation for us to meet still stands. It's what the public expects from us.\"Earlier, Netanyahu reached out to Gantz during a speech he gave at the memorial ceremony for former Israeli president Shimon Peres.\u201cA broad unity government is what is demanded now,\u201d he said. \u201cI propose that we meet as soon as possible without preconditions to cooperate in establishing a broad unity government for all those who believe in Israel as Jewish and democratic state. There is no reason to go to another election. I am against it.\u201dNetanyahu recalled the unity government between Peres and his Likud rival Yitzhak Shamir when the election results were similarly deadlocked and they rotated as prime minister from 1984 to 1988.\u201cWhen there was no clear outcome from the Knesset elections, Shimon chose national unity,\" Netanyahu said. \"He and Yitzhak Shamir agreed to cooperate - to navigate Israel's path to safety.\u201dPresident Reuven Rivlin, who will be tasked with determining whether Gantz or Netanyahu will have the first chance to form a coalition, spoke of the necessity of ending the deadlock between them and warned against a third election.\u201cI hear, loud and clear, the voices calling for a broad and stable national unity government and I congratulate you, Mr. Prime Minister, on joining that call this morning,\" he said. \"The responsibility for making it happens falls to you elected officials, especially the leaders of the major parties.\u201dStarting Sunday, Rivlin will be hosting meetings with the heads of the nine parties that crossed the threshold in Tuesday's election to see who they recommend to head the government.\u201cIt is imperative that we convene as quickly as possible, as soon as the final picture of the votes is clear, in order to work towards forming a government that can serve the State of Israel and the people of Israel again,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cFor my part, I will do everything I can to prevent another general election. But the responsibility for this, as well as the responsibility for forming a government that serves all the citizens of Israel with the dedication it deserves, is yours.\"During the event, he stood momentarily in between both Netanyahu and Gantz and clasped both their hands together in a three-person handshake, that symbolized the kind of governmental union that could end the electoral deadlock.\u201cOur current situation, which has gone on for a long time, with a transition government, grievously limits the ability of the government to act and to serve the citizens of Israel \u2013 and our ability to face the political, security and economic challenges we face,\" Rivlin said. \u201cWhen the factions come to me next week, they will have to explain to me and to all of us what they intend to do to form a government for Israel as soon as possible.\u201dIn a video statement he released, Netanyahu acknowledged that he promised a right-wing government during the election, but said that \u201cunfortunately, the results of the election showed it is not possible. The public did not decide between the two blocs.\u201dHe called on Gantz to meet with him as soon as possible to start the process of forming a coalition together, confirming an exclusive report in Thursday\u2019s Jerusalem Post. His office called Gantz\u2019s aides to plan a one-on-one meeting on Thursday.Netanyahu\u2019s statement came after his meeting with the leaders of religious right-wing parties Yamina, Shas and United Torah Judaism. On Wednesday, the parties agreed to negotiate as a bloc, which amounted to 55 seats as of Thursday morning's as-yet-incomplete vote count.New Right MK Naftali Bennett repeated the call, saying: \u201cA national unity government must be established with Netanyahu at its head, in which everyone who believes in a Jewish and democratic Israel is invited. We do not count out the haredim [ultra-Orthodox], Lapid \u2013 and certainly not Netanyahu.\u201dGreer Fay Cashman contributed to this report.\n\nvar cont = `Join Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.
