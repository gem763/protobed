The administration is simultaneously asking a federal appeals court in New Orleans to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional, an overhang of uncertainty that looms over the program.\n\nFor now, the Department of Health and Human Services is touting a second consecutive year of positive-sounding numbers. An additional 20 insurers will participate for 2020, expanding consumer choice in many states, officials said. Nearly 70 percent of customers will have three or more insurers from which to pick a plan.\n\nAbout 10 million people are covered through the health law\u2019s insurance markets, which offer taxpayer-subsidized private plans for people who aren\u2019t covered on the job. Former President Barack Obama\u2019s namesake law will be 10 years old in 2020.\n\nPremiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old choosing a standard plan will decline 4% on average next year in states served by the federal HealthCare.gov website, the Trump administration said. About a dozen states run their own sign-up websites, but most rely on HealthCare.gov.\n\nA low-cost midrange plan for that hypothetical 27-year-old will charge monthly premiums of $374 next year, officials said. The law\u2019s income-based subsidies can drop that to around $50.\n\nHowever, people who don\u2019t qualify for income-based assistance must pay full price, and that\u2019s before any deductibles and copays. Unsubsidized customers may just decide to go uninsured, particularly if they\u2019re healthy.\n\nA previous Republican Congress repealed a nudge to get more people signed up - unpopular fines for those who don\u2019t get covered.\n\nSix states will see premiums decline by 10% or more, officials said. They are Delaware, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Utah.\n\nThree states - Indiana, Louisiana and New Jersey - will see premiums increase 10% or more.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration, even as it pursues his goal of doing away with \u201cObamacare\u201d in the courts, is trying to take credit for the program\u2019s current stability.\n\n\u201cUntil Congress gets around to replacing it, the president will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans,\u201d HHS Secretary Alex Azar said. \u201cThe president who was supposedly trying to sabotage this law has been better at running it than the guy who wrote it.\u201d\n\nIndependent experts say it\u2019s more complicated than that.\n\nThey credit the Trump administration for working with a dozen states to approve waivers that can bring down premiums by setting up a backstop system for paying bills from the costliest patients.\n\nHowever, they say the original design of the law\u2019s subsidies is probably the major stabilizing force. People eligible for financial assistance are insulated from price spikes because they pay only a fixed percentage of their income for premiums.\n\n\u201cAs long as the subsidies are in place the changes that are happening \u2026 are not going to push this market off a cliff,\u201d Standard & Poor\u2019s director and lead analyst Deep Banerjee said.\n\nExperts say yet another factor is that insurers that have stuck with the program have learned over time how to operate profitably.\n\nThe Trump administration also disclosed that it had made some \u201cminor\u201d changes in how it reports data about the program. While those tweaks appear to be in the weeds, they\u2019re likely to get close attention from Democrats who accuse Trump of \u201csabotage\u201d of the health law.\n\nSign-up season starts Nov. 1 in most states and runs through Dec. 15. States that run their own open enrollment may have different dates.\n\nThe appeals court in New Orleans could issue its ruling during that time, but Azar said he\u2019s not concerned even if the judges say the whole program should be tossed.\n\n\u201cOur messaging would be to keep calm and carry on,\u201d he said, noting that the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court. \u201cThere will be no immediate disruption to anyone.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Consumers will have more health insurance choices next year under the Obama-era health care law and premiums will dip slightly for many customers, the Trump administration announced Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/trump_15250_c0-207-4969-3105_s1200x700.jpg?640d100af90a5bde66ea474e0126de90dcb545d7", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
