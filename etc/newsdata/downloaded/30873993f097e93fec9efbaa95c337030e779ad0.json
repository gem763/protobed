Yet how to discuss religious faith in class poses a major challenge for nonreligious colleges and universities. How can such an institution claim to educate students about ideas, culture, and ways of life if students, professors, or both are uncomfortable when talking about something that\u2019s been central to humanity throughout recorded history?\n\nI teach my classes at Wesleyan University, where I am also the president. For most of its first century, the school was\u2014as its name indicates\u2014firmly in the tradition of the theologian John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. In 1831, Wesleyan\u2019s first president, Wilbur Fisk, articulated the mission of the school as being for \u201cthe good of the individual and the good of the world,\u201d drawing on Methodism\u2019s synthesis of deeply personal spirituality and the pursuit of social reform. Indeed, the passion for reform often was energized by that spirituality. In the early 1900s, Wesleyan officially became a secular university, eventually prizing academic freedom and independent research rather than adhering to a set of religious teachings.\n\nStill, Fisk\u2019s words have continued to ring true. Although few of our students today know much about John Wesley\u2019s charismatic preaching or the core tenets of Methodism, many of them are still perfectly comfortable with the idea of finding one\u2019s own good while also doing work in the world that promotes what they now call social justice. If they no longer have a principled spirituality, they need to think hard about what else sustains efforts aimed at justice\u2014and about how politics, ethics, and the nature of knowledge have been intertwined with religious faith and practice.\n\nChris Coons: Democrats need to talk about their faith\n\nYet classroom discussions of these very subjects often seem threatening to even students of faith, who tell me they don\u2019t want to be \u201couted\u201d on campus. These undergrads encounter mostly secular professors who sometimes treat religious believers as somehow intellectually deficient, or as morally compromised by their commitments to traditions that their teachers have left behind.\n\nThese students have ample reason to feel left out. Not long ago, a group of such students at Wesleyan asked me to participate in a discussion about religion on campus, and now it was my turn to try to hide. \u201cHey,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m an atheist Jew. I\u2019m the wrong guy to talk about these topics.\u201d They pressed: What happened to your commitment to intellectual diversity? I signed up for the event. The organizers had planned a public conversation with Michael Wear, the director of evangelical outreach for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, and more than 100 students attended, comfortable to be talking about these issues in \u201csafe enough\u201d company. I participated, but while doing so I also explained my reluctance to show up. As a Jew, I worried about the easy slide from \u201cevangelical outreach\u201d to harassment, and then to anti-Semitism. The tension in the room was real, and so were the issues we discussed.", "description": "In college classrooms, where almost anything is up for discussion, religious ideas are met with awkward silence.", "authors": ["Michael S.
