Cameron Maybin and Clint Frazier homered for good measure in the eighth, and Aroldis Chapman struck out Albert Pujols to end it as fans\u2019 cellphones flashed to record to moment.\n\nPlayers lined up for handshakes and hugs, more exuberantly than usual, but there was no wild celebration on the field.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot bigger fish to fry, but this is the first step along the way,\u201d Boone said. \u201cNothing has got in their way. Whatever has come adversity-wise, they faced it and powered right through it.\u201d\n\nDespite putting 30 players on the injured list this season, New York (100-54) wrapped up first place with eight games to spare and made Aaron Boone the first manager to win 100 games in each of his first two major league seasons.\n\nThe Yankees open the playoffs on Oct. 4, likely against Minnesota, which leads the AL Central, or the wild-card winner.\n\nMasahiro Tanaka (11-8), in line to start the opener, allowed Kole Calhoun\u2019s homer leading off the fourth. The Angels had just four hits in seven innings off Tanaka, who struck out six and walked one.\n\nThe win came hours after Domingo Germ\u00e1n, their top-winning pitcher at 18-4, was placed on administrative leave under Major League Baseball\u2019s domestic violence policy. His status for the postseason is uncertain.\n\nNew York\u2019s 19th AL East title was its first following a run of 13 in 17 years that started in Derek Jeter\u2019s rookie season. The Yankees, led by young stars Aaron Judge, Gary S\u00e1nchez and Gleyber Torres, will be making their 21st postseason appearance in 25 years and 55th overall - 22 more than any other team.\n\nAnd they will head to the October following their 21st 100-win season, their first in back-to-back years since 2002-04.\n\nNew York moved into sole possession of the lead for good on June 15 with the start of an eight-game winning streak, beginning a spurt of 13 victories in 14 games that ended the month. The Yankees led by 6 1/2 games at the All-Star Game, won seven of their first nine after the break and have led by seven to 11 1/2 games since. And they achieved their success despite so many players landing on the injured list, the most in the major leagues since at least 2004.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s done a great job of stepping up when they\u2019re needed,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s 3-2 loss, the Yankees waited in their clubhouse for three hours until just before 1 a.m., hoping second-place Tampa Bay would lose at Los Angeles and ensure the division title for New York. But the Rays rallied in the ninth and defeated the Dodgers in 11 innings.\n\n\u201cIt was probably actually a good little team building, bonding, one of those times you enjoy being together,\u201d Boone said.\n\nProtective plastic remained overnight wrapping the six large-screen televisions in the Yankees clubhouse, a sign that the bubbly and beer celebration was not too far off. Moments after the final out, the spraying started.\n\nA few minutes later, many players headed back to the field for team pictures.\n\nLeMahieu\u2019s homer, which followed a rare infield hit by slow-legged catcher Austin Romine with two outs, landed about three rows over the scoreboard in right-center, giving him career bests of 25 homers and 97 RBIs in his first season with the Yankees. Gardner also set career highs for homers (26) and RBIs (69), and New York extended its team record with 292 long balls.\n\nIn his second game back from an injury layoff of nearly three months, Giancarlo Stanton was 0 for 3 with a walk and two strikeouts as a designated hitter his second game back from a layoff of nearly three months.\n\nAndrew Heaney (4-6) gave up six runs and five hits in five-plus innings.\n\nSTAR TURN\n\nPujols had a .328 career batting average when he left the St. Louis Cardinals after 11 major league seasons and joined the Angels for 2012. His career average dipped to .29995 with an 0 for 4 night. His average had not been below .300 at the end of a game since a 4-for-14 start as a rookie in 2001, according to the Elias Sport Bureau.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: RHP Dellin Betances has been told surgery is not recommended for the partially torn left Achilles tendon that ended his season after eight pitches. Manager Aaron Boone said the foot will be in a walking boot for another four weeks. \u2026 Judge was given a day off after he landed on his right shoulder during an attempt for a diving catch Wednesday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels: RHP Jamie Barria (4-8) will be on the mound at Houston, opposed by Zack Greinke (6-1).\n\nYankees: LHP J.A. Happ (12-8) starts Friday\u2019s series opener against Toronto, his former team.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The resilient New York Yankees powered their way to the club's first AL East title since 2012, routing the Los Angeles Angels 9-1 Thursday night behind three RBIs each from old mainstay Brett Gardner and newcomer DJ LeMahieu.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/angels_yankees_baseball_90238_c0-146-3493-2182_s1770x1032.jpg?8837ecea1faa020b4fe548b77afec5456f089d6d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
