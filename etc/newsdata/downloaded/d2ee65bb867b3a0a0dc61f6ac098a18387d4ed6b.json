The Facebook post garnered 20,000 shares.\n\nShe said her bag exceeded the necessary limit by four pounds due to overpacking and a pair of wet pants that were weighing it down.\n\n\"I wore my wet pants (the main reason of my excess),\" she said. \"They had my bag weighed again and it was already below the maximum required [for] hand carry.\"\n\nRodriguez is grateful her flight was delayed, which gave her pants time to dry.\n\nShe said she's happy the internet got a good laugh from her viral travel tip.", "description": "Gel Rodriguez told", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/woman-avoids-paying-baggage-fee-ht-MAIN-np-191018_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
