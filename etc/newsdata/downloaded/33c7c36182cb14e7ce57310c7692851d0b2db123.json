Willow died from injuries she suffered while trapped inside the burning structure, according to New York State Police at Painted Post.\n\nSteuben County District Attorney Brooks Baker told WETM that the brothers allegedly saved their meth-making equipment, but left Willow inside the home. After saving the equipment, they went to get cigarettes and did not report the blaze, the station reported.\n\nA subsequent investigation involving state police and the Steuben County fire investigation team determined the Riverside house was the likely site of a meth-making operation, state police said.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, state police initially charged Willow's grandson, Justin L. Gause, 21, of Corning, with second-degree manslaughter, first-degree reckless endangerment and third-degree unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine, all felonies.\n\nThe Steuben County District Attorney's Office presented the case to a grand jury, which last week indicted Gause on the more serious charge of second-degree murder. The grand jury also charged Gause's brother, Jarrett Gause, 33, of Bath, with second-degree murder in connection with Willow's death.\n\nJarrett Gause was arrested after the indictments were unsealed and is in custody at the Steuben County Jail.\n\nJustin Gause was initially incarcerated at the jail but is currently free on bail, state police said.\n\nSteuben County District Attorney Brooks Baker said the murder charge does not indicate the brothers intended to kill their grandmother, but reflects a greater level of recklessness than a manslaughter charge.\n\nThe suspects will be arraigned on the charges in Steuben County Court in the near future, Baker said.\n\nFollow Jeff Murray on Twitter @SGJeffMurray.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Elmira Star-Gazette: Brothers charged with murder allegedly left grandma to die in a fire", "description": "A Steuben County grand jury two men in connection with a May fire that was reportedly caused by a meth lab and killed their grandmother.", "authors": ["Jeff Murray", "Elmira Star-Gazette"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
