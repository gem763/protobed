These qubits make use of a quantum phenomena known as superposition, meaning they exist in two states at once.\n\nThe ability to act as both a \u2018one\u2019 and a \u2018zero\u2019 at the same time, quantum computing systems are theoretically able to be exponentially more powerful than classical computers with every qubit added.\n\nThis exponential rate was called into question earlier this year by computer scientists at Google\u2019s quantum computing lab, who observed that their systems were gaining power at a \u201cdoubly exponential\u201d rate.\n\nHarmut Neven, director of Google\u2019s Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, told Quanta magazine in June that their most advanced quantum processor was improving at a rate far beyond what they thought was theoretically possible.\n\nMr Neven said that such a rate of development was almost unfathomable, as there is nothing that grows that quickly in the natural world with which to draw a comparison.\n\n\u201cIt looks like nothing is happening, nothing is happening, and then whoops, suddenly you\u2019re in a different world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to Google for comment on the leaked research paper.", "description": "Google has achieved a major milestone in quantum computing by building a machine capable of performing a calculation that a traditional computer cannot, according to a leaked paper.
