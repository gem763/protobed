And she thrives on it.\n\n\u201cEverybody says that we\u2019re the underdogs but I think (it adds) fuel to the fire,\u201d Jones told Reuters. \u201cIt gives us an edge and we want to go out there and prove everybody wrong because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen one analyst that\u2019s picked us to win the championship.\u201d\n\nThe two teams each begin their quest for a first-ever WNBA championship on Sunday, a potentially electric game.\n\nThe key for Connecticut will be maintaining its explosive energy, in a series where \u201cevery position is going to be tough,\u201d said Jones.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s not going to be pretty,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe understand that. We\u2019re looking forward to the challenge.\u201d\n\nAnd there is plenty reason to bet the Sun could give the Mystics a rough time, after a semi-final series that could better be defined as a reckoning than a sweep over the Los Angeles Sparks.\n\n\u201cOur sweep in the semi-finals was a huge confidence boost for our players,\u201d said Coach Curt Miller.\n\nBattle-hardened by regular season trials that included a five-game losing streak in June and July, they have built a \u201cchemistry and culture within the locker room\u201d that Miller points to as playing a \u201cbig part in the team\u2019s success.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey truly don\u2019t care who receives the credit and attention, they just want to continue to win,\u201d said Miller.\n\nThey face their first hurdle with back-to-back road games in Washington, D.C., before heading home for Game 3.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest threat we\u2019re bringing to the finals is our team confidence,\u201d said Morgan Tuck, a first-round draft pick in 2016 and a former standout at UConn.\n\n\u201cI really think this is the best situation for us because we all feel like we have something to prove and a chip on our shoulder.\u201d", "description": "From analysts and experts, to bookies and betmakers, the Washington Mystics are considered by far the favorites to clinch the U.S. Women's National Basketball Association championship this year over the Connecticut Sun.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
