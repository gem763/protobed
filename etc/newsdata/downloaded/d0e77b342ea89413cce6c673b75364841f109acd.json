Many stores in the country don't even accept physical notes and coins, with signs being put up by multiple retailers to say they don't let customers pay in cash.\n\nThe Riksbank is now looking to pilot the so-called \"e-krona\" currency this year, which it says could be introduced should the bank \"wish to do so.\"\n\nOther central banks have ramped up their efforts in the digital currency space since Facebook announced plans for its libra coin back in June. China's central bank for instance has said it is close to launching its own digital currency, while the Swiss National Bank last week said it was exploring the use of virtual currencies in trading.", "description": "The Riksbank has been exploring the potential issuance of digital currencies as cash use in Sweden declines dramatically.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105976033-1560925615431gettyimages-1156523636.jpeg?v=1567685774", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
