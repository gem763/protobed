Mr. Barr, speaking to reporters in the Capitol, also played it down, saying he was \u201cjust kicking around some ideas\u201d to see what could gain traction in the Senate\u2026\n\nBut Republicans who favor gun rights said they wanted more specifics, and several said it was pointless to even talk about Mr. Barr\u2019s plan at this point. As the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer, the attorney general will be a central figure in the debate over gun legislation, but senators agree that the president will have the final say.\n\n\u201cMy question was: \u2018Where is the president on this?\u2019 And I asked this question directly: \u2018Is this something the president supports?\u2019 And they didn\u2019t have an answer for that,\u201d said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who met with Mr. Barr on Tuesday evening. \u201cThat\u2019s an important piece. If the president doesn\u2019t support it, then there\u2019s no point.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Barr-Gun-Safety.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
