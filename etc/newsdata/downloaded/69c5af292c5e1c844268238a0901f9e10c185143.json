REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam later announced the formal withdrawal of the bill at a meeting after markets closed, a source at that meeting told Reuters.\n\nThe move would meet one of the protesters\u2019 key demands.\n\nThe Hang Seng closed at its highest in a month at 26,523.23 points, having rallied over 4% at one point, outpacing the 1.6% gains in MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS and 0.9% rise in Shanghai shares .SSEC.\n\nProperty stocks .HSNP jumped 7.4% while the financial sector sub-index .HSNF climbed 3.8%.\n\nFlag carrier Cathay Pacific (0293.HK), which has been caught in the crossfire between Chinese authorities and protesters in Hong Kong, rallied more than 7%.\n\n\u201cThere are people covering their short positions and bargain hunting on local blue chips,\u201d said Alex Wang, director at Ample Finance Group, as investors hope the formal withdrawal of the bill \u201cwill calm down the situation in the society.\u201d\n\nThe protests against the bill, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, began in March but snowballed in June and have since evolved into a push for greater democracy.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the announcement of the bill\u2019s withdrawal would help end the unrest. The initial reaction appeared sceptical and muted and the real gauge will be how many people take to the streets.\n\nDogged by escalations in local protests and the U.S.-China trade war, the Hang Seng lost 7.4% in August.\n\nThe double whammy has dampened business activity and dragged property prices in Hong Kong, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world.\n\nPaul Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary, said on Wednesday the operation of the stock market \u201ccontinues to be smooth and orderly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are monitoring closely trading volume and shorting on a daily basis, and have not seen anything peculiar,\u201d he said at a televised press conference.\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar HKD=D3, pegged to the greenback in a tight range of 7.75-7.85 per dollar, rose almost 0.1%.\n\n(Graphic: HK econ as of Sept 4, 2019, here)", "description": "Hong Kong's main share index <.HSI> surged more than 4% on Wednesday, ahead of the government's formal withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill that sparked three months of protests in the former British colony.", "authors": ["Noah Sin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426086441&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830MB"}
