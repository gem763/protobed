He then named each of the five exonerated men, who were also in attendance Sunday night and who had spent years behind bars. Their convictions were vacated in 2002.\n\nBackstage, a reporter from Remezcla asked Jerome: \u201cWhat does it mean that you\u2019re the first Afro-Latino to win an acting Emmy award and why do you think we haven\u2019t seen more?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a loaded question,\u201d said Jerome, who identifies as Afro-Latino and Dominican American. \u201cBut it\u2019s an honor, it\u2019s a blessing, and I hope this is a step forward for Dominicans, for Latinos, for Afro-Latinos. It\u2019s about time we are here.\u201d\n\nJerome, who grew up in the Bronx, also became the youngest ever to win in his acting category. He was reportedly the only Latinx winner on Sunday evening.\n\nThe Television Academy, which produces the Emmy Awards, and Jerome did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nThe #Emmys crowd reacts to Jharrel Jerome's win for best actor in a limited series or movie for #WhenTheySeeUs https://t.co/nAKOeMzLKN pic.twitter.com/REQskbg27m \u2014 Variety (@Variety) September 23, 2019\n\nActor Billy Porter joined Jerome in breaking barriers on Sunday, becoming the first openly gay Black man to win as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama, for his role in the FX series \u201cPose.\u201d\n\nBackstage, Jerome was also asked about the academy often giving awards to stories about Black people\u2019s struggles rather than their joys. Of the Exonerated Five, Wise \u2015 whom Jerome called \u201cKing Korey Wise\u201d in his acceptance speech \u2015 spent the most time in prison.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I think our strongest stories are the stories of pain considering that\u2019s what we go through on a daily basis. It is unfortunate that comedies or light pieces of work aren\u2019t as praised and aren\u2019t sent to the award season,\u201d Jerome said. \u201cThe truth is our pain needs to be told. So if it has to be for the next 20 years where we are just painfully telling our stories until we can move on, then I guess it has to be.\u201d\n\nJharrel Jerome and Korey Wise are the undisputed stars of the Netflix afterparty dance floor pic.twitter.com/DFs8ab6Gdh \u2014 Kyle Buchanan (@kylebuchanan) September 23, 2019", "description": "The 21-year-old actor from Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d was also the youngest ever to win in his category.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d891f532300009705d65e26.jpeg?cache=wjgvkezbjd&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
