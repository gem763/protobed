The other members, besides Russia itself, are Cuba, Mongolia and Vietnam.\n\nHungary left the bank during nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s first term in 2000, citing a lack of transparency. But three years after Putin revamped it in 2012, Hungary rejoined, and is now its second biggest shareholder.\n\nThe move to Budapest will \u201cstrengthen the role of Hungary and Budapest as an international financial centre\u201d, the Hungarian government\u2019s press office told AFP in an email.\n\n\u2013 Security risks \u2013\n\nThe bank is expected to have more than 100 international staff when fully operational in a permanent office next year, but the background of some senior figures has raised concerns among some observers.\n\nAlthough the bank has firmly denied ever carrying out spying activity and rejects the \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 analogy, its chairman, veteran diplomat Nikolay Kosov, has alleged family links to the Russia\u2019s KGB.\n\nHungary\u2019s delegate to the bank, Imre Boros, worked for Hungarian intelligence during the country\u2019s pre-1990 communist era.\n\nLegislation approved by Budapest in March, meanwhile, grants wide-ranging diplomatic immunity to some of its foreign staff.\n\n\u201cStaff regulations follow the usual practise for significant international organisations like the IMF,\u201d the government\u2019s press office told AFP.\n\nThe IIB says it is entitled to such privileges as it is registered with the United Nations as a multilateral, intergovernmental development bank.\n\nIt \u201creceives no more\u201d immunity than the EBRD or the World Bank in the US, said IIB senior official Imre Laszloczki in a recent interview in Hungarian media.\n\nBut observers like Andras Racz, a Russia expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations, argue that the leeway given to the IIB is much wider.\n\n\u201cThere are clear security risks that don\u2019t look to be addressed properly,\u201d Racz said.\n\nNor will the bank\u2019s activities be subject to financial control or regulatory supervision in Hungary, he told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe language of the bank is Russian, the headquarters was in Moscow for the last 49 years, the director is Russian. They have de facto control due to the decision-making structure. It is a Russian-dominated bank,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Economic opportunities? \u2013\n\nAccording to Budapest, the move \u201cwill bring shareholders, including Hungary, positive results, and will offer players of the Hungarian economy further new opportunities\u201d.\n\nBut some analysts suspect the bank\u2019s loans could easily be funnelled toward business allies of Orban.\n\nOthers however point out that the bank\u2019s lending portfolio \u2014 around 750 million euros ($830 million) in 2018 \u2014 is dwarfed by those of western development lending institutions.\n\n\u201cThe IIB may have a bit of an economic impact, but the size will be small,\u201d Andras Deak, an expert at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, told AFP.\n\nMoscow\u2019s leverage with Hungary has grown since Orban adopted a policy of \u201ceastern opening\u201d toward Russia, Turkey and China after returning to power in 2010.\n\nIn 2014 he signed a 10-billion euro ($11 billion) loan deal with Putin to expand Hungary\u2019s only nuclear plant at Paks, south of Budapest.\n\nThe IIB is likely to be discussed this week in Budapest during a meeting between Putin and Orban.\n\nThey are also due to sign a major gas energy supply deal and finalise a Hungarian-Russian consortium to produce railway carriages for Egypt.", "description": "Budapest (AFP) \u2013 Called \u201cPutin\u2019s Trojan horse\u201d by Hungarian opposition politicians, a small Russian-dominated bank in Budapest has", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/849bb2_politicians-in-hungary-fear-bank-is-as-conduit-russian-intelligence-service-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
