Here are the main measures expected from the report, based on Bloomberg-compiled consensus data:\n\n3Q GDP Annualized quarter-on-quarter: +1.6%, vs. +2.0% in Q2\n\n3Q Personal Consumption: +2.6% vs. +4.6% in Q2\n\n3Q Core Personal Consumption Expenditures quarter-on-quarter: +2.2%, vs. +1.9% in Q2\n\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve\u2019s closely watched GDPNow model pointed to a slightly less pronounced deceleration to 1.7% growth in the third quarter, based on the institution\u2019s most recent prediction on Monday.\n\n\u201cIncoming data point to a moderating pace of GDP growth in the second half of the year,\u201d Sam Bullard, managing director and senior economist for Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cAs the tailwinds from fiscal stimulus wane, trade policy uncertainty persists, and sluggish global demand continues, the pace of U.S. GDP growth should moderate over the coming quarters.\u201d\n\nA slowdown in nonresidential investment likely generated a drag on headline GDP for the July through September period. Business investment turned negative during the second quarter for the first time since 2016, with most economists expecting these declines to have continued into the third quarter. Ongoing geopolitical concerns have spurred business to shore up resources and curb new spending to prepare for a future downturn.\n\nThis trend has been reflected in the bulk of the latest economic data releases, with many of these serving as leading indicators for the eventual GDP print. September\u2019s manufacturing activity index report from the Institute for Supply Management showed a contraction in new orders, production and employment, and fell to the lowest level in a decade.\n\n\u201cThe near-term outlook for capital spending remains weak, reflecting slowing global growth, deteriorating business confidence and a softening pace of manufacturing activity,\u201d Bullard said.\n\nSome transitory manufacturing factors, including fewer shipments of Boeing (BA) aircraft and the 40-day United Auto Workers strike on General Motors (GM), may also drag on headline GDP, other economists pointed out.\n\nPeople walk along a main shopping street in Manhattan in New York City.

Personal consumption rose by 4.6%, the most in four-and-a-half years, in the second quarter.\n\nHowever, cracks have since begun to show in service-related industries as well, leading economists to temper expectations that a strong consumer will prop up flagging growth in other areas for this GDP report. The ISM\u2019s report on service sector activity fell to a three-year low in September.\n\n\u201cUntil recently, the domestic data flow in the U.S. has been split, with weakness in manufacturing and trade-related sectors offset by solid growth in household spending,\u201d Barclays economist Michael Gapen said in a note last week. \u201cThe recent data flow in the U.S. suggests that softness in the goods-producing sectors is leading to a broader-based slowing in economic activity.\u201d\n\nNotably, September and August\u2019s jobs reports reflected fewer-than-expected job gains, and wage increases slowed. Retail sales for both months also missed expectations, pointing to slower household spending. These are expected to pull down the personal consumption component of GDP, a segment comprising nearly 70% of economic activity.\n\nOther areas of the economy, however, have remained strong or improved in the three months to September. Economists expect that government outlays likely remained robust in the third quarter, following a 4.8% increase in the second quarter.
