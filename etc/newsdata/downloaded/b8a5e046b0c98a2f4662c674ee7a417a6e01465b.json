Jason Biggs and Shannon Elizabeth are keen", "language": "en", "text": "Another American Pie? (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nWhen every other film and TV is getting a reboot, you might as well throw American Pie in the mix, as far as lead star Jason Biggs is concerned.\n\nEven though we\u2019ve had many a fill of pie, the Jim Levenstein actor has thrown his pants into the ring for another spin around the franchise.\n\nAnd he\u2019s been joined by Shannon Elizabeth (who played Nadia in the original).\n\nAs the pair headed to the Jay And Silent Bob Reboot (see, another reboot) at TCL Chinese Theatre this week, they shared their excitement at any opportunity to take another slice of pie.\n\n\u2018I am always down. You will never hear from me any reluctance, but I haven\u2019t heard anything for a little while,\u2019 Jason said, as per We Got This Covered.\n\nShannon played Jim\u2019s not-really love interest (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018It is the most fun I have ever had working on anything. I love that cast, and I love that role.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added, with what we can only assume was a twinkle in his eye: \u2018A lot of things have to come together for it to happen, but fingers crossed it will.\u2019\n\nShannon chimed in with her own thoughts, as she added: \u2018Look, I think reboots are great because you can get a new generation, a young cast, that is doing the film, but you make it modern and it works for this day and age.\n\nJason is up for it (Picture: WireImage)\n\n\u2018So, I never think that is a bad thing.\u2019\n\nEh, we\u2019re a pessimistic bunch but even we\u2019d be keen to see where Stifler has ended up after all this time.\n\nBack in July the film\u2019s cast reunited on the 20th anniversary, which would have been a perfect time to start etching out the script, don\u2019t you think?\n\nIn an epic selfie most of the gang have come together, including Jason, Alyson Hannigan (Michelle), Seann William Scott (Stifler), Chris Klein (Oz), Tara Reid (Vicky) and Natasha Lyonne (Jessica) \u2013 with the snap no doubt sending fans wild.\n\nLuckily for us, the selfie was in aid of a two-part reunion special the cast had been filming for Entertainment Tonight.\n\nWhile their baby faces might now be gone, they\u2019ll forever live on screen in American Pie\u2019s four movies; American Pie, American Pie 2, American Wedding and American Reunion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure there were a couple of spin-offs too, but they were tossed aside like that one time at band camp because let\u2019s face it American Pie just isn\u2019t American Pie without Jim and his, let\u2019s say, astonishingly bad luck.\n\nGuess we\u2019ll just watch this space.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
