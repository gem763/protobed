She is a single mother with a child in the same classroom as our son. The kids are not friends, but they are friendly and bound to be in classes and activities together again. How do I handle this?\n\n\u2014 Cheated On\n\nCheated On: With tremendous self-care to start \u2014 since this sounds like slow torture, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, though, the seemingly worst element of the situation \u2014 that you have to face everyone constantly through your son \u2014 will prove to be the most useful. Anger is a natural and healthy response, but only if you don\u2019t allow it to linger. And although you might think the constant exposure to these two will keep stirring up the anger, the opposite can also be true if you let it be: that constant exposure will force you to let go of the anger, because intense feelings are just naturally hard to sustain. Familiarity gives you a chance to get bored with anger and dread, bored with yourself feeling angry and stressed, enough to make the changes you need to feel better. You won\u2019t be able to avoid your new reality, so take that as a chance to get used to it. Really fast.\n\nHaving kids involved, meanwhile, will force you to keep choosing your best behavior when you\u2019re tempted to give it your worst. Again, if you let it \u2014 but I suspect you will, just given that you\u2019re mindful the two kids are friendly and are preparing for them to remain that way.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nSo that\u2019s how I suggest you handle it. Push through the torture of the early days and let the whole thing get familiar, staying civil throughout for the kids. That will allow you to feel good about yourself, which is how you\u2019ll find your way to feeling good again in general.\n\nWhen you need an extra dose of resilience going into a school situation, I suggest this as your mantra: \u201cThese two are each other\u2019s problem now.\u201d A potentially useful part of the truth.\n\nRe: Cheating Spouse: My husband left me for the neighbor down the street when I had three kids younger than 5, after an affair that included leaving me and the newborn in the hospital to be with her \u2014 not that I knew it at the time, of course. He married her, eventually cheated on her, too (surprise!).\n\nThe anger and rage lasted a long time, and I am sure I was not always my best as a mom. I was so terrified of what would become of us and how would I survive. I got counseling and eventually moved on, much thanks to wonderful supportive family and friends.\n\nI still hate him for the betrayal and for putting our children through that, but now we have a grandchild in common and I am civil \u2014 more than civil, actually \u2014 for her sake. My advice would be right along with Carolyn's: They deserve each other. Also: karma. Good luck!\n\n\u2014 Eventually Moved On\n\nEventually Moved On: Oh, man. You win.
