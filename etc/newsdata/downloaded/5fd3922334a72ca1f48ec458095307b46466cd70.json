The data curves signaled the detection of microbial respiration on the Red Planet. The curves from Mars were similar to those produced by LR tests of soils on Earth.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That meant that Nasa concluded that the LR results came from a substance that was mimicking life but was not actually life itself.\n\nSince then, Nasa has not a run a similar experiment has focused on examining whether the Martian habitat could be a suitable home for alien life.\n\nBut Levin argues that those findings actually suggested that there is alien life on Mars. And, he argued, Nasa must do more to follow them up \u2013 because they could pose a significant threat to life on Earth.\n\n\"NASA maintains the search for alien life among its highest priorities,\" he wrote. On February 13, 2019, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said we might find microbial life on Mars.\n\n\"Our nation has now committed to sending astronauts to Mars. Any life there might threaten them, and us upon their return. Thus, the issue of life on Mars is now front and center.\"\n\nSumming up the evidence of alien life, he wrote his experiment had found a whole host of positive results. But perhaps most strongly of all, he said there had been no experiment that had provided an alternative explanation for the results that came back from the LV experiment.\n\n\"What is the evidence against the possibility of life on Mars? The astonishing fact is that there is none,\" he wrote. \"Furthermore, laboratory studies have shown that some terrestrial microorganisms could survive and grow on Mars.\"\n\nIn his conclusion, he asked that Nasa conduct the same kind of experiments again, taking an altered version of the LR experiment to Mars on the next possible trip. And he asked that scientists be convened to examine those more than 40-year-old findings to see if they really were proof of life on Mars.\n\n\"Such an objective jury might conclude, as I did, that the Viking LR did find life,\" he wrote. \"In any event, the study would likely produce important guidance for NASA\u2019s pursuit of its holy grail.\"", "description": "Nasa found evidence of alien life in the 1970s, according to a former senior scientist \u2013 and ignored it.
