Because we believe we need to stop Brexit to get our country back on track.\u201d\n\nPreviously parties have pulled out of specific election seats so votes can unite around a single Remain candidate - the best way to win under the UK's first-past-the-post system.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMs Swinson said last night: \u201cThere will be some places where a party like Plaid Cymru and the Greens might have a stronger chance\u201d.\n\nSir Ed added: \"We have been discussing with Plaid and with Greens who both share our view that we need to stop Brexit.\"\n\nSaying the Lib Dems \"want to see if there\u2019s things we can do with them\", he added: \"We will look to see if we can work with them to make sure we can defeat Boris Johnson and defeat the Labour Party.\n\nGeneral election 2019 countdown UK goes to polls in 0 Days 0 Hours 0 minutes 0 Seconds\n\n\"Before the election we will have some discussions, they are already ongoing, and we\u2019ll see the fruits of those shortly, with Plaid and with the Green Party.\"\n\nSeparately the Lib Dems have faced questions over whether they could prop up Labour or the Tories after the election if there is a hung Parliament.\n\nQuestioned this morning, Ms Swinson did not explicitly rule it out.\n\nAsked if she was ruling out supporting either Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn as prime minister, Ms Swinson told the BBC: \"I can't be clearer.\n\n\"Neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn is fit to be prime minister.\n\n\"Our country deserves a better choice, and I am standing as candidate to be prime minister.\u201d\n\nAsked if she would be prepared to enter into some kind of informal deal with the Tories or Labour without those two men at the helm, she said: \u201cBoth of those parties as currently configured are parties that want to force through Brexit on our country.\n\n\"It's going to be bad for our country. And they both have that shared vision for the future. The Liberal Democrats have a different positive alternative vision for the future.\"\n\nHowever, Sir Ed ruled out a coalition or deal in an almost simultaneous appearance on BBC Breakfast. And Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said: \"Yep. Let\u2019s make this clear from now.\"", "description": "Jo Swinson said there are some places where certain Remain parties might have a stronger chance", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20747815.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
