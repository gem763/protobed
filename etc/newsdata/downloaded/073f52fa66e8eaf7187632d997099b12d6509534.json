REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nLast year, the U.S. military put countering China and Russia at the centre of a new national defence strategy, the latest sign of shifting priorities after more than a decade and a half of focussing on the fight against Islamist militants.\n\n\u201cIt is increasingly clear that Russia and China want to disrupt the international order by gaining a veto over other nations\u2019 economic, diplomatic, and security decisions,\u201d Esper said at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London. His comments are largely in line with his predecessors.\n\n\u201cThe United States is facing this challenge head-on, but if we are to preserve the world all of us have created together through decades of shared sacrifice, we must all rise to the occasion,\u201d Esper said, adding that both countries were increasing capabilities in the space and cyber realms.\n\nThere are a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-Chinese relationship, which include an escalating trade war, American sanctions on China\u2019s military, and the U.S. relationship with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province.\n\nEsper described a litany of concerns about China, from the way it uses its economic power to technology theft,\n\n\u201cI would caution my friends in Europe \u2013 this is not a problem in some distant land that does not affect you,\u201d he added.\n\nResponding to a question after his speech, Esper said he would be discussing Huawei with his British counterpart later on Friday.\n\nIn July, Britain postponed a decision on whether Huawei could participate in building next-generation 5G mobile networks until it had a clearer picture of the impact of U.S. measures taken against the Chinese company.\n\nEsper said that while it was premature for now, there could come a time in the future where the United States\u2019 ability to share intelligence and technology with allies could be impacted depending on how Huawei is being used.\n\nEsper pointed to the situation in Hong Kong, which has been engulfed in angry and sometimes violent protests against the government for months over a bill on extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China.\n\n\u201cWe all see what\u2019s happening to those who continue to speak out against the (Chinese Communist Party\u2019s) influence in Hong Kong,\u201d Esper said.\n\n\u201cI was there for the handover in 1997 when the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d designation was affirmed \u2013 I would ask you: given what we see in Hong Kong today, has China kept those promises?\u201d\n\nEsper said his preference was for long-term engagement with China\u2019s leadership.\n\nEsper also highlighted the risks posed by Russia, from a potential incursion into a neighbouring country to its actions in Syria.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Secretary of Defence Mark Esper arrives for a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Abe's official residence in Tokyo, Japan, August 7, 2019. REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nHis comments come even as President Donald Trump drew disagreement from U.S. allies recently by calling for Russia to be readmitted to the Group of Seven advanced industrialized countries.\n\n\u201cTo put it simply, Russia\u2019s foreign policy continues to disregard international norms,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThere are increasing concerns that Russia and the United States are headed towards an arms race after Washington formally pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) pact last month, accusing Russia of violating it, allegations Moscow denied.", "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, in his first major speech, on Friday called for a greater European focus on tackling what he called growing security and economic threats from China and Russia.", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426877561&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850XF", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
