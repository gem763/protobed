USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Protesterrs briefly interrupted Pete Buttigieg\u2019s opening answer during a CNN LGBTQ town hall on Thursday, raising banners and calling attention to violence against transgender women of color.\n\nThe protesters walked to the front of the room just as the South Bend, Indiana, mayor and Democratic presidential candidate was beginning to answer a question. They were holding up a transgender pride flag with the words \"we are dying\" written on it, shouting \u201cTrans people are dying!\u201d and \"Do something!\"\n\nSome members of the audience joined in chanting \u201cTrans lives matter.\"\n\nAfter the demonstrators were removed from the room, Buttigieg said, \u201cI do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators were speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women in this country right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I believe or would like to believe that everybody here is committed to ending that epidemic, and that does include lifting up its visibility and speaking to it,\u201d he continued.\n\nAs @PeteButtigieg\u2019s town hall begins, trans protesters hold flags and chant. He\u2019s now addressing how diverse and challenged the LGBTQ community is and that it must be open to acceptance #EqualityTownHallpic.twitter.com/mcLr9zG9br \u2014 Kyung Lah (@KyungLahCNN) October 11, 2019\n\nCNN moderator Anderson Cooper took a moment to \"just point out there is a long and proud tradition in history in the gay and lesbian and transgender community of protest, and we applaud them for their protests. They are absolutely right to be angry and upset at the lack of attention particularly in the media.\"\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Campaign's website, advocates tracked in 2018 at least 26 deaths of transgender people in the U.S. due to fatal violence, the majority of whom were black transgender women. In 2019, at least 19 transgender people have been fatally shot or killed by other violent means, and many them were women of color.\n\nCandidate Sen. Kamala Harris was also interrupted by an audience member on the issue, and answered, \"You're right ... I hear you,\" continuing to describe her efforts to eliminate the \"gay panic defense\" as a way to fight violence against transgender people when she was San Francisco\u2019s District Attorney.\n\nButtigieg also said he is \"very mindful of the fact that my experience as a gay man \u2014 as a white gay man \u2014 there are dimensions of what it\u2019s like to be a black gay woman that I also do not understand. But I also think the diversity within the LGBTQ-plus community is part of what we have to offer right now.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/10/trans-women-color-focus-protestors-who-interrupt-cnn-town-hall/3937906002/", "description": "They were holding up a transgender pride flag with the words \"we are dying\" written on it.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
