Death Becomes Her (1992) Two women \u2013 a struggling writer (Goldie Hawn) and an aging actor (Streep) \u2013 take a magic potion that promises to make them beautiful and young forever. While Streep\u2019s ruthlessly ambitious Madeline Ashton and Hawn\u2019s Helen Sharp are both cast as villains, it\u2019s easy to sympathise with women compelled to take drastic action to meet society's standards of beauty. And although it tanked at the box office upon its release in 1992, Robert Zemeckis\u2019s black comedy has become a cult favourite \u2013 particularly for the LGBT+ community \u2013 thanks to the sheer thrill of watching Streep and Hawn whack each other over the heads with shovels. \u201cThis is absolutely through the roof, hyperbolic farce,\u201d Streep has said of the movie. \u201cIn one take we would try to do one take that had some grounding in human experience, and then the sky was the limit.\u201d Streep achieves this, for despite the head-turning antics of her character you can still find something about the female experience to identify with. (RO) 2/15 14. Mamma Mia (2008) The Oscar-winner is known for her weightier roles, but she takes a different direction in Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s Abba inspired hit blockbuster. Streep plays the singing and dancing Donna Sheridan-Carmichael (highlights include her singing \u201cSuper Trouper\u201d), who runs the hotel Villa Donna on a Greek Island. Her daughter, Sophie, is getting married and has invited three of her mum\u2019s former lovers (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) along, in the hope that one of them is her father, and can give her away. Streep had sung before in Postcards from Edge (1990) and A Prairie Home Companion (2006) \u2013 but doing the splits was a career first. (CC) Rex Features 3/15 13. Out of Africa (1985) This epic romantic drama, directed and produced by Sydney Pollack, starred Meryl Streep and Robert Redford as doomed lovers in Africa. But despite the film winning seven Academy Awards in 1986, including for Best Picture and Best Director \u2013 Streep\u2019s restrained performance as the Danish Baroness Karen Dinesan, whose memoir of colonial life the film is based on, lost out to Geraldine Page\u2019s old lady Mrs Watts in The Trip to Bountiful. The onscreen chemistry between Streep and Redford lacked the passion and electricity of, say, her and Kurt Russell in Silkwood (1983), but the film certainly made up for it in sweeping panoramic cinematography. (CC) Rex Features 4/15 12. Defending Your Life (1991) Albert Brooks wrote, directed and starred in this comedy classic. It tells the story of Daniel Miller, who is sent to the afterlife, after a car crash, where he falls in love with the sweet Julia (played by Streep), who has led a perfect life. But he is on trial in Judgement City and must conquer his fears to move on to the next phase of existence, or else be sent back to earth to let them go. It was not a box-office hit when it was released but has since gained a cult following. Streep met Brooks at a party, when he told her about his film, and she asked: \u201cIs there a part in it for me?\u201d (CC) Rex 5/15 11. Silkwood (1983) Given that Streep plays real-life whistle blower Karen Silkwood, who was exposed to a life-threatening dose of nuclear radiation and died in a suspicious car accident at the age of 28, Silkwood could easily have been a grim, even turgid affair. But thanks to Streep\u2019s brilliant performance \u2013 her Karen is mischievous, flawed and heroic, flashing her co-workers and risking her life for the sake of justice all in one day \u2013 it is nothing of the sort. \u201cIt was magic,\u201d said Silkwood\u2019s boyfriend Drew Stephens when he saw the film. \u201cIt makes a human being out of Karen, instead of myth.\u201d (AP) Rex 6/15 10. Deer Hunter (1978) Cast in the role of Linda after Robert De Niro saw her in a stage production of Chekhov\u2019s The Cherry Orchard at Lincoln Center, Streep was a revelation in Michael Cimino's brutal treatise on the agony of the Vietnam War. In a film where the machismo is excessive, Streep exists as some kind of counterpoint, playing with great restraint a young woman torn between her commitment to her fianc\u00e9 (Christopher Walken) and her desire for his best friend (Robert De Niro). Her mournful singing of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d at the end has gone down in cinematic lore. (PS) 7/15 9. Postcards From the Edge (1990) Has there ever been a feistier on-screen mother-daughter rivalry than Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine\u2019s? MacLaine plays a volatile, self-absorbed actor, Streep her recovering drug addict daughter \u2013 also an actor, albeit a less famous one. The film is based on Carrie Fisher\u2019s revered semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, and Streep and MacLaine more than do it justice. Their chemistry is intoxicating, and Streep shines as a sweet screw-up trying to avoid a full-on breakdown. (AP) 8/15 8. The Bridges of Madison Country (1995) Streep\u2019s most frequently overlooked role is that of bored housewife Francesca Johnson in Clint Eastwood\u2019s adaptation of Robert James Waller\u2019s best-selling novel. Francesca is the embodiment of loneliness and frustration \u2013 living with her husband and their children in an isolated farmhouse set against the vast stretches of land in Iowa, US. Streep takes the schmaltzy romance of the original material and transforms it into something with gravitas and passion. Where a lesser actor might not be as convincing, Streep persuades the audience that her character believes her affair with Eastwood\u2019s roaming photographer Robert Kincaid is necessary to help her escape her humdrum existence. A fierce, unhurried performance is what builds the superb tension in this film. RO) Getty Images 9/15 7. The Hours (2002) This cinematic triptych, in which three women\u2019s lives are interconnected by Virginia Woolf\u2019s 1925 novel Mrs Dalloway, takes place over the course of a single day in three different decades. Nicole Kidman plays Woolf, Julianne Moore a trouble Fifties housewife who finds solace in the writer\u2019s tome, and Streep Noughties New Yorker Clarissa, a modern-day embodiment of the novel\u2019s title character. As a woman whose life is slipping out of her control, Streep is commanding, tormented, elegant. (AP) 10/15 6. Sophie's Choice (1982) False teeth, eerie accent, dramatic fireworks, check: this famously strange and tortured performance bagged Streep her first Oscar as a leading actress, three decades before her second as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. In Alan J Pakula's ponderous, emotionally pornographic adaptation of the William Styron bestseller, Streep's Sophie \u2013 a Polish immigrant and Holocaust survivor in a Brooklyn boarding house \u2013 is the one element that escapes mustiness, bringing fidgety life and neurosis to a part that had Oscar written all over it. (PS) 11/15 5. Julie & Julia (2009) As beloved American chef Julia Child, \u201cthe woman who taught America to cook\u201d, Streep gives one of her most charismatic performances to date \u2013 one that goes beyond mere imitation. Norah Ephron cast Streep, an old friend, after the actor heard she was working on the project and immediately offered her best impression of Child\u2019s famous, high-pitched catchphrase: \u201cBon appetit!\u201d What is most impressive about Streep in this Oscar-nominated role is her resistance to portraying Child as some kind of cartoon character (she had met the chef in person, and found her to be surprisingly difficult). In between the charming displays of joie de vivre are subtle glimpses of Child\u2019s heartbreak over her and her husband\u2019s inability to conceive a child. And you can see how Streep, who has recalled being told she was not \u201cbeautiful\u201d enough for certain roles, could identify with Child\u2019s stubbornness at being told she wasn\u2019t good enough to attend the famous Cordon Bleu school of cooking. (RO) Rex 12/15 4. Adaptation (2002) Susan Orlean, the non-fiction writer who gets entangled in Charlie Kaufman's writer's block, was a chance for Streep to loosen up: she's light, funny and appealingly baffled by the film around her. The conceit starts with her obliviously going about her business, but then the script of Kaufman's imagination suddenly takes hold \u2013 and before you know it, she's working out her own fictional mid-life crisis in the most surprising ways. A shape-shifting part she layers with finesse, it coaxes out her mellow side, even if this is one of her wildest projects. (PS) Rex 13/15 3. The Devil Wears Prada (2006) Many would have been tempted to ham up the role as boss-from-hell Miranda Priestly, a ruthless fashion magazine editor who hires hapless Andi Sachs (Anne Hathaway) and pushes her to the brink, but Streep plays her as calmness personified. Why raise your voice when you can destroy someone\u2019s self-worth with the briefest of glances or the pursing of your lips? Streep was rightly Oscar-nominated for the role, and deserved to win for her cerulean sweater monologue alone. Barry Wetcher/20th Century Fox/REX/Shutterstock 14/15 2. Doubt (2008) In John Patrick Shanley\u2019s adaptation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning play (set in the Bronx during the Sixties), Streep is the severe Sister Aloysius opposite the late Philip Seymour Hoffman\u2019s cheerful, slightly bumbling Father Flynn. As she stalks up and down the pews filled with Catholic children, she requires little in the way of makeup, props or costume to create a sense of foreboding\u2013 just the glint on her spectacles and the black bonnet that enhances her crow-like mannerisms. Sister Aloysius is the last frontier between the old world she knows and understands \u2013 where fear is a necessary tool to set children on the path of righteousness \u2013 and the new one, in a film set shortly after the Second Vatican Council pledged to bring the Catholic church into the 20th century. This is (deservedly) one of Streep\u2019s most critically acclaimed roles, and earned her best actress nominations at the Oscars, Baftas and Golden Globes, along with a win at the Screen Actors Guild awards. (RO) 15/15 1. Kramer vs Kramer (1979) Stepping into a role that was originally meant for Charlie\u2019s Angels\u2019 Kate Jackson, Streep won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for Robert Benton's emotionally pummelling portrait of marital collapse. As Joanna, a frustrated spouse who walks out on her husband (Dustin Hoffman) and six-year-old son then returns 18 month later to fight for sole custody, Streep doesn't get much screen time but, boy, does she make it count. Hers is a performance that somehow makes you sympathise with Joanna's position, her face a mobile canvas onto which she paints angst, confusion and a deep melancholy. It's masterful. (PS) 1/15 15.
