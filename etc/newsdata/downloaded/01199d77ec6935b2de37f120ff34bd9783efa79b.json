The World Wide Web was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist born on June 8, 1955. Having studied physics at Queen's College Oxford, graduating in 1976, he started as an engineer in the telecommunications and microprocessor software industry. In 1980, while working as an independent contractor at CERN, Berners-Lee described the concept of a global system based on using hypertext to share information between researchers. Tim Berners-Lee wrote (pictured) the blueprint for what would become the World Wide Web, and said he is alarmed at what has happened to it in the last year He built a prototype system called Enquire, which formed the conceptual basis for the World Wide Web. In 1989 he published his landmark paper, 'Information Management: A Proposal', built the first WWW server and web browser 'WorldWideWeb.app'. In 1994, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium, the main international standards organisation for the internet.\n\nBut increasingly we're seeing that power for good being subverted, whether by scammers, people spreading hatred or vested interests threatening democracy.'\n\nHe confirmed that the Web Foundation, the group he founded to campaign for the open web as a public good and basic right, would publish its Contract for the Web next month \u2013 a collection of pledges aimed at all areas of society and their commitment to protecting the web in the future.\n\n'A year ago, I called for a new Contract for the Web, bringing together governments, companies and citizen groups to come up with a clear plan of action to protect the web as a force for good,' he said.\n\n'In a month's time that plan will be ready.\n\n'This birthday must mark the moment we take on the fight for the web we want.'\n\nThe Foundation has not confirmed the date it would publish the contract, but lists some of its principles on its website, which includes a pledge by governments to ensure everyone can connect to the internet and respect people's fundamental right to privacy.\n\nIt also asks individuals to pledge to be creators and collaborators online and build strong communities which respect civil discourse.", "description": "World Wide Web founder Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned that the internet's power for good is being 'under threat', as it has been 'subverted' by those spreading hatred and threatening democracy.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/wire-20330444-1572360276-819_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
