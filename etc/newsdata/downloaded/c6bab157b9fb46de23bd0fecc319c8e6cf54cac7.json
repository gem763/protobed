Longtime SNL cast member Kenan Thompson spoke from the heart about how much Chappelle\u2019s comedy has influenced him: \u201cYour fearlessness to entertain the way that you want to has definitely pierced my life, to the point where I played a werewolf choreographer last night.\u201d Bradley Cooper said some sincere words about how Chappelle inspires him as a father: \u201cMy daughter\u2019s [backstage], and I\u2019m just so grateful, Dave, that I got to meet you before I had my daughter. Because you taught me how to be a better man, and you teach me how to be a better man.\u201d Jon Stewart even vividly recalled how it felt to be working at Comedy Central when Chappelle abruptly quit Chappelle\u2019s Show: \u201cComedy Central would do anything to keep it going, and they offered Dave 50 million dollars. \u2018Just give us one more [season]!\u2019 But Dave, at that moment, was conflicted, because of the difficulty of how the show was to do, because he wondered about its impact on the audience that he meant it for, and he wondered if the creative process wasn\u2019t right for it. And he walked away. And it was at that moment that I remember thinking: Comedy Central has 50 million dollars?\u201d\n\nBut the best tribute of the night belonged to Neal Brennan, Chappelle\u2019s longtime writing partner and co-creator of Chappelle\u2019s Show. For more than 14 minutes, a lot of which will presumably be cut from the TV broadcast for time, Brennan talked about their partnership, the failure of their movie collaboration on Half Baked, their work on Chappelle\u2019s Show, and how much he values their personal and professional relationship. It was very funny, and vivid, and also offered some behind-the-scenes dirt about Half Baked, which is obviously what we all came to hear.\n\nHere are some excerpts from the speech. See more of it \u2014 or maybe just different parts of it \u2014 when the Mark Twain Prize ceremony airs on PBS on January 6.\n\nIn 1997, Dave calls me and goes, \u201cHey, if Universal reaches out to you, tell them we\u2019re writing a weed movie together.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat weed movie?\u201d Dave said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Looking back, it made sense that the origins of a weed movie sound pretty much like you\u2019d imagine.\n\nNext thing I know, someone from Universal calls me and asks, \u201cAre you making a weed movie with Dave Chappelle?\u201d And I was like, \u201cYes?\u201d And they were like, \u201cWhen can you pitch it to us?\u201d And I was like, \u201cIn 30 days\u2019 time.\u201d So we had a month to work the pitch out. Finally, on day 29, I called Dave. I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, we got to work this weed movie out.\u201d And he goes, \u201cWhat weed movie?\u201d\n\nWe got to January of 1998. Half Baked opened against Good Will Hunting, Wag the Dog, As Good As It Gets, and, oh yeah, Titanic. It was a critical and commercial flop, and quite frankly, wasn\u2019t very good.\n\nA couple of years later, after the stink wore off both professionally and personally, Dave and I were on the phone again, which was a thing people used to do. And he says to me, \u201cHey, man. We should do a TV show like Playboy After Dark.\u201d Now if you remember what Playboy After Dark was, get your affairs in order because you\u2019re on death\u2019s door. If you don\u2019t remember Playboy After Dark, it was a super laid-back TV show in the 1970s, hosted by Hugh Hefner, who was a magazine publisher and mild sex trafficker. Imagine Jeffrey Epstein with a grotto. [At this point, Chappelle is laughing so hard, he gets out of his chair and walks halfway out of the box where he is sitting.] Anyway, Dave\u2019s idea was what would come to be Chappelle\u2019s Show. We went around pitching to a few networks. HBO didn\u2019t go great. The woman actually said to Dave, and I quote: \u201cWhy do we need you when we have Chris Rock?\u201d See, back then there could only be one popular black comedian at a time. Unlike today, when there can be three.\n\nWe trudged up Sixth Avenue in the New York summer heat on the way to our next pitch. I remember looking over at Dave and feeling crazy. Do you remember that? I felt crazy because he\u2019s so funny and I couldn\u2019t understand why people weren\u2019t falling over themselves to work with him. So then, a few minutes later, we pitched at Comedy Central and they bought it. We made the pilot for Chappelle\u2019s Show, we got picked up to series, and the show went really well. Like, absurdly well. Like, so well, you gotta go to Africa well.\n\nWhen we started the show, I knew Dave was the funniest person I\u2019d ever met. By the end of the show, I knew Dave was one of the funniest people who\u2019d ever lived. I think he even surprised himself with how funny he was. There were times where he would just improvise something that we had never talked about before, that he\u2019d maybe never even thought about before. Clayton Bigsby\u2019s entire speech about breathing the white man\u2019s air, and Will & Grace, and if you have hate in your heart, let it out, white power: all made up. I have to say, saying \u201cwhite power\u201d in this room didn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\nTyrone Biggums\u2019s speech to the kids about doing drugs with Mickey Mouse: totally made up. And that\u2019s just the first two episodes of the show. So much of it was just completely off the top of his head. Rick James saying \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration\u201d and \u201cFuck yo couch\u201d and five fingers hitting the face. Black George Bush telling Kofi Annan that he should be in Times Square selling fake hats. Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan. He made it all up.\n\nWriting and directing Dave sometimes was as simple as me standing onstage with my jaw hanging open, going, \u201cUh, cut?\u201d Also, the show was personal. Scores were settled, axes got ground, even toward me. See, I always felt like Dave blamed me for the failure of Half Baked. One day, we were shooting a sketch where Dave quits the show because he got Oprah pregnant, and we\u2019re doing a scene where he\u2019s rampaging through the offices. And he gets to me and he dumps trash on my head. Here\u2019s why I suspect he blamed me for Half Baked: As he dumped the trash over my head, he said, \u201cThis is for Half Baked.\u201d\n\n[Chappelle stands up and shouts something to Brennan.]\n\nHe claims that I actually wrote that line and told him to say it. Which is the only time this entire evening that I\u2019ll be receiving credit for Chappelle\u2019s Show. It\u2019s not my night. It\u2019s his night.\n\nThe thing that I love about Chappelle\u2019s Show is that it allowed Dave to be his entire self, to express his intellect, his anger, his morality, his silliness, his hypocrisies, his sadness, his blazing talent. Chappelle\u2019s Show was a rare thing. It was a fully faceted document of a human being living in the United States of America while having the surreal experience of being born with black skin.
