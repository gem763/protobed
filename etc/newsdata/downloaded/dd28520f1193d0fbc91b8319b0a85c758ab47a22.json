Like his performance\".\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nAnother French rugby account branded it \"disturbing\" with others labelling it \"embarrassing\" and \"unimaginable\".\n\nNeutral fans also branded it \"not wise at all\" and \"completely unprofessional\".\n\nThe red card proved a key moment in the game as a late Ross Moriarty try saw Wales edge a 20-19 win to book a semi-final against Peyper's home nation, South Africa, next weekend.\n\nPeyper showed no hesitation in giving the red card after being shown replays of the incident on the big screen in Oita.\n\nHe said: \"It's very clear. You all think that's a red card?\"\n\nThen explaining his decision to the player and French skipper, Peyper said: \"The first action is around the neck, then you take your arm away and deliberately you hit with the elbow in the head.\"\n\nFew had any qualms with the decision to give Vahaamahina a straight red, with Wales legend Gareth Thomas amongst those to back the decision in the ITV Studio.\n\nHe said: \"As he's walking off and he's apologising to his players, don't apologise now, it's too late.\n\n\"That's an intentional act of violence, and there is no place for that on the rugby field.\n\n\"An apology to me, I'd rather you just walk off. Take that shame and walk off because you deserve the shame of it.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"It's not a very nice feeling being sent off and walking that kind of walk of shame but when you do something like that, that's so intentional, and so vicious, then you deserve all the negativity that comes with that walking off.\"\n\nPeyper will find out this week if he will have further involvement in the tournament, with officials for the semi-finals set to be announced later this week.\n\nHe will not be able to take charge of Wales' semi-final due to his nation, South Africa, being the opponents but he could have a role in England's game with New Zealand.", "description": "The referee at the centre of Wales' Rugby World Cup 2019 quarter-final win over France has caused controversy", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Twitter", "Pa", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662362.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-20-at-221703.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
