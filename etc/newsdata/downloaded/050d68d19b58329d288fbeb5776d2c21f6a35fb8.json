The healthcare sector <.SPXHC>, which has been the second-worst performer among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors this year, rose 1.16% as the best performer on the session as Merck gained 3.5% and Pfizer advanced 2.5%.\n\nBut shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc <GOOGL.O>, however, lost 2.20% and weighed on the Nasdaq as its quarterly profit missed estimates due to higher costs.\n\nThird-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies have largely been better than expected, with over 77% of the 236 firms to report so far surpassing profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data. Still, earnings are expected to decline by 1.9% for the quarter.\n\nOther big names reporting this week include tech and internet heavyweights Apple Inc <AAPL.O> and Facebook Inc <FB.O>, as well as oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp <XOM.N> and Chevron Corp <CVX.N>.\n\nThe focus now shifts to the Fed meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to deliver a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut for the third time this year.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 20.04 points, or 0.07%, to 27,070.68, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 2.54 points, or 0.08%, to 3,036.88 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 49.14 points, or 0.59%, to 8,276.85.\n\nThe S&P earlier in the session reached a high of 3,047.87, its second straight intraday record.\n\nGeneral Motors Co <GM.N> gained 4.28% after its quarterly net profit topped estimates, but the carmaker slashed its earnings forecast for 2019 as the 40-day U.S. labor strike by the United Auto Workers union brought virtually all of its North American operations to a standstill.\n\nBeyond Meat Inc <BYND.O> tumbled 22.22% as the vegan burger maker said it would need to offer more store discounts amid rising competition.\n\nShares of GrubHub Inc <GRUB.N> plunged 43.30% after the online food delivery company warned of slowing growth as customers opted to choose from a growing pool of rival providers.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 95 new highs and 69 new lows.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Jonathan Oatis)", "description": "The S&P 500 edged lower to snap a four-session win streak on Tuesday and it retreated from a record high as investors grappled with a flood of earnings and the latest update on a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China.
