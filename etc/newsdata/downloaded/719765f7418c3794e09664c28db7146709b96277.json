Ukraine's president says to media his country won't be pressured into opening an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)\n\nZHYTOMYR, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General said on Friday that his office is reviewing all the cases that were closed by his predecessors, including several related to the owner of a gas company where former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son sat on the board.\n\nRuslan Ryaboshapka\u2019s comments came amid an impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump that relates to a call he made to the Ukrainian president asking him to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate and his son\u2019s work in Ukraine.\n\nRyaboshapka told reporters in Kyiv that prosecutors are auditing all the cases that were closed or dismissed by former prosecutors, including several related to Mykola Zlochevsky, owner of the gas company Burisma that hired Hunter Biden in 2014, at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv.\n\nThough the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.\n\n\u201cWe are now reviewing all the cases that were closed or split into several parts or were investigated before, in order to be able to rule to reverse those cases where illegal procedural steps were taken,\u201d Ryaboshapka said.\n\nAsked by The Associated Press about Trump\u2019s comment Thursday that the U.S. has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases, Zelenskiy said that Ukraine is \u201copen\u201d and that all the cases under investigation are \u201ctransparent.\u201d\n\nThe Prosecutor General\u2019s Office later said that among the cases they are reviewing, there are 15 where Zlochevsky is mentioned. None of the Zlochevsky-related cases has been revived yet, they said.\n\nThey did not specify how many, if any, were related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work at Burisma.\n\nRyaboshapka was mentioned in the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who assured Trump that Ryaboshapka was \u201chis man\u201d and that he would resume investigations into Burisma.\n\nThe prosecutor general insisted on Friday that he did not feel any pressure over the Burisma case.\n\n\u201cNot a single foreign or Ukrainian official or politician has called me or tried to influence my decisions regarding specific criminal cases,\u201d he said.\n\nA whistleblower last month revealed that Trump in a phone call asked Zelenskiy to resume the probe into Joe Biden and his son. The July 25 call has since triggered an impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\n___\n\nNataliya Vasilyeva contributed to this report from Moscow.", "description": "Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General says that his office is reviewing all the cases that were closed by his predecessors, including several ones related to the owner of a gas company where former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son sat on the board.
