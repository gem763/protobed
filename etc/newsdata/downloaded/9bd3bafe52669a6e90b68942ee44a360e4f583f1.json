But according to the report the statements were designed to obscure the real source of the leaks: Russian intelligence.\n\nFox News eventually retracted the story after widespread criticism a week after its publication, but it had been pushed by network hosts including Sean Hannity.\n\nIn a lawsuit in 2018 Rich's parents, Joel and Mary Rich, said that Fox's promotion of the conspiracy had caused them serious distress and anxiety. But a judge in the Southern District of New York dismissed the lawsuit. Friday's court of appeals decision overturns that ruling, reported Reuters Friday.\n\nThe family is suing Fox News, Malia Zimmerman, who reported the retracted story, and Ed Butowsky, and Texas businessman and former unpaid Fox News contributor for emotional distress.\n\nFox News in a statement disputed the Rich family's allegations.\n\n\"The court's ruling today permits Mr. and Mrs. Rich to proceed with discovery to determine whether there is a factual basis for their claims against FOX News,\" the network said in a statement. \"And While we extend the Rich family our deepest condolences for their loss, we believe that discovery will demonstrate that FOX News did not engage in conduct that will support the Riches' claims. We will be evaluating our next legal steps.\"\n\nZimmerman has declined to comment through a Fox News spokesperson, reported CNN.\n\nTy Clevenger, a lawyer for Butowsky, told CNN he is \"confident we can prove that the allegations are false.\"\n\nIn a statement to NPR, Joel and Mary Rich said, \"We would not wish what we have experienced upon any other parent - anywhere. We appreciate the appellate court's ruling and look forward to continuing to pursue justice.\"", "description": "The family of DNC staffer Seth Rich claim that Fox News' publication of a report pushing conspiracy theories about his death caused them serious distress.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ca5e72e22af15d8799c34-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
