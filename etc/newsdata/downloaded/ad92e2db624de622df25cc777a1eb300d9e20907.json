Scott Applewhite/AP Photo congress McCarthy defends military stopovers at Trump's Scottish resort: 'It's just like any other hotel'\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday defended military expenditures at President Donald Trump\u2019s properties, arguing that hotels owned by the president are \u201cjust like any other hotel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president's resorts are hotels that he owns. People are traveling. It's just like any other hotel. I know people will look at it, I don't know if that\u2019s different than anything else,\u201d he said at a press conference.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s defense comes as the Air Force has launched a global review of its layover policy following a POLITICO report that crews have made multiple stays at Trump's luxury seaside Turnberry golf resort in Scotland, an unusual stop for crews heading to and from the Middle East.\n\nOn Friday, POLITICO revealed that the House Oversight Committee began looking into the peculiar uptick in fueling stops at a small commercial airport servicing the hotel this April after an Air Force crew stayed overnight at Trump's resort weeks earlier.\n\nThe Air Force has said that while they are reviewing the stays, they appeared to adhere to existing procedures. It said that in the future it will look to see whether it\u2019s appropriate for its crews to stay at properties owned by the commander in chief.\n\nSince then, POLITICO has uncovered at least four instances when Air Force crews stayed at Turnberry dating back to September 2018, totaling more than 60 service members who have stayed at the posh property.\n\nAccusations that Trump\u2019s properties are unfairly profiting off of his administration have dogged the president since he entered office in 2017. Trump still owns his business but placed his holdings in a trust designed to hold assets for his benefit. He can receive money from the trust at any time.\n\nEthics officials and lawmakers have raised concerns about foreign officials staying at Trump hotels, noting that Trump supporters and industry groups regularly hold events at Trump-owned locations. An analysis conducted by The Washington Post earlier this summer found that Trump\u2019s properties had brought in $1.6 million in revenue from federal officials and Republicans who paid to be near the president.\n\nMcCarthy asserted Tuesday that shouldn\u2019t be looked down upon either. \u201cIs it different than if I go to eat or stay at a Marriott here or eat at the Trump?\u201d he asked, adding: \u201cThe president isn't asking me to, he's competing in a private enterprise. It's nothing he controls in that process, so if it's in the process, they can stay there, yes.\u201d\n\nTrump is also considering hosting next year\u2019s G-7 summit of world leaders at his Doral resort in Miami, a potential financial boon for the property, and has previously stayed at Turnberry property during an official visit to the United Kingdom.\n\nRevenue increased by $3.1 million at Turnberry in 2018, which Trump visited in July of that year, according to Trump\u2019s most recent personal financial disclosure forms.\n\nLast week, Vice President Mike Pence raised eyebrows when he stayed at Trump\u2019s resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, during a visit there, despite its location hundreds of miles away from his meetings in Dublin. The Oversight Committee is investigating that stay as well, and the president has denied playing any role in either situation.\n\n", "description": "Revenue at Trump's Turnberry resort increased by $3.1 million in 2018.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/44/69/5365a68a48daacb684b2904126df/190910-kevin-mccarthy-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
