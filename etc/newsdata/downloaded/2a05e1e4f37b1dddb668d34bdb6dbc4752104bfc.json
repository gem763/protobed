A shirt for sale on her website features that phrase on the back.\n\nRaisen said he\u2019d reached out to Lizzo\u2019s team asking for credit, but that he was \u201cshut down every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cComing forward publicly to family, friends, artists and colleagues seems to be the only way at this point in relieving some of our emotional distress caused by this,\u201d he wrote in the caption. \u201cThe last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo\u2019s momentum and movement as a cultural figure.\u201d\n\nRaisen said Lioness\u2019 tweet did inspire the line in \u201cHealthy\u201d as a meme of the phrase came up during their writing session. He wrote that he and his brother would \u201cshare some of the proceeds with Mina\u201d if they succeed in getting a share of the \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d money.\n\nCynthia Arato, a lawyer for Lizzo, told The Associated Press that the Raisens \u201care not the writers\u201d of the song.\n\n\u201cThey did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago,\u201d Arato told the AP.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The truth about \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d could hurt Lizzo\u2019s wallet.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/lizzo-BET-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
