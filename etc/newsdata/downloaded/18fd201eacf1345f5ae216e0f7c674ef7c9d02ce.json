Kids are always cruel to anyone who looks different, so I had it rough.\n\n\"I really liked this girl at my school. She was very popular, and all the guys thought she was the hottest girl in our grade.\n\n\"I thought she was really pretty, and I must have been crazy, but I decided I'd ask her to the school dance.\n\n(Image: TRANSFORM YOUR FUTURE / CATERS NEWS)\n\n\"It was my final year of school, and I just thought 'why not?'. I was anticipating for her to reject me straight away and just laugh in my face.\n\n\"But amazingly, she said yes, I couldn't believe it. I was so excited for the dance that I bought a new suit, got a haircut and hired a limo.\n\n\"I wanted to impress her. I nervously drove to her house, walked up and rang the bell. She opened it and just said 'sorry, you're too fat to fit through the door' and slammed the door in my face.\n\n\"I was heartbroken. I went back to the limo and cried my eyes out. But then I gathered myself, and thought well, you have a suit on so you might as well go to the dance.\n\n\"But I had a terrible time, and everyone laughed and bullied me when they found out what happened. It was horrible.\n\n\"I sank into a major depression after that, which lasted years after high school ended. I never thought anyone could love me and that I'd be alone forever.\"\n\nAnthony said his rocky start in life that saw him get put into foster care at age 13 was the underlying cause of his overeating and weight gain.\n\nAddicted to fast food, he would consume two footlong meatball subs with a large bottle of coke for breakfast, while lunch would consist of a burger meal from KFC and a packet of Magnum ice creams.\n\nThen for dinner, Anthony would gorge on two large pizzas and another two-litre bottle of coke - meaning he was consuming around 10,000 calories per day.\n\nHis poor diet took a toll on his health, and in 2014 Anthony's doctor warned he was on the verge of developing type two diabetes.\n\nWith his health on the line - along with the fear that he might never find love due to being obese - Anthony decided to make a change that would transform his life.\n\n(Image: TRANSFORM YOUR FUTURE / CATERS NEWS)\n\nHe said: \"I didn't know how to eat properly and didn't care. I was addicted to fast food.\n\n\"I never thought about my health until my doctor said I was about to get diabetes. I broke down in tears and realised I needed to change my life.\n\n\"I stopped eating fast food and began cooking for myself. I also stepped foot into a gym for the first time back in 2014 and haven't looked back.\"\n\nAnthony has since opened his own personal training business called 'Transform Your Future' in order to help those who are in the same position that he was five years ago.\n\nAnd since losing weight, Anthony revealed that he has been contacted by people who rejected him in high school for being fat - including the girl who pulled the cruel prank before the school dance.\n\nHe said: \"When I was fat, I hated myself and never thought anyone could love me. All I wanted was to have a partner and family, so that really motivated me to lose weight.\n\n(Image: TRANSFORM YOUR FUTURE / CATERS NEWS)\n\n\"I was always rejected and would get laughed at when I approached girls. But now women are asking me on dates all the time.\n\n\"I went from having three matches on Tinder when I was fat, to now having over 1,000 matches with girls. It's crazy.\n\n\"Then about a year ago, that same girl who was so cruel to me before our school formal, somehow got my number through my Instagram page and sent me a text apologising for being a bully and asked if we could go on a date.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it and didn't even reply. I'll forgive, but I would never forget.\n\n\"I've gone through a lot, but my experiences have made me the man I am today. My message to is just never give up, even when everything seems hopeless.\n\n\"My goal now is to help others who have been through the same things I have. If I can do it, anyone can do it.\n\n\"I feel so much happier about life and I'm looking forward to the future.\"", "description": "Anthony Bayer, 26, was rejected by girls throughout his teen years for being obese and would burst out of his 3XL shirts", "authors": ["Jasmine Kazlauskas", "Image", "Transform Your Future", "Caters News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464077.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-WEIGHT-LOSS-REJECTION-PAYBACK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
