While on the surface it might appear to be one of the thousands of idiotic attacks on a Trump supporter we see on social media every day, this one provides a window into what the left has done to the very people they claim to support and champion.\n\nIn her tweets, Ms. Navratilova publicly accused Mr. Grenell of being \u201csick\u201d and okay with the \u201cslaughter of civilians.\u201d One would think to tweet something so awful at someone she must have seen a comment revealing some sort of monstrous inhumanity.\n\nBut no. The tennis legend was responding in the bizarre unhinged fashion to a very moving message from Mr. Grenell about his partner\u2019s visit to Normandy with his grandfather: He tweeted, \u201cIn Normandy, where a hero Grandfather tells his grandson what it was like to be a 19 yr old Ohio teenager arriving in France to fight the Nazis. @mattlashey and Merle Lashey are lucky. So many buried here never got to have a family. #sacrifice #freedomisntfree\u201d\n\nMs. Navratilova\u2019s response? \u201cYou tweet this while our troops are under fire thanks to your guy trump? Have you any idea about what is going on in Syria now? #crickets\u201d\n\nMr. Grenell, who is known for being honest and direct, was both in his response to her attack: \u201cMy 95 yr old grandfather visits Normandy for the first time after he landed there as a 19 yr old teenager and you ridicule his moment? Seek help immediately! You have #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #greatestgeneration\u201d\n\nThe response is what we\u2019ve all grown to expect from those who see everything through the prism of their hatred for President Trump:\n\n\u201cThink about the timing,\u201d she tweeted back. \u201cI am not the sick one here- I thank your grandfather for fighting for our country. Same cannot be said for you. But I guess you\u2019re ok with the slaughter of civilians in Syria thanks to your guy\u2026 ?#Impeach45\u201d\n\nAnd there it is, all boiling down for her as a sad virtue signaling to the left that she\u2019s thinking correctly, and can be trusted to parrot the narrative.\n\nWe all know the ambassador\u2019s work and his history, and it\u2019s safe to say Ms. Navratilova does, too. He is not only our representative in Germany, but he has also recently been appointed as our special U.S. envoy to the Serbia and Kosovo peace talks. Moreover, he is leading the Trump administration\u2019s project to decriminalize homosexuality around the globe.\n\nAs a testament to what the left does to the very people they claim to represent, Ms. Navratilova has been reduced to sniping at another gay person who is actually doing work to improve the lives of everyone, and working to, literally, save the lives of gay people in countries that remain determined to imprison and even kill them.\n\nWhat\u2019s especially sad in this exchange is it illustrates how the left creates a void of common decency, including in Ms. Navratilova, who is arguably one of the greatest athletes of the modern era. As an openly gay woman, she also has served as an inspiration and role model for many.\n\nBut her bizarre and disconnected attack on Mr. Grenell can be explained, I contend, as part of her continuing effort to prove her fealty to the left\u2019s Trump-hating leftist overlords. Earlier this year she committed the crime of expressing an unapproved opinion, and was targeted by the rabid left for disappearance and cancellation.\n\nHer crime? In a Sunday Times of London opinion piece in February of this year, Ms. Navratilova wrote of her opposition to transgendered women competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\nThe 18-time Grand Slam champion immediately came under an attack meant to destroy her work and reputation. She has been labeled as \u201ctransphobic,\u201d removed from an LGBTQ non-profit she served on, and remains the target of disparaging commentary by leftists and activists. She herself noted in the offending op-ed the \u201cgrowing tendency\u201d of transgendered activists to \u201cdenounce anyone who argues against them and to label them all as \u2018transphobes,\u2019\u201d which she declared was another form of \u201ctyranny,\u201d according to a report by NBC News.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened. After unrelenting efforts to \u2018cancel\u2019 her, Ms. Navratilova eventually apologized and then in June, an Outsports headline confirmed the re-education of Martina: \u201c\u2018Perhaps I don\u2019t know as much as I thought!\u2019 Martina Navratilova talks about her new trans athlete documentary. The tennis legend who once called trans women \u2018cheaters\u2019 hints that she may be more open-minded now.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to attacking Mr. Grenell on social media for celebrating his World War II grandfather as an excuse to rage against Mr. Trump. Ms. Navratilova appears to still be trying to prove herself to her \u2018community\u2019 punishers. Moreover, the strategy of the bullies on the left to destroy an icon like her is meant to send a message to every other liberal: Don\u2019t you dare step out of line or you will pay a horrible price.\n\nThis from people who scream every day that Donald Trump and conservatives are the threat to personal freedom.\n\n\u2022 Tammy Bruce, president of Independent Women\u2019s Voice, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk-show host.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
