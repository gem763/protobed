(Rachel Luna/Getty Images)\n\nWhy are we so obsessed with watching real estate-focused reality TV shows?\n\nWith HGTV scheduled to launch 24 new series in 2019 alone, not including the shows being launched by other networks and streaming services, I wanted to know why so many of us are captivated with watching other people renovate, decorate, upsize, downsize, flip, flop, love it, or list it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s \u2014 I was barely 20 years old (yes, I am in my 50s now) \u2014 I was hooked on watching Bob Vila, the host of \u201cThis Old House\u201d demonstrate how to cut ceramic tile or install a bathroom faucet. \u201cThis Old House\u201d is one of the earliest home improvement shows aired on national television. I purchased my first home when I was 26 years old. It needed a renovation. I wasn\u2019t about to cut tile or install a faucet on my own, yet I watched with intrigue.\n\nToday, HGTV is the third-most-watched cable network, with more than 38 million viewers tuning in each month. The new series \u201cA Very Brady Renovation\u201d was the highest-rated series premiere in HGTV\u2019s history, with 8.1 million viewers.\n\n[More Chodorov Kaminsky: Enticed by low mortgage rates? Here are other factors you should weigh when determining whether to buy.]\n\n\u201cOur programming is the comfort food of TV,\u201d Kathleen Finch, chief lifestyle brands officer at Discovery, said in a phone interview. \u201cNobody dies, nobody gets hurt.\u201d\n\nFinch oversees the management of HGTV, Food Network, TLC, ID, Travel Channel, DIY Network, Cooking Channel, Discovery Life, American Heroes Channel, Destination America, Great American Country and the company\u2019s Digital Studios Group in the United States.\n\nHGTV\u2019s top-rated series include \u201cFlip or Flop,\u201d \u201cProperty Brothers: Forever Home,\u201d \u201cGood Bones,\u201d \u201cMy Lottery Dream House,\u201d \u201cIsland Hunters,\u201d \u201cHawaii Hunters\u201d and \"Mexico Life,\u201d said Audrey Adlam, senior vice president of communications for HGTV, DIY Network and Great American Country.\n\nIs it the real estate aspect of these shows that is so enticing? Or is it the personalities and the drama that keep us coming back? I asked.\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d Finch said. \u201cViewers love our talent. They can\u2019t walk down the street without being mobbed.\n\n\u201cViewers also love the real estate,\u201d Finch added. \u201cWe give them something to dream about.\u201d\n\nOwning a home is the American Dream. Whether you are a first-time buyer or a serial homeowner, there is nothing like the feeling of being handed the keys to your new home. There is nothing like walking into your home for the first time, lying down on the bare wood floors and doing the angel dance. (Yes, I do that every time I buy a property, and I recommend it to all my buyer clients.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve never purchased a home, real estate-focused reality shows are aspirational.\n\n\u201cWe live vicariously through the experiences of reality TV stars,\u201d said Nelson Marban, an agent with Washington Fine Properties in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of playing house with people that aren\u2019t in a room with you.\u201d\n\nMarban will be featured in an episode of a new HGTV series, \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Money Worth,\u201d to be aired in November. The episode is a reenactment of his experience helping one of his clients find and purchase a home.\n\n\u201cMost of these shows are not shot live,\u201d Marban said. \u201cIt would be too expensive.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the element of re-creation can be seen as fake. But, he said, from his experience, the reenactment was very factual.\n\nMarban did confess that he is not a fan of real estate reality shows.\n\n\u201cThey create a lot of expectation in the eyes of the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cI have had clients want a flashy party like the ones on \u2018Million Dollar Listing.\u2019 \u201d I have to tell them that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\n\n[More Chodorov Kaminsky: Don\u2019t get hosed when looking for a plumber]\n\nThese unrealistic expectations are common among home buyers nationwide.\n\n\u201cI have actually had new buyer clients ask me if I was going to show them only three houses before they had to make a decision,\u201d said Terri Hess, an agent with Coldwell Banker in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nIn the HGTV series \u201cHouse Hunters,\u201d buyers are shown three homes and must select one to purchase. In real life, the buyer has already visited multiple listings and is under contract to purchase their home of choice.\n\n\u201cWe are in the entertainment business,\u201d Finch said, when asked about the criticism of HGTV\u2019s programming. \u201cWe celebrate family, the American Dream; we take the old and sad and make it lovely; we make people feel good.\u201d\n\nThere is no question that we all need lighthearted and uplifting entertainment these days.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of bad news,\u201d said Mike Aubrey, the former host of HGTV\u2019s \u201cGet It Sold\u201d and a real estate agent with Compass in Bethesda, Md. \u201cThese programs give viewers an escape into something that gives them a full and happy heart. People need comfort.\u201d\n\nI may not be able to clamp a two-by-four to a sawhorse and subjugate a jigsaw into making a perfectly clean cut \u2014 as Bob Vila hoped I would \u2014 but I am a back-seat driver to every regretful contractor I have hired.
