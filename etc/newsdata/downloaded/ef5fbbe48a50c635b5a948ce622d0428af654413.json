It also destroyed $5 million worth of military-style rifles it had in its inventory.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the company to feel the effects: Sales plunged.\n\n\u201cWe were really thoughtful on how we would go about doing this, and we thought that it would have an impact of about a quarter of a billion dollars on our sales,\" which amount to more than $8 billion, he said. \"And when we got done with that year, it was pretty much what we thought.\u201d\n\nBut Stack says the reaction by gun owners to the moves wasn\u2019t as negative as the sales numbers might indicate.\n\n\u201cThere's been people who are gun owners who are very upset with us -- and that impacted our business, we knew that it would,\u201d he said.\n\nBut there are also gun owners who have told store personnel, \"'I agree with what you\u2019ve done. We continue to support you; we're continuing to do business with you,'\" Stack added. \"So it's pretty fractured on how people feel.\u201d\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % DKS DICKS SPORTING 39.41 +0.21 +0.54%\n\nStack told FOX Business the cost to the company from from limiting gun sales was worthwhile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve moved the conversation [on gun violence] forward,\u201d Stack said\n\n\u201cI think right now -- and a lot of people would agree with this -- there\u2019s not a lot of leadership coming out of Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the country\u2019s thirsting for leadership to come from someplace. And in a lot of cases right now, it\u2019s coming from the private sector.\u201d\n\nWhat Stack is hoping for is action from Congress and the White House.\n\n\u201cToday, 90 percent of the American people support expanded background checks, and I don\u2019t know why we can't get that done.\" - Ed Stack, Chairman and CEO of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods\n\nHouse Democrats passed a bill requiring background checks for gun sales between private parties, which were previously exempt, and \"I was one of the CEOs who signed on a letter encouraging them to do that,\" Stack said. The bill has now moved to the Senate, where it's sitting on Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's desk, he added. \"I hope he will bring it to the floor and have a vote and a debate about it.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack says his company has helped make up for the lack of leadership from Washington on gun violence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/DICK-S-Sporting-Goods.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
