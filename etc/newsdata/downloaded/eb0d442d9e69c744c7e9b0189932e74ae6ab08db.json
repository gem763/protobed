First-time buyers are exempt from paying stamp duty if their purchase costs less than \u00a3500,000.\n\n\n\nThe number of cash buyers has declined most significantly in cities with the highest capital values and lowest yields, the report said, mainly encompassing London and surrounding southern cities.\n\n\n\nThe number of cash buyers dropped most in Cambridge, down 30% since 2016, followed by London and Oxford.\n\n\n\nOnly Aberdeen and Liverpool saw a rise in cash buyers since 2016.\n\nFrom Penta: Good Company: Houdini Sportswear\u2019s Drive Toward Sustainable Innovation\n\n\u201cA change in the mix of buyers has impacted the demand for housing across cities since 2016,\u201d Richard Donnell, research and insight director at Zoopla, said in the report. \u201cThe reduction in cash buyers has been marked in southern cities and we believe this is down to a decline in investment-buying across high value cities. This has compounded the slowdown in price rises, which we see as a return to a more sustainable pace of price growth rather than an impending re-correction.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, demand from mortgaged home-owners appears resilient, supported by low mortgage rates and high levels of employment, Mr. Donnell said.\n\n\n\nThe average property price across the 20 U.K. cities Zoopla analyzed stood at \u00a3257,900 in August, a 1.9% rise from a year ago.\n\n\n\nGrowth was highest in Leicester, in the East Midlands, where values are 4.8% higher than they were last year. Liverpool, in North West England, followed, where property prices rose 4.6% in the same time.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-111431?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
