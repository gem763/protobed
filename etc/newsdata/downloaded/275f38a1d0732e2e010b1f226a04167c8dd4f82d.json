It\u2019s the latest struggle for his former tech worker owner.", "language": "en", "text": "He spent years in the Northern Virginia tech industry, but the bustle of the Washington region wore him down. He eventually settled with his family on 74 rolling acres in rural Virginia, trading traffic and gridlock for serenity and livestock.\n\nCountry life hasn\u2019t been without challenges. After relocating about 50 miles south of Charlottesville in 2017, the Cissells lived in an RV with four kids under age 9 while rebuilding a moldy farmhouse and almost lost their youngest member to an E. coli infection. Cissell survived a yak attack.\n\nIt\u2019s also where he raised Meteor, a scheming male yak whose latent jailbreaking power earned him two-week Internet acclaim last month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sept. 10, Meteor, one of more than two dozen yaks on the farm, was headed to a butcher when he slipped the bonds of a livestock trailer at a stop sign and escaped into the mountains. As the Internet delighted in his freedom, Cissell searched for days, establishing a perimeter and setting a trap baited with sweet seed, Meteor\u2019s favorite treat.\n\nBut Cissell, who quit his tech job last year to farm full-time, needed to chop Meteor up into $2,000 worth of meat \u2014 or see the fledgling farm take a major financial hit.\n\nThe efforts were for naught. After about two weeks on the lam, Meteor was struck by a vehicle on Route 29 and euthanized. Cissell brought the animal back home to Nature\u2019s Bridge Farm in Buckingham County, Va., where he was laid to rest in a wooded clearing.\n\nAD\n\nFarming isn\u2019t easy, but hope springs eternal.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven though I\u2019m new to this, I can keep working at, accept that I\u2019m going to make mistakes along the way,\u201d Cissell said. \u201cEventually I can make this succeed.\u201d\n\n'Life as I hadn't seen it before'\n\nHarrison Pollack, 20, arrived at the Charlottesville City Market on a recent Saturday craving organ meat.\n\nThe University of Virginia student is on a health kick, trying to improve his cognitive abilities by consuming foods high in B vitamins. He was chasing livers, kidneys, hearts and other offal at the Nature\u2019s Bridge Farm stand, where Cissell was selling his wares with wife, Mackenzie Cissell, as their children Rylan, 9, Noa, 7, Charlotte, 4, and Remy, 3, swarmed about.\n\nAD\n\nWearing a \u201cGot Yak?\u201d T-shirt, Pollack marched up to Robert Cissell. \u201cI love this man,\u201d the student said.\n\nLove demanded dialogue. Pollack wanted to know the age of the yaks whose body parts he was buying and discuss methods for obviating the smell of urine that comes with cooking kidneys. He was ready to discuss American prejudices against eating animals \u201cnose to tail\u201d and myriad bone broths.\n\nCissell took his time with the conversation, selling Pollack $53 worth of meat. These are the types of transactions he\u2019s sought since Michael Pollan\u2019s local food manifesto \u201cThe Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma\u201d moved him to try small-scale farming about a decade ago, when he left Northern Virginia to try farming in Arkansas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to know our customers personally,\u201d Cissell said. \u201cYou get to where you know their story, they know yours. You\u2019re explaining why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing and how you\u2019re doing it \u2026 and a higher percentage of people are paying more attention to where their food is coming from.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNature\u2019s Bridge Farm is also home to Mackenzie Cissell\u2019s Farming Artist business, the brand under which she sells vinyl stickers \u2014 agriculture-related and not \u2014 for about $5 each. In Charlottesville, she had goat, pig and chicken stickers next to lion, octopus and \u201cPride\u201d stickers.\n\nThough traveling to Charlottesville meant packing their four children into two vehicles at 6 a.m., along with tables, a tent and two coolers for the hour-long car ride, Saturday was a good day. The Cissells earned $1,177 before expenses \u2014 $763 from Mackenzie and $414 from Robert.\n\n\u201cIt does really well,\u201d Mackenzie Cissell, 31, said of the Farming Artist. \u201cI\u2019m getting a pretty good following. A lot of it has to do with the story.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd this was the strange truth of Nature\u2019s Bridge Farm: Mackenzie can make more money selling stickers about farming than Robert can make farming.\n\nAD\n\nHer vocation requires paints, a computer and an Instagram account. His requires dozens of ruminants weighing at least 700 pounds each, pasture rotation, 1,000 pounds of hay every three days, fencing, veterinarians and building relationships with a small cohort of yak farmers around the country.\n\nDespite the challenges, a few proud agrarians can\u2019t quit yaks.\n\nCissell says Ken Zlotkowski is Virginia\u2019s only other yak farmer, and Zlotkowski agrees. A former Environmental Protection Agency employee, he started a herd of up to 20 animals in 2001 at his 70-acre farm in Powhatan, Va., before he retired.\n\nAD\n\nZlotkowski said he was drawn to yaks because of their lean, tasty meat \u2014 \u201cIf somebody served it to you, you probably wouldn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t a steak,\u201d he said \u2014 and because each animal has its own \u201cyakinality,\u201d or yak personality.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSome want to come up and are friendly, others are standoffish, others are curious about everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a lot of fun to watch.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I could have made a living off it, I would have,\u201d Zlotkowski said.\n\nYaks have also bewitched Cissell.\n\nHe and Mackenzie met years ago when she worked with his brother at a Manassas bookstore, and they started dating in 2013. Cissell decamped from his 20 acres in Arkansas, and the new couple bought a house the next year in southern Virginia. Mackenzie Cissell left her job with the Rappahannock County (Va.) School District, where she was in line to become the finance director, for a slower lifestyle on 15 acres.\n\n\u201cIt was my dream house, really,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was beautiful. Combined with the amount of acreage at the time, it was a compromise. It was something I could live in comfortably, but was a way for Robert to do farming comfortably.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRobert Cissell, however, wanted more land, so the couple moved in 2017 to the plot that would become Nature\u2019s Bridge Farm.\n\nHis dream was coming true, if only his family could adapt to it. He spent much of the 2000s living in Northern Virginia, sitting in traffic, shuttling to and from his tech job in Arlington. He wanted to do something other than go to work and come home from work, he said.\n\n\u201cI wanted to see life as I hadn\u2019t seen it before. I wanted to understand other people\u2019s experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to see a part of life other people miss out on.\u201d\n\nA new sense of purpose\n\nAt Nature\u2019s Bridge Farm, the yaks are big, hungry, hairy and mysterious. They have names that evoke flowers (\u201cPetunia,\u201d \u201cLotus\u201d) or their personalities (\u201cFeisty,\u201d \u201cLil Furball\u201d). Squint, and they don\u2019t look much different than the cattle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnly as the yaks rush the fence line when Cissell shakes a bucket of treats are their unique features revealed \u2014 wiry coats, curly horns and powerful legs straight out of Tibet. On the Virginia farm\u2019s grassy hills, yaks look like exotic animals imported from a faraway land, which they are.\n\nMackenzie Cissell doesn\u2019t love all of them. She can\u2019t always tell them apart.\n\n\u201cHe has a soft spot in his hearts for the yaks I don\u2019t understand entirely,\u201d she said of her husband. \u201cI guess everyone has their thing and this is his thing.\u201d\n\nWhen the couple first arrived in Buckingham County \u2014 population 17,000 \u2014 it was hard for her to accept the farming life she now celebrates in art. Sometimes, it still is. She misses being able to drive five minutes to the grocery store. She misses sidewalks when it rains and the farm turns into a mudbowl.\n\n\u201cIt was a big transition,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t used to this lifestyle. Something was telling me I wasn\u2019t supposed to be here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere were many of those somethings in the beginning. The family planned to spend a few months in a 300-square-foot RV on the property as they fixed up a homestead likely built in the 1890s. That turned into 15 months \u2014 Cissell working his tech job remotely all day, then replacing windows and rebuilding floors into the night with the help of hired neighbors. Meanwhile, Remy turned up with an E. coli infection, requiring emergency surgery and round-the-clock dialysis.\n\n\u201cAs a mother, that was one of my biggest concerns,\u201d Mackenzie Cissell said. \u201cI almost threw in the towel then and there \u2026 Chances are it was something he got here.\u201d\n\nThen there was the yak attack. Long before Meteor\u2019s escape and subsequent demise, Nature\u2019s Bridge Farm made headlines in 2017, when a mother yak charged Cissell and then-7-year-old Rylan called 911. Cissell said he was trying to corral the animal without realizing it was feeling aggressive. He wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake today, he said, but his wife is still leery of the creatures.\n\n\u201cIf something happens \u2026 I\u2019m out here on this land, with these animals I don\u2019t know how to care for and four kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what I would do if something like that happened today.\u201d\n\nMeteor\u2019s death gave the Cissells a new sense of purpose. Attacked online after the animal became a social media hero, Mackenzie Cissell defended their choices, explaining the philosophy behind their farm and why the expensive animal\u2019s escape wasn\u2019t a victory.\n\nRobert Cissell\u2019s resolve never wavered. Looking out at his property, he talked about how grass-fed husbandry can mitigate global warming. He talked about how small farms rarely face the food recalls of factory farms because they raise animals responsibly. He talked about the possibilities additional acreage would provide, but also the need to use his existing acreage wisely.\n\nSuccess will come, he said, \u201cif we keeping working a little bit at a time.\u201d", "description": "Meteor\u2019s death gave the Cissell family a new sense of purpose.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
