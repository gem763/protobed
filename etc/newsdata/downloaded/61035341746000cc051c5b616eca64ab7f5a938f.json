The call began less than an hour after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced that his company is banning all political ads from its platform, a challenge to Facebook, which has so far stood by its much-criticized decision not to fact check such ads.\n\n\u201cToday is certainly a historical moment of social tension, and I view an important role of our company as defending free expression,\u201d Zuckerberg said. Right now, he added, the debate is about political ads, saying that while he has considered whether to ban such ads from Facebook, \u201con balance so far I\u2019ve thought we should continue.\u201d\n\nThough grappling with big societal issues and regulators breathing down its neck, Facebook continued to grow profit and sales in the double digits during the quarter. Facebook said that it earned $6.09 billion, or $2.12 per share, in the July-September period, up 19% from $5.14 billion, or $1.76 per share, in the same period a year earlier.\n\nRevenue grew 29% to $17.65 billion from $13.73 billion.

It also said that about 2.8 billion people use at least one of its services \u2014 Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram \u2014 at least once a month.\n\n\u201cAdvertisers continue to support Facebook, despite the many controversies swirling around the company, and the user base also continues to expand around the world,\u201d said eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. \u201cYes, Facebook has a lot of challenges it must deal with, but increasing its revenue and user count isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\nThe company based in Menlo Park, California, has had a rough couple of years and is under growing regulatory scrutiny around the world. In the U.S., it faces several government investigations for alleged anti-competitive behavior, including probes by the Federal Trade Commission and 46 state attorneys general.\n\nZuckerberg faced prickly questioning from members of Congress last week when he testified about the company\u2019s plans for a digital cryptocurrency.\n\nInvestors sent Facebook\u2019s stock up 4% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Facebook reported solid third-quarter results Wednesday showing steady growth in its user base even as it faces broad regulatory", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/30/7714b0_earns-facebook-29488-in-tuesday-oct-29-2019-photo-facebook-app-is-shown-on-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
