And then after that, we've got the best pitcher in the world going, too. And then after that, we've got the best pitcher in the world going, too,\" Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"\n\nBregman and fellow MVP candidate Anthony Rendon certainly did their parts to make this the Year of the Home Run. And Jose Altuve lit up Minute Maid Park with his walk-off homer to beat the Yankees in the American League Championship Series.\n\nWATCH | Altuve belts series-winning, walk-off home run in 9th:\n\nJose Altuve belted a series-winning, walk-off home run in the 9th inning to give the Houston Astros a 6-4 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 6 of the ALCS. 2:13\n\nBut the focus of this Fall Classic is right on the rotations. Houston opened as a 2-1 favourite at the Las Vegas sportsbooks.\n\nCole is set to throw the first pitch on Tuesday in Houston at 8:08 p.m. ET. He led the majors with 326 strikeouts, was second to Verlander in the big leagues with 20 wins and topped the AL with a 2.50 earned-run average.\n\n'I'm excited to get in there'\n\nHe also is 19-0 in his last 25 starts. That includes 3-0 in the playoffs so far, allowing one earned run in 22 2/3 innings while fanning 32.\n\nCole was acquired by the Astros a few months after they won the 2017 World Series. He has fit in fine with his Houston teammates and also has got acquainted with some of the Washington aces \u2014 the teams share the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches spring training complex in Florida.\n\n\"I know a few guys in their rotation, and I'm personally excited that they're in this position, and I'm just very excited to get in there,\" Cole said late Saturday night.\n\n\"They've worked their tails off. I know a lot of the guys on the team, and I know how they prepare,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to the challenge.\"\n\nLike when he faces Washington's big bopper.\n\n\"Anthony Rendon is one of the greatest hitters in the game right now,\" Cole said. \"There's no real way to get him out. You just kind of hope that he misses some balls or he scorches them right at your guys, I guess.\n\n\"I've been watching him since I was in college. It's very unique what he's been able to do and he's just a pleasure to watch play.\"\n\nThe World Series comes through Houston. ... I think it should be that way for many years to come. \u2014 Astros 3rd baseman Alex Bregman\n\nThe clubs saw each other back in February when they played in the exhibition opener, and Scherzer gave up a homer to the first batter of the game.\n\nNow, eight months later, they meet for real. The 107-win Astros trying to capture their second crown in three years versus the wild-card Nationals making their Series debut.\n\n\"The World Series comes through Houston. I like the sound of that. I think it should be that way for many years to come,\" Bregman said.\n\nNo slight to Bregman and other big hitters here: Altuve, the ALCS MVP, post-season star George Springer and top shortstops Trea Turner and Carlos Correa. And not to overlook the young stars on this stage for the first time, rookies like Juan Soto and Yordan Alvarez.\n\nYet in an era when teams search for new pitching strategies -- witness the Astros' parade of relievers in Game 6 of the ALCS \u2013 the two clubs left figure to rely heavily on their starters.\n\nFine by Houston manager AJ Hinch.\n\n\"Philosophically, whether it's about the new-age opener or pulling guys third time through, most of the people that support that haven't had Verlander or Cole on their team,\" he said.\n\nHalting 103-win Yankees\n\nThe Nationals stack up just fine, too. Consider their staff includes Anibal Sanchez, who took a playoff no-hit bid into the eighth inning.\n\nThe Astros, who began as the National League expansion Colt .45s in 1962, led the majors in setting a franchise record for wins.\n\nTheir playoff path was more of a struggle, beating wild-card Tampa Bay in the deciding Game 5 of the AL Division Series and then stopping the 103-win Yankees on Altuve's pennant-winning homer off Aroldis Chapman in the ninth inning.\n\nThe Nationals, who started out as the Montreal Expos in 1969, took the reverse route.\n\nA season after letting slugger Bryce Harper leave as a free agent, the Nats were just 19-31 in May. The slow start prompted speculation that manager Dave Martinez would be fired and management would sell off stars at the trade deadline.[\n\nInstead, the Nationals bounced back. They earned a playoff spot, eliminated the favoured Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Division Series and swept the surging St. Louis Cardinals behind NLCS MVP Howie Kendrick.\n\nWATCH | Massive 1st inning helps Nationals sweep Cardinals:\n\nWashington scored seven runs in the first inning on its way to beating St. Louis 7-4. 1:24\n\nFor Washington, the city gets its first World Series since the Senators played in 1933. For the Nationals, the old October question: rest or rust?\n\nThe Nationals will have a full week between games while the Astros get only two days off. A fact on this: Boston had two more days of rest last year and beat the Dodgers. But before that, the past nine champions were the clubs that had less rest.\n\nMartinez isn't worried.\n\n\"These guys have played unbelievably. I think they needed a break. Some guys really needed a break,\" he said. \"Heal their bodies a little bit.\"", "description": "Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke vs. Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin - all of them all-star starters, still pitching at their peak.
