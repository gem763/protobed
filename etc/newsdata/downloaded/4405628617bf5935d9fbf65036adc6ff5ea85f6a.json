The parties held a meeting on Thursday afternoon to discuss their objections and grievances.\n\n\n\nAfter the meeting adjourned, they sang \"the IEC is taking (us) for granted\" in Zulu. They then held an impromptu media briefing announcing they intended taking the IEC to the Electoral Court.

African Transformation Movement's Mzwanele Manyi said the so-called smaller parties were also calling for a re-run of the elections. \"We are not convinced that the trajectory that we are on is the trajectory that is going to deliver a free and fair elections. There are a number of issues that have been raised by all of us. All these issues have indeed been put to the attention of the IEC. For us it is a crucial issue ... that the ink is a fundamental issue that is undermining the credibility of these elections.\n\n\"We are saying with all these double votes that have come to pass, the credibility of these elections is at stake.\" The parties which have also taken offence to being referred by the media as \"smaller parties\" complained about poor coverage on Wednesday's election day.\n\nThey said the media \"de-campaigned\" them and accused media outlets, \"like the SABC\", of only focusing on the big three parties: the ANC, DA and EFF. This ensured that their ability to communicate their message to South Africans was limited, they said. Meanwhile, at least 20 people have been arrested in KwaZulu-Natal in connection with double voting. The IEC said it was running a sample audit to determine how widespread the situation had been on voting day. Several objections were laid with the IEC over voter irregularities.\n\nFind everything you need to know about the 2019 National and Provincial Government Elections at our News24 Elections site, including the latest news and detailed, interactive maps for how South Africa has voted over the past 3 elections.
