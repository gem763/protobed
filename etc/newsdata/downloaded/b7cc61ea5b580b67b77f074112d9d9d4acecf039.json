We go behind the scenes at Gossamer, a celebration of hosiery\n\nAn art exhibition about tights? In Margate? It sounds very end-of-the-pier, all saucy postcards and mother-in-law jokes. There is something a bit icky about hosiery in the day-to-day. Tights are underwear, sure, but they\u2019re more business end than babe-wear: functional, grubby, prone to tugs and bald patches. There are few words uglier in the English language than \u201cgusset\u201d.\n\n\u201cTights sit in the innermost, intimate regions of the female form,\u201d says Zoe Bedeaux, curator of Gossamer, at Margate\u2019s Carl Freedman Gallery. \u201cSo when one thinks about their function and then imagines them in the context of art, I guess they can conjure an element of humour.\u201d\n\nWhile Gossamer is a witty, knowing exhibition, it approaches hosiery with barely a smirk, for tights and stockings have actually been used by an astonishing range of artists, from Man Ray and Louise Bourgeois to Sarah Lucas and Senga Nengudi. Nylons do, after all, work brilliantly in sculpture \u2013 stretching, masking, distending and accommodating almost anything stuffed into them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Erotic fantasies \u2026 Leigh Bowery photographed by Fergus Greer in 1994.

Bedeaux found herself conducting a roll-call of artworks she had encountered using tights and stockings: it went on and on. Carrying associations with femininity, fetishism, domesticity, dominance, smut, suburbia, sexual freedom, \u201cstandard\u201d skin colours and body types, hosiery offers a rich seam for exploration.\n\nBefore his 12-year partnership with Marina Abramovi\u0107, performance artist Ulay produced a series of works exploring gender, among them S/He and Death of a Transvestite, which show him in glamorous makeup, dressed in nightclub and bridal costume and stockings.\n\nUlay was less interested in the erotic, sexual connotations of feminine dress than in a personal exploration of gender. \u201cI had an incredibly beautiful \u2013 actually female-beautiful \u2013 body.\n\n\u201cAll the stockings, everything, suited me,\u201d says the artist who was keen to see how the feminine aspect of himself coexisted with the masculine. \u201cI wanted to explore the in-between. I wanted to make clear that my queerness is not an inborn thing: it\u2019s not a social, not an economical, not a cultural thing. It\u2019s just a sympathy for the other \u2013 and of course I always wanted to be part of the other.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fleshy serpents \u2026 Sheela Na Gig by Sarah Lucas (2012).

His images of stark fishnet patterning taut across pale flesh are so up-close that the curving contours of the human body feel architectural in scale. Moriyama is a photographer of the street rather than the studio, his beat being Tokyo\u2019s underbelly. His artfully arranged landscapes of the human body encased in mesh seem to blend the abstract patterns of the built environment with the erotics of Moriyama\u2019s predatory gaze.\n\nPolly Borland\u2019s photo series Bunny is simultaneously sexy and strange. Borland started working on Bunny in 2002 with a then unknown young actress called Gwendoline Christie. Excited by Christie\u2019s striking looks, Borland first planned to shoot her as a kind of Bunny Girl pinup, but thanks to the uncanny, mutating effects of stretchy hosiery, the project got odder and more animalistic. Christie became beast-like, her body by turns male, female and monster. Borland has continued to experiment with hosiery, covering and moulding the body in her more sculptural series Smudge and Morph.\n\n\u201cWith Bunny and then Smudge, the idea was to use stockings to conceal the human face and make dolls out of people,\u201d says Borland. \u201cMy favourite books as a child were the Lonely Doll series. Edith the doll character had a felt face with painted eyes. I also had a doll with a painted stocking face. With the Bunny series, the work partially became about the different identities or cliches that are used to describe or in some cases define women.\u201d The combination of naked flesh and the clingy veil of gossamer hosiery brings an unnerving sensuality to Borland\u2019s work. \u201cFetish doesn\u2019t interest me,\u201d she says however.\n\nLeigh Bowery, by contrast, constructed fantastical costumes that manipulated his body to disturbing, erotic effect. Photographer Fergus Greer, who made detailed portraits of the performance artist\u2019s highly textured looks, says: \u201cLeigh\u2019s use of hosiery, whether fetishistically or just to delineate form, gave a sexual, metaphoric language to his work.\u201d Hosiery gave him \u201can open landscape of creative space for erotic fantasies to play in\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Upsetting boundaries\u2019 \u2026 Senga Nengudi\u2019s Performance Piece (1978). Photograph: Senga Nengudi, Courtesy of the artist and Spr\u00fcth Magers\n\nThe overlap between the sculptural potential of hosiery and its sexual associations is further explored in works by Louise Bourgeois and Sarah Lucas. Bourgeois used tights to form mutant bodies: stuffed as sausage-like limbs, stretched over metal frameworks to resemble female torsos, or strange, expressive, semi-human creatures.\n\nIn her ongoing Bunny series, Lucas built on Bourgeois\u2019s mutant female stocking sculptures, using three pairs of stuffed tights stretched over a chair to suggest the body of a drunk (literally legless) woman whose supposedly sexy attire \u2013 stockings and bunny ears \u2013 look tawdry in the morning-after light of a gallery. Lucas\u2019s Bunnys are female bodies reduced to a few sexual signifiers: all stockings and stilettos. In her NUDS sculptures, stuffed tights stand in for human limbs of unspecified gender, twisting like fleshy serpents in a strangling, sensual embrace.\n\nAs the title NUDS suggests, much of the sculptural impact of tights comes from their resemblance to human skin, and the body-like forms they offer. That of course depends on whose skin and whose body: until shockingly recently, the term \u201cnude\u201d in fashion indicated only a beige-pink colour.\n\nAs brands making nude tights for women of colour (Sheer Chemistry, Bianca Miller, Nubian Skin) appeared on the British market, Enam Gbewonyo started \u201cto chart the history of hosiery and its relationship with black women. I thought about how this item of clothing had till then marginalised black women and how we are often made to feel invisible in the fashion and beauty markets.\u201d\n\nHer exploration led back to the days of slavery and empire, to the tights worn by black nurses on the NHS, and the pink tights and shoes that black dancers were forced to wear as a ballet \u201cnorm\u201d. Throughout the history of hosiery advertising, she sees the \u201ceroticisation of white women and subjugation of black women\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Unnerving sensuality \u2026 detail from Morph 7 by Polly Borland (2018). Photograph: \u00a9 Courtesy of the artist and Murray White Room, Melbourne\n\nGbewonyo has been working with hosiery since 2016. \u201cI was both interested in it as a material in its malleability and how I could manipulate it in so many interesting ways,\u201d she says. \u201cI cut tights up, stitch them into yarn and create hand-knitted and woven works. I also stitch the legs together to make ruffled fabric that is stretched over canvas. I burn into them, embroider by hand on them and trap them in tissue paper. There\u2019s practically no limit to how they can be used.\u201d\n\nIn Gossamer, Gbewonyo will show alongside Senga Nengudi, her hero. Nengudi started making sculpture with nylon tights in the mid-1970s, works she referred to as \u201cabstracted reflections of used bodies\u201d.\n\nGbewonyo says: \u201cWhat I love most about Nengudi\u2019s work is how she upsets the boundaries of traditional museum culture by inviting the public to cross those barriers, to touch and feel and truly connect with her work. For me, her work is about celebrating the female form. Hosiery [\u2026] changes shape just as the female form changes shape through different seasons of our life.\u201d\n\nBedeaux agrees: \u201cTights are highly transformative, loaded with all sorts of socio-political connotations. The show is complex, it\u2019s not a show about tights per se: it\u2019s about the possibilities that can come from using a particular object outside of its utilitarian function. This show explores the alchemy of hosiery.\u201d", "description": "From Man Ray to Louise Bourgeois, an astonishing range of artists have used tights and stockings to turbocharge their work.
