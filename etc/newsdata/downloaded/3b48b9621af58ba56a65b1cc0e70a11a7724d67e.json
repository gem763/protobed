The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $2.2 billion also represents a year-over-year fall of 0.3%.\n\n\n\nThe company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions, of late. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings moved 3.7% south to 78 cents over the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nA Sneak Peak into Q2 Performance\n\n\n\nIn the last reported quarter, AGCO\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. However, the top-line figure missed the consensus mark and declined year on year. Notably, AGCO outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 33.8%.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\n\n\nFactors to Consider\n\n\n\nBenefits from cost-reduction initiatives and positive impact of pricing are expected to have bolstered AGCO\u2019s gross and operating margins during July-September quarter. AGCO is consistently making strategic investments to enhance and expand its product lines, upgrade system capabilities as well as improve factory productivity. These factors are likely to have contributed to its third-quarter results.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the North America segment\u2019s sales is pinned at $552 million for the quarter, calling for year-over-year growth of 1.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment\u2019s operating income is $17.44 million, indicating a slump of 47.2% from the year-ago quarter. The segment\u2019s margin in the quarter is likely to reflect higher expenses associated with product launches, weaker product mix and lower production due to reduced market outlook. Additionally, late planting and slow crop development as well as ongoing trade concerns are likely to have impacted the segment\u2019s results in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the South America segment\u2019s third-quarter sales is $254 million, suggesting a decline of 9.6% from the prior-year quarter's $281 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment\u2019s operating income is pegged at $7.10 million, indicating a plunge of 45.3% from the year-ago quarter. Further, reduced market outlook for the segment are expected to have thwarted margins in the July-September quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the EME (Europe/Middle East) segment\u2019s quarterly sales is pinned at $1,107 million, projecting a year-on-year drop of 5%. The segment\u2019s operating income is expected to be up 12% year on year to $122 million.\n\n\n\nFor the Asia/Pacific segment revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $227 million, indicating an improvement of 1.3% from the year-ago reported quarter. The segment\u2019s operating income is anticipated to have edged down to $17.90 million from prior-year quarter\u2019s $18 million.\n\nAGCO Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAGCO Corporation Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nAGCO Corporation price-eps-surprise | AGCO Corporation Quote\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\n\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t conclusively predict an earnings beat for AGCO this season.
