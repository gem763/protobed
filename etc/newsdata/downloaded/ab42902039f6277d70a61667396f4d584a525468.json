REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\n\nThomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest travel firm, collapsed last month after it failed to finalise a restructuring plan, stranding over a hundred thousand passengers.\n\nPeter Fankhauser apologised again to customers, staff and suppliers as he appeared before a British parliamentary committee, and said that responsibility for the collapse was shared among several parties who tried, and failed, to agree the rescue deal.\n\nAsked about his salary, which totalled 1.02 million pounds ($1.29 million) in 2018 including pension and benefits, Fankhauser said he did not set his own pay or decide any bonus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to try and defend my base pay, because in relation to a normal worker\u2019s base salary, this is an enormous amount... I fully understand the sentiment in the public,\u201d he told the committee.\n\n\u201cHowever, what I can say to that is that I worked tirelessly for the success of this company and I\u2019m deeply sorry that I was not able to secure the deal.\u201d\n\nFankhauser said his efforts to transform the company after his appointment in 2014 had been constrained by its debts.\n\nHe said that a 750,000 pound ($947,475) bonus he was paid in 2017 could theoretically be clawed back, but 30% was paid in shares which were now worthless.\n\n\u201cMy commitment to the company was shown: I never sold one share, because I was believing in the company,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would take some time to reflect on what was the right thing to do with his pay after business committee chair Rachel Reeves said that it could be put to better use if it funded redundancy packages for his colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe number of times you\u2019ve said \u201csorry\u201d - it just rings rather hollow when you\u2019re not willing to put something back,\u201d she said.\n\nFOUGHT SO HARD\n\nThe firm collapsed after it became unable to service its debts and failed to convince banks to back a rescue plan in the face of changing customer habits and intense competition from low-cost airlines and internet companies.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s management said a deal was possible until the final hours before the company failed, and that banks and shareholder Fosun would have backed a deal to save the company if there had been government support.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s German airline Condor is still operating with support of a loan from the German government, while its Nordic business may still be bought. Its UK business went straight into liquidation, with its UK shops bought by a rival last week.\n\nFankhauser said he would not criticise the UK government for its decision not to provide support but that the cost of Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse was \u201cfar higher\u201d than what the firm requested, adding that he had not spoken to any government ministers in the week before the collapse.\n\nBritain\u2019s transport and business ministries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPreviously Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that government support for Thomas Cook would have just delayed the inevitable, but Fankhauser said it would have allowed management to overhaul the business.\n\n\u201cThe recapitalisation plan, once successfully completed, would have put us in the position that we most probably would have been the best funded travel company in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Former Thomas Cook cabin crew members protest outside the venue for the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, Britain, September 30, 2019. REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that after the successful recapitalisation, we would have had a new start. Otherwise I would have not fought so hard for it.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.7895 pounds)\n\n($1 = 0.7916 pounds)", "description": "The former chief executive of bankrupt travel firm Thomas Cook said on Tuesday he understood public anger over his pay but defended his record, saying he had worked tirelessly to try to save the company.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441076929&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0WD", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
