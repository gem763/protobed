You're not quite sick, but you know, you're not quite up to it. I think this is how the markets or investors gonna feel as they get into 2020,\" he said.\n\nHui said the chances of a global recession next year \u2014 typically defined as \"much weaker growth\" than 2.5% to 3% global growth \u2014 was between 33% and 40%.\n\n\"If you think about what traditionally cause(s) a recession, whether it's a tightening of credit condition or a significant spike in yields, some of these conditions are not there yet,\" he said.", "description": "\"I think the overall environment is going to be very, very challenging to corporate sentiment,\" says J.P.
