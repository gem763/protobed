They got Jeff Daniels, known for lecturing sanctimoniously about politics as Will McAvoy on \u201cThe Newsroom,\u201d for the part of Comey. \u201cThe Comey role is kind of on the nose for Daniels, who already won an Emmy playing a Republican who\u2019s not a Republican prone to noxious bromides about the American way,\u201d notes David Rutz. They may have been stuck with Daniels for sheer physical reasons, actually. Not only does he bear a vague resemblance to Comey (good enough for TV miniseries work), at 6\u20193 he\u2019s within spitting distance of Comey\u2019s Lurch-y 6\u20198 frame. The elevated walkways laid down on set for Daniels to trod won\u2019t need to be quite as elevated as for most other actors.\n\nThe miniseries is based on Comey\u2019s own book and the screenwriter spent time with the man himself, so, yes, this will very much be a \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington\u201d treatment of the main character.\n\nHe should have insisted on playing himself as a condition of selling the book rights. There needs to be a campy element somewhere in this production to offset the preachiness, like adding a little spice to a sweet dish to cut through the treacle. I\u2019d tune in to watch Jim Comey as Jim Comey, lecturing Trump in the White House dining room on America\u2019s civic heritage. I\u2019m not tuning in for this:\n\nThe book shares Comey\u2019s never-before-told experiences from some of the highest-stakes situations of his career in the past two decades of American government, exploring what good, ethical leadership looks like, and how it drives sound decisions. His journey provides an unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in what makes an effective leader. From prosecuting the Mafia and Martha Stewart to helping change the Bush administration\u2019s policies on torture and electronic surveillance, overseeing the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation as well as ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Comey has been involved in some of the most consequential cases and policies of recent history. Ray researched the project for over a year in order to make the drama a fair, responsible and comprehensively documented account of real-life events. He traveled to Washington, D.C. and several other cities to meet with Comey, his family, and many other key players, including prominent journalists, FBI agents, government officials from both political parties and others.\n\nNo one wants a full career retrospective here. If you\u2019re watching this, you\u2019re watching for two scenes: The Trump/Comey White House \u201cloyalty\u201d conversation, obviously, and the scene the week before the election when our hero decides that duty requires him to upend the entire campaign by reopening the Clinton Emailgate probe.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing. Both of those scenes would be much more enjoyable played as comedy rather than the self-serious dramatic treatment they\u2019re destined to receive. The entire Comey story from 2016 through his firing in 2017 is made for comedy, really. A pompous but well-meaning lawman bumbles his way through one absurd episode after another in the middle of a national election, with escalating consequences for the future of the free world, while encountering a bevy of absurd characters \u2014 Hillary, Strzok and Page, McCabe, the entire Russiagate Mos Eisley cast of characters, and of course Trump himself. It\u2019s a political version of a \u201cMr. Bean\u201d episode. Make it an over-the-top satire of history, like \u201cDick\u201d or \u201cThe Death of Stalin,\u201d mining the audience\u2019s familiarity with the material for laughs. I\u2019d pay good money to watch, say, Will Ferrell as James Comey puzzling over what to do with his conclusion that Hillary is sort of guilty of mishandling classified information but also sort of not. Imagine the Ferrell-ized version of the famous Comey press conference.\n\nImagine the Trump/Comey \u201cloyalty\u201d chat played by Ferrell and, for instance, Anthony Atamanuik.\n\nThe man who\u2019s playing Trump instead is Irish actor Brendan Gleeson, who does resemble you-know-who in broad terms but will need some vocal training, as you\u2019ll see from this 2017 clip. Exit question: What if the forthcoming IG report and Durham investigation end up accusing Comey of misconduct in the Russiagate probe? Does the miniseries get scrapped or do they do some kind of \u201cantihero\u201d thing with it? Jim Comey as the Joker would be good too.", "description": "Hoo boy.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
