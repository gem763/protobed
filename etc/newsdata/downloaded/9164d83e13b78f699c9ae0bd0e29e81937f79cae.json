EIA/S\n\nU.S. crude oil stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI, have risen by about 1.5 million barrels in the week through Oct. 25, traders said earlier, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute releases industry data later on Tuesday, while the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration releases inventory data on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump said earlier on Monday he expected to sign a significant part of the trade deal with China ahead of schedule but did not elaborate on the timing.\n\nLeaders of the world's two biggest economies are working to agree on the text for a \"Phase 1\" trade agreement announced by Trump on Oct. 11. Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal with China's President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.\n\nThe trade war has hit economic growth around the world and kept oil prices range-bound for months.\n\nGRAPHIC: U.S. crude inventories, weekly changes since 2017\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2XlX17b\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "UPDATE 1-Oil prices edge lower ahead of U.S. stockpile numbers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPED910E7-ORUBS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
