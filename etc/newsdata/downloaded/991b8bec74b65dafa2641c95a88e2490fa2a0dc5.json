He called her a \u2018third-rate politician,'\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"This was not a dialogue, it was sort of a diatribe.\"\n\nPelosi said Trump was \u201cshaken up\u201d by having lost most Republicans in a Wednesday vote condemning Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria,\n\n\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,\" Pelosi said.\n\nHours later, Trump tweeted that it was Pelosi who had an \"unhinged meltdown.\"\n\nThe White House meeting came soon after the House overwhelmingly passed bipartisan resolution condemning Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, all but clearing the way for Turkey to invade territory held by the U.S.-allied Kurds.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (C), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) (R) and Representative Steny Hoyer, walk out of the White House after meeting with US President Donald Trump on October 16, 2019. More\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called Pelosi's decision to walk out \"baffling, but not surprising.\"\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues,\" Grisham said in a statement. \"While Democratic leadership chose to storm out and get in front of the cameras to whine, everyone else in the meeting chose to stay in the room and work on behalf of this country.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said Pelosi left after Trump called her a third-rate politician, but not before Pelosi said she responded: \"I wish you were a politician, Mr. President. Then you would know the art of the possible.\"\n\n'The Kurds are being slaughtered': House votes to condemn President Trump\u2019s troop pullout from Syria\n\nSchumer said some lawmakers from both parties stayed behind, as he did initially, because he wanted to ask a question.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the meeting, which included top Pentagon officials, was \u201cvery productive\u201d with \u201cthe Democrats who actually stayed in the meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who would stay in the room are those who care the most for the process of solving this problem and making sure America is safe,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nDemocrats are also complaining that the administration has cancelled a briefing for lawmakers on Syria that had been scheduled for Thursday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Nancy Pelosi: Donald Trump had a 'meltdown' during meeting on Syria", "description": "Congressional Democrats walked out of a White House meeting on Syria, claiming Donald Trump had a 'meltdown' and called Nancy Pelosi 'third rate.'", "authors": ["Maureen Groppe", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uen55c917SqIUL6rGbkiww--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/324ae944abaed0df44135e0d0c441716", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
