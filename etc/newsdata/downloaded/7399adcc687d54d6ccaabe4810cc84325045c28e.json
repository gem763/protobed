(AP) - First-year California coach Mark Fox tells his team time and again about the importance of investing and attacking.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our motto as a team,\u201d senior point guard Paris Austin said. \u201cSo every day we\u2019re putting in that extra work before practice and after practice, and just being ready to go.\u201d\n\nCal can\u2019t fall much further as the Golden Bears try to bounce back from the worst two-year stretch in school history: Back-to-back eight-win seasons and a 16-47 record.\n\nThe university hired Fox to replace the fired Wyking Jones, whose team endured a 15-game losing streak last season before winning three of its final four regular-season Pac-12 contests.\n\nFox had a 286-176 record in 14 seasons as coach at Nevada and Georgia. He made the NCAA Tournament five times but never advanced to the Sweet 16. Fox was fired at Georgia last year after failing to reach the tournament in each of his final three seasons with the Bulldogs.\n\nHe hired longtime college head coach Trent Johnson as a special assistant on his staff to lead player development efforts and considers him a valuable addition with his knowledge of the Pac-12.\n\nEven Fox realizes it\u2019s fair Cal was picked at the bottom.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to change it from day one, and hopefully we can prove everybody wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nTHE FOX WAY\n\nEverything is new for his players, and Fox knows this transition will take time as Cal tries to return to respectability.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s about making a daily investment to get better, and to this point, which is still very, very early in the season and obviously in my tenure, I\u2019ve been pleased with the investment that these kids are making,\u201d Fox said.\n\nFox refers to a monthly roadmap to chart his group\u2019s progress then take the next step forward.\n\nHis approach has resonated with players.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really met a man like him to be honest, especially from a coaching standpoint,\u201d sophomore guard Matt Bradley said. \u201cHis No. 1 thing is the team . he puts the team in front of everything, and he expects the same from us. He\u2019s a players\u2019 coach, a really good guy.\u201d\n\nUPHILL CLIMB\n\nThe Bears have been picked to finish last in the conference by media who cover the league.\n\nThey hope to prove some people wrong and pull off surprising results along the way despite the challenges of recent years.\n\n\u201cI think our motivation comes from within each individual. Being underdogs, we all have something we want to prove, we all want to show that we\u2019ve been working hard just like other teams,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe want to show that it\u2019s going to pay off.\u201d\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nAustin is the Bears\u2019 top returning scorer having averaged 11.6 points while also dishing out 4.3 assists.\n\nHe knows he is the veteran on the team, feeling a little like the old guy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to being a better leader on the floor, making better decisions,\u201d Austin said.\n\nBRADLEY\u2019S OVERHAUL\n\nBradley has trimmed 10 pounds from his 6-foot-4 frame and he is counting on his improved fitness contributing to stronger defense and more production on the offensive end.\n\nHe established a Cal freshman record by shooting 47.2% from 3-point range, (50-for-106).\n\nNow in his second year, the adjustments should be fewer. Bradley wants to step in and take a charge when needed, make the hustle play, even speak up if his teammates need him to be vocal.\n\n\u201cAs a freshman, I was just learning,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not saying I have all the answers now, but I definitely know a lot more. I\u2019m really excited for this upcoming season because a lot of the stuff I do now is going to be based on experience.\u201d\n\nBOOSTING THE NUMBERS\n\nGetting back to basics - a focus on fundamentals - will be important for the Bears.\n\nFor Fox, that means 17 new players learning a system.\n\nCal managed only 23.8 field goals per game, averaging 68.4 points and got outrebounded 36.1 to 29.1.\n\nThe Bears shot 42.6% and managed just 10.9 assists.\n\n\u201cWhat we tried to do was spend the summer workouts installing our defense and getting that terminology as in place as we could, so when official practice started we were only working on the other half of the terminology and on our offense, and so that has made it a little bit smoother,\u201d Fox said. \u201cBut when you have 17 new players - and new coaches - we\u2019ve got to be very detailed in our plans, so everyone can be on the same page.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "First-year California coach Mark Fox tells his team time and again about the importance of investing and attacking.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/pac-12_media_day_basketball_67712_c0-216-5184-3240_s1200x700.jpg?48c42b2789ee0d08ce9a91ab8317603cc81a12f8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
