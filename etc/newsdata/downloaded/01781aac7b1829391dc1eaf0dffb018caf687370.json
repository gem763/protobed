Concurrently, John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, said he \u201cfelt bad\u201d for having left Trump\u2019s side, because his advice was not followed and the president therefore faced impeachment.\n\nMitt Romney: Trump's best staff decision was 'not choosing me' Read more\n\nSpeaking at the Sea Island Summit, an event in Georgia organised by the conservative Washington Examiner, Kelly said that on leaving, he \u201csaid, \u2018Whatever you do, don\u2019t hire a \u2018yes man\u2019, someone who won\u2019t tell you the truth\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d the retired marine general said he told Trump. \u201cBecause if you do, I believe you will be impeached.\u201d\n\nKelly, 69, left his post in December last year, to criticism that he had not managed to restrain Trump\u2019s wilder impulses.\n\nThe former South Carolina congressman Mick Mulvaney replaced Kelly and still fills role in an acting capacity. He is under pressure, having told reporters Trump did make Ukraine the subject of a quid pro quo, withholding nearly $400m in US military aid while asking for political favours, the issue at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump denies having done so but the House foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight committees have heard extensive testimony to the contrary.\n\nOn Saturday Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, met the committees behind closed doors at the Capitol. The Trump administration directed him not to testify, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters, but Reeker appeared after receiving a subpoena.\n\nThe top US diplomat for Europe told the committees he had not known US aid may have been withheld in order to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new president to conduct investigations helpful to Trump, a source told Reuters. The source said Reeker was prepared to say he had largely left Ukraine policy to Kurt Volker, then US special representative for Ukraine negotiations, and others.\n\nReeker took up his post on 18 March, overseeing 50 nations including Russia and Ukraine at a time when the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, faced public criticism at home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Philip Reeker arrives to testify in impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, in Washington. Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters\n\nThe source told Reuters Reeker sought a stronger state department defence of Yovanovitch, who was brought back early in May, but this appeared to have been stymied \u201cfrom the top\u201d. It was not clear if secretary of state Mike Pompeo objected.\n\nOther officials have said the Ukraine issue was delegated to Volker and Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union. Volker testified and released text messages that detailed conversations between him, Sondland and Bill Taylor, now the top US diplomat in Ukraine. Taylor wrote that he thought it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold aid for help with a political campaign.\n\nTaylor testified that he was told the aid would be withheld until Ukraine conducted the investigations Trump requested. Sondland and Taylor have testified and detailed their concerns about the influence of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nAnother diplomat, George Kent, testified that he was told to \u201clie low\u201d and defer to three political appointees. Yovanovitch has accused the Trump administration of recalling her based on false claims.\n\nThe House committees have scheduled several depositions for next week, all behind closed doors. On Monday, former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman is due to testify. On Tuesday, lawmakers expect Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s top expert on Ukraine.\n\nKathryn Wheelbarger, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security, is scheduled for Wednesday and Tim Morrison, a White House adviser on Russia and Europe, is set to appear on Thursday.\n\nOn Friday this week, Kupperman received a subpoena. He asked a federal court if he should comply or follow Trump\u2019s directive not to, because he \u201ccannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches\u201d. Without the court\u2019s help, he said, he would have to make a decision that could \u201cinflict grave constitutional injury\u201d on Congress or the presidency.\n\nUnless the judge issues an opinion by Monday, his testimony might not occur as scheduled.\n\nAlso on Friday, a federal judge rejected a claim by Trump and his Republican allies that the impeachment process was illegitimate because the full House had not voted to authorize it. The judge ordered the administration to give the judiciary committee secret material from the former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election.\n\n\u201cThe American people had another victory yesterday in the court decision validating not only the impeachment inquiry but the imperative that the administration stop stonewalling,\u201d House intelligence chair Adam Schiff, leading the inquiry, told Reuters.\n\nDoug Collins, the top Republican on the judiciary committee, said he looked forward to \u201can expeditious appeal\u201d.\n\nTrump lashes out at Kamala Harris after senator protests criminal justice award Read more\n\nIn Georgia on Saturday, Kelly insisted he had \u201can awful lot of, to say the least, second thoughts about leaving\u201d the White House.\n\n\u201cIt pains me to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I believe if I was still there or someone like me was there, [Trump] would not be kind of, all over the place.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is expected to lead to a House vote before Christmas, most likely sending Trump to the Senate for trial. A conviction is unlikely but the White House and Republicans have faced criticism for their response so far, chaotic and confrontational rather than coordinated and effective.\n\n\u201cSomeone has got to be a guide that tells [the president] that you either have the authority or you don\u2019t, or \u2018Mr President, don\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d Kelly said. \u201cDon\u2019t hire someone that will just nod and say, \u2018That\u2019s a great idea Mr President.\u2019 Because you will be impeached.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe system that should be in place, clearly \u2013 the system of advising, bringing in experts in, having these discussions with the president so he can make an informed decision, that clearly is not in place. And I feel bad that I left.\u201d\n\nFrom Camp David, Trump tweeted that he\u2019s \u201cnot concerned with the impeachment scam \u2026 because I did nothing wrong.\u201d", "description": "Remarks came as testimony resumed in the impeachment inquiry against Trump, which the president has called a \u2018scam\u2019", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e2e8333a47c13ebc3e276a7ef4ed2a62e24422f/0_206_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b7ec6f0266abaa494b0058ddd46993a", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
