She also alleges that she was paid less than her male colleagues and was given \"female duties like housework.\"\n\n\"Robert De Niro is someone who has clung to old mores,\" Robinson's complaint states. \"He does not accept the idea that men should treat women as equals. He does not care that gender discrimination in the workplace violates the law. Ms. Robinson is a casualty of this attitude.\"\n\n\"The allegations made by Graham Chase Robinson against Robert De Niro are beyond absurd,\" Tom Harvey, De Niro's attorney, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nRobinson, who was first hired as an assistant to De Niro in 2008 and was promoted to Vice President of Production & Finance, was sued by De Niro's company in August for breach of fiduciary responsibilities. The company claims Robinson binge-watched 55 episodes of \"Friends\" on the job and ran up massive bills for personal use on a corporate American Express card.\n\nRead More", "description": "Robert De Niro is being accused of gender discrimination by a female ex-employee, who has filed a $12 million countersuit against the actor.", "authors": ["Marianne Garvey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181025120409-02-robert-de-niro-file-2018-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
