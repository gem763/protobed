(John Locher/AP)\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 The raucous crowd at Mandalay Bay Events Center was treated to one of sports\u2019 true joys Tuesday night: an old-fashioned duel between perhaps the WNBA\u2019s most expressive and least expressive superstars.\n\nIn one corner, Liz Cambage. The Las Vegas Aces\u2019 6-foot-8 center towers over, and bulldozes through, her opponents. She commands defensive attention, and the viewer\u2019s attention, like a magnet. Cambage recently posed nude for ESPN the Magazine, then arrived to Game 4 of the WNBA semifinals Tuesday wearing a T-shirt bearing one of the images from the photo shoot.\n\nIn the other, Elena Delle Donne. The Washington Mystics\u2019 MVP forward glides across the court with economical motions, turning time and again to well-honed moves that allow her to create openings that often seem to measure a fraction of an inch. She has seemed to wear two masks: a clear Velcro model to protect her broken nose, and a blank visage that keeps observers from reading her inner monologue.\n\nOne approach is not necessarily superior to the other, but the quiet way prevailed Tuesday.\n\nThe Mystics defeated the Aces, 94-90, to advance to the WNBA Finals for the second straight season. Delle Donne and Cambage each scored 25 points to lead their teams as the all-stars went back and forth in front of Los Angeles Lakers stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis, who took in the tense contest from courtside seats.\n\nSin City knows a thing or two about hyping heavyweight fights, and this series\u2019 headliners played their roles, perhaps unintentionally, at Monday\u2019s practice.\n\nHere was Cambage, relaxing in a chair at practice, explaining why her physical style and demonstrative personality have made her a lightning rod for opponents. \u201cI\u2019m a cheeky little s---,\u201d she joked with a mischievous smile and her Australian accent.\n\n['Playoff Emma is having some fun' Meesseman steps up]\n\nThere was Delle Donne, her face set in a tense stare, refusing to bite on questions about Cambage\u2019s Game 3 trash talk. Cambage had suggested that the Mystics\u2019 frontcourt players might need to hit the weight room if they wanted to guard her, but Delle Donne couldn\u2019t have cared less about the sentiment or the social media fallout. She gritted her teeth through the group interview with the practiced boredom of a traveler in a TSA line at the airport.\n\nFor most of Game 4, they stuck to their differing scripts.\n\nAs Cambage racked up 25 points and 12 rebounds, the Aces\u2019 fans pleaded for Coach Bill Laimbeer to continue \u201cfeeding the beast.\u201d The Mystics\u2019 undersized center, LaToya Sanders, battled hard, but she eventually fouled out in 25 minutes part because of the physical mismatch.\n\nThe high stakes and high-intensity environment brought the best out of Cambage. She cupped her hand to her ear to encourage the crowd to yell at the refs. She screamed loudly and fist-pumped like Tiger Woods after a second-half basket. She chest-bumped one of her teammates after a late blocked shot. She played with such ferocity that she crashed to the court time and again, as if gravity was a new concept and she was a designated product tester.\n\nDelle Donne wore her trademark fixed gaze, preferring polite claps of encouragement and silent nods as the pressure mounted. Las Vegas\u2019s bids for momentum never shook her. When the crowd neared its peak levels with the Aces leading by one to close the third quarter, Delle Donne opened the fourth with total poise.\n\nThe 6-5 forward hit a tough up-and-under to quiet the crowd, grabbed a big offensive rebound to set up Emma Meesseman\u2019s three-pointer on a broken play, and then she drained a three-pointer from the top. Later, she stretched to get a hand on a pass and twisted to finish a tough off-balance shot in traffic, then drained a picture-perfect turnaround jumper to give the Mystics a three-point lead with less than three minutes to play.\n\nBut Delle Donne did it all exactly as she had promised: within the team concept.\n\n\u201cOur offense is so fluid that I don\u2019t try to force it,\u201d she had explained on Monday, when asked whether she ever feels tempted to assert herself when a game is slipping away. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we play. When we play one-on-one, it\u2019s not good basketball and it doesn\u2019t work for us.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne\u2019s trust was rewarded.\n\n\n\nEmma Meesseman (left) and Elena Delle Donne (right) celebrate the Washington Mystics' return to the WNBA Finals after eliminating the Las Vegas Mystics in Game 4 of a semifinals series. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nAfter an ugly showing in Game 3, Washington\u2019s offense responded by shooting 43 percent on three-pointers and four Mystics players finished in double figures. And it was Meesseman, who was held in check for Game 3, who hit a clutch midrange jumper with 29 seconds left that extended Washington\u2019s lead back to three and forced Las Vegas to call timeout.\n\nFinally, sensing the weight of the shot, the reserved MVP couldn\u2019t contain herself any longer. As Washington returned to the bench, Delle Donne sought out Meesseman for congratulations and yelped what sounded an awful lot like an unprintable curse word.\n\nMoments later, the Mystics were on the court celebrating their victory, which sets up a championship series against the Connecticut Sun. Delle Donne again ran after Meesseman to deliver forceful, grateful high fives.\n\n\u201cI swear I was about to kiss her,\u201d a giddy Delle Donne joked later, knowing her first WNBA championship is now just three wins away.\n\nRead more on the Washington Mystics:\n\nElena Delle Donne freed her mind, and a historic season followed\n\nThe Mystics are an anomaly in the WNBA: A juggernaut patiently built on character and fit\n\nFor Kristi Toliver, being injured for the first time means learning to let go", "description": "In a battle of dueling personalities and games, WNBA MVP Elena Delle Donne triumphed over Las Vegas Aces star Liz Cambage to lead the Washington Mystics to their second straight WNBA Finals.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter", "September At Am", "Ben Golliver Joined The Washington Post As The National Nba Writer In Previously", "He Was A Senior Writer At Sports Illustrated Covering The Nba.
