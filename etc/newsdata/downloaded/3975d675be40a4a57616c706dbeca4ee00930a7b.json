instead, our investigation suggests that people were coordinating and sharing the video via other online messaging services.\n\n'Once the video was removed, we shared the hash with an industry consortium to help prevent the proliferation of this content.\n\n'We take this extremely seriously and are committed to working with industry peers, law enforcement, and any relevant parties to protect our community.'\n\nThe gunman had only attempted a live-stream on Twitch once before, the company said.\n\nThe suspect was arrested last night and Germany's interior minister said it appeared to be an anti-Semitic attack, possibly motivated by far-right extremism.\n\nPolicemen climb over a wall close to the site of the shooting in Halle in former East Germany\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel greets members of the Jewish community at a vigil in Berlin on Wednesday evening\n\nTwitch, which has gained a following for live-streaming gaming, was acquired by Amazon for $970million (\u00a3790million at current prices) in 2014.\n\nWednesday's attack appeared to be the first real-world violence livestreamed on Twitch, said Hannah Bloch-Wehba, a law professor at Drexel University in the US.\n\nShe said it was hard to guess why Twitch was chosen, although she noted that recent attempts by Facebook and Twitter to crack down on such material may be forcing attackers to look for new outlets.\n\n'Filtering algorithms so far have not been very good at detecting violence on livestream,' noted Jillian Peterson, a professor of criminology at Hamline University in Minnesota.\n\n'Social media - and now livestreaming services -- have given perpetrators a larger stage and wider audience,' he said.\n\n'Perpetrators are looking to show their grievance to the world, and livestreaming gives them the means to do it.'\n\nSocial media sites came under pressure after the New Zealand mosque shooter uploaded a similar live-stream to Facebook as he killed 51 people in March.\n\nNew Zealand police said in the aftermath of the attack that they were 'actively investigating' other social media users who had shared the footage.\n\nBrenton Tarrant, 28, from Australia faces trial over the massacre.\n\nLast month Facebook announced additional efforts at the United Nations during a meeting with New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has taken up the cause of fighting online extremism.\n\nAlso last month, Amazon announced it was joining the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, an alliance tasked with tackling the most dangerous content on social media.", "description": "The gun rampage in Halle, Germany, was streamed live on Twitch, an Amazon-owned gaming site, and stayed there for another 30 minutes before it was finally taken down.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19514026-0-image-a-20_1570658722114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
