A person close to Mr. Cipollone denied that there was concern about bringing aboard another outside lawyer.\n\nBefore Mr. Gowdy could be added, however, Mr. Trump needed to meet with him. So the two sat down for lunch at the White House on Tuesday; Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, joined them for part of the meal.\n\nIt went pleasantly enough, people briefed on what took place said, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s skepticism of Mr. Gowdy, who has often tried to distance himself from the president. But by late in the day, Mr. Trump signed off on hiring Mr. Gowdy. Still, there were procedural issues to be dealt with before he could formally be announced, and some advisers to the president wanted to wait to make the move public. Those advisers were stunned to see the news emerge from the White House on Tuesday night.\n\nBut for Mr. Mulvaney \u2014 who has never been fully empowered in the Trump administration, with \u201cacting\u201d always part of his title \u2014 it was a rare internal victory. And the announcement that a well-known fighter like Mr. Gowdy was joining the team hinted that the Trump operation was finally organizing around an impeachment strategy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers worked on a letter for Mr. Gowdy to sign to cement their agreement. Around 8 p.m. they released a statement announcing that Mr. Gowdy was formally on board.\n\n\u201cTrey\u2019s command of the law is well known, and his service on Capitol Hill will be a great asset as a member of our team,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Jay Sekulow said in the statement.\n\nBut within 30 minutes of that statement\u2019s going public, Mr. Gowdy alerted Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers to a problem. His law firm, Nelson Mullins, had concerns that his work would involve lobbying activity. There was a discussion about whether Nelson Mullins could still be used, but a Trump adviser said that decision had been put off until January, when Mr. Gowdy\u2019s lobbying ban concludes.", "description": "The hiring of Mr. Gowdy and its quick reversal offer a public glimpse into the turmoil in the White House as it struggles to decide how to respond to impeachment.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Annie Karni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/us/politics/13dc-gowdy1/13dc-gowdy1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
