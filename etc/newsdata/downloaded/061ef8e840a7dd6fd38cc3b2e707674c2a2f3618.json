Though it's is a popular progressive view, he\u2019s planning to run for office as Republican.\n\nA. Wayne Johnson stepped down from his post at the Office of Federal Student Aid on Thursday, offering a blistering critique of a system that has saddled the average borrower with tens of thousands of dollars in debt that cannot be canceled or, increasingly, repaid. Americans owe $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, and 40 percent of them are expected to default on it by 2023.\n\nAlso on rt.com College students are increasingly finding \u2018sugar daddies\u2019 preferable to student loans - and can we really blame them?\n\n\u201cWhen \u2026 somebody has $40,000 in student loan debt and, because of forbearances or deferments and the accrual of interest, they wind up with $120,000, you have to step back and say this is fundamentally broken,\u201d Johnson told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe time has come for us to end and stop this insanity.\n\nJohnson wants to replace the existing system with a $50,000 credit for students looking to attend college, a credit that does not require repayment. For those already encumbered by debt, he\u2019d forgive $50,000 of it, which would cancel out the balances of some 37 million borrowers. Those who\u2019ve already repaid the money would receive a $50,000 tax credit.\n\nIf that sounds like a campaign promise, Johnson is running for the Georgia Senate seat that will be left vacant at the end of the year when Republican Johnny Isakson retires. He describes himself as a moderate Republican, though it\u2019s unclear how the one percent corporate revenue tax he proposes to pay for the $925 billion debt forgiveness plan will be received by the party that hates \u201cfree stuff.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com 66% of US college grads regret their education, study finds\n\nHowever, he reasons that corporations should be willing to \u201cinvest in training people\u201d since they are ultimately \u201cconsuming\u201d higher education.\n\nJohnson is actually the second Trump administration education official to resign in disgust. Seth Frotman, who was the student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau, left last year after seven years in the role, accusing the agency of \u201churting families\u201d and of abandoning students to \u201cserve the wishes of the most powerful financial companies in America.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
