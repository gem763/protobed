Japan have done it. There's the bonus point! Someone stick a fork in me. I'm done. 84 min: Japan 31-19 The Brave Blossoms crackle with power. Samoa are helpless. They're slowly pushed back... but the referee pulls up play. Japan to go again! 83 min: Japan 31-19 Crikey. Japan have forced the turnover from the scrum and now it's their turn to feed play. That's Jack Lam, who made the decision to initially scrum again, off the Christmas card list. Advertisement 81 min: Japan 31-19 Samoa win the scrum... and opt to go for another push! That means Japan still have the opportunity to get the bonus point. Irish and Scottish fans melting right now. \"Why didn't they just kick it out?\" 80 min: Japan 31-19 The referee's whistle goes. The Samoans have the put-in at the scrum. But it's irrelevant as the gong sounds for full-time. 79 min: Japan 31-19 Japan with a late line-out down in the Samoan corner. They're pushing for the bonus point here as every man and his dog joins the rolling maul. Thrilling, pulsating, absorbing scenes here in Toyota as the home crowd roars their team on, sucking them towards the white line. 76 min: Japan 31-19 (Fukuoka try) End-to-end stuff as Kenki Fukuoka caps off a fine team effort to all but wrap up the victory. Having secured the turnover off their own restart, Japan pushed their opponents back while simultaenously pulling them left. It created space out wide on the right and there, receiving play off a quick flash of hands among the backs, was the susbtitute to swerve around the scrambling Samoans and dive over. Advertisement TRY! Japan respond in style! 74 min: Japan 26-19 Samoa (Taefu try, Taefu conversion) Despite their best efforts, even Japan were unable to hold off the unrelenting pressure of the Samoans. Off their second throw-in attempt, the forwards crabbed sideways along the Japanese line, stealing inches at they went before play was popped up to Henry Taefu to muscle his way through a hole in the wall. The centre converts too. TRY! Samoa touch down - they're back in this! 71 min: Japan 26-12 Samoa Up the line-out goes, with Samoa safely collecting down in the left corner. Japan look rumbled as another penalty is conceded. With advantage to play, Tusi Pisi sends the crossfield kick towards the right but Kotaro Matshushima calmly collects. We go back for another Samoan throw. Advertisement 69 min: Japan 26-12 Samoa A tidal wave of blue shirts sweeps the Japanese back, with Ed Fidow leading the charge down the left flank. He gets the inside offload away but, with the hosts just about able to form their lines, Samoa are stopped five metres out. Play is recycled before the penalty is drawn. All of a sudden it's the Pacific Islanders who are back on top and knocking on the door. 67 min: Japan 26-12 Samoa Break! And it's James Moore who finds himself beyond the game line, bearing down on his opponent's 22. He's tackled but presents play for his supporting men to recycle. Samoa dig in, though, and snatch back possession before clearing their lines. We go all the way back for a Japanese line-out in their own half. 65 min: Japan 26-12 Samoa Michael Leitch has been subbed off by the way. He's run the tank dry. Another hugely influential shift from the 30-year-old. 65 min: Japan 26-12 Samoa Another morale-boosting moment for Japan as Ed Fidow is knocked into touch by the Japanese defence. The hosts with a line-out five metres or so out from their 22. It's clean, and away they go, taking play up to the half-way line to ease the pressure once again. Advertisement 63 min: Japan 26-12 Samoa Still Samoa come! They're throwing the kitchen sink at the Japanese. Plates, knives, bowls, the whole lot. But the Brave Blossoms aren't giving an inch. Off a dangerous line-out on Japan's 22, Steve Jackson's men send it right but once again, with his face and hands in the dirt, is Michael Leitch to steal play. What a player. What a night it's been for him. 60 min: Japan 26-12 Samoa Penalty to Japan! After a haphazard scrum, Japan dig deep, turn the screw and batter the Samoans with a ferocious display of physicality that completely catches out Steve Jackson's men. Jiwon Koo makes the turnover at the breakdown. Samoa penalised for not releasing. That could be a game-winning moment right there. 58 min: Japan 26-12 Samoa Samoa immediately hit back with a break and are rewarded for their efforts with a scrum five metres out from Japan's posts. 55 min: Japan 26-12 Samoa (Kazuki Himeno, Tamura conversion) Just what the doctor ordered. A superb team effort from the line-out! Japan immediately form a rolling maul off the throw that completely blows the Samoans away. From 15 metres or so out, it surged forward, stomping over the Pacific Islanders who were helpless to stop the Japanese engine before Kazuki Himeno grounded the ball. Up goes the crowds. A hugely important score. Yu Tamura with the extras.
