Personal resiliency is about our assets \u2014 the resources, attributes and skills that help us recover from negative experiences or emotions, cope with challenges and adversity and look after ourselves when things aren\u2019t going well.\n\nBuilding children\u2019s resiliency is not some special, extraordinary thing that parents do. It is more about \u201cgood enough\u201d everyday parenting and support in four main areas: relationships, emotional skills, competence and optimism. Here\u2019s how you can help build your child\u2019s resiliency assets in each area.\n\nRelationships\n\n\u2022 Eat meals together as often as you can.\n\n\u2022 Schedule special time with individual children to do things you enjoy together.\n\n\u2022 Show interest in your child\u2019s interests.\n\n\u2022 Be ready to listen when children are ready to talk.\n\n\u2022 If your relationship becomes strained by conflict, keep looking for opportunities to reconnect in positive ways. Never give up!\n\nRelevant Reading: How To Create Quality Time With Your Kids When There Is So Little Time\n\nEmotional Skills\n\n\u2022 Accept and respect children\u2019s feelings. Help them express their emotions and try not to make them feel bad for feeling bad.\n\n\u2022 Be sympathetic and comforting.\n\n\u2022 Share positive emotions with your children.\n\n\u2022 Teach the language of emotion. Use words to describe their feelings and your own.\n\n\u2022 Help your kids understand their feelings and other people\u2019s feelings.\n\n\u2022 Manage your emotions as best you can. Your modelling is the most powerful teacher.\n\nCompetence\n\n\u2022 Give children time for unstructured play. It helps them learn decision-making, problem solving and confidence in their own ideas.\n\n\u2022 Encourage and support children\u2019s interests. These interests develop skills and knowledge that help children feel like competent people.\n\n\u2022 Use positive discipline that helps children understand the impacts of their actions and behaviour.\n\n\u2022 Let them help you with household tasks like simple repairs, painting, window washing and gardening. This helps them build life skills that boost their sense of competence.\n\nOptimism\n\n\u2022 Gently (but kindly and realistically) challenge children\u2019s negative thoughts.\n\n\u2022 Show children alternative, more positive (but still realistic) ways of looking at negative situations.\n\n\u2022 Model realistic optimism and positive thinking.\n\n\u2022 Encourage respectful assertiveness and negotiation.\n\nMore Helpful Insight From The Psychology Foundation of Canada: How To Know If Fear Is Just Childhood Development Or A Mental Health Concern\n\nStress management: a key part of resiliency\n\nBeing able to manage stress is a crucial part of resiliency. Here\u2019s how you can help:\n\n\u2022 Learn to recognize the signs of stress in your child. If stress is a big factor, deal with that first, before you try to help your child problem solve or see a situation in a more optimistic way.\n\n\u2022 Help your child identify positive coping strategies. Some stress can be reduced or avoided, but not always. Help your child figure out what works for them, whether it\u2019s listening to music, physical activity, relaxation breathing or talking to someone who understands.\n\n\u2022 Be supportive. If your child wants to talk about stress, listen without judgment before rushing to lay on a solution. Other small gestures of support, like reducing chores when your child has a big assignment, can reduce your child\u2019s stress as well.\n\nProblem Solving, another key resiliency skill\n\nTeach your kids to solve problems using the following steps.\n\n\u2022 Can the situation be changed? Help your child figure out what aspects of the stressful situation they can control. If something can be changed, the answer is problem solving. When it can\u2019t, coping becomes the appropriate strategy.\n\n\u2022 Chunk it. Breaking a large problem and solution into smaller chunks (with a timeline if needed) can make it more manageable.\n\n\u2022 Consider alternatives. Brainstorming possible solutions shows your child that there is usually more than one way to solve a problem.\n\n\u2022 Make a plan. What exactly needs to be done? Who needs to be involved? What preparation do you need to do? What\u2019s the first step?\n\n\u2022 Supports and resources. Who can help or offer support? (Hint: It might well be you!) Where can you find information you might need to solve the problem?\n\n\u2022 Did it work? If your solution didn\u2019t work, go back to step one.", "description": "Personal resiliency is about our assets \u2014 the resources, attributes and skills that help us recover from negative experiences or emotions, cope with challenges and adversity and look after ourselves when things aren\u2019t going well.
