And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government,\u201d according to audio posted by the Verge.\n\nThat brought a swift retort from Warren, who in March called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).\n\n\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights,\u201d Warren tweeted.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has an open antitrust investigation into Facebook and a group of state attorneys general led by New York is also investigating.\n\nAnother senior Facebook executive told Reuters earlier this month the company is confident it would defeat an effort to break-up the company.\n\nZuckerberg also said \u201cbreaking up these companies, whether it\u2019s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues. And, you know, it doesn\u2019t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together.\u201d\n\nFacebook has come under criticism for not doing more to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nZuckerberg was on Capitol Hill last month for the first time since April 2018 when he testified before Congress. He also met with President Donald Trump.\n\nHe recently spurned a request to testify before a U.S. Senate panel and explained in July why he often skips public testimony.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go to every single hearing around the world. A lot of different people want to do that. When the issues came up last year around Cambridge Analytica, I did hearings in the US. I did hearings in the EU. It just doesn\u2019t really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up,\u201d he told employees.", "description": "Facebook Inc Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told employees in July he expected the company would face an effort to break up the world's largest social media company if Democrat Elizabeth Warren were elected president, according to audio of two internal company meetings from July published by The Verge.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435923559&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902XK", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
