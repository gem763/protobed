The backdrop of Atocha Station is the Iraq War, already souring globalism, America in decline. In 10:04, it is Occupy Wall Street, Hurricane Sandy, and growing questions in the Obama years about whether an American \u201cwe,\u201d in a Whitmanesque sense, is still possible. In The Topeka School, Lerner writes from the vantage of 2019, and from the premise that the collective is broken and common discourse has been derailed. The implicit bid of the book is that exploring myopic white male monologuists, simmering with rage in the Midwest in the late 1990s, might shed light on today\u2019s America.\n\nThe main action of The Topeka School takes place during Adam\u2019s final year of high school, in 1997. He is the son of two psychologists, Jonathan and Jane, who are members of a famous psychoanalytic institute called the Foundation, something like a \u201cMayo Clinic for the mind.\u201d Jane\u2019s research\u2014which remains vague but concerns romantic relationships\u2014has made her nationally famous. (Lerner\u2019s mother, Harriet Lerner, a clinical psychologist, rose to national prominence after writing a book about women\u2019s anger that sold millions of copies.) Jonathan is a therapist primarily for disaffected young white men of privilege, teenagers who seem to have everything but who suddenly turn angry, sullen, withdrawn, violent. Jonathan calls them the \u201clost boys.\u201d\n\nAdam isn\u2019t one of those boys, but he straddles two ways of being. He is part of the hyperintellectual, Freudian world of his parents, where the most successful men think calmly and talk calmly, where emotions require verbal \u201cprocessing,\u201d and where any adolescent outbursts are followed by \u201cthink[ing] along with\u201d his parents about the causes. At the same time, he is immersed in the teenage masculinity of late-\u201990s Topeka; among his peers, the most expressible emotions are rage or disdain, and the lingua franca is physical violence or torrents of freestyle rap in an absurd\u2014if earnest\u2014appropriation of a black culture they have no direct contact with.\n\nAt school, Adam falls in with the kids of the Foundation faculty; the boys among them have a tense and violent relationship with the sons of blue-collar Topekans. The estrangement of these two groups prefigures the elite-versus-real-America animosity that now dominates political and social rhetoric\u2014though what\u2019s striking is how similarly angry and anxious about the demands of masculinity all these young white men seem. Adam often feels lost and enraged for reasons he can\u2019t quite explain. His behavior at home grows so explosive that his parents insist he either see a therapist or learn biofeedback methods for regulating his emotions. He opts for the biofeedback.", "description": "Ben Lerner, portraitist of talkative men, explores the roots of white male rage.", "authors": ["Jordan Kisner", "Ben Lerner"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/08/CULT_Kisner_Topeka_WebLead/facebook.jpg?1566926230", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
