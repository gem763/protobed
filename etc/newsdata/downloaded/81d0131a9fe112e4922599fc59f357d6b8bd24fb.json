And some elements of the Trump team\u2019s impeachment strategy predated the current Ukraine scandal that sparked the Democrats\u2019 action.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday morning, shortly after the White House released a rough transcript of the July 25 call the president had with his Ukrainian counterpart that\u2019s now at the center of the controversy, Trump argued there was a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. He accused Democrats and \u201ccorrupt\u201d media of falsely portraying the conversation as a \u201ccall from hell.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Evan Vucci/AP More\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be a nothing call,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe summary of the call indicated Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s potential Democratic rival in the 2020 election. Providing the rough transcript and insisting it shows no misconduct is just one facet of the Trump team\u2019s response to the impeachment push. The president and his allies are also trying to turn the tables on Biden. Trump\u2019s response also includes pointing at prior calls for impeachment to argue Democrats have been determined to oust him from office from day one, a defense against a potential impeachment that his campaign had prepared well before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi actually announced plans to open an inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nFollowing the release of the transcript, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, released a statement describing the Ukraine scandal as \u201cjust another hoax from Democrats and the media.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Sept. 24, 2019.

The fact is that the President wants to fight the corruption in Washington, where the Bidens, the Clintons, and other career politicians have abused their power for personal gain for decades. The facts prove the President did nothing wrong,\u201d Parscale said, echoing language of a prior statement he sent out shortly after Pelosi\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe idea there is a \u201cBiden scandal\u201d centers on a dubious claim that, as vice president in 2016, Biden pushed Ukraine\u2019s government to oust a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board starting in 2014. While Joe Biden did call for the prosecutor\u2019s removal, he was one of many international leaders who did so in response to concerns about corruption. And Bloomberg News has reported that the investigation into Burisma had been closed prior to the vice president calling for the prosecutor\u2019s ouster. In fact, in late 2014, the Obama administration pressed the Ukranians to assist the U.K. in a separate investigation into Burisma\u2019s owner.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence, Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, began pressing the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens role in the prosecutors firing earlier this year.\n\nTim Murtaugh, communications director for Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, also suggested the Ukraine controversy is really about Biden in an email sent to Yahoo News on Tuesday morning, hours before Pelosi\u2019s announcement. Murtaugh argued that Democrats are trying to exploit a \u201cBiden scandal\u201d because they have \u201cwanted to overturn the legitimate results of the 2016 election ever since President Trump was elected.\u201d", "description": "Even before the Democrats announced plans for an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, the White House and President Trump\u2019s campaign were preparing a counterattack.", "authors": ["Hunter Walker", "White House Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pw8P82L6jrTInkvXM2y_6w--~B/aD0yMjQwO3c9MzM1OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/1edaa8c0-dfd7-11e9-9eb6-119a0a4e896d", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
