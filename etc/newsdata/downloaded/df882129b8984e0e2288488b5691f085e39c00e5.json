The right-hander, who was drafted by the Yankees in the first round in 2008 but did not sign, struck out seven and issued a career-high-tying five walks while throwing 112 pitches.\n\nCole improved to 4-1 in the playoffs with the Astros. He won his team-record 19th straight decision over a 25-game stretch since May 27 in which he has a 1.59 ERA.\n\nThe Astros backed Cole with early homers off Luis Severino (0-1) as Jose Altuve connected two batters in and Josh Reddick went deep leading off the second.\n\nHouston added two runs in the seventh when Altuve scored on a wild pitch by Zack Britton and Yuli Gurriel lifted a sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Yankees threatened in the first, second, fourth and fifth against Cole, putting at least two runners on base in each of those innings.\n\nCole opened the game by allowing consecutive singles to DJ LeMahieu and Aaron Judge and then walked Gleyber Torres to load the bases with two outs. However, he retired Didi Gregorius on an inning-ending grounder.\n\nIn the second, he struck out Aaron Judge to strand two runners, and in the fourth, he retired LeMahieu on a fly ball to the center field warning track with two on. The Yankees nearly took the lead in the fifth, but Gregorius flied out to right field on a ball that was inches away from being a three-run homer.\n\nCole then breezed through his final two innings and needed only 10 pitches in the seventh. The Yankees finally scored when Torres hit a one-out homer in the eighth off Joe Smith.\n\nWill Harris easily finished the eighth, and Roberto Osuna tossed a perfect ninth for the save.\n\nSeverino allowed two runs and five hits in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out six and walked three.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "NEW YORK -- Gerrit Cole dodged trouble at times and pitched seven shutout  innings as the Houston Astros beat the New York Yankees 4-1 on Tuesday to take  a...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
