It was also marked by a mix of African, Spanish and Portuguese music as well as traditional Church music.\n\nFrancis said the world is becoming increasingly \"elitist and cruel toward the excluded\", adding that it is the duty of Christians to look after all those left behind in a \"throwaway culture\" taking root in society.\n\n\"This means being a neighbor to all those who are mistreated and abandoned on the streets of our world, soothing their wounds and bringing them to the nearest shelter, where their needs can be met,\" he said.\n\nPeople could not remain indifferent to \"the bleak isolation, contempt and discrimination experienced by those who do not belong to 'our' group\", the pope said.\n\nFrancis then inaugurated a large statue in St. Peter's Square, showing dozens of migrants and refugees from different faiths and different periods of history.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by David Goodman)", "description": "Pope Francis on Sunday scolded countries that produce weapons for wars fought elsewhere and then refuse to take in refugees fleeing the very same conflicts.
