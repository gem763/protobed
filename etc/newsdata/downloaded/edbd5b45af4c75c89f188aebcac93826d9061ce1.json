REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) on Tuesday said it had no plans for further job cuts beyond the 18,000 positions it had previously announced.\n\nThe bank also underscored in a statement that a \u201csubstantial\u201d number of jobs will be cut in Germany, which is \u201cby far\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2019s largest location.\n\nThe lender, which faces a loss for 2019, earlier this year announced sweeping cuts and plans to close down some operations after it called off merger talks with rival Commerzbank (CBKG.DE).\n\nExecutives have said that all parts of the bank would be subject to cuts, without being more specific. The bank employs 91,700 people globally, of which 41,700 are in Germany, according to the bank\u2019s 2018 annual report.\n\nBloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Tuesday that about half of the 18,000 jobs cuts would occur in Germany as the bank tries to cut costs at its retail division.\n\n\u201cIt is too early to comment on specific details. Also we don\u2019t comment on specific regions/locations,\u201d the bank said in an earlier statement.", "description": "Deutsche Bank on Tuesday said it had no plans for further job cuts beyond the 18,000 positions it had previously announced.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438409127&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970OU", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
