When characters venture into space, \u201cthere are no banalities, no distraction from confronting your internal conflicts. The focus becomes elemental. What does it mean to be a person? What is our identity? There is no escaping that question in space, especially the farther you go,\u201d says James Gray, who directed and co-wrote \u201cAd Astra,\u201d opening on Sept. 20.\n\nEven in an infinite universe, it\u2019s becoming a challenge to bring original ideas to space movies. The galaxy is becoming crowded with them. Natalie Portman \u2019s \u201c Lucy in the Sky\u201d arrives in October; Ryan Gosling traveled inside Neil Armstrong \u2019s head in \u201cFirst Man\u201d last year. \u201cAd Astra\u201d seeks a unique space by connecting mankind\u2019s ceaseless exploration with physicist Enrico Fermi \u2019s famous paradox: If the universe contains hundred of billions of galaxies, why haven\u2019t we connected with aliens yet? (Sorry, no spoilers.)\n\nIn the film, Mr. Pitt is Roy McBride, an astronaut in the near future known for his ability to remain emotionless when facing stress. He\u2019s distant from people even when he\u2019s home. NASA taps him to travel to Neptune to either rescue or kill his father ( Tommy Lee Jones ), a pioneering astronaut who abandoned Earth when Mr. Pitt was a teenager, and who now may be sending deadly anti-matter blasts toward the planet.\n\nWhen characters venture into space, \u2018the focus becomes elemental,\u2019 says director James Gray, here with Brad Pitt on set of 'Ad Astra.' Photo: Francois Duhamel\n\nMr. Pitt\u2019s father, the first man to reach one deep-space planet after another, has forever been seeking something else, only paying attention to what was not there. Does an insatiable hunger for the next thing hurt our appreciation of what we already have? Mr. Gray, presenting Mr. Pitt and Mr. Jones as restless voyagers, offers this as a mostly male character flaw.\n\n\u201cI think being \u2018masculine\u2019 has done huge damage to the world,\u201d Mr. Gray confesses. \u201cI have a daughter and two sons. I see the way my daughter is encouraged by the culture to explore her inner life and her emotions. The culture does not support that my sons should look inward. I don\u2019t know why it would matter less to them.\u201d\n\nMovies have gone to space since their first flickering light. Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s made the whimsical silent short \u201cA Trip to the Moon\u201d in 1902. In the 1950s, space programs and the Cold War with Russia provided new inspiration. In \u201cForbidden Planet,\u201d released in 1956, a year before Sputnik, 23rd-century astronauts led by a youthful Leslie Nielsen visit a planet where a technologically advanced civilization suddenly perished.\n\nIn the 1956 film \u2018Forbidden Planet,\u2019 astronauts travel to Altair IV to discover the fate of an expedition sent there decades earlier.

There\u2019s a mysterious alien monolith and some swanky set design, but what it\u2019s about is mankind\u2019s journey from ape to human to something beyond, depicted by the giant baby \u201cStar Child\u201d at the end, says Michael Benson, author of the 2018 book \u201cSpace Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece.\u201d\n\nThe 1968 movie \u20182001: A Space Odyssey\u2019 with Keir Dullea as scientist David Bowman, explored themes of existentialism and evolution. Photo: Everett Collection\n\n\u201cThese attempts to show dramas unfolding in space are the way that we try to come to terms with the inexhaustible richness of nature and reality,\u201d says Mr. Benson, who also authored, \u201cCosmigraphics,\u201d assembling illustrations people have created throughout history to map the universe. \u201cAnd they\u2019re a kind of rehearsal for what might happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSolaris,\u201d directed by Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972 and reimagined in 2002 by Steven Soderbergh, explores the universe as an extension of our troubled minds, asking if love could be a cosmic force. So does Christopher Nolan \u2019s \u201cInterstellar,\u201d from 2014, which uses wormhole time-warps to explore how quickly our children grow up when we\u2019re busy with our important work. In \u201cGravity\u201d (2013), the void of space gives Sandra Bullock \u2019s character, a grieving mother, a rebirth.\n\nSpace is a blank slate that \u201cdestroys the need for specificity of social status, of class, of all these things that traditionally get hung on a story,\u201d Mr. Gray says. \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, I know what that guy\u2019s about. I see how he\u2019s dressed. I see the house he\u2019s living in.\u2019 There\u2019s none of that. Everyone has to wear that space suit because they have to survive.\u201d\n\nSandra Bullock and George Clooney played astronauts stranded in space in 2013\u2019s \u2018Gravity.\u2019 Photo: Everett Collection\n\n\u201cAd Astra\u201d (\u201cto the stars\u201d in Latin) is still a movie, not a meditation. There\u2019s a lunar battle scene reminiscent of \u201cMad Max.\u201d Mr. Gray says he worked to make the science at least plausible.\n\n\u201cThere are times when you have to stretch it a little,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we were to be totally accurate, Brad would look almost deformed because of zero gravity. He would look very puffy. You can\u2019t really do that. We tried to explain that he has something that shocks his musculature to stay toned.\u201d\n\nSpace may present endless mysteries, but Brad Pitt looking good isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What\u2019s your favorite space-themed movie?
