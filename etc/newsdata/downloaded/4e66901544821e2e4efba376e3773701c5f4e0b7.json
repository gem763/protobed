CHEAP!\n\nSome people love working up a sweat in the gym. Others, on the other hand, don\u2019t. For some it\u2019s an uplifting, almost meditative experience, but for different folks it\u2019s a painful, never-ending slog.\n\nWhile these two camps might disagree with each other about how much they enjoy exercise, there\u2019s one topic they\u2019re united on: working out with music makes it better.\n\nBanging tunes can help you push yourself harder, or simply distract you from the discomfort. On top of that, listening to your own music can help insulate you from whatever crap they\u2019re pumping through the gym\u2019s sound system. Basically, workout headphones are vital.\n\nAnd, would you look at that? There\u2019s a great deal running on the new Powerbeats Pro wireless earbuds! Right now, you can get a full $50 (or 20 percent) off their list price, making the headphones a very reasonable $200. What a nice surprise.\n\nNow, details.

They sync easily with iPhones, and even use the same chip as the AirPods, so you get a top notch performance.\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re an Apple user who wants a pair of workout headphones, the Powerbeats Pro are probably going to be your best shout. The hooks will keep them in your ears, and the general consensus across the tech industry is they\u2019re a great-sounding pair of earbuds.\n\nYou can currently pick the Powerbeats Pro up for $200 on Amazon, a 20 percent saving on their list price.
