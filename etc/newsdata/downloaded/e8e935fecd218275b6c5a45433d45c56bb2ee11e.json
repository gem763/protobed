But on X Factor: Celebrity, Samira Mighty, Wes Nelson, Zara McDermott and Eyal Booker are gracing prime time Saturday night telly to say otherwise.\n\nThe four twenty-somethings all lived under the watch of ITV2 viewers in the Love Island villa throughout the summer of 2018, unaware that there was a connection deeper than any short-lived fling, between an unlikely foursome.\n\nA year later, Simon Cowell came calling and Love Islanders were born.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018When we sat in the room together for the first time, we were like, \u201cIs this going to work? We don\u2019t know?\u201d But then when we did start to sing together, we just got stronger since,\u2019 recalled Wes to Metro.co.uk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTonight viewers will make their own minds up as the troupe take on Shawn Mendes\u2019 There\u2019s Nothing Holdin\u2019 Me Back, but the Love Islanders are keen to dispel the myth that reality stars have as much musicality as Ed Balls has rhythm.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think they were allowed to show us singing [on Love Island],\u2019 claimed Zara.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s such a hard pill for people to swallow that we have such a passion for music,\u2019 Wes continued. \u2018No one has ever understood that and why would they when they\u2019ve never seen it. Eyal was in a pop band from a young age, Samira\u2019s been on the West End, Zara\u2019s got a studio in her house, I was going to pursue a musical career had this not come along and now we\u2019ve all formed together.\u2019\n\nEyal Booker, Samira Mighty, Zara McDermott and Wes Nelson make up the Love Islanders (Picture: Getty)\n\nAside from Eyal\u2019s failed pop career, none of the Love Islanders were exactly famed for their vocal prowess, which made their addition to the X Factor: Celebrity line-up somewhat of a mystery. Their fellow islander, the famously loyal Georgia Steel, however, let slip several cast members auditioned for another shot at their 15 minutes of fame.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t know who auditioned, but all we know is that we all auditioned individually, and then they said to us, \u201cWould you be open to being in a band. And I was like yeah. Then a couple of weeks later, we walked into a room and they\u2019re all sat there and I was like, \u201cOh my God, hi\u201d\u2019 said Zara.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWes explained: \u2018Especially with this process, we\u2019re completely new to this. This is not our forte, we have no expertise on this, so you just trust the process. They obviously heard numerous people audition \u2013 so they put us together so they must feel we sound good together.\u2019\n\nBut the Love Islanders have a tough battle on their hands ahead with the likes of established singers Megan McKenna, Coronation Street and Lion King actress Victoria Ekanoye, and Grammy Award-winning Glee star Kevin McHale all eyeing up Simon Cowell\u2019s record deal.\n\nX Factor: Celebrity airs tonight at 8.35pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
