Art can handle my questions about blackness. I can have a soapbox if I want it.\u201d\n\nHis multi-screen installation, \u201cBack and Song,\u201d will be unveiled Oct. 5 in the soaring stone chapel of Girard College, a Philadelphia boarding school. The project, a commission of the art organization Philadelphia Contemporary and Thomas Jefferson University, subtly nods to the history of U.S. medical schools and hospitals treating\u2014and mistreating\u2014black patients.\n\nThe chapel at Girard College, a Philadelphia boarding school, is where the \u2018Back and Song\u2019 multi-screen installation will be displayed. Photo: Girard College\n\nMr. Young and a collaborating artist, Elissa Blount Moorhead, have been layering archival footage of traditional black healers with recent clips of black cultural leaders to illustrate the cathartic ways black communities seek healing on their own terms.\n\nMr. Young said he was motivated to explore the issue after reading a 2016 study by University of Virginia researchers that detailed the troubling reasons why black people are often under-treated for pain. (In the study of 222 white medical students and residents around the country, 40% of the students and 25% of the residents told researchers they thought black people\u2019s skin was thicker than that of white people.) After mulling the sad statistics and conferring with his wife, who works as a midwife, Mr. Young said he and Ms. Blount Moorhead decided they wanted the piece to \u201cturn away from what had been done to our bodies and look closer at the rituals and music that help us get through trauma.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts What intrigues you most about the \u201cBack and Song\u201d multi-screen installation and Mr. Young\u2019s expansion into contemporary art from cinematography? Join the discussion below.\n\nNext month, visitors entering the gilt-ceiling chapel will encounter a quartet of screens playing clips of figures from jazz legend John Coltrane to harpist Brandee Younger to Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, who dispensed nutrition tips in his 1967 book, \u201cHow to Eat to Live.\u201d The pair are still finalizing the montage but he said the environment will include elements of color therapy\u2014anything to conjure \u201cwhat healing looks and sounds like to me.\u201d\n\nGrief and cultural mending are familiar themes for Mr. Young, who spent much of his childhood in the Louisville funeral home owned by his grandparents, who hosted traveling jazz musicians who weren\u2019t allowed to stay at local hotels. They also collected art by modern mainstays like Romare Bearden, Charles White and Aaron Douglas. As a boy, Mr. Young said, he spent hours leafing through his grandmother\u2019s coffee-table books on Renaissance artists and black photographers. His early favorites included Gordon Parks and Roy DeCarava, who chronicled everyday black life in moody spotlight and shadow.\n\nPhotography led Mr. Young to study filmmaking at Howard University. In 2010 he wielded the camera for artist Leslie Hewitt\u2019s ode to Harlem, \u201cUntitled (Level),\u201d a film installation later exhibited at the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis. The collaborative experience was eye-opening, he said, because Ms. Hewitt \u201csaw me as more than a cameraman; she saw a tension in my work I could unpack.\u201d\n\nThe following year, he got his independent-film breakthrough with \u201cPariah,\u201d a coming-of-age story about a black lesbian directed by Dee Rees, who would go on to write and direct \u201cMudbound.\u201d Bigger films followed, including \u201cArrival,\u201d for which he became the second black cinematographer nominated for an Oscar. (He lost to Linus Sandgren and \u201cLa La Land.\u201d) Recently, he shot \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story.\u201d\n\nHe met Ms. Blount Moorhead after she and curator Rashida Bumbray invited him to make a work for an exhibition that took place in several art spaces across Brooklyn in 2014: \u201cFunk, God, Jazz and Medicine: Black Radical Brooklyn.\u201d\n\nHe asked Ms. Blount Moorhead to join him in the \u201cBack and Song\u201d commission for Philadelphia. They have relished \u201cexcavating the margins of history\u201d for footage, she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re both intellectually thirsty.\u201d\n\nWrite to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com", "description": "Bradford Young, the cinematographer of \u201cArrival\u201d and \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story,\u201d is preparing a multi-screen art installation that examines how black communities seek healing.", "authors": ["Kelly Crow"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109240/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
