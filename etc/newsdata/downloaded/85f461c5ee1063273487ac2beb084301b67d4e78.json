Lindsey Graham questioned the press while defending President Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201clynching\u201d to describe the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump faced backlash for comparing his impeachment to \u201ca lynching\u201d on Twitter. Graham was one of the only prominent Republicans to defend the president, saying , \u201cThis is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American.\u201d\n\nHe also criticized the media\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s comments and the impeachment inquiry as a whole.\n\n\u201cI'm going to let the whole world know that if we were doing this to a Democratic president, you would be all over me right now,\u201d Graham said Tuesday. \u201cNot one person is asking a question.\u201d\n\nGraham pointed out that Trump still does not know who his accuser is and criticized the closed-door process that has accompanied much of the impeachment inquiry so far. He said he could \u201conly imagine\u201d the difference in coverage the impeachment inquiry might have if a Democrat were in the White House.\n\n\"It shows a lot of things about our national media,\u201d Graham said, adding, \u201cWhen it's about Trump, who cares about the process, as long as you get him?\"\n\nSen.
