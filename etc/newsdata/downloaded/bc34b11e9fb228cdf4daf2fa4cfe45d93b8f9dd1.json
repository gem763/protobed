Some Ukrainian officials have been linked to anti-Trump messaging going into the 2016 election, but there's no evidence of collusion between Ukraine and U.S. Democrats, as Trump and some of his associates have proposed.\n\nSuch claims have played a key role in the House's rapidly unfolding impeachment inquiry, which centers on Trump's efforts to have Ukraine investigate 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden. Attorney General William Barr is also embarked on a probe into the origins of the Robert Mueller-led inquiry into Russian meddling, suggesting it may have been politically motivated rather than a sincere attempt to confront an actual threat.\n\nThe report dispenses with deflections, however, and reiterates the widely held consensus that Russia launched a coordinated attack on the integrity of the 2016 election. It comes with the sign-off of the full Senate Intelligence Committee, including members like Trump-friendly Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), who have taken to the press to explain the president's questioning of Russian meddling and apparent invitations to Ukraine and China to investigate Biden as either jokes or legitimate fields of inquiry.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nAnd it stresses that the threat of foreign electioneering is far from over.\n\nThe GOP-led panel outlined recommendations for how legislators, the federal government and tech companies can combat future online meddling, including calling on the Trump administration \"reinforce with the public the danger of attempted foreign interference in the 2020 election.\"\n\nThe committee called on candidates running for office and their campaigns to more carefully probe the information they share on social media to prevent the spread of election-related disinformation \u2014 an effort Democratic presidential candidates say has been under siege by Trump and his campaign\u2019s postings on Ukraine and other issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Trump to stop using Twitter to play into our adversaries\u2019 hands,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who sits on Senate Intel, tweeted after the report debuted. \u201cWith every deranged tweet, he advances foreign interests by dividing Americans.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the report urges tech firms to share more information with government agencies to thwart foreign disinformation efforts, and for lawmakers to consider legislation to better facilitate that sharing. It also calls on the executive branch to establish an interagency task force dedicated to monitoring and deterring foreign interference efforts online.\n\n\u201cAny solution has to balance America\u2019s national security interests with our constitutionally-protected right to free speech,\" Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said in a statement. \"Social media companies, federal agencies, law enforcement, and Congress must work together to address these challenges, and I am grateful for the cooperation our Committee has gotten from both the Intelligence Community and the tech industry.\"\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c0/64/06391b0f45ddbf612bbc107bc25e/20191008-richard-burr-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
