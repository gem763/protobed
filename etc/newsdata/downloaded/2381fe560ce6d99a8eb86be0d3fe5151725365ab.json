While I keep enjoying it, I\u2019ll keep doing it.\u201d\n\nOne of the perks of being an Ashes-winning captain is having friends in high places, and Paine said he now had a direct line to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to save it and I might ring him if we win this one,\u201d Paine joked ahead of the fifth and final test at The Oval.\n\n\u201cHe was pretty pumped. (His message was) along the same lines of messages we got from a lot of people back home in Australia - congratulations, everyone\u2019s proud of us, Steve Smith\u2019s a freak and make sure you finish it off this week.\u201d", "description": "Steve Smith's glorious Ashes has raised calls from some fans and pundits for his restoration to the Australia captaincy but incumbent Tim Paine has no plans to hand over the reins quietly.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428636597&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0O9", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
