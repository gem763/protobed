This is driving female players and referees out of the game.\u201d\n\nAnother ref said he is tired of being called a \u201cbigot\u201d for questioning players born as men for playing with the women. He even told the paper that he has witnessed five players with full beards claiming to be women and playing in the women\u2019s leagues.\n\nWelsh transgender player Kelly Morgan is ripping through the women\u2019s rugby league and is so over-powering on the field that even the team\u2019s coach has admitted that Morgan is hurting his own players in practice.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be a good, good player for the next few years,\u201d said coach Brian Minty, \u201cas long as we can stop her injuring players in training.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do feel guilty, but what can you do?\u201d Morgan told the BBC. \u201cI don\u2019t go out to hurt anybody. I just want to play rugby.\u201d\n\nThe story is little different in other countries. Last year, Australia transgender handball player, Hannah Mouncey, made news for powering through and decimating nearly every opposing team. Mouncey heavily outweighs, outmuscles, and towers over every natural-born female player in the league. In photos, Mouncey is literally a giant among Lilliputians.\n\nBut some scientists are beginning to doubt the efficacy of allowing transgenders to play with natural-born women. A recent study by three professors at New Zealand\u2019s University of Otago, concluded that men claiming to be transgender women do not lose much of their male prowess in sports despite testosterone loss, hormone therapy, and transgender surgeries.\n\nThe researchers concluded that \u201chealthy young men did not lose significant muscle mass (or power) when their circulating testosterone levels were reduced.\u201d\n\nThe research also pointed out that hormone therapy also cannot change a man\u2019s more powerful bone structure.\n\n\u201cFor example, hormone therapy will not alter bone structure, lung volume or heart size of the transwoman athlete, especially if she transitions post-puberty, so natural advantages including joint articulation, stroke volume, and maximal oxygen uptake will be maintained,\u201d the professors said.\n\n\u201cWe conclude that the advantage to transwomen afforded by the IOC guidelines is an intolerable unfairness,\u201d state the authors of the study.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Referees are quitting their jobs over fears of being sued as more transgender athletes join women's rugby leagues in Great Britain.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GTY-Kelly-Defina-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
