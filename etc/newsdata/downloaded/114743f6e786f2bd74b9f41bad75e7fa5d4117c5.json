Here are the details.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10 Range: What Aussies Need To Know \"More screen, more cameras, more choices.\" That's the mantra behind Samsung's Galaxy S10 range. There are four distinct models to choose from - including a futuristic 5G flagship that's going to be the phone to beat in 2019. Here are the specifications for all four Galaxy S10 phones, along with Australian pricing and release date. Read more\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S10e is the \"entry level\" phone in Samsung's flagship S10 range. It sports a smaller 5.8-inch AMOLED display, a slightly less powerful 3100mAh battery and a cheaper dual-camera array (a standard 12MP lens and the 12MP ultra-wide angle lens.) Otherwise, it's every bit impressive as its bigger siblings.\n\nAs mentioned, Optus' new S10e plan nets you a generous 30GB of data for $59 per month. To put that into perspective, Optus' previous S10e plan cost $75 a month and only came with a paltry 4GB of data.\n\nSo what's the catch? To get the $59 Samsung Galaxy S10e deal, you need to sign up to a 24-month plan. However, there are no cancellation fees if you decide to leave early. This essentially renders the contract meaningless. (You just need to pay out the remaining cost of the handset if and when you decide to bugger off.)\n\nIf you opt to stick with the plan for the full duration, you're looking at a total spend of $1416, which is only slightly more expensive than the phone's outright price at launch. When you factor in the free $249 Galaxy Buds, you're practically getting the plan for free.\n\nHere are the inclusions. (Click on the interactive table below to learn more.)\n\nNote: To get the free Galaxy Buds, you need to sign up before November 2.
