The central bank will announce its decision on interest rates on Wednesday. It is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third-straight time this year.\n\n\"Our best guess is that [chairman] Powell will not give a particularly dovish interpretation this week when they cut rates ... or a particularly hawkish one. He's going to tread in the middle of there and leave the option there to stop easing if he needs to,\" Hyman said.", "description": "To Evercore ISI Chairman Ed Hyman, the so-called Fed put is alive.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105328501-1531487573571gettyimages-609931900.jpeg?v=1572271752", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
