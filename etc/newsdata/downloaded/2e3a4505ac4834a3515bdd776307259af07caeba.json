(Kate McKenna/CBC)\n\nLiberal candidate St\u00e9phane Lauzon, a former teacher and Gatineau city councillor, took the riding from the NDP in 2015 and would like to hold on to it.\n\n\"I won by 43 per cent of the vote,\" Lauzon said. \"I feel people are still behind me.\"\n\nBut before that Argenteuil\u2013La Petite-Nation was Bloc country, from its inception in 1993 until it was swept up in the NDP's \"orange wave\" of 2011.\n\nIt seems voters are now kicking the BQ tires once again, reflecting the rise in Bloc fortunes in the polls since the first French-language leaders' debate.\n\n\"The Bloc leader was very ... good,\" said Melanie Tardif, an employment consultant in Lachute, about 125 kilometres east of Gatineau. Tardif said her mind isn't completely made up, but she's been disappointed with the Liberals on local issues.\n\nIn particular, Tardif was unhappy with last week's news that Agropur has decided to shut its dairy plant in Lachute, leaving 180 people out of work.\n\nThe Liberals snatched Argenteuil\u2013La Petite-Nation from the NDP by 9,000 votes in 2015. (Election-Atlas.ca)\n\n\"Where are [the Liberals]?\" Tardif asked. \"I think people are ready to have change.\"\n\nDestroismaisons, a social worker, lost his bid to become mayor of Saint-Andr\u00e9-Avellin in 2017, then lost again as a candidate for the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in the 2018 provincial election to Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec's Mathieu Lacombe. Destroismaisons is hoping the third time's the charm.\n\n\"I would like to make a difference in the riding,\" he said.\n\nBlanchet dropped by Lachute last Friday to support Destroismaison's bid. Standing beside the local candidate, he told a crowd the Bloc wants \"to be the conscience of the Quebec National Assembly in Ottawa.\"\n\nLiberal St\u00e9phane Lauzon is running for re-election in Argenteuil\u2013La Petite-Nation. (CBC)\n\nDestroismaisons said that message seems to resonate at the door, where the Bloc has championed Bill 21, the Quebec law that bans public servants from wearing religious symbols while on the job. According to polls, a majority of Quebecers supports the law, and people perceive the party's defence of it as a sign the Bloc will defend Quebec values in Parliament.\n\nDespite the party's sovereigntist goals, Destroismaisons said he hopes even federalists can appreciate that idea.\n\nNDP candidate Charlotte Boucher Smoley had a late start to the campaign, but she said she's been canvassing in earnest, hoping to remind voters why they elected an NDP candidate in 2011.\n\nShe said the party's platform is resonating with local voters, with a focus on boosting pensions and housing, as well as investing in infrastructure to make the region more resilient to climate change and the flooding that comes with it. She said she's also encouraged by the growing support for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in the province.\n\nBloc candidate Yves Destroismaisons canvasses in Saint-Andre-Avellin in the final week of the federal election campaign. (Amanda Pfeffer/CBC)\n\nBut Quebec polls suggest Singh's popularity hasn't translated into the level of support needed to fend off the Bloc in many NDP-held ridings, let alone ones the party lost last election.\n\nThe Liberals had hoped to get a chance at some of those volatile NDP seats, but are now concerned about their owne seats in ridings like Argenteuil\u2013La Petite-Nation.\n\n\"They had been counting on Quebec to deliver them a lot of seats to help them make up for losses in other parts of the country, but now it's more of a question of which seats they can prevent from going over to the Bloc,\" Grenier said.\n\nCharlotte Boucher Smoley is the NDP candidate in Argenteuil\u2013La Petite-Nation. (CBC)\n\nOne thing going for Lauzon and the Liberal is the fact that Argenteuil\u2013La Petite-Nation was redistributed in 2015 and now includes just 70 per cent of the former riding of Argenteuil\u2013Papineau\u2013Mirabel, its eastern-most region. At the same time, the riding gained 30 per cent of the more federalist Pontiac riding to the west.\n\nIn Saint-Andr\u00e9-Avellin, voter Alice Gratton-Blais said while she's heard plenty of talk about the need for change, she craves political stability. That means supporting Lauzon's bid for re-election.\n\nThe other candidates in Argenteuil\u2013La Petite-Nation are Conservative Marie Louis-Seize, the Green Party's Marjorie Valiquette and Sherwin Edwards of the People's Party of Canada.", "description": "The Liberal Party has a fight on its\u00a0hands to hang on to western Quebec's eastern-most riding\u00a0as polls suggest a surge in support for the Bloc Qu\u00e9becois.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5321008.1571146661!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bloc-quebec-flag.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
