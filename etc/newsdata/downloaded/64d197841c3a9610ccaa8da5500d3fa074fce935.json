Consider what Shaub wrote via Twitter:\n\n\u201cIn case it\u2019s not clear from my freaking out, this G-7 thing is an escalation. It may look from the outside like it\u2019s been corruption all along \u2013 because it has been \u2013 but participating in a contract award to yourself is different by orders of magnitude. This is a red line crossed.\u201d\n\nI strongly agree, though I also think it\u2019s worth pausing to appreciate why this latest presidential gambit is considerably worse than the more mundane corruption that\u2019s practically served as background noise for the Trump presidency.\n\nAt issue is a once-obscure provision of the U.S. Constitution known as the \u201cEmoluments Clause.\u201d As regular readers know, the clause prohibits U.S. officials from receiving payments from foreign governments. Traditionally, this hasn\u2019t been much of a problem for sitting American presidents \u2013 but in the Trump era, things are a little different.\n\nFor example, the president owns a hotel that sits roughly a half-mile from the White House, which hosts international officials with some regularity. The result is a dynamic in which foreign governments have spent quite a bit of money at a Trump-owned property, to the benefit of the American president and his private-sector enterprise.\n\nThe result, not surprisingly, has been a series of court cases challenging the legality of Trump\u2019s business practices.\n\nOne of the core defenses for the president has been the idea that the foreign officials are making a private decision on their own, without interference from Trump. In other words, if Saudi Arabian leaders are visiting the nation\u2019s capital, and they happen to book rooms at a prominent D.C. hotel in a great location, that\u2019s not the president\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not like Trump told them to do business at one of the facilities he owns.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of problems with the defense, but the argument itself helps underscore why the new G7 scandal is qualitatively different.\n\nWe\u2019re watching a passive-vs-active problem play out.\n\nWhen Saudi Arabia books rooms at the Trump International Hotel in D.C., and some of the profits from the transaction end up in the American president\u2019s pocket, Trump can defend the arrangement by saying it\u2019s entirely passive: he played no role in the Saudis\u2019 decision.\n\nThat defense disappears with the G7 summit: it\u2019s all active corruption, not passive corruption. Trump, in no uncertain terms, is telling some of the world\u2019s most powerful leaders if they wish to participate in next year\u2019s international gathering, they will have to spend quite a bit of money at one of his struggling businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s conscious. It\u2019s deliberate. It\u2019s direct. Trump knows the Constitution prevents him from receiving payments from foreign governments, but he\u2019s brazenly trying to pull off this gambit anyway \u2013 not just welcoming foreign money, but also insisting upon it.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), once again indifferent to presidential wrongdoing, was quoted yesterday saying, in response to the president awarding himself a lucrative contract, \u201cI don\u2019t think it changes anything. I just think it\u2019s another day in the life of Washington, D.C., these days.\u201d\n\nThis made it sound as if Trump\u2019s scheme were somehow common. The opposite is true: Americans have never seen anything like this.\n\nRep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees, told the Washington Post\u2019s Paul Waldman and Greg Sargent yesterday that \u201che\u2019s been discussing with other Democrats the prospect of holding a House vote on a resolution disapproving of Trump\u2019s decision on Doral, as well as of his continued violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses via his acceptance of untold sums from foreign officials and governments, and the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Raskin added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine a comprehensive impeachment resolution that does not refer to the president\u2019s repeated and continuing violations. The get-rich-quick scheme that the president has cooked up with the G-7 and Doral has the kind of alarming public clarity that the Ukraine shakedown does. The president is essentially writing his own impeachment articles.\u201d", "description": "When Trump's DC hotel hosts foreign officials, it's passive.
