I look forward to working with her through the end of her term, and I will be running for Chair of the Appropriations Committee in the next Congress,\u201d DeLauro, currently the fifth-ranking Democrat on the panel, said in a statement.\n\nThe challenge sets the stage for a fierce fight next year for control of one of the most powerful committees on Capitol Hill. And others are signaling they may enter the running, as well.\n\nRep. David Price David Eugene PriceA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Yes, President Trump, we do have a homelessness crisis and you're making it harder for us to address Two years after Maria, Puerto Rico awaits disaster funds MORE (D-N.C.), the sixth-ranking Democrat on the panel, did not rule it out on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhen the time comes, I look forward to talking with colleagues about Appropriations Committee leadership, both of the full committee and of key subcommittees, as we fill major gaps that Chairwoman Nita Lowey\u2019s retirement will leave,\u201d Price said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nOther senior Democrats on the committee, including Reps.

Roybal-Allard's office said the congresswoman is endorsing DeLauro to be the next chair.\n\nVisclosky, who is next in line in seniority behind Kaptur, said he has \u201cno intention\u201d of running to be chairman of the full committee. He controls the gavel of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, which controls hundreds of billions of dollars for Pentagon programs.\n\nWhether more lawmakers will jump into the contest is unclear. As of Thursday afternoon, a number of other top committee Democrats \u2014 including Reps. Barbara Lee Barbara Jean LeeThe 13 House Democrats who back Kavanaugh's impeachment Lawmakers mourn death of 'Julia' star Diahann Carroll Democrats see whistleblower report as smoking gun MORE (Calif.), Debbie Wasserman Schultz Deborah (Debbie) Wasserman SchultzDemocrats walk tightrope in fight over Trump wall funds Parkland father: Twitter did not suspend users who harassed me using name of daughter's killer Hillicon Valley: Senate Intel releases election security report | GOP blocks votes on election security bills | Gabbard sues Google over alleged censorship | Barr meets state AGs on tech antitrust concerns MORE (Fla.) and Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumTrump impeachment calls snowball, putting pressure on Pelosi Leave park operations \u2014 and fee revenues \u2014 to the parks Federal watchdog: Trump admin broke law by pulling from park entrance fees during shutdown MORE (Minn.) \u2014 had not weighed in.\n\nKaptur issued a statement Thursday evening stressing the importance of wrapping up the committee's near-term work while Lowey is still at the helm. But when the time comes, she said she'll seek the gavel.\n\n\"Though it is far too early for the Democratic Caucus to begin considering successors to that position, I am interested in placing my name for consideration as the committee member with the most experience and seniority when the time is appropriate,\" she said.\n\nKaptur, who was first elected in 1982, is no stranger to challenges to her ascension on the Appropriations Committee. Although Democrats typically adhere to a seniority system when deciding committee heads, Lowey defeated the more senior Kaptur to win the ranking member position on the panel in 2012, following the retirement of former Chairman David Obey (D-Wis.).\n\nKaptur, at the time, chalked up the loss to the lopsided power dynamics in the Democratic Caucus between the heavily represented coasts and the lesser represented heartland. That regional disparity was a major factor in Pelosi\u2019s leadership shakeup following the 2016 cycle, and Democrats since then have sought to iron out the regional disparities in their ranks.\n\nHow those dynamics might influence a Kaptur-DeLauro race remain to be seen. Several Democratic lawmakers and top aides said DeLauro would be a strong contender, if not the front-runner, to replace Lowey.\n\n\n\nDeLauro also has a built-in advantage in the race: She leads the Democratic Steering Committee, the very panel which recommends to the full caucus which lawmakers should receive committee gavels.\n\n\n\n\u201cDeLauro would have an upper hand, despite seniority,\u201d said one House Democratic lawmaker watching the evolving race.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s the front-runner,\u201d added a top aide to a Democratic appropriator.\n\n\u2014Updated at 5:58 p.m.", "description": "The jockeying to replace Rep.
