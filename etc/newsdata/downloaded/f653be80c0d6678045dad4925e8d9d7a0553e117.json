If there\u2019s a Labour Brexit, for me, I would then want to advocate that Labour deal,\u201d Trickett said, speaking in his Yorkshire constituency of Hemsworth.\n\nA close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, Trickett said Labour leave voters must be given a credible option to support in any referendum \u2013 which would appear to rule out backing a public vote on a Boris Johnson deal.\n\n\u201cThere are a large number of people in my constituency who remain attached to the idea that we ought to leave. I think if Labour is to attach ourselves to the idea of a second referendum, we have to offer them an opportunity of voting for a Labour Brexit.\u201d\n\nQuick guide What Vote Leave leaders really said about no-deal Brexit Show Hide Boris Johnson, prime minister Johnson told the Treasury select committee in March 2016: \u201cOur relationship with the EU is already very well developed. It doesn\u2019t seem to me to be very hard \u2026 to do a free trade deal very rapidly indeed.\u201d Speaking at a Vote Leave event in March 2016, Johnson said: \u201cI put it to you, all those who say that there would be barriers to trade with Europe if we were to do a Brexit, do you seriously believe that they would put up tariffs against UK produce of any kind, when they know how much they want to sell us their cake, their champagne, their cheese from France? It is totally and utterly absurd.\u201d Johnson, then foreign secretary, told the House of Commons in July 2017:\u201cThere is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.\u201d Dominic Raab, foreign secretary Two months before the June 2016 referendum vote, Raab told Andrew Neil on BBC Sunday Politics: \u201cWe\u2019re very well placed, and mutual self-interest suggests we\u2019d cut a very good deal and it\u2019s certainly not in the European\u2019s interests to erect trade barriers.\u201d During an appearance on the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics in April 2016, Raab added: \u201cThe idea that Britain would be apocalyptically off the cliff edge if we left the EU is silly.\u201d Michael Gove, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster In April 2016, Michael Gove said the UK would have the best of both worlds. \u201cOutside the EU, we would still benefit from the free trade zone which stretches from Iceland to the Russian border,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we wouldn\u2019t have all the EU regulations which cost our economy \u00a3600m every week.\u201d Liam Fox, former international trade secretary After the referendum, in July 2017, the then-international trade secretary Liam Fox said: \u201cThe free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. We are already beginning with zero tariffs, and we are already beginning at the point of maximal regulatory equivalence, as it is called. In other words, our rules and our laws are exactly the same.\u201d Simon Murphy and Frances Perraudin\n\nHis intervention comes amid mounting pressure on Labour to support efforts to tag a referendum on to any Brexit deal Johnson brings to parliament at a special sitting that is expected to be held next Saturday.\n\nThat could then result in a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d being held before a general election. But Corbyn signalled his caution on Sunday about the idea of backing a Brexit deal in exchange for a referendum, a view echoed by Trickett.\n\n\u201cI support the conference decision, and Jeremy\u2019s view, which is to vote down any Tory deal in the house, and then immediately press on to trying to remove the government,\u201d Trickett said. \u201cI think that is the order in which things should be done.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cA referendum before the election would imply a Tory Brexit against remain. I believe that the majority in the country voted for leave \u2013 and I feel that a Labour Brexit can only be delivered by a Labour government. So whichever way you look at it, you are back to the proposition that you have an election, you do the negotiation \u2013 and then you have the referendum.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s policy has evolved in a series of steps since the 2017 general election, which the party fought on a platform of honouring the referendum result.\n\nAt the party\u2019s conference in Brighton last month, it was agreed that if Labour won a general election \u2013 which could come within weeks \u2013 Corbyn would aim to negotiate a revised Brexit deal, including a customs union, within three months, and put it to a public vote within six.\n\nSeveral shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, have already said they would campaign for remain in that vote. But the Labour leader has declined to say which side he would take.\n\nTrickett suggested Corbyn could take a neutral role. \u201cIf he wants to unify the country, I could see an argument for him saying, \u2018I will implement whatever decision is taken,\u2019\u201d he said. And he urged pro-remain party members not to try to push Corbyn any further, saying: \u201cDo not tie our leader to a position which he thinks is not quite the right one to try to get us into an election victory.\u201d\n\nWhile Starmer has warned that failing to back remain is hurting the party in north London constituencies like his, Trickett said that in Hemsworth, the EU was the least of his constituents\u2019 worries.\n\n\u201cWhen I go round my patch, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say this, actually Brexit isn\u2019t mentioned that much. People who are very, very impassioned by Brexit will talk about nothing else. But the vast majority of people are talking about bus services, cuts to the health service, the cost of living,\u201d he said.\n\nThis rotten government is too riven with division to unite parliament | Jon Trickett Read more\n\nCertainly, as the \u201cwomen of Wakefield\u201d, as Trickett jokingly calls them \u2013 a group of local campaigners and community volunteers \u2013 meet to chat over tea and biscuits in his constituency office, Brexit barely comes up.\n\nInstead, they raise the depredations of universal credit, which has led to burgeoning use of food bank in the area; the lack of opportunities for young people; and the long shadow cast by the miners\u2019 strikes of the 1970s and 80s.\n\n\u201cFood banks have been around since 2005, when I founded the first one up at the other end of the district. There\u2019s now 22 food banks, and they are all working flat out. We\u2019ve not seen anything like we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d said Gwen Page.\n\n\u201cWe can all tell you some horror stories: it\u2019s getting worse. Holiday hunger has been something we\u2019ve all seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople come in, and they\u2019re in tears, and they\u2019re crying,\u201d said Leda Prest. \u201cPeople walk in \u2013 and they couldn\u2019t bring the child, because they\u2019ve got no shoes to put on the child\u2019s feet. I was there yesterday, and we handed out 40 packs of food. We do that five days a week.\u201d She added: \u201cJust two words: universal credit is the issue.\u201d\n\nJohnson hopes his \u201cget Brexit done\u201d campaign will help win over voters in constituencies like Hemsworth, where the Tories have never had a foothold (it has been Labour-held since 1918, and Trickett\u2019s majority in 2017 was more than 10,000).\n\nWhile these women are staunch Labour supporters, they admit friends and family members are intrigued by Johnson, seeing him as fresh and different to other politicians. \u201cPeople are falling out over it: badly,\u201d said Melanie Burnell.\n\nAnd they say political debate has become increasingly fraught \u2013 particularly over Brexit.\n\nTrickett, who was closely involved in planning the 2017 campaign, and sits on Labour\u2019s national executive committee, said the party was ready to challenge Johnson at a general election, despite its uninspiring opinion poll scores.\n\nHe believes Labour will still be able to squeeze the Conservatives when voters ask themselves who they want to run the country for the next five years.\n\n\u201cAt a general election, people are going to have to decide. Because he is a Tory: he\u2019s not standing above party,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI think it will focus back on the old divisions between a centre-left route for the country or a centre-right route for the party. That\u2019s what it\u2019s going to boil down to in the end.\u201d", "description": "Shadow cabinet member argues party\u2019s leave voters have to be provided with a credible option in a second referendum", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Gary Younge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5244fe78e6f529d19a25aa07bbee2e1193476163/0_113_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d42248d003a62fa0b709bfb57275cc03", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
