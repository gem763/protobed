Chance the Rapper stars in Saturday Night Live\u2019s Oscar Bait parody, Space Mistakes, as a heroic astronaut confident in his ability to soar among the stars without biffing something major, like cracking the windshield of the International Space Station or punching a hole in the hull, through which gallons of space start pouring in.\n\nUnfortunately, you can tell from his son\u2019s childlike trust and his wife\u2019s emotional emotions, Chance is absolutely going to slip up in space. Don\u2019t worry! He won\u2019t die. That\u2019s for his B- and C-list co-stars to deal with. So keep Chance in mind while you\u2019re casting your Academy Awards ballot this winter. If Space Mistakes doesn\u2019t win, there\u2019s always the movie\u2019s upcoming sequel, Space Mistakes 2: Space Is Also a Metaphor for My Dad.", "description": "Chance the Rapper stars in Saturday Night Live\u2019s parody of Oscar bait space movies like Ad Astra and Interstellar, Space Mistakes.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/27-Chance-SNL-Space-Mistakes.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
