Though Cincinnati stiffened after that, the damage had been done in a 23-17 defeat.\n\nYes, Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson ran for 152 yards and threw for 236. Sure, Baltimore amassed 497 yards - including 269 on the ground.\n\nWhat matters to Taylor, besides the final score, is that the Ravens managed only six points over the final 44 minutes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what the stats say, they buckled down,\u201d Taylor said of his defense. \u201cThey gave up two field goals there the remainder of the game. That\u2019s what we needed from them. That\u2019s the response we needed. That\u2019s not a normal response from a team that\u2019s 0-5 at the time.\u201d\n\nA defiant Taylor deflected questions about whether he should give up play-calling duties and focus on the bigger picture to turn his struggling team around.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve won zero games and have not scored enough points. That 100 percent falls on me,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut I do like the communication we have as a staff. We\u2019re on the same page when the calls come out, regardless of who calls it.\u201d\n\nTaylor pointed to the way the Bengals performed on the road against the AFC North leaders as a reason for hope rather than frustration.\n\n\u201cYou can throw every stat at me you want - we\u2019re not scoring points, we\u2019re not scoring touchdowns, our red zone efficiency is terrible - but the bottom line is we\u2019re 0-6 and our team\u2019s got more fight than anybody I\u2019ve been around,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI just told them: When we do find that way, it\u2019s going to be the most rewarding win you\u2019ve ever had in your entire life.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals didn\u2019t make things easy on themselves Sunday, allowing the Ravens to roll up a 212-6 edge in offensive yards and an 11-0 advantage in first downs in the first 15 minutes.\n\nBut after quarterback Andy Dalton scored from the 2 with 1:28 left, Cincinnati lined up for the onside kick with the hope of pulling out a victory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some great guys here, we\u2019ve got guys that are sticking together,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cFor us to get things turned around, it has to be that way.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s also important is getting off to a faster start. For three straight games now, the Bengals have failed to score an offensive touchdown over the first three quarters. That\u2019s how a 7-0 lead becomes a 20-10 deficit with 15 minutes left.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be better in the first half,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe have to put points on the board and take the pressure off the defense.\u201d\n\nNext week, the Bengals host Jacksonville in their quest to get their first win under Taylor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one person in this locker room who has quit on us,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe mood is still (ticked) off that we haven\u2019t found a way to the win, but everyone still believes.\u201d\n\nAs a youth, Bengals linebacker Preston Brown watched many a Cincinnati team struggle from start to finish. He can only hope this isn\u2019t one of those clubs.\n\n\u201cI grew up seeing 2-14 teams, and it\u2019s something I never wanted to be a part of,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying each and every week to get that first win. We know what the whole city wants, and we\u2019ve got to get this win.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Cincinnati Bengals can't stop the run, score touchdowns when they reach the red zone or catch one of those timely breaks that can turn the tide on the most frustrating of seasons.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/bengals_ravens_football_87096_c0-196-4708-2942_s1200x700.jpg?c65b468253e4821d1f03c9811665ca337520aa0a", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
