The idea is that there could of course be a no-deal Brexit, which investors do not like. They do not like the idea of the uncertainty or the potential chaos that that could bring,\" she said.\n\nPound v Euro\n\n\"If the members of Parliament do manage to block a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month, then that is likely to push sterling up,\" Ms Foley added.\n\n\"That said, political uncertainty and a general election will likely push sterling down.\n\n\"Sterling will remain a very vulnerable currency.\"\n\nPolitical earthquakes inevitably cause tremors in the currency markets. After all, the value of the currency broadly reflects the faith investors have in the prospects of a country. And with the City just a mile or two from Westminster, it's physically impossible for traders to ignore the turmoil.\n\nBut do wobbles on foreign exchange markets matter to the rest of us? They do - and perhaps more than we want to know. A weaker pound, of course, makes holidaying abroad more expensive (but cheaper for overseas tourists to visit the UK).\n\nBut it also makes imports dearer, bumping up the cost of our shopping list. Take food, for instance. About half of what we eat comes from overseas. The pound has fallen over 10% against the euro and about 20% against the dollar since 2016.\n\nBig companies tend to try to insure or \"hedge\" against currency movements, but within a matter of a few months, those changes in price tend to feed through. It's enough to make everyday staples or impulse buys feel a bit more like little luxuries.", "description": "Sterling edges above $1.20 and \u20ac1.10 as Prime Minister Boris Johnson loses his Commons majority.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/114AD/production/_108592807_currency_getty.jpg"}
