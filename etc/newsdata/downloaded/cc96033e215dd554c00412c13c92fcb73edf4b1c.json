The Israeli army said the drone released \"what seems to be an explosive device\" and lightly damaged an army vehicle near the fence.\n\nNetanyahu is in the midst of a reelection campaign, with less than two weeks before a do-over vote after he failed to secure a parliamentary majority in April's election.\n\n\"Hamas is responsible for everything coming out of Gaza and all attacks will be met with a vigorous response,\" Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\nHamas, which has run Gaza since 2007, is known to be developing a drone program and has used it before for reconnaissance missions over the frontier and into Israel.\n\nAlso Saturday, an Israeli father and son were stabbed near the town of Qalqilya in the northern West Bank. Israeli medical services said the 17-year-old was in a serious but stable condition. The military said that the pair was attacked by a Palestinian and that soldiers were in pursuit.\n\nOn Friday, Israeli forces fatally shot two Gaza teenagers during regular weekly protests along the volatile perimeter fence. Militants in Gaza fired five projectiles into Israel in an apparent response to the deaths.", "description": "Israeli aircraft hit several military targets for Gaza's Hamas rulers late Saturday after militants used a drone to drop a bomb on the Israeli side of the Gaza-Israel perimeter fence.
