The networks said in a statement that their goal was to replace the guest-checkout process.\n\nThe various companies are teaming up instead of going it alone \u2014 much like they did in adopting chip technology in cards in the 2000s and other advances in point-of-sale payments decades earlier.\n\n\"There are some instances in our industry where doing things together with our competitors has a meaningful benefit on scale,\" Linda Kirkpatrick, the executive vice president of US merchants and acceptance at Mastercard, told Business Insider.\n\nRead more: We went to Mastercard's tech showcase, which featured biometric sensors and shrimp-tracking blockchain.

For brick-and-mortar retailers, processing all networks' cards using one physical terminal was preferable to having separate card readers for each network.\"\n\nRead more: Contactless tap-and-go cards are finally rolling out in the US. Mastercard, Amex, and Visa execs told us why it took so long.\n\n\"It's the first time in the digital world where we have a standard that allows consumers to pay the same way securely around the world,\" Jess Turner, the executive vice president of product and innovation at Mastercard, said.\n\nThe EMV Secure Remote Checkout will compete with digital wallets like Apple Pay and PayPal, which already have checkout buttons embedded at retailers. Apple Pay, for one, launched its \"buy now\" function in February 2018.\n\nPayPal has been partnering with online vendors since its initial public offering in 2002 and subsequent acquisition by eBay. Since splitting with eBay in 2015, PayPal has focused on signing partnerships with former rivals to secure its role as a leader in the payments space.\n\nRead more: Here's how PayPal turned over 40 rivals into partners to become the go-to payments provider after splitting from eBay\n\nThe EMV click-to-pay option will roll out with select merchants this year, with broader adoption expected in early 2020.\n\nCinemark, the nonprofit Movember, and the Japanese online retailer Rakuten are the first merchants to offer the click-to-pay button online. Papa John's and Saks Fifth Avenue are among the merchants expected to adopt it by the end of the year.\n\n\"We know that all commerce is going digital. Even in physical environments, merchants are finding a way to create a point-of-sale environment where you may be physically in the store, but you'll be paying through an app or kiosk,\" Kirkpatrick said.\n\nEMVCo \u2014 which stands for \"Europay, Mastercard, Visa\" \u2014 is a standards body that counts several major US credit-card networks as members.
