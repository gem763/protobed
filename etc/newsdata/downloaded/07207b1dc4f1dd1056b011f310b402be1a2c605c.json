They are places for splashing and screaming and laughing, often on rides that defy common sense, not to mention the laws of physics.\n\nBut a park in New Jersey routinely delivered a lot worse \u2014 bloody noses, bruises, broken teeth and bones, concussions and even death. People who spent a day at Action Park in its prime, in the 1980s and 1990s, often left with something to show for it: scars.\n\n\u201cPeople were bleeding all over the place,\u201d said Susie McKeown, who is now 52 and remembers going to Action Park after she graduated from high school more than 30 years ago. \u201cPeople were walking around the park with scraped elbows or knees.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe went home with her own badge of honor, having broken one of her front teeth on a ride that ended with a 15- or 20-foot plunge into a chilly pond. \u201cYou went so fast that if your chin hit the water at the wrong angle, you chipped your teeth,\u201d she said.\n\nShe is hardly alone, as far injuries go \u2014 or memories. Sports Illustrated recently published a 3,300-word article under the headline, \u201cRemembering Action Park, America\u2019s Most Dangerous, Daring Water Park.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2014, Cory Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey and a Democratic presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter, \u201cI\u2019ve got stories 2 tell.\u201d\n\nNow a documentary is on the way. Its title is \u201cClass Action Park,\u201d a reference to one of the many nicknames for Action Park. The park, about 50 miles northwest of New York City in Vernon, New Jersey, was long ago replaced by a far tamer destination, with different owners and a new name, Mountain Creek Water Park.\n\nAction Park \u201cwas funny, it was weird, it was hysterical, but there was a darkness to it,\u201d said Seth Porges, who made the documentary with Chris Charles Scott.\n\nA ride at New Jersey\u2019s notorious Action Park. (Andy Mulvihill via The New York Times) More\n\n\u201cPeople got hurt there. The hardest part of making this movie was: How do you portray that? A lot of people look back fondly on it as a coming-of-age experience. How do you reconcile the fun of it with the human toll?\n\nPorges\u2019 parents put Action Park on their vacation itinerary when he was a teenager growing up in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cI have these memories of impossible machines, water slides that seemed like they came from a Looney Tunes cartoon and this crazed atmosphere of chaos,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also remembers the way Action Park promoted itself in the 80s and 90s. \u201cThe ads portrayed the place as a family-friendly, wholesome, great place to bring your kids,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d get there and realize the reality of the situation was anything but.\u201d\n\nThe website WeirdNJ said two of the touchstones of growing up in New Jersey were being able to name all the places in the opening montage of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and being seriously injured at Action Park. At least 14 broken bones and 26 head injuries were reported in 1984 and 1985. Action Park eventually bought the town new ambulances to handle trips to hospitals.\n\n\u201cEven the Action Park employees jokingly refer to the place as \u2018Traction Park,\u2019\u201d as in broken bones, The New York Times said in 1983.\n\nBut there were deaths at Action Park: six between 1978, when it opened, and 1996, when it closed. (It reopened under different owners a few years later, only to close and reopen again.) Two deaths occurred within a single week in 1982. One victim was a 15-year-old boy who drowned in the notorious Tidal Wave Pool. The other was a 27-year-old man who was electrocuted on a ride called Kayak Experience.", "description": "Amusement parks are designed to deliver thrills.
