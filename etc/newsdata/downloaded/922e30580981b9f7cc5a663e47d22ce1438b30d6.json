But he thinks Facebook\u2019s attempts to protect it could backfire.\n\n\"As a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what\u2019s credible,\u201d Zuckerberg said Thursday. \u201cNot tech companies.\"\n\nIn a speech to a packed auditorium of Georgetown University students, the Facebook co-founder attempted to rebrand his massive advertising company as a global beacon for free expression. He framed the current debate over political speech across the internet as an historic inflection point for civil rights. And he defended his company\u2019s hands-off approach in that crucial moment \u2014 including its recent decision to allow politicians to lie in ads and other content.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t fact-check political ads. We don\u2019t do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to say for themselves what politicians are saying,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the same reason, if content is newsworthy, we also won\u2019t take it down even if it otherwise would conflict with some of our standards.\u201d\n\nThe speech came as 2020 candidates, namely President Donald Trump, have begun targeting Facebook users with a torrent of advertising, some of it with false or misleading claims. Political ads comprise a small portion of Facebook\u2019s $60 billion ad machine, and Zuckerberg said on Thursday that he\u2019s considered canning them entirely.\n\n\u201cFrom a business perspective, the controversy is certainly not worth the small part of our business they make up,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nBut banning them, he added, could favor politicians with better name recognition. What\u2019s more, it wouldn\u2019t be clear where to draw the line on ads about politics versus social issues.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be issues any way you cut this,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd I believe that when it\u2019s not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of greater expression.\u201d\n\nREAD: The Democrats unfriended and blocked Silicon Valley\n\nThat was a consistent refrain throughout the Silicon Valley executive\u2019s 35-minute speech Thursday. Making vague references to \u201cprogress,\u201d Zuckerberg argued that more speech is an inherent good for society and assailed critics that have lambasted the company\u2019s approach to content moderation.\n\n\u201cIn times of social tension, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want the progress that comes from free expression, but we don\u2019t want the tension.\u201d\n\nThe company is one of the world\u2019s largest censors by nature of having 2.3 billion global users, banning or downranking content including hate speech and violence. But only Facebook really knows where Facebook draws the line.\n\nPolitical ads have recently become a flashpoint in that debate. Last month, Facebook announced it had exempted politicians from third-party fact-checking, allowing them to put misinformation in ads. Soon after, the Trump campaign ran an ad falsely accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of corruption in Ukraine. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign subsequently ran its own spoof ads claiming Zuckerberg was endorsing Trump for reelection.\n\nIn a statement in response to Zuckerberg\u2019s speech on Thursday, Biden campaign spokesperson Bill Russo tore into the company for prioritizing \u201clies and conspiracy theories\u201d at the expense of other voices.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s \u201cchoice to cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little he has learned over the past few years,\u201d Russo said.\n\nBernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King, Jr., also panned Zuckerberg\u2019s speech after he made references to her father and other civil rights activists.\n\nREAD: Mark Zuckerberg thinks an Elizabeth Warren presidency could \"suck for us\"\n\n\u201cI'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\u201d King tweeted. \u201cThese campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\n\nLies aren\u2019t new to political ads, but Facebook\u2019s targeting allows campaigns to pinpoint voters to a much greater extent than TV and other types of media, which are more heavily regulated. The company doesn\u2019t share how that technology works. And legislation to improve digital ad transparency has died in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s remarks Thursday came as Facebook faces federal and state inquiries into its business practices and increasing political pressure from both sides of the political aisle. The tech executive didn\u2019t mention those complaints, instead framing Facebook\u2019s libertarian position on speech as part of a larger geopolitical struggle.\n\n\u201cUntil recently, the internet in almost every country outside of China has been defined by American platforms with strong free-expression values,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no guarantee that these values will win out.\u201d\n\nCover: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Georgetown University, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, in Washington.
