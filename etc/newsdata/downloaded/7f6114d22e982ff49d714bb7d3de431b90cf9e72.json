It is also exacting a much more personal toll, causing turmoil at home and within families as the violence escalates.\n\nPolice attempted to arrest protesters at Hong Kong\u2019s Prince Edward MTR Station, Aug. 31.

Some families are locked in arguments over the direction the protests have taken, including instances of arson and vandalism\u2014or argue over the purpose of the protests altogether. Some parents are turning against the government and police as the city\u2019s young protesters are violently arrested and blame officials for not doing enough to defuse the tensions.\n\nThis weekend saw some of the fiercest clashes yet, and on Monday, thousands of high school and university students boycotted classes. Organizers said an estimated 30,000 people attended a rally at the Chinese University of Hong Kong on the first day of term.\n\nThe Lius, a couple in their 50s, have a son in his 20s on the front lines. Mrs. Liu, who works as a caregiver at a nursing facility, fought with him when he first became involved in politics a few years ago. She initially pleaded with him to stay home this summer, but decided there\u2019s no point getting into shouting matches.\n\nThe Lius suspect he is on the streets most of the time, though he is vague about his plans. When he is out, they stay up all night waiting for him to come home. Mr. Liu, a store manager, paces around the house asking his wife every few minutes whether he has texted. Their son is more likely to reply to her than to him.\n\nThey keep his social media accounts up, taking heart when his WhatsApp status says, \u201cOnline.\u201d They have the TV on, and Mrs. Liu is on her phone and computer, too, constantly checking for news.\n\nThe Hong Kong media make it easy to follow the action. Dozens of yellow-vested reporters and camera operators position themselves in the most dangerous spots between the protesters and the police, broadcasting live video. Sometimes the Lius scan the live streams looking for their son. Every now and then they think they spot him, but with everyone covered in masks and helmets it can be hard to be sure.\n\nStudents gathered for anti-government protests at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sept. 2.

She discovered she had missed a dozen calls from her husband. Her son had been arrested. The police later came to search their house.\n\nWhat really terrifies Mrs. Liu is that her son, now released and back home, will be injured in the worsening violence. Mrs. Liu says she has never been a political person, but the toughening police response and the government\u2019s continued silence on addressing the protesters\u2019 demands makes her and her husband more sympathetic to the young people\u2019s cause.\n\nMore than 1,100 protesters, one just 12 years old, have been arrested in the past three months. Most are on bail awaiting to hear their charges, but could face yearslong sentences.\n\nA law that would allow suspects to be extradited to China kicked off the dissent in Hong Kong on June 9. Early marches were large and mostly peaceful. On June 12, the police began using tear gas and rubber bullets during skirmishes with protesters, raising tensions. Days later, the government suspended the extradition bill\u2014its only concession to date.\n\nPolice fired rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray on protesters on June 12.

This past weekend, the streams showed chanting protesters hurling Molotov cocktails and setting a number of fires.\n\nGrowing Wary Polls have found decreasing trust in police. What are your trust levels towards the Hong Kong police?* VERY UNTRUSTING May 23-June 5 6.5% June 17-20 22.5 Aug. 7-13 42.7 VERY TRUSTING May 23-June 5 10.3% June 17-20 12.4 Aug. 7-13 9.0\n\nThe police have also become more aggressive. Last month, undercover police officers dressed in black made violent arrests in the shopping district of Causeway Bay. Live-stream cameras focused on one protester, pinned to the ground by an officer\u2019s knee on his neck and his face covered with blood, screaming that his front tooth had been knocked out. Hong Kong has watched police charge into subway stations with batons and tear gas, chasing after suspects and, on Saturday, beating them in a train carriage. Water cannons have joined the fight, firing jets of blue-dyed water to mark protesters for future arrest.\n\nSunny, the wife of a police officer in her late 20s, says the two have been fighting for weeks about how the police have handled the protests. She often shows her husband video clips of police assailing protesters and has texted him while he\u2019s on duty to say: \u201cHey. Please think before you act out there,\u201d worried about what could happen in the heat of the moment.\n\nA cleaner removed a sign while police stand before covered graffiti outside the police headquarters in Hong Kong, June 22.

Her husband maintains that police are doing what is necessary to keep law and order, she says, while she\u2019s upset that his job requires him to not take a political stance.\n\nSunny blames the government for failing to start talks and seek a political solution. There has been little dialogue between the government and the opposition as protests enter their 14th week.\n\n\u201cThe government has thrown the police out there as a shield,\u201d Sunny says. She supports an independent inquiry into police handling of the protests, a key demand of the protesters\u2019 side. She says it might help heal the deep wounds between the two sides.\n\nThe police can deploy as many as 3,000 officers equipped with riot gear on the streets, with hundreds more able to be called up in reserve. More than 1,600 police officers and their family members have had their personal information made public, leading in some cases to death threats and abuse, the force has said.\n\nPolice officers faced off with protesters, Aug. 25.

Sunny often can\u2019t sleep for worry that their daughter, in elementary school, might be targeted. She doesn\u2019t let her daughter run off to the park swings like she used to. Sunny says if their information were leaked, she would consider keeping her daughter at home from school.\n\n\u201cThere is so much sadness, so much hate among our community right now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be divided into two sides.\u201d Her husband declined to be interviewed.\n\nWhile protesters at the front lines of battles with police are mostly young, support of the opposition movement goes across generations. Public approval and trust of the government has dropped to record lows since China resumed sovereignty over the former British colony in 1997.\n\nThere are just over 2.6 million households in Hong Kong, official data shows. A rally on Aug. 18 drew an estimated 1.7 million people, almost a quarter of the city\u2019s 7.4 million people. One on June 16 drew 2 million.\n\nProtesters at an Aug. 18 rally.

Mrs. Chan says she is against violent protests as well as against police officers\u2019 use of force in arrests.\n\nThe two were so upset by a particularly brutal episode of violence they saw on TV one night, in which a mob attacked protesters, that they bumped into each other in the bathroom at 2 a.m., unable to sleep. They had a long, teary conversation right there.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to comfort her, because I don\u2019t know how to deal with this either,\u201d Mrs. Chan says.\n\nAfter a 13-year-old and 15-year-old were arrested on the way home from an outdoor political movie screening Thursday, a local juvenile court ordered them to be immediately removed from their families\u2019 care and placed in government care against the families\u2019 wishes, according to their legal representatives. The magistrate said their parents couldn\u2019t keep them in check, and a protection order was needed to keep them safe.\n\nEdith, a 59-year-old janitor and single mother, learned as she was getting ready for bed on July 28 that her youngest daughter, Charlie, had been detained at a demonstration.\n\nEdith worries about her daughter Charlie, who was arrested last month.

Friends watching the footage peppered Charlie\u2019s sister, Christine, with calls and WhatsApp messages. \u201cI think...your sister was just arrested,\u201d one read.\n\nChristine frantically called Charlie, but her phone had been confiscated by police. She hesitated to worry their mom, thinking Charlie might be released shortly. A few hours later, she called her mother.\n\nThe family spent the whole night calling around police stations. They didn\u2019t know it at the time, but in the course of her arrest Charlie had ticked a box instructing police not to alert her family for fear her mother would worry.\n\nProtesters return tear gas on Aug. 25.

By the time Charlie was allowed to make a phone call for legal assistance\u2014to the number she had written on her arm before the demonstration\u2014her family had found out where she was and arranged for representation.\n\nCharlie faces one of the most serious charges brought against protesters\u2014that of rioting, which carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years. The charges were first brought a day after Beijing publicly pressured Hong Kong authorities for tougher treatment to quell the uprising.\n\nCharlie\u2019s arrest has largely been a taboo topic at home. At dinners, Edith\u2019s daughters brush off her fears, telling her they can deal with a sentence when it comes, that maybe authorities will be lenient. When she is alone in her bedroom, Edith thinks of nothing else. She barely sleeps.\n\n\u201cShe had her whole future ahead of her,\u201d Edith said of Charlie, a university student who aspires to work in the arts. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to think what the future will be like for her now.\u201d\n\nA view of protesters from a tram, Aug. 28. Photo: ROMAN PILIPEY/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nPreviously someone who didn\u2019t pay much attention to politics, Edith has becoming increasingly incensed on how authorities have ignored the protesters\u2019 demands. She did eventually see the video of Charlie\u2019s arrest and was horrified by the rough way the police tackled her to the ground.\n\nIn an interview, sobbing for the first time in front of her daughters since Charlie\u2019s arrest, Edith questioned what she sees as the government\u2019s indifference. \u201cHow can they not understand? Why have they driven their kids to this?\u201d\n\nShare your thoughts How would you react if your child joined the protesters? Join the discussion below.\n\nJamie, an 18-year-old student, has had countless quarrels at home about her participation in the protests. She says her parents want to give her the freedom to do what she believes is right, but as the violence has escalated and the possible prison sentences have gone up, they are finding it harder to let her go.\n\nOn Aug. 11, a protester suffered a bad eye injury after being hit with some kind of projectile. Her face filled TV screens and blood soaked through her bandages as medics provided aid. Jamie\u2019s father, who has business in China and doesn\u2019t support the protests, asked, \u201cIf that was you, how could we go on?\u201d\n\nJamie has learned how to hide where she\u2019s going from her parents. She often discards her helmet and goggles before coming home and skips buying meals so she can afford new protective gear before the next clash.\n\nProtesters on Aug. 25. Photo: Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nOn Aug. 5, as the city saw some of the worst clashes yet, her parents told her to come home immediately or don\u2019t bother coming back. Jamie says she was determined to keep protesting, so stayed over with a friend.\n\nAt 3 a.m., her sister texted her. \u201cMom says come home,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPlease. She just wants to see you.\u201d\n\nShe went back. The next morning, her mother came in to her room to gather laundry, as she usually does.\n\n\u201cYou will do what you will do,\u201d Jamie says her mother, who doesn\u2019t have a strong political stance but has grown weary on how authorities have handled the unrest, told her. \u201cBut please, always remember that your father and I will always be worrying about your safety. We just want to know that you\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nWrite to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com", "description": "Public unrest over China\u2019s authority is taking a personal toll, worrying parents of the young protesters who are propelling the opposition movement and causing turmoil between generations.", "authors": ["Natasha Khan", "Natasha.Khan Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103291/social"}
