Maruti Suzuki To Launch Jimny SUV Soon", "language": "en", "text": "Maruti Suzuki was responsible for a widespread nostalgia recently when it announced its decision to discontinue the Gypsy. An iconic 2-door SUV for the Indians, Maruti Suzuki has now restricted its production for the Indian Army. There is, however, a ray of hope for the general public as well. Why? The company might be bringing its much sought after Jimny to India next.\n\nSuzuki first launched the Jimny in Japan last year. Cited by many as a very capable off-roader, anticipation for the SUV\u2019s global launch grew over time. Now, recent reports reveal that the company might be eyeing a new variant based on the Jimny Sierra for the Indian market.\n\nSuzuki Jimny (Image: Suzuki Global)\n\nAlso read: Harley Davidson LiveWire Electric Motorcycle Is Coming To India This Month\n\nAs per the reports, the Jimny variant will be an off-roader SUV customised to offer comfort for everyday commute. The variant to come to India will be a right hand drive version of the Jimny and might be produced indigenously in the country at Maruti Suzuki\u2019s Gujarat plant.\n\nThere are also speculations that the variant headed to India will be a five-door version of the three-door model that is currently sold. If so, the car will naturally have a longer wheelbase than the existing model.\n\nDon't Miss 126 SHARES 264 SHARES 464 SHARES 175 SHARES 145 SHARES\n\nSuzuki Jimny (Image: Suzuki Global)\n\nAlso read: Kia Seltos Drive Experience: A New-Age Compact SUV Ruler After Hyundai Creta?\n\nFrom what can be deduced by the available engine options of the Jimny, India might get the naturally aspirated 1.5-litre four-cylinder K-Series petrol engine, which is also sold in other parts of the world. In India, Suzuki already uses the engine to power Ertiga and Ciaz.\n\nIf and when Suzuki decides to bring the Jimny to India, the SUV will again be a mammoth to beat in its class. Gypsy has ruled the off-roading SUV segment in India for decades altogether. With an engine delivering more power and a built that offers comfort features in addition to an off-roading capability will certainly be considerable upgrade over the Gypsy. So all those who miss the Gypsy, you may wait for its big brother next!", "description": "After discontinuing its much acclaimed Gypsy in India, Maruti Suzuki now seems poised to bring its Jimny into the country soon as its first SUV offering after 35 years.
