Watson took the snap and quickly stepped up as the pocket began to collapse around him under the pressure of the Raiders pass rush.\n\nWhile it looked that Watson was ready to go down, he instead spun out of the would-be tackle, adjusted his helmet, and threw to the end zone, where tight end Darren Fells made a marvelous catch to put the Texans up for good.\n\nReplays showed that Watson hadn't simply escaped the Raiders attack, but he had even fought through getting kicked in the eye.\n\nAs Watson spun out of his first defender, the foot of defensive end Arden Key caught him right through his facemask. But rather than give up on the play, Watson carried on and was able to connect with Fells for the winning score.\n\nAfter the play, Watson was treated on the field for some time as doctors came to check on his eye, but he eventually walked off the field on his own and later re-entered the game to take the final snaps as the Texans wound the clock down to zero.\n\nWatson finished the day with 279 yards and three touchdowns, none more impressive than his game-winner.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers were robbed of potential game-winning touchdown by a premature whistle\n\nLos Angeles Rams completed a brilliant double-reverse flea-flicker that confounded the Bengals for a 65-yard touchdown\n\nBill Belichick would fly coach and put veteran players in first class, and one former Patriot said it was a huge factor in how players judge head coaches\n\nBill Belichick couldn't help but smile after using an ingenious loophole to burn the clock 'without really having to do anything'", "description": "Not even a kick to the face could stop Deshaun Watson in the second half as he led the Houston Texans to a comeback win.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db62630dee0197243242533?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
