So when the cars brake, they get a little more energy, and then, when they accelerate it gives them a little boost.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe boost is about 150 horsepower, the equivalent of adding the pep of a 2015 Volkswagen Golf. Gasoline-powered IndyCars have about 750 horsepower, but the gas-electric models will have 900 horsepower.\n\n\u201cThat's the idea here: to make the cars even better performers and a little more efficient and more relevant to the street cars.\u201d - Gary Gastelu, Fox News automotive editor\n\nHybrid cars are also projected to generate higher performance in automotive sales. The relevance of electric cars in the market today, and its introduction to NASCAR is reportedly sparking the interest of top auto leaders.\n\nToyota \"said they're excited about this idea because they sell a lot of hybrids,\u201d Gastelu said. \u201cFord, which races a Mustang in NASCAR, has a hybrid performance Mustang coming out around 2021, 2022. So it makes a lot of sense if the idea is to make the racing better and also make the cars more relevant to what you have in showrooms.\u201d\n\nFor now, hybrid integration is a slow bleed, but there\u2019s a chance NASCAR will go full-electric in the eventual future.\n\n\u201cThe first ones will probably only be used on the short tracks and the road courses where there's a lot of breaking,\u201d Gastelu said. \u201cTalladega, Daytona might use the regular V8s for a while but eventually, they say, they want to go full electric.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThat's something that's interesting because Chevrolet is giving up hybrids,\u201d Gastelu said. \u201cThey're jumping to a full electric lineup. They're not even working on hybrids right now. So I'm interested to see how they're going to react to this.\u201d", "description": "Hybrid cars are going to make an appearance in NASCAR come 2022.", "authors": ["Angelica Stabile"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP19279809768435.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
