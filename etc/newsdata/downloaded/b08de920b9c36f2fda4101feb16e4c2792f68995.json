That is because the cost basis has been \u201cstepped up\u201d from the price the deceased owner originally paid for it to its fair-market value on the date it was inherited.\n\nEliminating the loophole is not a new idea. In fact, it was proposed by the Obama administration in 2015, with some exceptions designed to protect the middle class \u2013 including for the inheritance of small, family-owned and operated businesses, for example.\n\nObama referred to the provision as \u201cthe single largest capital gains tax loophole\u201d and closing it would \u201censure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share on inherited assets.\u201d\n\nUsing similar language, Biden said his funding proposals would make sure \u201cthe super-wealthy pay their fair share.\u201d\n\nThe proposal itself could damage the economy, acting as a double-tax on assets at death, Chris Edwards, director of tax policy at libertarian-leaning think tank the Cato Institute, told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to eliminate step-up in basis for capital gains at death while we retain a death (estate) tax,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cMany other countries either tax capital gains at death with a low rate or they have a separate death tax, but not both.\u201d\n\nIn addition to eliminating the stepped-up basis provision, Biden also proposed capping the itemized deductions the wealthiest Americans can take to 28 percent to pay for his plan.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe 2020 candidate has taken flak from his rivals for supporting Obama\u2019s legacy when it suits him.\n\nIn the September Democratic debate, Juli\u00e1n Castro accused Biden of wanting to \u201ctake credit for Obama\u2019s work without having to answer any questions.\u201d\n\nDuring the same debate, Biden shrugged off questions about deportations under the Obama administration by saying he stands \u201cwith Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad, indifferent.\u201d\n\nWhile other candidates have moved toward more progressive health care policies \u2013 like Medicare-for-all \u2013 Biden has also stuck to modifying the ObamaCare model.\n\nIn July, Biden said he is not relying on Obama as a \u201ccrutch.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The 2020 candidate has taken flak from his rivals for supporting President Obama\u2019s legacy when it suits him.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/Joe-Biden-grab.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
