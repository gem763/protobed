Kicking off our coverage, which will run online over the next seven days, is Ben Bloom's exclusive interview with Liz McColgan-Nuttall\u200b on how she juggled a successful return with a toddler in tow.\n\nIt is funny, every time Liz McColgan-Nuttall hears the latest topical issue in women\u2019s sport, she has a feeling of having been there before.\n\nA victim of merciless sponsors dropping female athletes when they become pregnant? She experienced that. Frowned upon by \u201cexperts\u201d for behaving in a way unbefitting a woman? That as well. Proof that motherhood need not be the end of a sporting career by returning to global success after childbirth? She did that.\n\nThree decades before sportswomen were belatedly given a voice to shine a light on issues and injustices affecting female athletes worldwide, McColgan-Nuttall (or McColgan, as she was known during her competitive days) went through all those things alone. She had no choice.\n\nShe alleges that Nike decided to drop her the moment she told them she was pregnant in 1990. She was an Olympic 10,000m silver medallist, a world indoor 3,000m silver medallist and a double Commonwealth 10,000m champion. To put it simply, she was within touching distance of being the world\u2019s best female distance runner. Yet, she says she was written off in an instant, aged 25.", "description": "This month's Women's Sport 12-page supplement is the Motherhood Issue and will be available in print in Thursday's paper.", "authors": ["Ben Bloom", "Athletics Correspondent", "Jim White", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000212492812-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
