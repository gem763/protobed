Since taking over in April after Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s ouster, McAleenan has delivered on the one thing that has mattered most to Trump: The monthly border arrest numbers that gauge migration flows have plunged by two-thirds. An array of new physical and administrative barriers are going up. The migration crisis that was potentially a major liability to Trump\u2019s reelection bid has abated, at least for now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat McAleenan would lead this turnaround has been something of a surprise to the immigration hard-liners who had labeled him a Democrat and an \u201cObama guy\u201d with dubious allegiance to the White House\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nYet McAleenan, 48, remains mostly an outsider in Trump world. The president has yet to nominate him for the DHS secretary position, and McAleenan\u2019s future in the administration looks more and more tenuous, especially as political rivals try to elbow him aside.\n\nAlthough he has clashed with some administration officials and other DHS leaders, McAleenan has embraced, implemented or crafted many of the administration\u2019s other controversial immigration policies, measures that immigrant advocates say have endangered migrant families and shut the door to those fleeing persecution. McAleenan said he views the moves as justified in response to a record influx of families at the border that led to nearly 1 million arrests during the 2019 fiscal year that ended Monday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMomentary border reprieve rests on a rickety foundation as U.S. immigration policies are put to the test\n\nWhite House officials declined to discuss why McAleenan has not been nominated despite expectations that he would be confirmed, and they also declined to address his frustrations, offering only praise for his work.\n\n\u201cSecretary McAleenan is doing a fantastic job implementing the president\u2019s plan to secure the southern border, build the wall, halt illegal immigration and stop the dangerous practice of catch-and-release,\u201d said deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley. \u201cThanks to the changes President Trump\u2019s administration has put in place, now, if you try to violate our borders, you will be turned around and sent back to where you came from.\u201d\n\nMcAleenan also has pleased Trump by speeding up construction on hundreds of miles of steel barriers across the desert, defending the president\u2019s \u201cborder wall\u201d as a major tactical benefit.\n\nAs a career law enforcement official who signed up after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, McAleenan views the growing politicization of DHS with unease.\n\n'Words matter'\n\nMorgan was removed as Border Patrol chief at the beginning of the Trump administration, and when the president brought him back as acting ICE director in May, he clashed with McAleenan almost immediately.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMorgan was eager to go forward with a mass roundup of Central American parents and children \u2014 the ICE \u201cfamily operation\u201d \u2014 but McAleenan stood in the way, arguing that it risked separating children from parents and provoking Democrats ahead of a crucial congressional vote on a $4.6 billion emergency aid package for the border.\n\nBefore Trump\u2019s purge at DHS, top officials challenged plan for mass family arrests\n\nMcAleenan prevailed, and the bill passed with bipartisan support, dividing Democrats. But hard-liners accused McAleenan of leaking details of the ICE operation to scuttle it. Brandon Judd, the powerful head of the Border Patrol union who has been an informal adviser to the president, blasted McAleenan as incompetent and \u201canti-Trump\u201d in a Fox News op-ed.\n\nWith McAleenan weakened, Morgan was named acting commissioner of CBP, and McAleenan\u2019s handpicked ally for that job, John Sanders, was forced out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump also brought in Cuccinelli, the conservative activist and former Virginia attorney general, to run USCIS. Unlike \u00adMcAleenan, Cuccinelli is a natural politician who is at ease in front of television cameras.\n\nCuccinelli has emerged as a de facto spokesman for DHS, making appearances on cable news, sparring with reporters and weighing in on border developments even when they are beyond his agency\u2019s purview. On Twitter, he is whimsical and provocative, posting selfies, dog pictures and musings on immigration.\n\nWhile he and others embrace the White House\u2019s rhetoric on immigration, McAleenan distances himself from it, at the risk of appearing insufficiently committed to the president.\n\nAD\n\nMcAleenan avoids the term \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d speaking instead of \u201cmigrants\u201d and \u201cvulnerable families.\u201d Though \u201calien\u201d is a U.S. legal term, McAleenan said the way people hear it carries \u201cpolitical, emotional and racial\u201d overtones.\n\n\u201cI think the words matter a lot,\u201d McAleenan said. \u201cIf you alienate half of your audience by your use of your terminology, it\u2019s going to hamper your ability to ever win an argument.\u201d\n\n'The Trump train'\n\nSince DHS was created in the aftermath of 9/11, successive U.S. presidents have placed a priority on having a Senate-confirmed leader running the bureaucratic juggernaut, which has 240,000 employees and a $50 billion annual budget. Trump has said he prefers keeping top officials in an \u201cacting\u201d capacity, retaining more flexibility to remove them. \u00adMcAleenan has now been in the acting role for longer than any other chief in the department\u2019s history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRaised in Los Angeles, where his father taught sociology at Occidental College, McAleenan attended Amherst College in Massachusetts and law school at the University of Chicago. He took a course on race and law from a young faculty member, Barack Obama, and McAleenan would later donate to his presidential campaign.\n\nMcAleenan said he wanted to join the FBI well before 9/11 cemented his determination. Instead, he was recruited to the former U.S. Customs Service to establish an anti-terrorism office as the agency merged with the U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nMcAleenan rose through the ranks of the new CBP, leading travel safety and screening programs, and by age 35 he was the port director in charge of security at Los Angeles International Airport and 17 others.\n\nAD\n\nHe was the No. 2 official at CBP during Obama\u2019s second term as president, and after Trump\u2019s win, \u00adMcAleenan was an obvious choice for commissioner, despite his reputation as a Democrat.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNobody has that depth of expertise,\u201d said Ronald Vitiello, the former Border Patrol chief and former acting ICE director who was removed during a purge at DHS this spring. There are few other DHS leaders who have been around since the department\u2019s creation and possess the same level of institutional knowledge, he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a liability if he\u2019s not around,\u201d Vitiello said in an interview, arguing that the administration had been \u201csucceeding on every level without the help of Congress\u201d at the border.\n\nMcAleenan was confirmed as CBP commissioner in March 2018 in a 77-to-19 vote that reflected his standing with both parties. That standing has remained relatively intact despite several bruising appearances on Capitol Hill \u2014 some lawmakers who torch the administration during homeland security hearings have told him publicly they still regard him as a moderating influence in the administration.\n\nLast month, McAleenan gave a counterterrorism speech that included some of the administration\u2019s strongest statements yet that domestic hate groups and white nationalism are a growing security threat.\n\nAD\n\nMcAleenan also blocked an attempt by Cuccinelli and others to end a humanitarian program that gives USCIS authorities the ability to defer the deportation of immigrants undergoing medical treatment they would not be able to receive in their home countries. Hard-liners were befuddled by a Trump administration decision to extend \u2014 instead of eliminate \u2014 a program benefiting immigrants who lack lawful status.\n\nMark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank with restrictionist views that have had a major influence in the White House, said McAleenan deserves credit for \u201cputting out the fire du jour at the border.\u201d But he said McAleenan remains a poor fit to lead DHS.\n\n\u201cThe DHS secretary should be somebody who is completely part of the team, and while McAleenan is not some guerrilla fighter of the resistance, he\u2019s not really totally on board the Trump train,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should be the case if you\u2019re a Cabinet secretary dealing with one of the most important issues politically for the administration.\u201d\n\n'Went too far'\n\nAt a hearing on Capitol Hill in July, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) blasted McAleenan as \u201cone of the key architects of the Trump administration\u2019s child separation policy.\u201d The label stung, in part, because it was true.\n\nWhen McAleenan was the deputy commissioner of CBP under Obama, the idea of separating children from parents was locked in a drawer, a policy option considered too opprobrious and unpalatable, even if seen as a potentially effective deterrent.\n\nThe idea resurfaced under Trump, coming to the forefront in the fall of 2017 when the number of migrant families arriving with children was rising. White House officials including Stephen Miller were calling for drastic measures, along with then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and others at the Justice Department.\n\nMcAleenan took a lead role in writing the memo for Nielsen, along with then-ICE Director Tom Homan, recommending she adopt the \u201czero tolerance\u201d prosecution strategy.\n\nThe decision has gnawed at him, and to date he is among the only administration officials who speak about the policy with remorse. Others continue to defend the separations, including Trump, and say the policy might have prevented the surge at the border that followed if the president had not given in to public pressure and ordered an end to the separations in June 2018.\n\nMcAleenan said the separations \u201cwent too far.\u201d\n\n\u201cZero tolerance\u201d was \u201cwell intended,\u201d he argued, because he and other administration officials who backed it saw a moral imperative in stopping smuggling networks from bringing families and children on dangerous trips to the border.\n\n\u201cHow can we let these smugglers victimize these desperate families?\u201d he said, describing his thinking at the time. \u201cHow can we let this flow continue to grow, with more people being victims and more kids dying on this journey, and not do everything in our power to try to stop it?\u201d\n\nMcAleenan said he balanced that across what he expected would be a \u201cvery short-term impact of prosecuting that parent, with full intent to reunite that parent and child,\u201d acknowledging now that it was a miscalculation.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the impact in the six-week period on 2,500-or-so families and understand the emotional pain for those children, it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the one part of this whole thing that I couldn\u2019t ever be part of again.\u201d\n\nNation of immigrants\n\nThe Democratic primary race has demonstrated the degree to which the immigration debate has shifted under Trump. The leading candidates have outlined proposals to freeze deportations, extend health-care benefits to immigrants living in the country illegally and decriminalize the act of crossing the border unlawfully, while blasting Obama-era enforcement as overkill.\n\nSuch proposals are anathema to McAleenan, who points out that then-Sens. Barack Obama (Ill.), and Hillary Clinton (N.Y.), along with Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) joined other Democrats in voting for the 2006 Secure Fence Act to fund hundreds of miles of barrier along the Mexico border.\n\nMcAleenan traveled to Europe during and after the migration backlash and said he came away with an awareness of the risks of too much immigration, too fast.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a system where generous countries of goodwill are not going to be overwhelmed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a nation of immigrants. We absolutely need the energy that diverse peoples bring to our economy and our society.\u201d\n\nMcAleenan defends some of the controversial policies he has implemented on the grounds that Democrats have dug in too deep against Trump. \u201cPreviously balanced elements of our political apparatus have overreacted to the president in such a way that they\u2019re equally or more of the problem,\u201d he said, citing Democratic insistence for months that the border crisis was \u201cmanufactured\u201d despite his urgent warnings and pleas for help.\n\nGil Kerlikowske, who ran CBP during Obama\u2019s second term, credited McAleenan with \u201cbringing a level of order to DHS\u201d and said a \u201cgreat deal of fault\u201d rests with Democrats. \u201cWhen CBP was telling them this months and months ago before the end of last year, they said, \u2018It\u2019s not as bad as it was in 2000.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMcAleenan makes a similar argument about the necessity of agreements with Mexico and Central America that have made it significantly more difficult for asylum seekers to gain entry into the United States. McAleenan also credits Trump with \u201cchanging the dynamic\u201d by threatening Mexico with tariffs at the low point for CBP, when 5,000 migrants were streaming across the border each day.\n\n\u201cThe key change was actually provided by the president,\u201d McAleenan said.\n\nTrump\u2019s threats brought Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard rushing to Washington to change the president\u2019s mind. At a key meeting, when the moment came for the administration to tell Mexico what the United States wanted, senior U.S. officials turned to McAleenan.\n\nMcAleenan has repeatedly traveled to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, spending far more time there than the secretary of state, advancing his signature policy initiative \u2014 bilateral \u201casylum cooperation agreements\u201d that will give the United States the ability to reroute migrants who arrive at the U.S. border to Central America.\n\nThe trips have made McAleenan a front-page public figure in Central American capitals, helped by the fact that he speaks some Spanish and that his wife, Corina, who also grew up in Los Angeles, is originally from El Salvador.\n\nThe asylum agreements have yet to be implemented, but critics have denounced them for threatening to send asylum seekers to some of the very nations they are fleeing, where murder rates are among the highest in the world. McAleenan sees the accords as an alternative to the president\u2019s previous impulse to cut off the region entirely and argues they will set the stage for a much broader development effort to address the root causes of migration.\n\n'We are apolitical'\n\nAsked whether he still considers himself a Democrat, McAleenan demurred.\n\n\u201cWe are apolitical,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you privately register as or what you\u2019ve donated as have no bearing on how you conduct yourself in professional capacity.\u201d\n\nLast month at a Coast Guard hangar in San Diego, McAleenan and Morgan addressed a group of Border Patrol agents, CBP officers and Coast Guard personnel while waiting for Air Force One to arrive and bring Trump to visit new spans of the border fence.\n\nA young Coast Guard member asked the men what brought them \u201cjoy\u201d in their jobs. McAleenan told the group about meeting a 49-year CBP veteran who was preparing to retire next month, and the sweeping changes and improvements he had witnessed in his career.\n\nMorgan told the group he liked \u201cdoing hits\u201d on radio and TV and \u201cpunching back\u201d at Trump\u2019s critics, mentioning his appearance the day before on the show of right-wing agitator Sebastian Gorka.\n\nTrump tours border barrier as part of a show of force on immigration\n\nWhen Morgan finished, \u00adMcAleenan reminded the group that their duties to uphold the law transcend politics: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is in the White House \u2014 Bush, or Obama, or Trump \u2014 you guys all know that our job remains the same.\u201d\n\nThe president landed soon after, and McAleenan and Morgan met him along a dusty span of the towering, brand-new fence. McAleenan, along with former DHS secretaries John F. Kelly and Nielsen, are among the \u201cexperts\u201d the president said convinced him the barrier did not need to extend the full length of the border, and should be steel and see-through, not concrete.\n\nTrump praised the structure\u2019s technical properties at length, and Morgan periodically jumped in. At one point, Morgan demonstrated his loyalty, jabbing at the air and insisting the barrier was not the president\u2019s \u201cvanity wall.\u201d Trump flashed a proud smile at reporters.", "description": "In an era of polarized immigration politics, Kevin McAleenan navigates the lonely center as he runs the Department of Homeland Security in an acting role, with no nomination in sight.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SPSwKZLF4FwfH5JvHr2LAA0QwB8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VESSDUFH7QI6TBZTJDEHENPTSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
