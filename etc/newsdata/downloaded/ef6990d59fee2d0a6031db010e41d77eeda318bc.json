At least for now. Remove the scapegoat from the team and Emery might find he has no protection from the abuse.\n\nArsenal defender Sokratis reacts after his late goal was controversially ruled out by Martin Atkinson after VAR review\n\nThe Greece international slammed into the net on 83 minutes after Palace failed to clear yet another corner\n\nJordan Ayew celebrates with Cheikou Kouyate (centre) after scoring Crystal Palace's second goal and equaliser\n\nAyew heads in from close range as he connects with James McArthur's chipped cross to the back post\n\nMATCH FACTS, PLAYER RATINGS AND MATCH ZONE ARSENAL (4-2-3-1): Leno 6; Chambers 5, Sokratis 7, Luiz 6, Tierney 6 (Kolasinac 75, 6); Guendouzi 6, Xhaka 6 (Saka 61, 6); Pepe 7, Lacazette 6, Ceballos 6; Aubameyang 5.5 Goalscorers: Sokratis 7, Luiz 9 Booked: Chambers, Guendouzi, Subs not used: Martinez, Bellerin, Holding, Torreira, Martinelli Manager: Unai Emery 6 CRYSTAL PALACE (4-3-3): Hennessey 5.5; Ward 6, Tomkins 6, Cahill 6, Van Aanholt 6.5; Kouyate 6 (McCarthy 90+4), Milijoevic 7, McArthur 7; Townsend 6.5, Ayew 7 (Benteke 81), Zaha 7.5.

Besides, they know he's one-paced. It's one of the main criticisms.\n\nEmery shuffled across to offer him a supportive handshake, Xhaka gave it a low-five slap, tore off his shirt and offered a four-letter parting shot at the crowd before he disappeared towards the dressing room.\n\nSokratis celebrates with after giving Arsenal a one-goal advantage against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium\n\nThe central defender hammered in at the near post after Wayne Hennessey misjudged Nicolas Pepe's corner\n\nHe had not performed especially poorly and even helped set up the opening goal for Sokratis but that was in the seventh minute so much had happened since.\n\nThe mood inside had turned and it turned again when Sokratis found the net in the 83rd minute only to find it ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR) after a long delay.\n\nNot for the first time, Crystal Palace failed to clear a corner, there was a scramble, a tussle between Calum Chambers and Luka Milivojevic and the ball spilled to Sokratis who slammed in what he thought was his second of the game.\n\nArsenal celebrated hard and the ball was on the centre spot with both teams lining up to restart when it became clear the goal was under scrutiny. Eventually, referee Martin Atkinson was advised to reverse his decision.\n\nEven after watching several replays it was hard to find anything 'clear and obvious'. There might have been a foul by Chambers. Equally, there might have been a foul by Milivojevic. There was a lot of grappling going on.\n\nThe Brazilian snaffled his second goal in Arsenal colours after Alexandre Lacazette flicked on at the front post\n\nDavid Luiz celebrates after doubling Arsenal's lead, poking in from another Nicolas Pepe set piece\n\nThis was the second crucial and controversial intervention by VAR Jarred Gillett. Palace's fight-back was triggered by a penalty for a foul by Chambers on Wilf Zaha which had initially been ruled as a dive by Atkinson who flashed a yellow card.\n\nReplays, however, showed Chambers did not win the ball. He stuck out a leg, planted his foot and Zaha went over it, albeit in extravagant fashion. Atkinson accepted Gillett's advice, changed his decision and Milivojevic proved as reliable as ever from the spot.\n\nAnxiety seeped back into Arsenal's football. Bernd Leno saved from Patrick van Aanholt and was beaten by Jordan Ayew early in the second half.\n\nJames McArthur darted into the space behind Chambers, side-stepped Xhaka and clipped a cross to the back post. David Luiz had been drawn under the ball and Ayew was left with the relatively simple task of nodding it down as the 'keeper flung his body across the line in desperation.\n\nCrystal Palace were awarded a penalty on 32 minutes after Wilfried Zaha was brought down by Calum Chambers\n\nEagles captain Luka Milivojevic sends Gunners stopper Bernd Leno the wrong way from 12 yards to half the deficit\n\nAll square and an impressive opening burst by Emery's team was long forgotten. If only their central defenders had proved as adept at keeping the ball out as they were yesterday(SUN) at sticking it the net at the other end.\n\nArsenal went ahead when Palace 'keeper Wayne Hennessey misjudged a corner and Gary Cahill failed to clear. Xhaka nodded it to Sokratis who volleyed through a crowd and into the net, his first goal of the season.\n\nLuiz made it 2-0, two minutes later, from a corner on the same side, expertly delivered by Nicolas Pepe. Alexandre Lacazette flicked it on and Luiz nudged it over the line as Palace froze.\n\nThat, in theory, ought to have been that. The visitors would be forced to venture out in search of goals and show more adventure, take more risks and Arsenal's strikers would revel in the space this created.\n\nArsenal captain Granit Xhaka gestures towards the crowd at the Emirates Stadium as he is substituted\n\nThe Swiss midfielder removes his shirt and walks down the tunnel as home supporters cheer his departure\n\nBut Roy Hodgson's team relish a chance to defy the odds. They fought back, levelled and defended with spirit. Hennessey made saves, perhaps the best of them to deny Luiz, and they rode their luck with the VAR and left with a point.\n\nThere were fleeting moments when Palace thought they might even sneak a winner. Mayhem erupted when Zaha broke out of defence only to be abruptly halted by a rugby tackle from Matteo Guendouzi.\n\nPlayers from both sides pushed and shoved, emotions were strained by this stage and there was an unhappy reaction from Ayew when he was replaced by Christian Benteke.\n\nAyew shook his head and muttered to himself in disbelief but it was by some distance only the second most interesting substitution on a breathless day of strange goings-on.", "description": "MATT BARLOW AT THE EMIRATES STADIUM: An hour had passed and Arsenal had already thrown away their two-goal lead when Granit Xhaka's number went up and the home crowd roared.", "authors": ["Matt Barlow For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/18/20251940-0-image-a-31_1572201347782.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
