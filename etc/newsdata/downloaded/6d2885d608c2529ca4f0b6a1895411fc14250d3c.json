If anything, she\u2019s encouraging us to live vicariously through her.\n\nIsn\u2019t that sweet?\n\nThe Rise And Shine hitmaker took to social media over the weekend as she celebrated big sister Kim Kardashian\u2019s 39th birthday to troll us all, sorry, we mean, fill us in on her poolside antics.\n\nDonning a pair of swimmers, the mother-of-one sat by the glistening waters with a mountainous vista framing the shot.\n\nWith not a care in the world, she asked someone to take a tOtAlLy CaNdId shot, as she ever so naturally tipped her body forward and stuck her booty out while lounging on a sun chair.\n\nWe believe this is her \u2018can you put sunscreen on my back\u2019 pose.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019re getting sidetracked.\n\nIn the two shots, she captioned them: \u2018Getaway\u2019 and \u2018Girls trip\u2019, giving us an in-depth breakdown of what she was up to.\n\nOver the weekend Kim gave fans a sneak peek into her celebrations with a glimpse at her pre-party makeup, the extravagantly-decorated dinner and the after-party fun\n\nIt all kicked off on Kim\u2019s stories on Saturday as she let us know little sister Kylie was doing her makeup, which made sense seeing as Ky has made bajillions from her cosmetics empire.\n\nKy did Kim\u2019s makeup (Picture: Kim Kardashian / Instagram)\n\nKim\u2019s birthday went off (Picture: Instagram/kimkardashian)\n\nThe shindig was held at Kris Jenner\u2019s sprawling seven-bedroom home in La Quinta, near Palm Springs, and appropriately dubbed \u2018Kim day\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star showed us the table adorned with a whole heap of party accoutrements to make it special for those toasting. From party hats to sunglasses, necklaces and confetti, it was the birthday of dreams.\n\nShowing everyone who the real megastar was, Kim\u2019s party hat read \u2018birthday princess\u2019 and rightly so, taking pride of place next to a necklace that sported \u2018birthday babe\u2019 and a broach that let everyone know \u2018today is all about you\u2019.\n\nAlright, Kim, we get it \u2013 today is your day.\n\nNumerous peach balloons sat in bundles on the table with pink streamers fitting in the colour theme of the evening.\n\nFrom the party to the pool, this family works hard and plays ever harder.\n\nWe\u2019re not jealous. Not jealous at all.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
