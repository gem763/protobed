NBA Commissioner Adam Silver attends the pre-match news conference. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - NBA commissioner Adam Silver defended the league\u2019s response to the Houston Rockets general manager\u2019s tweet backing Hong Kong democracy protests, telling Japan\u2019s Kyodo News that his organization supports freedom of expression without necessarily endorsing a point of view.\n\nDaryl Morey apologized on Monday for any hurt caused by the tweet that he quickly deleted over the weekend, but his support for the protests in the Chinese-ruled city angered Beijing, Chinese fans and the team\u2019s partners in a key NBA market.\n\nThe National Basketball Association issued a statement saying it regretted Morey\u2019s remarks, rankling U.S. lawmakers, who accused the league of buckling under Chinese pressure for the sake of business.\n\nIt also disappointed some who see the NBA as the most progressive U.S. sports league. Silver has urged players to speak out on issues of concern, including questions of police brutality and gun violence.\n\nBut Silver told Kyodo News in an interview the league\u2019s stance was firm that members of the NBA community were free to express themselves and that the league backed their right to do so.\n\n\u201cThere are the values that have been part of this league from its earliest days, and that includes free expression,\u201d Silver, in Japan for a preseason game on Tuesday between the Rockets and the Toronto Raptors, told Kyodo.\n\n\u201cI think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d he told the news agency. \u201cI accept that it is also Chinese governments\u2019 and Chinese businesses\u2019 right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues.\u201d\n\nSilver said the league also supported Brooklyn Nets owner and Alibaba Group (BABA.N) co-founder Joseph Tsai, who issued a lengthy statement criticizing Morey\u2019s tweet.", "description": "NBA commissioner Adam Silver defended the league's response to the Houston Rockets general manager's tweet backing Hong Kong democracy protests, telling Japan's Kyodo News that his organization supports freedom of expression without necessarily endorsing a point of view.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438270789&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9703S", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
