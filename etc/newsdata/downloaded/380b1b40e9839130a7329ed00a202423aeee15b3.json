NYC is devastated, he\u2019s coming home!\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe jibe from the president came just after de Blasio\u2019s appearance on the set of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d where he made public his plans to exit the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cI feel like I've contributed all I can to this primary election, and it's clearly not my time,\u201d he said, citing his inability to qualify for the party\u2019s primary debates as the \u201ccentral reason\u201d behind his decision.\n\nDespite the bloated nature of the 2020 Democratic field, Trump and his family have shown a special fondness in recent months for taking aim at de Blasio, the top public official in the president\u2019s hometown.\n\nHours after de Blasio first declared his presidential candidacy in May, Trump weighed in on Twitter with an insult for his fellow New Yorker.\n\n\u201cThe Dems are getting another beauty to join their group,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cBill de Blasio of NYC, considered the worst mayor in the U.S., will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes & crime, he\u2019s your man. NYC HATES HIM!\u201d\n\nBut de Blasio, who called the president a \u201cbully\u201d in his campaign announcement video, had seemingly relished the attention from his would-be general election opponent, previously bragging that he irritates Trump in a way that sets him apart from the rest of the Democratic field.\n\n\u201cI know something about Donald Trump that\u2019s different from the other candidates because I watched him for decades,\u201d de Blasio told CNN in May, adding: \u201cI understand his game plan. I understand his tricks and his strategies, and I do get under his skin.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between the two New Yorkers has not always been so acrimonious. As a private citizen, Trump predicted ahead of de Blasio\u2019s election to City Hall in 2013 that \u201che\u2019ll end up being a good mayor.\u201d\n\nBut de Blasio\u2019s stewardship of New York City has since become a subject of consistent ridicule from the president's allies and conservative media commentators.", "description": "\u201cOh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years!\u201d Trump wrote online.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0c/7f/c2637a6f4b0aa335826bed58c8ea/190920-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
