Favorable weather conditions on Monday allowed firefighters to contain some of the fire, which has now burned over 74,000 acres.\n\nResidents are growing frustrated at PG&E, the country\u2019s largest electricity supplier, which announced that its next blackout will start early Tuesday and affect 605,000 customers \u2014 about 1.5 million people \u2014 in 29 Northern California counties.\n\n\u201cPG&E can\u2019t figure out how to deliver power reliably without killing people,\u201d Petaluma resident Scotty Richardson, who runs a business from his home, told AP. \u201cThis is more than three strikes \u2014 it\u2019s a failure of epic proportions.\u201d\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January after facing hundreds of lawsuits from victims of the 2017 and 2018 wildfires, and now residents say the blackouts are driven by a fear of further legal action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so obvious it\u2019s just to protect them from more liability,\u201d Janet Luoma, a Santa Rosa resident, told AP.\n\nThe announcement came before the previous blackout, which hit 2.5 million customers, had ended. For many customers, power went out on Saturday, and it is unclear when it will be restored \u2014 before it is switched off again.\n\nREAD: PG&E execs were literally partying in wine country while planning to cut power to millions of Californians\n\nThe Kincade fire began last Wednesday, seven minutes after a nearby power line was damaged, though PG&E has yet to confirm if the power glitch started the blaze.\n\nThe blaze has destroyed 123 structures so far, 57 of which are homes, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection representative Jonathan Cox said at a press conference on Tuesday evening. He added that 90,000 buildings remain at risk.\n\nREAD: Hurricane-force winds are turning California's fires into a horror show\n\nIn the state\u2019s south, another major fire broke out near the Getty Center, the arts campus that includes the J. Paul Getty Museum, in Los Angeles in the early hours of Monday morning. Thousands of residents in the wealthy Brentwood neighborhood have been forced to evacuate, including celebrities like LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n\n\nThe Getty Fire had burned over 600 acres, and was only 5 percent contained by Monday evening, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. At least eight homes were destroyed, Mayor Eric Garcetti told a press conference.\n\nFire Chief Ralph Terrazas told reporters firefighters were overwhelmed. \u201cThey had to make some tough decisions on which houses they were able to protect,\" Terrazas said. \u201cMany times it depends upon where the ember lands.\u201d\n\nCover: A helicopter prepares to drop water onto a burning ridge top as a wildfire called the Getty fire burns on Mandeville Canyon Monday, Oct. 28, 2019, in Los Angeles.
