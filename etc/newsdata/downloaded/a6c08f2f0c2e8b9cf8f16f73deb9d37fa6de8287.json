Here is some of the daily decision-making | Paul Chadwick", "language": "en", "text": "In the life of every publication there is a rhythm. For readers it is felt when the fresh edition arrives, and is quiet until the next one. But for those who produce the publication, the beat is incessant. To help convey to readers something of the pulse rate inside a major journalism organisation, I asked two editors to describe their typical week, day by day.\n\nMelissa Denes edits Weekend, the magazine accompanying your Saturday Guardian, and Harriet Green edits the Observer Magazine, which arrives with that paper on Sundays. As they gave me their finished accounts, both independently remarked on how exhausting it was to think about and chronicle all their weekly processes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018[We] often work LA time if we are dealing with Hollywood stars.\u2019 Rosamund Pike on the cover of the 3 February 2019 Observer Magazine Photograph: The Observer\n\nThe two magazines are produced by separate teams, but their operations are sufficiently similar for the editors\u2019 descriptions to be blended here for brevity. My aim is to give readers an appreciation of the disciplined planning, attuned creativity and sustained endeavour required to produce magazines of such consistent quality. In what follows, bear in mind that the editors need to have eyes for both the printed and digital versions, which inhabit very different reading and advertising environments.\n\nWhile you are reading a newly published magazine, the editors are monitoring responses to it on social media, reacting to queries, making tweaks online and assessing their competitors\u2019 offerings. Already their next issue is deep in preparation, with the next two or three or more under way. They have a rough idea of covers for the next two or three months \u2013 recognising, always, that news is dynamic so they have to be agile.\n\nThe combinations of content in each issue receive careful thought. Denes aims to give readers \u201ca satisfying mix\u201d including great writing, strong covers, \u201clifestyle content that is useful and relevant\u201d, and surprises. For Green \u201ca typical shape is a celebrity interview, a more chewy reported piece \u2013 the rise of vaping, perhaps \u2013 plus something first person or zeitgeisty\u201d, and then the regular columns covering food, gardens, travel, beauty, relationship advice and more.\n\nBoth editors are involved in details, especially covers. Early in her week Denes is \u201creading through all the pages ... unpicking any clashes, getting back to editors, writers, designers if I think something needs more work \u2013 a better picture, a stronger headline, another edit\u201d.\n\nHow Paul Dacre became the Norma Desmond of journalism Read more\n\nPhotography and design are crucial to magazines. Green: \u201cSome shoots \u2013 particularly cover shoots with celebrities \u2013 are extremely labour intensive ... Photographers/studios need to be booked \u2013 these can be in London, Los Angeles, New York. We need stylists, hair and makeup artists ... We are dealing with [and receiving pitches from] publicists around the world ... [We] often work LA time if we are dealing with Hollywood stars.\u201d\n\nDenes: \u201cFor our cover story on the new season of The Crown, we had few images from behind the scenes and no shoot with Olivia Colman \u2013 so commissioned a classic red first-class stamp with a Queen Colman turning to face the reader. Often restrictions like this produce our best or most creative work.\u201d\n\nAs deadlines approach and the week\u2019s production pace picks up, the editors have to step into other rhythms too: meetings with advertising and sales, marketing, legal; discussion with other section editors; listening to writers; and perhaps \u201clooking at different inks\u201d which the design team has been testing.Close to going to press \u2013 production requirements mean this is days before the papers which will contain the magazines \u2013 proofs need to be read, headlines finessed and promotion considered. Then it\u2019s done. The finished issues arrive in the office and it is time to \u201cstart worrying about the next one\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Paul Chadwick is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor", "description": "A look behind the scenes at two Guardian and Observer titles reveals dedicated teams working to a non-stop beat, says Paul Chadwick, reader\u2019s editor", "authors": ["Paul Chadwick"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bf6ebad928dd6ed6293a4399f01069ad87ffe53/100_176_5258_3155/master/5258.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0b7ee7113bd7af15adc61d054347807d", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
