Africa\u2019s Kganyago Confident on Economic Growth After Rebound", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here.\n\nA surprise rebound in economic growth in the second quarter means Africa\u2019s most-industrialized economy is on track to expand this year, central bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago said.\n\nThe central bank is \u201ccomfortable\u201d with its forecast that the economy will grow 0.6% this year, Kganyago said Wednesday in an interview at the World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town. If realized, that would be the slowest full-year rate of expansion since 2016.\n\nSouth Africa averted a second recession in as many years after growth recovered to 3.1% in the second quarter, data published on Tuesday showed. That beat the median estimate of 2.5% by 17 economists in a Bloomberg survey.\n\n\u201cEven if we get zero growth for the next two quarters, the South African economy will still grow by 0.3% this year,\u201d Kganyago said. \u201cTo get growth of say 1%, the remaining two quarters of the year would have to grow by between 3.6% and 4.5% -- that\u2019s not quite a scenario that we are looking at at the moment and we are still quite comfortable with 0.6%.\u201d\n\nThe return to growth reduces pressure on the central bank to lower interest rates when its Monetary Policy Committee meets in two weeks. The MPC loosened policy at its July meeting after the economy contracted a revised 3.1% in the first quarter.\n\nKganyago said inflation is currently \u201cwell contained\u201d within the central bank\u2019s 3% to 6% target range. Risks to the outlook have abated somewhat, he said.\n\n\u201cAt the time of our previous MPC meeting, we identified the risks as being the exchange rate, being oil prices and so forth,\u201d Kganyago said. \u201cBoth variables seem to have behaved and had actually provided the space for the risks to be mitigated somewhat. But in 14 days time we\u2019ll be making a reassessment.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s annual inflation rate dropped to 4% in July, the lowest in six months, from 4.5% a month earlier.\n\n(Updates with comment by Kganyago in fourth paragraph)", "description": "S.
