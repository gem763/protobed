The second-year quarterback missed the last three games due to a bout with mono, which caused him to have an enlarged spleen.\n\nDarnold said he felt healthy enough to play last week, but he was still experiencing some swelling in his spleen.\n\n\u201cI feel good. Energy\u2019s awesome,\u201d Darnold said Monday. \u201cJust looking to play this week, but [have to] wait for the doctor\u2019s orders [Tuesday]. I\u2019m excited to hear the news, I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be good news. I thought maybe it would come last week, but had to wait it out again.\n\n\u201cHopefully this week it\u2019s better news and I get to practice and get ready for a game on Sunday.\u201d\n\nDarnold took first-team reps in practice last week before being ruled out for the Jets\u2019 Week 5 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday night. He hasn\u2019t played since a season-opening loss to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nDarnold is expected to provide an immediate boost to the Jets\u2019 struggling offense. New York (0-4) has scored only two offensive touchdowns this season.\n\nIn one start this season, Darnold completed 28-of-41 passes for 175 yards and one touchdown.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold was cleared for contact and will return this week after being diagnosed with mononucleosis.
