Read more\n\nSanders will be joined by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who gave a surprise endorsement to Sanders this week. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district is less than a mile from Long Island City, the Queens neighborhood where Sanders will stage his rally.\n\nThe \u201cBernie\u2019s Back Rally\u201d will kick-off the senator\u2019s comeback. The Vermont senator abruptly paused his campaign at the beginning of October, after undergoing treatment for an artery blockage. Sanders had a heart attack after being released from hospital.\n\nAt 78, Sanders is the oldest Democratic candidate. If elected, he will be the oldest president inaugurated.\n\nAs he was recovering from his heart attack, Sanders said the nature of his campaign was going to change, alluding to the relentless schedule he had previously followed. He told reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vermont he had felt \u201cmore fatigued than I usually have been\u201d over the last few months and should have \u201clistened to those symptoms\u201d.\n\nJust a day later, the old Bernie was back. He said he \u201cmisspoke\u201d would be getting \u201cback into the groove of a very rigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings\u201d. The media, he said, \u201cdrives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal out of it\u201d.\n\nSanders was out on the debate stage Tuesday night, his old self, wagging his finger and taking bites from other candidates.\n\nWhen CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett tried to change the subject from drug companies to \u201cthe issues of candidates and their health\u201d, Sanders interjected: \u201cI\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great!\u201d The crowd burst into applause.\n\nThough Sanders trails former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren in most polls, he is beating them in fundraising. From July to September, Sanders raised $25.3m, edging out Warren\u2019s $24.6m and Biden\u2019s $15.2m.\n\nThe Chicago teachers' strike shows how to go on offense against neoliberalism | Miles Kampf-Lassin and Micah Uetricht Read more\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement, probably joined by least one other member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d of progressive congresswomen of which she is a member, is expected to boost or at least sustain Sanders\u2019 support.\n\nIn many ways, the endorsement shows Ocasio-Cortez going back to her roots. Before she became a political celebrity in her own right, she was an organizer for Sanders. Some founders of Justice Democrats, the political action committee that helped organize her campaign, are former Sanders staffers.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s debate, when asked how he would \u201creassure Democratic voters that you\u2019re up to the stress of the presidency\u201d, Sanders plugged Saturday\u2019s rally.\n\nIt would just be a continuation of his campaign, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.\u201d", "description": "Presidential hopeful marks return to campaign after heart attack with support from member of progressive squad", "authors": ["Lauren Aratani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c308ce103026b0885383d91dfce2bd7a7e088b94/0_95_3058_1835/master/3058.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=057c0ba8c6412043c5fa6d71f700356c", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
