Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin shows little sign of major shift\n\nData from Coin360 showed broadly sideways activity for BTC/USD on Tuesday, with 24-hour figures between $8,160 and $8,290.\n\nAfter two attempts to grind higher, the pair saw rejection at $8,300, in line with projections from analysts who previously identified heavy resistance close to $8,500.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin has remained quiet since the start of the weekend, when markets managed to exit the $7,000 range and stay higher since.\n\nThe short-term outlook nonetheless contains few surprises, Cointelegraph contributors agreed, with Micha\u00ebl van der Poppe not expecting significant shifts as the week progresses.\n\n\u201cTo me it looks like an inside day in which we're stuck between two levels (on the upper side; $8,300 and on the downside $8,170) without making a clear decision yet,\u201d he said in private comments.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cIf either way we crack one of the levels, a volatile move should occur of a few hundred dollars. On the upside, if we clear $8,300 I wouldn't be surprised with a push towards $8,500-8,600, however if we break the lower floor, a retest of $8,000 is quite likely to occur.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, while price volatility has lessened, investor interest is still evolving. Institutional money continues to pour in, with long positions on Bitcoin futures contracts more than doubling in October.\n\nAltcoins bide their time\n\nAltcoins meanwhile showed slightly more movement. While no token saw significant shifts, the top ten by market cap typically moved up and down by around 2%.\n\nEther (ETH), the largest altcoin, traded down 1.5% at $174. By contrast, it was XRP that delivered daily gains, this time of 1.3% to reach just below $0.30.\n\nEther seven-day price chart.
