Don\u2019t put up with Netflix\u2019s atrocious dubbing.\n\nThey go to a lot of trouble to supply actors droning lifeless English dialogue out of sync over the original scenes. Every show ends up sounding like a bad spaghetti Western.\n\nUnless you\u2019re fluent in Japanese, reputedly the world\u2019s most difficult language, you\u2019ll need the subtitles for Giri/Haji (BBC2).\n\nForeign crime drama, however good, usually ends up on BBC4, but this fast-paced thriller deserves its more prominent billing.\n\nThey go to a lot of trouble to supply actors droning lifeless English dialogue out of sync over the original scenes.

Foreign crime drama, however good, usually ends up on BBC4, but this fast-paced thriller deserves its more prominent billing\n\nThere is very little gore \u2014 he doesn\u2019t even drop his chopsticks. As the camera pulls out, we realise all the diners in the restaurant have been killed in their seats, posing for one last cartoon frame.\n\nTakehiro Hira is the embittered detective Kenzo, sent to London from Tokyo to solve the broker\u2019s murder and convinced the killer must be his own brother \u2014 \u2018the most feared assassin in Japan\u2019.\n\nKenzo meets Scottish police lecturer Sarah (Kelly Macdonald), whose career has hit a dead end though she\u2019s more resourceful than the average CID plodder \u2014 when she discovers someone has posted a poisonous snake through her letterbox, she chases it away with a cigarette lighter.\n\nMind you, the yobbos round her way must be pretty ambitious if they\u2019re sticking black mambas through people\u2019s doors instead of the usual fireworks.\n\nWill Sharpe, best known for dark sitcoms Defending The Guilty and Flowers, stands out as a rent boy with a vicious tongue and a blond quiff, who knows all the shadiest Japanese haunts in London.\n\nIt\u2019s all highly stylised, demanding to be taken seriously as a dark crime thriller, yet teetering on high camp. If you enjoyed Killing Eve, you\u2019ll love Giri/Haji.\n\nThat leaves little room to talk about Charlotte Church: My Family And Me (C4), which is fine because there\u2019s little to be said.\n\nThe former child star went camping on Dartmoor with her parents, James and Maria, and let us eavesdrop on some staged conversations about their past fall-outs.\n\nJames, 55, has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, a piece of rotten luck that he bears bravely: he\u2019s been blessed with a wonderful life, he says, and wishes there could be more of it.\n\nMother and daughter are a couple of drama llamas, hogging every conversation with their histrionics.\n\nJames was caught between two hormonal tornados and couldn\u2019t get halfway through a sentence without one of them cutting him off. But he obviously loved it that way.\n\nCanine crime of the night:\n\nPCs Alan and Andy, in a patrol car on The Met: Policing London (BBC1), had their eye on a likely villain \u2014 a bloke walking his dog. They reckoned the mutt was just a prop, an excuse to chat up women.
