(Image: Fox Kids,Image: Hungarian National Television)\n\nThe theme song to X-Men: The Animated Series is undeniably amazing, but now there are accusations that it was stolen. A Hungarian man has filed a lawsuit against Marvel, Disney, Fox, Apple, Amazon, and others \u2014 along with folks from Saban Entertainment \u2014 claiming that the theme song was plagiarised.\n\nio9 has looked over the lawsuit, which was filed Monday and first reported by TMZ. Zoltan Krisko, who claims to be managing the estate for Hungarian composer Gyorgy Vukan, says Vukan\u2019s theme song for the 1980s crime drama Linda the Policewoman bears striking similarity to the one created for X-Men: The Animated Series, which debuted almost a decade later in 1992.\n\nYou can listen to the theme song below. It\u2019s hard to deny how alike they sound.\n\nLinda the Policewoman, which was created by Gy\u00f6rgy G\u00e1t and distributed by Hungarian National Television, is described in the lawsuit as a \u201chousehold name.\u201d That\u2019s not inaccurate. Running from 1983 to 1989, Linda was a popular show that not only brought kung fu fighting styles to Eastern Europe television but also apparently contributed to reshaping gender norms during the Iron Curtain.\n\nEven though Hungary was isolated from much of the Western world during this time, the lawsuit claims the folks behind X-Men\u2019s theme song still associated with Hungarian animators, which could have exposed them to Linda. The suit includes:\n\nDuring the 1980s, cooperation between film industry professionals from different countries, including from the \u201cEastern\u201d and \u201cWestern\u201d world, existed despite the still standing Iron Curtain. Based on information and belief, as professionals in the animation film industry, Defendants Ronald Wasserman, Haim Saban and Shuki Levy all came in contact with Hungarian professionals in the film industry, and were aware of the famous animation workshop at Pannonia Filmstudio in Hungary, where Hungarian film industry professionals, such as Gyorgy Vukan, were frequent visitors.\n\nAlong with the companies, Krisko is suing Ron Wasserman and Shuki Levy, two composers for X-Men: The Animated Series who have each at one point taken credit for the theme song. The suit accuses several companies and folks that produced, distributed, syndicated, or otherwise profited from the show of enabling the copyright infringement of Vukan\u2019s work (a problem that could still continue, since Disney is reportedly considering putting the series on Disney+).\n\nThat said, Vukan\u2019s composition wasn\u2019t registered for copyright in the United States until 2017, which is when Krisko said he first learned about X-Men: The Animated Series. Krisko is asking for damages and to award any profits attributable to him, and asking the court to restrain them and others from infringing on the copyright further.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the X-Men theme song has been accused of borrowing from other works. Several folks have cited its similarity to Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Your Baby Tonight,\u201d which came out in 1990. But unlike this situation, it doesn\u2019t look like that ever resulted in a lawsuit.", "description": "The theme song to X-Men: The Animated Series is undeniably amazing, but now there are accusations that it was stolen.
