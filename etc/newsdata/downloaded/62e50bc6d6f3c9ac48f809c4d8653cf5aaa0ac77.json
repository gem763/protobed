Head injuries are any form of wound inflicted to one's brain, skull or scalp. They vary in severity from minor bruising which can be treated with an ice pack, to traumatic brain injuries which require immediate treatment by a doctor. The most frequently sustained head injuries are concussions and fractures. Head injuries are divided into two categories: open or closed, depending on whether the skull has been cracked open. While some injuries elicit bleeding, it is not a feature of all head injuries. Causes Head injuries are caused by either shaking or blows to the skull. Shaking-induced injuries are most prevalent in infants. Whereas blows to the head could happen to anyone, by falling, sports collisions, assaults etc. Types of head injury Hematoma: Clotting of blood outside blood vessels. Hemorrhage: Uncontrolled bleeding either around the brain or in brain tissue. Concussion: Impact-induced brain injury which typically only causes temporary malfunctioning. Edema: Swelling of tissues. Serious if it occurs in the brain. Skull fracture: Damage to the skull, one of the only bones not to have bone marrow. Diffuse axonal injury: An injury to the brain that doesn\u2019t cause bleeding but does damage the brain cells.\n\nResearchers say it is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with an estimated 69million new cases each year.\n\nThe Clinical Randomisation of an Antifbrinolytic in Significant Head Injury (CRASH-3) trial is one of the largest clinical trials ever carried out into head injury.\n\nEarly treatment is critical because TXA prevents bleeds from getting worse, but cannot undo damage already done.\n\nAccording to the study, there was a 10 per cent reduction in treatment effectiveness for every 20-minute delay.\n\nProfessor Antoni Belli of trauma neurosurgery at the University of Birmingham and co-investigator for the trial, said: 'This is a landmark study.\n\n'After decades of research and many unsuccessful attempts, this is the first ever clinical trial to show that a drug can reduce mortality after traumatic brain injury.\n\n'Not only do we think this could save hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide, but it will no doubt renew the enthusiasm for drug discovery research for this devastating condition.'\n\nRoad accidents and falls are the most common causes of TBI worldwide. In both cases, patients can experience permanent disability or death.\n\nRepresentatives from UK charity Roadpeace were involved in the design of the trial.\n\nAmy Aeron-Thomas, justice and advocacy manager from Roadpeace and co-author of the paper, said: 'It's always better to prevent road crashes in the first place, but these results show that if a crash can't be prevented, death can still be avoided.\n\n'Given the time to treatment implications, it's more important than ever that the post-crash response is as efficient as possible.'\n\nIn the UK, 500mg of tranexamic acid costs roughly \u00a31.55, so the total dose used in CRASH-3 would be about \u00a36.20.\n\nPatients were randomly allocated to receive a loading dose of 1g infused over 10 minutes, started immediately after randomisation, followed by an intravenous infusion of 1g over eight hours, or matching placebo.", "description": "Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine believe\u00a0  transexamic acid (TXA) could slash Britain's death toll from traumatic brain injuries by 20 per cent.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/17/19700684-0-image-a-19_1571070412509.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
