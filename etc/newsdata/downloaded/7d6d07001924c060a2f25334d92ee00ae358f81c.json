Just look at his hotel.", "language": "en", "text": "Trump, after acknowledging that he suspended military aid to Ukraine just before a phone call with the Ukrainian president in which he sought dirt on Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, released a rough transcript of the call, as though the moves would exonerate him. Instead, they provided evidence Trump was proposing the very arms-for-dirt trade he denies:\n\nUkrainian president: \u201cI would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. Specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins [anti-tank missiles] from the United States for defense purposes.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though. . . . I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to ask for help undermining the Russia probe\u2019s findings and digging up dirt on Biden and his son.\n\nWhoa \u2014 a quid pro quo, no?\n\nAlexandra Petri: But was it quid pro quo? A guide.\n\nAs the call notes were being released, a joint House committee opened a hearing on Trump\u2019s lease of the Old Post Office, now the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump has violated the plain language of the lease (it says no U.S. elected official can be part of or benefit from the lease), and the plain language of the Constitution (it says no U.S. officeholder can accept payments from any \u201cforeign state\u201d). But the General Services Administration found a novel way to avoid declaring that Trump had obviously violated both: It looked the other way.\n\nHow did the GSA, under Trump\u2019s authority, declare his hotel in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with its lease? Well, in two hours of testimony by GSA Inspector General Carol F. Ochoa and Trump appointee Dan Mathews, the GSA\u2019s commissioner of the Public Buildings Service, lawmakers learned that GSA:\n\n\u25cf Ignored the emoluments issue and related breach-of-lease issue.\n\n\u25cf Disregarded existing legal precedent and instructions.\n\n\u25cf Didn\u2019t seek legal guidance from the Justice Department.\n\n\u25cf Ignored the inspector general\u2019s recommendation that it revisit the emoluments question.\n\n\u25cf Doesn\u2019t audit the property, instead taking the word of Trump\u2019s accountants.\n\n\u25cf Doesn\u2019t keep track of payments by foreign governments.\n\n\u25cf Won\u2019t provide financial information about the hotel to Congress.\n\n\u25cf Won\u2019t provide its legal reasoning to Congress.\n\n\u25cf Resolved the matter by deciding to remove conflict-of-interest restrictions on Trump (and future presidents) from future GSA leases.\n\nBut there\u2019s really nothing to see here, the Trump appointee explained.\n\n\u201cWe are receiving the proper amount of rent,\u201d Mathews assured the lawmakers.\n\nAnd how can he be sure the treasury isn\u2019t owed more than the $3 million minimum under the lease?\n\n\u201cThe tenant provides the audited financial statement,\u201d Mathews explained.\n\nHad the GSA used its authority to audit the hotel\u2019s books?\n\nIt had not.\n\nDoes it audit any of its properties, which generate some $10 billion in revenue a year?\n\nMathews didn\u2019t know.\n\nWhat we do know is that Trump\u2019s attorney general, William P. Barr, has booked the Trump International for a $30,000 holiday party. A conservative interest group booked the hotel for its gala this month reportedly costing tens of thousands of dollars, featuring speeches by Vice President Pence (at least his 12th speech at the hotel, according to the watchdog group CREW) and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Twenty-five of the 32 officials to have served in Trump\u2019s Cabinet visited the hotel, according to the website 1100 Pennsylvania. Lobbyists, political parties, candidates, PACs and foreign governments such as Saudi Arabia have spent millions of dollars at the hotel. Even campaign officials working for the new Ukrainian president \u2014 the one from whom Trump sought dirt on Biden \u2014 joined in the emoluments parade, spending $1,912 at the Trump hotel\u2019s restaurant in April, the Center for Responsive Politics found.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (N.C.), who led the Republican defense of Trump on the panel, argued that the first legal decision was made by career officials during the transition without \u201cundue influence\u201d (true, but that doesn\u2019t excuse subsequent actions), and that \u201ceverybody seemed to be happy about this until the president was elected\u201d (also true, but his election created the conflict of interest).\n\nOchoa testified that the GSA \u201crecognized that the president\u2019s business interest\u201d in the hotel \u201craised issues under the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clauses.\u201d The \u201cunwillingness to address the constitutional issues,\u201d in turn, affected the decision that Trump\u2019s \u201cbusiness structure satisfied the terms and conditions of the lease.\u201d\n\nShe reminded her wayward colleagues that \u201cGSA, like all government agencies, has an obligation to uphold and enforce the Constitution.\u201d\n\nSo does Congress.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nE.J.
