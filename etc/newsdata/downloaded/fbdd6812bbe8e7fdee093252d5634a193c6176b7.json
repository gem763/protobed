Really thoroughly enjoyed myself. It is hard work, like physically it\u2019s very demanding.\n\n\"And I was so sh*t at the start, I was dancing against people like Fay and Ashley who were incredible \u2013 I was so embarrassed, I was mortified.\"\n\nHowever, the documentary maker did not let this stop her and so she decided to up her training in order to improve.\n\n(Image: UKTV)\n\n\"So I thought I have to put in more hours than everyone else to just not look ridiculous. It wasn\u2019t even about looking great, it was about not looking horrendous. So I was dancing maybe sort of 10 or 12 hours a day,\" explained the star.\"\n\nWhen Angela asked if this was Stacey's rehearsal schedule from the start, the glitterball winner added: \"No, so the first couple of weeks I was filming Glow Up and didn\u2019t have the time so I was doing sort of 3 hours a day.\n\n\"But you have two weeks on the initial dance so they ease you in quite gently then, after that, I had a really horrible week two, I did the cha cha and it was just absolutely\u2026 I can\u2019t even bear it, so cringe.\"\n\n(Image: BBC/Kieron McCarron)\n\nStacey also touched on her reasons for signing up to the series as she needed \"to take a break and do something lighter\" away from her \"super intense\" documentary job that saw her visit war-torn places.\n\nShe shared: \"Work can be super intense. You know it got to the stage, when we said yes to Strictly, it got to the stage where I\u2019d been to Iraq a couple to times, and it was just really emotionally draining, it was really full on.\n\n\"It was a total privilege to do but total hard core. I remember getting out the car and there were so many unexploded IEDS that we could only walk a certain way and we were being chaperoned by the Iraqi forces, the Iraqi army, and it meant that the path that was safe and had been cleared was walking across two bodies, Isis fighters.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC/Kieron McCarron)\n\n\"And I just remember as soon as you get out the car you smell death. Unless you\u2019ve been there it\u2019s very difficult to comprehend or describe but I remember at that moment thinking, it\u2019s remarkable that I\u2019m here and I really want to tell these stories but I also need to take a break maybe and do something a little bit lighter.\"\n\nLast week Stacey's boyfriend Kevin and his 2019 partner Anneka Rice were voted off the show.\n\nAfter the news broke, Stacey took to social media to praise the pair and gush that her beau is \"the most incredible teacher.\"\n\nYou can download Angela Scanlon\u2019s Thanks A Million podcast now on iTunes and Acast.", "description": "The documentary maker, who won last years series of the dancing show and is now dating her professional partner Kevin Clifton, has opened up on her Strictly experience", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Uktv", "Bbc Kieron Mccarron", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20071952.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_uktv_54204075463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
