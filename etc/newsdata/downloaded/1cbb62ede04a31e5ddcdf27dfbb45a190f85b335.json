But all my efforts have come to nothing,\u201d Aziz told AFP.\n\n\u201cIt seems we have to change our eating patterns, omitting onion from curries and our daily menu.\u201d\n\nThe eye-watering prices have also forced some restaurants to chop the bulb from their menus.\n\n\u201cWe used to give free onion with green salad to our customers. But we no longer do it,\u201d a Dhaka restaurant waiter told AFP.\n\nMeanwhile consumers have accused wholesalers of hoarding the vegetable to jack up prices, a charge they deny.\n\nHeavy monsoon rains in key onion-growing regions have been blamed for the current shortage in India.\n\nIn an effort to arrest further price rises, New Delhi imposed the export ban and suppliers and distributors are blocked from stocking up.\n\nSome reserve onion stocks held by the national government are also being sold in several states at subsidised prices.", "description": "Dhaka (AFP) \u2013 A ban on onion exports by India has caused shortages, soaring prices and widespread anger in neighbouring Bangladesh, where the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
