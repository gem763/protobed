If the House votes tonight for an early general election, my tenure as speaker and MP will end when this parliament ends.\n\n\u201cIf the House does not so vote, I have concluded that the least disruptive and most democratic course of action would be for me to stand down at the close of business on Thursday, October 31.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cLeast disruptive because that date will fall shortly after the votes on the Queen\u2019s speech expected on October 21 and 22.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Our democracy is the stronger for your being the speaker. And whatever you do when you finally step down from parliament, you do so with the thanks of a very large number of people.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn offered his thanks on behalf of the Labour Party, noting: \u201cEnjoy the last short period in your office \u2013 but it\u2019s going to be one of the most dramatic there has been.\n\n\u201cI think your choice of timing and dates is incomparable and will be recorded in the history books of parliamentary democracy.\u201d\n\nFor the government, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, said it was clear Mr Bercow loved the House of Commons and democracy, adding: \u201cYour commitment to your principles and to your constituents is unwavering and an example to others.\u201d\n\nMr Gove joked he hoped Mr Bercow would not take it personally when he votes for an early general election on Monday evening, adding: \u201cIt is the case that however controversial the role of the backstop may be in other areas, your role as the backbenchers\u2019 backstop has certainly been one that\u2019s been appreciated by individuals across this House.\u201d\n\nHe added he has \u201cnever been in any doubt\u201d about Mr Bercow\u2019s desire to operate on the basis that the executive must be answerable to the Commons in the same way as the House is answerable to the people.", "description": "John Bercow has announced he will stand down as speaker of the House of Commons by the Brexit deadline of 31 October.
