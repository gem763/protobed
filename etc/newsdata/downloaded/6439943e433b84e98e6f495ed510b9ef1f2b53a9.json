So, as technology advances and the population booms, there is a desperate need to ensure our cities are set up to support rapid growth and a realisation that our governments and industries need to keep up with the pace.\n\nThe future of our cities \u2013 and how they will handle the challenges that are on the horizon \u2013 was the topic of discussion with leaders across industry at a recent roundtable hosted by Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nRecognising the increased collaboration across industries and the blurring of lines between different sectors of the economy, the Commonwealth Bank recently realigned its Institutional Banking and Markets division into ecosystems. This ecosystem model has allowed the Bank to look at the interdependencies between different corporations and industries and provide a more holistic service offering.\n\nThis is particularly important for Commonwealth Bank\u2019s future cities ecosystem where the interdependencies between corporations and the surrounding corporations are so critical to the operating efficiency, liveability, and amenity of our growing metropolises. By bringing together industries such as real estate, social and economic infrastructure along with sustainable finance, Commonwealth Bank seeks to provide a proactive platform for cooperation and collaboration for the major players and interconnected corporations, which are critical to the development of our cities.\n\nMichael Thorpe, Commonwealth Bank\u2019s managing director, future cities ecosystem said, \u201cAs a society we are thinking more carefully about city design and how we live, work and access amenity. The ecosystem approach means the Bank can better support co-dependent industries across property, infrastructure and technology. We think the combination of these industries is really powerful and brings together a wide range of capabilities and allows us to take advantage of those interdependencies for our clients.\u201d\n\nThorpe said one of the Bank\u2019s main purposes, which is realised through its future cities ecosystem, is to support the liveability, equality and amenity of Australian cities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very keen to be associated with financing the development of commercial real estate, residential real estate, economic infrastructure, and social infrastructure, but also looking at projects through the lens of social and affordable housing and other elements that bring the whole of city life together,\u201d Thorpe said.\n\nIt is against this backdrop, the industry leaders joined the Commonwealth Bank roundtable to discuss what the city of the future might look like, what it might try to avoid, and in particular how the four major cities of Australia \u2013 Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney \u2013 will accommodate 75% of the extra 11.8 million people who are going to crowd into our nation by 2046, according to Infrastructure Australia\u2019s1 Future Cities report.\n\n\u201cBy 2033, our population will have grown by 6 million,\u201d Michael Hanna, head of infrastructure for Australia at IFM Investors, told the roundtable. \u201cHow can we accommodate that? The challenge is huge. We\u2019re playing catch up with infrastructure.\u201d\n\nNot only is the population growth substantial, a huge amount of this population will reside in our cities. And by all accounts, we are currently not prepared for the pressure this will add to the existing infrastructure, environment and people\u2019s lives.\n\nOn a global scale, nearly 70% of us will be living in cities by 2050, according to a 2018 UN economic report. At the moment, there are 31 mega-cities in the world and by 2050, there are going to be 41 cities in the world with a population of 10 million or more. At least 90% of this growth will be seen in Asia and Africa, according to the report.\n\nBut don\u2019t think Australia will be spared \u2013 it is one of the most urbanised nations in the world and we need to act now.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
