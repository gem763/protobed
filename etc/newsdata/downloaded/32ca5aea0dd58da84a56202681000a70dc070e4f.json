But instead of rising on those remarks, crude prices fell on Tuesday as Iran\u2019s leader agreed to tweak a nuclear deal that made Trump hit Tehran with sanctions in the first place.\n\nU.S. and U.K. fell more than 2% each after Trump also lashed out at China, signaling dimmer hope for a trade deal between the two nations.\n\nsettled down $1.35, or 2.3%, at $57.29 per barrel.\n\nslid by $1.67, or 2.6%, to $63.10.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani, attending the United Nations General Assembly, told reporters said he was alright with revisting a 2016 nuclear pact that Tehran had agreed with the United States and other foreign powers. Trump tore up that agreement last year, calling the initiative by his predecessor Barack Obama, \u201cthe worst deal ever\u201d and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.\n\nRouhani said on Tuesday he was willing \u201cto discuss small changes, additions or amendments to (the) nuclear deal if sanctions were taken away\u201d, Reuters reported.\n\nTrump, who later addressed the assembly, said \u201cno responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust\u201d, referring to the constant \u201cDeath To America\u201d chants by the Islamic Republic.\n\nWashington has blamed Iran for last week\u2019s attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, an accusation that has gained momentum in the past 24 hours as Europe\u2019s big three \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 joined in fingering Tehran for the Sept. 14 air raids.\n\nThe three nations were original signatories to the 2016 nuclear deal with Iran and had supported the Islamic Republic through much of its sanctions row with the United States.\n\nBut the three also urged Iran on Monday to accept \u201ca long-term negotiation framework for its nuclear program\u201d \u2014 a suggestion seen as coaxing Iran to renegotiate its 2016 agreement with world powers. Rouhani seemed headed that way on Tuesday, after a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, who reiterated that message.\n\nTrump, in his speech to the assembly, indicated no mood to go easy on Iran.\n\n\u201cAs long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted,\u201d said the president, who reinstated a U.S. oil embargo on Iran last November after pulling out of the 2016 nuclear pact earlier in the year. \u201cThey will be tightened.\u201d\n\nBut oil traders who have grown familiar with Trump\u2019s vacillating ways hedged for the possibility that he would meet with Rouhani after all.\n\nA U.S.-Iran summit has been in the cards for months, with Trump even suggesting days before the Saudi attack that he might be open to lifting sanctions as precondition to the talks. Rouhani seemed resistant to any diplomatic efforts then, though the Iranian leader seems to the one extending the olive branch this time, even coming to the U.N. with a peace plan for the Middle East.\n\nTrump\u2019s zeal to be known as a dealmaker is not lost on political strategists who point out that a new Iran nuclear agreement would be a plum prize for the president as he heads into the 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nIran said in May that it intends to produce at least 1.5 million barrels per day of oil if it is to enter and stay in a new nuclear deal with world powers. That could be an onerous burden for a market that has completely discounted Iranian production since the U.S. sanctions came into force in November 2018.\n\n\u201cWhatever Trump says, I still believe he will want to make a deal with Iran and that\u2019s what the market fears \u2014 the oncoming of additional supply it isn\u2019t prepared for,\u201d said John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital Management.\n\nTrump also struck a combative tone against China in his address to the U.N. assembly.\n\n\u201cNot only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale,\u201d the president said.", "description": "Oil Sinks as Iran Agrees To Nuclear Deal Fix, Trump Slams China", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEC060ED_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
