Reid and Associates Inc., who claim the conduct named in the show \u201cis not the Reid Technique\u201d and has resulted in damages.\n\nThe show \u2014 which illustrates how the 1989 rape of a woman in Central Park led to the wrongful convictions of five young black men \u2014 depicts a conversation between the Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Nancy Ryan and a New York detective.\n\n\u201cYou squeezed statements out of them after 42 hours of questioning and coercing, without food, bathroom breaks, withholding parental supervision,\u201d the detective says. \u201cThe Reid Technique has been universally rejected. That\u2019s truth to you.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit claims this \u201cfalsely represents\u201d the Reid Technique, an interrogation method developed by John Reid, a former police officer, in 1974 and has since been taught to a reported 500,000 individuals.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the technique is a \u201cstructured interview and interrogation process\u201d that does not include \u201cdenying a subject any rights, conducting excessively long interrogations, and denying a subject any physical needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cReid also urges that extreme caution and care be taken when interviewing or interrogating juveniles,\u201d they added. \u201cDefendant publications and depictions in Episode Four \u2026 falsely disparage and defame Reid\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit wants the show to be made unavailable to stream until the line is removed from the show along with other damages.\n\nNetflix and Ms. DuVernay did not respond to the BBC\u2019s request for comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
