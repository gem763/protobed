They\u2019re supposed to, if more than 10, they\u2019re supposed to divide it into two. At least if you had a debate with five other people you might actually get a chance to say something. But I\u2019m going to try to be more declarative, but not argumentative.\u201d\n\nBiden said, \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive.\"\n\nOther presidential candidates are still grappling with what to expect from the addition of a newcomer, billionaire Tom Steyer, and a candidate who sharply criticized her fellow Democrats before missing the last debate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\n\n\u201cWho knows what goofy bullshit Steyer will pull, or Gabbard will pull,\u201d an adviser to one candidate said, referring to their urgent need to have a breakthrough moment.\n\nGabbard last week threatened to boycott the debate, while Steyer said his sole plan is to \u201cpresent myself to a whole bunch of Americans who don\u2019t know who I am, to try and explain why I\u2019m running, why I think what I\u2019m saying is important and what the future should look like for America.\u201d\n\nSen.

Barack Obama's presidential campaign in North Carolina in 2008, said, \u201cIt\u2019s probably really frustrating to them, I would think \u2014 the fact that the latest policy announcements or what they\u2019re doing on the campaign trail hardly gets any attention at all, even for the leading candidates.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe impeachment stuff kind of blacks out everything else. It blacks out a discussion of policy. It blacks out anything that\u2019s going on on the campaign trail. It\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nFor months, the 2020 presidential primary had marched forward largely on its own terms \u2014 a steady beat of policy proposals, fundraising, minor skirmishes between rival candidates and organizing offensives in the early nominating states.\n\nBut unlike in previous months, few presidential observers this week are contemplating how many times Biden will associate himself with Obama in the upcoming debate, or how much time will be devoted to climate change.\n\nGreeting reporters following an LGBTQ forum last week, Sen. Cory Booker noted the significance of the event but said \u2014 rightly \u2014 that \"I suspect that that's not going to be what you want to talk about.\"\n\n\u201cPolitics is unpredictable,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cObviously, the Sanders team had not planned for the candidate to have a health incident, but it happened. Now you have to deal with it and move forward. I\u2019m sure, to some degree, the Biden folks would rather not have to deal with the president\u2019s corruptible behavior \u2026 But they\u2019re stuck in the middle of it.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cBut here it is. So, for them, it\u2019s an external event that they\u2019ve got to be able to roll with.\u201d\n\nTrump's unsubstantiated attacks on Biden do not appear to have damaged him with Democratic voters. It is possible they have helped. A Fox News poll last week found 21 percent of Democrats say Trump's claims about Biden and his son\u2019s business dealings make them more likely to vote for Biden. Just 10 percent say they are less likely to. Thirty-one percent say they are less likely to vote for Sanders because of concerns about his health, compared to 15 percent who say they are more likely to.\n\nEven before Sanders' heart attack and Trump's unloading on Biden on Ukraine, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s surge in public opinion polls had become problematic for both Biden and Sanders \u2014 the RealClearPolitics polling average placed her ahead of Biden for the first time last week. And Warren is unencumbered by Sanders\u2019 health scare or Biden\u2019s family connections.\n\nLongabaugh said, \u201cTo the degree that the Sanders and Biden campaigns have challenges they need to deal with \u2014 different challenges \u2014 I think Elizabeth Warren is in a commanding position here. She\u2019s on message, she has been on the move and rising. She\u2019s been running the best campaign of anybody in the field. And I think, when you\u2019re in a race and a couple of the other two frontrunning candidates are facing challenges, and you\u2019re still running in clean air, just to be crass about it, it\u2019s advantage Warren.\u201d\n\nSanders has taken steps in recent days to assure supporters of his health, telling CNN last week that he is \u201cconfident we\u2019re going to be running a very vigorous campaign.\u201d And Biden has forcefully pushed back on coverage of his son\u2019s business activities in Ukraine, telling reporters to focus fully on accusations that Trump abused his power by asking a foreign leader to investigate Biden\u2019s family. Biden called directly for Trump's impeachment last week.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/583/1155968404_6093507521001_6093506906001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nJoel Payne, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said that while Trump\u2019s accusations against Biden have been discredited, \u201ca lot of the stuff that Biden is getting hit on, and being publicly cast as, is a lot of the same stuff Hillary was cast as \u2014 a creature of Washington, a tool of the system.\u201d\n\nFor a progressive Democrat such as Warren or Sanders, Payne said, \u201cit\u2019s a perfect thing for them to attack if they wanted to. But I think they will both be loathe to do it \u2026 You don\u2019t want to be seen as carrying Trump\u2019s water or advancing the argument.\u201d\n\nWarren herself is not without liabilities \u2014 and Biden appears increasingly willing to criticize her for the cost of the progressive policies she proposes. In a veiled swipe at the senator known for her voluminous policy papers, Biden said last week, \u201cIt takes a proven ability to get things done \u2026 We\u2019re not electing a planner.\u201d\n\nDoug Herman, a Democratic strategist, said Biden \u201cmade a pretty clean hit.\u201d And he suggested that Biden, Warren and Sanders are all now vulnerable to attacks from an increasingly desperate field of lower-tier contenders.\n\nIt was in October 2007 \u2014 the same month in the election calendar \u2014 that Hillary Clinton turned in a dismal debate performance against six opponents in Philadelphia, when longshot Chris Dodd started a pile-on surrounding Clinton\u2019s weaving around the question of whether undocumented immigrants should be granted driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nThis year, Herman said, \u201cSanders has the coronary. Warren has several problems she can be hit on, and then you\u2019ve got kind of the Chris Dodds of this year ... What\u2019s Beto do? What\u2019s Yang do? What do those candidates who are in the back of the pack do? How do they make themselves relevant, and at whose expense?\u201d\n\nGeoff Potter, who was Washington Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s debate director before Inslee dropped out of the presidential race in August said that earlier this year. \u201cEveryone assumed that when we got to this point \u2026 there\u2019d be a ton of fewer candidates on the stage.\u201d\n\nBut llike many Democrats, Potter believes that the race is still fluid and that \u201cthe lesson, I think, is not to attempt to proverbially set your hair on fire.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the big variable we don\u2019t know in all of this: to what degree to individual candidates feel, not that this is their last shot, but that the race is truly unsettled.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c1/bf/74fa6367418ba5fed42d61bd0c9e/20191013-warren-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
