Its secret sauce: \"Apparently you just \u2026 show [users] things, and let a powerful artificial intelligence take notes.\"\n\nCeding that control to TikTok should be worrying, according to a Times op-ed: \"Those who complain that American firms like Facebook are invasive and unaccountable are unlikely to prefer China\u2019s tech giants, which are often cowed by, and collaborating with, the Party-State\u2019s opaque and irascible censorship and surveillance apparatus.\"\n\nAnd you can't escape Chinese social media giants on American platforms. As Axios' Sara Fischer reported, ByteDance spent $1 billion advertising TikTok in the U.S. in 2018, growing its audience by buying ads on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.\n\nA similar privacy controversy played out this week with FaceApp, which is owned by a Russian startup, over its use of photos and possible access to users' photo libraries.\n\nThe state of play: There are even possible national security concerns, as New America's Graham Webster told Axios' Erica Pandey, \"Say there\u2019s a sensitive U.S. military officer with a kid who's making memes on TikTok. Is it possible that there\u2019s data being collected through that usage that could be useful to a Chinese intelligence service? Yeah, that\u2019s possible. But we haven\u2019t seen evidence of that yet.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Chinese company that purchased the gay dating app Grindr was forced to agree to sell the company by 2020 and had restrictions placed on its access and use of data by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) due to national security concerns, per Bloomberg.\n\nCFIUS doesn't have to publicly announce its work and can review companies and deals without being asked \u2014 meaning it could already have its all-powerful regulatory eye on ByteDance and TikTok.\n\nThe other side: TikTok says that its \"user data is stored and processed in the U.S. and other markets where TikTok operates at industry-leading third-party data centers. It\u2019s important to clarify that TikTok does not operate in China and that the government of the People's Republic of China has no access to TikTok users' data.\"\n\nYes, but: Quartz's David Carroll discovered that TikTok's privacy policy in late 2018 indicated that user data could be shared \"with any member or affiliate of [its] group\" in China. It later confirmed to him that \"data from TikTok users who joined the service before February 2019 may have been processed in China.\"\n\nThe big picture: The murkiness of TikTok's structure could preview a trend as Chinese companies eye the U.S. and its troves of data. Lorenz's piece touched on an unaffiliated shadow event occurring beside VidCon: the East-West Forum, held by the Tencent-backed Qingteng Club. It \"was targeted toward Chinese tech execs looking to enter the American market.\" As one attendee told her about the off-the-record event...\n\n\"It was mostly people from Chinese companies trying to learn from Americans; they wanted to know what problems we could have here so they could take those learnings back to China.\"\n\n\"Chinese execs were basically like, Tell us everything wrong with your platforms.\"\n\nThe bottom line: While the Big Tech behemoths of the U.S. are barred from making inroads in China, the inverse doesn't apply. That could mark an opening front in the ongoing technological and economic war between the two rivals.\n\nGo deeper: TikTok is rising in the U.S.", "description": "Its parent company views it as an artificial intelligence platform.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/5Q8qA9js4HKVugTG4iP2OIK-DPw=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/07/17/1563389009775.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-20"}
