The bill was formally withdrawn today\n\nAnti-government protesters in Hong Kong initially demanded the extradition bill be withdrawn, but later urged for wider democratic reforms including the right to choose their own leader.

Pictured, police fire tear gas at protesters during a demonstration on October 20\n\nAccording to a report by Financial Times, which quoted unnamed figures briefed on the deliberations, Beijing is drawing up a plan to replace her with an interim chief executive.\n\nHowever, sources told the newspaper that the plan would depend on whether or not the situation in the city would stabilise first. This way Beijing is not seen as giving in to violence.\n\nLam's office said it would not comment on speculation.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said today that the report was a political rumour with ulterior motives.\n\nMinistry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the comments at a daily news briefing in Beijing.\n\nMass demonstrations began in the Asian financial hub in June and were initially sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China to stand trial.\n\nHong Kong's government today formally withdrew the much-hated bill that plunged the city into political turmoil.\n\n'I now formally announce the withdrawal of the bill,' secretary for security John Lee told the city's legislature.\n\nBeijing wants the unrest in Hong Kong to stabilise first before making a final call on the replacement for Lam, according to Financial Times citing sources close to the matter\n\nLam is facing significant headwinds from opposing politicians within the parliament.

A protester is seen opposing to the mask ban\n\nLam's ouster may not be enough to allay the concerns of Hong Kong's protesters.\n\n'The plan definitely has come too late as Carrie Lam's net support... dropped to a disastrous level as early as four months ago,' said political analyst Dixon Sing.\n\n'It is impossible to believe that Hong Kong people... would be happy and go back home once Carrie Lam has stepped down.'\n\nA leaked audio recording emerged in September of Lam saying she would quit if she had a choice - although she later said she had not contemplated standing down.\n\nHer resignation is not one of the protesters' five central demands, who are instead calling for measures including an investigation into police brutality, universal suffrage and the release of arrested protesters without charge.\n\nCarrie Lam had to apologise to the city's Muslim leaders after riot police sprayed a major mosque with blue-dye liquid with water cannons while trying to contain a demonstration.

Pictured, a protester wears a Guy Fawkes mask in defiant of the law during a pro-democracy march from Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong on October 20\n\nTens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Hong Kong to oppose the mask ban\n\n'I don't think replacing Carrie Lam could solve the problem completely,' 18-year-old student Joyce Ho told AFP.\n\n'If the government can respond to the five demands, I believe Hong Kongers would stop (the protests).'\n\nLam has faced a series of political difficulties since the city's legislature returned for a new session last week.\n\nShe was unable to give her State of the Union-style policy speech after pro-democracy lawmakers repeatedly interrupted her, forcing her to deliver the address via video.\n\n'I don't think a change in chief executive will have much impact on the profound political crisis that Hong Kong is facing,' said Ben Bland, director of the Southeast Asia Project at the Lowy Institute, a policy think tank.\n\n'The problem is less who leads Hong Kong and more that its leaders have no popular legitimacy because they are effectively chosen by Beijing.'", "description": "Beijing is drawing up a plan to replace Lam with an interim chief executive, according to a report by Financial Times.
