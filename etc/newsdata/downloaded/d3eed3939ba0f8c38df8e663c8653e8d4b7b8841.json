Hours after word of their arrest emerged on Thursday morning, House Democrats subpoenaed both men for documents due on October 16.\n\n\u201cThe critical question, if they cooperate, is how much they know about Giuliani, Trump and the specifics of their involvement in Ukraine,\u201d Roiphe said. \u201cIf they have confirmation of a quid pro quo, that could solidify the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nTrump, Ukraine and Impeachment\n\nThe indictment connects Parnas and Fruman directly to a key moment in Trump\u2019s impeachment drama: the recall of the former American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, this spring.\n\nThe document asserts that the two men, who are both American citizens, followed up a hefty $325,000 donation to a Trump-friendly super PAC in May 2018 with an attempt to get the U.S. government to remove Yovanovitch \u2014 at the behest of an unnamed Ukrainian politician.\n\nRead: The State Department Is Deep in Trump's Ukraine Scandal. These Text Messages Are Just the Latest Proof\n\nThe indictment says a \u201cCongressman 1,\u201d who has been identified by CNN and others as Pete Sessions, former Republican representative from Texas, received $3 million from that same super PAC. Parnas and Fruman then met with \u201cCongressman 1\u201d and pressed him for help getting rid of the ambassador.\n\nTrump ultimately recalled Yovanovitch in May, shortly before calling her \u201cbad news\u201d on a now-infamous phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President in late July. She\u2019s now scheduled to testify before Congress on Friday.\n\nThose actions took place around the time when both men were busy connecting Giuliani with officials in Ukraine. The two men reportedly helped link Giuliani up with three top Ukrainian prosecutors during his quest to pressure Ukrainian officials to open up an investigation into the Biden family.\n\nGiuliani has publicly identified Parnas and Fruman as his \u201cclients.\u201d But with their indictment on charges of foreign influence peddling and campaign finance violation, Giuliani has brought two men accused of outright crimes directly into Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nRead: Rudy and the Gang: Your Guide to the Cast of Trump's Ukraine Scandal\n\n\n\nTheir new lawyer, Trump\u2019s former attorney John Dowd, linked both men directly to Trump in a letter to Congress sent earlier this month.\n\n\u201cBe advised that Messrs. Parnas and Fruman assisted Mr. Giuliani in connection with his representation of President Trump,\u201d Dowd wrote in a letter to the House Intelligence Committee, cautioning that some of their records might be covered by presidential executive privilege.\n\nThat link makes both men phenomenally potent potential witnesses in the impeachment hearings against Trump, if they can be compelled to tell what they know, legal experts said.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to overstate the degree of damage Giuliani appears to be inflicting on the President these past few months,\u201d said Joseph Moreno, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cHe appears to be a firsthand witness to many of the same issues that Congress is, or soon will be, looking into.\u201d\n\nCover: In this Aug. 1, 2018 file photo, Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for President Donald Trump, addresses a gathering during a campaign event for Eddie Edwards, who is running for the U.S. Congress, in Portsmouth, N.H.(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File )", "description": "\u201cIt is difficult to understate the degree of damage Giuliani appears to be inflicting on the president these past few months\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9f811162c27f0009456d3b/lede/1570734469952-AP_18249853179411.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.9156266956049919xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
