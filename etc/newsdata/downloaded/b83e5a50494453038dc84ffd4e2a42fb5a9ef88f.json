Today, it manages $US500 billion in a variety of investments.\n\nWhen they set out to build the firm, they were Wall Street power players who had fallen out of the circle of power, and they struggled to find clients.\n\nSchwarzman said that all entrepreneurs must be prepared for emotional pain and failure, and that they have to devote themselves fully to a unique project in order to make it worthwhile.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the video:\n\nRichard Feloni: So when you, when you did leave Lehman, you and a former CEO of Lehman, Pete Peterson, you decided that you were going to create your own firm, which, that\u2019s Blackstone. And when you were starting off, you didn\u2019t have any clients, you say you were waiting for the phone to ring. No one was calling. I mean, what were you thinking at this time? Did you regret all of the decisions that you had made that got you to that point?\n\nStephen Schwarzman: It does cross your mind.\n\nSo we spent a few weeks calling everybody and they were very polite, \u201cThanks for the phone call. Wish you well \u2013 don\u2019t have anything for you to do. If something develops, I might give you a call.\u201d So then we finished that and we had no business.\n\nSo I went back into his office, Pete\u2019s office, and I said, Pete, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s wait two weeks and call them all again. We\u2019ll get lucky.\u201d This goes down as great strategy, right? And we actually got someone to hire us.\n\nFeloni: So that ended up working.\n\nIf someone\u2019s listening, maybe they want to build their business or they\u2019re starting something and they don\u2019t even have what you and Peterson were starting with, which is you\u2019re well known, well connected, had financial stability personally. If they\u2019re in that situation, what would you recommend to them as kind of like a lifeline to them?\n\nSchwarzman: What I\u2019d say is, you first of all have to have enormous emotional stability because you\u2019re going to have a lot of setbacks. Secondly, you have to accept the fact that you\u2019re going to be in psychological pain in a way you haven\u2019t before. And it can extend for some time. Third, you should only do it if you\u2019ve thought of something that is really extraordinary. Replicating what somebody else does because you can \u201cdo it better\u201d is a tough way to be successful, particularly if there\u2019s more than just one other organisation doing it.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
