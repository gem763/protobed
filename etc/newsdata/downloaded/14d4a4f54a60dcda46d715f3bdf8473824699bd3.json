If you live in the United States, you cannot.\n\n2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg wants to change that.\n\nOn an upcoming episode of our podcast Recode Decode, which will be released on Monday, July 15, Buttigieg told Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher that he supports a national \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d from the internet.\n\n\u201cSome of these things are fierce technical, as well as legal, as well as constitutional problems,\u201d Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we need to have some level of relationship to the value that is created in our name.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to decide the difference between a piece of data that I hand to a company to use and make money off of, and something that is published,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAs we figure out how these rights are going to work, we need a national framework to do it, and we need a national debate about it.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Vox\u2019s Emily Stewart defined the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d in 2018, when it was embedded in Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR:\n\nThe law also includes the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d \u2014 meaning people can ask platforms to stop disseminating, halt third-party access to, or delete their data. Outlined in Article 17 of the law as the \u201cright to erasure,\u201d it allows people to request that an entity with their personal data delete it and not disseminate it further, so they can essentially take back their consent. The company in theory has to comply unless there is some public interest in the data (say, it\u2019s a public figure, of historical use, etc.), but there is some debate about how it will be enforced. For example, if a public figure wants to have something from her past deleted, it\u2019s not entirely clear whether she\u2019ll be able to do that.\n\nShould Buttigieg get his wish for a \u201cnational debate\u201d about an American version of this right, he may be challenged by freedom of expression advocates who don\u2019t want the government testing the limits of the First Amendment. However, he told Swisher, the big internet platforms are already regulating speech in a vacuum left by the government.\n\n\u201cA lot of these things have arisen because the policy world didn\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Buttigieg told Swisher on the upcoming podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of the tech companies want to be adjudicating what hate speech is \u2026 there\u2019s obviously an extent to which it can\u2019t be done, and that\u2019s the problem with the First Amendment and drawing these lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time a company the size of YouTube or Amazon or Google or Facebook makes a corporate policy decision, what they\u2019re really doing is making a public policy decision,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they have none of the apparatus to make public policy, and I don\u2019t think they want to, to some extent.\u201d\n\nTo make sure you don\u2019t miss the full interview when it comes out on Monday, subscribe to Recode Decode today.
