I told him I would double-bag them and took the items off the till and put the bags on the floor under the counter.\n\n\u201cI was using the stepladder for the top shelf, which blocked me inside the counter area.\n\n\u201cHe came to the side of me asking for penny sweets. I knew it was because he wanted me to move the ladder.\n\n\u201cHe asked how much his items came to and I told him it was around \u00a350. He picked up more items and then started to ask for bottles of wine.\n\n\u201cAs I grabbed a second bottle, he jumped over the counter and grabbed the bags.\n\n\u201cI have always said that if someone came into the shop I would just let them take whatever they want, just leave me alone. It didn't work that way - I grabbed his coat and shouted at him.\"\n\nJayne has worked at Newswise for 37 years - and has been targeted by thieves before.\n\nShe added: \u201cMy son and daughter have gone ballistic. I lost my husband to cancer in December, which was devastating.\n\n\u201cThey said they could have been without a mum and a dad. I just didn\u2019t think and I was so angry.\u201d\n\nThe CCTV shows the cancer-hit owner rush to Jayne's aid after being alerted to the raid.\n\nOwner Michael Prosser, 71, said: \u201cWe have 30 cameras around the shop now, as well as a buzzer to alert people in the house if something is wrong.\n\n\u201cI saw the man jump over the counter on the CCTV and I shot in. I ran through the shop as he fled through the door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here 51 years and had no trouble. It\u2019s a lovely place to live and I wouldn\u2019t want to leave.\u201d\n\nThe robber's coat contained a wallet. It has store loyalty cards and a Cash Converters receipt with a name on it.\n\nA police spokesman said: \"A man entered the shop and jumped over the counter to try to steal alcohol. A woman shop assistant grappled with him and tried to stop him.\n\n\"The suspect managed to break free and got away with a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of vodka. The woman was shaken but uninjured.\"\n\nAnyone with any information about the robbery should call the police on 101, quoting incident number 614 of October 9, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.", "description": "The thief fled with bottles of Jack Daniel's and vodka after targeting the shop in Stoke-on-Trent", "authors": ["Bethan Shufflebotham", "Lorraine King"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660141.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Michael-Prosser-and-Jayne-Callear.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
