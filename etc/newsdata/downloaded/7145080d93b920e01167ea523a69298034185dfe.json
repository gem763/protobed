No doubt that the sudden upward move in U.S. equity indices was the part of initial developments on Sino-U.S. tariff trade tussle, but a steeper decline in global economic growth still more likely than a synchronized recovery, even as multiple central banks dole out rounds of monetary easing, according to economists polled by Reuters in recent weeks. Optimism shared among many analysts that U.S.-China trade tensions would cool off appears to have evaporated. Secondly, Britain's exit from the European Union, set for yet another delay, remains a concern for sentiment more broadly; which may enhance the quantum of volatility in global equity markets.\n\nNo doubt that the most of the major economies have downgraded their growth forecasts for next year, despite their predictions for policy easing; which may keep the uptrend in Gold futures intact during the upcoming weeks. On the other hand Gold futures may take a decisive move before the Fed\u2019s policy decision on interest rates on October 29-30; which may propel not only the precious metals, but also to the base metals too. On the other hand decreasing industrial output at the global level looks evident enough to show the growing concern of global economic slowdown, despite the plethora of economic easing measures from the most of the Central banks of the world.\n\nI find that the global equity markets look ready to take a dramatic bumping move during the first trading session of the upcoming week, but if the take an eruptive move at the same time; will be a primary signal of a \u201cEquity-bulls\u2019 Trap\u201d in global equity markets. I find that a sustainable move of Gold futures above the level of $1525 will confirm an advent of steep slide in global equity markets; as the plethora of technical details on Sino-U.S. tariff issues are still in the stage of primary decision-making before the U.S. President Donald Trump and the Chinese President Xi Jinping come forward to seal a final deal. No doubt that this may likely enhance the volatility in global equity markets; which may result in a steep upward move in Gold futures during the upcoming weeks.
