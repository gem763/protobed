We would be talking about Instagram and fake lives. It is no longer about Heat or Closer magazine or Hello!\n\n'When the show was on people would say \"This is outrageous, this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen\" but now we've seen that they do happen! The show was way ahead of its time.'\n\nThrowback: Laila said the show was 'way ahead of its time' following the Coleen and Rebekah soap-saga Pictured with Helen Latham (Lucy) Zoe Lucker (Tanya) and Sarah Barrand (Shannon)\n\nSpeaking out: In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Laila said the duo proved the most outrageous antics do go on behind-the-scenes of the football world\n\nLaila has revealed she wasn't shocked to discover Coleen, 33, had accused Rebekah of selling stories about her to a tabloid newspaper.\n\nThe drama unfolded last week when the mum-of-four shared an explosive Instagram post naming 'Rebekah Vardy's account' as the leak behind three false stories she planted to test whether they would appear in the media.\n\nRebekah, 37, who is seven months pregnant, fiercely denies any involvement and is currently working with a team of lawyers to clear her name.\n\nLaila's character on Footballers' Wives was no stranger to her own drama after Amber faked her own kidnapping and suffered the loss of her baby after it died when her dog sat on its face.\n\nAnd now Laila believes that Coleen and Rebekah have almost gone as far as the fictional wives on the show, saying: 'They have become caricatures of themselves.'\n\nThe original: Laila, whose character Amber dated David Beckham inspired character Conrad (Ben Price), said Coleen and Rebekah are 'lightweights' compared to their TV counterparts\n\nShe explained: 'I wasn\u2019t shocked by it \u2013 I found it all quite amusing to be honest. I love Coleen.\n\n'It's about these two very famous women. But they\u2019re lightweights in comparison to the Footballers' Wives!\n\n'Within the world of football everyone knows everyone. Our characters were heavily inspired by the real footballers' wives \u2013 Amber was inspired by Victoria and Conrad, David.'\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Rebekah revealed she's been left devastated by Coleen's accusation and the torrent of abuse that has followed from hateful trolls that have sent her death threats.\n\nKeep smiling: Coleen, pictured on a night out last week after the drama, accused Rebekah of leaking stories about her to the press\n\nMother-of-one, Laila, who runs Footballers' Wives inspired business Bag My Shoes, said Coleen should have been more careful when bringing the issue to public attention.\n\nShe said: 'I don\u2019t know if it was wise of Coleen to put it on a public forum, it's difficult to say.\n\n'But we do have to be careful how we handle situations. I was shocked by the death threats Rebekah was getting. I found that really concerning.\n\n'You have a woman who is pregnant and receiving death threats but I'm sure that wasn\u2019t Coleen\u2019s intention.'", "description": "The actress, 48, said the saga between the real-life wives of Wayne and Jamie proved the show was 'ahead of its time' - but Coleen and Rebekah are 'lightweights' compared to their TV counterparts.", "authors": ["Sarah Packer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/17/19848148-0-image-a-2_1571331387186.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
