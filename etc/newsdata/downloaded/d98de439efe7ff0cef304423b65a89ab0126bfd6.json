It also arguably returned the advantage to the Astros, who will have ace Gerrit Cole on the mound Sunday for Game 5 and are now guaranteed to return to Houston for Game 6 and, if necessary, Game 7.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGoing into the series, the Nationals appeared to have the pitching advantage in Game 4 because they have a four-man rotation, unlike the Astros, who have leaned on three traditional starters this postseason in Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke. Urquidy, a relative unknown on the national stage before Saturday, somehow outshined all three.\n\n\u201cEven his reaction to me telling him that he\u2019s starting was just businesslike and ready to go. That was very impressive to me,\u201d Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know who he was, I think this stage will make sure everybody knows who he is now.\u201d\n\nIn the American League Division Series against Tampa Bay, Hinch opted to use Verlander on short rest in Game 4 rather than make it a bullpen game with a series of arms. The Astros went with the latter strategy in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series against the New York Yankees, when Houston used seven pitchers in a 6-4 win.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery World Series game is a bullpen game, mostly. At some point, it feels like it,\u201d Hinch said after Friday night\u2019s Game 3, when he used five relievers.\n\nHinch said he didn\u2019t consider Saturday a bullpen game because he was hopeful Urquidy could get the team through five or six innings, despite the 24-year-old not starting a game all postseason. The most he had thrown in October was 2\u2154 innings, a 45-pitch outing against the Yankees in which he allowed a solo home run. While Urquidy\u2019s numbers were nothing special this season \u2014 he had a 3.95 ERA in nine regular season games with the Astros and a 4.46 ERA in 20 minor league appearances between Class AA and AAA \u2014 he is expected to be part of Houston\u2019s rotation next year. Just 10 weeks ago, in a game with Class AAA Round Rock, Urquidy was dinged for 11 runs in 4\u2154 innings.\n\n\u201cWhen we sent him back down, it was really just sort of a gap in time where we needed to work on a few things,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cThe strike throwing, we needed him to continue to evolve with that. He got beat up a little bit and had one blowup game in [Class AAA] that was unlike him. He had a lot of homers and a lot of hits and maybe took our advice to be in the strike zone a little bit too much.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThen when he came back, I noticed that that didn\u2019t really change him. That didn\u2019t shy him away from the strike zone. It didn\u2019t derail his confidence. He was able to handle the moment.\u201d\n\nHe handled the moment just fine Saturday, too, and it seemed that Hinch might have pulled him too early, especially after reliever Josh James struggled to start the sixth, getting charged with Washington\u2019s lone run. Through five innings, Urquidy had thrown just 67 pitches and didn\u2019t walk anyone, and Hinch said part of his rationale for yanking him at that juncture was to save him in case the Astros need him out of the bullpen later in the series.\n\nIt helped that Urquidy got early run support, with the Astros scoring two runs in the first and adding two in the fourth on catcher Robinson Chirinos\u2019s homer. Third baseman Alex Bregman\u2019s grand slam in the seventh gave the bullpen more breathing room.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was some insurance that our pitching staff deserved,\u201d Bregman said. \u201cThey were fantastic all game.\u201d\n\nUrquidy said he got coffee with his mother, Alma, on Saturday morning, and he admitted to feeling nervous before the game. The nerves dissipated once he got through the first inning, when he threw just 11 pitches. Less than 24 hours earlier, upon learning that he would be making his first postseason start \u2014 in the World Series of all stages \u2014 he said he was \u201cliving the dream.\u201d Then he turned it into reality.\n\nAD", "description": "The Astros starter went five scoreless innings and claimed the win in Game 4.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rXm-ZAzCWbNB4Tx73E5cmVWc4Ik=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LS4OSGHYNEI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
