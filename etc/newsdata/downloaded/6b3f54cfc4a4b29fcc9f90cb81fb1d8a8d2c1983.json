They are determined to swiftly nail down facts at the heart of a whistle-blower complaint detailing Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to press Ukraine\u2019s leader to help smear Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president.", "description": "House investigators postponed their first impeachment deposition amid a bitter back-and-forth with the secretary of state over access and transparency.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Lara Jakes"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/us/politics/vidxx-trump-ukraine-1/vidxx-trump-ukraine-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
