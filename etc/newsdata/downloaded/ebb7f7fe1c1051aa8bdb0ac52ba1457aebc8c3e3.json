He used an AR-15 rifle, according to reports. So, the anti-gun Left is going to go on another illiberal tear. They\u2019ll peddle the same nonsense; despite that fact that it appears Ator has had run-ins with the law and had previously failed a background check. I know this is hard for the Left, but let\u2019s wait and see what details trickle out before you all start trying to fundraise off the bodies of the victims.\n\nNow, let\u2019s go to Vox writer Aaron Stupar who has been making the rounds, voicing his annoyance over the fact that the liberal media gets called out all the time for not knowing proper gun terminology.\n\nImagine trying to tell someone whose loved one was gunned down by an AR-15 that they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about because they aren\u2019t familiar with arcane gun terminology. It\u2019s just absurd. https://t.co/MfLpKFLB3z \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 2, 2019\n\n\u201cImagine trying to tell someone whose loved one was gunned down by an AR-15 that they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about because they aren\u2019t familiar with arcane gun terminology. It\u2019s just absurd,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nI am that someone.\n\n\n\nPrecision in language is vital. As a journalist this should not be an arcane concept for you. https://t.co/0M6OjFxCM5 \u2014 Ryan Petty (@rpetty) September 2, 2019\n\nHe tried to hide behind an emotional argument, which got blown up by a father of a Parkland victim. Ryan Petty lost his 14-year-old daughter, Alaina, in the shooting and took Stupar to the woodshed, saying language matters.\n\n\u201cI am that someone,\u201d responded Petty. \u201cPrecision in language is vital. As a journalist this should not be an arcane concept for you.\u201d\n\nOuch. And it wasn\u2019t just Petty who took this Vox writer to task over his AR-15 hot take:\n\nThis is silly and pedantic. AR-15s are bad and you don\u2019t need to know what the acronym stands for to understand that https://t.co/3lQspYBv66 \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 2, 2019\n\nIt's not \"silly and pedantic\" to be informed about topics you're discussing. You ought to be informed if you want people to take your opinion seriously. Also, informing people is supposed to be the entire point of journalism. https://t.co/m8RQmdoxGn \u2014 Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) September 2, 2019\n\nAnd, no, AR-15s aren't bad. They're fantasticly versital rifles used by tens of millions of Americans for everything from competition shooting to hunting to home defense. They're the most popular rifle in the country for good reasons. \u2014 Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) September 2, 2019", "description": ".09/02/2019 20:01:51PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2015/244/d5cdf445-2cda-4ddf-be64-1ad70513f148.jpg"}
