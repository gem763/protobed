The Sterling dollar pair touched its highest point today since 15th July. The currency made a high of 1.2582 today and it is down only -1.37 percent year to date or in other words, it has rallied more than 5% from this year's low.\n\nEuropean Commission\u2019 President Jean Claude Juncker said that a deal can be done with the UK without the backstop and the UK can leave the EU without this provision, but only if the British Prime Minister, Borish Johnson provides an adequate alternative. Clearly, the credit goes to Mr. Johnson because the previous Prime Minister failed to move the needle to this extent.\n\nPrice Change Weekly Chart\n\nThe current development has created enormous optimism among Sterling bulls today. It is highly likely that the currency can top the level of 1.26 against the dollar. Overall, it is safe to say that the momentum is strong for Sterling and the current change in the EU narrative has opened the door for a major rally.

If we continue to see a strong possibility of a deal happening with the EU, it will be a no brainer for Sterling to cross well about the level of 1.35 against the dollar during this month.\n\nOn the other side, if no-deal Brexit becomes a reality, then bears will come back with a vengeance. This is where the conversation of parity becomes intriguing.\n\nWhat About 100?\n\nGBP/USD Weekly Chart\n\nThere is always a question of what does this strength in Sterling means for the . Historically speaking, there is a strong correlation between Sterling and the FTSE 100 index as shown in the chart below. Simply put, this means that strong Sterling brings weakness for the FTSE 100 index. However, this time this isn't all that simple, this is because if we see a possible deal with the EU, this would mean more trading opportunities and a bigger market. Traders would consider that as an opportunity rather than a risk. This could push the FTSE 100 index higher and the current negative correlation would become positive between the FTSE 100 and Sterling.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Naeem Aslam covering: GBP/USD, FTSE 100, US Dollar Index Futures.
