'I am afraid I could die here. The camp is very tense. We don't know what is going on. When the Turkish offensive began many of the women here waited to take advantage of it to hurt those who had left ISIS.'\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nBegum, 19, is living nine miles from the Turkish border in al-Roj camp within the Turkey's 'safe zone' which they ferociously began bombing earlier this month\n\nUnder the agreement reached between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan this week, Kurdish forces - who have been guarding some 10,000 ISIS fighters and their families - must withdraw from the buffer zone.\n\nThat encompasses Begum's al-Roj camp and the authorities running it told The Times there have already been escape attempts by jihadists.\n\nThey also said women deemed to be disloyal to the so-called caliphate had been targeted in the diminishing security.\n\nBegum said she was married 10 days after arriving in Raqqa to a Dutchman who had converted to Islam, Yago Riedijk, who she claimed was later arrested, charged with spying and tortured\n\nBegum told The Times: 'There is the fear that if the Kurds leave there could be chaos here, anarchy, and that our lives would be at risk from dangerous people in this camp. There are some psychotic women in here.'\n\nShe spoke to the paper the day after the Special Immigration Appeals Commission began hearing her case as her lawyers launched a bid to bring her back to Britain.\n\nDuring the four day hearing Mrs Justice Elisabeth Laing is expected to deal with, among other things, whether depriving Begum of her British citizenship rendered her stateless and was therefore unlawful.\n\nIndividuals appealing to SIAC usually remain anonymous, however it is understood that Begum has waived her right to anonymity.\n\nBegum told The Times: 'I feel the only way I could have a normal life is to go back to the UK, it\u2019s the only real option I have.'\n\nFormer Met Chief Superintendent Del Dabu said that Britain has an 'international duty to give her the chance to come back to country and brought through the criminal process.\n\nHe said: 'We have a responsibility as she was groomed on our watch.\n\n'We have to take responsibility for young girl's who were groomed and influenced on our watch.'\n\nBegum, then aged 15, was one of three schoolgirls - along with Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase - from Bethnal Green Academy who left their homes and families in February 2015 to join a fourth Bethnal Green schoolgirl, Sharmeena Begum, who had left London in 2014, in Syria.\n\nIn February, Begum was found by The Times, nine months pregnant, at a refugee camp, telling the paper that she would 'do anything required just to be able to come home'.\n\nBegum said she was married 10 days after arriving in Raqqa to a Dutchman who had converted to Islam, Yago Riedijk, who she claimed was later arrested, charged with spying and tortured.\n\nShamima in an undated photo from police\n\nShe eventually left Raqqa in January 2017 with her husband but her children, a girl aged a year and nine months old and a three-month-old boy, both died.\n\nHer third child, a son, also died shortly after he was born.\n\nRiedijk, a 27-year-old jihadist from the Netherlands, has been placed on an exclusion list and is currently being held in a cell in northern Syria.\n\nHe has been banned from entering Britain because he poses a national security risk.\n\nRiedijk was jailed for six years in his absence last year in his home country the Netherlands for membership of a terrorist organisation.\n\nHe has spoken about his love for his wife in an interview with The Times. He said: 'We got very close very quickly. The perfect wife. She was so young and innocent'.\n\nBegum told The Times she had 'mostly' lived a 'normal life in Raqqa, every now and then bombing and stuff'.\n\nShe added: 'But when I saw my first severed head in a bin it didn't faze me at all. It was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam. I thought only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance.'\n\nThe Home Office revoked her British citizenship later in February - a decision which is only lawful if it did not leave Begum stateless.\n\nIt was speculated at the time that Begum may have Bangladeshi citizenship, but Bangladesh's minister of state for foreign affairs Shahriar Alam has denied this.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel told The Sun last month that Begum would not be able to return to the UK, telling the paper: 'Our job is to keep our country safe.\n\n'We don't need people who have done harm and left our country to be part of a death cult and to perpetrate that ideology.\n\n'We cannot have people who would do us harm allowed to enter our country - and that includes this woman.\n\n'Everything I see in terms of security and intelligence, I am simply not willing to allow anybody who has been an active supporter or campaigner for IS in this country.'\n\nLast month Begum begged to come back to the UK to get therapy after saying she now hates the Islamic State (IS).\n\nSince being part of IS she says she has given birth to three children, all of whom died from disease or malnutrition.\n\nMs Patel responded to her plea by simply saying: 'No way, no way.'\n\nBegum said: 'My mental health situation is not the best.\n\n'My physical health is OK. I am still young and I do not get sick. That is not my problem. Mentally, though, I am in a really bad way. I need therapy to deal with my grief. It is so hard. I have lost all my children.\n\n'None of the people I am living with in here know what I have experienced. They are not like my school friends who I could always talk to. They do not understand what I have been through.'", "description": "Shamima Begum, 19, is living nine miles from the border at al-Roj camp within Turkey's 'safe zone' which they began pounding with artillery earlier this month.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson", "Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/02/20015494-0-image-a-49_1571966107028.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
