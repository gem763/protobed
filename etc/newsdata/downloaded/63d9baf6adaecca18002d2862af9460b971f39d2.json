The front-month November contract was at $64.77 a barrel, up 37 cents, by 0650 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ( ) were up 55 cents to $58.68 a barrel, set to post a 7.1% gain for the week, the largest weekly rise since June.\n\n\"The forward curve remains 'bid' as traders are hedging that the initial estimates for the duration of repairs (at damaged Saudi facilities), given the complex nature, could well underestimate the time required,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nSaudi Arabia's production dropped by almost half after an attack on Saturday, Sept. 14, crippled a major oil processing facility. Its oil minister has pledged to restore lost production by the end of this month, and bring capacity back to 12 million barrels per day by the end of November.\n\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia blame Iran for the assault on Saudi oil facilities. Tehran denies any involvement.\n\nIn the United States, meanwhile, torrential rain from Tropical Storm Imelda has forced a major refinery to cut production and to shut a key oil pipeline, terminals and a ship channel in Texas.\n\nGlobal markets are also keeping an eye on U.S.-China trade negotiations in Washington, as officials from both sides resumed face-to-face talks for the first time in nearly two months on Thursday.", "description": "Tensions in Middle East hoist oil prices to largest weekly gain for months", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8J05T_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
