Three of my favourite books of 2019 missed the cut \u2013 Max Porter\u2019s Lanny, Deborah Levy\u2019s The Man Who Saw Everything and John Lanchester\u2019s The Wall \u2013 but once I\u2019d stopped my indignant spluttering, I recognised that it was still a shortlist worth celebrating. And, perhaps, also worth putting a tenner on, given that the prize is notoriously just \u201cposh bingo\u201d. I got last year badly wrong (my money was on Everything Under by Daisy Johnson), but I have a half-decent record otherwise, with bets on Marlon James, Richard Flanagan and George Saunders covering at least the cost of a new dinner jacket to wear to this year\u2019s ceremony at London\u2019s Guildhall.\n\nClear favourite with the bookies is Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, at 2/1. Atwood makes a stunning return to the world of her classic The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which was shortlisted for the 1986 prize but lost out to Kingsley Amis\u2019s The Old Devils. You\u2019d have to have been living in Gilead to have missed the fanfare surrounding The Testaments, a subtle, moral novel that is both a clear response to the urgency of the political moment and an attempt to reach beyond the headlines. Here we\u2019re presented with the second generation of handmaids, with the narrative split among three women, each of whom provides a different perspective on the patriarchal totalitarianism of Gilead.\n\nA novel that makes you question whether it should strictly be called a novel is by default a good thing\n\nNext up, at 7/2, is Chigozie Obioma\u2019s second novel, An Orchestra of Minorities. His debut, The Fishermen, was shortlisted for the prize in 2015. His follow-up is longer, more complex and better than that first book, and is a contemporary retelling of Homer\u2019s Odyssey narrated by the spirit of a chicken farmer. Obioma intertwines classical mythology with Nigerian folklore, but this is above all a love story, in which the genial Chinonso sets out to win the hand of the high-born Ndali, and his voyage is every bit as epic and perilous as that of his Greek predecessor. Obioma\u2019s expansive, tragic, multilingual novel \u2013 it steps between English, Igbo and Nigerian pidgin \u2013 is a magnificent achievement.\n\nAt 5/1 is Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other. Another multi-perspective novel, this one tells the story of 12 black British women (although each of those terms are radically interrogated by the book). Their narratives are interwoven, intimate, rendered in fluid sentences of lyrical prose that often feel more like poetry. I was often reminded of great documentary historians such as Tony Parker and Studs Terkel \u2013 the lives presented here leap off the page, building into a tapestry that is at once moving and funny, deceptively simple and yet a powerful commentary on the state of our divided nation, taking in issues of race, gender identity, migration and colonialism. A novel that makes you question whether it should strictly be called a novel is by default a good thing \u2013 this is a book that pushes at the limits of the genre and leaves you feeling lucky to have spent time in the presence of a writer of such warm-hearted wisdom.\n\nTwitter has had great fun quoting my review of Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport (6/1) back to me. I said that \u201c98% of those who pick it up will think it unspeakable guff\u201d, a comment I stand by, notwithstanding her shortlisting. The trolls don\u2019t quote the latter parts of my review, in which I state that \u201cthe 2% who get it will really get it\u201d and \u201cthis is a novel that rewards perseverance, is truly unique, and feels like an absence in your life when you finish it\u201d. Most reviewers have picked up on the fact that Ellmann is the daughter of the Joyce scholar Richard Ellmann. More pertinent, I think, is the fact that her mother, Mary, was a brilliant but now almost forgotten feminist theorist, whose Thinking About Women is an unjustly overlooked classic. Ducks, Newburyport is the 1,020-page, eight-sentence memoir of an Ohio housewife, occasionally interrupted by passages from the perspective of a mountain lion. Sounds peculiar? Yup. But I loved it, and I\u2019ve never felt quite so haunted by a book after finishing it. Her mother would be proud.\n\nHow to write a Booker contender \u2013 by Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and others Read more\n\nIan McEwan famously won the Booker for his worst novel, Amsterdam. I\u2019m not sure that 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World (also at 6/1) is Elif Shafak\u2019s worst book, but it\u2019s not her best, or at least while reading it I kept finding myself thinking back to previous novels \u2013 The Architect\u2019s Apprentice and Honour in particular \u2013 which would have been far more worthy winners. This is the tale of Tequila Leila, a prostitute left for dead who, in the last 10-and-a-half minutes of her life, recalls an existence of horrifying brutality and exploitation, but also of beauty and grace. Shafak is a powerful force for good in the world and a writer of extraordinary gifts, but this one left me cold.\n\nA few weeks ago, 1981 winner Salman Rushdie\u2019s Quichotte was an even-odds favourite. It\u2019s now a 12/1 outsider. We\u2019re not saying that there have been loose lips from one of the judging panel, but it seems a precipitous fall from grace for a splendid novel. Even the bad reviews of this exuberant rewriting of Cervantes (and with Rushdie there\u2019s always a hatchet job or two) couldn\u2019t mask the sheer fun of it, the carnival of ideas that swirl around his 14th novel. While many have focused on the metafictive cleverness of the book (and it does occasionally feel a little pleased with its postmodern flourishes), it\u2019s the generous capaciousness that wins the reader over. A book ostensibly about Sam DuChamp and his dreams of literary stardom turns into a book about Ismail Smile\u2019s unlikely quest to win the heart of Salma R, but the novel is really about the art of storytelling in the information age; it\u2019s a book about the undying necessity of books.\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult year to call a winner, given the political backdrop and its necessary impact on the judges\u2019 decision. It would be easy to see Atwood or Ellmann winning in the age of #MeToo, or Shafak as a snub to the boorish autocrat Erdo\u011fan. Easy, also, to make a case for the vibrantly global voices of past (Rushdie) or present (Obioma). My money, though, is on Evaristo. Her book was the last of the shortlist I read, but it not only exceeded my expectations, it felt like a novel that did what all great novels do, dropping the reader deeply into richly imagined lives, recognising that in the intimate presentation of the particular lies the universal, and making a convincing case that the best novels push the genre in exciting new directions.\n\n\u2022 Get all six books shortlisted for the Booker prize for \u00a375 (saving \u00a39.44).
