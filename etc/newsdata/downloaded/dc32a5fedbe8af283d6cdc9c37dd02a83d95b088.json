Over 1.2 million copies of the book has been printed so far and the rights have been sold to 16 countries.\n\nA film based on the novel starring Jung Yu-mi and Gong Yoo is set for release next week, giving sales a fresh fillip.\n\nThe Japanese edition, which was released in December last year, has sold more than 140,000 copies.\n\n", "description": "Korean Feminist Novel Proves Hit in China", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/18/2019101801473_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
