She was very upset and I've never actually been through anything like that.\n\n'I've had people place packages in the wrong area or throw it over the gate and it breaking, but I've never actually been through someone disrespecting me, my home and my packages in that manner.\n\n'I guess she was upset about the fact that I put the note on there. As you can see in the video she was cursing, she was mad and she flicked my camera off.\n\n'I clicked on the notification link and watched her as she did it, and I was like 'this is unbelievable'.\n\nAs she walks away after delivering the package, she appears to be 'flipping the bird'\n\n'I guess she just took it personally but it had nothing to do with her - I don't know her who she is.\n\nFormer Amazon delivery driver Chris Smith posted the footage on social media saying he was shocked at the driver's unprofessional behavior\n\n'I never know who is delivering my packages because different drivers get different routes every day so it was nothing personal.\n\n'It's their job as Amazon delivery drivers to not be disrespectful and to not take anything that's been said personally.\n\n'I think her reaction to my note was very disrespectful, uncalled for, and unprofessional.'\n\nThe former Amazon delivery driver said during his time working for the company he received 'frustrating' notes from customers but always acted professionally.\n\nHe said: 'The notes could be a little frustrating because I had customers who would put very vulgar information in the notes - and one customer would actually curse.\n\n'It was nothing personal towards me because he didn't know exactly who I am, but at the same time, if a customer is frustrated what can we do about that?\n\n'If a customer puts something in their notes that we particularly don't like, we can't be disrespectful - we're still on the job.'\n\nAn Amazon spokesman said: 'This does not reflect the high standards we have for our delivery partners.\n\n'The driver will no longer be delivering on behalf of Amazon.'", "description": "The shocking footage was filmed in Houston, Texas.
