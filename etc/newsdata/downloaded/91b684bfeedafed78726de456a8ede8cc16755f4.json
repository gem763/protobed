The path to it starts at a car park on the A82, crosses the glen and River Coe, then starts to ascend. After a nerve-racking narrow stretch above a gorge, the route continues, curving round boulders and crossing the river again via stepping stones. Then, there it is \u2013 the Lost Valley or Coire Gabhail, hemmed in by the steep sides of two ridges. Three hundred years ago it made the perfect hiding place for the Macdonald clan\u2019s rustled cattle (its Gaelic name means the Hollow of the Capture). Today, it\u2019s an idyllic spot for walkers and wild campers \u2013 we could just make out a tent on the valley floor.\n\nA couple who had passed us earlier, one carrying skis, the other a snowboard, were long gone, presumably up on one of the just-visible patches of snow. Shafts of hazy sunlight shone on the valley floor. In a film the scene would have been set to rousing music.\n\nInstead the silence was broken by the persistent buzz of a drone operated by a dad as his teenage daughter sat on a rock staring intently at her phone. Not that I\u2019m judging. We had our own reluctant walker \u2013 our nine-year son, Ossian.\n\n\u201cI hate this,\u201d he\u2019d screamed into the wind as we tackled the Devil\u2019s Staircase two days earlier. The route zigzags up the north side of the glen to the highest point of the 96-mile West Highland Way, with views of the Mamores mountains further north. To the east is Aonoch Eagach, the UK\u2019s most exposed ridge walk, just 45cm at its narrowest point. The Devil\u2019s Staircase is so called because some of the men building the nearby Blackwater dam in 1909 didn\u2019t make it home after a night drinking in the Kingshouse Hotel \u2013 the devil \u201cclaimed them\u201d as they staggered back over the pass in the dark.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Kingshouse Hotel, with Buachaille Etive M\u00f2r to the right and the original 18th-century hotel to the left.

The \u00a312m building was roundly criticised by the National Trust, the John Muir Trust and Mountaineering Scotland for not blending in with its surroundings. The design, they said, was too industrial; the John Muir Trust called it a \u201cbarracks-style block.\u201d\n\nWhich is a bit harsh. The design may not be classic Highlands \u2013 the Clachaig Inn down the road offers that \u2013 but it\u2019s no blot on the landscape. Big windows in the bar and restaurant make the most of the majestic setting, with views of one of Scotland\u2019s most recognisable mountains, the pyramidal Buachaille Etive M\u00f2r. The bar saw a steady flow of weary walkers who\u2019d just crossed the desolate expanse of Rannoch Moor on stage six of the West Highland Way, and the restaurant menu caters to hikers\u2019 appetites. Starters of game broth or double-baked mull cheddar souffl\u00e9 were followed by estate-reared venison or rump of Argyll lamb, with a hot toddy cheesecake to round it off.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A room at the Kingshouse Hotel.

Hulking peaks loom on either side, and fault lines look like a giant claw has slashed the mountainsides from top to bottom. It\u2019s nature at its most forbidding.\n\nThe 1692 Glen Coe massacre \u2013 when soldiers loyal to William III of England and led by general Robert Campbell turned on the Macdonalds \u2013 is remembered in a film at the revamped National Trust visitor centre, and more bluntly at the entrance to the Clachaig Inn, where a sign reads, \u201cNo Hawkers and no Campbells.\u201d\n\nThe Clachaig is a whitewashed hotel and pub that stocks 365 malt whiskies, 100 Scottish gins and a roster of craft ales, cider and stouts. The walls are decorated with old ice picks, and we can imagine the tales of climbing feats and woes that must have been told here over the years. The bedrooms are smaller and not as smart as those at Kingshouse, but the setting is every bit as stunning.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The ice climbing wall at the Ice Factor in Kinlochleven. Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Alamy\n\nTravelling to Fort William on the Caledonian Sleeper (which launches its new carriages on the Highland route on 13 October) is like watching a trailer for a film \u2013 the scenery rolling past provides glimpses of the drama ahead \u2013 but nothing quite prepares you for standing in the midst of it. There were moments when the landscape was so wild and vast it felt unreal. Yet even here, overtourism is an issue. Coaches clog the A82 and fill the car parks with passengers doing \u201cScotland in a day\u201d \u2013 which is madness given how much there is to explore and how many walks are waiting to be tackled (Walking Highlands lists 33 in Glen Coe and Kinlochleven alone).\n\nBut walking isn\u2019t the only activity on offer. This area of north-west Scotland is one of the adventure capitals of the UK. On day two of our trip, we drove the short distance from the Kingshouse Hotel to the Glencoe Mountain ski resort. Opened in 1956, Glencoe Mountain is the oldest but smallest of Scotland\u2019s five ski resorts, with seven lifts (eight from this winter) serving 20 runs on Meall a\u2019Bhuiridh mountain, including the UK\u2019s steepest black run, the Flypaper. If you\u2019re not there in winter for the skiing \u2013 and conditions can be variable even then \u2013 you can use the lifts to access mountain bike trails for all abilities (May until end of October). Unfortunately, our attempt to ski was scuppered by rain so we headed to the cafe for a hot chocolate.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Walkers on the West Highland Way crossing Rannoch Mor close to the head of Glen Coe.

Too young to tackle the ice, Ossian had a lesson on the rock climbing wall (\u00a324) while my partner and I practised swinging a pick into the pocked ice face above our heads and hauling ourselves up (also \u00a324). It was slow, hard work but I imagine graduating from this giant freezer to a frozen waterfall is thrilling.\n\nAfter the climbing centre we drove along the north side of Loch Leven to the seafood cafe of the same name and ordered oysters, Loch Linnhe langoustines and spaghetti with local clams. The 13-mile trail around the loch offers an alternative for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to tackle a mountainside. On the southern shore of the loch you pass Eilean a\u2019 Chombraidh, or the \u2018Isle of Discussion\u2019, where members of the Macdonald clan were sent to settle arguments. Apparently they were dispatched with a supply of cheese, oatcakes and whisky to ease discussions.\n\nOn our final day we headed to the Nevis Range Mountain Experience just north of Fort William to try mountain biking. There we met local biking talent Louise Ferguson, who showed immense patience with our slow progress along a gentle forest trail (\u00a345pp). It was Ossian\u2019s first experience of cycling on rough terrain and he found it challenging. But he absolutely loved the next activity, the Tree Adventure course in nearby Leanachan forest (adult \u00a327.50, child \u00a317.50). He happily leapt off an 11-metre high platform for the finale, whereas I had to do the climb of shame back down when I bottled it at the top.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mountain biking with Nevis Range Mountain Experience.\n\nStill, onwards and upwards \u2013 literally, as we boarded the gondola up Britain\u2019s ninth-highest mountain, Aonach M\u00f2r (from \u00a315). The view from the top is of mile upon mile of rugged peaks, as far as the summit of Askival on the Isle of Rum on a clear day.\n\nWe had packed a lot into just five days, but from the top of Aonach M\u00f2r it was clear that this wildly beautiful landscape offers a lifetime of adventure.\n\n\u2022 The trip was provided by Visit Scotland. Doubles at the Kingshouse Hotel start at \u00a3125 BB or \u00a335pp in the bunkhouse. Rooms at the Clachaig Inn start at \u00a3132 B&B. Train travel was provided by Caledonian Sleeper; classic rooms cost from \u00a3140 one-way (solo) or \u00a3170 (shared)\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
