Rock-stacking stirs debate", "language": "en", "text": "DULUTH, Minn. (AP) - To some along the north shoreline of Lake Superior in Minnesota, building stacks of rocks, or cairns, is akin to making sand castles and can even be meditative. To others, these manmade rock formations despoil nature\u2019s beauty and stand as monuments to the human ego.\n\nThose who live along the north shore say cairns began appearing more often about five years ago, possibly because of the growth in popularity of Instagram and other social media sites, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.\n\nPhotographer Travis Novitsky, who grew up and still lives on the Grand Portage Reservation, where the shoreline extends north into Canada, said he wasn\u2019t bothered by cairns at first, but that he now sees them all along the lakefront.\n\n\u201cI see it as a big detractor to stepping out on the shoreline, where you\u2019re expecting to see \u2026 an untouched piece of shoreline,\u201d he said.\n\nThe debate over stacking rocks isn\u2019t unique to the Minnesota shoreline - it has raged everywhere from Zion National Park in Utah to Acadia National Park in Maine. And although Minnesota Department of Natural Resources officials said the agency wouldn\u2019t consider building cairns a violation of state park rules, signs forbidding stacking have been placed on some beaches out West, MPR News reported.\n\nWhen friends Stacey Fox and Anna Bennett visited Iona\u2019s Beach between Gooseberry Falls and Split Rock Lighthouse state parks last summer, they found several delicately balanced cairns. Fox posted a photo of them on a Facebook group dedicated to the north shore, but it was quickly removed. Bennett asked why, not realizing she had waded into a fierce debate about cairns.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, the controversy on there was unbelievable,\u201d she recalled. \u201cSaying that it was wrecking the ecosystem, and can even endanger species of wildlife. I was like, \u2018What in the world?\u2019 I never even knew there was any controversy at all until that post.\u201d\n\nBruce Holmen, one of the administrators of the North Shore Tribe Facebook group, said the amount of vitriol over the issue led the group to change its policy a few years ago and require all posts to get approval before they can go up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous. Why would that topic elicit that much emotion by either side?\u201d he asked.\n\nKurt Mead, an interpretive naturalist at Tettegouche State Park, said many park staffers don\u2019t like the cairns and tend to kick them over, finding them to be an eyesore that despoils the scenery for those who come after they\u2019re built. It\u2019s not just the aesthetics, though, as he said rock stacks can also cause ecological harm in rivers, where stones provide habitat for macroinvertebrates that form the bottom of the food chain.\n\nPeter Juhl, an airline database administrator, said he\u2019s been balancing rocks for a quarter-century, mainly along the north shore. He said it\u2019s a meditative process for him and he considers his stacks, where the rocks seem to be balanced at impossible angles, to be ephemeral works of art. Although he encourages others to try their hand at stacking, he urges them to do so responsibly and to deconstruct their works after taking a photo of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not owned by me, and other people use it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I want to be kind to the beach, and kind to the people who come later.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Minnesota Public Radio News, http://www.mprnews.org\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "To some along the north shoreline of Lake Superior in Minnesota, building stacks of rocks, or cairns, is akin to making sand castles and can even be meditative.
