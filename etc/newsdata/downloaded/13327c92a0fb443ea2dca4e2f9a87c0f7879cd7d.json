The new feature will be available to all tiers of Pandora users, not just premium ones, and it will include everything from who played the keyboards to who contributed audio engineering to who helped pen the lyrics or compose the melody.\n\nPandora is positioning the feature specifically as a remedy to one of the pitfalls of the streaming era, where music\u2019s digitization and effectively free availability across the internet can often downplay just how many artists, engineers, musicians, and other talented professionals contributed to a track.\n\n\u201cMusic\u2019s physical-to-digital evolution has given rise to an era of unprecedented music discovery, but it has sometimes made it difficult to find the kind of credits and information that used to live on LP sleeves and CD inserts. Who wrote that song? Who played the instruments? Who produced the beat and arranged the strings?\u201d the company writes in a blog post. \u201cWe believe in giving credit where it\u2019s due.\u201d\n\nRight now, the full song credits feature is not searchable; instead, it\u2019s static information supplied from a database that\u2019s compiled using information music labels and distributors have provided. That means you won\u2019t be able to search for, say, the drummer on a Taylor Swift song and find out what other tracks that performer has contributed to. But it is much more information than what was displayed before, which was restricted mostly to lyrics, cover art, and the song features that Pandora\u2019s Music Genome Project uses for curation and personalization.\n\nAnother bit of important context for this new feature is current pop queen Lizzo\u2019s songwriting dispute over her record-breaking chart topper \u201cTruth Hurts.\u201d The artist just yesterday filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against two former collaborators to establish in court that they had no part in creating the song, after the men \u2014 brothers Justin and Jeremiah Raisen \u2014 said they worked on \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d and deserve credit. With songwriting credits comes a portion of royalties.\n\nBut as part of her legal defense, Lizzo added British singer Mina Lioness to the songwriting credits after using a phrase in a viral tweet of Lioness\u2019 as a now-iconic line in \u201cTruth Hurts.\u201d The line is, \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch,\u201d and Lizzo has openly cited Lioness as the direct inspiration after turning \u201c100% that bitch\u201d into a trademark, t-shirts and all.\n\nI did a DNA test and found out I'm 100% that bitch. \u2014 Legendina (@MinaLioness) February 25, 2017\n\nI just took a DNA Test, turns out I\u2019m a credited writer for the number one song on Billboard. \u2014 Legendina (@MinaLioness) October 23, 2019\n\nIt marks perhaps the first time a song lyric has ever transitioned from a tweet to a pop hit and earned the initial author a songwriting credit. And it just goes to show you that songwriting these days is as collaborative as it\u2019s always been \u2014 something Pandora wants its full song credit feature to emphasize \u2014 even if the process now involves public meme-sharing.", "description": "Pandora today announced it will display full song credits for millions of songs on its desktop app and on the web.
