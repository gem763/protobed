For Trump, the news worsens an already precarious electoral situation.\n\nFaced with slumping crop prices, declining manufacturing and anemic domestic growth, Trump hopes Americans will be wowed by the 130,000 new jobs added in August. Look closer and you\u2019ll see the cracks in the plaster.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHidden in the data is the fact that nearly 30,000 of those new jobs are temporary positions created to assist the US Census. That means the American economy created only 100,000 private sector jobs last month, well below the three-month average of 190,000. That disappointing number comes after sharp downward revisions to job growth numbers for June and July.\n\nMost of that job growth came at the lower-paid end of the service sector. The data show these aren\u2019t the plum positions the Trump administration would have Americans believe \u2013 and Trump\u2019s own labor researchers are now cautioning that these jobs may not be enough to keep budget-strapped American families afloat.\n\nAccording to a recent study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 7 in 10 of the next decade\u2019s fastest-growing job sectors will pay employees at or near the national poverty line. This includes personal care aides ($24,000 annually), restaurant cooks ($26,530), medical assistants (33,610), waiters ($21,780) and janitors ($26,110).\n\nManufacturing added only about 4,000 new manufacturing jobs in August. The mining and coal sector, whose beleaguered voters played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral victory, lost 2,000 jobs. That\u2019s hardly in line with Trump\u2019s pledge to bring tens of thousands of coal jobs back to declining Rust Belt communities.\n\nWorking class wages have also stagnated, hovering at between 2 to 3 per cent annual growth for the past decade \u2013 during which time corporate profits and C-suite compensation packages have grown hundreds of times over. Toss on the added weight of rising healthcare costs and you\u2019ve created a recipe for electoral peril.\n\nAdding to Trump\u2019s economic woes, the manufacturing industry slid into recession this quarter after a major contraction largely due to a spiraling trade standoff with China. The recovery of American manufacturing has been a cornerstone of the Trump campaign since his earliest public outings. The August jobs report offers little optimism for a manufacturing comeback.\n\nFederal Reserve modeling warns that time may be running out for the longest economic expansion in American history. On September 3, the Atlanta Federal Reserve reduced its estimate for third quarter GDP growth to an anemic 1.7 per cent. That\u2019s a sharp downward slope from the ho-hum 2 per cent figure the Atlanta Fed predicted less than a week ago.\n\nDonald Trump doesn\u2019t bear all the blame for America\u2019s economic dysfunction. Wages stagnated long before he emerged as a political entity. Healthcare costs have been rising since the Nixon administration. But Trump does deserve criticism for worsening already acute economic problems with short-sighted spending decisions and his ruinous trade standoff with the China.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is prepared to lower interest rates three more times in the coming year as America fights off growing global economic headwinds. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that, absent an unexpected burst of global growth, the United States may soon face negative interest rates similar to those bedeviling European governments. No one is certain those steps will be enough.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The Democrat challengers to Trump in 2020 Show all 22 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Trump will almost certainly fabricate excuses for the uneven growth in wages and job opportunities, especially among his core demographics. But institutional investors and world governments see through such misdirections. There are growing signs the struggling workers that make up Trump\u2019s unique political base are starting to see through them, too.\n\nIf the economy veers into full-on recession early next year, as over a third of institutional investors predict, the downturn could take Trump with it in 2020.\n\nMax Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and senior contributor at Millennial Politics.
