Any player would gladly celebrate with those shiny centerpieces, though O\u2019Reilly - at 28 and on his third team - is only now showing he is this kind of elite player.\n\n\u201cI still think I have another gear to get to, and that\u2019s my plan,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cThere\u2019s still many things to improve on. There are areas to be better. One thing, too, is I think power-play production for myself could\u2019ve been a lot better, and that\u2019s an area I need to grow. There\u2019s some stuff I\u2019ve been working on to try to improve that.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly had nine points in the Cup Final against Boston playing through a cracked rib. He was nearly a point-a-game player during the regular season. Yet, somehow he still seemed underappreciated outside his peers.\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t realize how good of a player Ryan O\u2019Reilly was until this year,\u201d Vancouver forward Bo Horvat said. \u201cAll the players knew how good he was and how big of a part of that team he was and how special of a player - just his two-way game, his faceoffs. Obviously his point production this year was outstanding. His play in the playoffs, winning MVP and obviously the Stanley Cup, it was a great year for him and I think he opened up a lot of eyes.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he figured something out during the playoffs: how to clear out some \u201cgarbage\u201d in his brain to focus on what matters. The challenge now is trying to duplicate that during an 82-game regular season.\n\n\u201cJust go out there and completely be in the moment and go from there,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big lesson for myself, trying to establish that more. Be clear and find a way to take all the noise and all the stuff that you don\u2019t need in your head and just throw it out. It just seems like when I did that, I tend to get more bounces and things went my way.\u201d\n\nWinning the Selke was evidence enough of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s strong regular season. He ranked eighth in the league in faceoffs, which is part of what makes him so tough to play against.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just so competitive on draws,\u201d Chicago captain Jonathan Toews said. \u201cI\u2019m one of those guys I want to start every shift with the puck and if we\u2019re going up against a guy like that that could catch fire, and we might be chasing it down for a whole period. He\u2019s obviously not one of the fastest guys out there, but he\u2019s so good positionally and just aware of where guys are and what to do with the puck. I think he\u2019s just an all-around super intelligent player.\u201d\n\nNATHAN MACKINNON\n\nAlready considered one of the fastest hockey players on earth, MacKinnon carried the Colorado Avalanche to within one victory of the Western Conference final and is the biggest reason they\u2019re a fashionable Cup contender this season. Fellow Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, native Sidney Crosby said MacKinnon is in the category of Pittsburgh teammate Evgeni Malkin and Edmonton star Connor McDavid as players who can take over games.\n\n\u201cWe saw a pretty good glimpse of that in the playoffs,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cHe did it consistently. \u2026 I\u2019d expect him to take another big step.\u201d\n\nRookie Avalanche defenseman Cale Makar said it\u2019s electrifying to watch MacKinnon on the ice. And the 24-year-old center is an example to his younger teammates and those around the league.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a super committed guy,\u201d Makar said. \u201cHe loves hockey, and that\u2019s the way he plays. It shows on the ice. Just the way he handles his routine is very specific and you just learn from star players like that.\u201d\n\nHENRIK LUNDQVIST\n\n\u201cThe King\u201d is 37, yet could be the difference between the New York Rangers missing the playoffs for a third consecutive season or contending ahead of schedule. The longtime starting goaltender isn\u2019t fazed by young backup Alexandar Georgiev and top prospect Igor Shesterkin looming in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\u201cMy approach will not change,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201cI need to reach my top level no matter what, no matter who\u2019s next to me or where the team is at.\u201d\n\nLundqvist said the start of last season was the best he had felt in a while. He posted a 2.68 goals-against average and .919 save percentage in his first 22 starts last season, which would be great for an improved Rangers team with a better blue line and more firepower up front.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the level I just need to reach and sustain throughout the year, and then I know I can make a difference,\u201d Lundqvist said.\n\nALEX OVECHKIN\n\nThe release of \u201cOvi O\u2019s\u201d cereal marked his 34th birthday. If anyone has shown age is just a number, it\u2019s Ovechkin, who is now the Washington Capitals\u2019 oldest player and still could score 50 goals. Even though Ovechkin said he\u2019s \u201cnot a grandpa\u201d and trained differently this summer, don\u2019t expect him to alter his style too much.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still young, you know,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cI still want to play my game. \u2026 We\u2019re here for 25 minutes or whatever it is - I just want to be here to win, whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nOvechkin preceded O\u2019Reilly as playoff MVP when he led the Capitals to the first title in franchise history in 2018. After a full summer off, he is refreshed to try to do it again.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously a different talent,\u201d Washington winger Carl Hagelin said. \u201cA guy like that doesn\u2019t come around very often. He\u2019s one of those energetic guys even though he\u2019s 33, 34 years old. He comes to the rink with a smile every day. He does what he has to do.\u201d\n\nMARK STONE\n\nThere may not be a more complete winger in the NHL than Stone, who put up 12 points in the Vegas Golden Knights\u2019 seven-game first-round series against San Jose. Stone is free of Ottawa\u2019s long-term rebuild and starting a $76 million, eight-year contract with big expectations to help Vegas make another long playoff run.\n\n\u201cYou get a No. 1 forward,\u201d Golden Knights forward Jonathan Marchessault said. \u201cHe\u2019s an unbelievable player. He does everything well on the ice. He puts up great numbers every year, and he\u2019s a successful player.\u201d\n\nVegas is one of several NHL teams without a captain. That might not last long with Stone in the fold.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a guy that\u2019s trying to be a leader,\u201d Marchessault said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a born leader, so it\u2019s just natural for him.\u201d\n\nRASMUS DAHLIN\n\nThe 2018 No. 1 pick had 44 points to lead all rookie defenseman. It was just the floor for where Dahlin wants to start.\n\n\u201cOf course I want to score more goals, have more assists and stuff like that,\u201d Dahlin said. \u201cLast season, I had more points than I expected, but this year, I always want more. That\u2019s why I play.\u201d\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres are counting on that in their first season under coach Ralph Krueger. Captain Jack Eichel has big expectations for Dahlin, who he believes \u201clived up to all the hype.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look at how good he was last year in year one and how much more he knows now,\u201d Eichel said. \u201cI think he\u2019s primed to have a monster season.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ryan O'Reilly stockpiled quite the hardware to show off at his Stanley Cup day.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/sabres_penguins_hockey_08177_c0-524-3636-2643_s1770x1032.jpg?08f60d8e0860f5d6e01ea01adb352840c56de962", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
