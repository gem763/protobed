It appears China took notice and will now push towards the massive development and implementation of blockchain solutions across the region.\n\nEven though China\u2019s blockchain strategy will be based on a permissioned framework that\u2019s basically centralized, the adoption of the technology will be a major deal for the community.\n\nWith the announcement of a new Cryptography Law passed in China, changes are bound to happen. While China still banned cryptocurrencies and trading, the technology underneath it could be key to China\u2019s blockchain strategy. The new law will provide a regulatory framework for commercial cryptography use-cases, as the country expects those will eventually become an important part of the economy. The new law aims to encourage developers and researchers to improve commercial cryptography technologies. According to the document:\n\nClear guidelines and regulations are needed to evaluate commercial cryptography technologies used in the major fields related to the national interest as the current \u2018loose\u2019 system is not suitable for the industry anymore.\n\nIt looks like countries have now replaced the Space Race for a Technology Race, a competition where whoever implements the most resources into the development of new technologies will definitely win. The Libra coin opened up the gates for countries to begin thinking outside the box, and while countries like the U.S. are trying every single way to block this proposal from happening, other countries are seizing the opportunity to develop their own blockchain-based solution to provide an optimized financial system.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cryptocoin.News Is The Central News Source For Information On Cryptocurrencies.
