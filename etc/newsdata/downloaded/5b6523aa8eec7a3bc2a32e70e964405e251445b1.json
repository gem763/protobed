The attack deployed 10 drones, the Houthis said.\n\n\n\nBut U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran for the attacks.\n\n\"Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy,\" Pompeo wrote on Twitter. \"Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\"\n\nThe White House said President Donald Trump spoke with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to offer U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's defense.\n\n\"Violent actions against civilian areas and infrastructure vital to the global economy only deepen conflict and mistrust. The United States Government is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied,\" the White House said.\n\nThe Saudi interior ministry said investigations into the terrorist attack are ongoing.\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Salman said the kingdom will compensate part of the production to its customers from its reserves.\n\n\"This is a big deal,\" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. \"Fearing the worst, I expect that the market will open up $5 to $10 per barrel on Sunday evening. This is 12 to 25 cents per gallon for gasoline.\"\n\nLipow noted over four million barrels per day of Saudi oil exports go to Asia, while the U.S. imports about 600,000 barrels. The biggest importers in Asia are China at 1.3 million barrels and Japan at 1.2 million barrels.\n\nThe International Energy Agency said Saturday it is \"closely monitoring\" the situation following the drone attacks, adding markets are \"well supplied with ample commercial stocks.\"\n\nThe Houthis have been behind a series of attacks on Saudi pipelines, tankers and other infrastructure in the past few years as tensions rise among Iran and the U.S. and its partners like Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Islamic Republic, a target of U.S. sanctions for decades, has recently attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, shot down a U.S. military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected U.S. spies.\n\nThe latest attack came as Saudi Arabia moves forward to take Saudi Aramco public in a major shakeup of the kingdom's energy sector. The world's most profitable oil company is expected to be valued at more than $1.5 trillion, CNBC previously reported. Crown Prince Salman has pushed for a valuation of as much as $2 trillion.", "description": "Saudi Arabia has shut down half of its oil production after drones attacked the world's largest oil processing facility in the kingdom.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106129955-1568505046795abqaiq_20190914_1035_rgb_lrg.jpg?v=1568505155", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
