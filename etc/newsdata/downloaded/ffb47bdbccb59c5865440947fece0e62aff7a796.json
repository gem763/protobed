The athlete then reportedly commissioned her to create another painting of him in a mural at his home.\n\nOn her second day working at Brown\u2019s home, according to Sports Illustrated, the artist was kneeling while painting and turned around to see Brown naked behind her, allegedly holding a small towel over his genitals.\n\nAntonio Brown | Christian Petersen/Getty Images More\n\n\u201cI was about 40 percent done on the second day, and I\u2019m on my knees painting the bottom, and he walks up to me butt-ass naked, with a hand cloth covering his [penis] and starts having a conversation with me,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019ve been tried [by men] a lot of times, so I just kept my cool and kept painting \u2026 After that, it all ended abruptly.\u201d\n\nThe artist claims Brown paid her $2,000 for her days of work on the mural, but did not pay for the original painting he bought from the charity auction, nor another painting that the artist had brought to his house.\n\nRELATED: Antonio Brown Makes His First Touchdown with the Patriots Amid Sexual Assault Allegations\n\nOn Tuesday, Brown\u2019s attorney tweeted that the football player had \u201creviewed the sexual misconduct allegations\u201d and \u201cdenies that he ever engaged in such activities.\u201d\n\nAntonio Brown has reviewed the sexual misconduct allegations made by an unnamed artist included in a recently published Sports Illustrated article and denies that he ever engaged in such activities. There will be no further comment at this time. \u2014 Darren Heitner (@DarrenHeitner) September 16, 2019\n\nThe Sports Illustrated report also uncovered other instances of what it called \u201ca pattern of disturbing, sometimes bizarre behavior\u201d from Brown.\n\nIn one of numerous examples of this alleged behavior reported in Sports Illustrated, a doctor who took on Brown as a client has now filed a lawsuit seeking $11,500 from Brown, alleging unpaid bills.\n\nAccording to the magazine, Dr. Victor Prisk said he took his first meeting with Brown in August 2018. The athlete was allegedly three hours late to the appointment, and then passed gas multiple times in the vicinity of Prisk\u2019s face. (Video of the incident was previously obtained by TMZ.)\n\n\u201cIt seemed just childish to me,\u201d Prisk told Sports Illustrated. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor and this man is farting in my face.\u201d\n\nRELATED: What to Know About Antonio Brown Following Rape Allegation, His Trade to the Patriots\n\nAntonio Brown | Christian Petersen/Getty Images More", "description": "Antonio Brown Accused of Sexual Misconduct by Second Woman", "authors": ["Helen Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k7ec47zPZv7Al8HPdTwN0g--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/7f26f11f5f5fd5a5816ca3fd60b9dc3b", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
