At the time, only five people had been reported dead.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said after leaving the view of the camera. \u201cPeople running through the mall, so we need to see what this is.\u201d\n\nWith the mic still on, a woman can then be heard saying, \u201cGet in the car, get in the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is trash everywhere on the floor,\u201d Alvarez said of the scene inside the shopping center. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why. There are people still running.\u201d\n\nContinuing with his report despite little immediate information, the anchor called it \u201can active situation,\u201d adding that police had just arrived.\n\n\u201cWe do have officers with guns drawn who just came here through the mall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping our signal up, but we are going to be as safe as possible.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: KOSA-TV evacuates studios at Music City Mall in Odessa following reports of chaos at mall, officers with guns drawn [KOSA-TV] pic.twitter.com/JWF9jwFshZ \u2014 Matthew Keys (@MatthewKeysLive) August 31, 2019\n\nOdessa police said the white male suspect\u2019s rampage began that afternoon when a state trooper attempted to pull him over on Interstate 20 in the neighboring city of Midland for a minor traffic violation. The driver then opened fire, speeding away before hijacking a U.S. Postal Service truck in which he continued his massacre.\n\nThe alleged gunman, who was using an AR-style rifle, was finally confronted at Cinergy movie theater in Odessa, where he was killed in a shootout.\n\nThe violence comes just four weeks after a gunman killed 22 people at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart. Just one day later, another nine were shot dead in downtown Dayton, Ohio. In total, both incidents left more than 50 injured.", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re going to slip away for just for a minute,\" an anchor said. \"We don't know what's going on.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6c17953b00004900cabf8e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
