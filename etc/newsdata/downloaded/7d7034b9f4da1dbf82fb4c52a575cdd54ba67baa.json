She\u2019s not an aquatic reptile left over from the Jurassic era or a circus elephant that got in the water to bathe with her trunk aloft. If Nessie ever existed at all, she was most likely a giant eel, according to a new scientific survey of the loch.\n\nStarting with an Irish missionary\u2019s report of a monster in the River Ness in 565AD, repeated sightings in the modern era have kept Scotland\u2019s greatest myth alive. The most famous of which is a grainy photo from 1934 which appears to show the shadowy outline of a long-necked creature, bobbing on the water\u2019s surface.\n\nThe hoaxed photo of the Loch Ness monster taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Wilson.

But a new technique allows scientists to sample all the life contained within Loch Ness by gathering environmental DNA, or e-DNA as it\u2019s known. This is genetic material that\u2019s present in the cells of organisms and shed into their surrounding environment. Finding and identifying e-DNA can tell scientists what organisms are living in a habitat without them having to observe or capture them.\n\nSpeaking from Drumnadrochit, a village on the loch\u2019s western shore, scientists announced the results of their e-DNA survey of Loch Ness. The team took well over 200 one-liter samples of water from throughout the loch \u2013 including the surface and deep water \u2013 and compared them with 36 samples from five \u201cmonster-free\u201d lochs nearby. Their census provides a list of all the species that call Loch Ness home \u2013 from bacteria to plants and animals.\n\nWhat did they find?\n\nThe study detected over 500m individual organisms and 3,000 species. According to Neil Gemmill of University of Otago in New Zealand, who led the study, there are no DNA sequence matches for shark, catfish, or sturgeon. That rules out a large exotic fish in the loch.\n\nThere are DNA matches for various land-living species that you would expect to see around Loch Ness, including badgers, deer, rabbits, voles, and different birds. Sheep, cattle, and dogs appear on the record alongside humans too. This suggests that the sampling is pretty good at picking up species that would only rarely visit the water \u2013 so it should be able to detect a monster living permanently in the loch.\n\nThe most popular representation of Nessie is as a plesiosaur \u2013 an ancient long-necked marine reptile that died out alongside the dinosaurs in the last great mass extinction 65m years ago.\n\nThe most popular theory of Nessie \u2013 that she is a plesiosaur that somehow survived the mass extinction of the dinosaurs \u2013 may finally have been put to rest. Mark Witton, Author provided\n\nScottish geologist Hugh Miller discovered the first British plesiosaur bones on the Scottish Isle of Eigg in 1844. But according to Gemmill, there\u2019s \u201cnot a single reptile in our vertebrate data, and nothing that sat in the expected place that a plesiosaur [DNA] sequence might be predicted to lie \u2013 somewhere between birds and crocodilians.\u201d\n\nThe most likely candidate for Nessie that has surfaced in media reporting of the research is a giant eel. This appears to be based simply on the fact that eel DNA was detected at \u201cpretty much every location sampled\u201d in Loch Ness.\n\nPlenty of eel DNA doesn\u2019t confirm that Nessie is a giant eel \u2013 only that there are lots of eels. Scientists don\u2019t have monster DNA to compare with anything they found in the loch and so no one can say for sure if there is or isn\u2019t a monster there. But the absence of anything unusual in the DNA record of Loch Ness suggests there\u2019s nothing to get excited about \u2013 and that includes a giant eel.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Nessie?\n\nIf Nessie doesn\u2019t exist, why do eyewitness accounts of the Loch Ness Monster persist? The answer is likely to be a psychological phenomenon called \u201cexpectant attention.\u201d This happens when people who expect or want to see something are more likely to misinterpret visual cues as the thing that they expect or want to see.\n\nThis likely also happens with recently extinct animals. The last known Tasmanian tiger died in 1936 and exhaustive scientific surveys have failed to turn up any evidence that they\u2019re still out there. Even so, people often still report seeing them.\n\nStill, Gemmell acknowledges that there is uncertainty. Seals and otter \u2013 two species known to appear in the loch at least occasionally \u2013 weren\u2019t detected, while 20 percent of the DNA collected was \u201cunexplained.\u201d That\u2019s normal for an e-DNA study, but it does leave room for a monster.\n\nA YouGov poll in August 2018 found that 24 percent of Scots believe that Nessie exists.\n\nScience being science, we can never say with total confidence that there is no Loch Ness Monster. Loch\u2019s thriving tourism industry can still count on a little mystery to attract true believers. Rest easy, monster hunters. Nessie lives on.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation by Jason Gilchrist, Ecologist at Edinburgh Napier University under a Creative Commons license.
