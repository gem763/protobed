Their courage is credited with the cathedral surviving to this day.\n\nThe breathtaking tribute ties into the 80th anniversary commemorations of the Blitz this year.\n\nSt Paul\u2019s famously survived the Blitz, despite being struck by bombs on October 10 1940 and April 17 1941.\n\nIt became a symbol of British courage during the Second World War, after Herbert Mason photographed the cathedral during the Second Great Fire of London on December 29 1940.\n\nThe image shows St Paul\u2019s iconic dome emerging from the billows of smoke covering the streets of the capital. It is one of the most iconic photos taken of the devastation the Second World War wrought on home soil.\n\nThe projections include archive images of King George VI, animation and new poetry from London-based poet Keith Jarrett. Jarrett held workshops with local schoolchildren, older writers, refugees and migrants who have experienced conflict and included their thoughts in his work.\n\nJarrett said: \u2018I have drawn\u2026inspiration from the humour, the personal relationships, and the perseverance through adversity expressed through the records I have encountered.\u2019\n\nSt Paul\u2019s is one of two landmarks being commemorated in this way, with Coventry Cathedral also being lit up for three days next month to tell the city\u2019s story.\n\nCoventry Cathedral was destroyed in the Second World War, after an air raid on the October 14 1940.\n\nA new Cathedral was built, which preserved the remains of the old Cathedral and aimed to serve as a reminder of the waste of war.\n\nPoet Jane Commane, whose words will be brought to life during the display said part of her poem includes responses from people to the question \u2018what does Coventry Cathedral mean to you?\u2019", "description": "St Paul's Cathedral will be transformed by a spectacular light display which pays tribute to the people who fought to save it during the Second World War.", "authors": ["Mailonline Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/12/20125464-0-image-a-26_1571915328348.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
