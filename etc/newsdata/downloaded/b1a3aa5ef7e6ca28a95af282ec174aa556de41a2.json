Four other opioid makers also have reached settlements in recent months and will not be defendants in the trial, scheduled for federal court in Cleveland. Like most of the others, Johnson & Johnson still faces some 2,000 other lawsuits related to the nation\u2019s opioids epidemic.\n\nThe Ohio agreement calls for the company and its Janssen Pharmaceutical subsidiary to pay $10 million without admitting liability. The deal also includes provisions for the company to reimburse the counties up to $5 million for legal expenses and contribute another $5.4 million to nonprofit organizations that deal with the opioid crisis in northeastern Ohio.\n\n\u201cThe settlement allows the company to avoid the resource demands and uncertainty of a trial as it continues to seek meaningful progress in addressing the nation\u2019s opioid crisis,\u201d Johnson & Johnson said in a statement. \u201cThe company recognizes the opioid crisis is a complex public health challenge and is working collaboratively to help communities and people in need.\u201d\n\nOpioids, a class of drug that includes prescription painkillers as well as heroin and illicitly made fentanyl, have been linked to more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has sold three opioids in the U.S.: Duragesic fentanyl patches; the oral opioid Nucynta; and an extended-release version of Nucynta.\n\nThe company said its products accounted for less than 1% of the opioid prescriptions in the country since they were launched. It sold marketing rights for Nucynta in 2015 and has not marketed Duragesic to patients or prescribers in the U.S. for more than a decade, although it continues to sell the drug.\n\nIn recent months, the drug companies Endo, Allergan and Mallinckrodt also reached settlements with the two Ohio counties. Purdue Pharma has struck a tentative deal intended to settle all its lawsuits \u2014 although about half the states say they will object to the settlement in bankruptcy court.\n\nTeva is the only drugmaker that would remain in the Cleveland trial if Johnson & Johnson\u2019s settlement is finalized. The other defendants still in the trial are distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, Henry Schein and McKesson, along with the pharmacy chain Walgreens.\n\nWith most drugmakers out of the initial trial, it could mean less focus on how they marketed powerful painkillers to doctors and more on whether distributors shipped opioid orders that they believed were suspicious.\n\nWith the trial approaching, more settlements are possible. In a statement Tuesday, Endo said it \u201ccontinues to explore various global settlement mechanisms,\u201d including \u201ca construct that could potentially be implemented through Purdue Pharma\u2019s recent bankruptcy filing.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Johnson & Johnson announced it had reached an agreement worth more than $20 million with Cuyahoga and Summit counties, in Ohio", "authors": ["Geoff Mulvihill"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/johnson-and-johnson-ohio-counties-settlement-opioids.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
