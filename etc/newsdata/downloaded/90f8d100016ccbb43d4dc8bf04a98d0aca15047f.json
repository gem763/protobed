Creator and director Sarah Brown says \"I want to reclaim the often misplaced voice.\"\n\nThe film features writer, poet and model Elijah Che; performer, Trans+ activist and the mother of London Trans Pride Lucia Blayke; artist and lead singer of the band Forest Flowers Noel Oganyan; and drag royalty Chiyo Gomes, The Prinx of Provocation.\n\nCreator and director Sarah Brown says \"During the current political climate this film touches briefly on the many identities that are facing oppression, violence and harm. These identities and bodies need to be visible as a constant awareness that we, trans and gender non-conforming people, exists. It is important we hear these stories from the outside looking out as opposed to the inside looking in.\"", "description": "New Creative artists using spoken word to explore questions of identity", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07pjf7f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
