And to make it even more Breaking Bad-esque, he\u2019s wanted for *checks notes* METHAMPHETAMINE POSSESSION, according to KWQC. You just can\u2019t make this shit up.\n\nComplete with a bald head, glasses and White\u2019s infamous facial hair, Facebook users instantly loved the connection to Bryan Cranston\u2019s meth-cooking character.\n\nDisregarding the fact that the man is a wanted criminal, fans of the show flooded the comments section with gifs, show references and conspiracy theories.\n\nMany users suggested that the whole situation was a stunt by Netflix to promote the upcoming spinoff movie El Camino, which is released next month.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I doubt the Galesburg PD are going to be Netflix\u2019s first call when it comes to a bit of guerrilla marketing tactics.\n\nBut if it\u2019s anything like that time not-David Schwimmer was caught stealing a bunch of beer, I don\u2019t think Barrick Jr is going to stay hidden for very long.\n\nJust last month, the Ross Geller doppelganger was jailed for fraud and stealing offences after Schwimmer got in on the joke, likely increasing the public\u2019s awareness of the wanted criminal.\n\nAs far as we know, Barrick is still on the run from police.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to commit a crime, maybe make sure you don\u2019t look eerily similar to a popular celebrity.", "description": "Walter White's doppelganger, Todd Barrick Jr. is wanted by Galesburg Police for probation violation for his methamphetamine charges.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/pjimage-26.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
