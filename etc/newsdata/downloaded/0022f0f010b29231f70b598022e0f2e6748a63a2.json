The fighting was so brutal it was compared to the Second World War battle of Stalingrad.\n\nYet now, with Turkish warplanes dominating the skies, they face a fresh siege and more bloodshed.\n\nA wounded child injured in an alleged Turkish airstrike receives medical treatment at a hospital in Tal Tamr, northeastern Syria on October 13, 2019\n\nTurkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has designated Kobane as inside a 20-mile \u2018safe zone\u2019 for his war against Kurdish militia.\n\nThe military offensive began six days ago following Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from the border area.\n\nThe Kurds have had to strike a \u2018deal with the devil\u2019 \u2013 asking their former foe, Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, to protect them.\n\nThe family home I visited last year is now abandoned and my hosts have fled, along with thousands of Kobane residents. The city has come under heavy Turkish shelling.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who were the US-led coalition\u2019s \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 during the fight against IS and who lost 11,000 fighters, say President Trump\u2019s move was a betrayal.\n\nTurkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has designated Kobane as inside a 20-mile \u2018safe zone\u2019 for his war against Kurdish militia\n\nIn a shocking video shared online, a mother cradling her dying daughter after fleeing Kobane, cries: \u2018America sold us out to Turkey. They are murdering us and our children. Where are the rights of the Kurdish people? Aren\u2019t we human because we are Kurds speaking Kurdish?\n\n\u2018I have nowhere to go and nowhere to live. Where will I go if they steal my homeland Kobane?\n\n\u2018Why was Erdogan not doing anything while Islamic State was attacking Kobane and beheading our children?\u2019\n\nMustafa Al-Ali, who was born in the city, expressed his fury at Washington and London for failing to intervene, despite still having special forces in the area.\n\n\u2018Turkey was shelling randomly and everybody was screaming and crying,\u2019 he added. \u2018People started heading to the US base. They wanted to be protected, everyone is trying to find a safe area.\n\n\u2018Kobane was the first city that defeated Islamic State. We lost so many people and now Turkey is shelling it and nobody is doing anything. The Kurdish people have been fighting IS to protect the UK and the US and we have been betrayed.\n\nSmoke billows above the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad on October 13, 2019, as Turkish-backed forces push their offensive against Kurdish forces to take territory along the border\n\n\u2018Everyone is trying to find a safe area. If Turkey carries on there will be an ethnic genocide of the people of Kobane.\u2019\n\nThe assault forced the Kurds to make the pact with Assad on Sunday. Details of the agreement are unclear but it appeared to temporarily calm nerves despite Assad\u2019s regime having brutally suppressed the Kurds in the past.\n\nResidents in Kobane, which is described as the heart and soul of the Kurdish people, said they had been faced with a simple choice between the dictator or genocide at Turkey\u2019s hands.\n\nKobane resident Said Mostafa Habbu said: \u2018The whole world stands against us, this is murder that is being committed against us. The whole world sees what is happening and the [Western] coalition has a hand in it.\n\n\u2018They have been here for a long time, then they agreed among themselves and left us. The solution for us is the regime. We are part of Syria.\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian fighters sit atop an armoured personnel carrier in the southwestern neighbourhoods of the border Syrian town of Tal Abyad\n\n\u2018I see no better than that now. Otherwise we would have faced a genocide like the Armenians.\u2019\n\nAnother resident, Farid Jumaa, said: \u2018If the regime came in now it would be very good. What can we do? We have to.\u2019\n\nBut not everyone was happy with the defensive pact. A former petroleum worker from the countryside near Kobane, who did not want to be named, said the Assad regime could not be trusted.\n\nHe added: \u2018For the Syrian Democratic Forces this is a deal with the devil. Assad would kill his people just to stay president.\u2019 The latest fighting in Syria began last Wednesday when Mr Erdogan launched Operation Peace Spring. He considers the US-backed SDF to be a terrorist group that supports separatists in Turkey.\n\nYesterday he said he believed his forces would easily take Kobane despite the arrival in the area of Russian-backed Syrian troops. \u2018It looks like Turkey\u2019s operation won\u2019t have any problems,\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Erdogan promised he would keep up the fight against the Kurdish militia until \u2018ultimate victory\u2019 was secured. Turkey has the second largest army in Nato.\n\nMourners attend the funeral of five Syrian Democratic Forces' fighters killed in battles against Turkey-led forces in the flashpoint town of Ras al-Ain along the border, on October 14, 2019\n\nThe European Union issued its strongest statement yet yesterday, saying it condemned Turkey\u2019s \u2018military attack\u2019 on Syria. It called on \u2018all member states to stop selling any kinds of arms\u2019 to Ankara.\n\nMeanwhile the escape of hundreds of jihadi brides from a camp in Syria has raised fears of terrorists returning to the UK.\n\nTooba Gondal, an alleged IS recruiter, is among those thought to be on the run from the detention facility near Ain Assa.\n\nThe site in north-east Syria was attacked by IS sleeper cells. Zara Iqbal, who has pleaded to return to Britain after travelling to the war zone with her sister Reema and their children from east London, was known to have been in the camp.\n\nThree orphans, also thought to be from London, were rescued from the Ain Issa camp yesterday. A Save the Children spokesman said that Amira, ten, Heba, eight, and Hamza, six, had been taken to a centre for lone children. Their parents died fighting for IS.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wehbe Romi in Kobane.", "description": "Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has designated Kobane as inside a 20-mile 'safe zone' for his war against Kurdish militia.", "authors": ["Larisa Brown On The Turkey-Syria Border For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19711412-0-image-a-76_1571088142331.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
