It's massive.\"\n\nMr Banducci said the company had only received the final underpayment estimates on Wednesday morning and disclosed them as soon as possible.\n\nHe said the company expected to make \"a contrition payment\", which are paid by businesses who enter undertakings with the regulator to avoid prosecution and usually amount to 2 per cent of the total underpayment.\n\n'Time bomb ticking'\n\nWoolworths started reviewing salaried staff in February with the assistance of PwC when a handful of managers questioned why they were paid less than union staff under the new enterprise agreement.\n\nThe company historically ensured salaries covered ordinary hours and reasonable overtime on an average roster but did not account for award penalties or allowances triggered from long hours or late nights.\n\nThe problem of underpaying salaried staff was also behind million dollar underpayments at George Calombaris' Made Establishment and defence giant Thales and the shoppies union said it was now \"call[ing] on all retailers to audit their payroll settings especially for salary staff.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeloitte partner and former FWO, Natalie James, said companies were \"brazenly overconfident\" about their compliance in the area, with many HR offices unaware the award still applied to those under annualised salaries.\n\n\"There is either a naivety or neglect in the way business has been approaching these annualised arrangements and it has resulted in long-standing underpayments,\" she said.\n\n\"If business isn't dusting off these arrangements right now they need to know they have a blatant time bomb ticking away in their payroll.\"\n\nFrom March next year, new rules will require companies to conduct regular pay reconciliations for salaried employees under 19 industry awards, including administrative workers, graduate lawyers and restaurant staff.\n\nFWO puts boards on notice\n\nMs Parker warned she was increasingly frustrated by the upsurge in underpayments from large businesses and \"intended to take this issue up with boards around the country\".\n\n\"Frankly that is the level within organisations that should be taking an active leadership role on this issue, and seeking assurance about compliance from executive managers.\"\n\nWoolworths has promised to repay workers with interest and will provide an update in February and a final account in its full year results.", "description": "Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci said he expects to lose his bonus and flagged further consequences over what is the biggest underpayment on record.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_58/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a505587def8138010ebf5c7f8c8e005059703488", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
