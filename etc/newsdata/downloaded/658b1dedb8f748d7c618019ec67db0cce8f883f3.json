Cowboys WR explains 'truth in every joke'", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE USA TODAY Sports Jori Epstein talks to Jason Witten after back-to-back losses for the Dallas Cowboys. USA TODAY\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014 Amari Cooper has heard the trope long enough to play along.\n\nSure, the Cowboys receiver will tell you, he has a book on route-running and releases. The chapters are numbered one to 100. Chapters vary between breaking down the importance of speed and plethora of double moves. Chapter 53, for example, details a second-level release. For releases one through 10, Cooper will lead with his right foot, quarterback Dak Prescott says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be watching tape and he\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, dang, you see that, Dak? That was release 13. That was release AC-50.\u2019 Or release 53. \u2026 He has some reasoning behind the numbers.\u201d\n\nThe story is elaborate and consistent enough across the Cowboys locker room to sound believable. Besides, Cooper says when questioned by cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, why shouldn\u2019t he remember his route numbers? After all, he wrote this book. Awuzie sighs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s truth in every joke,\u201d the defensive back says wisely.\n\nAmari Cooper (19) celebrates his fourth quarter touchdown against the Packers. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCooper separates fact from fiction.\n\n\u201cThe reason I came up with [the idea of my book] is because I noticed everywhere I\u2019ve been in high school, college, NFL, guys who play with me would tell me, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 or \u2018How\u2019d you do that? How\u2019d you create that separation on that route?\u2019\u201d Cooper said Thursday from his locker at the Star. \u201cI\u2019d just notice them like trying to emulate the same moves and I was like, \u2018You went into my book for that.\u2019\u201d\n\nA Cowboys WR has posted 200 receiving yards just 12 times in franchise history.\n\n\n\nIn less than a year, Amari Cooper has done so twice. pic.twitter.com/dQpB9kMKHV \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 11, 2019\n\nCooper\u2019s book has become an increasing must-read since the Cowboys dealt their 2019 first-round draft selection to Oakland last October. In less than a year, he has applied it to become the first Cowboys receiver to post multiple 200\u00ad-yard receiving games. In 14 regular-season games and two playoff contests, Cooper has amassed a monstrous 1,408 yards and 12 touchdowns on 98 receptions.\n\nHe capitalized on man coverage from Dolphins Pro Bowl cornerback Xavien Howard in Week 3 to post 88 yards and two scores. Against Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander last Sunday, he racked up 226 yards and another touchdown. Cooper wasn\u2019t satisfied with his production in the 34-24 loss, instead pointing to an interception that brushed his hands in the first quarter.\n\nBut he understands that people marvel at his separation. Often, he has the answers.\n\n\u201cBoy, that Amari put on a clinic out there on route-running,\u201d Jerry Jones tells @1053thefan of Cowboys WR. \u201cThose routes were unbelievable.\u201dpic.twitter.com/fo04nE0DfI \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cMost corners are similar in terms of how you can beat them,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThere\u2019s only a select few that you have to actually go to the back of the book on.\u201d\n\nCooper has faced defenses that have successfully limited him. In Week 4, Saints Pro Bowl cornerback Marshon Lattimore helped contain Cooper to five catches for 48 yards in Dallas\u2019 12-10 loss. Against the Colts last December, Cooper was held to four balls for 32 yards in a 23-0 shutout loss. But more often, against talented defenders who closely shadow his moves across a whole game, Cooper simply goes to the \u201cglossary,\u201d he says half-jokingly.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t met a corner I had to write a new chapter on,\u201d Cooper adds.\n\nWith a talented Cowboys offense, he may not need to much this year.\n\nWEEK 6 PICKS: Do Dolphins or Redskins break into win column?\n\n100 WORST TEAMS EVER: Could Dolphins, Redskins join most hopeless in history?\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\nNo one in Dallas doubts Cooper has elevated an offense that leads the league with 452.8 yards per game and ranks fourth with 312 yards by air. But the single coverage Cooper has seen lately is largely thanks to the weapons that line up beside him. League rushing titleholder Ezekiel Elliott is a constant threat that can compel defenses to load the box to defend the run. Eleven-time Pro Bowl tight end Jason Witten returned from retirement to catch a touchdown in each of the Cowboys\u2019 first two games. Longtime Packers slot man Randall Cobb has proven a smart and mostly dependable underneath threat. And second-year receiver Michael Gallup, taking huge strides in the offseason, currently leads the league averaging 113 receiving yards per game this season.\n\nNFL leaders in receiving yards/game:\n\n\n\n1. Cowboys WR Michael Gallup 1\u20e31\u20e33\u20e3\n\n2. Saints WR Michael Thomas 1\u20e30\u20e38\u20e3.6\u20e3\n\n3. Cowboys WR Amari Cooper 1\u20e30\u20e32\u20e3.4\u20e3 \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cYou key on one guy? The other guy\u2019s going to hurt you,\u201d Prescott says of throwing to two of the league\u2019s top-three leaders in receiving yards per game. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t even got it going with Cobb and Witt and those other guys inside of that. It helps. It\u2019s dangerous.\n\n\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s fun to have.\u201d\n\nKellen Moore on defenders playing man vs. Cowboys WR Amari Cooper: \"Amari likes it. I like it. I think everyone likes it from a passing game perspective.\"\n\n\n\n(\ud83d\udcf9: @dallascowboys)pic.twitter.com/NuKP8Fzj7s \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 10, 2019\n\nThe Cowboys view defenders\u2019 choice against No. 19 as a catch-22: Does a coordinator let Cooper burn his defensive back? Or will a secondary double-cover Cooper at the risk of Witten, Cobb and Gallup making them pay? All of this, of course, while facing Dallas\u2019 usually-strong offensive line and Elliott. When defenders pick their poison and single-cover Cooper, Prescott is ready to strike.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s man to man, are you kidding me?\u201d Prescott says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t learned yet? We\u2019re going to attack him.\u201d\n\nPrescott, Cooper and teammates agree that their productive days don\u2019t mean much when they lose. They traversed 563 offensive yards with a late comeback attempt against Green Bay but \u201cit\u2019s not a good feeling,\u201d Prescott emphasized, returning to the locker room having thrown three interceptions. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s really on my mind,\u201d added 226-yard Cooper, \u201cis the dropped ball and the turnover it created.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that approach, and that unwritten rule in Cooper\u2019s book, that Prescott insists will make the difference as fans keep reading.\n\n\u201cI read where y\u2019all asked him about [his stats] and he said, \u2018Sure, great but it didn\u2019t exceed my expectations,\u2019\u201d Prescott said. \u201cI mean, that says it all to me right there. The numbers are great, right? But his expectations for himself, for this offense, for us is the reason we\u2019re going to grow, reason we\u2019re going to keep getting better, we\u2019re never going to be complacent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hungry guy. He\u2019s quiet at times. But when it comes to being a competitor, there\u2019s not many like him.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
