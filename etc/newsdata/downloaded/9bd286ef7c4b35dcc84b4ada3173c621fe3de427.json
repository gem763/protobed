It is also the position of the central government (in Beijing) that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own.\n\n\u201cBut if the situation becomes so bad, then no options can be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Mask ban backlash \u2013\n\nLam has faced widespread criticism over her decision to ban face masks \u2014 ubiquitous in Hong Kong since a deadly SARS outbreak in 2003 \u2014 and thousands of Hong Kongers flouted the prohibition during an unsanctioned mass march on Sunday.\n\nSo far two people \u2014 a male university student and a 38-year-old woman \u2014 have been charged with illegally wearing masks, and supporters wore their own face coverings during a court appearance on Monday.\n\nThe two were charged with unlawful assembly, which carries up to three years\u2019 jail time, and with defying the mask ban, which has a maximum one-year sentence. Both were released on bail.\n\nLam told journalists it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to say whether the anti-mask law was effective or not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree that for any new policy or new legislation, it will take time to be effectively implemented,\u201d she said.\n\nLam also would not be drawn on a suggestion by one of her cabinet members, the veteran pro-Beijing politician Ip Kwok-him, that Hong Kong may curb access to the internet in a bid to contain the protests.\n\nThe leader insisted she was \u201cvery committed\u201d to using political, legal and policy instruments, including dialogue, to address some of the \u201cdeep-seated problems\u201d in the city.\n\nThirteen of the city\u2019s subway stations remained closed on Tuesday following the widespread vandalism and the operator said the entire network would close at 8pm (1200 GMT).\n\nAccording to Hospital Authority figures, ten of the 13 people admitted to hospital over the weekend were in a stable condition on Tuesday while three had been discharged.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s under-fire leader Carrie Lam said Tuesday she would not rule out accepting help from mainland China in tackling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/d48ea3_carrie-lam-told-reporters-she-believed-hong-kong-can-tackle-crisis-on-its-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
