Roosevelt\u2019s limousine drove onto to the field ahead of the 1933 World Series, the last time the nation\u2019s capital hosted the Fall Classic. Congressional hearings on the stock market collapse were postponed so senators could attend the game.\n\nHarry S. Truman tossed out a first pitch from the stands of a regular season game in August 1945, just days after the end of World War II, giving Americans a sense that normalcy was returning after years of global conflict.\n\nGeorge W. Bush wore a bulletproof vest under his jacket when he threw a perfect strike from the Yankee Stadium mound during the 2001 World Series, not 10 miles from where the World Trade Center was attacked a month earlier.\n\nTrump, who has yet to throw out a ceremonial first pitch since taking office, plans to arrive after the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros are underway and leave before the final out, in hopes of making his visit less disruptive to fans, according to Rob Manfred, baseball\u2019s commissioner.\n\nWhile it will be Trump\u2019s first time attending a major league game as president, he has deep ties to the sport.\n\nA longtime New York Yankees fan who was spotted regularly at games in the Bronx, he was also a high school player with enough talent that, he has said, he drew the attention of big-league scouts.\n\nPresidential attendance at baseball games has \u201cbecome an institution and a unifying influence in a nation that is losing both,\u201d said Curt Smith, a former Bush speechwriter and author of \u201cThe Presidents and the Pastime.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is part of the job description, irrespective of whether the president is a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal or a conservative. Bush found it a joy, he understood the symbolism of the moment. And he was the rule, not the exception,\u201d Smith said.\n\nTrump mentioned his World Series plan to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. But when asked whether he might throw out the first pitch, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re going to have to dress me up in a lot of heavy armor,\u201d apparently referring to a bulletproof vest. \u201cI\u2019ll look too heavy. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nBut the Nationals, who decide on ceremonial first pitches, made clear that the president was not asked to take the mound. That honor instead will go to a notable Trump critic, celebrity chef Jose Andres, whose humanitarian work has been widely acclaimed.\n\nAndres, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Spain, has been a longtime critic of the president\u2019s views on immigrants and he halted plans to open a restaurant at the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. The Trump Organization then sued Andres, who also denounced the administration for failing to do enough to help the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017.\n\nThere\u2019s some suspense around how Trump might be greeted at the game.\n\nThough the fans at the high-priced event are likely to skew more corporate than at a regular season Nationals contest, Trump is extremely unpopular in the city he now calls home. In the 2016 election, Trump won just 4 percent of the vote from the District of Columbia.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House staff has long tried to shield him from events where he might be loudly booed or heckled, and he rarely ventures out into the heavily Democratic city. (With the exception of his hotel, a Republican-friendly oasis a few blocks from the White House.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be loud for Trump but every president gets booed: both Bushes, Reagan, Nixon. When Americans pay for their ticket, most of them buy into the great American tradition to boo whomever they want,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHe should embrace it: So what if the elites boo you? Think of how it plays with your voters elsewhere in the country, thinking \u2018There they go again, booing our guy.\u2019 Use it!\u201d\n\nTrump has long been a baseball fan, especially of his hometown Yankees. Before he became president, he would be spotted at games, sometimes along the first-base line with then-Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly. Trump was also memorably photographed behind home plate across town in the moments after the final outs of the 2006 NLCS when the New York Mets lost to the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nTrump played high school baseball at New York Military Academy, where he was a star first baseman. His coach, Col. Ted Dobias, told Rolling Stone in 2015 that Trump \u201cthought he was Mr. America and the world revolved around him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was good-hit and good-field,\u201d Dobias said. \u201cWe had scouts from the Phillies to watch him, but he wanted to go to college and make real money.\u201d\n\nPhillies spokesman Greg Casterioto said Friday that the team\u2019s scouting records do not go back that far and there is no way to verify that claim. But Trump, when honoring the 2018 World Series champion Boston Red Sox at the White House in May, fondly remembered his time playing the sport.\n\n\u201cI played at a slightly different level,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut every spring I loved it. The smell in the air.\u201d\n\nThat event also underscored Trump\u2019s tumultuous relationship with professional sports. Several Red Sox stars, including Mookie Betts, and the team\u2019s manager, Alex Cora, declined to attend the White House ceremony. Trump has disinvited other championship teams, including the Golden State Warriors and Philadelphia Eagles, from attending after some of their players criticized him.\n\nTrump is, so far, the only president since William Howard Taft in 1910 not to have thrown a first pitch at a major league game. (The first president known to attend a game was Benjamin Harrison in 1892). Calvin Coolidge, nearly a decade before Roosevelt, was the only other president to attend a World Series game in Washington.\n\nTrump will sit with league officials and likely watch from a luxury box, behind security and away from much of the crowd. That would be very different from some of his predecessors, including John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, who sat by the field for their ceremonial duties.\n\n\u201cIn the old days, they would throw from the presidential box,\u201d said baseball historian Fred Frommer, who has written several baseball books, including a pair of histories about Washington baseball. \u201cPlayers from both teams would line up on the first base line and would fight for it, like a mosh bit. And whoever emerged with it would take it to the president for a signature.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Donald Trump's plan to attend Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday will continue a rich tradition of intertwining the American presidency with America's pastime.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jonathan Lemire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/26/presidents_and_baseball_26254_c0-83-1985-1240_s1200x700.jpg?077d99e07ef57bbdd87b5163b1aabcd5d5b97e7a", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
