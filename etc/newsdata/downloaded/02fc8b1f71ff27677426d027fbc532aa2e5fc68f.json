August was the second hottest August since records began.\n\nCopernicus said its data was further evidence of our planet\u2019s \u201clong-term warming trend\u201d.\n\nThe service, which uses satellite imaging to observe ground-based climate trends, said it had registered significantly hotter than average months for the central and eastern United States, the Mongolian plateau and parts of the Arctic.\n\nTemperatures in Europe were lower than the September average, as they were in southwestern parts of Russia and parts of Antarctica.\n\nYet the overall trend is hotter, according to Copernicus Director Jean-Noel Thepaut.\n\n\u201cThe recent series of record-breaking temperatures is an alarming reminder of the long-term warming trend that can be observed on a global level,\u201d Thepaut said.\n\n\u201cWith continued greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting impact on global temperatures, records will continue to be broken in the future.\u201d\n\nEarth has warmed a little over 1 C since pre-industrial times and manmade emissions \u2014 as well as atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases \u2014 are rising annually.\n\nSeveral peer-reviewed studies released this year showed that Earth had never in human history warmed so rapidly and uniformly as currently.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Last month was the equal hottest September in history, the European Union\u2019s satellite monitoring service said Friday, the fourth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/d95dc7_copernicus-climate-service-september-2019-was-57-celsius-hotter-historical-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
