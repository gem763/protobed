Section 12 of the Geneva Convention Act prescribes the detention by the SA National Defence Force with respect for their rights, of prisoners of war,\u201d Okah said.\n\n\u201cThe Correctional Services Act No 111 of 1998 does not recognise the rights of a prisoner of war and my imprisonment under inhuman conditions in South African prisons severely and adversely affected my defence and ensuing appeals processes,\u201d he added.\n\nOkah said that he had intended to call former presidents Jacob Zuma and Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria as \u201chostile witnesses\u201d, but was told by the court that the duo could not be compelled to appear in a South African court under existing laws.\n\nOkah explained that he intended to subpoena Zuma because he was made aware that he allegedly interfered with the judicial process by intimidating magistrates into signing search and arrest warrants without prima facie evidence of wrongdoing on his part.\n\n\u201cThe interference of Zuma, I learnt, had been brought about partly due to pressure from the MTN group as was reported by Nigerian media had faced threats of the nationalisation of the assets by the government of Nigeria, and on the other hand bribes paid to Zuma and his associates; which bribes were said to include cash and oil wells in Nigeria,\u201d reads Okah\u2019s affidavit.\n\nRegarding Jonathan, Okah said that after the October 1 2010 bombings, the former president had told Nigerians that he was aware of the identity of the perpetrators and had exonerated him.\n\n\u201cArticle 27(2) of the ICC Act expressly allows for presidents and other government officials to be compelled to appear before a hearing under the ICC statute. It is my submission that had I secured the appearance in court of these two witnesses, the outcome of my trial would most certainly have been different, and this was only possible had I been tried under the ICC Act,\u201d he added.\n\nA date for the case has not been set.\n\nTALK TO US Did South Africa violate international law when it tried and convicted Nigerian terrorist leader Henry Okah?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword OKAH and tell us what you think.
