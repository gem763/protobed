That\u2019s after Huawei was blacklisted by the Trump administration in May 2019.\n\nSpeaking to The Financial Times, Joy Tan \u2013 vice president of public affairs at Huawei US \u2013 said the situation was \u201cchallenging\u201d and that building an alternative to Google services on Android could take years.\n\nHuawei\u2019s recently launched Mate 30 smartphone does not come loaded with any Google apps, nor does it have access to Google\u2019s app store.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nA senior Huawei executive has admitted that Harmony, the company\u2019s proposed replacement for the Android operating system on its phones, could take years to build.\n\nJoy Tan, vice president of public affairs at Huawei US, made the admission in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nAsked if Harmony could take years to develop, Tan said: \u201cYes. We have to find alternative solutions for that ecosystem, but it\u2019s going to take some time to build. There are so many Android users in Europe and south-east Asia, and they\u2019re so used to these Google applications on top of Android phones.\u201d\n\nTan\u2019s remarks contradict comments made by Richard Yu, Huawei\u2019s consumer boss. Yu said earlier this year that Harmony could be ready to ship in early 2020 \u2013 effectively in a few months\u2019 time.\n\nThe Chinese phone maker has been hit by US sanctions in recent months, with the Trump administration making no secret of its antipathy towards the Chinese telecoms giant. It believes Huawei equipment could be used for spying, and therefore poses a national security risk to the US. The Trump administration blacklisted Huawei in May, meaning that any firm wanting to do business with the company has to obtain a government licence.\n\nThe blacklist had one immediate dramatic effect: Google would no longer be able to license its apps and services to Huawei.\n\nAccordingly, Huawei\u2019s recently launched Mate 30 phone comes without any Google apps at all, in a major blow to the company\u2019s hopes of gaining ground in the Western smartphone market. Access to Google services is one of the key reasons people buy Android phones.\n\nRead more: Huawei\u2019s new Mate 30 flagship phone doesn\u2019t come with any Google apps, and it\u2019s the first big tech casualty of the US-China trade war\n\nAs well as being unable to load its Mate 30 phones with flagship Google services including the Google search app, Gmail and Google Maps, Huawei was also unable to provide Mate 30 users with access to the Google Play Store, which is the primary way Android users download apps on their phones.\n\nThe Mate 30 instead runs on the open-sourced version of Android. Older Huawei phones are still able to access Google services.\n\nSenior analysts have echoed Tan\u2019s admission, too. Thomas Husson, vice president and principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, said: \u201cIt will take time for Huawei to offer an alternative \u2013 not just to develop a smartphone-friendly version of Harmony OS but to foster a competitive ecosystem of brand and developer partners.\n\nDescribing the delayed development of Harmony as a \u201cdirect consequence of the US-Chinese trade war,\u201d Husson added that any delays in Harmony being rolled out could deter retailers from selling the Mate 30.\n\n\u201cIf consumers can\u2019t easily access their favorite apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Google Maps and many more, retailers in some European countries may even be skeptical [about] the opportunity to distribute the devices,\u201d he said.", "description": "Business Insider - Harmony is viewed by Huawei as a future replacement for Android.
