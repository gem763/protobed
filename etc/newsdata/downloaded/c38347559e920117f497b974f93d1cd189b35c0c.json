Aramco will first list shares on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Tadawul exchange, with a second-stage international listing planned for the future. (Wall Street Journal)\n\nTalking point: Valuation has been a major sticking point for the state-owned energy giant; the IPOwas formally halted in 2018 due to investor skepticism about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s original US$2-trillion figure. Since then, oil prices have improved and the company revealed its closely guarded financial details to the public. But executives working on the IPO have maintained that US$1.5 trillion is a more realistic valuation. The final number is a balancing act\u2014it has to be high enough to fulfill the crown prince\u2019s ambitious economic diversification goals, but low enough to satisfy skeptical investors. Listing in two stages\u2014first domestically, and then internationally\u2014is one way to drive up that number, helping ensure demand exceeds supply.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/L-TheLogic_logo_black@3x-150x150.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
