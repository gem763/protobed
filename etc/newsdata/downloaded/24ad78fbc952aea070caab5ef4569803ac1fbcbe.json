It\u2019s just enough to slightly distort the screen, and I can feel it under my finger. There\u2019s something pressing up against the screen at the hinge, right there in the crease. My best guess is that it\u2019s a piece of debris, something harder than lint for sure. It\u2019s possible that it\u2019s something else, though, like the hinge itself on a defective unit pressing up on the screen.\n\nIt\u2019s a distressing thing to discover just two days after receiving my review unit. More distressing is that the bulge eventually pressed sharply enough into the screen to break it. You can see the telltale lines of a broken OLED converging on the spot where the bulge is.\n\nWhatever happened, it certainly wasn\u2019t because I have treated this phone badly. I\u2019ve done normal phone stuff, like opening and closing the hinge and putting it in my pocket. We did stick a tiny piece of molding clay on the back of the phone yesterday to prop it up for a video shoot, which is something we do in every phone video shoot. So perhaps a tiny piece of that snuck into a gap on the back of the hinge and then around or through its cogs until it lodged in between the screen and the hinge. It\u2019d be sort of like Charlie Chaplin getting caught in the gears in Modern Times.\n\nOr maybe something got in another one of the little gaps somewhere else. Or maybe it was pieces from the hinge itself breaking loose and working their way up into the screen. I don\u2019t know. I just know that the screen is broken, and there was no obvious proximate cause for the bulge that broke it. I certainly haven\u2019t used it on a beach or shook it in a bag of chips or anything wild. Just normal use.\n\nI don\u2019t know what happened; I just know the screen is broken\n\nWe\u2019ve seen worries about scratches on expensive phones and debris breaking the keyboard on expensive MacBooks, but a piece of debris distorting the screen on a $1,980 phone after one day of use feels like it\u2019s on an entirely different level.\n\nI reached out to Samsung right away to get a statement, but it took about 24 hours for the company to put one together. Here it is, and the gist is that Samsung is looking into our unit and also warning users not to try to peel off the protective layer on the top of the screen.\n\nAlso, I have, however, received a replacement review unit from Samsung. I think the first one is on a jet to South Korea for Samsung\u2019s engineers to take apart and diagnose.\n\nBy the way, it appears I\u2019m not the only reviewing the phone who has had a problem with the screen.

Samsung says you are not supposed to remove it. I removed it, not knowing you\u2019re not supposed to (consumers won\u2019t know either). It appeared removable in the left corner, so I took it off. I believe this contributed to the problem. pic.twitter.com/fU646D2zpY \u2014 Mark Gurman (@markgurman) April 17, 2019\n\nAnd here\u2019s Marques \u201cMKBHD\u201d Brownlee confirming he, too, had to get a replacement unit after peeling off the outer layer (which, again, wasn\u2019t our issue):\n\nPSA: There's a layer that appears to be a screen protector on the Galaxy Fold's display. It's NOT a screen protector. Do NOT remove it.\n\n\n\nI got this far peeling it off before the display spazzed and blacked out. Started over with a replacement. pic.twitter.com/ZhEG2Bqulr \u2014 Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) April 17, 2019\n\nIt looks like retail units of the Galaxy Fold will include a warning about not removing the protective layer, but review units don\u2019t seem to have included this one:\n\nDear future #GalaxyFold owners, I know I always say \"No one ever read the instructions\"... PLEASE READ THIS ONE!!!\n\n\n\n(This is the wrap over the screen of the Galaxy Fold) pic.twitter.com/LuQPRfDZIE \u2014 Des (@askdes) April 17, 2019\n\nLike everybody else, I said in my original hands-on with the Galaxy Fold that I absolutely am able to see the crease between the two sides of the screen. But when I\u2019m using the phone, I don\u2019t actually notice it much. It\u2019s easy to talk about it as a small first-generation compromise you have to make for what is otherwise a wonder of engineering: a tablet that folds in half.\n\nAnother thing people are worried about is the plastic screen scratching or picking up nicks easily. There are already a couple of minor dings on my unit, but they\u2019re minor enough that I didn\u2019t see them until our photographer zoomed way in to show them to me. If you look closely at the edges of the screen, there\u2019s a sort of built-in screen protector on the front of the device. Samsung calls it a \u201cpolymer layer.\u201d It is not designed to be removed. (Please don\u2019t try it if you get your hands on a Fold.)\n\nBut while the crease and the nicks feel like compromises you could live with, a mysterious bulge that breaks the screen is something else entirely \u2014 especially one that appears just a day after pretty normal use. It\u2019s a problem that is unacceptable on a phone that costs this much.\n\nEvery phone with movable parts is going to have more points of failure than a fully sealed, static phone. So it\u2019s natural to say that you need to treat it with more care than usual. Before I saw this bulge, my impression was that this phone was much more durable than I expected. The hinge always felt solid and well-built. That impression of (relative) durability is obviously as broken as the flexing screen now.\n\nIf I\u2019m right and it\u2019s debris, it means that not only do you need to treat your phone with care, but you also have to worry about stuff getting in underneath the screen. If I\u2019m wrong and it\u2019s some kind of defect in the hardware, well... then we\u2019re in entirely different territory. Either way: yikes.\n\nHopefully Samsung lets us know the results after it takes my original review unit apart to see what happened.\n\nGrid View Photo by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Ver\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nUpdate, 5:40 PM ET: Added another tweet showing Samsung\u2019s warning against removing the protective outer layer, which \u2014 again \u2014 wasn\u2019t the issue with our review unit.\n\nUpdate 10:30 PM ET: added link to Samsung statement.", "description": "Although it\u2019s only been in our hands for a couple of days, something broke on Samsung\u2019s top-flight, $1,980 folding phone.
