Roessler Jr. announced Wednesday that he had canceled the suspension and restored to duty an officer who had turned an illegal immigrant over to ICE.\n\nChief Roessler said an investigation is still ongoing but he ended the officer\u2019s suspension after a \u201cprocedural policy recommendation\u201d as of Friday.\n\n\u201cWe have one of the best police forces in the U.S. and I have confidence that our officer will represent us well throughout his career,\u201d the chief said in a statement.\n\nA day before he had announced the suspension and publicly shamed the officer, accusing him of breaking department policy by checking for warrants on a person he encountered at a traffic stop who lacked a license, then detaining the man when the county\u2019s system showed he was wanted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nChief Roessler said the officer \u201cdeprived a person of their freedom, which is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nHe also said his department\u2019s reputation had been harmed, and the punishment was a way to restore credibility with the community.\n\nImmigrant-rights activists had cheered the chief, saying he was showing solidarity with their communities by taking the bold step of suspending an officer for violating a sanctuary policy.\n\nBut offers of assistance and support for the officer poured in as well, and Chief Roessler was harshly criticized for attempting to make an example out of the officer.\n\nChief Roessler said Fairfax County policy is not check to for administrative warrants of people it encounters but is not arresting. ICE generally uses administrative warrants, rather than judicial warrants, for its enforcement of the law against illegal immigrants.\n\nThe officer did check for administrative warrants and when one came back in the county system the officer called an ICE deportation officer who arrived to pick up the illegal immigrant, who was a fugitive after having failed to show for a deportation court case.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
