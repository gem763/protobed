You can crank it up from cool to super cold. But if you\u2019re not using your car\u2019s \u201cair recirculation\u201d button, you\u2019re not getting the coolest driving experience possible.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen the button \u2014 it looks like a vehicle with a swooping arrow in the center \u2014 and we\u2019ve probably hit it from time to time. But there are very specific times when the button is helpful, and certain times when it\u2019s not.\n\nUse it when you get in a hot car\n\nWhen you first get into a sweltering car and start to crank the AC, hit the air recirculation button, too. This will recirculate the now slightly cooler air from the car and cool it down even further, rather than pulling in more hot air from outside. The process cools your car down quicker than using the regular fresh air mode.\n\nOnce the air reaches a reasonably cool temperature, though, you can turn off the recirculation button to avoid the air becoming too stale within the vehicle. If you encounter a particularly dusty area or get behind a bus spewing out exhaust, you might avoid some of the smell permeating your car by temporarily switching the air recirculation back on until you\u2019re past it.\n\nDon\u2019t use it in the winter\n\nRecirculation traps moisture inside the vehicle; in the winter, which means foggy windows. So a good rule of thumb is to not use the air recirculation button at all if you\u2019re using your vehicle\u2019s heater.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have this button in your vehicle, don\u2019t worry. Chances are you\u2019re in a newer model car, which is equipped with sensors that monitor the moisture levels inside the vehicle. It\u2019s doing all the work for you, switching between fresh and recirculated air, as needed.", "description": "You can target the air conditioning toward your body, your feet or both.
