He was also unable to wrest money from Congress. So the president declared a national emergency early this year in order to use Pentagon funds \u2014 even though he admitted in a speech at the time: \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this ... but I\u2019d rather do it faster.\u201d\n\nWhat's that old saying? If at first you don't succeed? Try, try again... (to get Mexico to pay for it? and then Congress? and then just raid legitimate military budgets?) \u2014 Dan Rather (@DanRather) September 5, 2019\n\nThe $3.6 billion money-grab will be pulled from international and domestic construction and maintenance projects for the Defense Department \u2014 and from education for the children of service members. Projects affected will include facilities used to store hazardous waste, repair Navy ships and conduct cyber-operations in 23 states, three U.S. territories and 19 countries. Puerto Rico, which is continually bashed by Trump, will lose about $400 million in funds, CNN reported.\n\nThe Pentagon is already pleading with Congress to replace the money that\u2019s being shifted to the border, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe funding switch was attacked by Democrats \u2014 and Republicans. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) complained that \u201cCongress has been ceding far too much powers to the executive branch for decades, and it is far past time for Congress to restore the proper balance of power.\u201d\n\nEven Republicans who backed Trump\u2019s emergency move have found that their states will sacrifice millions in funding. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is losing a $63 million middle school at Fort Campbell.\n\nDiverting funds \u201cmeant to support U.S. national security interests so that he can build a border wall only makes us less safe,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said in a statement. \u201cTaking money away from our military ... will mean we are less equipped to tackle threats here at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nCutting the funding used to reinforce our trusted European allies against Russian aggression in order to advance @realDonaldTrump\u2019s own politically-motivated vanity project\u2014that he promised Mexico would pay for\u2014is outrageous, wrong, and weakens our national security. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) September 5, 2019\n\nCritics on Twitter had a few things to say about Rather\u2019s dig.\n\nTrump thinks the American tax payers money is his Daddy\u2019s Trust Fund, to spend willy nilly on his whims. \u2014 \ud83c\udf0e\ud835\udc16\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e\ud83c\udf0d (@American4Love) September 5, 2019\n\nThe art of the deal... \u2014 Matt Jensen (@bestestname) September 5, 2019\n\nDan, right now he's retroactively trying to get Alabama affected by the hurricane so Trump's a little busy right now buddy \u2014 SueinPhilly (@sueinphilly) September 5, 2019\n\nYet he's supposed to be so pro-military! \u2014 E-Man (@patch1000) September 5, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s only pro-trump. \u2014 Glinda (@geegeeking49) September 5, 2019\n\nSupport the troops?: Kiss my Ranger Ass!!!! \u2014 Doogal (@Doogal3) September 5, 2019", "description": "\"Try, try again,\" the veteran journalist scoffs on Twitter.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d71c1c7240000fb1776f050.jpeg?cache=a0uvs1v2z1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
