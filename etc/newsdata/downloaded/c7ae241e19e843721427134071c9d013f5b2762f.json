A new campaign seeks to overturn the convention", "language": "en", "text": "YES by Jenni Murray\n\nThere\u2019s now something of a campaign to end what\u2019s known as the \u201812-week rule\u2019 \u2014 where a woman is expected to stay quiet about her pregnancy during the first trimester \u2018in case something goes wrong\u2019.\n\nJenni Murray says she wants the 12-week rule to stay as she once had an ectopic pregnancy\n\nThis week Katy Lindemann, author of a new book on baby loss, argued that the 12-week rule makes the pain of miscarriage worse as many women are left to suffer in silence. Her piece sparked responses from many women online reporting similar experiences. Campaigners say keeping silent about pregnancy heaps pressure on women and cuts them off from support if anything goes wrong.\n\nI have much sympathy for anyone in that situation. But I must say I have no regrets about my decision to keep my first pregnancy a secret, sharing it only with my partner, David. I was 31 and trying to advance my broadcasting career. David was a naval officer and often away from home. Nevertheless, we were more than ready to start a family.\n\nThe pregnancy was confirmed using a home test, and I had just made an appointment with the GP when disaster struck. David was away for a short trip at sea. I was having dinner with friends when I doubled up in pain. I got home and, in the middle of the night, called a friend, a consultant in the NHS, who said: \u2018I won\u2019t diagnose you over the phone, but get to hospital, quick.\u2019\n\nHe made the right judgment. My six or seven-week pregnancy was ectopic, with the foetus stuck in the fallopian tube. I had an operation, which meant removing the foetus and the tube \u2014 and was reassured by the surgeon that I would \u2018fire perfectly well on one cylinder\u2019 \u2014 with my one remaining fallopian tube.\n\nI went back to work after a few days, greatly relieved I hadn\u2019t had to endure any overreaction from my mother, who\u2019d known nothing about the possibility of becoming a grandmother, or any excess of sympathy and advice from colleagues and friends, who all thought it had been merely a grumbling appendix.\n\nFEMAIL is considering whether the 12-week rule, when women get their first scans, should stay or should be removed (stock image)\n\nSix months later, I was very lucky to find I did \u2018fire on one cylinder\u2019 and my son, Ed, was the result. Four years later came Charlie. In both cases, I kept to the \u201812-week rule\u2019 and felt glad that, if anything did go wrong, I wouldn\u2019t have to open up to every acquaintance who asked.\n\nI felt no shame or guilt at my earlier failure, but still wonder, at times, if the one I lost was the daughter I\u2019d always longed for.\n\nNO by Jennie Agg\n\nCongratulations! my friend whispered, bear-hugging me. I smiled and said thank you, but then immediately added: \u2018But it\u2019s still early so, you know . . .\u2019\n\nJennie Agg wants the rule to go as, after four miscarriages, it has started to feel like a cruel joke\n\nI was six weeks pregnant, and convention dictates a pregnancy is not to be spoken of until the end of the first trimester, the 12-week mark when most women have their first NHS scan. It may be an unofficial rule, but there is a whiff of superstition around it, as if you\u2019re tempting fate if you don\u2019t keep mum.\n\nBack then, our first pregnancy, we didn\u2019t question the rule. Like most people, we kept it as quiet as we could because \u2018what if something happens?\u2019\n\nSomething did happen. I miscarried in hospital three days before our 12-week scan. It was bloody and frightening and utterly devastating.\n\nWorse, almost no one knew. For weeks, most people had no idea why I was grey and subdued; monosyllabic with sadness. And I had no idea how to tell them. The internet is full of \u2018cute\u2019 pregnancy announcement ideas. It is less helpful on how to break miscarriage news.\n\nAfter a miscarriage (I\u2019ve had four now, all in the first trimester), the 12-week rule starts to feel like a cruel joke \u2014 you didn\u2019t tell people out of some vague notion this might happen, and now it has you realise you have unwittingly cut yourself off from sympathy or understanding. It keeps you quiet; it feels a lot like shame.\n\nAfter losing a baby, the 12-week rule feels like a cruel joke\n\nWhy do we accept this? It might have made sense when reliable home pregnancy tests didn\u2019t exist and a woman had to wait until she\u2019d missed several periods to be \u2018sure\u2019.\n\nBut, in the 21st century, it feels illogical, even dismissive, a coded message that a pregnancy isn\u2019t \u2018real\u2019 before 12 weeks.\n\nIn an age of digital tests and private scans as early as six weeks, a pregnancy \u2014 and your relationship with the child you believe is coming \u2014 starts a long time before 12 weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s no good grumbling that a miscarriage is \u2018just a heavy period\u2019 and that \u2018women find out too early these days\u2019 and expecting us to pack our grief neatly away.\n\nAlso, if we didn\u2019t have this \u2018rule\u2019, it would quickly become painfully, plainly obvious how common miscarriage is. Then it might be taken more seriously. We might make more progress with research into its causes and possible treatments. Rather than brushing it under the carpet, we\u2019d know how to comfort the people it affects: men as well as women.\n\nMost miscarriages happen before 12 weeks. But why does that mean they should happen in silence?", "description": "Jenni Murray said she wants the rule should sty as she losta child due to an ectopic pregnancy but Jennie Agg wants it to go as when she miscarried, she wanted to talk to people about it.", "authors": ["Jenni Murray", "Jennie Agg For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19513980-0-image-a-56_1570658519716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
