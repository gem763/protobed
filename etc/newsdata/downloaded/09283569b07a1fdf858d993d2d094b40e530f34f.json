And most sane people would see similarly.\n\nNot People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\n\nPETA\u2019s been involved with a campaign for some time to compel the Department of Transportation to put a halt to the airplane industry\u2019s transport of research animals, particularly monkeys, from overseas locations to U.S. research labs. And the fight\u2019s just taken on heftier significance; the feds have issued new guidelines for airlines regarding service and comfort animals \u2014 guidance that clarifies, for instance, \u201cthe most commonly recognized service animals (dogs, cats and miniature horses) are accepted for transport\u201d under the service animal category.\n\nThink about that: 250 pound horses are OK to fly the friendly skies. But monkeys for medical research?\n\nThat\u2019s where it gets a bit murkier.\n\nThat\u2019s where PETA has inserted itself, demanding a stop to imports of research animals via airlines.\n\nIn one recent web post, the group wrote, \u201cDepartment of Transportation: Don\u2019t Let Animal Experimenters Force Airlines to Transport Monkeys to Their Deaths.\u201d\n\nWith rather eyeball-rolling rhetoric, the post went on to state that \u201cexperimenters are so bloodthirsty for animals to imprison, harm and kill that they have filed a formal complaint with the Department of Transportation to try to compel these private airlines to do the[ir] bidding.\u201d\n\nReally, PETA \u2014 really? As if medical researchers are lurking in their labs, wringing hands deviously, chuckling maniacally, gleefully anticipating the next shipment of monkeys to murder.\n\nAs if \u2014 nod to hypocrisy here \u2014 PETA doesn\u2019t do the same type of pressuring of public airlines.\n\nIn recent years, British Airways, China Southern Airlines, Qatar Airways and United Airlines have all stopped transporting monkeys from outside countries to the United States for medical research purposes, in large part because of pressures from PETA.\n\nHmm. \u201cCompel\u201d much, PETA? Press \u201cprivate airlines\u201d to do your \u201cbidding\u201d much, PETA?\n\nAnyhow, in another recent post, PETA wrote, \u201cAnimals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way.\u201d\n\nWell actually \u2014 they are.\n\nParticularly when human lives are at stake.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not as if U.S. medical researchers who use animals are unregulated.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture sets the standards for the \u201chumane handling, care, treatment and transportation of animals\u201d used for research purposes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulates \u201cimportation, exportation and interstate trade\u201d of both dead and live animals, as well as their tissues. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regulates and inspects animal transports at the borders.\n\nThe Endangered Species Act serves as a tool of enforcement and punishment for matters related to animals, including research; so, too, the Lacey Act, which \u201cprohibits inhumane and unhealthful transportation\u201d of animals.\n\nIt\u2019s enough oversight to make PETA\u2019s characterization of animal researchers as bloodthirsty beasts a bit laughable.\n\nBut that\u2019s the problem with PETA.\n\nThe group has some fine people doing some fine animal-saving work.\n\nBut setting animals as equal to people, as worthy of the same societal and political prioritization and protections as humans, is not just un-biblical, completely counter to God\u2019s designs of humans having dominion over His other creations. It\u2019s also a bit batty.\n\nIt\u2019s indicative of a weak moral compass and a fuzzy mental state.\n\nAnd, in this case, in this case of pressuring airlines and feds to halt the importation of animals for medical research, it\u2019s outright hazardous to humans\u2019 health.\n\nAnimals are great. But people are better. And if experimenting on monkeys saves even one human life \u2014 so be it. That\u2019s a trade any sane person ought to be willing to make.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
