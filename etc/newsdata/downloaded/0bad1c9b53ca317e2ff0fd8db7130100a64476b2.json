But there\u2019s no reason, she insists, why baseball and history shouldn\u2019t be combined, as they are in this book.\n\nAs she puts it, \u201cHistory and baseball \u2014 two of my earliest and enduring passions \u2014 are the building blocks of this heartfelt memoir by Bud Selig.\u201d She first met him 20 years ago in Milwaukee, she tells us, where she delivered a lecture on a Selig hero, Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n\u201cEvery time we have seen each other since, there has been a happy contest between my desire to talk baseball and his to talk history. So how delighted I am to write the foreword for this memoir that serves both as a work of history and a riveting account of baseball during a fraught and transformative time.\u201d\n\nContributing to the fraught times during his tenure as commissioner was the growth of uncontrolled drug use. It was 2007, the year, as Mr. Selig puts it, \u201cwhen sluggers found extra power through chemistry, and, of course, Barry [Bonds] was one of the leading men in baseball\u2019s steroids narrative.\u201d\n\nOthers like Sammy Sosa and Mark McGuire also suddenly developed Charles Atlas bodies and began to hammer the ball, but it was Mr. Bonds and the race to break the home run record set by Henry Aaron, a longtime friend of Mr. Selig who closed out his career in Milwaukee, that personally distressed him.\n\n\u201cThere is plenty of blame to spread around in this sad chapter, and I\u2019ll accept my share of the responsibility. We didn\u2019t get the genie back in the bottle in time to protect Aaron\u2019s legacy.\u201d They did, however, finally develop a successful system of drug testing.\n\nMuch of Mr. Selig\u2019s memoir is a nuts-and-bolts description of what the work of a baseball executive is like. But there are also family moments with Sue, his highly intelligent wife; his daughter who for a time managed the Milwaukee Brewers; his mother who took him regularly to baseball games; his father with a successful Milwaukee Ford dealership where, after graduating from the University of Wisconsin, he briefly went to work.\n\nBut then the Milwaukee Braves, refugees from Boston, decided to move again, this time to Atlanta, and a civic group, vowing to keep baseball in Milwaukee, purchased the bankrupt Seattle Pilots. How the Pilots became the Brewers and Bud Selig became their owner is a book in itself.\n\nThere are also moments of high emotion here, as when President George W. Bush, in the wake of 9/11, appeared at Yankee Stadium to throw out the first pitch, with the crowd chanting \u201cUSA!\u201d \u201cUSA!\u201d \u201cUSA!\u201d\n\nWhether you had voted for President Bush or not, writes Mr. Selig, \u201cthat vision of the President of the United States right there, in front of the whole world, while the heinous villain on the other side hid in the mountains somewhere \u2014 if that didn\u2019t make you proud to be an American, I don\u2019t know what will.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, back to George Will, who maintains that the four most important people in baseball history are \u201cAlexander Joy Cartwright (the genius who in the 1840s placed the bases 90 feet apart), Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson and a fan from Milwaukee. Which is what Selig has been, first and always.\u201d\n\n\u2022 John R. Coyne Jr., a former White House speechwriter, is co-author of \u201cStrictly Right: William F. Buckley Jr. and the American Conservative Movement\u201d (Wiley).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nFOR THE GOOD OF THE GAME: THE INSIDE STORY OF THE SURPRISING AND DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL\n\nBy Bud Selig, with Phil Rogers\n\nForeword by Doris Kearns Goodwin\n\nWilliam Morrow, $28.99, 318 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
