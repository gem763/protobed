Be sure to check out our top 12 albums from the month as well.\n\nStream The List On Spotify\n\nThe 1975, \"People\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nSerious turn-of-the-millenium, white studded belt energy as Matty Healy's screaming street preacher exhorts, \"Stop f****** with the kids!\" \u2014 Lars Gotrich\n\nAndrew Combs, \"Born Without a Clue\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nWritten immediately after Tom Petty died, the Dallas native channels (and perhaps surpasses) his hero, with irresistible hooks and refined vocals urging us to be true to ourselves. \u2014 Tom Huizenga\n\nBaby Rose, \"All to Myself\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nIf this honest, majestic and controlled sonic heartache tells you anything about Baby Rose, it's that she' just getting warmed up. \u2014 Sidney Madden\n\nBig Thief, \"Not\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThis is the rawest I've ever heard Big Thief. Gathered tight together in a room, no overdubs \u2014 this is one fierce song! \u2014 Bob Boilen\n\nLillie Mae, \"Love Dilly Love\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nWhat even is country music? The Nashville singer's incredible album closer upends all conventions with a surreal twist on the you-done-me-wrong ballad. \u2014 Robin Hilton\n\nMariah the Scientist, \"Beetlejuice\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nWhen drama and betrayal are baked into a relationship from the start, spontaneous combustion is inevitable. Mariah the Scientist knows this reaction all too well. \u2014 Sidney Madden\n\nMidland, \"Every Song's a Drinkin' Song\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\n\"Every Song's a Drinkin' Song\" would have been a country classic in any year country music has existed. A sway-along barstool anthem, it infuses its simple truths with weary wit. \u2014 Stephen Thompson\n\nStream The List On Apple Music\n\nMissy Elliott, \"Throw It Back\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nWe missed Missy. Yes, that's the royal we for her majesty. Somehow, she returns with another pop-drop-and-lock-it bop that picks up where she left off and still leaves her heirs playing catch up. \u2014 Rodney Carmichael\n\nNormani, \"Motivation\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nYou gotta see the video \u2014 a dance tour de force \u2014 but this breakout hit by the former Fifth Harmony member is itself a late-summer dominator, its bubbling bass line stepping up to an HBCU band-worthy horn as her vocal expertly blends pep and seduction. \u2014 Ann Powers\n\n(Sandy) Alex G, \"Near\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\n\"All I want is to be near you,\" Alex Giannascoli repeats feverishly over chaotic percussion, a warped reminder of the experimental pop songwriter's knack for turning even the sweetest sentiments strange. \u2014 Marissa Lorusso\n\nSheryl Crow, \"Cross Creek Road (feat. Lukas Nelson)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nOf the many (many) guests on Threads, Neil Young's rambling guitar solo and Lukas Nelson's verse light up a dusky sky like never before heard on a Sheryl Crow record. Did we mention Margo Price and Don Henley sing backup? \u2014 Lars Gotrich\n\nSiR, \"Hair Down (feat. Kendrick Lamar)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nIf only life moved at this speed. SiR and Kendrick Lamar team up for the soundtrack to traffic lights and stop signs. \u2014 Otis Hart\n\nSnoh Aalegra, \"Find Someone Like You\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nBetween Snoh Aalegra's velvety vocals and that dewy, warm piano, this glimmering album standout could slot right into the end credits of a 2019 Brown Sugar sequel. \u2014 Sidney Madden\n\nTaylor Swift, \"Soon You'll Get Better (feat. Dixie Chicks)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nTaylor Swift's country ballad about facing her mother's cancer struggle is so effective because, as she sings, she makes it \"all about me,\" communicating fear and loss in details as bravely honest as the songcraft is impeccable. \u2014 Ann Powers\n\nTerri Lyne Carrington and Social Science, \"Bells (Ring Loudly) [feat. Malcom-Jamal Warner]\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThis anthem's poignant spoken word, snaking chords and haunting melodic lines rebuke the police brutality every black mother fears. Here's one line: \"Blue lives splatter red on canvasses of brown skin as if black lives mattering is a game to them and not a basic right within all men are created equal.\" \u2014 Suraya Mohamed\n\nTinariwen, \"Kel Tinawen (feat. Cass McCombs)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nEven among its Toureg peers, no one really makes music like Tinariwen. But here the band leans into a slick blues groove as Cass McCombs whispers through the rolling hypnosis. \u2014 Lars Gotrich", "description": "Missy Elliott reminded us just how vital and future-seeking she continues to be, Normani offered a late-summer dominator and Big Thief got raw.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/08/29/missyelliott_wide-6799a5f4c5fc39887814832396d3647dbf84d911.jpg?s=1400"}
