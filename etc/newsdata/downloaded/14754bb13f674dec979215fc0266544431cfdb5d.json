When Sabina was born her mother was not allowed to cuddle her for two weeks.\n\nSabina said: \u201cIn the 80s, it was believed that premature babies would have a better chance of survival if they were left alone.\n\n\u201cWhen I was first born, my parents were only allowed to see me once a day and other relatives were only allowed once a week.\u201d\n\nA major risk for premature babies is breathing problems as their lungs are one of the last things to develop.\n\nSabina required intubation, which is the process of inserting a tube through the mouth and then into the airway. The tube is connected to a ventilator to assist breathing.\n\nAt just two weeks old Sabina\u2019s mother Lynda Morris suddenly noticed her tiny baby daughter had turned blue.\n\nLynda, 72, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. I wasn\u2019t sure how to sound the alarm so I just began screaming.\n\n\u201cThe nurses rushed over and found that her tube had been dislodged and she wasn\u2019t breathing properly. She was fitted with a new tube and quickly regained her colour, but it was a really scary experience.\u201d\n\nSabina remained in Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for more than three months and went home in February 1987.\n\nShe is now a specialist on the neonatal intensive care unit at Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital - having first deciding she wanted to become a doctor aged just six.\n\nSabina said: \u201cMy school did some fundraising for our local neonatal unit, and because the school knew I was born there prematurely, I went along to visit.\n\n\u201cAfter walking on the ward and seeing all of the newborn babies in their cots, I came home and told my mum I wanted to be a doctor.\u201d\n\nSabina, who now lives in Forest Hill in south east London, added: \u201cI knew I needed that human element that being a doctor would give me.\n\n\u201cThough it was a long and often difficult road, I felt like I wanted to give something back to the NHS that had saved my life.\u201d\n\nEvelina London is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. Its neonatal unit cares for more than 1,000 babies a year and has some of the best survival rates in the UK.\n\nDr Grenville Fox, clinical director of Evelina London neonatology, said: \u201cAdvances over the last 30 years mean that the outcomes for babies born at 28 weeks is typically far better than when Sabina was born.\n\n\u201cHowever her story shows that being born prematurely doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will hold you back.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Sabina Checkett has a special bond with the tiny babies she cares for at Evelina London Children's Hospital", "authors": ["Martin Bagot"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724523.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196821641.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
