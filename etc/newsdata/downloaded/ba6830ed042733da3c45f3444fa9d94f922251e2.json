Fundstrat co-founder Thomas Lee remains mighty bullish on the stock market.\n\nHe believes that the S&P 500 will print new highs despite faltering economic data published earlier in the week.\n\nThomas Lee: ISM Bottom Is a \u2018Risk On\u2019 Indicator for Stocks\n\nCNBC reported that the ISM Manufacturing Index dropped to 47.8 in September, marking the worst month for American factories in a decade. The weak manufacturing output \u2013 coupled with less-than-encouraging data in the service sector \u2013 is a signal of sluggish economic activity and could present the stock market with a bearish forecast.\n\nHowever, the Fundstrat executive believes that the worst is behind the manufacturing sector.\n\nPredicting that US PMI has found a bottom, Lee said that the S&P 500 could surge to a new all-time high of 3,125 before the end of the year. That implies upside of nearly 7% from the index\u2019s present level near 2,930.\n\nThis is a daring prediction considering that US PMI hasn\u2019t ranged this low since the financial crisis.\n\nThe weakness in the manufacturing sector is possibly one of the reasons why J.P. Morgan predicts a recession in the next 12 months.\n\nJ.P. Morgan: \u2018US Recession Risk Has Risen\u2019\n\nWhile Tom Lee forecasts growth in the following months, J.P. Morgan begs to differ.\n\nIn a chart posted by the widely-followed Holger Zschaepitz, the financial institution projects that the US economy has a 40% chance of plunging into a recession within a year based on economic markers. If you look at the yield curve signals, the odds climb to 60%.\n\nHedge fund founder Will Meade supports the view of J.P. Morgan. In a tweet, the former Goldman Sachs analyst told his followers that yesterday\u2019s rally was a chance to get out of the stock market.\n\nWe also spoke to Emma Muhleman, a global macro strategist who doesn\u2019t share Tom Lee\u2019s rosy outlook. She told CCN:\n\n\u201cEquity markets are likely to be volatile and we anticipate some turbulence and rising volatility as the quarter progresses toward year end.\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\n\u201cGlobal economic activity should continue to weaken after we just saw the US ISM manufacturing gauge hit levels not seen since June 2009.\u201d\n\nHowever, for now, it appears that Wall Street\u2019s bull case has been more persuasive to investors.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stock-market-economy-trader-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
