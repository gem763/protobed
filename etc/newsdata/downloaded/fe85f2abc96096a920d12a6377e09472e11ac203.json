Both sides said deputy-level officials would work together in mid-September to lay the groundwork.\n\nLate Wednesday, White House officials cheered the news of the talks, adding that they see a willingness by the Chinese to have direct discussions as a positive sign. But they also said it isn\u2019t clear whether the talks will produce a breakthrough and added that they are waiting to see what the Chinese bring to the table. Plans to meet in person come as both sides ramp up punitive tariffs on each other; the U.S. plans to raise them even more. U.S. tariffs of 15% on $300 billion worth of mostly consumer items from China are coming into effect. China is retaliating, hitting items like American soybeans with higher tariffs. And it is letting the yuan depreciate to help mitigate the impact of the levies. U.S. tariffs of 25% on $250 billion of Chinese imports, largely on items used by businesses, are set to rise to 30% on Oct. 1, likely before the next round of trade talks can conclude. Chinese state TV said the two sides plan to work together and \u201ccreate favorable conditions\u201d for the negotiations. \u2014William Mauldin and Andrew Restuccia contributed to this article.
