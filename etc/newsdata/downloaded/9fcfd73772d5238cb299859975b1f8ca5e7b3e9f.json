Rival taxi app Lyft, which floated in March, is about 40 per cent down.\n\nBeyond tech stocks, SmileDirectClub, which sells alternatives to orthodontic braces, managed to raise $1.35bn from investors before its shares plummeted 28 per cent in their first day\u2019s trading last week.\n\nWeWork has been criticised in some quarters as an extreme example of hype over substance, having already racked up losses in excess of $3bn while spending freely on expansion.\n\nWeWork leases offices on long-term contracts before renting them out on short-term contracts to companies and freelancers.\n\nThat leaves it potentially vulnerable in a downturn when its customers seek to cut costs by ending their tenancy. Despite the simple business model, WeWork markets itself as a technology company that is changing the way people work and has attempted to value itself accordingly.\n\nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, summed up a widely held view: \u201cIt would appear that WeWork has missed the boat when it comes to getting investors to buy into an idea that has yet to prove profitable.\n\n\u201dWith the company losing $2 for every $1 it makes, even a valuation as low as $15bn and $18bn hasn\u2019t been enough to whet investor appetite, particularly since a number of this year\u2019s unicorns are now languishing below their IPO launch prices.\n\n\u201cAs Uber can attest, a popular business model doesn\u2019t always translate into a realistic valuation and looking at WeWork\u2019s numbers it is hard to make a case for the type of valuation being asked for now, let alone the one we saw at the beginning of the year.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRead more As WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?", "description": "Flexible office provider WeWork has been forced to shelve its much-hyped stock market listing after receiving a cool reception from investors.Once said to be chasing a $47bn valuation, WeWork has struggled to drum up interest at $15bn to $20bn, which many analysts believe is still too high for a company", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2mX7btd1PItRZqYjCrrvgw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/214d9392707a49bcba4403a705d582fb", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
