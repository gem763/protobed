REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union are not yet close to a Brexit deal that could safely resolve the Irish border riddle and London needs to come up with serious proposals, but the mood music has improved, Ireland said on Friday.\n\nHopes of a resolution to the tortuous three-year Brexit crisis were raised in recent days and sterling shot up to a 2-month high on Thursday when European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a deal was possible.\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney repeated that a deal was possible but cautioned that the gap was still wide and underscored the risks of a disorderly Brexit - civil unrest on the island of Ireland and a dislocation of trade.\n\n\u201cI think the mood music has improved,\u201d Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told BBC radio. \u201cWe all want a deal, we all know that a no-deal will be a lose, lose, lose for everybody, but particularly for Ireland and Britain.\n\n\u201cBut I think we need to be honest with people and say that we\u2019re not close to that deal right now. But there is an intent I think by all sides to try and find a landing zone that everybody can live with here.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he wants to strike an amended deal at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18 but that if that is not possible then he will lead the United Kingdom out without a deal.", "description": "Britain and the European Union are not yet close to a Brexit deal that could safely resolve the Irish border riddle and London needs to come up with serious proposals, but the mood music has improved, Ireland said on Friday.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431905295&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0JL", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
