Unlike Singapore or Hong Kong which has a very high concentration of business users, who are very time-sensitive,\u201d Shahril said in the report published yesterday.\n\n\u201cThey just want a direct non-stop flight. That is why Singapore Airlines and Cathay, for instance, have a much bigger business class and they have the ability to fill the business class at higher prices because the underlying users basically are a different market segment.\u201d\n\nKhazanah, through its subsidiary Malaysian Aviation Group Bhd, is the sole owner of MAB.\n\nIn contrast, Shahril said Malaysian consumers are \u201cvery price sensitive\u201d and prioritised this over the product or the convenience it offers.\n\n\u201cThat is why low-cost seat or low-cost carriers have about a 60 per cent share of market in Malaysia. We just don\u2019t have enough business users in Malaysia for full service airline,\u201d he added.\n\nReplying Betong MP Robert Lawson Chuat, Shahril also said that MAB\u2019s share of the domestic flight market was now just over 20 per cent, below low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd.\n\nSubang MP Wong Chen also suggested that MAB carve out niches in the middle, upper-middle, and upper segments \u2015 since its competitors all cater to the low-end segment \u2015 all while keeping the costs low.\n\nShahril replied that it would be a conundrum to operate what he jokingly referred to as \u201chigh-end airline with cheap costs\u201d.\n\n\u201cHigh-end cheap, accurate. What we call austerity class. [Laughs]. No. But there must be a point where the overheads of the staff, engineers and all those things, should be able to meet the number of airplanes you have, right?\n\n\u201cAre we already at that point, that optimum point?\u201d Wong asked, to which Shahril explained that MAB is actually at a very competitive cost point.\n\nIn the same proceeding, Shahril also said Khazanah believed that an oversupply of airlines and flights based in the country is the main reason why MAB is struggling to make money.\n\nBesides Khazanah, other carriers based in Malaysia are AirAsia, its long-haul sister company AirAsia X, and Lion Group\u2019s Malindo Air.\n\nOn Tuesday, Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali said the government will appoint a strategic partner to take over MAB within the next few months.\n\nAzmin told Parliament that four potential bidders have been shortlisted from 20 received by Khazanah and the airlines\u2019 parent company Malaysian Aviation Group Bhd.\n\nThe sovereign wealth fund has been trying to find new owners for MAB after a RM6 billion capital injection since 2014 as well as a massive restructuring that saw the termination of 6,000 employees failed to result in profitability.\n\nPAC said it is satisfied with Khazanah\u2019s explanation over its RM6.3 billion loss last year, which was due to: a change in the government\u2019s telecommunication policy, financial reporting standards, and a change in investment strategy.\n\nRelated Articles Khazanah confirms leaving KLCC for KL Sentral to save RM20m annually Khazanah: Too many airlines based here bad for Malaysia Airlines, weaker ones need to quit Decision on strategic partner for Malaysia Airlines by early 2020 latest, says Azmin", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 24 \u2015 Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB) is uncompetitive in the long-haul and full-service sectors as there are not enough premium travellers in the country, Khazanah Nasional Bhd said....", "authors": ["Zurairi Ar"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
