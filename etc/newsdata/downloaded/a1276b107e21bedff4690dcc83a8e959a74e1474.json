It\u2019s also a slightly lower drop than \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d - both of which had higher initial openings and went on to have long lives in theaters.\n\n\u201cThese are incredible numbers and really reflect how interested and excited people were,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.\n\nThe film had a rollercoaster ride to release, with highs like winning the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and lows when concerns about the film inciting violence made headlines and prompted increased security at many theaters across the country. But audiences have spoken with their dollars and \u201cwere not going to be deterred,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\n\n\u201cIt shows that content wins. A great movie will rise up above all the noise over whatever controversy or security concerns there were,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re totally left out of the water cooler conversation if you haven\u2019t seen \u2018Joker.\u2019\u201d\n\nInternationally, \u201cJoker\u201d added $123.7 million from 79 markets, bringing its global total to $543.9 million after just 12 days in theaters.\n\n\u201cJoker\u2019s\u201d second weekend success played well alongside the counterprogramming of the kid-friendly \u201cAddams Family,\u201d which exceeded expectations and came in a strong second with $30.3 million.\n\nUnited Artists Releasing distributed the film from MGM and BRON Creative that features the voices of Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron and Bette Midler. \u201cThe Addams Family\u201d defied middling reviews (43% on Rotten Tomatoes) and benefited from a marketplace with relatively few family friendly options in theaters right now, aside from \u201cAbominable\u201d which is now in its third weekend.\n\nThe ambitious, star-driven \u201cGemini Man\u201d was not so lucky. The visual effects-heavy Ang Lee film about an assassin on the run from a younger version of himself (both played by Smith using state of the art de-aging technology) opened in third place with only $20.5 million. Even Smith\u2019s disastrous \u201cAfter Earth\u201d had a better debut ($27.5 million).\n\nReviews were overwhelmingly poor (it\u2019s currently at 26% on Rotten Tomatoes) but \u201cGemini Man\u201d also had the \u201cJoker\u201d factor to contend with, which may have contributed to the disappointing opening, according to Dergarabedian.\n\n\u201cGemini Man\u201d was not a cheap endeavor either. The film from Paramount and Skydance cost a reported $140 million to make after rebates and will have a difficult time breaking even.\n\nRounding out the top five were \u201cAbominable,\u201d with $6.2 million, and \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d with $4.9 million.\n\nIn limited release, Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d had an extraordinary weekend, earning $376,264 from only 3 locations. Its $125,421 per theater average is a record for 2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how well (\u201cParasite\u201d) did. It\u2019s one of the biggest stories of the weekend,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThat per theater average means that those movie theaters were full. The demand far outweighed the supply.\u201d\n\nNeon is distributing the class-conscious Korean thriller, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year and is already a massive hit internationally, with over $70.9 million from South Korea alone. With near-unanimous rave reviews, \u201cParasite\u201d is also expected to be an awards contender and will be expanding in North America in the coming weeks.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1.\u201dJoker,\u201d $55 million.\n\n2.\u201dThe Addams Family,\u201d $30.3 million.\n\n3.\u201dGemini Man,\u201d $20.5 million.\n\n4.\u201dAbominable,\u201d $6.2 million.\n\n5.\u201dDownton Abbey,\u201d $4.9 million.\n\n6.\u201dHustlers,\u201d $3.9 million.\n\n7.\u201dJudy,\u201d $3.3 million.\n\n8.\u201dIt: Chapter Two,\u201d $3.2 million.\n\n9.\u201dJexi,\u201d $3.1 million.\n\n10.\u201dAd Astra,\u201d $1.9 million.\n\n__\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/ldbahr\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The first weekend was no fluke: \"Joker\" is a hit.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Lindsey Bahr"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/film_box_office_96622_c0-249-5976-3735_s1200x700.jpg?95b4074c4fcbf8c23fe432cad425fb4a72ec9243", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
