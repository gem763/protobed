Now Cooper and Schave are married. Together they run one of the most infamous tours in Los Angeles. A macabre love letter to the city, Cooper and Schave\u2019s Esotouric tour takes visitors into neglected neighborhoods that were the scenes of grisly crimes in Los Angeles history.\n\nNicholas Coles\u2019s short documentary True Love/True Crime, premiering on The Atlantic today, features interviews with the couple and some entertaining moments from their offbeat tours.\n\n\u201cPeople buy tickets to get a slice of L.A. history, but the real show is Kim and Richard,\u201d Coles told me. \u201cTheir love for Los Angeles and the macabre is infectious and has attracted a cult following. They can literally tell a grisly tale or fascinating story about every street corner.\u201d In the film, Cooper and Schave\u2019s loving yet eccentric rapport is on full display as they navigate the city\u2019s shadowy landmarks, all the while bickering unapologetically.\n\n\u201cLos Angeles crimes are sexier than those in other cities,\u201d Cooper says in the film. \u201cYou want to get close to them, even though they\u2019re dirty and grimy. I think people are really drawn to places of trauma because it reminds you that you are alive.\u201d", "description": "Richard and Kim know a thing or two about Los Angeles murders.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/10/True_Crime_Edit/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
