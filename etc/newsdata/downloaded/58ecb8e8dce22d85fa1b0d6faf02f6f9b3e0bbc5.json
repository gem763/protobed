We've been hosted so well. We want to give back all we can,\" he added.\n\nWorld Cup organisers chose to hold two matches in the remote town of Kamaishi in a bid to aid the region's recovery after it was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed or went missing in Kamaishi following the tsunami. Uruguay beat Fiji in Kamaishi earlier in the tournament.\n\nCanadian coach Kingsley Jones said losing out on playing against Namibia was a blow for his team as it was their best chance to win a match at the World Cup.\n\n\"Right now it is a bit of an empty feeling,\" said the Welshman.\n\n\"I felt today against the opposition that are a good team, that performed well in the World Cup, about the same level as us, we could see where we stand and I believe we would have won today.\n\n\"I think that would have given us a sense of an outcome. This feels like there's no outcome at the moment.\"\n\nCanada have appeared at every Rugby World Cup with their best showing being a quarter-final berth in 1991.", "description": "Rugby-Canadian rugby players help typhoon recovery efforts in Japan", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
