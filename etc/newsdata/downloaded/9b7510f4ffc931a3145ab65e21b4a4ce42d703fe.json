The more jobs you create, the lower the unemployment rate goes, and \u2014 as businesses compete for less talent \u2014 the higher wages must go.\n\nUnfortunately, the Australian economy just keeps on defying it. In August, 34,700 more Australians were employed than in July, according to the latest seasonally adjusted jobs figures. Yet despite strong jobs growth \u2014 the number of new jobs was twice what the consensus expected \u2014 unemployment actually rose 0.1%.\n\n\u201cWhile employment growth has been reasonably healthy over the past year, the demand for labour is being met with increased supply. This is working to keep a lid on wages growth,\u201d BIS Oxford Economics senior economist Sean Langcake said in a note issued to Business Insider Australia.\n\nThose extra jobs are being offset by the fact that Australia\u2019s participation rate \u2014 the percentage of people working or looking for work \u2014 has never been higher. In other words, the number of available workers is so high that the number of new jobs just can\u2019t keep pace.\n\nCBA Australia\u2019s record high participation rate\n\n\u201cNormally the employment growth we have experienced over the past two years would have led to a sizable decline in the unemployment rate. These are not normal times,\u201d jobsite Indeed\u2019s chief Asia Pacific economist Callam Pickering said in a note.\n\nThe record participation rate combined with strong population growth has helped keep the unemployment figure up, as well as underemployment \u2014 where workers can find work but not enough of it.\n\n\u201cIn recent months employment growth has been driven more by part-time roles. There is also a growing divergence between employment growth and growth in hours worked,\u201d Pickering said. \u201cThat suggests that while the economy is still creating jobs it isn\u2019t necessarily creating the same quality of jobs as it was a year or two ago.\u201d\n\nThat all has some major implications for the Australian economy as a whole, regardless of whether or not you\u2019re gainfully employed. The most significant of those is that higher unemployment and underemployment makes wage growth elusive.\n\nCBA Australia\u2019s unemployment rate\n\nThe entity in charge of keeping the economy working for Australians, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), has repeatedly said in no uncertain terms that it wants to slash the unemployment rate to 4.5% so that wages growth will follow.\n\nREAD MORE: The RBA says the era of paltry pay rises in Australia may continue for a long time yet\n\nInstead, it has now had to watch it tick up to 5.3% in August, its highest level in 12 months, all but precluding future wage growth. Without pay rises, Australians can\u2019t be expected to increase their spending, and without their dollars flowing through it, it\u2019s feared the economy will keep on slowing.\n\nREAD MORE: So much of the Australian economy now hangs on getting pay rises\n\nThe consequence is that despite \u201cstrong employment growth\u201d, the RBA may be forced to cut interest rates ahead of schedule, according to the Commonwealth Bank (CBA).\n\n\u201cThe August employment report puts a rate cut firmly on the table at the October RBA board meeting,\u201d CBA senior economist Gareth Aird said in a note. \u201cWe believe that today\u2019s labour force data is the smoking gun that will force the RBA\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\nWith no reason to expect the unemployment rate to improve, Aird said it\u2019s probable that a rate cut will be handed down in October instead of November as previously forecast.\n\n\u201cFinancial markets have moved on today\u2019s employment report. The market was pricing a roughly 50% chance of a 0.25% cut in October this morning. It is now pricing a 70% chance of an October rate cut, which we now also expect will be delivered,\u201d he said.\n\nThe RBA will hand down its decision on 1 October.\n\nREAD MORE: Most Australian economists think interest rates will be kept on hold in September, but reckon the RBA\u2019s time is running out\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
