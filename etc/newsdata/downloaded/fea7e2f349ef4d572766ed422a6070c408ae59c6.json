U.K. Economy Projected to Be 3.5% Smaller Under Johnson's Deal\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would leave the economy 3.5% smaller every year and policy makers at the Bank of England should start thinking about an interest-rate cut, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.\n\nThe chaos surrounding Brexit has already taken a toll on growth, the think tank said in a report published Wednesday. If the U.K. continues on its current path of chronic uncertainty and unchanged trading rules with the European Union -- Niesr\u2019s base-case scenario -- the economy will experience a 2% loss of output.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. economy will continue to suffer what we\u2019re calling a \u2018slow puncture,\u201d\u2019 said Niesr Director Jagjit Chadha. \u201cNo pop, no bang, but a slow puncture, as investment is deferred and delayed in the face of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nNiesr\u2019s forecasts are relative to Britain staying in the EU. Johnson\u2019s deal would leave all parts of the U.K. poorer over the next decade and reduce tax revenue by 2.5%, it said. The report also took aim at the Treasury, saying fiscal policy is in \u201cdisarray\u201d and that the lack of strategy is concerning.\n\nWith Parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid last week canceled plans to hold a budget on Nov. 6, though his fiscal watchdog said Tuesday it will still publish new economic forecasts, based on the assumption that Britain leaves the EU with a transition agreement in place.\n\nThe case for a BOE rate reduction is growing, according to Arno Hantzsche, an economist at Niesr. He cited inflation being below the 2% target, the pound rising, downside risks emanating from the global economy and no-deal risks receding. Still, policy makers are likely to wait until March before making such a move, he said.\n\nThe central bank will announce its latest policy decision and publish new forecasts on growth and inflation on Nov. 7.", "description": "U.K. Economy Projected to Be 3.5% Smaller Under Johnson's Deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1L0ED_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
