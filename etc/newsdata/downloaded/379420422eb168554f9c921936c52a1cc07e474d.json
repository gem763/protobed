I\u2019m coming to Glastonbury, with love.\u201d\n\nThe Sunday teatime slot is usually one of the biggest draws of the weekend. This year Kylie Minogue made her Glastonbury debut 14 years after she cancelled a headline slot in 2005 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nIt was the most-watched Glastonbury performance ever on the BBC, with 3.9 million viewers tuning in. Ed Sheeran previously held the record at 3.1 million viewers for his 2017 headline slot.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kylie Minogue at Glastonbury festivalin June 2019.
