Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nBen: We\u2019re a week away from the third Democratic debates, which will include only the top-ten-polling candidates. But we have fully ten other candidates who didn\u2019t make the cut, yet are soldiering on, sometimes in humiliating fashion. My first and most important question is: When will these people finally drop out?\n\nGabriel: Well, some have suggested it could be coming sooner rather than later. Bill de Blasio, who until yesterday many people thought would stick around till the bitter end no matter what, suggested he\u2019d bow out if he doesn\u2019t make the next round of debates in October. I think you\u2019ll see another wave of dropouts once the October debate qualification deadline hits, in a few weeks. That\u2019s because theoretically more candidates could qualify for that debate than the September one. So everyone is holding out hope they can get onstage still, even if they don\u2019t next week.\n\nOther than that, though, it\u2019s hard to predict: Usually presidential campaigns fizzle out when they run out of money. A few campaigns may be close to that, but we don\u2019t really have a full current picture of all their finances.\n\nBen: Will there be a lot of pressure on these also-rans to bow out, or will the press and voters just ignore them even more as the top contenders continue to debate, raise money, etc.?\n\nGabriel: I think the latter is more likely. Very few of them are in a Hickenlooper-esque situation, where they\u2019d be susceptible to pressure to run for something else. (No, Steve Bullock will not run for Senate! He\u2019s made that pretty clear.) And since they\u2019re not really commanding much attention/money/space in the polls, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s actively hurting anyone for a lot of them to be in the race, for the most part. Who would do the pressuring, anyway? Most voters just don\u2019t care about a lot of the also-ran candidates, so won\u2019t pressure them. The thing is: If you\u2019re getting ignored, you\u2019re gonna run out of money pretty quickly. That\u2019s why there\u2019s such a premium on the debates.\n\nBottom line, as far as the timeline goes: These folks will probably stay in until it becomes abundantly clear to them that they really have no shot at making any of the upcoming debates (we still don\u2019t know what the criteria will be beyond October for qualifying). If it becomes obvious that they really have no shot at the stage, and therefore at getting people to pay attention, we might see some reconsideration and dropouts.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s been embedded in a lot of the talk about these folks, though, is an implied belief that they\u2019re somehow diluting the field, making it hard to gauge the top contenders\u2019 real support. But so many of them are at one percent or less, and if they all got out, it\u2019s not clear that any one of the front-runners would benefit all that much.\n\nBen: Yeah, I think that argument was easier to make when we had John Delaney inexplicably taking up premium screen time during the first debates. With him and the other lower-polling candidates out of the picture \u2014 literally \u2014 it does not seem as much of a pressing concern.\n\nGabriel: Right, and I think the terms of this conversation could change pretty dramatically depending on how the DNC decides to tighten the screws for the November debate \u2014 especially if the October debate stage expands to include Tom Steyer and Tulsi Gabbard, who could conceivably qualify.\n\nBen: What\u2019s the current thinking on the DNC\u2019s thinking?\n\nGabriel: Well, the DNC says it\u2019s not trying to winnow the field. But, obviously, that\u2019s not totally true. I find it pretty unlikely that they would make the November threshold something like 5 percent in polling and 250,000 donors, or something (these are arbitrary numbers; the current needed support levels are 2 percent and 130,000). Because that would essentially cut the field down to 5 or 6 or 7, and that would really look heavy-handed, especially when you look at previous contested primaries and the size of those fields. The party committees have generally been hesitant to elbow also-rans out of the way as long as they\u2019re not too much of a nuisance, and as we\u2019ve just talked about, the nuisance is pretty limited right now.\n\nBen: Do you think any of the ten candidates who aren\u2019t in the debates are hurting themselves by staying in? It\u2019s conventional wisdom that running for president can\u2019t be harmful to one\u2019s image, but I feel Bill de Blasio may be disproving that theory.\n\nGabriel: Well, Kirsten Gillibrand clearly made a calculation along those lines. But think about most of the people we\u2019re talking about. A lot of them really weren\u2019t well known, and will be a bit better known after this. And it\u2019s not like those who have some stature already, like Michael Bennet (a senator!), have so far gone out of the way to do anything that could be embarrassing and diminish that stature. It could happen, of course. Like if Bennet or Bullock show up and try to crash the debates, or something like that. But Tim Ryan will likely return to the House a bit more famous, and that\u2019s fine for him. Bennet will return to the Senate as more of a national figure. Gabbard will have more fans, and she was never trying to play an inside game in the House anyway. Delaney\u2019s not in the House anymore, so what does he care? Bullock isn\u2019t running for Senate, and he isn\u2019t running for governor again. Marianne Williamson? She\u2019s grown her book-buying audience. And so on.\n\nThis goes for de Blasio, too, by the way. He\u2019s not running for mayor again. And I haven\u2019t read any real speculation that he\u2019s going to run statewide anytime soon. (What would that even be? Primarying Schumer?)\n\nThe one thing that these folks might be careful of is how they deal with their opponents: If they\u2019re looking for a Cabinet job or something along those lines, they probably won\u2019t go out of their way to torch any of the front-runners. So, again, I\u2019d expect a lot of these campaigns to fizzle rather than going out with a bang anytime soon.\n\nBen: The line you hear from these campaigns is that in certain past contests, like in 1976 with Jimmy Carter or 2004 with John Kerry, the eventual winner was way, way behind at this point, and then rode a sudden, late surge all the way to victory. With the primary less localized than ever and candidates who were already household names dominating so far, is that an at all plausible path for the likes of anyone who finds themselves in the low single digits or worse?\n\nGabriel: Yeah, that\u2019s a good point. Should\u2019ve mentioned this earlier: Some of these people actually do believe they can pull a Carter! Bullock and Delaney are explicit about it. But a few things make it tough \u2014 this is a massive field, so it\u2019s really hard to see enough other candidates falling apart sufficiently to make this happen. The media attention is so focused on the top few candidates, and so nationalized, that having a \u201cmoment\u201d like that is really hard. And the Dem electorate appears to be so focused on the question of electability that it seems to be unwilling to seriously consider a newcomer/untested person. The only candidate whose positioning tests that proposition is Buttigieg, but he\u2019s still in fifth, far behind the real front-runners.\n\nBen: Lastly, who do you think will be the next candidate to go? If you were a betting man.\n\nGabriel: I mean, does Wayne Messam still count?\n\nBen: I guess technically.\n\nGabriel: K, so, him. If we don\u2019t want to count Messam, or, I guess, Joe Sestak, it\u2019s just so hard to tell. Because the question is really: Is one of Delaney/Ryan/Bullock/Bennet/de Blasio running out of money? Delaney is self-funding. Bullock genuinely seems to be in it for the long haul. BdB seems to have given himself an October 1 deadline. So maybe Ryan or Bennet.\n\nBen: The suspense is (not really) killing me.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss at what point 2020 Democrats who have little chance of winning the primary might drop out.", "authors": ["Gabriel Debenedetti", "Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/01/01-bill-de-blasio.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
