Nothing real is at stake when Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg cook dinner together, or when Donald Trump used to stride away from his ornamented helicopter to the tune of \u201cFor the Love of Money\u201d on his way to assign an inane group challenge to some less famous peers. Television is a welcomed distraction from real life concerns, while politics is, as the great Robert Dahl noted, \u201ca sideshow in the great circus of life.\u201d\n\nIt is no coincidence that it was two former television stars, not two boring politicians, who effortlessly plunged their governments and the global markets into a tailspin in the course of one brief call over the summer. President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump campaign slams Minneapolis mayor, Target Center for 'attempting to extort' them with rally security fees Susan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report MORE, who hosted the hit reality series \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d for more than a dozen seasons, and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who played a schoolteacher turned president on \u201cServant of the People,\u201d rocketed themselves to the top seats of national political power with the formidable communications toolsets of seasoned entertainers.\n\nAs Zelensky himself said according to the published transcript of the call, these toolsets and advantages like name recognition, outsider status, large following of supporters, and natural ability to attract and shape media attention often make celebrity politicians difficult to beat on the campaign trail. Those qualities, however, also come at great cost.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe utter lack of political experience and knowledge that Trump and Zelensky share renders the tedious tasks of responsible government all the more difficult. It also puts both leaders at risk of making grave missteps or breaking the law even without intending to do so. Perhaps most disturbingly, the lax ethical standards and low expectations that the public tends to apply to celebrities, not to mention the strength of party loyalty, diminish the odds that these leaders will be held to account.\n\nPolitical observers trying to make sense of the enthusiastic agreement from Zelensky to take care of the request from Trump to investigate the situation involving Joe Biden Joe BidenA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown MORE have pointed to the youth and inexperience of Zelensky, as well as to the new international norm of appealing to the ego of Trump. Trump is different, as past White House press secretary Sean Spicer once said of the diplomatic style of his former boss.\n\nThe credible ignorance of Trump continues to shield him from the consequences that traditional politicians would face if they engaged in the same activities. Reports that indicate White House aides, rather than the president, took special steps to conceal the transcript, as well as claims that Trump had been in favor of declassifying the transcript since the scandal first broke, bolster the notion that the president was oblivious of any wrongdoing, or even cognizant of any efforts underway to protect him from it. Trump has already invoked the common sense argument that no one would willingly engage in inappropriate behavior in public.\n\nI am not arguing that Trump was unaware of the potential illegality of his alleged actions. His own contemplations suggest he believes otherwise. \u201cWhen you are a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\u201d Trump said in the Access Hollywood tape. \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and would not lose any voters,\u201d he said during the campaign. But whether he knowingly broke the law or not, like most celebrity candidates, his novice status makes pleading ignorance a reliable strategy. That is a political asset with dangerous implications.\n\nI also do not mean to suggest traditional politicians avoid running afoul of the law. One need not look deeper into American history than the Clinton administration and the Nixon administration to discover examples of seasoned politicians behaving wrongfully or illegally. Yet the prospect Alexander Hamilton lamented in the Federalist Papers was indeed that of unqualified and unfit characters practiced in the \u201clittle arts of popularity\u201d rising to power, which he imagined the electoral college could prevent.\n\nThe electoral college has not shown to be the deliberative independent body that Hamilton initially imagined. Weakened political parties and current low trust in government institutions and the mainstream media have exacerbated the extent to which a distracted voting public is left to choose who the most powerful people in the world will be each few years. It should come as no surprise that the people they come to know and love through their television screens often seem like better choices than the politicians they believe are responsible for the worst of our problems.\n\nLauren Wright (@DrLaurenAWright) is an associate scholar and lecturer in politics and public affairs with Princeton University.
