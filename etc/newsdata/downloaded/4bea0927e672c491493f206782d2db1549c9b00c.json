He said the group was waiting for a \"positive response\" from Saudi Arabia. It was not clear what such a response would entail.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi oil facilities, briefly interrupting the production for five percent of the world's oil supplies. The U.S. and the Saudis have blamed Iran, which denies any responsibility and has said that any retaliatory strikes would result in \"all-out war.\"\n\nPENTAGON WEIGHING MOVE TO SEND MORE TROOPS TO MIDDLE EAST TO DETER CONFLICT\n\nYemen has been ravaged by conflict since late 2014 when Houthi rebels, supported by Iran, captured much of the country, including the capital, Sanaa. In 2015, a Saudi-led military coalition launched an air campaign against Houthi rebels. More than 70,000 civilians have died since 2016 and millions more live on the brink of famine, according to the Armed Conflict and Location Event Data Project (ACLED).\n\n'SONIC WEAPON' USED ON DIPLOMATS IN CUBA MAY HAVE BEEN PESTICIDE, STUDY FINDS\n\nAlternatively, Lebanese militant group Hezbollah called Friday for Saudi Arabia to cease its influence in Yemen's civil war. In a televised speech, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to stop inciting war \"because your houses are made of glass.\" Hezbollah and the Houthis are both backed by Iran.\n\n\"Continuing the war against Yemen with no solution is pointless. You are starting to pay the price,\" Nasrallah said. \"One strike knocked out half the oil production, and another strike, you can imagine what it will do.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Saudi-UAE-led coalition has carried out more than 18,000 raids on Houthi-held areas with logistical support from the U.S. The Houthis have significantly stepped up their attacks on Saudi targets in recent months.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Yemen's Houthi rebels said Friday they are halting all drone and ballistic missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, six days after claiming responsibility for a strike that crippled a key oil facility in the kingdom.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/d2ddf9b5-ContentBroker_contentid-473bc3fd9ba84a3d9329cbef62f01479.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
