Biden had just been confronted with an old choice quote of his, in which he said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather\u2026 I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible.\u201d\n\ndid joe biden just talk about a record player pic.twitter.com/TsWvcHVmVA \u2014 Kevin Maisto (@kevinmaisto) September 13, 2019\n\nBiden seemed to be gesturing toward\u2026 improving the home lives of black children? With outdated audio equipment? He started off his answer by referencing the institutional segregation in this country, but then somehow ended up saying that social workers should be brought in to help parents \u201cdeal with how to raise their children.\u201d That\u2019s when he got into the idea that they should \u201cplay the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night. Make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school, or a very poor background, will hear four fewer words spoken by the time they get there.\u201d Yes, that is what he actually said.\n\nI say this completely seriously.\n\n\n\nWhat the bloody hell was this answer from Joe Biden?\n\n\n\nFrom the dismissive smirk, to talking about \"play the radio, make sure you have the record player on at night.\" Then went to talk about Venezuela and Nicolas Maduro?#DemDebate pic.twitter.com/PazYagTVuq \u2014 Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) September 13, 2019\n\nAs Julian Castro, who spoke after this set of, um, ideas, put it, \u201cWell, that\u2019s quite a lot.\u201d And throughout the night, Biden was indeed a lot. He was at some points smug, facing Bernie Sanders to say, while smiling, \u201cThis is America,\u201d when Bernie Sanders described how he had witnessed single-payer health care working in Canada for half of what Americans\u2019 health care costs.\n\nBernie Sanders: \"We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth.\"\n\n\n\nJoe Biden: \"This is America.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries.\" https://t.co/INdRXlIwFs #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/hrYzxLgXiC \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 13, 2019\n\nAt other times, he was flat-out inaccurate: \u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages, we didn\u2019t separate families,\u201d he said of the Obama administration, in response to a question about immigration, despite the fact that they expanded family detention. Later, he was interrupted by protestors, who chanted the numbers of people deported while he served as Vice President: three million.\n\nAnd, like a broken record player, he fumbled through convincing viewers that he even wants to be up there, at one moment accidentally referring to Bernie Sanders as the president. His only saving grace was that no one asked him to read the address of his own website.\n\nJoe Biden just called Bernie Sanders \"the President\". pic.twitter.com/F3q0bvyjsc \u2014 Florian (@BetaODork) September 13, 2019\n\nAnd still, somehow, this man is considered to be the \u201cbest\u201d candidate to beat Donald Trump.", "description": "Joe Biden had a very strange answer to a question about racism involving record players, in a night of unlikeable and confusing moments at the third Democratic presidential debate.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/12/12-joe-biden.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
