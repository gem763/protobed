(AP) - The same day one quarterback passed for 405 yards and four touchdowns, another threw for 380 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThey\u2019ll meet Sunday, but couldn\u2019t be in more different positions. Dak Prescott is on the verge of a contract extension with the Dallas Cowboys that could guarantee him over $30 million, while Case Keenum is a temporary placeholder for the Washington Redskins until first-round pick Dwayne Haskins is ready.\n\nPrescott leads the favored Cowboys into the Redskins\u2019 home opener fresh off a perfect 158.3 QB rating in a Week 1 rout of the New York Giants that took pressure off running back Ezekiel Elliott. Owner Jerry Jones called a new contract for Prescott \u201cimminent,\u201d but the fourth-year signal caller is focusing on Washington and not looking back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so on to the Redskins at this point that I\u2019m off of that game,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit back and hang your hat on something like that or hang your hat on one game. It was a good performance for us to go out and do that in the passing game, obviously win that game the way that we did, but it\u2019s about turning the page.\u201d\n\nPrescott faces a defense that could be without lineman Jonathan Allen, weakening a front seven that should\u2019ve been able to put more pressure on the pocket than the Giants did. Washington struggled at that against Carson Wentz, too, when Allen left with a knee injury, and getting to Prescott is the only way to keep him from throwing wild.\n\n\u201cYou stand back there in the pocket all day and go through your first, second and third reads and come back to your first one, OK, cool. Anybody can do that,\u201d Redskins cornerback Josh Norman said. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s been playing well. As you can see, he\u2019s evolved. He\u2019s growing in the system. He\u2019s just taking his keys and picking his targets and throwing the ball on time.\u201d\n\nKeenum found tight end Vernon Davis for 48 yards and rookie receiver Terry McLaurin for 69 yards on touchdown passes in the 32-27 season opening loss . He was largely done in by a lack of an effective running game, which will look very different this week with Adrian Peterson back from a healthy scratch and Derrius Guice on the shelf after knee surgery .\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we skip a beat with whoever is in there,\u201d Keenum said.\n\nREED TIME\n\nThe Redskins are expected to have Jordan Reed back after their top tight end missed the opener with a concussion. Washington put Reed insurance J.P. Holtz on waivers and lost him to Chicago, and Reed is trending toward being in the lineup Sunday.\n\n\u201cObviously, he\u2019s been a great player for them for a number of years,\u201d Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. \u201cHe\u2019s a mismatch player in the passing game. He\u2019s just really hard to cover and can run a variety of routes. He can beat you in a lot of different ways. So he\u2019s a great challenge.\u201d\n\nZEKE\u2019S LOAD\n\nElliott says he\u2019s ready for a \u201cnormal workload\u201d after getting about half of the touches he\u2019s used to in the opener. The two-time rushing champion missed the entire preseason in a holdout. His first practice was four days before the 35-17 win over the Giants, the same day he signed a $90 million, six-year extension.\n\nElliott, who averaged 25 touches per game his first three seasons, had 13 carries for 53 yards and one catch for 10 against New York. He tried to stay in shape in Mexico during a holdout that ended on its 41st day.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between going out there running around and not being hit and then being hit and having to come back and do the same things,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cSo being hit takes a little more out of you. But I think I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nSTILL NO TRENT\n\nThe Redskins will be without Trent Williams yet again as the starting left tackle\u2019s holdout continues. Peterson, who co-owns a Houston gym with Williams, didn\u2019t get a chance to see his good friend last week but has stayed in touch.\n\n\u201cI wish I would see more of him,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to him, but it wasn\u2019t even about football. Just life, checking in, what he had going and a couple things around the gym, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nEASING BACK IN\n\nThe Cowboys had four defensive starters miss all four preseason games while also getting limited work in practice. Each played less than half of the opener, led by star DeMarcus Lawrence (shoulder surgery) at 46% of the snaps.\n\nFellow defensive end Tyrone Crawford (hip injury), cornerback Byron Jones (hip surgery) and linebacker Sean Lee (knee injury early in training camp) are the others easing their way back, with the Cowboys having to decide how much more playing time they get.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m still all the way back,\u201d said Lawrence, who had half of Dallas\u2019 only sack of Eli Manning. \u201cIt\u2019s so much that comes into this game that you have really go through the drills every day in order to get the feel for it. Feel like I\u2019m getting my legs back underneath me, but it\u2019s still not good enough yet.\u201d\n\nSPREADING IT AROUND\n\nEven with limited carries, Elliott is helping the passing game with his presence. Prescott had five completions of 25 yards or longer involving four receivers against the Giants.\n\nMichael Gallup, who had career highs of seven catches for 158 yards, was the only one of the four without a touchdown. But the second-year player was also the only one with multiple catches of 25-plus yards, including the longest at 62 to set up Elliott\u2019s 10-yard touchdown.\n\nAmari Cooper had a 45-yard catch and a 21-yard TD, while Randall Cobb (25 yards) and tight end Blake Jarwin (28) were wide open on their touchdowns\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s like a defense\u2019s worst nightmare when everybody is making plays,\u201d said Cooper, who had 106 yards on six catches. \u201cHow can you game plan against that? How can you make adjustments? What are you going to do?\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The same day one quarterback passed for 405 yards and four touchdowns, another threw for 380 yards and three touchdowns.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/giants_cowboys_football_14193_c0-217-5184-3239_s1770x1032.jpg?8b8f23121690e0737bdb7f9c933479ff63e997a3", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
