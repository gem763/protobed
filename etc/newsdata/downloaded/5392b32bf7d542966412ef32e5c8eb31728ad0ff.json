He noted that existing contracts with the U.S. military and law enforcement departments were \u201cabsorbing all of Colt\u2019s manufacturing capacity for rifles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that over the last few years, the market for modern sporting rifles has experienced significant excess manufacturing capacity,\u201d Veilleux said in a statement. \u201cGiven this level of manufacturing capacity, we believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nColt\u2019s decision comes amid unprecedented political scrutiny over the sale and potential regulation of the AR-15 and other rifles for civilian use in the wake of several mass shootings.
