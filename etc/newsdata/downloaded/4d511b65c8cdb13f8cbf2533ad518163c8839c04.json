Afghanistan. (Photo: AP)\n\nWith the sunrise comes resistance. As the sun makes its way to the Western Hemisphere, the day has just begun in the US. However, the day is already come and gone in other parts of the world, including Australia, and Friday has seen a successful Global Climate Strike so far. Hundreds of thousands of people in more than 150 countries have already taken part in this historic event.\n\nPacific Island nations such as Kiribati and Tonga were the first to start their days and kick off the global actions, which is fitting given that these islands are ground zero for climate change. Sea level rise from climate change is set to make many of these islands uninhabitable in the next 40 years.\n\nThe Global #ClimateStrike has begun!

The fact that more than 2000 companies in the country allowed staff to take off to participate certainly helped.\n\nFrom there, the energy moved west to Asia, Europe, Africa and now North and South America.\n\nSwedish activist Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old badarse who\u2019s in New York for the United Nations Climate Action Summit, has thrust the strike movement into the international spotlight under the banner of Friday for Futures. She began skipping school in August 2018 every Friday to protest outside the Swedish Parliament. She wanted more action from world leaders on climate change.\n\nHer bold behaviour rapidly spread around the world, and its latest manifestation is what we\u2019re seeing today.\n\nIt\u2019s early morning in the Pacific. Soon the sun will rise on September 20th 2019. Good luck Australia, The Philippines, Japan and all the Pacific islands. You go first! Now lead the way!#fridaysforfuture #climatestrike #schoolstrike4climate\n\n(NZ + many others go next week.) pic.twitter.com/u1pji4SySN \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) September 19, 2019\n\nThe world saw similar climate strikes in March and May, but the pressure is building with more urgency as world leaders gather next week to talk climate change at the UN.\n\nThe kids want to make their message clear: The time to act on the climate crisis is now. In the US, teens are becoming more afraid and more angry about climate change. After all, the situation is growing more urgent. Instead of ignoring these feelings, the teens are putting them to work.\n\nThere Is Always Hope: Why Young Adults Are Coming To The UN Youth Climate Summit Hundreds of young people from around the world have congregated in New York. It\u2019s nearly Climate Week, huge strikes are happening today and Friday, and the United Nations has awarded some 100 young climate activists from different corners of the globe \u201cGreen Tickets\u201d to the first-ever UN Youth Climate Summit this weekend. There, youth will get a chance to engage with global leaders to talk climate change ahead of a major international summit on Tuesday.
