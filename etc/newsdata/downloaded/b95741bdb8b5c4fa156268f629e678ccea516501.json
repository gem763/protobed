Along these lines, we\u2019ve continued to see our card members, partners and global colleague base engage with the issue of plastic pollution in our oceans, which is why we are taking another step to help protect our planet with the announcement of a series of initiatives designed to back our oceans.\u201d\n\nAir pollution passed on. Air pollution particles have been found on the fetal side of placentas, indicating that unborn babies are directly exposed to the black carbon produced by auto emissions and fuel burning, research published in the journal Nature Communications showed.\n\nThe research is the first study to show the placental barrier can be penetrated by particles breathed in by the mother. The link between dirty air and increased miscarriages, premature births and low birth weights is well established, but this study suggests the particles themselves may be the cause, not solely the inflammatory response the pollution produces in mothers.\n\nRead: Trump administration set to revoke California\u2019s power to limit vehicle emissions", "description": "Dispatches from the business of climate change.", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR549_greta__ZG_20190918130604.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
