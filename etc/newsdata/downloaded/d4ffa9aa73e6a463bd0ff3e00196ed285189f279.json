Rand Paul berated at Calif. restaurant: 'We're not putting up with your Republican bulls--t!'", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Rand Paul blasted \u201cincivility\u201d on the left after he was berated by a couple of New Yorkers in a California restaurant Friday.\n\nMr. Paul and his deputy chief of staff posted a 24-second clip of the exchange that has racked up more than 2 million views. In it, a man and a woman can be seen confronting the Kentucky Republican about his political leanings.\n\nWhile having lunch with @RandPaul in California, we got verbally assaulted by these aggressive libs complaining about incivility. Check out the vid! #unhinged pic.twitter.com/IdOTdc3pOC \u2014 Sergio Gor (@SergioGor) October 18, 2019\n\nThe video starts with the woman yelling, \u201cHe\u2019s not being rude!\u201d in defense of the man.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being rude,\u201d the man says.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a public official,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Paul. \u201cI have a right to speak to him.\u201d\n\nThe video then turns to the woman, who appears irate, saying, \u201cYou just ran into two people from New York, kiddo, and we are not putting up with your Republican bulls\u2014t!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I am saying,\u201d the man continues, calmly speaking to Mr. Paul, \u201cis that while you and I possibly, probably, don\u2019t have much in common politically, we are Americans. All right?\u201d\n\nThe video then cuts out. It\u2019s unclear what the couple was doing before a staffer presumably said they were being rude.\n\nMr. Paul retweeted the short clip as a defense of President Trump, writing, \u201cThe left blames incivility on @realDonaldTrump. Watch this video and decide who the rude ones are\u2026\u201d\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee tweeted Saturday that the couple who confronted Mr. Paul should get professional help for their \u201cuncorked rage.\u201d\n\nThese unhinged old loons screaming at @RandPaul are probably someone\u2019s grandparents. Do they hope their grandkids turn out like this? I actually feel sorry for them. Do they really think they are winning? Uncorked rage, hate, and vile. They need help. https://t.co/cCCrG5Rwiu \u2014 Gov.
