Gamers have some suggestions", "language": "en", "text": "Capcom might be looking to revive some of the older franchises it hasn\u2019t touched in a while. Gamers are happy to give them ideas because they\u2019re nothing if not wildly nostagic \u2014 even if some of these franchises have gone decades without signs of life.\n\nThe company\u2019s annual report describes Capcom\u2019s success with recent franchise entries like Devil May Cry 5, Resident Evil 2 Remake, and Monster Hunter World. One of its strategies for maintaining this prosperity is to \u201cawaken dormant intellectual properties,\u201d which kind of makes them sound like eldritch gods.\n\nGamers wasted no time giving them ideas. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen this level of nostalgia for Capcom titles in\u2026 ever. But now that it seems likely the company will be gauging public interests in its long-dead titles, many are coming forward to praise their old favorites. This brings back memories of the 2017 Activision earnings call when company execs professed shock at just how many gamers were eager for the re-release of Crash Bandicoot \u2014 the moment when I realized that it\u2019s the gamers with long memories, not avaricious publisher, who won\u2019t allow any decent game to die no matter how old it is.\n\nThe top contender, by my count, seems to be Dino Crisis. The last game in this series was released in 2003 \u2014 16 years ago \u2014 and yet gamers want to see it return. And I can see why: the original game made dinosaurs scary in the same way that Resident Evil did for zombies. I can see a modern remake using the same atmospheric techniques as the Resident Evil 2 remake. I could really use a game in which the mindless, ravenous enemy hordes aren\u2019t zombies, for once.\n\n2 words: Dino Crisis \u2014 Eliskor Sakura\u2694\ud83d\udee1| 4 days until Cold Steel III! (@Eliskor) October 17, 2019\n\nAnother popular choice is Darkstalkers, a 2D fighting game series. While Capcom has always thrown its weight behind its tentpole fighting series, Street Fighter, this series was fairly well-received at the time. It\u2019s remained popular enough that Capcom included at least two Darkstalkers characters in each entry of its Marvel vs Capcom series, including MvC: Infinite, the most recent game released in 2017. That\u2019s probably why the series has remained in the public conscience despite the last main entry in the series coming out on the original PlayStation in 1998.\n\nI'm just ecstatic over this news\n\nMaybe with this we'll get a good redemption arc from capcom, they said they were interested in bringing back old IPs and I'm guessing they're starting with reuniting clover studios and making okami 2.

It\u2019s a completely bonkers beat-em-up in which a dude beats up a fat disco Elvis, five short Power Rangers, and a gorilla luchador in order to defeat Satan \u2014 and even that\u2019s not doing it justice. Think of it as the more insane brother of Dead Rising, only directed by Shinji Mikami, the same person who gave us Resident Evil, Dino Crisis, and The Evil Within. Like I said\u2026 bonkers.\n\nSo, how about a new Darkstalkers? Or Viewtiful Joe? Or Breath of Fire?? https://t.co/FZNtBxha3A \u2014 Suffer Like QG Did (@QuartrGuy) October 17, 2019\n\nOther contenders include Breath of Fire (my boyfriend, a longtime BoF fan, gave me the biggest shit-eating grin when I mentioned this), Mega Man Legends, Viewtiful Joe, and probably a lot more the comments will remind me of.\n\nAlso, this may be unrelated, but Hideki Kamiya, (former Capcom designer and the man behind Bayonetta and Devil May Cry) just teased the return of another Capcom IP. Specifically, he appeared in a video on Twitter with designer Ikumi Nakamura and said \u201cOkami is going to be back.\u201d Capcom, which owns the rights to the deliriously beautiful action game, was tagged in the tweet. Whether this is a promise or a plea from the original developer is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nRead next: Gaming industry veteran on how the Store Wars will end", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F01%2Fre2review7.jpg&signature=dbdc56394078e5aee2e94234a7caa0b6", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
