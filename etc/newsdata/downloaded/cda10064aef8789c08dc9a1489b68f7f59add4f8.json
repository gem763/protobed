She was confirmed dead on Monday night.\n\nSince there are no written laws barring women from entering stadiums, Khodayari was charged for not fully adhering to Islamic hijab laws and covering her head.\n\nA campaigner for OpenStadiums, a movement fighting for female spectators in Iran, told Euronews: \u201cThere are no written rules that women are banned from stadiums, this is our big problem. If there are rules you can campaign against it.\n\n\"Instead, we are still paying the price for a decades-old clerical argument that the atmosphere in stadiums isn\u2019t suitable for women, that women are somehow responsible for a man\u2019s use of bad language or 'unsuitable' stadium conditions.\"\n\nThis hasn\u2019t always been the case, BBC World Service Journalist Ali Hamedani shared pictures of Iran\u2019s national women\u2019s swimming team published in the magazine Majaleh Zanen before the 1979 revolution. They were taken in the same Azadi stadium at which women are now prohibited from entering.\n\nMansoureh Mills, Amnesty International\u2019s Iran Researcher told Euronews: \u201cThere is no legislation in place, though since 1981 whilst it hasn\u2019t been written into law, the practice has been strictly enforced by Iranian authorities. They make all kinds of excuses - primarily they don\u2019t want men and women to mix, foul language and poor behaviour are all cited as reasons for the ban.\"\n\nWhilst in recent years women have attended a small handful of matches, Mills says \u201cthis was no more than a publicity stunt\".\n\n\"There were a limited number of seats, located in a cordoned area of the stadium, allocated to specific women,\" said Mills.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of criticism \u2014 the tickets went families of officials \u2014 many women tried to enter, but were turned away or arrested.\"\n\nThe exercise was nothing more than \u201cwindow dressing, intended to subdue international criticism\u201d.\n\nAmnesty has been documenting cases of women detained for attending games.\n\n\"The human rights situation has been seriously deteriorating, more and more women arrested for attending football matches, and forced hijab law protests, with harsher prison sentences. Iranian authorities are cracking down on public dissent and women\u2019s rights in general.\"\n\nKhodayari\u2019s death comes at a critical time, Iran is now the only remaining country to prohibit women access to spectator sports, with Saudi Arabia lifting the ban in 2018.\n\nLast year, President Hassan Rouhani promised FIFA President Gianni Infantino that women would be allowed full access to games.\n\nAn anonymous campaigner from OpenStadiums told Euronews of their encounter with Infantino: \u201cI told him this is our daily life, women are being interrogated and imprisoned, just for being advocates for this cause, you should be acting as fast as you can.\"\n\nIn June a letter by Infantino to Mehdi Taj, the president of Iran's soccer federation (FFIRI), initially set a July 15th deadline for Tehran to inform FIFA of \"concrete steps\" the federation would take to ensure that \"all Iranian and foreign women who wish to do so\" could attend World Cup qualification games, which start in September.\n\nIn response to Khodayari\u2019s death, President Rouhani's deputy for women affairs, Masoumeh Ebtekar, tweeted in Farsi her efforts to follow up on the case, saying the issue of allowing women to enter stadiums is being reviewed by the government and the judiciary.\n\nFIFA\u2019s statement, on the other hand, has drawn widespread criticism.\n\n\"FIFA conveys our condolences to the family and friends of Sahar and reiterates our calls on the Iranian authorities to ensure the freedom and safety of any women engaged in this legitimate fight to end the stadium ban for women in Iran,\" it added.\n\nOpenStadiums describe the statement as \u201csenseless\u201d, whilst Amnesty\u2019s Mansoureh Mills told Euronews FIFA\u2019s response was \u201cweak\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201cFIFA should have a stronger position, they have to take action, it\u2019s September and we haven\u2019t seen any progress\u2019\u2019.\n\nKhodayari's story has gained significant traction on social media. She has been dubbed the \"blue girl\" in reference to her favourite team\u2019s colours.\n\nAmongst the footballing community, Iran\u2019s National Team have openly pledged their support, whilst AS Roma symbolically changed their logo colours to blue.\n\nWhilst OpenStadiums is pleased with the social media response to Khodayari's story, \"whilst journalists and activists are speaking about Sahar\u2019s case - state media has been banned from reporting her death\".\n\n\u201cWe will have to wait and see, at the end of the day, this will be recorded in history that a girl set herself on fire and nothing happened. If this is truly the case, it's such a shame that FIFA and AFC did nothing\u2019\u2019.", "description": "Sahar Khodayari, an Iranian female football fan who tried to sneak into a stadium dressed as a man, has died after setting herself on fire last week.", "authors": ["Helena Skinner"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/14/69/58/1000x563_cmsv2_ab387618-f5dc-5d48-8aa1-4b032fb86a09-4146958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
