For the third quarter, cargo revenue increased 9% to $60 million and is up 15% to $169 million for the first nine months of 2019. Alaska's cargo business, however, is about a third to a quarter that of bigger competitors United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines.\n\nGroup net income was $326 million, up 37.5%, excluding modest merger-related charges and fuel hedging expenses, with earnings per share of $2.63 beating consensus estimates of $2.52.\n\nThe Seattle-based airline generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the nine-month period.\n\nMainline revenue per available seat mile grew 4.5% to 12.83 cents, and load factors crept up to 86.2%.\n\nImage by skeeze from Pixabay\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
