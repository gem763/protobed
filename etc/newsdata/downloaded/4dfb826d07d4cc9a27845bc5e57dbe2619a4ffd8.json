Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is leading his colleagues to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point at their meeting, for the second time in as many months, to cushion the U.S. economy against a slowdown from the U.S.-China trade conflict and weak growth abroad.\n\nTuesday\u2019s report runs counter to earlier signs of weakness in the industrial sector. Output at U.S. factories, which accounts for about 75% of the nation\u2019s total industrial output, rose 0.5% last month from July.\n\nJay Teeters, office manager at 310 Tempering LLC, said construction projects have boosted demand for the Louisville, Ky.-based maker of railings and shower doors. The company, which has around 60 employees, is looking to hire a few more, Mr. Teeters said.\n\n\u201cA lot of things are booming right now,\u201d he said. \u201cHotels are going up, projects are going up, businesses are renovating.\u201d\n\nFactory output has increased an average of 0.2% a month over the past four months, after declining an average of 0.5% a month during the first four months of the year, the Fed said. Still, from a year earlier, industrial production rose by a tepid 0.4% in August, while manufacturing declined by 0.4%.\n\nTuesday\u2019s report showed the mining index, which includes oil and natural gas extraction, increased 1.4% in August, after declining 1.5% in July as Hurricane Barry hit oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Output in the volatile mining sector was up 5.1% from a year earlier. Utility production increased 0.6% from July.\n\nHiring and consumer spending haven\u2019t lost significant momentum, suggesting domestic growth remains solid, though exports and business investment weakened in the second quarter as companies struggled with uncertainty surrounding the trade strife.\n\nElsewhere in the U.S. industrial sector, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index fell to 49.1 in August from 51.2 in July, signaling a likely contraction in manufacturing activity. That led some economists to question whether Tuesday\u2019s report signaled an aberration from the broadly downbeat trend.\n\n\u201cPretty much every bit of evidence points in that direction except for this one number,\u201d said MFR Inc. economist Joshua Shapiro, who added that \u201cwhen you look at what manufacturers are saying, [the industrial production data] doesn\u2019t really jibe.\u201d\n\nThough manufacturing accounts for a small share of gross domestic product, the sector is highly sensitive to shifts in global demand, making it a bellwether for the broader U.S. economy.\n\n\u2014Austen Hufford contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "description": "A measure of U.S. factory, mining and utility output increased, a welcome sign of resilience after recent some other weak economic indicators.", "authors": ["Harriet Torry"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107500/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
