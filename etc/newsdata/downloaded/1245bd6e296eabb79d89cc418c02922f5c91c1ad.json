And it\u2019s coming from the right. It\u2019s like body odor: if you smell it all the time, it\u2019s probably you.\u201d\n\nThis prompted the acerbic comic to make a case for supporting Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden even if he \u201crapidly declines and legit loses his mind,\u201d telling Republicans: \u201cI am going to pretend \u2018nothing to see here,\u2019 just like you\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\nMaher would go on to encourage Democrats to vote for Biden even if he devolves from the current \u201cmildly embarrassing gaffe machine who mixes up stories and waits 'til he\u2019s onstage for his eyeball to explode and his dentures to fall out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat guy would not be nearly broken and crazy enough to teach the Republicans the lesson they need to learn,\u201d he noted. \u201cFor this, I need Joe Biden to be full-on, forgot-to-wear-pants, crumbs-in-the-hair, screaming-at-the-toaster nuts!\u201d\n\nMaher continued: \u201cAnd when Republicans say, \u2018Wait a minute, how can you give unwavering support for someone who\u2019s clearly lost it?\u2019 I\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t know, you tell me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe veteran comedian told his audience that in private, they\u2019ll go ahead and admit that their guy is nuts, but publicly they\u2019ll be in full denial mode, pointing to Fox Business host Stuart Varney\u2019s assertion that Trump has never lied as a prime example of how to act.\n\nRolling his eyes at Varney\u2019s obsequiousness, Maher said he wanted to see Biden do \u201cevery fucked-up thing a celebrity ever did\u201d\u2014such as wear a meat dress or interrupt Taylor Swift at an awards show\u2014just so he could tell Republicans that Biden\u2019s \u201ca different kind of president.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after he plows the presidential limousine through a farmer\u2019s market, I\u2019ll say, \u2018Why so upset, Republicans? That\u2019s just Biden being Biden,\u2019\u201d Maher concluded.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
