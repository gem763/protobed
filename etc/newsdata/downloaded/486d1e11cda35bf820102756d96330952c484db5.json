Leaders from around the world, including the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron; and India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, are expected at the summit as part of a major UN push to heighten the response to the escalating climate crisis.\n\nUN sources said the booking of the room was relatively last minute and will cause some logistical issues given the major security operation that accompanies the US president wherever he goes. But a senior UN official said they were \u201cnot panicked\u201d given the large organizational capacity of the UN general assembly.\n\n\u201cNo one was really expecting the president to come to the climate summit,\u201d the official said. It\u2019s understood that senior UN staff have realistic expectations of Trump and do not expect him to engage on the climate crisis, even for a summit held in his home town. Trump has vowed the US will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll clog up the whole system,\u201d said Mary Robinson, former Irish president and ex-UN high commissioner for human rights. \u201cHe won\u2019t go to the climate summit and he wants the distraction factor, I suppose.\u201d\n\nEven if Trump were to attend it is unlikely he would have been called to the podium to speak. Representatives from about 60 countries are expected to address the UN on Monday on the further commitments they are making to slash greenhouse gas emissions and deal with the flooding, storms and other impacts of global heating.\n\nThe speakers will outline \u201conly the best plans, only the most committed leaders will be on the stage\u201d, according to Luis Alfonso de Alba, the UN\u2019s special envoy for the climate summit.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s presence in the UN building, at a time when climate protests swept around the world on Friday, will prove provocative. \u201cNot participating and yet showing up at the building is throwing down a gauntlet,\u201d said David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s most importantly a snub to the young people pleading for action on climate change. Donald Trump has made very clear internationally and domestically he has no interest in the science or this issue. It\u2019s up to the rest of the world to get on with its business.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the White House for comment.", "description": "Exclusive: Senior UN official confirms White House booked a room so Trump can attend a gathering in same building as the summit", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7d3f2051ab5d42da6ac6c64b133bda02f1bb650/0_350_5376_3226/master/5376.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=015d54a430bc56d9233178c8dd781267", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
