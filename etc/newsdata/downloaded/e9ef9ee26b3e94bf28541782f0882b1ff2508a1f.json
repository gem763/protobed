(Screenshot: WTOL)\n\nA hired actor at a haunted house breached protocol when she drew on a customer and rubbed a spit-covered toy on her face, according to the attraction\u2019s owner.\n\nLast week, Haley Jones visited Haunted Hydro in Fremont, Ohio, a \u201cdark attraction park\u201d that features escape rooms, haunted woods, fire acts and exhibits. After her visit, Jones told Toledo news station WTOL that, while standing in a line, an employee who was playing a role there got a little too close.\n\n\"Basically I think an actor wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do with us, or was uncomfortable in her role, and she ended up popping this weird toy in her mouth and taking it out and wiping it all over my face with just her spit,\u201d said Jones. \u201cAnd then she took a Sharpie marker to my face as well.\u201d\n\nHaunted Hydro does offer a \u201ctouch pass\u201d option where customers agree to an \u201cinteractive\u201d thrill with the most experienced actors. However, this year, the passes aren\u2019t available, owner Bob Turner tells Yahoo Lifestyle, saying that it takes weeks of intensive training for actors to execute the experience. Without that touch pass, actors must stay one arm\u2019s length away from guests at all times.\n\n\"We did not get touched in the house. It was just in the outside line, but we didn't think we were going to get touched by the actors, so it was a little bit concerning,\" Jones told WTOL.\n\nJones\u2019s incident with the employee was not an approved act. \u201cSometimes we have guest actors from other haunts that are not fully aware of our rules and regulations,\u201d Turner tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWe did have a patron call us and inform us of this issue. We reprimanded the actor and made it very clear this type of scare has never been the style of the Haunted Hydro. We already have apologized to the patron and took care of this situation internally.\u201d\n\nEmployees are always put through a three-day \u201cFear Camp\u201d which teaches protocol for makeup, costumes, acting, and safety measures, says Turner, and the business employs an on-site EMT and off-duty firemen.\n\nJones says that hereafter, she will speak up if she feels uncomfortable. \"I would say just next time I will be more aware, and if someone is touching me without signing a form I'd be more inclined to be like 'hey, don't do that.' Whereas that time I just was kind of unsure what was going on and if they normally do that here or whatnot.\u201d\n\nYahoo Lifestyle could not locate Jones for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A paid actor at a haunted house in Ohio was apparently too touchy with a customer.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CSUPofAzbARCU0Np2gJyow--~B/aD0xNTc4O3c9Mjg3NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d16c7960-f039-11e9-bfbf-98c140a16eb7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
