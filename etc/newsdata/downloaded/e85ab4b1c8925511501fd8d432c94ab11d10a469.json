USA TODAY\n\nFlorida's win over Auburn was the talk of the conference in Week 6. The Gators' reward is a trip down to the bayou to face red-hot LSU. Gators like swamp lands, right? We'll find out for sure Saturday night.\n\nBefore Florida and LSU battle at Death Valley, Texas A&M hosts Alabama at Kyle Field. That game isn't expected to be nearly as good, but it's a meeting of two ranked SEC teams regardless.\n\nHere's where those four programs plus the other 10 in the conference stand in this week's SEC Power Rankings.\n\n1. Alabama (5-0, 2-0 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 1\n\nSomehow, Texas A&M enters this weekend's game with a better overall defense than Alabama. While Bama's defense hasn't been as formidable as it usually is, that statistic probably won't stand at the end of the week. Crimson Tide junior quarterback Tua Tagovailoa will have something to say about it.\n\nUp next: Saturday at No. 21 Texas A&M, 3:30 p.m. ET, CBS.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nRE-RANK: Ohio State takes over as the latest No. 1 in NCAA Re-Rank 1-130\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 6 in college football\n\n2. Georgia (5-0, 2-0 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 2\n\nGeorgia nearly took a deficit into halftime against Tennessee. Then the Bulldogs won by 29. The Bulldogs are just going through the motions at the moment, and that's fine until Nov. 2. That's when they clash with No. 7 Florida. Until then, Georgia has South Carolina and Kentucky.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. South Carolina, noon, ESPN.\n\n3. LSU (5-0, 1-0 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 3\n\nMore important than senior quarterback Joe Burrow continuing his Heisman campaign was LSU's dominant defensive performance in holding Utah State to 159 total yards. Now Burrow has a chance for another signature Heisman moment with a prime time matchup against Florida.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. No. 7 Florida, 8 p.m., ESPN.\n\n4. Florida (6-0, 3-0 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 5\n\nBeating Auburn is one thing. Beating LSU pm tj ewould be another. We've said it before, and we'll say it again: the gap between No. 3 and No. 4 in these rankings has been incredibly large all year. Florida can prove us wrong with a colossal road win over the Tigers.\n\nUp next: Saturday at No. 6 LSU, 8 p.m., ESPN.\n\nFlorida Gators head coach Dan Mullen walks off the field after defeating the Auburn Tigers at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.

A week after looking like Superman against Mississippi State, freshman quarterback Bo Nix looked incredibly human against Florida in throwing three interceptions. Auburn's offensive deficiencies are in danger of being exposed by the elite teams in the conference. With LSU, Georgia and Alabama still on the schedule, losing to Florida might be a sign of things to come for the Tigers.\n\nUp next: Oct. 19 at Arkansas.\n\n6. Missouri (4-1, 1-0 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 6\n\nTroy went into its game against Missouri averaging 510.8 yards per game and 6.5 yards per play. Mizzou held the Trojans to 211 yards and 3.2 yards per play. Missouri has the best total defense in the conference, and it's not even close. The Tigers give up roughly 50 yards less than the next closest team, Florida.\n\nSenior quarterback Kelly Bryant just had his highest-rated game of the season, too. Look out in the East?\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Mississippi, 7 p.m., ESPN2.\n\n7. Texas A&M (3-2, 1-1 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 7\n\nThe ESPN College GameDay crew took to Instagram to make a short video mocking Texas A&M for not being able to win \"big games\" at Kyle Field.\n\n\"Why do we build it up?\" Kirk Herbstreit said. \"I'm not doubting that it's a great environment. I'm saying, is it an intimidating environment?\"\n\n\"No,\" Chris 'Bear' Fallica said. \"You would think it is, the stadium is, but they don't seem to win big games.\"\n\nBall is in your court with No. 1 Alabama in town, Aggies.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. No. 1 Alabama, 3:30 p.m., CBS.\n\n8. Mississippi State (3-2, 1-1 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 8\n\nMississippi State has to beat Tennessee at Neyland Stadium this weekend. No way around it. If the Bulldogs falter, then the panic button gets hit in Starkville. Head coach Joe Moorhead will have critics to answer at every turn, and rightfully so.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Tennessee, noon, SEC Network.\n\n9. Mississippi (3-3, 2-1 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 11\n\nThe Rebels are fighting tooth and nail to become bowl eligible for the first time since 2015. It'll be tough for Ole Miss to get there though as the team is only favored in one of its remaining six games. If the Rebs do sneak out with two wins in their next five, then a sixth win will be on the line in the Egg Bowl.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Missouri, 7 p.m., ESPN2.\n\n10. South Carolina (2-3, 1-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 9\n\nThe best the Gamecocks can hope for in the next two weeks is to just look competitive. With back-to-back games against Georgia and Florida on the schedule, nobody is expecting two wins. Just don't get blown out.\n\nUp next: Saturday at No. 3 Georgia, noon, ESPN.\n\n11. Kentucky (2-3, 0-3 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 10\n\nIs there a team as desperate in the SEC as Kentucky? Shoot, maybe there is. The one the Wildcats are playing this weekend. Shoot, maybe there's another -- the one right below Kentucky in these rankings. Shoot, one more on top of that -- the one at the very bottom of these rankings.\n\nOK, there are some desperate teams in this league, but Kentucky badly needs a win if it wants to reach a bowl game for the fourth consecutive season. Playing Arkansas at home is a perfect opportunity for one.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Arkansas, 7:30 p.m., SEC Network.\n\n12. Tennessee (1-4, 0-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 12\n\nTennessee got drubbed again, but something positive might've happened in the process. The Vols seem fairly certain they found a potential quarterback of the future in freshman Brian Maurer, who threw for 259 yards and two touchdowns against Georgia.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Mississippi State, noon, SEC Network.\n\n13. Arkansas (2-3, 0-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 13\n\nWhat can you say about Arkansas in a week in which the Hogs didn't even play? Two weeks ago, the Razorbacks *almost* beat Texas A&M. Who'd be shocked if they *almost* beat Kentucky on the road this week but walked away with another loss instead?\n\nNobody.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Kentucky, 7:30 p.m., SEC Network.\n\n14. Vanderbilt (1-4, 0-3 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 14\n\nA honest question that can be asked of any of the bottom-three teams in these rankings: Will any of them win a conference game this season? Vanderbilt and Tennessee go head-to-head in the final game of the season. For all the marbles!\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. UNLV, 4 p.m., SEC Network.", "description": "This week's SEC power rankings saw a change in the top five as Florida jumped Auburn after beating Tigers at home.
