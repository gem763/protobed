Col. Alexander Vindman testified about what he heard in Trump's controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president, he appeared as a 10-year-old boy in a documentary about immigrants in America.\n\nA clip from acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns' Academy-Award nominated 1985 documentary The Statue of Liberty has been unearthed by the Washington Post and features a 10-year-old Vindman with his twin brother, Yevgeny.\n\nThe boys are seen sitting on a bench in Brighton Beach, New York, when one tells the camera they're from Russia and the other says they're from Kyiv, now the capital of Ukraine.\n\n'Our mother died, so we went to Italy,' one of the Vindman boys says, 'And then we came here.'\n\nThis comes as Vindman - a Purple Heart veteran and White House official - is being questioned over his allegiance to the U.S. in the wake of his testimony about the call.\n\nAs @pbump of @washingtonpost unearthed today, Army Lt. Col. Vindman, who is testifying before Congress today, was featured as a young boy in the @KenBurns Academy Award-nominated doc \"The Statue of Liberty\" in 1985.\n\n\n\nWatch the full clip on UNUM here: https://t.co/aLDj0Fpjsx pic.twitter.com/QAMe6BjkAL \u2014 UNUMKenBurns (@UNUMKenBurns) October 29, 2019\n\nA clip from acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns' documentary The Statue of Liberty shows Vindman and his twin brother shortly after arriving to the U.S.\n\nVindman testified the White House omitted key words and phrases from the transcript of Trump's call with President Zelensky of Ukraine\n\nDirector Ken Burns tweeted Tuesday the Vindmans' story is 'America at its best'\n\nDirector Ken Burns tweeted Tuesday, 'I remember the Vindman boys fondly. Theirs is the story of America at its best.'\n\nThe Vindmans were three years old when they arrived from the former Soviet Union to the U.S. and have since dedicated their lives to serving America, with Vindman declaring in his opening statement Tuesday that it is his 'sacred duty' to defend the United States.\n\n'Our mother died, so we went to Italy,' one of the Vindman boys says in the documentary, 'And then we came here'\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, both Alexander and Yevgeny Vindman ended up working for the White House under President Trump, served in the U.S. Army, and now work for the National Security Council.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped right wing political pundits from questioning Vindman's loyalty to the U.S. as he now appears to be a new threat to President Trump.\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham attacked Vindman on her show Tuesday night, suggesting he is un-American.\n\n'Here we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House, apparently against the president's interests, and usually they spoke in English,' Ingraham said. 'Isn't that kind of an interesting angle on the story?'\n\nHer guest John Yo, who worked in the George W. Bush administration went as far as to call it 'astounding' and 'espionage'.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to denounce the probe as a 'sham,' adding: 'Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER!'\n\nFox and Friends' host Brian Kilmeade painted Vindman as a Ukraine sympathizer. 'We also know he was born in the Soviet Union, immigrated with his family, young. He tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine,' he said.\n\nCNN commentator Sean Duffy suggested Vindman has an 'affinity' for Ukraine, saying: 'He speaks Ukrainian. He came from the country and he wants to make sure they're safe and free.'\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to denounce the probe as a 'sham,' adding: 'Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call'\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham attacked Vindman on her show Tuesday night, labeling him un-American\n\nVindman insists Zelensky specifically mentioned Burisma Holdings, telling investigators he tried to have the White House's transcript changed to include the missing reference\n\nVindman was the first current White House official to testify before the impeachment panels, after being issued a subpoena.\n\nHe said in his opening statement: 'My family fled the Soviet Union when I was three and a half years old. Upon arriving in New York City in 1979, my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while learning English at night.\n\n'He stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country. For many years, life was quite difficult. In spite of our challenging beginnings, my family worked to build its own American Dream.\n\n'I have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and the power of freedom. I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics.'\n\nHe went on to tell House impeachment investigators that the White House transcript of the July call between Trump and Ukraine's president omitted crucial words or phrases that he tried, but failed, to restore.\n\nDressed in his dark blue Army uniform with military medals displayed proudly across his chest, Vindman didn\u2019t suggest a motive behind the editing process during his more than 10-hour testimony Tuesday, though his claims will likely prompt investigators to further scrutinize how officials handed the call\n\nSuch omissions, Vindman said, included Trump\u2019s proclamation that there were recordings of former Vice President Joe Biden discussing Ukrainian corruption, and the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, directly mentioning the energy company who employed Hunter Biden to its board, Burisma Holdings\n\nThe omissions, Vindman said, included Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky mentioning by name the energy company that once employed Hunter Biden to its board, Burisma Holdings.\n\n'He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue,' the White House's transcript quotes Zelensky saying.\n\nHowever, Vindman insists Zelensky specifically mentioned Burisma, telling investigators he tried to have the White House's transcript changed to include the missing reference but the amendment was never made.\n\nThe rough transcript also contains ellipses in three instances where Trump is talking, which again Vindman says he tried to amend. He told investigators the third set of ellipses relates to Trump speaking about alleged recordings of former Vice President Joe Biden boasting about illegal Ukraine funding.\n\nVindman, who was listening in on the call from the White House Situation Room along with other members of Vice President Pence\u2019s staff, said he was so 'concerned by the call' \u2014 and the idea the president\u2019s request could be seen as 'a partisan play' that could 'undermine U.S. national security' \u2014 that he reported it to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\n\n\u2018I was concerned by the call,\u2019 Vindman said. \u2018I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\u2019", "description": "A clip from acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns' documentary The Statue of Liberty shows Vindman and his twin brother shortly after arriving to the U.S. in the 1980s.", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/13/20378126-0-image-a-12_1572443722635.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
