But I think it was an impossible situation to look after our players in the way they wanted to be looked after, and look after the staff in the way they wanted to be looked after.\n\n\u201cAnd also to everything else that we might have done. So I think we\u2019ve tried to maintain some dignity, we\u2019ve had the game stopped twice and we\u2019ve made everybody in Europe and around the world aware that this is an issue that we weren\u2019t prepared to accept, and the players have made a massive statement with their football as well.\u201d\n\nSouthgate and England captain Harry Kane have been adamant that they would follow UEFA\u2019s strict three-step protocol rather than walk off. They had a players\u2019 meeting last week when every single player said they wanted to follow the guidelines should there be racist abuse.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\nThe Football Association have been quick to praise referee Ivan Bebek for his handling of the situation on the night but Bulgaria were already under a UEFA punishment of having part of the stadium closed from a previous racist offence.\n\nThat has led Southgate to urge UEFA to take stronger action because their punishments have not been working.\n\nSouthgate added: \u201cI think I have to give our organisation credit in that right from the moment we walked off the pitch in Montenegro, we reviewed what happened there, we knew that we needed to be better prepared as a group of staff to support the players the best we could.\n\n\u201cSo, I couldn\u2019t have felt more strongly supported by the chairman, chief executive and federation, and I think the players have felt that. UEFA were definitely on alert tonight and the fourth official and the referee and linesmen were on alert. So I think it\u2019s as big an operation as there has been.\n\n\u201cThe sad reality is that we weren\u2019t able to stop incidents happening, and so now something clearly within the investigation has got to take that next step with regard to that, because it\u2019s remarkable to have such a spotlight on a game and for that all to happen. But sadly, from a societal perspective, that seems to be what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d", "description": "England's Euro 2020 qualifier with Bulgaria was stopped twice after racist abuse, but Gareth Southgate insists they were right not to walk off", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586643.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
