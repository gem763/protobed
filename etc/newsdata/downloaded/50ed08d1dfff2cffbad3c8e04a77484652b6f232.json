The reward for TV geeks whose predictions pan out at the 71st annual Emmy Awards: no trophy, but bragging rights.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fun of cheering your favorites and rooting against their competitors. Conflicted feelings may loom for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans who loved the series, hated its finale. HBO\u2019s fantasy saga headed into the ceremony with a record 32 nominations, collecting 10 awards at last weekend\u2019s creative arts ceremony for technical and other achievements.\n\nIf the series adds three more wins on Sunday, it will break its own record for most awards in a season, 12, which it earned in 2015 and again in 2016. If it claims the top drama trophy, it will be its fourth and make it one of a handful of series to achieve that tally. It could also build on its record of the most Emmys ever for a drama or comedy series, now at 57.\n\n\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d is defending the top comedy award it captured last year, when three-time winner \u201cVeep\u201d was on hiatus. As with \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the political satire is entered for its final season and could benefit from voter sentiment as well as evident respect.\n\nSame goes for \u201cVeep\u201d star Julia Louis-Dreyfus, whose potential seventh Emmy for the show would combine with two others she\u2019s won to make her the most-honored performer in Emmy history.\n\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is competing in six categories besides best drama, including directing, writing and acting - with stars Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington vying for lead acting honors for the first time, and Peter Dinklage seeking his fourth supporting actor award.\n\nClarke\u2019s competition includes Sandra Oh of \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d who would be the first actress of Asian descent to win the Emmy, along with Oh\u2019s co-star Jodie Comer and past winner Viola Davis of \u201cHow to Get Away with Murder.\u201d A win for Clarke or any of the four \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actresses competing for a supporting trophy would be the first for a woman on the show.\n\nThe best drama actor field includes Billy Porter of \u201cPose,\u201d who would be the first openly gay man to win the award, and past winner Sterling K. Brown for \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d\n\nPresenters are set to include Angela Bassett, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hugh Laurie, Maya Rudolph, Jon Hamm, Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Randall Park. Actor-comedian Thomas Lennon has the off-camera job of regaling viewers with factoids and jokes as winners head to the stage.\n\nHalsey will perform during the in memoriam tribute.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.emmys.com .\n\n___\n\nLynn Elber is at [email protected] and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lynnelber\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Get the snacks and a scorecard ready for the 2019 Emmy Awards.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Lynn Elber"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/2019_primetime_emmy_awards_-_press_preview_day_22198_c0-171-4822-2982_s1770x1032.jpg?47fd783b2a12f23e67886f3de7eef0662a9fee6f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
