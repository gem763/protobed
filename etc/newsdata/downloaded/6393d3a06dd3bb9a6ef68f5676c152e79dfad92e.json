I have no idea if you are getting these notes.\n\n\n\nIf you are, send a signal and cut rates please. We could all do with the lift.\n\n\n\nLook, the finance minister\u2019s probably going to take it all back in higher taxes anyway, so cut us some slack.\n\n\n\nMost of us could do with a bit of a break \u2013 and the economy could really do with the equivalent of a Red Bull shot.\n\n\n\nThe Americans cut rates last night and more and more countries have negative interest rates. Ours are too high considering that inflation is well contained and growth is going to scrape through with 0.5%.\n\n\n\nMoody\u2019s is worried about growth and jobs, and while I know it\u2019s not your task to fix big problems in the economy, it would buy us some time while we fight about how best to create a sustainable future.\n\n\n\nI realise you guys are a conservative bunch over there at the Reserve Bank.\n\n\n\nYou will warn about the risk of a ratings downgrade, you will talk to South Africa\u2019s vulnerability as an oil importer following last weekends drone attacks in Saudi Arabia which have raised the risk of price increases at the petrol pump, you are worried about the spike in food prices and the fact that trade wars and the risk of a hard Brexit threaten to disrupt the global economy and will have a negative impact on us.\n\n\n\nCut the repo rate Governor! There will always be risks. That\u2019s the nature of our wild existence. South Africa needs more than just the joy of the Ndlovu Youth Choir\u2019s extraordinary performance at America\u2019s got Talent to lift us out of our funk.\n\n\n\nCut rates Governor. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nBruce Whitfield is a multi-platform award-winning financial journalist and broadcaster.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Bruce Whitfield:", "description": "I have no idea if you are getting these notes.
