And also that casual fans will simply look at Costa\u2019s physique and believe he\u2019s the guy who can defeat Adesanya.\n\n\u201cI like that fight because the casuals, they\u2019re dumb,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cThey see a beefed-up beefcake like that, and they think \u2018now that\u2019s the guy.\u2019 I\u2019m still all hype, by the way. I\u2019m still just a hype train. So they\u2019ll see that and think that\u2019s the guy, \u2018that\u2019s the guy.\u2019 They just want to see me lose, but they\u2019re going to be waiting for a long time.\u201d\n\nStill, though, while Adesanya seemed to want to pass this off as merely analytical, it\u2019s pretty obvious there\u2019s personal animosity not far beneath the surface during the post-fight posturing between the two.\n\n\u201c(I was trying to) sell the next fight a little bit, but at the same time, he\u2019s a (expletive). He\u2019s my (expletive),\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cI want to make him my (expletive). So that\u2019s why I did what I did.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, Adesanya will concede that Costa looks the role of a fighting champion, but he won\u2019t give him much credit in the skills department.\n\n\u201cHe looks good. He looks beefy. He looks like a swimsuit model, doesn\u2019t he? He\u2019s a handsome man,\u201d Adesanya said.\n\nBut when asked about Costa\u2019s skill level, he replied: \u201cBasic. Basic is just what I work on, my foundations. I have to work on my basic. He doesn\u2019t need \u2026 everyone that he fights is just a punching bag that stands there, just waiting to be hit. I can\u2019t wait to fight him. I\u2019m not impressed, to be honest.\u201d", "description": "To say UFC middleweight champ Israel Adesanya doesn't think too highly of Paulo Costa's skills would be an understatement.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Ken Hathaway", "John Morgan", "Blue Corner", "Mike Bohn", "Dave Doyle", "Mmajunkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/israel-adesanya-robert-whittaker-ufc-243-16.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
