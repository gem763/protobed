He is betting that he can create so much pressure on Iran that it buckles to American demands, while simultaneously making good on his promise to keep America out of any more \u201cendless\u201d Middle East wars.\n\nSo far, the gamble is working, much to the amazement of the president\u2019s critics. But the stakes in this international poker game are growing steadily higher, and the costs of losing the bet are rising along the way.\n\nThis gamble forms the backdrop for much of the activity at the United Nations this week, as world leaders gather for the annual opening of the U.N. General Assembly. In the run-up to the gathering, there were ample signs Iran was trying to provoke the U.S. into a military confrontation, thereby creating an international crisis that local leaders would have to swoop in to resolve, on terms more favorable to Iran than it can currently extract on its own.\n\nThis state of affairs\u2014Iran actually wanting a confrontation with the U.S.\u2014constitutes a world upside down. But there is little other way to read developments over recent months.\n\nAn attack on Saudi Aramco oil facilities has led to an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran. While Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are pointing to evidence Iran was involved. Here's what we know so far.\n\nTo summarize: The Trump administration pulled out of the internationally blessed nuclear deal with Iran and began imposing steadily escalating economic sanctions in an attempt to force Iran into negotiating a new, broader and tougher deal.\n\nTo the consternation of Iranian leaders, other nations have basically bowed to American economic power by going along with the sanctions. Iran\u2019s economy is buckling under the pressure. So it has tried to shake up the status quo, by attacking oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, by shooting down an American military drone and, most likely, by launching or at least arranging a dramatic strike at oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn short, Iran has been backed into a corner and needs to prove what it has always said: that it has the ability to shut down oil shipments out of the Persian Gulf, and that if it can\u2019t export its oil, others won\u2019t be allowed to do so either.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What\u2019s the best next step for the U.S. as risks grow in the confrontation with Iran? Join the conversation below.\n\nYet so far, U.S. officials believe, Iran has consciously stopped short of crossing red lines that might justify a full-bore American military response. It has carefully avoided killing any Americans and, in the case of the strike at Saudi oil installations, has tried to maintain plausible deniability by disclaiming authorship of the attack and pointing the finger at its allied Houthi forces in Yemen.\n\nThe goal appears to have been to create a crisis in world oil markets and perhaps even provoke a limited American military response that would produce a mad scramble among other world powers to step in and provide Iran economic relief, lest it do even more crazy things. Iran needs for the U.S. to be seen as the aggressor.\n\nSo far, that strategy hasn\u2019t worked. After a brief blip, oil markets have stabilized. President Trump hasn\u2019t responded with a military strike of his own, contrary to widespread expectations.\n\nInstead, U.S. officials say, Mr. Trump has other, less-dramatic options. He can further escalate economic pressure on Iran, which he has done by imposing new sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank, and can use covert actions and, potentially, cyber strikes.\n\nThe net result is that Iran appears more the military aggressor. Iran will try this week at the U.N. to create a new regional alliance to protect shipping in the Persian Gulf, a move designed to push the U.S. out of the picture, and has released a British oil tanker it seized previously to help ease the way for its initiative. Yet that isn\u2019t likely to work when Iran appears to be the party threatening shipping.\n\nSo, in the short run at least, Mr. Trump\u2019s approach is working. In the long run, though, things figure to get more dangerous\u2014probably much more dangerous, and soon.\n\nMr. Trump may have limited his leverage by showing how reluctant he is to use military action. Meantime, the steps Iran needs to take to provoke the crisis it appears to need likely will grow more extreme. Indeed, The Wall Street Journal has reported that Iran\u2019s Houthi allies in Yemen have warned foreign diplomats privately that Iran is preparing a new military strike.\n\nAt the same time, the steps Mr. Trump has taken so far\u2014ditching the nuclear deal and tightening the economic chokehold\u2014surely have strengthened hard-liners within the Iranian government, who have long argued it is folly to trust Washington.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, it\u2019s becoming less likely, not more likely, that Iran will agree to the step Mr. Trump really wants: the opening of direct, high-level negotiations on a new deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program and stop its support of radical forces in the region.\n\nIn sum, the risks in this confrontation, always high, are growing higher.\n\nWrite to Gerald F.
