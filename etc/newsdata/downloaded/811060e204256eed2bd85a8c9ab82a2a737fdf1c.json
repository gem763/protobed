The Washington Redskins return home from their first win of the year to face the undefeated San Francisco 49ers. Can they make it two W\u2019s in a row? Here\u2019s what to watch for.\n\nOpponent: San Francisco 49ers (5-0)\n\nWhere: FedEx Field, Landover, Md.\n\nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 20, 1 p.m.\n\nTelevision: Fox\n\nRadio: The Team 980, ESPN 630AM\n\nWhat to watch for:\n\n- Adrian Peterson had his best outing of the season with 118 yards on 23 carries (5.1 yards per rush). After offensive line coach Bill Callahan was elevated to interim head coach and announced he wanted a heavier focus on the run, should fans be surprised by this output? No. The real question is whether that was a one-time fluke against a Dolphins team that can\u2019t do anything right, or whether the Redskins can replicate that effort.\n\n- Speaking of Callahan, the signs at FedEx Field will no longer say \u201cFire Jay Gruden\u201d \u2014 but they might still say \u201cFire Bruce Allen.\u201d One win surely won\u2019t appease a home crowd hungry for big change. Even in Miami last week, a Washington fan paid to have a plane fly a \u201cFire Bruce Allen\u201d banner over the stadium. Will Redskins fans wear bags over their heads, as some did a week ago? As the season nears its midpoint, taking the fan base\u2019s temperature is a worthwhile exercise.\n\n- The 49ers, quarterbacked by Jimmy Garoppolo, are 5-0 and the surprise of the year in the NFL. They\u2019ve gotten there with sound all-around football \u2014 the 49ers are second in the league in total defense and fourth in total offense, including second in rushing offense. Garoppolo is rarely sacked and averages 8.0 yards per attempt. Shanahan, Washington\u2019s offensive coordinator once upon a time, said this week that the only good thing about working for the Redskins was working for his father \u2014 the worst part was \u201ceverything else.\u201d Yikes.\n\nPre-game reading:\n\nAlex Smith reveals he had more leg surgeries than first reported - a lot more, @thomloverro writes. #Redskins https://t.co/8fekCnfqDW \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) October 16, 2019\n\n#Redskins reporter @Matthew_Paras dives into 5 rumored candidates to be Washington\u2019s next coach https://t.co/mjHKGvKALa \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) October 18, 2019\n\nThe #Redskins are finally generating pressure after a slow start to the season. @Matthew_Paras https://t.co/kai6OciWCo \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) October 17, 2019\n\nKyle Shanahan throws shade at #Redskins ahead of showdown with his undefeated 49ers, by @Matthew_Paras https://t.co/kQHnZcsRWQ \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) October 17, 2019\n\nIn the midst of a #Redskins season that couldn\u2019t be much worse, thank goodness for Terry McLaurin, @DeronSnyder writes. https://t.co/OFyATbtuN9 \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) October 15, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
