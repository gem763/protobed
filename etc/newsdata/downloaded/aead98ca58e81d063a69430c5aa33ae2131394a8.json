Previously Netflix held that dominant 37% share, and YouTube only 32%.\n\nCable came in third place, with 12% of teens spending most of their time on that platform, followed by Hulu (7%) and Amazon (AMZN) Prime (3%).\n\n(Source: Piper Jaffray) More\n\nThe key reasons for Netflix losing ground came down to the fact that YouTube simply had so many different types of content, the researchers said.\n\n\u201c[W]e believe YouTube's more varied content library is a significant driver. Specifically \u2026 while YouTube does offer movies and other scripted content for a fee, the YouTube library includes music videos, video game streaming, DIY guides, social media influencer videos and other crowd sourced content,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe most subscribed-to user channel on YouTube is Bollywood channel T-Series, followed by PewDiePie, and CoCoMelon, according to social-media tracker Socialblade.com.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all bad news for Netflix, they added: \u201cWe believe Netflix continues to maintain strong teen mind share and attribute the position switch with YouTube at least partially to core differences between the content.\u201d\n\nAnd with the rise of other subscription services like Disney+ (DIS) and Apple TV+ (AAPL), \u201cthere will be increasing competition\u2026 and unforeseen hurdles,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cBut we believe the market will support multiple large players, with Netflix leading the way.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nAarthi is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
