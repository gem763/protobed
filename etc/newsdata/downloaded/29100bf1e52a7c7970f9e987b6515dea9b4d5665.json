Rates were expected to increase to 30 percent.\n\nIt is unclear what the United States will give up as part of the phase one deal. On Friday, Trump said the terms will be written up over the course of three to five weeks. Phase two negotiations are expected to begin immediately after the first piece is signed.\n\nTrump seemed optimistic about the negotiations that took place last week, saying in a tweet on Friday that \u201cgood things\u201d were happening amid \u201cwarmer feelings,\u201d alleging that everyone would like to see \u201csomething significant happen.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP", "description": "Some caution against taking the deal at face value.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Trump-Rally-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
