Now, many of those models have made their public debuts at the show and will be heading to dealerships soon.\n\nVolkswagen AG , the world\u2019s largest auto maker, rolled out a new all-electric compact car Tuesday called the ID.3, while sports car maker Porsche showed off the Taycan, a powerful, four-door sedan that runs on battery power only.\n\nMercedes-Benz, the luxury car brand owned by Daimler AG , unveiled a concept for a full-electric version of its flagship S-class sedan at this week\u2019s motor show, which is among the world\u2019s largest. Honda launched a battery-electric hatchback designed for city driving, and even Lamborghini, a maker of Italian supercars, revealed its first hybrid model.\n\nThe unveilings were coupled with pledges that more hybrid and plug-in models were on the way as chief executives said this was only the beginning in a broader push to electrify large parts of their lineups.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What would you still hope to see be improved on electric cars? Join the conversation below.\n\nHowever, with prices still high and consumer demand lukewarm for electrics, industry executives called on European governments for assistance, asking for tax subsidies and regulatory incentives to make the cars more affordable and appealing to buyers.\n\n\u201cThe electric car will not make its way naturally. Incentives will play a huge role,\u201d Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess said.\n\nElectric-car sales in Europe, which has some of the world\u2019s toughest emissions requirements, are still anemic. In the first half of this year, full electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles accounted for just 2.4% of overall vehicle sales in the European Union.\n\nGlobally, the market for electric cars also remains a tiny niche, but car companies and their parts suppliers say they have little choice but to shift the bulk of their research budgets to battery-powered models.\n\nTougher emissions rules in Europe, China and the U.S. make it difficult for companies to hit the targets for reducing tailpipe air-pollutants without selling more electrified models. That\u2019s prompted many auto makers to pour money into battery technology and building out a network of roadside chargers to support refueling.\n\nVolkswagen, for instance, has invested nearly $1 billion in Swedish startup Northvolt AB to build a battery factory in Germany.\n\nAuto makers such as Daimler and BMW AG have seen their profits swoon under the weight of the huge investments made in electric cars, but say there is no alternative.\n\n\u201cWe have to invest and we are better placed than some to pay the price. Electric cars do not come for free,\u201d BMW Chief Finance Officer Nicolas Peter said.\n\nProducing an electric car generally costs $12,000 more than making a comparable gasoline car and parity won\u2019t be reached for about five years, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co. The battery alone costs between $5,500 to $7,700 per vehicle, Volkswagen\u2019s Mr. Diess said.\n\nWithout a major technological breakthrough, auto makers recognize they will have to rely on building volume and economies of scale to help bring prices down.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in our minds we have to drive these costs down over the next many years,\u201d Daimler AG\u2019s CEO Ola Kallenius said. \u201cYou cannot exactly influence what customers will buy.\u201d\n\nThe International Motor Show Germany IAA 2019 has a special focus on electric cars, such as this Porsche Taycan.

KRISZTIAN BOCSI/BLOOMBERG NEWS\n\nThe electric-cars showing in Frankfurt this week contrast sharply with auto shows in Detroit and New York earlier this year, where SUVs and pickup trucks took center stage and fewer plug-in models made their debuts.\n\nWhile auto makers are selling more electric models in the U.S., many buyers have taken advantage of low gasoline prices and purchasing large vehicles that consume more fuel, rather than less.\n\nMany of the latest electric-car models can travel 200 miles or more on a single charge\u2014a vast improvement from several years ago when 100 miles or less was more typical. The new VW ID.3, for instance, will offer a range of up to 550 kilometers, or 342 miles, depending on the battery option.\n\nBut even with the expansion of range, potential customers are still afraid of running down the battery on a longer journey and not having a place to plug in. While the situation has improved and new charging-station networks are under construction in Europe, so-called \u201crange anxiety\u201d and the steep price of electric vehicles remain the biggest obstacles, according to industry executives and analysts.\n\nGovernments in China and the U.S. already offer hefty incentives for electric-car buyers, but sales of hybrid and plug-in models remain a fraction of overall sales there.\n\nPorsche\u2019s North American President Klaus Zellmer said those psychological barriers to making the switch from gasoline to electric won\u2019t be easy to overcome. The hurdle involves \u201ca completely new technology,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s why the industry is calling on governments to lend a hand.\n\nHildegard Wortmann, Audi\u2019s board member in charge of sales, said Europe still has huge patches where drivers cannot charge their vehicles on the road.\n\nShe called on European governments to follow the example of Norway, where incentives such as tax rebates for buyers and free parking, have made it the first country to hit a tipping point: more than half of its vehicle sales are electric.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a look at Norway,\u201d Ms. Wortmann said. \u201cThis really small country has shown the rest of the world how it is done.\u201d\n\nWrite to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com and Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com", "description": "European auto makers have plowed billions of dollars into developing new hybrid and plug-in electric models.
