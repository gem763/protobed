But it cautioned that the names had yet to be checked against the rosters of people evacuated from the devastated islands or staying in shelters.\n\nCarl Smith, a spokesman for the country\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency, said he expected the list to shrink as the names are checked.\n\nMore than a week after Dorian smashed thousands of homes on the country\u2019s Grand Bahama and Abaco islands, the death toll stood at 50 and was expected to rise, with search-and-rescue crews still making their way through the ruins.\n\n\u201cThe number of deaths is expected to significantly increase,\u201d Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said in a national address Wednesday night.\n\nHe said the Bahamas would hold a national day of prayer, and named hurricane response coordinators for the two most-affected islands.\n\nWhile power has returned to much of Grand Bahama, Smith said the electrical infrastructure around Marsh Harbour, Abaco\u2019s largest city, was destroyed.\n\nIn Freeport, the largest city on Grand Bahama, rental car company driver Clifton Williams said he was driving home Monday when he saw an illuminated streetlight for the first time since the hurricane.\n\n\u201cI was happy to see that. I didn\u2019t expect that so quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst thing I do, I cut on the fan and cool off myself,\u201d he added, saying he slept well for the first time in more than a week thanks to the fan.\n\nOthers in Freeport didn\u2019t have power yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same as it was a week ago. It\u2019s very hot,\u201d said Samuel Antonio.", "description": "Carl Smith, a spokesman for the country\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency, said he expected the list to shrink as the names are checked.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR158_bahama_ZG_20190912055739.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
