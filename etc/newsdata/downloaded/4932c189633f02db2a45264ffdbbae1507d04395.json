Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) White House bid, calling her the \u201cbest candidate\u201d running for president in 2020.\n\n\u201cMy favorite \u2014 I\u2019m going to say it, we\u2019ll break news today \u2014 is Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Legend said in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair published Monday morning.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience,\u201d the All of Me crooner said of the senator.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?\u201d\n\nVanity Fair reports that Legend\u2019s wife, model-turned-left-wing activist Chrissy Teigen, also expressed \u201clove\u201d for Warren, but said she also thinks highly about 2020 White House contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).\n\n\u201cI also love Kamala Harris,\u201d Teigen said.\n\nAs part of their sit-down with Vanity Fair, Legend and Teigen, both outspoken critics of President Trump, called the president, \u201csad, and petty, and narcissistic and immature.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,\u201d Teigen told the magazine on the topic of the House Democrats\u2019 secret impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\n\u201cI feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office,\u201d she added. \u201cI know that his first tweet after he\u2019s impeached will be, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to be there anyway.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOf course, Legend and Teigen\u2019s criticisms of the president has not gone way one.\n\nLast month, President Trump took aim at the Hollywood couple for failing to credit his administration on enacting criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cWhen all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cI got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn\u2019t come close.\u201d\n\n[M]usician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2013 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. \u2018Anchor\u2019 @LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about,\u201d he added.", "description": "John Legend expressed\u00a0support for Elizabeth Warren's White House bid, calling her the 'best candidate\" running for president in 2020.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/Johnlegendgoogle1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
