I am pleased to report that this game looks like it is one thousand per cent my shit.\n\nIn Yes, Your Grace, you play as a king who needs to juggle the needs of the petitioners that come to his throne room. You\u2019ve also got to deal with the concerns of your family and handle alliances with foreign lands. Those are already daunting tasks, but this game also has magic and the arcane to deal with as well.\n\n\u201cInspired by Slavic folklore, Yes, Your Grace tells the tale of a medieval kingdom, where monsters and arcane practices are just a typical day at the office,\u201d reads the press release for Yes, Your Grace. At each word in this sentence, my eyebrows raised higher and higher, until they ejected from my face. Though I am now eyebrowless, I am also very excited for this game, which is coming to PC and consoles in 2020.\n\nIf you\u2019re not convinced, check out this trailer, featuring a medieval-arse banger from the band Merkfolk.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and are ravenous for any and every management sim you can get your hands on, you can sign up for the open beta in November by joining the Yes, Your Grace Discord channel. You don\u2019t have to tell me twice. I\u2019ll be right there, your grace!", "description": "Yes, Your Grace is an upcoming management sim that will put you in charge of a kingdom, and all of the witches, hunters and generals therein.
