The man later returns to the scene as police investigate.\n\nSome viewers were surprised the man returned to the scene, but others suggested he was trying to prevent one of the woman from being stabbed.\n\nAfter the fight ends a woman can be heard screaming repeatedly, while a group of onlookers watch on - although most appear to be unwilling to break it up.\n\nThe incident happened outside an Indian restaurant and grocery store on the corner of High Street North and Halley Road in Manor Park, near East Ham.\n\nPolice denied anyone was stabbed and said there were no reports of any serious injuries,\n\nA Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called at approximately 7.50pm on Wednesday, October 2 to reports of a number of people fighting in\n\n'Officers attended the scene.
