He had those pictures of me and he threatened to post them on social media so my friends and family would see if I didn\u2019t sent him videos and naked pictures of other girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I begged him and said I would do anything else. He kept putting more and more pressure on me and I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u2018I was frightened and I just wanted him to leave me alone. I didn\u2019t know what to do to make it all stop.\n\nMajor airport braces for significant disruption by climate protesters\n\n\u2018I was crying and shaking and thought of my friends and family seeing the pictures he had of me.\u2019\n\n\u2018I had thoughts of ending my life. I even tried to kill myself. I was only a child at the time. No child should ever have those thoughts.\u2019\n\nShe then took the brave decision to tell police about what had happened and detectives discovered Swift used a series of aliases and had targeted an adult with learning difficulties.\n\nHe was jailed for nearly four years for blackmail against the adult, but after the teenager came forward his sentence was extended for almost three more years.\n\nEating on public transport should 'be banned' says chief medical officer\n\nJudge Julie Clemitson told him: \u2018You threatened to post images, she had already sent you, on Facebook if she didn\u2019t send you the videos you wanted.\n\nBoris Johnson accused of 'using Queen' in pre-election 'stunt'\n\n\u2018Thankfully, she was sensible enough and perhaps mature enough to feel able to contact the police.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said the victim had been caused \u2018extreme anguish\u2019 and the effect on her \u2018cannot be overstated\u2019.\n\nJudge Clemitson added: \u2018Blackmail is a particularly despicable and loathsome offence because of the mental anguish it causes to the victim.\n\n\u2018Here, your victim was a child, that is the serious aggravating factor. \u2018You are clearly a sexual predator. You clearly pose a significant risk of sexual harm to girls and vulnerable women.\u2019\n\nHe was told he must sign the sex offenders register and is subject to a sexual harm prevention order for 10 years.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
