Devin Nunes, R-Calif., along with several other Republican members of the panel penned a letter to Schiff on Friday accusing him and other Democrats of not providing physical copies or uploading digital versions of documents related to the impeachment inquiry to the minority staff.\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TOLD CONGRESS HE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS IN 2015 BUT WAS IGNORED\n\n\u201cWe see no reason for your withholding of these documents except as a deliberate attempt to hinder the Minority\u2019s participation,\u201d they wrote Friday.\n\nNunes and fellow Republican members cited several documents, including letters from Democrats on the committee, sent to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and others. The Republicans also cited letters requesting depositions for several key officials.\n\nLater Friday, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., raised a similar issue with Schiff, along with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and House Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney\u2014who are also jointly spearheading the impeachment inquiry--calling for access to investigative materials.\n\n\u201cPlease make available all records, documents, transcripts and other materials related to or obtained in the course of the ongoing joint investigation between the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Committee on Oversight and Reform,\u201d Collins wrote, giving a deadline of Oct. 22.\n\nThe Republican complaints come amid the House\u2019s formal impeachment inquiry into the president, which was announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., earlier this month. Pelosi, though, has said the House will not vote at this point on whether to make the inquiry an official proceeding.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower complaint that said that Trump had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, over their business dealings in Ukraine\u2014specifically, why the elder Biden pressured the former Ukrainian president to fire a top prosecutor who was investigating a natural gas firm where Hunter sat on the board. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint stated their concerns that Trump was soliciting a foreign power to influence the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe president\u2019s request also came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, something critics have cited as evidence of a quid pro quo arrangement. The White House and the president\u2019s allies, though, have denied any sort of quid pro quo, and the Bidens have maintained that they did \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut with regard to the whistleblower, Nunes and House Intelligence Committee Republicans also blasted Schiff for determining that the panel did not need to receive testimony from that individual.\n\n\u201cGiven that you have recently acknowledged that the Committee no longer needs to receive testimony from the whistleblower, your \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019 lacks any relationship with the jurisdiction of this Committee,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAs you are aware, the Committee was established to conduct critical oversight of the Intelligence Community, and we are increasingly concerned our normal work is being overlooked in favor of partisan activities best suited for another Committee.\u201d\n\nSchiff did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.", "description": "Republican members of several House panels involved in the formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump are blasting House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff for withholding records related to their investigation from GOP lawmakers involved in the probe and demanding access.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
