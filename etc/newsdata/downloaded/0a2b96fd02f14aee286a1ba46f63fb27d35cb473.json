It is a completely artificial tax. It charges something for nothing. It creates artificial scarcity where there is none,\" he said.\n\n\"This approach is inconsistent with almost every other telecoms market around the world, where pricing doesn't penalise higher usage. It is inconsistent with the underlying cost of the product, which does not increase with greater usage. And it is inconsistent with consumer expectations for broadband at a fixed monthly price.\"\n\nUnless a change is made, Vocus would have no choice but to increase its pricing in line with NBN wholesale costs, Russell said.\n\nAs the leader of a budget ISP such as Dodo, Russell also went after NBN's discounting that set up 50Mbps as the standard usage tier.\n\n\"It helps explain why Telstra's broadband market share has jumped from 41% on ADSL to almost 50% on the NBN, and why the market share of value-providers has been slowly but steadily decreasing since the new pricing was introduced,\" he said.\n\nIn Febraury, Vocus said the variable nature of the CVC pricing model was incompatible with the fixed rates paid by consumers, and that the economics did not stack up.\n\n\"No profit margin after costs to migrate, acquire, and serve, together with backhaul and other admin and operational costs,\" the company said at the time.\n\nThe company said NBN pricing was \"simply too high\", and it was cashflow negative after providing modems and backhaul.\n\nVocus also pointed to the multi-technology mix of the NBN, saying the resultant inconsistent experience was another pain point.\n\nConsequently, the company said it would focus on selling NBN only where viable, and would shift towards fixed wireless and mobile solutions. Vocus pointed to non-NBN services being simpler with lower operating costs and 5G creating a path for business applications, as reasons for the switch.\n\nAlso speaking at the ACCAN conference on Thursday was NBN executive general manager for products Gavin Williams, who said the next round of pricing consultation would focus on affordability for low-income households, as well as getting seniors onto the NBN.\n\n\"It will involve, potentially, the creation of plans and programs to allow subsidisation of the cost of broadband connections to those who genuinely lack the capacity to pay for their broadband connection,\" he said.\n\n\"We are currently canvassing a range of options.\"\n\nWilliams also said NBN had seen an average 11Mbps lift on connection speeds by improving the in-home wiring of houses connected via fibre to the node.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nVocus network services and New Zealand covering for retail declines for FY19\n\nRevenue flat for the full year, while EBITDA declined 3%, and net profit fell 44%.\n\nNew Zealand ComCom lays charges against Vocus subsidiaries\n\nTelecommunications providers face charges for billing customers after contracts were terminated.\n\nVocus splits operations into three businesses after two failed takeover bids\n\nCompany admits it has underinvested for the past two years as it now seeks to streamline its product set.\n\nOptus takes wraps off customer concierge service to take NBN out of the equation\n\nSingle point of contact for customers moving onto NBN until 30 days after installation.\n\nTelstra announces AU$400m revenue downgrade in wake of NBN corporate plan\n\nWith NBN connecting less people next year, Telstra will get AU$300 million less in payments.", "description": "Vocus CEO Kevin Russell attacks the CVC as a download tax, saying the market value of NBN is far less than what it had cost to build.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/04/b8f7d86f-2190-4549-8b40-4f0c5b7e1866/thumbnail/770x578/b3490c19be4d3e2e83564c4ca8ad9ad0/broadband-cable-telco.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
