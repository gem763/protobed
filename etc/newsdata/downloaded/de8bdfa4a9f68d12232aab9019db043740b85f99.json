The usual list of suspects immediately challenged it in court and, predictably, the Ninth Circuit sided with them, claiming that the policy violated their constitutional rights. On Friday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal and render a final decision. (USA Today)\n\nOne of President Donald Trump\u2019s many efforts to crack down on asylum-seekers at the border is headed to the Supreme Court. The justices agreed Friday to consider the administration\u2019s effort to speed the removal of thousands of migrants without allowing them federal court hearings. A federal appeals court in California ruled earlier this year that efforts to remove asylum-seekers under \u201cexpedited review\u201d procedures violated their constitutional rights. The Justice Department argues that extending the streamlined process could add years of court wrangling.\n\nWe\u2019ll get to the prospects for this case in a moment, but first I wanted to take a look at the type of coverage this case is once again receiving in the mainstream press. The USA Today reporter depicts this policy the way we hear it portrayed on cable news and in the nation\u2019s larger newspapers on a regular basis.\n\nFirst of all, saying that we\u2019re \u201ccracking down on asylum-seekers\u201d is intentionally disingenuous. People who apply for asylum from their home country or even show up at an approved border crossing to submit a claim are still handled in the usual fashion. There may be unfortunately long delays because of the massive backlog in our courts, but their case will be head without penalty.\n\nWhat this policy is primarily doing is dealing with people who cross the border illegally and then, when apprehended, immediately try to make an asylum claim. That\u2019s not how the system is supposed to work.\n\nThe reporter goes on to state that the applicants are being removed more quickly without a federal court hearing. They\u2019re still going to get a hearing, albeit an \u201cexpedited\u201d one. And after they return to wait in Mexico, a normal court hearing date will be scheduled. But I suppose it doesn\u2019t sound as good for your target audience when it\u2019s described accurately.\n\nAs to the White House\u2019s prospects in this one, that\u2019s tough to say. The current Supreme Court justices have been rather hit and miss on immigration issues, though Trump has won several victories. Earlier this year the court agreed to uphold the policy where migrants would wait in Mexico for their court dates. But in 2018, a stricter policy that would flatly deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally was shot down.\n\nThis case seems far more similar to the former than the latter. The policy in question doesn\u2019t seek to flatly and preemptively deny asylum to an entire class of people. It simply seeks to ease some of the congestion in our detention facilities and ease the backlog in the courts. With that in mind, I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised to see the Ninth Circuit be overturned yet again and hand the Trump administration another win.", "description": "Once more into the breach", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BorderPatrol.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
