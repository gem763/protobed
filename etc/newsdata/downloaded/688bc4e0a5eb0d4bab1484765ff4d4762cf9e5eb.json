It is long past time for you to step down from your throne so the Democratic Party can lead with a new foreign policy which will actually be in the interests of and benefit the American people and the world.\"\n\n.@HillaryClinton, your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world. It\u2019s time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and step down from your throne. https://t.co/2cWI54lf6Y pic.twitter.com/h2fl7ox0Rv \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 22, 2019\n\nThe video comes after one Gabbard published on Sunday that explained she believed Clinton was targeting her because she supported Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election.\n\n\"People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my 'political career,'\" Gabbard said in the video. \"They said, 'Clinton will never forget,' that she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and the media will make sure that you are destroyed.\"\n\n\"If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone\u2014and in fact, that's exactly the message they want to get across to you,\u201d she continued. \"If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers\u2014if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.\"", "description": ".10/23/2019 10:54:37AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/25/cd3955ac-69a9-4c2b-8450-4db01cba9b7f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
