(AP) - There\u2019s no panic in the Dallas Cowboys just yet.\n\nThey know how things look from the outside, especially after a 24-22 loss to the previously winless New York Jets on Sunday. Their confidence, however, remains unshaken - even during a three-game skid.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change (anything),\u201d defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence insisted. \u201cNot at all. We know what happened today. We beat ourselves, just like last week.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s time to buckle down and get back going.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys are now 3-3 after starting with three straight wins, and they have a showdown with the NFC East-rival Philadelphia Eagles next Sunday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clean slate,\u201d quarterback Dak Prescott said. \u201cWe\u2019re 0-and-0 right now. We\u2019ve got a huge game next week. It\u2019s for first in our division. We\u2019ve got to figure out a way to turn this page and focus on that.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys haven\u2019t lost three in a row since the first three games of running back Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s six-game suspension in 2017.\n\nSlow starts, bad penalties and not enough big plays have downed Dallas the past few weeks, and it was more of the same against New York. They were also forced to play without starting offensive tackles La\u2019el Collins and Tyron Smith, and wide receiver Amari Cooper was sidelined for most of the game after injuring his quadriceps in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cWith injuries, without injuries, you can\u2019t get in your own way,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve continuously done. We\u2019ve got to figure out a way to do that. Great teams don\u2019t do that. Right now, we\u2019re far from that. We\u2019ve got to figure it out.\u201d\n\nThe Jets led 21-9 in the fourth quarter, but Prescott and the top-ranked Cowboys offense stormed back - and had a chance to tie in the wild closing moments.\n\nWith Dallas marching down the field, officials called six straight penalties during one stretch including four on the Jets putting the Cowboys in scoring position.\n\nPrescott ran for a 4-yard touchdown with 43 seconds left, making it a two-point game. Going for the tie, Prescott dropped back and was quickly met by a blitzing Jamal Adams and his pass on the conversion try fell short of Jason Witten in the end zone.\n\n\u201cI saw that they brought pressure, one more than we could protect,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cAll the way across the board, it\u2019s 50-50. I wouldn\u2019t change what I did right there. Obviously, I\u2019d get the ball up, try to absorb that hit better and make a better throw.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys tried an onside kick, but Demaryius Thomas recovered for the Jets (1-4), who won for the first time under coach Adam Gase.\n\nJets quarterback Sam Darnold, who missed three games while recovering from mononucleosis, finished 23 of 32 for 338 yards - including a 92-yard touchdown toss to Robby Anderson and a 5-yarder to Ryan Griffin.\n\nDarnold came out throwing in his first snap since the season opener and connected with Thomas for a 17-yard gain. Robert Quinn sacked him on the next play and the drive stalled. But, Darnold and the Jets got on the scoreboard on their second drive, capped Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s 2-yard touchdown run.\n\nDarnold was efficient on the 14-play, 83-yard drive, going 6 of 8 for 43 yards. New York was also helped by three penalties on Dallas, including a horse-collar tackle of Darnold by Maliek Collins on third-and-goal from the 7 that gave the Jets the ball at the 2.\n\nNew York finished with 382 yards after getting 233 combined in the last two games with Luke Falk at quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable for us to give up that many points,\u201d Cowboys linebacker Jaylon Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an elite defense.\u201d\n\nPrescott was 28 of 40 for 277 yards, and Elliott finished with 105 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries. While the final numbers look good - 398 total yards and 26 first downs - it took a while for the Cowboys to get going. They had only 162 yards in the first half with just six first downs while getting two field goals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting ourselves behind,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our defense in a tough spot. We\u2019re not playing complementary football. It\u2019s simple as that. We\u2019ve got to start faster. We\u2019ve got to get points. We\u2019ve got to get touchdowns and allow our defense to play from up.\n\n\u201cAs long we have these slow starts, we\u2019re going to struggle.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There's no panic in the Dallas Cowboys just yet.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/cowboys_jets_football_65039_c0-149-3582-2238_s1200x700.jpg?bb12e3eebd949a00403fe7faeade5bb5c6ea2117", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
