The two battled in a tightly contested back and forth fight, which resulted in a split decision win for \u201cThe Last Style Bender.\u201d\n\nVettori (13-3-1 MMA, 3-2-1 UFC) believes he\u2019s a completely different fighter now. Since the loss to Adesanya, he\u2019s only fought once due to a USADA suspension, but put on arguably his best performance in his last outing, when he defeated Cezar Ferreira in July.\n\n\u201cI improved a lot,\u201d Vettori said during Tuesday\u2019s Dominance MMA media day. \u201cAnd the problem that I gave him a year and a half ago, and comparing to what I was a year and a half ago, I think in the next time that I\u2019ll meet him, won\u2019t be no doubt.\u201d\n\nAdesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC) on the other hand, had a meteoric rise since defeating Vettori, picking up five straight wins, and capturing the middleweight title with a remarkable performance over Robert Whittaker at UFC 243.\n\nBut Vettori truly believes his fight with Adesanya was a turning point which proved that he can compete with the division\u2019s elite.\n\n\u201cI knew from before, I mean I think I know him pretty well,\u201d Vettori said. \u201cI meet him in the cage means more than actually hearing whatever he says and whatever he does, and not just the fight, right after the fight, I feel I see his true colors and yeah my fight with him, what\u2019s crazy is that it was almost a year and a half ago, and the last year and a half, I\u2019ve improved so much, it\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s improved too but I really feel like I found a stepping stone in my career.\u201d\n\nHowever, Vettori is focused on the task at hand. He takes on Andrew Sanchez this Saturday at UFC on ESPN+ 19 in Tampa, but can\u2019t wait to cross paths with Adesanya again.\n\n\u201cBut I mean it\u2019s past and I\u2019m looking to the present now,\u201d Vettori said. \u201cI have a fight in less than a week, so I\u2019m just going to keep doing my thing and I know deep inside I can be the world champ, so I just have to keep going on this path and time will show. I\u2019m not really focused on this but I knew before that I can have an impact on this division for sure and from the first day that I\u2019m here, for this, but he did good. He\u2019s the champ right now, and I can\u2019t wait to meet him again.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Vettori, click on the video linked above.", "description": "Marvin Vettori believes he's a different fighter from the first time he fought Israel Adesanya, and can't wait to fight him again.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/marvin-vettori-dominance-media-day.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
