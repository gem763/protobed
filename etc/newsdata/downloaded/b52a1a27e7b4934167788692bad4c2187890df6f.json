LOUIS (AP) - Grassroots organizations are working across Missouri to persuade gun-related business owners to join efforts to limit access to guns or encourage safe storage for potentially suicidal customers.\n\nOne of the initiatives, Safer Homes Collaborative, sends part-time field coordinators to hundreds of gun shops, pawn shops and firearms training facilities across the state. The coordinators, who are gun owners themselves, ask the retailers to display educational materials and provide temporary storage of firearms. The retailers also are asked to complete a one-hour training to identify potentially suicidal customers and delay the sale of a gun or encourage safe storage.\n\nWith gun safety a hot button political issue across the country, coordinators say some people are suspicious of their work, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported .\n\n\u201cThe perception is that this is gun control,\u201d said Katie Ellison, the collaborative\u2019s director. \u201cAnother challenge falls under the fear and stigma categories. They say, \u2018I\u2019m here to sell a firearm, I\u2019m not a mental health professional. This is not my expertise.\u2019\u201d\n\nJoe Gilbert, who manages a gun shop in Columbia, was skeptical when he was approached about the Safer Homes Collaborative last winter. The coordinator who visited his store, Kurt Dudenhoeffer, asked Gilbert to post educational material containing 10 rules of safe gun handling written by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. But the group adds an important 11th suggestion: Consider temporarily storing a weapon somewhere outside the home if someone living there may be suicidal.\n\nGilbert said he joined the effort after his research found the Safer Homes Collaborative didn\u2019t lobby, legislate or protest. Eventually he became a board member, took the training and is now a trainer to help others spot potentially suicidal customers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about reducing access to lethal means when a person is at risk,\u201d Gilbert said, \u201cand that is something I agreed with wholeheartedly.\u201d\n\nSimilar programs exist across the state, including a collaboration between the Eastern Missouri Chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the NSSF, a trade association. The two groups have developed educational materials and a website to help retailers understand suicide and encourage firearms storage options.\n\nResearch shows many people think about suicide for a long time but act impulsively, and the likelihood they will kill themselves increases dramatically if they have access to weapons during weak moments.\n\nResearch indicates that having a gun in the home when someone is contemplating suicide is one of the biggest risk factors for a fatality, said Dr. Bart Andrews with Behavioral Health Response, which provides mental health crisis services in the St. Louis region. \u201cThe data is overwhelming. Guns don\u2019t make people suicidal, but people who are suicidal who have access to firearms are a lot more likely to end up dead than people who are suicidal who don\u2019t have access to firearms.\u201d\n\nMissouri has the 13th highest suicide rate in the nation and suicides have increased by 53.5% in the last decade, according to state data released last month. More than a dozen studies show that access to firearms triples one\u2019s risk of death by suicide, not just for the gun owner but for everyone in the household.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Grassroots organizations are working across Missouri to persuade gun-related business owners to join efforts to limit access to guns or encourage safe storage for potentially suicidal customers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
