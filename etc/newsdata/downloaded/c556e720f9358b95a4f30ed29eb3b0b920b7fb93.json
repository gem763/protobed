They need to remove him, and they need to do so within days.\n\nThe identity of the \u201chim\u201d speaks, as he refuses to, for itself. He wouldn\u2019t apologise to Jo Cox\u2019s friends for deriding their natural fears that he will incite another slogan-spouting maniac to murder. He blamed it all on a misunderstanding. Which sounded startlingly like humbug.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t deny that, should his rhetoric stir violence (as Amber Rudd warned), he would make the Civil Contingencies Act his ally in the crusade for no deal.\n\nNor did he deny it when Andrew Marr asked if he has lobbied any other EU leaders, specifically the Magyar demi dictator Viktor Orban, to veto an extension. He tacitly acknowledged the possibility of colluding with a foreign power to crash us out on Halloween.\n\nJust about all he would say, apart from the gibberish about the 40 new hospitals, was, repeatedly, \u201csurrender bill\u201d. On the News of the World reader paedophile/paediatrician confusion template, it may not be long before some boneheaded thug mistakenly directs their anger at a British Asian person with a certain forename. A Newham Council resourcing manager, I see on Linkedin, is called Surinder Bal. Mr Bal, I beg you to consider temporary deed poll until this fever has broken.\n\nWe all know what Boris Johnson\u2019s plan is. Life is too short to read (let alone write) another screechy whine about the Bannon-Cummings anarcho-nutter divide-and-rule-by-inflaming-hatred playbook.\n\nIt is what it is \u2013 and what it is, apart from tooth enamel-meltingly repulsive, is a plan with a serious chance of succeeding here as three years ago in the US.\n\nTo get his general election, Johnson is desperate to goad an opposition party to call the confidence vote that might well facilitate it. The tactic is so blatant, it might as well be stamped \u201cHazTrap!\u201d.\n\nYet with Johnson adamant about not asking for to request an extension, the only reliable way to rule out no deal is to end his tenure. And the only relatively reliable way to do that is via the vote of no confidence he craves.\n\nIf he calculates that the odds are stacked against being replaced via this method, he\u2019s probably right. Even if the confidence vote floated by the SNP for this week were won, it\u2019s unlikely a Commons majority would settle on an alternative PM within the 14 days allotted by statute before an election becomes mandatory.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Ousting Johnson would cause an eruption of rage \u2013 some genuine; more of it synthesised by propaganda sheets posing as newspapers \u2013 to make last week\u2019s exchanges in the House sound like JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis debating an obtuse point of literary criticism over pints of bitter with diazepam chasers in an Oxford pub.\n\nBut we could live with that. If required, the Civil Contingencies Act is designed to deal with violent uprisings. We\u2019d survive.\n\nSo if the central difficulty is finding an individual on whom all the opponents of no deal can agree, the suggestion is this: don\u2019t bother. Don\u2019t even try. Abandon on the alternative PM thing.\n\nForget inveigling Jo Swinson to renege on never enabling a Jeremy Corbyn premiership even for a few weeks. Leave Margaret Beckett to her caravan. Free Harriet Harman to dream her dreams of the speaker\u2019s chair.\n\nDispense, for a while, with the post of prime minister \u2013 an unprecedented move for an age without precedent, and not necessarily an unpopular one, given the form of the incumbent and his two immediate predecessors \u2013 and replace it with a ruling council of equals.\n\nThis would have to include Corbyn, Swinson and an apostate Tory, preferably Ken Clarke. It would probably want to be a council of five to include the Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid.\n\nMembers of the Council of National Unity, or whatever it chose to call itself, could draw lots for the honour of formally requesting the extension from the EU, and alternate at PMQs. They should limit their existence to the three or four months needed for a second referendum.\n\nThey should guarantee that the day after, regardless of the result, they would invite Johnson, or his successor as leader of the opposition, to join them in voting for a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.\n\nIt feels a bit late for anyone to adopt Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cWhen they go low, we go high\u201d. No one in this game is soaring above the carnage.\n\nBut a unity ruling council would send this message when it is needed most.\n\nWhen he squeezes the thigh of civil unrest, we cross our legs against his rabble-rousing. When he abuses the memory of a dead woman to widen division, we honour it by sticking together. When he tries to shut down debate, we give a voice to everyone who wants to be heard.\n\nWhen he limits his vocal output to focus group-tested wolf whistles, we will speak in his place.
