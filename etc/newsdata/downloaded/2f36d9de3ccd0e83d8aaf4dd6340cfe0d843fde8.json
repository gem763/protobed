This year\u2019s addition, the $160 Gingerbread House, looks like the perfect standalone piece for brick fans with limited room.\n\nWhereas sets like 2017\u2019s awesome Winter Village train station work best as part of a larger build, I see the new Gingerbread House as a lovely solo decoration for a fireplace mantle or dining room table centrepiece. It\u2019s 1,477 pieces of self-contained holiday cheer, hitting store shelves on October 1, and it\u2019s only making me mildly hungry.\n\nI love building houses out of gingerbread. Piping frosting, dotting the roof with gumdrops, making signposts and lighting fixtures out of candy canes. The problem is I also love eating gingerbread. When I finish building a real gingerbread house, demolition begins almost immediately. I can see myself resisting eating the Lego Gingerbread House for at least a week. Maybe a week and a half.\n\nLook at the little people. Couldn\u2019t you just eat them up? If not, imagine these magical baked creatures somehow managed to afford a lavish household in this economy. Just look at the interior. It\u2019s so lavish.\n\nIt\u2019s got a lovely chair, a kitchenette. I\u2019d prefer a full kitchen, but when you are food maybe food isn\u2019t as important. And look upstairs. They\u2019ve got a large bed they obviously share. There\u2019s a bathtub\u2014and a toilet, which raises questions I\u2019d rather not answer. And is that a bassinet? Wait a minute here. Computer, zoom in on Mrs. Gingerbread.\n\nOh my god, her head is strawberry-filled. Also, it looks like she has given birth to a piece of flatbread. Gingerbread sex confirmed. Now I definitely want to eat them.\n\nFortunately for everyone, young children probably won\u2019t notice the wealth of disturbing biological evidence scattered about the Lego Gingerbread House set. They\u2019ll just gather around, all rosy-cheeked and enchanted, while the adults make humping motions to each other behind their backs.\n\nHappy holidays, eventually.", "description": "Every year around this time, Lego unveils the latest expansion to its ever-growing 'Winter Village' line of sets and I bemoan not having a massive basement to deck out in blocky holiday cheer.
