Cove / Splash News)\n\n(Image: charlesdrury1/Instagram)\n\n\"I'm not sure how many were done after that. I woke up in the morning and the party was still going on for her.\"\n\nHe also alleges she went for four days without sleeping after one supposed binge, and said the \"all over the place\" star sometimes disappears for days at a time.\n\nA spokesperson for Katie has denied she is using drugs on a regular basis.\n\n\"There is no truth in the allegation that she is taking drugs every day and has made significant steps to being drug free - there have been lapses in the past but they are just that, not a regular event. Katie is still in recovery and making progress,\" the rep said.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nIt's a sad state of affairs for someone who was held up as an empowering icon - a woman who turned her searing honesty into a multi-million pound industry.\n\nFamed for her work ethic and shrewd business moves, even as little as four years ago, everything she touched turned to gold.\n\nSo what's going on with the star?\n\nIt's fair to say Katie hasn't had an easy life. Her son Harvey, 17, was born partially blind, autistic and with the genetic disorder Prader-Willi syndrome meaning he requires around the clock care.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHer mum Amy is currently battling an incurable lung disease and her first husband Peter Andre - who she admits was the 'love of her life' - is happily ensconced with his younger wife Emily and their two children while she struggles to find love.\n\nBut even before she was famous, Katie's life was marred by trauma when she was sexually abused.\n\nShe was just six years old when she was attacked by \"some weirdo\" in a park.\n\nThe mother-of-five was with a friend when the paedophile exposed himself and molested them before a group of older children scared him off.\n\nBreaking down in a 2009 interview with Piers Morgan's Life Stories, Katie insisted, \"It\u2019s never affected me. But obviously it must have done, for me to just feel like that.\"\n\nDesperate to keep her emotions under control, she added, \"You just learn to get on with things, don\u2019t you?\"\n\nHowever, she admitted the ordeal influenced her decision to ditch nursing in favour of glamour modelling and \"led to me dressing provocatively.\"\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n\"You could be all sexy,\" she told Loose Women. \"Being a glamour model is a trade for men, so it was like, you can look at me but you can't touch me.\"\n\nShe was also photographed by a convicted paedophile as a teenager and said she was raped by a \"famous celebrity\" in a magazine column.\n\n\"A famous celebrity raped me and [ex-husband] Peter [Andre] knows who it was,\" she told OK! magazine.\n\n(Image: Daniel Deme / WENN)\n\n\"It was years ago before I was with Pete, and my friends and family knew about it at the time.\"\n\nKatie has always refused to name her attacker but in 2017 told This Morning's Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes that he's still on TV.\n\n\"I've been raped by a celebrity, you would know who the person is,\" she said.\n\n\"There\u2019s a reason why I can\u2019t say it. When you\u2019ve seen that person on telly, you so want to say.\"", "description": "Katie Price previously revealed that she turned to glamour modelling after being molested as a child", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Brett D.
