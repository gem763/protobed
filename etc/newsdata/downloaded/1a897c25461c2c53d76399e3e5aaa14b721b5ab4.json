F--- everything! And there ain\u2019t nothing great about Britain,\" Slowthai later told the audience.\n\nBORIS JOHNSON COMPARES BRITAIN TO THE INCREDIBLE HULK AMIDST BREXIT BATTLE\n\nSlowthai later released a statement doubling down on his politically charged performance.\n\n\"Last night I held a mirror up to this country and some people don\u2019t like its reflection,\" the rapper began. \"Yet this is exactly where we\u2019re being taken, cut off and at all costs. The people in power who are trying to isolate and divide us aren\u2019t the ones who will feel its effects the hardest. They\u2019re not the ones queuing at the food banks, not the ones navigating Universal Credit and not the ones having to deal with systematic oppression and hate crimes at the hands of privileged politicians who say what they want without fear and consequence.\"\n\nWARNING: THIS VIDEO CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE\n\n\"We as a people are not being looked after and our best interests are not being served by those in government \u2013 this is their job and they\u2019re not doing it well enough. This \u2018act\u2019 was a metaphor for what this government is doing to our country, except what I did was present it in plain sight.\"\n\nHe added: \"No Boris Johnsons were hurt in the making of this Slowthai performance. I don\u2019t condone violence in any form.\"\n\nJohnson has become the face of the \"Brexit\" movement ever since he took office in July, vowing to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 with or without a deal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe incident at the awards has stirred comparisons to the controversial 2017 photoshoot by American comic Kathy Griffin, who held a similar prop facsimile of President Trump's severed head.\n\nGriffin faced swift backlash, including lost endorsements and an end to her yearly hosting gig for CNN's New Year's Eve broadcast. She has since made efforts to salvage her career by launching a comedy tour and releasing a documentary about the experience.", "description": "A British rapper is facing backlash over holding an artificial\u00a0severed head of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at an award show on Thursday.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
