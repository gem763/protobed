That an officer faced charges to begin with in such a case is unusual, and a conviction is even rarer.\n\nAD\n\nBut the jury that decided Guyger\u2019s fate was perhaps most notable because it was diverse. The 12 jury members, plus four alternates, included seven black members, five nonblack people of color and four white members; 12 members of the entire pool were women, and the other four were men. A 2015 report published by the American Bar Association titled \u201cLack of Jury Diversity: A National Problem with Individual Consequences,\u201d demonstrated that across the country, nonwhites are consistently underrepresented on juries.\n\nAD\n\n\u2018I shot an innocent man,\u2019 says former officer on trial for murder\n\nThe diversity of the Guyger jury has renewed discussion about the intersection of race, representation, bias and fairness in the criminal justice system. Legal experts who spoke to The Washington Post agreed that the racial makeup of a jury is an undeniably important factor in criminal cases; at the same time, they cautioned against drawing sweeping conclusions about how racially diverse juries will decide in cases where a police officer is on trial.\n\n\u201cA prosecutor would be mistaken or ill-advised to believe that, say, black jurors will be more punitive on a white cop,\u201d Jennifer Laurin, a professor specializing in civil rights and criminal procedure at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, told The Post.\n\nLaurin pushes back on the conclusion that jury diversity was the defining factor in Guyger\u2019s case \u2014 and discourages people from assuming that in future cases, the prosecution\u2019s odds of victory will be higher with a more diverse jury.\n\nA black female juror and a white male juror who spoke to \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Friday did not mention race in their discussion of the jury\u2019s deliberations. They handed Guyger a 10-year sentence, five years above the minimum guideline. The jurors said their decision was ultimately influenced by what they believed Jean himself would have wanted, Guyger\u2019s remorse on the witness stand, and the fact Guyger did not set out to kill Jean, but made fatal decisions after entering his home by mistake.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLife experience colors outlook\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, who represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown and Tamir Rice and is now representing the Jean family, sees jury diversity as an unequivocal factor.\n\n\u201cDoes it matter? Absolutely. It has a tremendous impact,\u201d Crump told The Post the day after Guyger\u2019s sentence. \u201cIn many cases, the case is won and lost in jury selection.\u201d\n\nCrump, who is black, said racial or ethnic identity is a common life experience that can transmit a powerful, if unconscious, relatability. Crump suspects black jurors in Guyger\u2019s case \u201cdidn\u2019t have to hear a word about Jean singing in his church choir or going to college\u201d to relate to and humanize the victim.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou have to get diversity [on juries], because you have to get people who understand \u2018this could be my child, my niece, my nephew,\u2019 \u201d Crump said. \u201cDoing the same thing and expecting different results is the definition of insanity, and for the past 400 years, black and brown people haven\u2019t gotten the consideration of equal justice under the law.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLaurin agreed that \u201cit\u2019s absolutely plausible\u201d the individual experiences of the jurors\u2019 will affect their evaluation of the credibility of police or what constitutes \u201creasonable\u201d when it comes to matters such as officer use-of-force or officers\u2019 claims that they were in danger.\n\n\u201cIn a world where white jurors and jurors of color are statistically likely to have had different life experiences with police and with racism, it is reasonable to think that a more diverse pool of jurors might come at those issues in a different way,\u201d Laurin said.\n\nAD\n\nAmber Guyger was hugged by her victim\u2019s brother and a judge, igniting a debate about forgiveness and race\n\nRonald Wright, whose research focuses on criminal procedure and prosecution at Wake Forest Law School, echoes Laurin\u2019s caution about drawing overly broad conclusions tied to race.\n\nThere\u2019s ample data from both decades of cases and experimental studies on how the racial makeup of juries affects criminal cases, but there\u2019s virtually no data on criminal cases where a police officer is accused of killing a civilian \u2014 a potent variable \u2014 because prosecutions of police officers are so rare and are relatively recent, Wright said. Since 2005, only 35 officers have been convicted of a crime related to an on-duty fatal shooting, according to a report by NBC News.\n\nAD\n\nMixed juries behave differently\n\nIn cases where an officer is not the defendant, Wright said some patterns related to the racial makeup of the jury hold true: For every white male juror, \u201cyou add measurably to the probability that the jury would convict, and it\u2019s a stronger tendency if the defendant is an African American male.\u201d The reverse is true when more black men are on the jury; they convict less frequently. The data was inconclusive on white and nonwhite women.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe do know juries of a single race behave differently if they have at least one nonwhite juror,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt gets markedly stronger if there\u2019s two; it gets much more noticeable with two because what would otherwise be a lone nonwhite juror is less isolated. If there are at least two [nonwhite jurors], you\u2019re more likely to have a hung jury, or maybe conviction on a lesser charge.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWright said there\u2019s not much data on the reverse, of how majority nonwhite juries behave with the addition of one or two white jurors since nonwhites are rarely the majority in juries because of factors such as the rate of jury summons that come back as \u201cundeliverable\u201d being higher for nonwhite residents, and that prosecutors are more likely to strike black and nonblack people of color from prospective jury pools.\n\n\u2018Not racist but \u2026\u2019: Amber Guyger sent offensive texts\n\nLaurin and Wright both agree that given the vastly different life experiences and police interactions nonwhites have compared with whites, a diverse jury will certainly bring different perspectives than an all or majority white one, but Lauren said the Guyger case provides a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d for drawing blunt conclusions about how diverse juries behave: The jury could have convicted Guyger of manslaughter, but found her guilty of the more severe murder charge. At the same time, given a range of sentencing Guyger to between five and 99 years, they opted for 10.\n\nAD\n\nWright said if more officers are charged with murder, he would look at the racial makeup of juries, but also the reputation of police in a particular community, which adds yet another variable into the equation.\n\nAD\n\nThe bottom line for Laurin is that in officer-involved cases, and especially in the Guyger case, while a jury\u2019s racial makeup can make a difference, it\u2019s hard to isolate it as the deciding factor \u2014 particularly when the idea of fairness is constantly being balanced and rebalanced in each new case.\n\n\u201cDo we think a jury is fair when it is broadly and accurately representative of the community? Or do we think a jury is fair when the defendant has the best odds of gaining its sympathy?\u201d Laurin said. \u201cThose are two very different concepts of what we think a jury is supposed to do.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nInside the jury room, an agonizing deliberation to sentence Amber Guyger\n\nForever 21 is filing for bankruptcy.
