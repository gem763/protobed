More and more supermarkets are replacing their news racks with candy, toys and other non-newsy items.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a few grocery and retail stores move to eliminate onsite newspaper distribution,\u201d said David Chavern, President & CEO of the News Media Alliance. \u201cWhile news consumers are obviously moving to online sources, we should all be aware that these moves really hit small and alternative newspapers the hardest. There are thousands of communities where the best source of information is still a free weekly paper and eliminating access doesn\u2019t help anyone.\u201d\n\nChavern also said that \u201cmost of the outreach has been directly between publishers and retailers and that \u201cwe understand that there are new arrangements for onsite access to digital additions of news products. But that doesn\u2019t do much for publishers who have a long history of grocery store distribution.\u201d\n\nThat has been especially true at a place like Kroger - America\u2019s largest supermarket chain by revenue \u2013 which decided to no longer carry free newspapers and magazines as of October 15, ending an arrangement they had with local outlets for the past 20 years.\n\nThe local publishers were paying a distributor, DistribuTech, for space in the Krogers stores, and they, understandably, are not happy.\n\n\"There are thousands of communities where the best source of information is still a free weekly paper and eliminating access doesn\u2019t help anyone\u201d - David Chavern, President & CEO of the News Media Alliance\n\nOne paper that is fighting back is City Pulse, a free weekly newspaper in Lansing, Michigan. People in that town relied on it for news about artists, new restaurants, and most importantly, what\u2019s going on in the city hall.\n\nBerl Schwartz is the Pulse\u2019s publisher, and he is leading the charge with a petition against Kroger's. Just before Labor Day this year, Schwartz, a veteran journalist who founded the alt-weekly nearly two decades ago, was trying to get one of the paper\u2019s racks replaced at one of the chain\u2019s supermarkets, and it had disappeared without explanation. That\u2019s when he was told that City Pulse would no longer be carried at the grocery chain\u2019s four area locations.\n\nSchwartz posted a letter on City Pulse\u2019s website on October 3 updating his readers on his efforts: \u201cThank you for your outpouring of support for City Pulse in the face of a misguided and inconsistent decision by the Kroger Co. to ban free publications from its stores nationwide. Nearly 1,200 of you have signed a petition asking Kroger to reconsider; many of you have also called or written Kroger. Your efforts are deeply appreciated \u2014 and important. I wish I could report that Kroger is reconsidering. But Kroger has given no indication of that yet. Therefore, we hope readers will continue to voice their dissatisfaction.\u201d\n\nThe letter from Schwartz included statistics that back up what he called Kroger\u2019s \u201cmisguided and inconsistent decision.\u201d Over 3,100 people picked up a copy of City Pulse this year, a big increase over the 1,100 in 2012. In Cincinnati, which Kroger\u2019s home city, around 8,400 people a week were getting their local free newspaper, CityBeat, at the supermarket. In Colorado Springs, Colorado, 4,000 a week pick up the paper at Kroger. The Wichita (Kansas) Eagle reported that 12,000 a month pick up that free publication at Krogers in that area.\n\nSchwartz also noted that Kroger's has found room for some papers, noting, \u201cin this market, other free publications associated with Gannett, which owns the Lansing State Journal, remain available in Kroger stores. Perhaps Kroger does not want to disturb its arrangements with Gannett and other paid newspapers, which may be more lucrative than what City Pulse and other free publications have been paying for space.\u201d\n\nThe Association of Alternative News Media \u2013 whose membership includes the Austin Chronicle and Pittsburgh City Paper - also launched a campaign last month to try to get Krogers to keep free publications like its member alt-weeklies in stores, and individual news outlets are asking their readers to call Krogers and complain.\n\nKroger's blamed the move on the changing technology and audience. \"We are removing the publication racks from our stores because more publications continue to shift to digital formats, resulting in less customers using the products,\" Teresa Dickerson, corporate affairs manager of Kroger's Delta Division, told The Memphis Business Journal.\n\nThe strength of hyper-local papers is in stark contrast to the decline in bigger papers\u2019 circulation, especially single-copy sales from newspaper boxes (remember those?), newsstands, and retailers such as supermarkets.\n\nThe Sunday Des Moines Register sold around 59,000 single copies in 2011, and by 2014, that had fallen to 28,000. As of the second quarter of 2019, it is down to just 13,000 copies. This a much speedier decline than the Register\u2019s print subscription and home-delivery numbers.\n\nThe Washington Post is experiencing a sort of renaissance, as political tensions in the nation's capital hasn\u2019t made the prize-winning paper this relevant since the days of Richard Nixon presidency, but it\u2019s hard to tell by its store sales. In 2011, it sold an average of 56,000 daily (non-Sunday) single copies; three years later, it was 30,000, and currently, it\u2019s 12,000. The decline in sales of Sunday papers isn\u2019t much better, from 127,000 eight years ago to 75,000 in 2014 and 35,000 today.\n\nBut the news changes and it seems unlikely that the retail fate of publications will see good news moving forward as technology marches on.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Newspapers are vanishing from stores, but the publishers aren't going down without a fight.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/iStock-newspapers.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
