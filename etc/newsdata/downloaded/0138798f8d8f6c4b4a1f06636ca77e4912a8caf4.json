We always say, \u2018We may come suddenly one night.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf successful, the incursion could significantly expand a Turkish zone of influence already established in northern Syria, damaging prospects for the emergence of a Kurdish-run enclave that Ankara views as a threat to its security. It could also provide a space to vacate hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in Turkey that are increasingly proving a political burden on Mr Erdogan\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party.\n\nBut the risks for Turkey are also many. From the Saudi intervention in Yemen, to the Iranian role in Iraq, to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt\u2019s backing for a warlord in Libya, the region is dotted with open-ended and expensive entanglements that end up backfiring.\n\nTurkey is already fighting a guerilla war against separatist Kurds of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in its own southeast provinces. Expanding the ground war into Syria against the PKK\u2019s allies risks sparking a separate insurgency. The Syrian Democratic Forces, the collection of Kurdish-led armed groups partnered with the US in its fight against ISIS, said it was \u201cdetermined to defend our land at all costs\u201d against Turkey.\n\nSyrian Kurdish women carry banners as they demonstrate against Turkish threats to launch a military operation on their region, in the town of Al-Qahtaniyah, in northeastern Syrian (AFP via Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cWhat makes Turkey think they\u2019re not going to get caught in northern Syria fighting a protracted campaign?\u201d said Steven Cook, a Turkey and Middle East specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn addition, an incursion into northern Syria could incur the wrath of Isis remnants, and puts them potentially in charge of thousands of jihadis now being held in prisons or at a displaced persons camp near the desert village of al-Hol.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey alone finds that there\u2019s a resurgent Isis that\u2019s too big to handle it could find itself in trouble,\u201d said Matthew Bryza, a former US diplomat and White House official now a fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\nThe incursion also risks incurring the ire of the Syrian regime, and its allied Russian and Iranian backers. Moscow, Ankara, and Tehran are jointly negotiating Syria\u2019s future, but remain wary of each other. While Russia and Iran support the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Turkey has long demanded he step down or share power with opposition groups it hosts.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s political establishment appeared firmly behind a potentially risky military intervention into northern Syria after receiving the approval of the White House and a commitment to withdraw US troops from the Kurdish-run enclave.Turkish troops and military vehicles were massed Monday along the Syrian", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NgaMDMEcwlsd8s2O0NVnkw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9dae9a0989792552df703a27d7361930", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
