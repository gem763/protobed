James\u2019 signature sneaker line is one of Nike\u2019s most prominent offerings. James\u2019 standing in China could also impact the future efforts of his media production company, SpringHill Entertainment. The firm is producing \u201cSpace Jam 2,\u201d the highly anticipated sequel to NBA legend Michael Jordan\u2019s original film, which will seek a massive return from Chinese audiences.\n\nWhile it may seem incredible that an athlete would have such a strong financial interest in a country, the reality of the situation becomes more clear when viewing it through the prism of Nike itself. According to Fox Business, \u201cNike earned more than $6 billion in revenue from China during its 2019 fiscal year.\u201d\n\nSuch a figure might not only explain James\u2019 harsh criticism of Daryl Morey, it may also explain the deafening silence of fellow social justice warrior and supposed human rights advocate Colin Kaepernick. The former 49er and noted anthem protester has an extremely lucrative deal with Nike as the face of the company\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d campaign, and has maintained complete silence on the NBA-China rift.\n\nNike has business partnerships with hundreds of athletes around the world. The company\u2019s monster sales in China have essentially resulted in a gag order on scores of high-profile athletes, many of whom are normally outspoken on political and human rights issues.\n\nNike itself is in a strange and contradictory position.\n\nWhile branding itself as one of, if not the face of the social justice movement in American sports, Nike has closed several businesses in America and moved their operations overseas to China, and other places with throngs low paid workers. All the while knowing that those jobs won\u2019t bring any added freedoms or free any political prisoners, they\u2019ll only helping to buttress a ruthlessly oppressive regime.\n\nSo, not only is Nike making $6 billion a year in actual sales in China, they\u2019re actually making far more when factoring in the money they\u2019re saving by using slave labor in there.\n\nWhen Nike inaugurated Colin Kaepernick\u2019s ad campaign, the slogan read: \u201cBelieve in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.\u201d\n\nAfter looking at the company\u2019s financial dealings with China and their silence on the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s human rights abuses, it\u2019s easy to see what they really stand for.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "LeBron James spoke out stridently against Rockets GM Daryl Morey on Monday night, calling his tweet in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images_Zhong-Zhi-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
