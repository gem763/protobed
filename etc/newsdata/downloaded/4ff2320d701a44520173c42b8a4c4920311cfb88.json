Nixon\u2019s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away.\n\nMr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent: The lone Trump campaign staff member working the state was moved to Colorado before Election Day. But Mr. Trump lost Minnesota to his former rival Hillary Clinton by 1.5 percentage points, or less than 45,000 votes.\n\n\u201cWe almost won it,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a visit this year to a trucking company in a Minneapolis suburb. The difference between a victory and a loss, he said, would have been coming to the state to give \u201cone more speech.\u201d\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nThis time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency.\n\n\n\nIt is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory: In 2018, the city helped elect to the House Ilhan Omar, a Democratic woman of color who has become one of the president\u2019s favorite foils.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s rally at Target Center will be bolstered by a \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d event hosted by the second lady, Karen Pence, and Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, on Wednesday in St. Paul. Vice President Mike Pence will hold his own round table on Thursday in nearby Lakeville.\n\nMeanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign\u2019s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100. And the campaign and the Republican National Committee are outspending Democrats by about four to one on digital advertising, according to campaign officials and local Democratic Party officials.\n\n\u201cIt is a full-on major effort state campaign,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. \u201cAnd we will have the resources behind it to make it count.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Democrats said it felt as if their state was a true battleground for the first time in decades.\n\n\u201cOver the last 25 years, I\u2019ve never seen an investment as robust and deep this early by a Republican presidential candidate,\u201d said Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Mr. Martin said it was clear to him that \u201cTrump and the Republicans believe they can win and are doing everything to make it so.\u201d\n\nFew states in the Midwest exemplify Mr. Trump\u2019s strengths, such as popularity in rural areas, as well as his weaknesses, such as his shaky standing in suburban areas, the way Minnesota does. Which group turns out in bigger numbers could determine who wins the state on Election Day.\n\nIf Mr. Trump succeeds in flipping Minnesota\u2019s 10 electoral votes, it will probably mean that he has secured himself another four years in the White House. No Democratic candidate can carve a path to victory without Minnesota, and Trump officials are eager to put Democrats on defense there. One campaign official compared the dynamic to Republicans having to spend resources to defend a Republican stronghold like Indiana.\n\n\u00a9 Tom Brenner for The New York Times Mr. Trump during a rally last year in Rochester, Minn.\n\nBut the changing makeup of the state has made Minnesota something of a microcosm for the Trump campaign\u2019s challenge as it builds him a solid infrastructure nationwide: This time isn\u2019t last time.\n\n\u201cThis election is much more a referendum on him and his performance as president,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. \u201cHe has managed to turn a lot of voters off through his conduct and performance. It\u2019s hard to overcome that with field organizing.\u201d\n\nMr. Garin noted that the suburban vote in Minnesota was much more significant than in neighboring Wisconsin, and Mr. Trump was consistently polling poorly in suburbs. \u201cA variety of factors have taken it from being a closely contested state to much more of a slingshot for Trump,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cThe kind of antics at his rallies that occur are unlikely to help him in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nTo win Minnesota, Mr. Trump would have to gain about 45,000 more votes than he did in 2016, while keeping Democratic turnout roughly the same as it was last cycle. A poll commissioned before his visit Thursday by Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a group aligned with Democrats, showed that 49 percent of respondents favored an impeachment inquiry, compared with 44 percent who believed it was a bad idea.\n\nThe poll, conducted by Public Policy Polling, also found that 52 percent of respondents would vote for an unnamed Democratic opponent if the election were held today, compared with 42 percent who said they would vote for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cWe had record turnout for a midterm election in 2018,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cThat was fueled in urban cores and suburbs. He\u2019s going to have to do better than he did in the suburbs and exurbs, and we haven\u2019t seen that happening.\u201d\n\nFor their part, Trump campaign officials are more focused on the Iron Range, the mining communities in the northern part of the state. In 2016, for instance, Mr. Trump won the states\u2019 Eighth District in the north by 16 points. President Barack Obama won it by six points in 2012. That is where Trump campaign officials see an urban-rural divide that is trending in their direction, while the election of progressive lawmakers like Ms. Omar has pushed voters further in the direction of Democrats in urban areas.\n\nIron Rangers in northern Minnesota have been fleeing the Democratic Party because of promises to end the fossil fuel industry, among others, according to local officials, who point to Representative Collin C. Peterson, a Democrat, as an example of the state\u2019s changing politics. Mr. Peterson, who represents Minnesota\u2019s Seventh District, won his race in 2012 by 26 points. In 2018, he eked out a victory with a much slimmer 4-point margin. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the Seventh District by 31.5 points.\n\nBut the rural regions in the state have also seen a loss of population, while the suburbs, where Mr. Trump has done little to expand his appeal with voters, have grown.\n\nThis week, Mr. Trump tried to capitalize on that divide by leaning into a fight with Jacob Frey, the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, who wanted to charge the campaign about half-a-million dollars for the extra security required to host the presidential visit. Framing Mr. Trump as a victim, his campaign accused the mayor of trying to shut down the rally.\n\nIn a statement, the campaign called Mr. Frey a \u201cradical leftist mayor\u201d who was \u201cabusing the power of his office and attempting to extort President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign by conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally.\u201d\n\nThe campaign ultimately settled the dispute without paying the additional funds. It was not clear whether the city or the arena would be footing the bill instead. But some Democrats said they worried Mr. Frey had inflamed a real divide in the state, emboldening people to go see Mr. Trump after a Democratic mayor appeared to try to tell them they could not.\n\nThe heated back-and-forth hinted at the aggrieved tone Mr. Trump plans to strike at the rally Thursday night. \u201cThe lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday on Twitter.", "description": "A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M.
