Gains for the euro were capped, since the German economy is still likely to slip into recession as the U.S.-China trade conflict and Brexit bite, the Ifo economic institute said.\n\nThat followed Monday\u2019s euro zone composite flash Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) on Monday, which sank to 50.4 in September from 51.9 in August, lower than all forecasts in a Reuters poll, which had predicted a reading of 51.9.\n\n\u201cThe (European) data was quite negative but I think the euro has stabilized for now and we see it heading up to $1.12 versus the dollar in the coming months,\u201d said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole in London.\n\nThe euro was up 0.11% at $1.1003.\n\nThe dollar found little support from safe-haven flows as concern about trade talks between Washington and Beijing eased after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for talks in early October.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cIt feels like we are having a risk-on day today,\u201d said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. \u201cA lot of this is really stemming from the expectation of trade negotiations come October.\u201d\n\nSterling gained after the UK Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was unlawful, a decision seen as making less likely Britain would leave the European Union without a transition agreement.\n\nThe pound was up 0.36% against the dollar.", "description": "The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on Tuesday after data showed in U.S. consumer confidence fell in September, raising worries about the strength of the U.S. economy.", "authors": ["Saqib Iqbal Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433382258&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1CI", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
