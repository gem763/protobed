Luckily, she\u2019s in the perfect place to do both: Paris. That\u2019s where she co-manages the $374 million Buffalo International fund by day and hosts dinner parties by night.\n\nAs she sees it, cooking and investing have many parallels: \u201cYou rely on the techniques, but you\u2019re also constantly adapting, while also being very patient,\u201d Kornitzer says.\n\nIt seems fitting that the family dinner table is also where she first learned about the stock market and the nuances of running a business. She was a teenager when her father, John Kornitzer, started Kornitzer Capital Management, the now\u2013$7 billion Mission, Kan.\u2013based advisor to the Buffalo Funds.\n\nThe international fund (ticker: BUFIX), which she manages with her cousin Bill Kornitzer, has returned an average of 7.5% a year over the past decade, better than 83% of its foreign large growth peers and well ahead of its benchmark.\n\nRead more: How a Small-Cap Fund Weeds Out the Worst Stocks\n\n\u201cI was always interested in investing, but it took me a while to realize it,\u201d says Kornitzer. She studied biology in college and was on a path to go to medical school when a detour to teach English in Chile changed everything: \u201cIt was there I had this realization that I was passionate about international business, and how globalization was changing the world.\u201d\n\nAfter Chile, Kornitzer returned to the Kansas City area to work as a junior analyst at Kornitzer Capital covering health care. She eventually got her certified-financial-analyst designation and an M.B.A. Kornitzer started working as an analyst on the international fund shortly after its 2007 launch, spending long stints in Paris. \u201cAt the time it was a lot cheaper to rent an apartment here than in London,\u201d says Kornitzer, who was named co-manager in 2009 and made her move to Paris permanent in 2013 after meeting her husband there.\n\nWith Bill Kornitzer in Kansas, the two managers can cover every time zone and consider political, economic, and social shifts from many different angles. (John, Bill, and Nicole Kornitzer are the only family members working for the firm.)\n\nThe fund\u2019s investment universe includes companies of virtually any size and market outside of the U.S. To narrow that down to roughly 80 holdings, the two Kornitzers follow a similar strategy as the other Buffalo funds. Companies must exhibit traits consistent with premier firms: strong management, growing margins, healthy balance sheets, positive cash flow, and significant competitive advantages. They also need to tie back to at least one of a couple dozen secular trends, such as increased automation, the emerging middle class, and the globalization of brands.\n\nLike planning a menu, there is some flexibility in how Kornitzer identifies her picks. Sometimes a trend inspires an investment, or she might find a company first and analyze the idea in the context of related trends. \u201cWe need to be able to answer the question of why is the company going to continue growing,\u201d says Kornitzer, who aims for companies with the potential to deliver double-digit returns annually over at least five years.\n\nIn the case of the fund\u2019s largest holding, Sartorius Stedim Biotech (DIM.France), growth is coming from the proliferation of chronic diseases and an increasing emphasis on health-care cost containment. The France-based company is benefiting from the biotech boom, but its fate doesn\u2019t depend on one drug. \u201cThey make the picks and shovels needed to manufacture biopharmaceuticals,\u201d says Kornitzer, whose fund first bought the stock in 2017 at $63 a share. It has since soared to more than $140 a share, but she says the company can achieve annual double-digit top-line growth over the next five years while improving its impressive 80% margins.\n\nAnother top holding, Tomra (TOM.Norway), is on the cutting edge when it comes to reducing food waste and collecting and sorting recycling. The Norwegian company already has an established niche making sensor-based equipment used to sort food, \u201cbut they are also developing technology that can detect bacteria and sort for freshness,\u201d Kornitzer says. Tomra also makes reverse vending machines that use automation to collect and sort recyclables\u2014a segment that accounts for half the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe fund has owned Tomra since its inception in 2007, when the stock traded around $7 a share and 16 times forward earnings. The stock might look pricey trading above $27 and at 42 times earnings, but Kornitzer says Tomra is can capture growing demand for waste-reduction technology.\n\nYounger consumers are leading the charge when it comes to reduce, reuse, and recycle, and that may be providing an additional lift for such luxury goods companies as LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (MC.France) and Kering (KER.France). \u201cSome analysts hypothesize that millennials buy luxury goods at a higher rate because of a growing interest in buying things that last,\u201d says Kornitzer. Having a large portfolio allows them to diversify against the natural ups and downs of brands.\n\nThe fund first bought Paris-based Kering\u2014whose portfolio of brands includes Balenciaga, Gucci, and Yves Saint Laurent\u2014in March 2012 when shares traded around $158, and has bought more since. The stock recently traded near $512 a share, but the conglomerate trades at a lower valuation than most of its luxury peers.\n\nNaysayers worry about the impact of protests in Hong Kong and trade tensions with China, but improving margins could buffer any slowdown in revenue growth. \u201cKering has used this period of high growth to remodel stores, and invest in their supply chains, e-commerce, and digital platforms,\u201d Kornitzer says. \u201cMany of these things can be shared among the brands.\u201d\n\nEmail: editors@barrons.com", "description": "The Buffalo International fund looks across the globe for companies that can deliver consistent growth.
