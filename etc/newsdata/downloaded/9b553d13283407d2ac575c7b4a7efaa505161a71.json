So far this year, algae has been implicated in dog deaths and illness in California, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas. In August, toxic algae overtook Lake Erie, growing to 620 square miles.\n\nThese biotoxic blooms can last anywhere from a few weeks to over a year.\n\nThis nationwide algae epidemic points to a sustained shift in the aquatic environment \u2013 one that experts say is being driven by pollution and the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cWe believe climate change is really having a huge impact on the occurrence and growth of these blooms,\u201d said Anne Schechinger, a senior analyst for the Environmental Working Group (EWG). \u201cWe know the incidence of blooms is just going to keep going up and up.\u201d\n\nA report by the EWG found toxic algae blooms have apparently grown in size and frequency multi-fold since 2010. Reports of algae outbreaks are up 22% compared to this same time last year.\n\n\u201cIt really is a national problem,\u201d said Schechinger. \u201cIt essentially affects everybody.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Susie Cagle/The Guardian\n\nWith no government agency comprehensively tracking the total incidents of algae blooms nationwide, the EWG uses news items as a proxy. Without other available data it\u2019s a decent measure, but only so long as algae blooms remain fresh. The more normal and less newsworthy recurring algae blooms become, the more difficult it may be to track them. And there\u2019s every reason to believe this is the slimy, water-tainting, beach-ruining, dog-killing new normal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Susie Cagle/The Guardian\n\nNot all algae blooms are harmful, and not all harmful algae blooms are toxic. \u201cHarmful algae bloom\u201d is a catch-all that includes a variety of photosynthesizing bacteria that can wreak havoc on both aquatic and human communities, either by depriving sealife of sunlight and oxygen, creating so-called \u201cdead zones\u201d; slopping up on panoramic shorelines and ravaging tourism economies; or producing water and airborne toxins that can kill.\n\nA partnership between the Environmental Protection Agency, Nasa, Noaa and the US Geological Survey monitors water across the country for algae blooms using satellite imagery, but most of the onerous and expensive toxin tracking is left to state agencies.\n\n\u201cIt really is up to the states to keep people safe from this, and not a lot of states are even doing any monitoring,\u201d said Schechinger. \u201cThis is going to be a wakeup call to a lot of these states that they need to be doing more.\u201d\n\nBut even where some places are testing for algae-produced toxins, there are currently no limits on how much algae-produced toxin, considered an \u201cunregulated contaminant\u201d, is allowable in drinking water under current law.\n\nDr Don Anderson, director of the US National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, described algae blooms as \u201cformidable competitors\u201d made all the more dangerous by warming water.\n\nSome research has linked exposure to cyanobacteria, more commonly known as \u201cblue-green algae\u201d, to neurological disease, including ALS. Anderson contends far more research is needed to know how humans might fare with prolonged exposure to pervasive algae toxins..\n\n\u201cI am not skeptical about the fact that these cyanobacteria produce a lot of really nasty compounds and people are being exposed to them occasionally through drinking water but also through recreation \u2013 or even just walking around a lake and breathing,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nIt is possible to treat water to remove cyanobacterial toxins, but the most obvious and cost-effective way to stop these blooms is stemming the stream of nutrient pollution: reducing runoff from cities and farms with buffer zones between agricultural land and waterways.\n\n\u201cIf we can stop these nutrients from flowing into the water, we could prevent these blooms in the first place,\u201d said Schechinger.\n\nLike monitoring, buffer zones are not required by law \u2013 and they may still not be enough to stop the spread of algae. Where legacy nutrients are stored in the watershed, algae can bloom without any new food.\n\n\u201cA lot of the damage has already been done down there in the sediments,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cIt\u2019s a daunting problem, and it\u2019s not going to be an easy one to mitigate.\u201d\n\nAnd, said Schechinger: \u201cThe season\u2019s not over yet.\u201d", "description": "Warming water and pollution are contributing to a variety of harmful bacteria that can wreak havoc on aquatic environments", "authors": ["Susie Cagle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22d870cded37dd13e3d190d73ebfbf42337b09d5/0_311_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=949e3fe65640346d1f72ead25b10f941", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
