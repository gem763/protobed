The Times quietly reworded the paragraph to say \u201cit wasn\u2019t clear\u201d if there\u2019d been any such arrangement.\n\nOf course, in the age of social media, fake news doesn\u2019t just harm the people who consume the source; journalists like Jake Tapper, who has more than 2 million followers, certainly found the arrangement a little sketchy and tweeted about it, but deleted his tweet once he found out about the edit.\n\nNYT edited a story after posting it, so i'm deleting my original tweet quoting language no longer in the story and tweeting out the new version. \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) September 28, 2019\n\nThis is why you're trusted. Most people wouldn't delete and correct. They would just bitch about The Times. \u2014 Robert Caruso (@robertcaruso) September 28, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s good that he deleted the original tweet, but now that it\u2019s gone, who knows how many people retweeted it? The New York Times managed to embarrass not only itself but Tapper as well.\n\nSeems like the NYT has been doing that quite a bit lately. \u2014 Hank (@Hankersly) September 28, 2019\n\nIt's tough isn't it, keeping up with #FakeNews? \u2014 Heather Champion (@winningatmylife) September 28, 2019\n\n24/7 job! \u2014 Claire Mahoney (@TaggertGirl) September 28, 2019\n\nYou mean you circulated a lie? \u2014 jrfromdallas (@DallasNYorker) September 28, 2019\n\nThe truth just keeps changing, doesn't it, Jake. \u2014 Laurie (@StormDanser) September 28, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s actually kinda weird that news articles that are supposed to represent the historical record can just be changed \u2014 Matt (@MatthewGalanty) September 28, 2019\n\nHow does nobody ever get fired at the @nytimes? Its like every week now they invent a \"bombshell story\" but retract it the next day. \u2014 Nadine Pearl Cole (@NpcPearl) September 28, 2019\n\nToo good to check. Journalism has become little more than gossip now. \u2014 Adso of Melk (@PalimpsestMan) September 28, 2019\n\nThere's a lesson here. Wait 24 to 48 hours on any negative stories about Trump before buying into them hook, line, and sinker. \u2014 Suzy (@scout_nj) September 28, 2019\n\nYeah, that\u2019s not gonna happen.\n\nPresenting the public with inflammatory details that are subsequently walked back isn't the sort of thing journalists offer soft do-overs for when people in other industries do it. \u2014 David Hines (@hradzka) September 28, 2019\n\nThat's not true. Haven't you seen them cover AOC? \u2014 Well Redneck (@WellRedneck) September 28, 2019\n\nAll of us trolls thank you. \u2014 Bullsh!t (@GOP_WH_News) September 28, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s right, he did say Trump had \u201can army of trolls\u201d defending him against impeachment.\n\nPro tip. Stop quoting the NYTimes . \u2014 \ud83c\udf32You Crack Me Up\ud83c\udf32 (@jxroland) September 28, 2019\n\nGetting pretty dangerous to rely on a NYT story or headline as a credible source in the first 48 hours. Journalisming takes time. https://t.co/VjiZcwOIHT \u2014 Jeremy Boreing (@JeremyDBoreing) September 28, 2019\n\nMy only news source is retractions. \u2014 This Platform is Toxic (@this_toxic) September 28, 2019\n\nIt's almost like a real journalist would confirm their facts and story first, THEN publish their piece. But maybe it's easier to just be an activist and make up a story, publish it, then delete after everyone calls it out for being fake. \u2014 Wes Ganobcik \u2122 (@ganobleberries) September 28, 2019\n\nThey need a waiting period \u2014 Fabulous Cramden (@FCramden) September 28, 2019\n\nReporter: \"Ooh!

Hummers (@PepeDFrog2) September 28, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s called propagate a lie, conveniently almost always an anti-Trump lie, allow it to marinate in the minds of the public, then release a quiet correction that few will see or care about.#EnemyOfThePeople \u2014 realitybiased (@realitybiased1) September 28, 2019\n\nThe does seem to be a reason Trump has pivoted from \u201cfake news media\u201d to \u201ccorrupt news media.\u201d\n\nRelated:", "description": "Jake Tapper deleted his tweet after it was retweeted how many thousand times?", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jake-tapper-face.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
