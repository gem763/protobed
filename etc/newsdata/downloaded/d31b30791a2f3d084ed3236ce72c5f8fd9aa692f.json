The US market has higher interchange fees and higher credit card rewards to incentivise credit card use, while the lack of a \"moat\" there may see other competitors emerge.\n\nThe view comes after prominent US academic Scott Galloway also said last week that Afterpay shares could halve; he also pointed to the likelihood of more competition, including from large credit card schemes.\n\n\"Low barriers to entry, the relative ease of replicating Afterpay's product offering and competition from other payment methods leave it vulnerable to competition,\" UBS said.\n\nUBS initiated coverage report with a $17.25 price target, 47 per cent lower than the $36.56 the stock was trading at on Tuesday. It also has a sell recommendation on Zip and a $4.80 price target. Zip was trading down 4.4 per cent lower at $5.19 on Wednesday.\n\nUsers think it's credit\n\nUBS's view that Afterpay, which operates outside consumer credit laws in Australia because it does not charge interest, could face more regulation was also based on a survey conducted by the bank's Evidence Lab of buy now pay later users. This revealed 64 per cent agreed it was is a form of credit, \"which we see as increasing the risk of regulation\".\n\nBuy now pay later customers also \"tend to be less credit-worthy than non-users\", UBS said, including being more indebted and more likely to have been rejected for a credit card than non buy now pay later customers.\n\nUBS said Afterpay's high share price infers customer growth that might not be possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUBS said it inferred a long-term US customer base of around 12 per cent of the population, \"which appears optimistic\".\n\nThe Afterpay share price infers $175 billion of merchant sales would be made over the platform by the financial year 2030, which UBS calculated would require around 47 million customers - equivalent to 18 per cent of the Australian and NZ populations, and 12.5 per cent of the US and UK adult populations - to each spend $3,800 a year on the service.\n\nThe report noted that while the outcome of AUSTRAC's investigation into anti-money laundering compliance remains uncertain, potential negative outcomes \"could include civil proceedings, fines, remedial directions, and enforceable undertakings.\"", "description": "Investment bank UBS predicts buy now, pay later juggernaut Afterpay's share price will halve within a year, initiating coverage with a sell rating and flagging looming regulatory risks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.413%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_601%2C$y_209/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6369755bd566d8437cfce10b5f69e1878a2cbbe1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
