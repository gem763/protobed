China recommends a daily intake of seven fruit and vegetable instead of the West' recommendation of five a day. Pictured: an assortment of vegetables (stock image)\n\nDO \u2013 Have seven portions of fruit or vegetables a day (China)\n\n'China recommends having at least seven portions of fruit and vegetables a day. It\u2019s no secret that fruit and veg are packed full of the good stuff, including vitamins and minerals and folic acid,' George said.\n\n'Folic acid can help reduce blood levels of homocysteine, a substance that research suggests can be a risk factor for coronary heart disease,' he added.\n\n'A combination of seven different types of fruit and vegetables is more than the global average recommendation, with Australia and the UK recommending five portions.\n\nHowever, the variety that China promotes is to ensure a healthy intake of vitamins and keep feeling full throughout the day.\n\nJapan recommends to eat fish up to three to five times a day. Pictured: a bento box comprising of sushi, salad and pork\n\nDO \u2013 Limit red meat intake (Norway)\n\nWhile eating red meat once in a while was fine, George explained it was better to eat poultry or lean meat like in Norway.\n\n'Norway\u2019s dietary guidelines limit red meat intake to two to three small portions per week - ideally choosing poultry, lean meat or lean meat products,' George explained.\n\n'Research has correlated over consumption of red meat such as bacon, beef and pork can increase a person\u2019s risk for colorectal and bowel cancer.\n\n'In addition, it\u2019s prone to increase the risk of type-2 diabetes \u2013 with research showing that people who upped their red meat intake by 3.5 servings a week had a 50% increased chance of developing it.\n\nDO \u2013 Tailor food allowances to individuals (US)\n\nGeorge explained that food guidelines were very detailed for each individual - as opposed to other countries around the world.\n\n'The US government acknowledge that calorie intake varies based on age, sex, height, weight and level of physical activity and therefore provide twelve different calorie levels and food subgroups to consume,' he said.\n\nGreece recommends two greasy meals a week, but George said to be careful, as the Mediterranean diet already contains a lot of oil. Pictured: olive oil in a jar, stock image\n\n'American guidelines recommend certain allowances for grains (including how many should be whole), oils and protein and dairy,' he added.\n\n'The twelve different calorie guides mean that appropriate recommendations can be made for individuals rather than a blanket recommendation for all.\n\nDO \u2013 Prefer natural or minimally processed foods (Brazil)\n\nGeorge said we should follow the Brazilian recommendation to eat little to no processed foods at all, as they are usually high in sugar and salt.\n\n'Many ultra-processed foods contain an alarmingly high amount of sugar, which as well as leading to weight gain can have devastating effects on metabolism,' he said.\n\n'In addition, processed foods contain more refined carbohydrates that freshly produced food. Whilst carbohydrates are essential for energy intake, carbs from whole foods are much better for the body than refined carbs, as they break down slower \u2013 releasing energy for longer and preventing spikes in blood sugar levels,' he added.\n\nDO \u2013 Regularly include fish in diet (Japan)\n\n'Japan recommends having 3-5 servings of fish per day, and fish recommendations is also given in government food guides from all over the world from Kenya to Malaysia,' George explained.\n\n'Japan recommends one of the largest servings compared to other countries, and the benefits of introducing more fish into the diet include omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for the brain.\n\n'Fish is also considered one of the most \u2018heart-healthy\u2019 foods and those who eat fish regularly have a lower risk of heart attacks, strokes and developing heart disease,' he added.\n\nDON\u2019T \u2013 Have a salt-heavy diet (China)\n\nWhilst the seven fruit and veg servings per day was good advice from China, Geroge stressed that some other recommendation were to take with caution.\n\n'China\u2019s obesity rate has increased over the past decade, and the government has acknowledged it\u2019s down to an over-consumption of salt and oil in citizen\u2019s diets,' he said.\n\n'China\u2019s cuisine involves foods such as soy sauce, which has an incredibly high salt content and can contribute to this over-consumption,' he explained.\n\nEating too much salt can lead to increased blood pressure, ultimately enhancing the strain on the heart, arteries and kidneys. High blood pressure is one of the integral causes of conditions such as strokes, heart attacks and kidney disease.\n\nDON\u2019T \u2013 Set amount of \u2018biscuits\u2019 per week (Italy)\n\n'Italy\u2019s government food recommendations suggest that having 1 biscuit a day (7 per week) is an appropriate amount to consume.\n\n'Whilst it\u2019s clear that the Italians are trying to limit consumption of sugary treats such as biscuits to one a day, the guidelines are ambiguous \u2013 with some biscuits being covered in additional sugar, or chocolate,' George explained.\n\n'It\u2019s hard to gauge what biscuit would be acceptable, and also could promote overeating the wrong kind of foods,' he went on.\n\n'Whilst biscuits can be enjoyed in moderation, this recommendation is confusing.'\n\nDON\u2019T \u2013 Go for \u2018greasy\u2019 foods (Greece)\n\nGreece actually recommends 'greasy' food once to twice week.\n\n'Whilst oil can be an integral part of a Mediterranean diet, preparation of certain foods in oil or cooking with oil can vary greatly,' George explained.\n\n'A \"serving\" guide can be ambiguous, so suggesting an exact measurement could be beneficial to prevent over-consumption of oily or greasy foods,' he added.\n\nDON\u2019T \u2013 Over-consume fermented milk (Kenya)\n\nKeynan food guidelines advocate for consuming fermented milk daily, George explained.\n\n'Whilst consuming fermented milk can be beneficial for those with lactose intolerance, it can be known to reduce blood pressure \u2013 and therefore could become too low for those who already live with existing low blood pressure,' he added.\n\nDON\u2019T \u2013 Confuse your carbs (Italy)\n\n'Whilst some governments such as Italy recommend having 2-3 servings of bread a day, it\u2019s important to remember that different types of bread contains different nutritional benefits,' George said.\n\n'Avoid white breads and stick to wholemeal, high fibre alternatives which contains less highly-processed flours and additives. All these can cause erratic blood-sugar levels, increasing the risk of conditions such as type-2 diabetes.'\n\nThe Hospital Group provide weight loss and cosmetic surgeries in clinics and hospitals around the UK.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: George Hamlyn-Williams, principal dietitian from The Hospital Group, UK, told FEMAIL which nutritional guidelines from other countries we should be following to lose weight.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/08/19956058-0-image-a-4_1571641325269.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
