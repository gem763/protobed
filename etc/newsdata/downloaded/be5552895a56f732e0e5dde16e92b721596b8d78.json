He stressed the importance of officials acting and working together to combat climate change, as there is physical evidence that the world is changing for the worst\n\nThese include investigations into how aspects of the human body are affected by microgravity and how astronauts could control robots remotely during lunar exploration.\n\nAnd when Parmitano was asked by a child before heading to space which planet he would most like to explore as an astronaut, his answer was simple: Earth.\n\n'From up here, the answer is clearer than ever,' Parmitano, who is also the first-ever Italian space station commander, said in a video from the European Space Agency.\n\n'There is absolutely no place like home.'\n\nIn the video, Parmitano addressed leaders attending the United Nations Climate Summit, which took place in New York on Sept. 23.\n\nHe stressed the importance of officials acting now and working together to combat climate change, as there is physical evidence that the world is changing for the worst.\n\nWHAT IS THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION? The International Space Station (ISS) is a $100 billion (\u00a380 billion) science and engineering laboratory that orbits 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. It has been permanently staffed by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts since November 2000. Research conducted aboard the ISS often requires one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit, such as low-gravity or oxygen. ISS studies have investigated human research, space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology. The US space agency, Nasa, spends about $3 billion (\u00a32.4 billion) a year on the space station program, a level of funding that is endorsed by the Trump administration and Congress. A U.S. House of Representatives committee that oversees Nasa has begun looking at whether to extend the program beyond 2024. Alternatively the money could be used to speed up planned human space initiatives to the moon and Mars.\n\n'Our planet Earth, with its vast and varied terrain, is a constant source of wonder to astronauts on the International Space Station,' Parmitano said in the video.\n\n'Every time we look out the cupola window, we see a new and incredible view \u2026 [that] reminds us just how precious and fragile our Earth is.'\n\nParmitano called attention to the impact humans have had on the planet and the effects of global warming, which he linked to the intense heat waves experienced around the world and the growing intensity of hurricanes.\n\n'Human impact is visible and tangible, and unless we take coordinated action now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and stop, if not reverse, global warming, we stand to lose much, much more,' Parmitano said.\n\n'The Paris Agreement and the work you do as leaders in the United Nations 2019 Climate Action Summit in New York is important.'\n\nHowever, to limit climate change and global warming, the focus of international organizations needs to turn into real action, Parmitano said.\n\n'The race is on \u2014 but it's a race against time and we must win. It's time to act now, across national borders,' Parmitano said in the video.\n\n'We must go beyond what we're doing now to protect the future of our planet for the good of those who will come long after we're gone.'\n\nParmitano made headlines just in August when he became the first DJ in orbit.\n\nThe unlikely achievement comes after he played a set from the International Space Station's Columbus module, this week.\n\nHis performance was transmitted via satellite to a cruise ship of 3,000 clubbers in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAccording to the European Space Agency, the 42-year-old used music 'to connect across cultures' and illustrate the advances in space technology.\n\nPreviously, he took part in a record-breaking ZeroG 2.0 flight, where he performed a DJ set in zero gravity alongside fifty celebrities and special guests.\n\nHowever, this is the very first time an astronaut has played a DJ set while in space.", "description": "Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano sent a messae to the UN from the International Space Station calling for swift action to combat global warming --because there's 'no place like home'.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/19/19455256-0-image-a-43_1570559163141.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
