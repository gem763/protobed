My body was convulsing. The women who kept me company screamed and called 911.\"\n\nHe was taken to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas where doctors discovered the enormous extent of the damage and gave him just four hours to live.\n\n\"There was an unholy concoction of cocaine, cognac and cannabis coursing through my veins. My heart stopped twice,\" Lamar explained.\n\n(Image: Mariotto/fresh/boricio INFphoto.com)\n\n(Image: AKM-GSI)\n\n\"I had twelve seizures and six strokes. My lungs collapsed and my kidneys ruptured. I was on life support. Everyone I\u2019d ever loved was looking at me through bleary eyes.\u201d\n\nDespite their estrangement, Khloe rushed to his side and halted divorce proceedings to allow her to make medical decisions on his behalf.\n\nThe reality star maintained a bedside vigil for three days, not even leaving to shower and sleeping on hospital chairs pushed together as her husband lay comatose.\n\n(Image: AKM-GSI)\n\n(Image: khloewithak.com)\n\nLamar finally woke up on October 16 but was struck with horror when he realised he couldn't walk or talk.\n\n\u201cWaking up, I was pulling the tubes out of my throat,\u201d he told People magazine. \u201cAnd I was trying to talk but I couldn\u2019t get the words out. That was the scariest part. And not being able to walk. I\u2019m a big athlete you know?\u201d\n\nHe was eventually transferred to a hospital in Los Angeles, where he spent three months learning to walk again before heading to rehab.\n\nAnd the effects of the strokes and heart seizures are still with him four years on.\n\nWith his balance and co-ordination shot, his NBA career was destroyed overnight.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cFrom the stroke, some of my balance is not the same, my equilibrium is not the same... I think that\u2019s the coma and stroke and heart attack,\u201d he told the New York Daily News.\n\nLamar - who is due to compete on Dancing With The Stars - also suffers \"horrible memory loss\" and has major issues with his long-term memory too.\n\nHowever, he believes the life-changing damage is a fair trade for being alive.\n\n\u201cI think God made a deal with me. He said, \u2018I\u2019m going to give you life, but I\u2019m going to take your basketball skills,'\" he said.\n\n\"But I don\u2019t mind working to get it back. It\u2019s going to be a tedious process, but it\u2019ll come back.\"\n\nLamar first started taking cocaine at 24 but fell victim to the grips of addiction when his six-month-old son Jayden died in his crib from sudden infant death syndrome in 2006.\n\nHe continued to abuse narcotics after marrying Khloe in 2009, and admitted the lowest point in his life came when she caught him in a hotel room with another woman doing drugs.\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\n\"At that point in my life, I was doing coke every day. Pretty much every second of free time that I had, I was doing coke. I couldn\u2019t control it. I didn\u2019t want to control it,\" he told The Players' Tribune.\n\n\"One of the darkest places I\u2019ve ever been was when I was in a motel room, getting high with this chick, and my wife walked in.\n\n\"My d**k and my habit took me down all the roads that you don\u2019t ever wanna go down.\"", "description": "Lamar Odom was given just hours to live after a mammoth drug binge at the Love Ranch in Nevada ended with him convulsing on the floor", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Getty Images For Yeezy Season", "Splash", "Mariotto Fresh Boricio Infphoto.Com", "Akm-Gsi", "Khloewithak.Com", "Getty", "Getty Images", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16227688.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MAIN-The-View-Lamar-Odom.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
