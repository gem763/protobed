It\u2019s the first British hypercar and the first electric vehicle (EV) built by Lotus of Hethel, England.\n\nEvija, pronounced \u201ceh-vai-jah,\u201d is unlike any other car. Its curves and \u201cporous\u201d design make not only for interesting visuals, but also for an outstanding aerodynamic profile. Instead of slicing the air as it speeds, as other cars do, the Evija was designed to encourage air flow through openings in its chassis.\n\nThat increases the car\u2019s efficiency and stability while being propelled by four electric motors pushing almost 2,000 horsepower combined, enabling it to reach a top speed of 217 miles per hour. Lotus hasn\u2019t tested this number yet, but according to the company, the car can accelerate from 0-60 mph in less than 3 seconds. That alone could give Tesla\u2019s TSLA, +1.76% Model S a run for its money when the numbers come in. (Tesla claims its upcoming new Roadster goes 0-60 in 1.9 seconds. Remember, also, that Tesla\u2019s first car, the original Roadster, was a heavily modified Lotus Elise.) Lotus claims the Evija can reach 186 mph in less than 9 seconds, which is \u201cbetter than any other direct competitor,\u201d the company says.\n\nLotus\u2019 hypercar should be able to reach 250 miles before its 70 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery runs out of juice. Recharging up to 80% of the battery\u2019s capacity at an 800-volt, 350 kW, Level 3 fast charger will take 12 minutes, while you\u2019d need to wait additional six minutes for a full charge. Impressive, but still not the world\u2019s fastest-charging battery pack despite the company\u2019s claim \u2014 the Porsche Taycan\u2019s battery charges from 0-100% in only 15 minutes. It\u2019s powerful, nevertheless, when we take into account enormous power-hungry motors and electronics.\n\nJet fighter\n\nWhile the exterior is incredible looking, the interior is equally beautiful. The main console is clean and high-tech-looking, almost resembling a futuristic fighter jet. From the hexagonal, honeycomb-like structure of the dashboard buttons, to the fully digital central console perched above the racing-style wheel, every element seems to be carefully thought out and put together. Holes and curved, open spaces between surfaces go well together with the overall porous theme of the car, and its elegance is emphasized by Alcantara-lined seats and steering wheel.\n\nThe Evija offers technical amenities and novelties one would expect from vehicles in its price range, and these are only a few: Instead of classic \u201cmirror-based\u201d headlights, the car features laser lights to light up the road. Mirrors are replaced by pop-up cameras that display images taken at various angles behind the car. Evija is equipped with dihedral doors lacking handles \u2014 they open only via a key fob. Finally, a companion app can be used to display the information about the car and access its many features.\n\nAfter a decade-plus hiatus, the Lotus Evija was introduced not only as a British hypercar flagship, but also as a statement: The company is still alive and kicking. The same could not have been said only a few years ago; since the layoff of Lotus\u2019 CEO in 2012, the road had been rocky for the British car company until it was acquired by Geely, a privately held global automotive group based in China. Already owners of Volvo, Geely took hold of Lotus in 2017, and judging by the Evija, things are looking up.\n\nThis car isn\u2019t for everyone, though, and the British manufacturer wanted to make sure of that. Lotus plans to produce only 130 of these beauties, making the Evija one of the scarcest cars on the planet. If quantity wasn\u2019t prohibitive enough, the price most likely will be: The model goes for a little over $2.1 million. If you want to secure yours, make sure to put in a $300,000 deposit, and the vehicle will be yours in 2020.\n\nRead other electric-vehicle features on MarketWatch:\n\n\u2022 Tesla\u2019s unveiling of a pickup truck is right around the corner\n\n\u2022 These two electric cars include solar panels \u2014 and could be on the road in 2021\n\n\u2022 Move over, Ferrari and Lamborghini \u2014 this Italian electric car\u2019s 1,900 horsepower makes it faster than a Formula 1 racer\n\n\u2022 Tesla\u2019s mega-fast Model S finally has a challenger: the Porsche Taycan\n\nJurica Dujmovic is a MarketWatch columnist.", "description": "The $2.1 million Evija is the first Lotus model since China\u2019s Geely took control of the British car company.", "authors": ["Jurica Dujmovic"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ486_lotus__MG_20190830112847.jpg"}
