Referee Frank Willenborg was advised to check on video replays but didn\u2019t award a spot kick.\n\nSimon Terodde scored a brilliant opening goal in the 14th minute for Cologne - turning smartly and firing in after Jonas Hector had played the ball forward to Schindler with his heel - but Mainz struck back with three goals to climb out of the relegation zone.\n\nJean-Paul Boetius equalized seven minutes later, then set up Robin Quaison to let fly for the home side\u2019s second in the 57th.\n\nLevin \u00d6ztunali capitalized on a mistake from goalkeeper Timo Horn to seal the win in the 82nd. Horn had the near post covered but the midfielder\u2019s shot still got through.\n\nLeft to rue a fine performance from Mainz goalkeeper Robin Zentner, Cologne is in the relegation zone ahead of the rest of the ninth round.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mainz beat Cologne 3-1 at home in the Bundesliga on Friday after the visitors were denied what looked a clear penalty despite VAR.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
