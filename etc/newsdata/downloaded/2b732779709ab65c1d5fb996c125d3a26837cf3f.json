The shares fell 58% between January and the beginning of August, but Mallinckrodt bondholders hung tough.\n\nThat ended on Aug. 28, when the company said it had used up the final $95 million in its revolving credit facility. The April 2020 bond started to crash. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Mallinckrodt had hired restructuring advisors and was exploring a possible bankruptcy.\n\nBy Friday, the bond was valued at 55.7 cents on the dollar, implying a yield of 134.2%.\n\nEquities fell on the Bloomberg story, too, but rebounded slightly on Friday, when Mallinckrodt said it reached a tentative settlement with two Ohio counties that will allow it to sit out of a key coming trial. The stock closed Friday up 17.9%, after falling 38.6% on Thursday.\n\nYet bond traders appear to have turned decidedly against the firm.\n\n\u201cWe see a real possibility that certain financially-vulnerable, opioid-exposed drugmakers (i.e. Purdue, Endo and Mallinckrodt) could consider a bankruptcy filing in order to effectuate the establishment of a settlement trust,\u201d wrote CreditInsights analyst Eric Axon in a note out Friday, referring to an entity set up to pay out opioid settlements. \u201cWhile this outcome could free Mallinckrodt from current and future opioid-related legal liabilities, it would very likely represent a negative development for MNK bondholders.\u201d\n\nAxon has a Sell recommendation on Mallinckrodt\u2019s senior unsecured debt.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMallinckrodt is one of a handful of opioid defendants carrying significant debt burdens.\n\nNet debt at Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) amounts to 6.2 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, well above the overall ratio of 1.6 times for the S&P 500 Health Care sector. The figure is 4.9 times at Mallinckrodt and 5.4 at Endo International (ENDP).\n\nBond investors have long been down on Endo. Its $1.6 billion bond maturing in July 2023 is valued at 61.0 cents on the dollar, and has been priced below 75 cents since May.\n\nInvestors appear more confident in Teva\u2019s ability to repay its bonds. The stock is down 54.7% so far this year, but the company\u2019s bond maturing in July 2021 is valued at 92.6 cents on the dollar.\n\nThat is likely because Teva is far larger than the other two companies. It had free cash flow of $3.5 billion in 2018, many times more than at either Mallinckrodt or Endo.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "A $700 million bond maturing next April was valued at 55.7 cents on the dollar on Friday.", "authors": ["Josh Nathan-Kazis"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-104855/social"}
