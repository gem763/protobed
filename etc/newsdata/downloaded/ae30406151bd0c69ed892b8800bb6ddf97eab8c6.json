And when the ones at the very front pull back, it becomes a traffic jam,\" Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said.\n\nThe company had previously warned that a slowdown in demand for microchips that started late last year may last a few more quarters, as China's economy slows and manufacturers face the fallout of an ongoing trade dispute with the United States.\n\nTexas said it expected revenue for the fourth quarter in the range of $3.07 billion and $3.33 billion, below analysts' average expectation of $3.59 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.", "description": "Texas Instruments Inc forecast current-quarter revenue well below estimates on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104202133-GettyImages-158520068.jpg?v=1532563945", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
