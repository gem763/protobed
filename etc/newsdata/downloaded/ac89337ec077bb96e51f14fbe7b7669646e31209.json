Although questions remain as to whether it\u2019s worth upgrading at all, if your iPhone is less than five years old.\n\nThe Guardian will have its own reviews of the new iPhones in the next week or so once they have gone on sale, but in the meantime here\u2019s what those given early access by Apple had to say.\n\niPhone 11\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The iPhone 11 comes in a variety of colours with an aluminium body and glass front and back. Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA\n\nCosting from \u00a3729, the iPhone 11 has a 6.1in LCD screen, two cameras on the back but the same processor and storage sizes as the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nNilay Patel from the Verge praised the iPhone 11\u2019s battery, but wasn\u2019t so happy about the included charger:\n\nIn our tests, the iPhone 11 easily lasted a full day at a time and then some. It\u2019s possible you could manage to kill this battery in less than a day, but you\u2019d have to really try. The battery life is great, just like the iPhone XR\u2019s battery life was great. What\u2019s less great is the fact that Apple is still putting its ancient 5W charger in the box, even though the iPhone 11 Pro has an 18W USB-C fast charger. If Apple isn\u2019t going to update the entire line to a fast charger, it should just do the environment a favour and stop putting the 5W charger in the box entirely; there are literally billions of them in the world, and odds are, you have more than one in a drawer already.\n\nBritta O\u2019Boyle and Stuart Miles from Pocket-lint said most will be happy with the LCD display of the iPhone 11, but corners have been cut:\n\nIn reality, the iPhone 11 has a display that will more than satisfy most users. It\u2019s not as sharp in resolution as the likes of the iPhone 11 Pro, or the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 for example, and it doesn\u2019t offer mobile HDR compatibility like these other devices either, but the iPhone 11 still offers a decent screen with ample brightness and arguably more realistic colours than the Pro models and other OLED smartphones. The omission of HDR on the iPhone 11 means that while it tries to deliver a HDR-like experience for compatible content, it\u2019s not the real deal. Smart HDR pictures don\u2019t pop as much when viewing on screen as they do on the iPhone 11 Pro, and you can\u2019t see as much detail on a dark TV show or movie that\u2019s available in HDR, as you can on the 11 Pro - but it\u2019s also one of the few compromises the iPhone 11 makes to the Pro models.\n\nThe iPhone 11\u2019s improved selfie camera now with slow-motion selfies was a magnet for Cnet\u2019s Scott Stein\u2019s kids:\n\nThe wider-angled front-facing camera is welcome, and digitally zooms in or out to accommodate a wider view that fits in more people and background. The 12-megapixel front-facing camera looks better, and I was happy with the results, but you have to be artful with the wider camera. Sometimes I ended up looking like a little face in a mountain of shirt. My kids instantly started messing around with slow-motion selfie feature. Yes, that\u2019s the Slofie. It\u2019s not a Live Photo, though. It\u2019s just a video mode. That makes it hard to do much with, because the file sizes get large. I do, however, have a lot of extended 240-fps slow-motion scenes of my kids sticking out their tongues.\n\nWired\u2019s Lauren Goode was impressed by Apple\u2019s new dual-camera on the iPhone 11:\n\nThis year\u2019s iPhone 11 has two rear lenses, a wide-angle lens and an ultrawide lens with a 120-degree field of view. Last year\u2019s iPhone XR had a single lens, and any depth effects added to photos were done computationally. This means the iPhone 11 now captures enough information to take better photos from the start\u2014and especially portrait photos. Case in point: Last year\u2019s iPhone XR could capture a portrait photo of a person but not a pet or object. The iPhone 11 now takes portrait photos of my cat, which he is pleased about. Just kidding: He is indifferent, per usual. The iPhone 11 is a very good camera, and in a lot of situations it even performed better than last year\u2019s top-of-the-line iPhone XS. But the iPhone 11 Pro takes noticeably better photos, whether standard photos, portrait images, or night mode pics.\n\nRhiannon Williams from i News predicts the splash of colour of the new iPhone 11 models to be a big draw, as the smartphone industry moves away from dull black and grey:\n\nLike the XR and 5c series before it, a large part of the iPhone 11\u2019s appeal lies in its range of six shades: red, black, white, yellow, green and purple. This is the first ever purple iPhone, and Apple has chosen the Instagram-baiting shade of lilac popularised by the likes of Ariana Grande and South Korean pop sensations BTS \u2013 Generation Z\u2019s equivalent of millennial pink. It\u2019s pretty \u2013 a stylish splash of lavender Apple knows will have aesthetically-minded iPhone owners clamouring to upgrade (as evidenced by its new range of transparent cases). These are phones to be shown off, not hidden behind rubber or leather sheaths, and even if you do cover it up with a case, Apple is banking on the satisfaction of owning phone in a colour you\u2019re attached to.\n\nGareth Beavis from TechRadar was won over by the iPhone 11:\n\nOverall the iPhone 11 is a triumph for Apple - if, for nothing else, the fact it\u2019s managed to lower the price year-on-year. We feel enough people are going to be won over by the hard-working camera \u2026 and the safety that buying a modern smartphone gives you. You should be able to achieve years of use from this phone, and sure, you could also consider the iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max if you want more power and higher spec, but we found the iPhone 11 to be fun to use and often outperformed what we would expect given the price \u2013 and that\u2019s a feat some wouldn\u2019t have expected from Apple.\n\nBrian X Chen from the New York Times has a slightly different view, asking whether it\u2019s still worth upgrading your iPhone every two years:\n\nBased on my tests of the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, the answer is no. Don\u2019t get me wrong: The newest models are nice. Apple has made them speedier, improved the cameras and lengthened their battery life. The new lineup also starts at a lower price of $700, down from $750 a year ago, which is a relief in an era of skyrocketing smartphone costs. But none of this is enough to warrant an immediate upgrade if you have had your smartphone for only two years. The latest iPhones just aren\u2019t a big leap forward from last year\u2019s iPhones or even the iPhone X from 2017. So here\u2019s what I ultimately suggest: You should definitely upgrade if your current device is at least five years old. The iPhone 11 models are all a significant step up from those introduced in 2014. But for everyone else with smartphones from 2015 or later, there is no rush to buy. Instead, there is more mileage and value to be had out of the excellent smartphone you already own.\n\niPhone 11 Pro\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The camera is the main focus of the iPhone 11 Pro.

They also have a new triple camera system on the back \u2013 their main differentiator over the significantly cheaper model.\n\nPatel was less complimentary about the battery life on the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It\u2019s better but not quite enough to prevent battery anxiety:\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max I\u2019ve been using every day for a week has consistently run for 12 to 14 hours on a single charge, with over 10 hours of screen-on time reported in the battery settings per 24-hour period. That\u2019s compared to 8 to 10 hours of battery life at most for my iPhone XS Max, which is a marked improvement. It\u2019s not enough to make me stop charging at my desk throughout the day, and I\u2019ll definitely still carry a battery pack on trips.\n\nWilliams could see the improvements in Super Retina XDR screen making an excellent screen better in a small but meaningful way:\n\nApple has chosen to stick to the same resolution as last year\u2019s handsets but has spruced them up with a new OLED panel with a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio called Super Retina XDR. In practice, this means the displays are both bolder and brighter and display colours more accurately. I found this was best exemplified when examining skin tones in the same pictures side-by-side with the iPhone XS Max. Caucasian skin on the XS Max appears pinker and more flushed, whereas the same picture looks truer-to-life. Likewise, the 11 Pro Max picks out facial highlights and hair undertones not as apparent in the same picture over on the XS Max. It\u2019s a small difference, but an impressive one.\n\nStein says there are essentially two reasons to pick the iPhone 11 Pro Max over the smaller 11 Pro:\n\nThis year\u2019s most expensive iPhone is the $1,449 (\u00a31,499) iPhone Pro Max with 512GB of storage. Even with 256GB of storage \u2013 the minimum you\u2019ll likely want for a high-end phone like this \u2013 it will set you back $1,249 (\u00a31,299). There are two main reasons to go for this year\u2019s most extreme iPhone: Either you want that larger OLED display (2,688\u00d71,242 versus 2,436\u00d71,125 for the Pro) or you want that extra hour of battery life. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend this much. But if you really are using your phone as a professional camera and you want to see every pixel, you want the best viewfinder and editing display you can get. And, well, this would be that phone. It\u2019s also more fun for movies and games, but at these prices, I\u2019d just buy a separate iPad for that.\n\nBeavis felt that the expense of the iPhone 11 Pro was difficult to justify:\n\nOverall, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is a real step forward, and the most advanced iPhone yet. However, when thinking about what\u2019s truly new here, we weren\u2019t able to single out much beyond the improved camera (especially Night mode) and the slightly upgraded cinematic experience. If you want to save some money, we\u2019d suggest checking out the iPhone 11 \u2013 while we constantly found little nuggets of impressive performance throughout our testing of the 11 Pro Max, we couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that this is really only a phone for the Apple fan who wants the best of everything, with no compromises.\n\nGoode found the all-important camera on the iPhone 11 Pro Max to be a mixed bag:", "description": "Early reviews of Apple\u2019s latest suggest colour, battery and lower price make the iPhone 11 a winner", "authors": ["Samuel Gibbs"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66681e097997e92c27e14cf4b657b642d805d23d/0_298_5463_3276/master/5463.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fd4776cb004a39586d06e7c40d7b2554", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
