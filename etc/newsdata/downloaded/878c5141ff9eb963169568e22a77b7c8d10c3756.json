The tax on homes sold for between to $1 million to $2 million remained at 1%.\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter, though, sales dropped 14.2% compared to the same period last year, according to Douglas Elliman.\n\n\n\n\u201cThough we saw sales decline rather significantly this quarter, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that many sales were achieved over the summer by buyers rushing to file ahead of the mansion tax deadline,\u201d said Steven James, president and CEO of Douglas Elliman, New York City, in the report. \u201cThe combined sales for the second and third quarters of 2019 are only down slightly from the same time period last year, and I suspect that with mortgage rates remaining low and sellers loosening their hold on unrealistic pricing positions, the largest declines are behind us.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlongside the tax increases, a shift in buyer demographics is also affecting the market, with foreign buyers now accounting for fewer purchases, according to a report from brokerage Warburg Realty.\n\n\n\n\u201cRussians completely disappeared from our high-end market years ago, and most Chinese buyers feel hesitant, caught between a slowing economy at home and a hostile government in the United States,\u201d wrote Frederick Warburg Peters, CEO of Warburg Realty in the report.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Munich Ranks as Most Overvalued Global Market, at Risk of Bubble\n\nTransactions were hit hardest in the luxury market, where the mansion tax is highest, according to a separate report from Halstead. The brokerage found that sales of condos and co-ops priced over $5 million fell 48% in the third quarter compared to the same time last year.\n\n\n\nThe fall in high-end transactions helped to drag down the median sale price for Manhattan apartments, which in the third quarter stood at $999,950, a 17% decline year-over-year, according to another report from brokerage CORE.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile prices have certainly come down, the average and median sale prices are more a reflection of what price points are trading,\u201d said Garrett Derderian, managing director of market analysis at CORE. \u201cRight now, activity is concentrated well below $3 million.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Compass, which also released its report Wednesday, only 9% of transactions were priced above $3 million between July and September, the lowest proportion logged since 2015.\n\n\n\nCondos and co-ops priced between $1 million and $3 million accounted for the greatest share of transactions at 39% of all deals. The $500,000 to $1 million bracket closely followed with 36%, the report said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-112759?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280"}
