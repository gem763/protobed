She then publicly accused Rebekah Vardy, the wife of England footballer Jamie, of being the individual whose account was responsible, setting off a chain of events that challenges the way tabloid journalists do business.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest the \u201cWagileaks\u201d scandal, which has led to the unusual sight of the Sun writing front page articles about its own editorial processes, highlights the question facing celebrities as print circulations decline: is it wise to continue to engage with traditional outlets and attempt to win favourable coverage? Or can celebrities adopt a position of all-out war against an industry in decline and rally popular support from their millions of Instagram followers?\n\n\u201cVardy mentioned in her statement [in which she denied leaking the stories] that she doesn\u2019t need the money but celebrities also have a relationship to consider when they deal with the press; they want to stay in their good books and make sure they don\u2019t get turned over,\u201d said Chris Lochery, a writer at the celebrity and media gossip newsletter Popbitch. He also suggested that as celebrities publish so much material on their personal media accounts for free, tabloid journalists are choosing to dig deeper for exclusives. \u201cIf they can get someone\u2019s close friends\u2019 Instagram it\u2019s an inside track \u2013 it\u2019s the private version of social media.\u201d\n\nVardy \u2013 who follows on Instagram two of the Sun journalists who wrote some of the disputed stories and has worked with the newspaper in the past \u2013 continues to protest her innocence. She has suggested her Instagram account could have been hacked and has employed unidentified \u2018forensic\u2019 computer experts to analyse it but does not intend to reveal what they find. Although sharing social media account passwords is risky, it is not unusual in a world where influencers often rely on management teams to post updates on their behalf.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Vardy said discussing the issue with Rooney was like \u201carguing with a pigeon\u201d on the basis that \u201cyou can tell it that you are right and it is wrong but it\u2019s still going to shit in your hair\u201d.\n\nKate Randall, news editor at celebrity magazine Heat, said the Rooney story revealed the limits to celebrities\u2019 public social media accounts, which sell themselves as a chance to have an authentic insight into a prominent individual\u2019s life. \u201cThey have allowed these fans into what they think is their real life but as Coleen shows she\u2019s not really allowing the fans into her real life. Most celebrities have probably got private Instagram accounts which show what\u2019s going on in their lives but the public one is what they want to be seen and their brand.\u201d\n\nWhoever hacked Rebekah Vardy\u2019s Insta was obviously never at Baden-Baden Read more\n\nShe also suggested that a wider distrust of the media had given celebrities the power to shut down truthful stories and turn their supporters on publications: \u201cCelebs have the power to go on Instagram and - even if you know it\u2019s true \u2013 say this is false.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, print newspaper sales continue to plummet with the Sun\u2019s circulation badly hit in particular. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s tabloid now sells just 1.2m copies a day, down from 3m at the start of the decade. The Daily Mail is likely to overtake it imminently as Britain\u2019s best-selling paper. At the same time,the Sun has been going through a cost-saving round of redundancies while its publisher is dealing with lawsuits from Prince Harry and England cricket Ben Stokes.\n\nThis has left it with fewer resources for paying sources and seeking out original material, and threatens its entire model of exclusives resulting in increased revenue. The Sun\u2019s exclusives often appear on MailOnline and the Mirror\u2019s websites within minutes of being published, challenging the economic rationale for a news outlet to pay a celebrity journalist to go out of their way to seek scoops. At the same time, publicists are increasingly adept at advising their clients to publish material directly on to social media, allowing them to control the narrative without having to deal with the irritation of journalists.\n\nJonathan Hartley, a media consultant who specialises in crisis communications and regularly deals with the tabloids, said that the audiences for tabloid websites such as MailOnline can still make a massive difference to an individual\u2019s profile. He also insisted there is still a place for the celebrity journalist seeking a scoop in the face of a stream of Instagram content: \u201cWhat they add is the stories that the celebrities don\u2019t want out there. Potentially they are more interesting than the well-manicured stories that have been put on social media.\u201d\n\nRather than undermining the rationale of gossip journalism in the modern era, he suggested that the reason that the Rooney story has resonated so widely is that the footballer\u2019s wife and her management team have invested the time, effort and money to break an old-fashioned juicy tabloid story that the public want to read.\n\n\u201cThe strange position is that she is doing the job of a celebrity journalist, where she has put out something that another celebrity doesn\u2019t want out there.\u201d", "description": "Coleen Rooney\u2019s accusation showed celebs can use power of social media to bypass press", "authors": ["Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2202cbac312519259e2b06fbc10908b094caea5/0_0_2966_1780/master/2966.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db035bebfa4ca9516e9dd57e7908a482", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
