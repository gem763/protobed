Northrop Grumman built the lunar module of the Apollo era, while Draper provided its guidance computers.\n\nTogether, the four companies will respond to NASA\u2019s call for tenders on November 1.\n\nIn May, NASA announced it had asked 11 companies to carry out studies and produce prototypes of human landers for the Artemis program.\n\nBesides Blue Origin, these included Boeing, SpaceX, the Sierra Nevada Corporation and others.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Jeff Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin and the richest man in the world, announced Tuesday a partnership with three of the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/c3504a_blue-origin-as-prime-contractor-provide-descent-element-vehicle-based-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
