And he was the one brought up on charges, and he was reduced in rank.\"\n\nBut her father soldiered on, Baken said, \"Because he loved the military. And it was because of him that I loved the military.\"\n\nLike her father, Baken says she too faced racism, and the mental toll it took was only made worse by the sexism she also says she faced.\n\n\"The guys loved watching women walk away from them, and they would make their comments,\" she said. \"So I made sure I wore a foundation garment so nothing moved. It was just the way we women handled it then.\"\n\nShe wanted to be a role model for younger women below her rank.\n\n\"I tried to be \u2014 for some of my young people coming up \u2014 their person that they could look to to see someone who led with integrity.\"\n\nIt wasn't always easy. There were times when the mental exhaustion from dealing with discrimination would leave her physically worn out. Baken remembered one interaction with an enlisted female officer in particular.\n\n\"I remember I was walking across a hall, and one woman came up on me and she said, 'You're stooping. Don't ever do that. We're very proud of you.' And that startled me, and I stood up straight and kept walking.\"\n\nAfter that incident, Baken turned down an assignment that could have gotten her promoted from colonel to general. She was ready for a change.\n\n\n\n\"If I was beginning to stoop, somehow maybe they were winning and I didn't realize,\" she said. \"And doggone it, no! I just didn't wanna do it anymore. I wanted out.\"\n\nSo, in 2003, Baken made the decision to move on. She retired from the military, and went on to earn a Ph.D. in biodefense from George Mason University. She now runs her own consulting firm, advising the Department of Defense.\n\nAudio produced for Weekend Edition by Aisha Turner.\n\nStoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.
