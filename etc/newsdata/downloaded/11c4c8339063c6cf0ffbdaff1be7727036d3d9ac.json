The conservative newspaper Le Figaro commented that real action was needed, not just words.\n\nVanik Berberian, the independent mayor of Gargilesse-Dampierre in central France, said: \u201cThe state is finally starting to really understand the potential of rural areas, but this realisation is dulled by a centralist mentality.\u201d\n\nMr Berberian, 64, the head of the national association of rural mayors, urged the central government to stop excluding mayors from decision-making.\n\nThe rural plan represents Mr Macron\u2019s latest attempt to win over voters likely to be tempted by the far Right anti-immigration policies of Marine Le Pen.\n\nThis week he promised tougher action against bogus asylum-seekers, saying the government\u2019s \u201chumanist\u201d approach to immigration was driving voters into the arms of the far Right.\n\nConcerned about the threat of autumn strikes, Mr Macron has slowed the pace of business-friendly reforms, trying to shed his elitist image in favour of a gentler, more empathetic style. He is planning public consultations on pension reform proposals aimed at raising the average retirement age and ending preferential schemes for public-sector workers.", "description": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government sought to calm discontent in \u201cleft-behind\u201d rural areas on Friday by announcing an \u201caction plan\u201d to improve public services in the countryside.", "authors": ["David Chazan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nhK42tnoQjtFQmqhaZYUUg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/e47b72674f16f6fad25a2ce59bc82681", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
