What if sentiment change influences price action? The problem is the measurement. Price change measurement is instantaneous, but sentiment measurement is lagging. The risk in this statement trends toward confirmation bias, which is the tendency for one to search for, interpret, focus on, and remember in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.\n\nIn short, if you believe price changes sentiment, then you will find information to support that thesis -- after the fact.\n\nWhat I see is an expression of confidence. When you are winning and profiting, you tend to be louder. The media calls on the most bullish of bulls to come speak to their viewing audience, if we are headed higher. When we are headed lower, they call on the doomsday sayers.\n\nAdditionally, price action defines momentum trading. Momentum traders want to follow direction. Given the number of algorithmic traders, along with home-gamers, momentum trading dominates compared to contrarian traders. The technical traders I know would rather buy breakouts -- stocks moving above resistance -- than trying to guess a bottom or vice verse.\n\nFurthermore, what benefit does the statement provide to investors, traders, or even for strategy? I can understand playing contrarian or waving the yellow flag for extreme sentiment, but I see it constantly bantered about on three-day moves, two-day moves, and sometimes a single-day reversal. There's nothing we can take from it. Zero. Zip. Zilch.\n\nAnd I haven't even touched on the potential of confirmation bias. It's quite possible those making the statement, search out interviews, articles, and statements to support the idea that price changes sentiment.\n\nHere's what I find most ironic: Price is sentiment. Price reflects supply and demand. Demand is the desire to buy. Supply is the desire to sell. Both of those are a reflection of sentiment.\n\nI believe the better saying is: Nothing like a change in price to reflect a change in sentiment.\n\nI mention this because we're bound to see it in oil Monday. The risks around the commodity have changed with the drone strikes in Saudi Arabia. The disruption in supply should be easily absorbed by the rest of the market, but sentiment around the commodity changed before price. In theory, that shouldn't be possible if the statement we began with is absolute.\n\nTo add to this, the first folks I saw tweeting about the gap higher in oil prices in Sunday night were looking to short the commodity, not buy it. Again, that shouldn't be the case if price is changing sentiment. The saying does not work on a cognitive level.\n\nAs for oil, jumps of 10%, 15%, or nearly 20% reflect fear of further attacks and disruptions. Price is rising to reflect risk of supply. I wouldn't chase it here, but I will give underlying companies in energy a look as well as transportation. Any beatings in the trucking or airline sector could be an opportunity if you believe the reaction overdone on oil. That's how I'm leaning, but we'll see how trading looks in the early going Monday before making any moves.", "description": "The risks around oil have changed with the drone strikes in Saudi Arabia, and while disruption in supply should be easily absorbed by the rest of the market, sentiment changed before price.", "authors": ["Timothy Collins", "Here'S A Crude Idea", "Price Is Sentiment", "The Risks Around Oil Have Changed With The Drone Strikes In Saudi Arabia -- But While Disruption In Supply Should Be Easily Absorbed The Rest Of The Market", "Sentiment Changed Before Price.", "Dave Butler", "Chris Versace", "James", "Rev Shark", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/64f4b86e-651c-11e9-a10a-1dedd3db1a9a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
