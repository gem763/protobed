Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, as nefarious.\n\n\u201cThink about the harm that could come from the disclosure of such information,\u201d Mr. Arthur wrote in a memo questioning the reason for the language. \u201cImagine what would happen if it became public that the Holiday Inn in Yuma houses troops who are supporting [Customs and Border Protection]?\u201d\n\nHe said anti-enforcement activists could organize boycotts of establishments that provide the housing. Worse yet, he speculated, the smuggling cartels use the information to plan their drug and people smuggling activities.\n\n\u201cGood luck with keeping this information under wraps. Congress plainly wants this information to be in the public sphere,\u201d Mr. Arthur said.\n\nThousands of troops were deployed to the border over the last year to help stem the surge of caravans of migrants. They are assisting Customs and Border Protection by manning surveillance cameras, flying air missions and providing logistics support \u2014 though they are not supposed to be engaged in actual enforcement.\n\nThe deployments are as controversial as the rest of Mr. Trump\u2019s border policy, with critics saying it\u2019s stretching the military and creating too much entanglement between the troops and domestic law enforcement.\n\nHouse Democrats sought to push back in their defense bill, which cleared the chamber in July.\n\nThe bill would require the Pentagon to list every deployment, with a justification. It also would require cost estimates and information about what the military units might have been doing had they not been sent to the border.\n\nAnd, in one section, the bill requires \u201ca map indicating the locations where units so deployed are housed.\u201d\n\nMr. Arthur blamed the provision on Rep. Adam Smith, the Washington Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and who has been a critic of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement policies.\n\nMonica Matoush, a spokeswoman for Mr. Smith and Democrats on the House committee, dismissed Mr. Arthur\u2019s speculation.\n\nShe said the Defense Department routinely provides information to Congress about its role at the U.S.-Mexico border, and the new provision \u201cformalizes\u201d that exchange.\n\nShe said it became clear in some of those recent exchanges that lawmakers wanted even more specific information on troop deployments.\n\n\u201cWith the increase of active duty military personnel at the border, Congress revised its information requirement in line with the increased requirements for support to better understand any potential effects on readiness and the associated financial implications,\u201d Ms. Matoush said.\n\nMr. Smith is negotiating with Senate Republicans over a final compromise. The Senate bill does not contain the stringent reporting requirement.\n\nThe defense policy bill is considered Congress\u2019s one must-pass piece of policy legislation, and a version has cleared every year for nearly six decades.\n\nBut this year is proving tougher than most, and Mr. Smith says Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall is the biggest sticking point.\n\nDemocrats are still smarting over Mr. Trump\u2019s move this year to go around Congress and funnel extra money to wall building, culling it from the Pentagon\u2019s budget.\n\nMr. Smith said any bill that doesn\u2019t curtail the president\u2019s wall-building money would have a tough time passing the House.\n\nMs. Matoush said there are \u201cno final decisions\u201d on whether Mr. Smith will demand the reporting requirements be included in whatever final compromise the House and Senate do reach.\n\nThe office of Rep. Mac Thornberry, the top House Republican negotiating the final defense bill compromise, declined to comment citing the ongoing negotiations.\n\nSenate Republicans\u2019 top negotiator is Senate Armed Services Chairman James Inhofe of Oklahoma. His office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
