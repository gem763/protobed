According to the publication, these include encouraging, enabling, instructing or persuading a child to perform a sexual act; compelled self-sexual assault; sexual grooming of children; and possession of child pornography.\n\nNews24 in September last year reported on the man's arrest on the church premises after he was reported to police by the parents of one of his alleged victims. The child was 14 years old.\n\nThe youth leader allegedly pretended to be a girl and exchanged naked photos with the boys via social media.\n\nPolice after his arrest said the suspect threatened the boys with \"online exposure\" when they decided to stop sending photos.\n\nThe children would seek advice from him on how to handle the online bullying, and the youth leader would advise them to continue doing what the individual wanted, SAPS said at the time.\n\nThe police's Serial and Electronic Crimes Investigation section of the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit arrested the pastor following a joint investigation with the Hawks and the US's Homeland Security.\n\nAuthorities also seized several electronic items including cellphones, a laptop, a tablet and memory cards.\n\nSix months later, while out on R1 000 bail, he was again arrested, this time for charges related to the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act.\n\nThe man cannot be identified as his plea has not yet been heard and accepted in court.\n\n- Compiled by Tammy Petersen", "description": "A Rondebosch youth leader facing 47 sex abuse charges could face a 10-year prison sentence if a plea bargain he agreed to with the State on Friday is accepted by the Wynberg Magistrate\u2019s Court, a weekend report says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9418/f2b5350308c74c6bb650fbfd96785bcb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
