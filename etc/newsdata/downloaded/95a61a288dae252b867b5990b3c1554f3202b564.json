The photo received lots of buzz after his mom posted it on Microbe World.\n\nTasha Sturm, who worked as a microbiology lab tech at Cabrillo College in Aptos, California, was used to seeing students swab objects like cell phones and door knobs for germs as part of basic experiments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s partly to show that there are microbes everywhere,\u201d Sturm told TODAY in 2015, noting her two kids enjoyed replicating some of the tests at home and that her son had been particularly interested in checking out what was on his hands.\n\nThe 8-year-old boy had been playing outside before he pressed his hand into the Petri dish.

When the boy came back in, she had an agar plate \u2014 a sterile Petri dish filled with a substance used to grow bacteria \u2014 ready. After he gently put his hand onto the plate, Sturm incubated the dish at body temperature for a day or so and then let it sit out at room temperature.\n\nBy the time she took the photo, the bacteria had been growing for about a week. Her son\u2019s reaction to the results?\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018that\u2019s cool.\u2019 And then my daughter said, 'Let\u2019s do the dog\u2019s nose, let\u2019s do the paw, let\u2019s do the cat\u2019s tail,'\u201d Sturm recalled.\n\nThis is a close-up of the round blob in the lower right corner of the original photo. Courtesy Tasha Sturm/Cabrillo College/asm.org\n\nSturm believed the large white circle in the bottom right of the photo was Bacillus, which is commonly found in dirt. Some of the other white spots may be staph, or Staphylococcus, she said, while the yellow and orange spots may be yeast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal stuff that we\u2019re exposed to every day. The skin protects us from a lot of the bad stuff out there,\u201d Sturm said. \u201cThe take home message is that to have a healthy immune system, you\u2019ve got to be exposed to stuff.\u201d\n\nIndeed, environments that are extremely clean may make children more sensitive to allergens, according to the \u201chygiene hypothesis.\u201d\n\nBoth of Sturm\u2019s kids knew that if they wanted to pet the dog or play outside, they needed to wash their hands before eating. It\u2019s just basic hygiene, she said.\n\nFollow A.
