And now they\u2019re coming for Qantas.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday morning \u2013 both video and text screenshots \u2013 the Aussie pop duo brought the drama that has followed them since they were asked to leave a flight on Sunday into yet another day.\n\nStatements, photographs, and quotes from witnesses claiming to have also be on the plane flooded The Veronicas social media pages around 11:30am.\n\nOne tweet includes a photograph of a Qantas employee, claiming he had switched over his identification badge before speaking to them, and another of the law requirements for Aviation Security ID Cards.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we would like to mention for anyone, but especially our young fans reading about this incident, is that you are alway within your rights to stand up against bullies who try to silence you,\u201d read a screenshot from the sisters, which also announced that the band would be donating to Bullyzero.org.\n\nA bit confused and need a catch up? The story goes like this:\n\nA few days ago the pop icons were booted off of a flight from Sydney to Brisbane by the Australian Federal Police after allegedly failing to comply with cabin crews\u2019 directions.\n\nThe sisters were escorted off of the plane on Sunday morning, reportedly after a fight broke out between them and cabin crew. Which is a big no-no as far as \u201cthings to do on planes\u201d goes.\n\nLater in the day the singers (real names Lisa and Jess Origliasso) wrote in an Instagram comment that it was an \u201cupsetting and embarrassing experience\u201d which they were mostly clueless for throughout.\n\nimagine calling the AFP on the veronicas \u2014 Tiger Webb (@tfswebb) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cWe actually already had our bag up in the overhead,\u201d read the comment. \u201cThe female flight attendant wanted Lisa\u2019s bag spun around. Lisa asked the attendant if she could help assist her, because she couldn\u2019t reach it (we\u2019re only 5\u201d1). The attendant said it was against company policy. And a lovely man behind us helped instead,\u201d Jess said on the shared account. \u201cThen right before take off, the flight attendant bought over the manger and pointed us out. He proceeded to lecture us about company policy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all a bit he-said, she-said, and some people claiming to have also been on the flight have taken to social media to give their side of the story.\n\nI was actually on this flight and there was nothing belligerent about the sisters. The QANTAS crew decided they wanted to flex their muscles & were totally over the top. Funny thing is while they were explaining \u201cPolicy\u201d other members of the crew were moving other peoples bags \u2014 Matt Day (@idiomatically) September 22, 2019\n\nAfter their plane removal made headlines The Veronicas appeared on The Project and faced a stern grilling from host Waleed Aly, denying they caused the incident for publicity.\n\n\u201cThis is a legal matter, not a publicity stunt,\u201d said Jess.\n\nWhen pressed by Aly as to why The Project had only been sent edited footage from onboard the plane, both told the host they couldn\u2019t share unedited footage because it could impact their legal action.\n\nThe Veronicas\u2019 final tweet as of writing included a voice recording from someone allegedly on the plane. \u201cI was literally in the seat right in front of you,\u201d says the man.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t go too far, you didn\u2019t raise your voice.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1154928948.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
