Source: Twitter, @MichellePhan\n\nAfter leaving YouTube at the height of her channel in 2015, one of YouTube\u2019s earliest creators and most famous beauty stars, Michelle Phan, picked up cryptocurrencies as one of her most stimulating interests, finding her discovery of Bitcoin more exciting than that of YouTube.\n\nFeeling burnt-out, but also thinking that she'd accomplished all that she wanted to on YouTube since she started her beauty channel in 2007, the 32-year-old American makeup artist, entrepreneur, author, and voice actress decided that the highest point of the channel was the best to walk away, she told The Cut.\n\nWhile Phan still has an interest in beauty and plans to pursue it, she has also turned to other things she finds appealing, one of which is cryptocurrency. She said in the recent interview that she needs spontaneity not to become bored, and crypto and blockchain seems to be the place for her. \u201cI\u2019m actually more excited about Bitcoin than I was when I first discovered YouTube,\u201d Phan says.\n\nAs to what drew her to the Cryptoverse, she says: \u201cI am a lover of decentralization. [\u2026] YouTube is decentralized, in the sense that anyone can have a channel, have their own network, and make their own content.\u201d She further draws comparisons, explaining that Bitcoin is \u201cnot run by any higher authority power. It\u2019s not a company. There are no board members. For the first time in history, you can be your own bank. We\u2019ve never had that before.\u201d\n\nThat is why she has been buying BTC in the past few years, believing that all entrepreneurs should make this \u201cprobably the most important investment you can ever make in your life.\u201d Phan believes buying products and services with crypto is only going to get easier, saying that the situation now with cryptocurrencies is what it was with the Internet back in its infancy days. \u201cRemember when there was only internet cafes? And now we have the internet on our phones.\u201d\n\n10 years ago, I was ridiculed for quitting my job to pursue my YouTube channel. No one saw the potential in the platform like I did.\n\n\n\nYears later, I was ridiculed again for investing in BTC and ETH.\n\n\n\nI like having the last laugh \ud83d\ude42 \u2014 \u2133 (@MichellePhan) August 19, 2018\n\nBitcoin was created with the intent to create a better money with the tools we have today. The monetary theory behind BTC is what makes it valuable. Learn about what money is, and you\u2019ll understand why BTC is important. Good luck hodlers. pic.twitter.com/SzJFd4wWvL \u2014 \u2133 (@MichellePhan) June 22, 2019\n\nAdditionally, Phan invested in a cryptocurrency gaming company Quarters, and also discussed BTC on podcasts, including the one in September with the U.S. 2020 presidential candidate, Andrew Yang, as a guest.\n\nAt pixel time (12:23 AM UTC), bitcoin trades at c. USD 8,86. It's almost unchanged in the past 24 hours and down by 2% in the past seven days.", "description": "After leaving YouTube at the height of her channel in 2015, one of YouTube\u2019s earliest creators and most famous beauty stars, Michelle Phan, picked up cryptocurrencies as one of her most stimulating interests, finding her discovery of Bitcoin more exciting than that of YouTube.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/5e9a45a86b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
