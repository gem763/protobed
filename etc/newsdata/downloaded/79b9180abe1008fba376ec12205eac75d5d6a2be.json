While the larger black-listed companies, Hikvision and Dahua Technology, manufacture video surveillance products.\n\nThe black-listing of these technology companies - as well as the voice recognition company iFlytek - comes as China has attracted international criticism for constructing detention camps and an advanced surveillance system for Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.\n\nBeijing denies any mistreatment at the camps, which it says provide vocational training to help stamp out religious extremism and teach new work skills.\n\nA Megvii spokesman said the US decision to ban the company was made \u201cwithout any factual basis\u201d. The spokesman said Megvii did not generate revenue from projects in Xinjiang in the first half of 2019, and the region accounted for only 1 per cent of its sales in 2018, according to The Financial Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMegvii added in a statement to Reuters that a May 2019 report from Human Rights Watch on a surveillance app in Xinjiang had implicated Megvii\u2019s Face++, but in a corrected and reissued report, HRW did not highlight Megvii\u2019s name.\n\nThis black-listing of Chinese technology companies and government organisations comes amid a simmering US-China trade war and an artificial intelligence arms race that both countries are desperate to win.\n\nIn May, the Trump administration added Huawei to the black-list, restricting the Chinese telecom equipment maker from buying hardware, software and services from American suppliers.\n\nThe US administration labelled Huawei a security threat, saying the Chinese government could tap into Huawei equipment installed overseas to spy on the West or disrupt infrastructure \u2013 allegations Huawei denies.\n\nEarlier this week, officials in the US government suggested issuing credit to companies such as Nokia and Ericsson to compete against Huawei - part of a wider push to cultivate a rival to the Chinese company.", "description": "A Macquarie bank backed Chinese artificial intelligence start-up has been black-listed by the Trump administration over concerns about its role in human rights violations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0192%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7394feee8394be10d8cc8917cc12ebe91eba9870", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
