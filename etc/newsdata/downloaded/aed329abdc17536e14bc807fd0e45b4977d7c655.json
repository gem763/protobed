So the grand tiger (voiced by Helen McCrory) that keeps faithful to Asriel is actually there, and absolutely stunning.\n\nThe world as everyone knows it is about to change forever (Picture: BBC)\n\nMeanwhile, James McAvoy as the somewhat embittered man with a plan is a complicated character you can\u2019t help but dislike but want to know more about. His fight for the discovery of a mysterious substance called Dust is enough to bring the intrigue while also making his behaviour towards an ever-doting Lyra a little heartbreaking.\n\nFirst coming to prominence in Wolverine\u2019s final bow Logan, Dafne Keen is a force to be reckoned with for such a young actress, and her headstrong nature as Lyra makes her an instant heroine for young children to emulate and look up to as she heads off into a new world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis Dark Materials is a magical mystery world that we haven\u2019t seen before in such intricate detail since the Harry Potter franchise (though Lord knows people have tried) \u2013 and that\u2019s in part down to the special effects that keeps manages to balance the real world we know to the false one created for the series.\n\nIt\u2019s both old and new realities, with blimps instead of planes and technology almost entire absent, but a modern sensibility running through the characters.\n\nThe story also does the important thing of making it feel adult enough to neither bore parents nor talk down to kids who could watch it.\n\nMore: TV Reviews Dirty Dancing is the feminist manifesto we all need The OC wasn't just a teen drama - it made being an outsider cool The Politician season 1 review: Ryan Murphy's camp and electric satire gets our vote\n\nFans of the original books will not be disappointed, with a faithful recreation we\u2019ve been looking to see since we were first brought into the world back in 1995.\n\nWe have high hopes for the eight-episode series (and the second that is already in production) that will sail us through to the end of the year in style.\n\nHis Dark Materials starts Sunday 3 November on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
