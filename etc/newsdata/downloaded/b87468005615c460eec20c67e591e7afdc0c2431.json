The regulations forced some of this stuff, and the less liquid end of the equity market got treated poorly.\" Concannon said. \"What is nice about the fixed-income market, it is going to be a patient walk to a more electronic market.\"\n\nRead more: Wall Street banks have seen electronic trading chip away at their control of the corporate bond market. Now they're fighting back.\n\nOne area bond investors should look at how stocks are traded is the concept of working an order, or putting a buy or sell order out into the market and handling it over time across multiple counterparties.\n\nAs it stands now, Concannon said, investors either work with one dealer to handle large, block orders or trade small tickets as quickly as possible to get them off their trading desk.\n\n\"The concept of working orders still hasn't reached the fixed-income market,\" Concannon said. \"I think there will be a lot of evolution around how clients can put some orders in the machine and work the larger, more complex orders.\"\n\nInnovations like that, or around how investors price bonds, are areas where the bond market can see big benefits from taking inspiration from how equities trade, Concannon said.\n\n\"Investors would save billions,\" he added.\n\nSee more: The opaque bond market could be the next frontier for the booming alternative-data business that's on track to grow to $7 billion\n\nHowever, Concannon said some parts of the bond market should remain the same, instead of following in the footsteps of the stock market. RFQ, or the process of requesting a price from a dealer, will continue to be how a majority of trading takes place, he added.\n\nBonds that don't trade frequently, of which there are many, shouldn't be required to be widely displayed as it will make them more difficult to trade, Concannon said.\n\nMaintaining a range of trading protocols, and giving investors choice, will be key as the market changes, Concannon said.\n\nBut there is no doubt that change is coming, he added.\n\n\"There are a lot of people in the community that just don't get. They just don't know it's happening,\" Concannon said. \"They're convinced that there are too many CUSIPs, so we can't have electronic trading. That is just not the case.\"", "description": "Chris Concannon, MarketAxess's COO, spoke about what type of innovation he'd like to see come to bond trading.", "authors": ["Dan Defrancesco"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d962833625ac924a32238cb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
