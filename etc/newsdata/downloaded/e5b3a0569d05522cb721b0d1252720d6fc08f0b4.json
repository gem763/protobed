Its review could answer \"why the fuel release was not detected before ignition, why the release was not isolated, and why prolonged emergency response efforts were necessary to control and ultimately extinguish the fire,\" according to an initial report released on Wednesday.\n\nNo injuries were reported from fire.\n\nThe CSB investigates chemical plant explosions and fires to determine root causes to improve plant safety, but has no regulatory or enforcement power.\n\nMitsui faces criminal charges for spilling chemicals into waterways around the ITC terminal in the Houston suburb of Deer Park, Texas, after the fire was put out.\n\nVopak, which operates a storage terminal adjacent to ITC, sued in May for at least $1 million in lost business and damages.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Tom Brown)", "description": "The fire that began on March 17 at Intercontinental Terminals Co (ITC) spread black smoke across Houston, shut the ship channel, slowed production at local oil refineries and closed roadways and schools as it spread from one giant storage tank to 10 others before being extinguished on March 20.  \"", "authors": ["Erwin Seba"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FM_AUixdTzSfsUQubp38vg--~B/aD01MzM7dz03OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/2f5aca77aff6f6d702ee10aed137e15e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
