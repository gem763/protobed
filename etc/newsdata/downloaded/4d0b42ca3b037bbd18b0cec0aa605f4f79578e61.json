From there, Steve Doocy asked Napolitano if he thought the Ukraine scandal was a result of \u201ccoordination\u201d between Democrats, the intelligence community, and the whistleblower who filed the complaint against Trump.\n\nNapolitano went on from there by dissecting the recent confusion surrounding efforts in recent years to change the rules on whistleblower reports. The president\u2019s allies have used that to try and defend him in recent days, even though Napolitano noted that \u201cCongress rejected\u201d the rule change effort.\n\nEventually, Ainsley Earhardt asked \u201cWhat happens with Joe Biden and his son? Are they going to open that up investigation on both of them?\u201d Napolitano answered that even though Rudy Giuliani claims to have evidence against the Bidens, \u201cprosecutors in Ukraine and even prosecutors here in the United States say there\u2019s no there there.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Mediaite.Com Tv Napolitano-Debunks-Biden-Ukraine-Conspiracy-Theories-On-Fox-Friends-No-There-There"], "top_image": ""}
