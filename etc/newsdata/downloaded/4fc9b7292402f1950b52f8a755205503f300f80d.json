Of those that use mobile banking, 82% said mobile was their primary banking channel and 62% said they would even change banks if the mobile banking experience fell short.\n\nIn response, digital teams at high-street banks like Lloyds, Halifax, and Bank of Scotland are placing mobile channels at the heart of their digital transformation initiatives: \"Technology is at the centre of our strategy...we are constantly developing new mobile banking features to help our customers stay connected to their finances,\" according to Zak Mian, Group Digital and Transformation Director at Lloyds Banking Group.\n\nIn the UK Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Report, we take a deep dive into this trend by benchmarking the largest 10 financial institutions offering zero-fee current accounts in the UK on whether they offer the mobile features that customers say they care most about.\n\nThis 63-page report draws on two exclusive data sources: a benchmark of the 10 largest UK financial institutions by 33 features and a UK consumer study on the desirability of each of those features. This research gives digital teams a data-driven look into which highly in-demand features, like card controls, they should focus their attention on. On the other hand, it also spotlights which features should be deprioritized, by showing that voice banking has minimal consumer demand, for instance.\n\nHere are a few key takeaways from the report:\n\nLloyds has the most desirable mobile banking feature set in the UK. The bank offers in-demand security, and transfer features, along with competitive capabilities related to account access, conversational banking, and account management. Barclays took second place and Nationwide rounded out the top three.\n\nSecurity features were the number one priority for consumers. For example, our study's single most in-demand feature - the ability to order a replacement card in-app - fell under this category, while the ability to put a temporary hold on a credit or debit card was also among the survey's top five features, out of a list of 33.\n\nFeatures tied to accessing bank accounts are also highly sought-after. This section includes capabilities that enable frictionless access to users' accounts in mobile banking. To differentiate themselves, banks can look to offer features beyond the commonly supported biometric login options, such as a four- to six-digit passcode login and the ability to see accounts at other banks in one portal.\n\nDigital money management features are sought-after by the UK mobile banking users in our study. This section includes features that help users cut spending and grow savings, including the abilities to view recurring charges and spending within specific date ranges. The ability to cancel subscriptions, such as for Netflix, was called \"extremely valuable\" by 30% of respondents and was the section's most in-demand feature.\n\nConversational banking capabilities are not a priority for consumers. Four out of five lowest in demand features fell into the category.", "description": "Business Insider Intelligence's first annual UK Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study shows 72% of all UK respondents use mobile banking.", "authors": ["Eleni Digalaki"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a45102e22af147e01f2e2-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
