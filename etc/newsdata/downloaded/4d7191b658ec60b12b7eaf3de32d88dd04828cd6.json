They show those commercials selling that idea that real men eat meat. But you\u2019ve got to understand that\u2019s marketing. That\u2019s not based on reality.\u2019\n\nLewis, who also sat down for the film, adds: \u2018We all wanna look great, have more energy.\u2019\n\nOne viewer shared on Twitter: \u2018Just watched #TheGameChangers on Netflix. Watching this, and living with Vegan, has changed my perspective and I will be changing over to a plant based diet. If any one has any recipes send them my way.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u201cA gorilla will F*** you up in two seconds, and what does a gorilla eat?\u201d #TheGameChangers : a brilliant documentary! #veganlife,\u2019 read another tweet.\n\nLewis Hamilton also talks about how he stays fit (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018It might be the best #Vegan documentary yet,\u2019 one enthusaistic viewer commented, while another tweeted out: \u2018If you have ever asked a vegan or vegetarian where they get their protein it is your civic duty to watch #TheGameChangers.\u2019\n\nDoctors have also praised the programme as \u2018a big eye-opener\u2019, and recommended it for \u2018anyone who is an athlete\u2019 (pretty sure that\u2019s us out, then\u2026).\n\nDr. Andrew Little from Doctors For Nutrition said: \u2018Do yourself a favor and watch this documentary.
