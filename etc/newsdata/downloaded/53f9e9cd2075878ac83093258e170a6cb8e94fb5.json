It\u2019s weird, too, because I wrote this song over a year ago, and it\u2019s like I feel completely different from when I wrote it. It\u2019s such an interesting feeling.\u201d\n\nHAILEY BALDWIN SNAPS AT TROLLS SAYING SHE'S 'SECOND BEST' TO SELENA GOMEZ\n\nGomez told Seacrest she can recall exactly where she was and how she felt at the time when she wrote the song.\n\n\u201cIt's more beautiful for me because I know exactly where I was when I wrote it and how I felt,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIt would have been too hard to release it when it was written. Now it's fun, I am smiling. It's all the feelings, right? It's everything from happy to emotional, to realizing it and being frustrated. I wanted to validate all those feelings.\u201d\n\nGomez said she wanted to \u201cexpress exactly what I felt,\u201d and said that she has been truthful with herself and with fans about the heartbreak she endured -- so waiting longer than she initially planned actually turned her sorrow into art.\n\nSELENA GOMEZ DEFENDS HAILEY BALDWIN, DEBUTS NEW SINGLE 'LOOK AT HER NOW'\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why I\u2019ve waited this long to express what I\u2019ve felt,\" Gomez said. \"I\u2019m always going to be honest with people. I\u2019ve never not been. I might not be overly chatty about it all the time, but this is where I\u2019m able to release it. This is where it turns into art.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt actually shocks me,\u201d Gomez said of the reaction she received since dropping her new singles. \u201cBecause everyone writes about something they felt and the biggest topic is love, and, in a way, it\u2019s not something negative. It\u2019s actually something positive that I was able to experience that was as beautiful and ugly as it was.\u201d\n\nSELENA GOMEZ EXPLAINS INCLUDING 'IN 2 MONTHS, YOU REPLACED US' LYRIC IN 'LOSE YOU TO LOVE ME' SINGLE\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful I\u2019ve been able to turn this into a new chapter,\" she added.\n\nWhen probed about how she feels seeing her ex as a married man, the \u201cWolves\u201d singer said she\u2019s focused on herself and her career, but knows there are people out there in the world who have similar experiences. Gomez said she needed to address her feelings simply to be able to move past it all.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I\u2019m really grateful, too, because I\u2019ve actually experienced that a million times before and that\u2019s the unfortunate part about what I do,\" she said. \"It\u2019s all very real to me, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just entertainment for other people. But I think I had become numb to it and it would be stupid of me if I didn\u2019t acknowledge what I had felt because it would be inauthentic, and that\u2019s everything I claim to be and do.\"\n\nThe Puma signee added: \"I know there are thousands of people who have felt this feeling and it\u2019s extremely real, and on top of the social media and everything, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in my position or someone else\u2019s because you\u2019re always going to somehow find this negative space, and that\u2019s why I have to be careful and I just have to take steps back and just focus on what I\u2019m doing and nobody else.\"", "description": "Selena Gomez is opening up in a big way about her feelings after releasing two new singles this week suggesting she was harboring some lingering emotions towards her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Baldwin-Bieber-Gomez.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
