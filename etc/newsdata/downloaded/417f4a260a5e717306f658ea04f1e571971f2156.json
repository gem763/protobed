With its embroidered flowers and vegetation in silk, silver and gold, Lynn says she had never seen such high-quality stitching from the 16th century \u2014 meaning that only one person could have worn the material.\n\n\"At the time that this dress dates from, Elizabeth was nearing 70 years old and, in fact, she guarded, very jealously, all the finest fabrics and dresses for herself,\" Lynn said.\n\nA close-up of the Bacton altar cloth.

Much of her clothing burned during the Great Fire of London of 1666 in a royal storehouse.\n\n\"The fact that this has survived really makes it a unique piece and a fantastic window into the past,\" Lynn said.\n\nThe dress likely made its way to the village of Bacton because it was the birthplace of Blanche Parry, Elizabeth I's first lady of the bedchamber, Lynn said. Parry was beloved by Elizabeth I and received many gifts from her.\n\nThe altar cloth survived centuries due to the care it received as a sacred object by the parishioners.\n\nWhen Lynn told the church that their cloth was formerly a dress worn by Elizabeth I, \"their faces went slightly white,\" she said.\n\n\"They always knew that their cloth was special. Local tradition had that it was associated somehow with Blanche Parry and with the court of Elizabeth I,\" she said.\n\n\"But they thought that \u2026 Hampton Court Palace was full of things like this. They didn't realize how rare it was.\"\n\nLynn said that \"they were very pleased\" about the treasure and were happy to let the conservators borrow and work on the cloth. A replica currently hangs in the church.\n\nA 'labour of love'\n\nAlthough the cloth was in good condition, a thousand hours of research and restoration were still required. The canvas backing was starting to pull and tear at the silk.\n\n\"We removed the canvas and carefully stitched it onto a new special silk backing,\" Lynn said.\n\n\"But the stitching was done with a monofilament thread, which is roughly the same sort of dimensions as a human hair and done with surgical needles.\n\n\"So you can imagine that doing that very carefully and precisely took a very long time.\"\n\nThis altar cloth is a key piece in a new exhibit at Hampton Court Palace called The Lost Dress of Elizabeth I. (Historic Royal Palaces/David Jensen/St Faith\u2019s Church Bacton)\n\nThe thread dyes were also telling of trade at the time \u2014 Mexican cochineal red, indicating evidence of some of the first luxury commodities being traded across the Atlantic, and Indian indigo that travelled via Portugal.\n\n\"At a point in the conservation \u2026 we removed the backing and saw the unfaded colours on the back for the first time, and that was really quite incredible because they were really vibrant \u2014 almost neon kind of yellows and greens,\" she said.\n\nTo conservators, the work has been a \"real labour of love.\"\n\n\"They've actually now spent as much time conserving it as the original embroiders took to make it in the first place,\" she said. \"We've now become a part of its history as well.\"\n\nIn its case at a palace where Elizabeth I once walked the hallways, the cloth's threads sparkle and glitter in the lights.\n\n\"To think about how that must have looked, being worn at court 400 years ago with the silver sort of glistening in the light, wearing this kind of fantastically embroidered cloth of silver,\" Lynn said.\n\n\"You'd have been in no doubt that you were looking at the Queen.\"\n\nWritten by Chelsey Gould.
