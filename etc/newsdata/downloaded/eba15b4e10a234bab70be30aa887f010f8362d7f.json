We all know about how The New York Times totally ate it over its botched story about Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The writers claim there was another accuser who alleged, like Deborah Ramirez, that the young future Supreme Court jurist shoved his genitals in another woman\u2019s face at a drunken party at Yale. The problem: the woman doesn\u2019t remember the event, but somehow that lends credibility to Ramirez\u2019s account. It doesn\u2019t. Sorry\u2014that\u2019s not how this works. The Times edited the op-ed piece, added that portion that totally renders the new allegation/bombshell story worthless, and these two women decided to blame the editors. They swear that this portion was included\u2014trust them, right?\n\nSorry, let me rewind, the two writers\u2014Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly\u2014decided to strike one for the sisterhood of the traveling pants and write an anti-Kavanaugh book that sought to prove all the allegations lobbed against the judge during one of the nastiest Supreme Court confirmation fights in recent memory. They didn\u2019t find anything new. It\u2019s just another tantrum book thrown out there by mad liberal upset that Trump is president, that he\u2019s changing the judiciary, and that the GOP didn\u2019t cave to their whims on Kavanaugh. We won. We get to decide who get on the court, not you. And Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was the ultimate \u2018shove it\u2019 moment. We got our revenge for Bork. Period.\n\nYet, while these two writers told MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell that the denial from the alleged new accuser was included in the piece, they left this part out when they were interviewed by National Public Radio. The Federalist\u2019s Mollie Hemingway wrote about it [emphasis mine]:\n\n\u2026in a lengthy and wide-ranging interview, the authors went out of their way to omit the key detail in response to a question. Midway through the friendly interview with NPR\u2019s Terry Gross, she asked the authors if any other women had come forward since the Kavanaugh hearing. Keep in mind the context. The authors spent a year desperately trying to dig up dirt on Kavanaugh and evidence in support of the claims made by his accusers. They failed on both counts, and at times admitted it, but in the epilogue they wrote that their \u201cgut\u201d told them to believe the accusers despite any evidence. They said the stories \u201cring true,\u201d though they did not explain why they felt that way. It\u2019s a stunning admission that emotions dominated facts for the reporters, which is also evidenced by their decision not to release an excerpt about Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s star witness Leland Keyser telling them on the record that her friend\u2019s story never made sense and didn\u2019t add up. Keyser\u2019s views were previously reported in detail in \u201cJustice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court\u201d (co-authored by this writer), but the new book has the first on-the-record quotes from Keyser saying why she found Ford\u2019s story so difficult to believe.\n\nYeah, \u2018Believe All Women\u2019 just got skinned alive. It may sound great, but underneath it all\u2014it\u2019s trash. Sorry, in this country, there is due process. There is investigative work. There is a collection of evidence. At times, it takes a bit of work. Wanting that apparently makes you an ally to rape culture or a rape apologist. No, it makes you one that stands for the rule of law and truth. And that was another garbage point that gets tossed out there regarding Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh\u2019s first accuser, and her allies who would say \u201cher truth\u201d when defending her shoddy claims that she was sexually assaulted by a young Kavanaugh in high school. Ford's motives appear to be really grounded in protecting abortion rights, as told by her lawyer. This whole circus has been exposed. It\u2019s a farce. It\u2019s a really, really well-funded and well-coordinated character assassination attempt. I will give the Left that\u2014but it\u2019s all gossip, no facts, with no corroborating witnesses. The media goes off half-cocked when it comes to stories like these, and like Plaxico Burress, they get shot in the left every time. The Duke Lacrosse scandal ruined people\u2019s lives for no reason\u2014no rape occurred. Those boys were falsely accused. And the accuser turned out to be a real model citizen\u2014said by no one. She\u2019s serving a lengthy sentence for murder after stabbing her boyfriend in 2013.\n\nWe live in a country where there is a presumption of innocence, which is applied to those accused of every crime, but not sexual assault for some reason. There is no room in this discussion to say that those making the accusations could be misremembering or flat-out lying. Yes, women lie about being raped. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. Key details could be missing. And when you have allegations lobbed at Kavanaugh that have more holes in them than a piece of swiss cheese, it should give you pause. Due process is due process. It\u2019s a constitutional right, which liberals seem very willing to burn in order to score political points. Very fitting for a movement that lacks principle, honor, and integrity. Oh, and they\u2019ve all become totally insane as well. This latest rake-stepping episode by the Times has butchered this whole \u2018Believe All Women\u2019 nonsense, or at least it should.", "description": ".09/18/2019 19:20:22PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/279/5d155470-c180-43c4-b7b5-ef40121269a4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
