I know for a fact that we have tried to get them involved but the financial thing is a hurdle. We need experience in the team right now and that comes from ex-players.\"\n\nDu Plessis admitted that South Africa had been outplayed in India and acknowledged that the team had lacked mental strength.\n\n\"It was obvious from the way we played the last Test match. We started really well but by being put under pressure for a long period of time through the series, slowly but surely we started playing worse.\"\n\nThe South African captain said losing the toss in all three Tests had made an already difficult task almost impossible.\n\n\"Every Test match they bat first, they score 500, they declare when it's dark, they get three wickets when it's dark and when day three starts you are under pressure. It was like copy and paste in every Test match.\"\n\nHe repeated his call for the toss to be done away with for Test matches.\n\n\"Then away teams will have a better chance. In South Africa I don't mind that, we bat on green tops anyway.\"", "description": "South Africa captain Faf du Plessis says that full-time appointments concerning the national team's coaching staff and selectors needed to be made urgently.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7908/f4de31072f864ff7b22ddaf888e9d801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
