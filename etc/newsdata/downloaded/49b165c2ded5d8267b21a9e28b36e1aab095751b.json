Right now through Oct. 14, if you buy any Casper mattresses, enter the code DREAMY10 to save 10% on your entire order. This means you can add sheets, pillows, and other sleep accessories and get a discount on the total purchase price.

(Photo: Getty Images / Matc13)\n\nWinter is coming. Some of us have already seen snow! And even if you live in a more temperate part of the country, the colder months still require layers and warmer clothing. Thankfully, L.L.Bean is running a sale this weekend through Oct. 14 where you can get 20% off outerwear, clothing, and footwear with the code BEAN20. This include the ever-popular Bean Boots, which tend to actually sell out this time of year, so we're\n\nShop the L.L. Bean sale\n\n5. Nordstrom\n\nA Nordstrom sale doesn't happen all that often, so don't miss out. (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nNordstrom is offering up to 70% off a ton of items this weekend, including the eternally popular ASTR lace midi dress (only $45 instead of its typical $80) and items from popular brands like Levi's, BP., Kate Spade, and more. Nordstrom is easily one of the most popular apparel and home decor retailers out there. The high-end look and feel of their selection coupled with the moderate prices make it a sweet spot for many of us, but it's even sweeter when they have a sale, and this may be a smaller one, but definitely worth browsing. If you want even deeper savings, Nordstrom Rack is offering up to 70% off new arrivals. The Rack tends to have much more limited sizing, but it doesn't hurt to look!\n\nShop the Nordstrom sale\n\n6. Home Depot\n\nIf you didn't find what you're looking for at Wayfair, we highly recommend checking out The Home Depot's selection. First did you know Home Depot even sells furniture in the first place? Yep! it's true! And right now you can find savings up to 40% in every room of the home (on select pieces). You might be pleasantly surprised that they've got an impressive selection for every room in the house, and you might find the gem you've been dreaming of!\n\nShop the Home Depot sale\n\n7. Lululemon\n\nThese tried and true athleisure pieces are totally worth the sale price. (Photo: Lululemon)\n\nIf you have always admired other people's Lululemon leggings and workout gear at the gym, but balked at the price tag (same!), this weekend you might be able to find something of theirs at a price you can stomach. They're calling this the \"We Made Too Much\" sale and you can find everything from yoga pants to cozy pullovers to men's polos and pants to accessories all at a decent discount (roughly 20-30%).\n\nShop the Lululemon We Made Too Much sale\n\n8. Helix\n\nHelix (Photo: Helix)\n\nHelix makes the best luxury mattress we've ever tested, and when you hear the word 'luxury' it does mean a higher price tag. But this weekend, you can get one of these decadently comfortable beds for much less. You can save $100 on a mattress with the code 4DAYFLASH100. If you spend $1,250 or more, use the code 4DAYFLASH150 to save $150, and if you spend over $1,750, you can save $200 with the code 4DAYFLASH200. Plus, every purchase includes two of their comfy Dream Pillows.\n\nShop the Helix mattress sale\n\n9. eBags\n\nPacking cubes keep your suitcase neat and tidy.

All you have to do is enter your email to get the discount, and you need to give them that info anyway to get your results, so why not? There are loads of different DNA test kit options out there, but 23andMe is one of the most popular.
