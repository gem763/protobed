But he does have certain gifts, one of which we\u2019re seeing in operation right now. It served him well as a businessman and affects almost every aspect of his presidency: Trump has an almost unfailing internal homing device tuned to the vulnerabilities in people and systems.\n\nThat\u2019s also what\u2019s driving the Ukraine scandal \u2014 and what may help him escape it.\n\nIt comes from a lifetime lived beyond the reaches of rules, norms, accountability and even the law. It comes from Trump\u2019s worldview, in which every interaction between individuals, groups or institutions is zero-sum. He\u2019s going to win and you\u2019re going to lose, and in order to make that happen, he is constantly on the lookout for vulnerabilities he can exploit.\n\nIn Ukraine, Trump found a country that was deeply vulnerable and therefore could be enlisted to help his reelection campaign. Sitting next to Russia, an adversary both highly aggressive and far more powerful, Ukraine needs help from the United States. From the beginning of the Trump administration, the Ukrainians seemed to understand that getting that help required a submission to Trump\u2019s personal interests.\n\nLast May, we learned that Ukraine ceased its cooperation with the special-counsel investigation and suspended its own investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had helped since-deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych loot the country before Yanukovych fled to Russia.\n\nWhy did they do it? \u201cIn every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,\u201d said one Ukainian official. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t spoil relations with the administration.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Ukraine was negotiating the purchase of anti-tank weapons from the United States, which could provide deterrence to a Russian incursion. But the Ukrainians\u2019 need for U.S. support was ongoing, as Trump well knew when he dispatched Rudolph W. Giuliani to pressure them to dig up dirt on Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nBoth Giuliani and Trump have admitted that that\u2019s exactly what they were doing. What\u2019s more, it was earlier reported that \u201cThe current prosecutor general [of Ukraine] later told associates that, during one of the meetings, Mr. Giuliani called Mr. Trump excitedly to brief him on his findings.\u201d This was a project in which the president was intimately involved.\n\nIn other words, at some point Trump realized that Ukraine\u2019s position made it vulnerable; needing U.S. help, it could be enlisted to aid his reelection campaign. But that\u2019s just the beginning.\n\nAs Trump understands as well as anyone, the news media is vulnerable to his manipulation. He can make wild, unfounded accusations about Biden or anyone else, and those accusations will be repeated and spread, with factual corrections left for the 12th paragraph or a fact-check most people won\u2019t read. It\u2019s already becoming clear that much of the news media is going to impose an utterly preposterous false equivalence on this story that will encourage people to think it\u2019s just one more Washington squabble where both sides are on equal moral footing.\n\nTrump also sees the vulnerability of Republicans in Congress. Their constituents have been well instructed that there is no catastrophe worse than Democrats winning an election and no crime that would not be justified in order to prevent that outcome. When you watch some pathetic Republican officeholder struggling to explain away Trump\u2019s misdeeds, it\u2019s not only because he lacks moral courage but also because he knows opposing Trump would be political suicide for him. He has no choice but to acquiesce, and Trump knows it.\n\nAnd Trump understands the vulnerability of the entire system. Not only can norms be broken without consequence, but so can the law itself. Trump can simply refuse to comply with congressional subpoenas and dare Democrats to sue. They might win in court (unless they run up against a compliant Trump-appointed judge), but so what? The process will take months or even years to play out.\n\nAnd if Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence just decides that he\u2019d rather not comply with the law mandating that the whistleblower complaint on Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president be turned over to Congress? Then he won\u2019t.\n\nTrump has come to understand that the system is vulnerable to a president who believes that the law doesn\u2019t apply to him, because many of the mechanisms to restrain him are almost toothless if he decides not to obey. And why wouldn\u2019t he believe that? He got elected with the help of a hostile foreign power, he uses the presidency to enrich himself, he hides his tax returns from public view, and when his opponents say \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!,\u201d he says, \u201cYeah? Watch me.\u201d\n\nSo often in Trump\u2019s business career, we saw how he identified others\u2019 vulnerability and exploited it. He would contract with small-business owners, then once they had provided their goods and services, he\u2019d simply refuse to pay them. He did this hundreds of times, knowing that the business owners were vulnerable because they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for the lawsuits it would take to force him to pay up.\n\nHe knew that the suckers he roped in to scams such as Trump University were vulnerable, made so by their admiration of his celebrity and their own economic desperation. He knew that the undocumented workers he employed were vulnerable because of their immigration status. And of course, he knew how vulnerable women are to being sexually assaulted.\n\nA lifetime of breaking rules and laws, and getting away with all of it, has taught Trump that he need not ask \u201cShould I do this?\u201d but instead should ask only \u201cHow can I get away with this?\u201d Again and again, the answer has been to find others\u2019 vulnerability and exploit it. It\u2019s happening again, right in front of our eyes. And it\u2019ll keep happening until we decide to stop it.\n\nRead more:\n\nMax Boot: This may be the worst Trump scandal yet\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: What did Trump tell Ukraine\u2019s president?\n\nGeorge T.
