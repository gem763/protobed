The pair have not been seen this morning.\n\nLast night Mrs Maher said: 'We did own it but sold it 13 months ago.\n\n'It's the cab - my name was down as owning it.'\n\nThey claim they sold it to a company in County Monaghan, close to where truck driver Mo Robinson, 25, lives.\n\nMrs Maher and husband Thomas last night insisted they sold the lorry on October 3 last year. The vehicle was registered in the Bulgarian Black Sea port of Varna (pictured above)\n\nMr Maher said he sold it on 3 October last year. He said the couple owned it for just a year.\n\nThomas said: 'It's disgusting what's happened.\n\n'I went to the British police as we were the registered owners in Bulgaria. I phoned them myself.\n\nThe couple said they sold the lorry to a company near to where Mo Robinson (above) lives\n\n'They were happy we had come forward. They are well aware of who they are dealing with.\n\n'It's not nice to be associated with this. We're shocked.'\n\nThe couple have three children - two boys aged 18 and 11, and a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThey own two Grey Range Rovers - one with a personalised number plate - and a white Chevrolet sports car.\n\nThey purchased their detached modern \u00a3250,000 home in Warrington, Cheshire two years ago.\n\nMrs Maher registered the vehicle at a run down 10-storey building in the seaside resort of Varna.\n\nThe lorry which carried the refrigerated unit holding 39 bodies left the day after it was registered and has never been back to Bulgaria.\n\nBulgarian officials believe that there may be no other connection to the country, other than the PO Box and registration certificate.\n\nOne resident of the number seven building in Varna said: 'There have been many, many companies using that small office for business here.\n\n'It is locked up now. I have never seen anybody there. The letters used to be put up against the wall and somebody would have to come and collect them. It has been secured and is disused.'", "description": "A police car was parked outside the home Joanna and Thomas Maher from 7am today.
