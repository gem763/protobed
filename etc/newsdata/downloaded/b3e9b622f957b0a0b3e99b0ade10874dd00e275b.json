That is by mutual consent, Iguodala agreed to wait it out \u2014 likely until close to the Feb. 6 trade deadline \u2014 while the Grizzlies looked for a trade partner willing to take on the veteran.\n\nAfter the February deadline, if Memphis keeps him, they likely buy Iguodala out. If Memphis trades him, it\u2019s possible that team will buy him out.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIf Iguodala gets bought out, expect him to land in Los Angeles with the Clippers or Lakers, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski said on an ESPN NBA preview show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the two LA teams. It\u2019s the Lakers and it\u2019s the Clippers. If there is a buyout at some point and if Memphis can\u2019t trade him, that\u2019s where that will come down to those two teams\u2026 \u201cIguodala\u2019s fine with seeing what the landscape looks like and then jumping in on the season a little later [during the season].\u201d\n\nIguodala would help either of those teams, he\u2019s still a high-level wing defender for the postseason \u2014 he\u2019s proven that against LeBron James, and in the West perimeter defenders will be at a premium in the postseason \u2014 plus he plays a smart game and can hit big shots. Both the Lakers and Clippers would jump at the chance to have him, but Iguodala has the advantage of sitting back for half the season and seeing which of those teams appeals to him and be a better fit.\n\nStory continues\n\nIguodala ended up in Memphis because the Warriors were making moves to revamp their roster last summer and they needed to clear some cap space. So they traded Andre Iguodala to Memphis and sent the Grizzlies a first-round pick in the deal. Iguodala understood the business side of the trade, but he also doesn\u2019t want to play for the rebuilding Grizzlies. Memphis doesn\u2019t want to buy him out \u2014 unless he\u2019s giving back a healthy chunk of the $17.2 million he is owed, which Iguodala will not do \u2014 instead, the Grizzlies hope to trade him for young players or picks to be part of their rebuilding process. Right now there is no deal to be had, so the two sides reached an agreement and Iguodala is on the roster but not with the team, he\u2019s working out at home while Memphis looks for a trade.\n\nThat could be a while.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely a trade happens before Dec. 15 (the day players signed this summer can be traded), and if any deal is made it likely will be closer to the Feb. 6 trade deadline. A team in the deep West that feels it is a player away may make a move to trade for Iguodala, but more than likely he will be bought out one way or another.\n\nWhen that happens, Iguodala may be on his move to Los Angeles.", "description": "Memphis wants to trade him, but a buyout is possible.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4rFpyO0JMAQmKEpP67lXAA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MTguNzU-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bnHJltKbqx5aU1u38zTzgQ--~B/aD01NzU7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/83d2cf58ff4b1853aa45b1a83477b6a6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
