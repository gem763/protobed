But the global average carbon price is currently only $2 a ton, far below what the planet needs. The challenge is for more countries to adopt one and for them to raise the price,\" the report authors note in a blog post.\n\nThe intrigue: It's not lost on the IMF that countries are hesitant to act unilaterally for fear of hurting domestic industries.\n\nThe report proposes an \"international carbon price floor\" to tackle this, and say that even a floor well below $75 would yield big gains.\n\nA $50 floor for advanced nations in the G20 and $25 for the group's developing economies would cut emissions 100% more than those nations' current pledges under the Paris agreement, the blog post states.\n\nGo deeper: The world needs a massive carbon tax in just 10 years to limit climate change, IMF says (The Washington Post)", "description": "Their new report recommends taxes reach $75 per ton by 2030", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/a93Q7HF37BBD3F_RKqgxt0ehq8Y=/0x0:4021x2262/1920x1080/2019/10/11/1570800228073.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
