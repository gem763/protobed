REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nFrom Monday, environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion is planning to occupy and blockade 12 sites around Westminster in central London, home to parliament and government buildings, as part of a fortnight of international action to demand action on climate change.\n\nThe protest coincides with the run-up to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, scheduled to take place on Oct. 31, with feelings running high between pro and anti-Brexit supporters and concern the tensions could spill over into violence.\n\n\u201cOur intention is London stays open for business throughout this period,\u201d Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave told reporters. Asked how many officers would be deployed, Ephgrave said: \u201cIt\u2019s a significant resource.\u201d\n\nIn April, Extinction Rebellion caused 11 days of major disruption in central London in one of the largest civil disobedience campaigns seen in Britain, which helped push the climate change issue up the political agenda.\n\nAbout 1,100 people were arrested, with some 850 prosecuted and more than 250 so far convicted of offences during the action which brought major routes to a standstill and saw a pink sailboat used to block Oxford Circus in the capital\u2019s major shopping district.\n\nThe activists have promised that this month\u2019s action will be on an even larger scale.\n\n\u201cPart of the intention is to overwhelm our ability in the police service to respond to their protest activity,\u201d Ephgrave said. He warned all those who broke the law, even as part of non-violent civil disobedience, would face action.\n\nThe force was criticised for a slow response to April\u2019s disruption, which cost about 16 million pounds ($20 million) to police, and Ephgrave said they had learned lessons.\n\n\u201cWe need to be agile, we need to be slightly more proactive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to not be caught out. We want to try and be ahead of what\u2019s happening rather than responding to it.\u201d", "description": "London police said on Wednesday they would mobilise thousands of officers to deal with two weeks of planned chaos by climate activists and potential protests over Brexit.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436265935&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9113R"}
