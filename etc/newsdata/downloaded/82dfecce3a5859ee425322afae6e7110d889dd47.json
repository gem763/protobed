Those combinations determine whether two individuals can mate with one another.", "description": "A Paris zoo is showcasing\u00a0a mysterious creature\u00a0dubbed the \"blob\" - a yellowish collection of unicellular organisms called a slime mold that looks like a fungus, but acts like an animal.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5325784.1571404637!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/france-zoo-blob.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
