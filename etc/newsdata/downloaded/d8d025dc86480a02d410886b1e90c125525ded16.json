Social media users, though, accused Jeong of violating her rights, with one asking: \u201cWould a male nominee have been asked this question?\u201d\n\nSouth Korea has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, despite government attempts to encourage couples to have more children by investing billions of dollars in child-rearing subsidies and daycare services.\n\nThe country\u2019s fertility rate \u2013 the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime \u2013 fell to a record low of 0.98 last year, or less than one baby per woman. That rate is far short of the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population.\n\nMany women, however, say they are reluctant to have children, citing the high cost of raising families and a conservative work culture that makes it difficult for parents of young children to balance their jobs with family life.\n\nJeong later apologised for his remarks, claiming that he had only wanted to highlight South Korea\u2019s demographic crisis and had not meant to insult Joh, according to the Korea Herald.\n\nFemale MPs from the ruling Democratic party of Korea said Jeong was unfit to serve in the national assembly. \u201c[He] seems to believe women giving birth and rearing children is the only way for them to contribute to the country,\u201d they said in a statement quoted in the Korea Times. \u201cHe is unqualified to be a lawmaker in today\u2019s society.\u201d\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this report.", "description": "\u2018Failing to fulfil her duty to the nation\u2019 criticism sparks outrage on social media", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e85780a8d5e36f3a164f564450d4372dd9d6a966/853_0_3197_1918/master/3197.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=23948500901c141aef8895de10152297"}
