He realized he was mentally \"finished\" with the game.\n\n\"Most athletes who come to this realization have their 'aha' moment somewhere in private, but Davis' was happening right there on the sideline,\" Meyer wrote. \"He felt scared and vulnerable, and he wasn't sure what to do \u2014 all he knew was that he couldn't return to the field. He needed to get away.\"\n\nDavis left the game, called his brother, Washington Redskins tight end Vernon Davis, and told him he was retiring. Vernon was stunned, asking if Vontae was joking.\n\nHe then called his wife, who was at the game, and said he was retiring. When they met back at their house, Davis told his wife about his decision, saying, \"I feel free like a bird.\" They drank tequila together to celebrate, according to Meyer.\n\nDavis, who made $33 million over his career, according to Spotrac, has remained in shape, but told Meyer he has no plans to pursue a return to football. He has since gotten into business and is opening a wellness spa.\n\nHe told Meyer that people questioned his mental health when he retired midgame, but insisted he was and is fine.\n\n\"Most people, when I did what I did, they thought I was literally going insane or something,\" Davis said. \"But I was actually fine. I was totally fine. And I'm totally fine today.\"", "description": "Vontae Davis said people questioned if he was mentally healthy when he retired from the NFL mid-game, but said he was and is \"totally fine.\"", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d839abf2e22af21f337d08c-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
