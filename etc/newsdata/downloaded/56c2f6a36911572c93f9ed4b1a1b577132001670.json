That arrangement has left Fannie and Freddie with just around $3 billion of capital each, leaving taxpayers exposed to future bailouts.\n\nSome investors had hoped the Treasury would provide a clear recapitalization plan that would allow the mortgage firms to start retaining the majority of their earnings. The report, however, recommends only that the government \"consider permitting\" them to retain more than the $3 billion in capital currently allowed.\n\nA senior Treasury official said a specific recapitalization plan would still have to be carefully negotiated with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which oversees the mortgage giants. Washington insiders say that negotiation could be highly complicated and legally tricky.\n\nFHFA director Mark Calabria, who told Reuters in July he is eager to end the conservatorship by his the end of his five-year term, called the report an \"important step forward\" in a statement.\n\nThe Treasury hopes that parallel to negotiating a capital plan with FHFA, Congress will be spurred to take up broader housing reforms in the coming months. Most importantly, it called for Congress to create an explicit guarantee for the companies' mortgage-backed securities, although Washington housing lobbyists see such action as unlikely in the near term.\n\n\"My preference is to fix the housing finance system through legislation and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues as we move forward,\" U.S. Senator Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate banking committee, said in a statement.\n\nIf Congress fails to create a new guarantee, the Treasury said it would use its existing investment in the companies to continue serving as a backstop, signaling it may be prepared to stand behind the companies indefinitely.\n\nIn March, President Donald Trump asked the Treasury to develop a plan for housing finance reform, wading into one of the most politically fraught, technically challenging, and economically thorny issues in Washington ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nAs the administration digs into the detail, it will have to navigate the concerns of powerful lobby groups representing bankers, realtors, homebuilders, as well consumer advocates and fair lending groups, which could ultimately scuttle its plan.\n\n\"I'm urging the President: Make it easier for working people to buy or rent their homes, not harder,\" said Brown in his statement.", "description": "Trump administration unveils Fannie, Freddie overhaul, urges Congress to act", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8426C_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
