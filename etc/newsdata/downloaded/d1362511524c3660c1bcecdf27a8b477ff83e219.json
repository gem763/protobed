The rumored \u201cburial at sea\u201d was likely a significant departure from the Islamic burial al-Baghdadi would have preferred.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told reporters, \u201cBaghdadi\u2019s remains were transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing, and the disposal of his remains has been done and is complete and was handled appropriately.\u201d\n\nSeveral mainstream media outlets in the United States cited anonymous sources who claimed al-Baghdadi received a burial with \u201creligious rights according to Islamic custom.\u201d This is a somewhat curious declaration because U.S. policy toward ISIS since its rise to prominence during the Obama administration was entirely premised on the Islamic State having nothing to do with Islam, technically making Baghdadi a heretic who should not be afforded religious respect by any actual Muslim.\n\nFurthermore, Islamic burial customs are difficult to reconcile with the grisly manner of Baghdadi\u2019s death, since he reportedly blew himself to pieces with a suicide vest, killing three of his own children in the process and injuring a U.S. military canine.\n\nAs President Donald Trump put it, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t much left\u201d of the ISIS leader, and some of the remains were taken by U.S. forces for forensic study. Some reports stated Baghdadi\u2019s head was recovered largely intact.\n\nIslamic funeral traditions generally call for burial in the earth as quickly as possible after death, as close as possible to the place of demise. Many of the prescriptions for handling the corpse would be difficult or impossible to carry out for a person who killed himself with a suicide vest. The prayers intoned at the time of burial involve imploring Allah to forgive the dead and repeating the Muslim ritual of fealty to Allah, so they would logically have to be delivered by a practicing Muslim, if not necessarily a cleric.\n\nBaghdadi was a Sunni Muslim from Iraq. His real name was Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri. His father was a scholar of Sunni Islam and Baghdadi followed suit. His family claimed to be descended from the same tribe as Mohammed, the founder of Islam, a crucial qualification for Baghdadi to declare himself \u201ccaliph,\u201d the ruler of a pure Islamic kingdom. His pseudonym \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u201d is a callback to the first Islamic caliph after Mohammed, Abu Bakr. The title \u201ccaliph\u201d essentially means \u201csuccessor to Mohammed.\u201d\n\nMohammed is said to have stipulated that he and his successors should be buried where they die, so Baghdadi\u2019s alleged burial at sea would be seen as contrary to that tradition by those who accept the legitimacy of his claim to be a caliph.\n\nFalse claims to the position of caliph are among the worst heresies in most branches of Islam. The legitimacy of an early caliph is the source of the great schism that has violently divided Sunni and Shia Islam for centuries. As it happens, Shiites recently completed the observance of a major holiday commemorating the murder of Mohammed\u2019s grandson by a caliph they consider false.\n\nThe Islamic State enforces a version of strict Salafist Islam that firmly asserts tombs and shrines \u2013 in effect, any structure built over a grave \u2013 are forms of idolatry. ISIS is noted for aggressively desecrating tombs, including those regarded as sacred by other Sunni Muslims, and destroying mosques built over prominent gravesites. Earlier generations of Salafists even went as far as vandalizing shrines built over the graves of Mohammed\u2019s family.\n\nIf this belief was adhered to in Baghdadi\u2019s case, an appropriate burial would have involved internment in the earth close to where he died in a grave with only humble markers and no shrine or mosque built above it. Any U.S. concern about his grave becoming a \u201cshrine\u201d was still valid, however, as Islamic State fanatics would probably treat it as such even if no ostentatious structures were constructed above it.", "description": "The Pentagon confirmed Monday that the Islamic State terror chief's remains were disposed of \"appropriately\" after his suicide.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1184014021-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
