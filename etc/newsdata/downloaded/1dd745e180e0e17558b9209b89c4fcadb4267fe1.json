How long could the profession keep expanding by simply adding more and more kinds of oppression? Surely, at some point, history would actually be fully inclusive. In fact, I was pretty sure that was already the case. By 2009, I published a book with an essay entitled After Inclusiveness, making this point. Fortunately, I had a tenure-track job by the time the book came out. Many in the profession privately admitted I was right, but almost no one would say so in print.\n\nI do remember one conversation with a genial older historian who graciously offered to read my article on men and barbecuing. I was a young PhD student and doing work entirely different from his. I don\u2019t know why he offered, but his comments are telling. He politely told me that the middle bits were good but he could \u201ctake or leave\u201d the parts at either end. That is, he liked the actual research in the paper, where I reconstructed how people talked about men and cooking in postwar Canada. But the part where I wrapped it all up in the ideology expressed by the recent books I\u2019d read, not so much.\n\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t make any changes. How could I? That was the paradigm I was committed to. It was in the introduction and conclusion that I was really hitting the points I wanted to make\u2014that gender was a social construction, that postwar Canadians were anxious about men living domesticated lives in suburbs and being involved as hands-on fathers, and so they used this silly example of men and barbecuing as a way of saying that men weren\u2019t really going to be too involved in cooking, and that when they did so it would be funny, and that of course they were bad at it, and only did it because it was dangerous and reminded them of cavemen days. Here was power at work\u2014admittedly, in a sort of funny way\u2014shoring up differences between men and women.\n\nTo reiterate: The problem was, and is, that I was making it all up.", "description": "", "authors": ["Christopher Dummitt", "Quillette.Com I-Basically-Just-Made-It-Up-Confessions-Of-A-Social-Constructionist"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
