Boeing has already said it would remake the system and provide more information about it in pilot manuals.\n\nThe final report will be released publicly on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jamie Freed in Singapore and Bhargav Acharya in Bengaluru; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Gerry Doyle)", "description": "The newspaper received an advance copy of a final report on the crash of a Lion Air jet that killed all 189 people on board on Oct. 29, 2018.
