I was dropped off on a desert island with nine people I didn\u2019t know, with no food, no clothes except the ones we were wearing, no shoes, no mobile phone, no bra and no mayonnaise. For one month. There were five men and five women: single parents, divorced, married; black, mixed race, white working class, white middle class, Arab, American and one person with a disability.\n\nThere were people I didn\u2019t like and I knew there were people who didn\u2019t like me. The conditions were harsh. We hadn\u2019t eaten for six days and were severely dehydrated and constantly bitten by sandflies and mosquitoes. We were lying in ditches suffering from hypothermia. It wasn\u2019t Glastonbury, it was Vietnam.\n\nGenerally, I did all the fishing while others sat around the fire discussing who had stolen whose trousers\n\nGenerally, I did all the fishing while others sat around the fire discussing who had stolen whose trousers. Some people kept jumping in front of the cameras and not doing anything at all to help. There was one white man who described himself as an alpha male, and appointed himself leader.\n\nThere was tension, resentment and hostility, but no one argued at all. The strong, silent woman\u2019s pragmatic approach is a technique I have used in life to stay alive, and on the island I kept my hatred to myself. We pretended to get on, and as a result we all survived. We faked it till we made it.\n\nSince coming back, we have all become very close friends. We go to weddings and parties, we send each other messages of support and pictures of our newborn children. We realised it was the circumstances under which we were living that caused us to have the feelings that we did, and once those circumstances had gone we were able to like each other, love each other and get on. When we first knew each other, initially we all masked our hatred. We pretended to like each other, but eventually we found we did. The Island was a magnified microcosm of society and of Brexit.\n\nSince 2016, we now know for sure that everybody hates each other. It\u2019s out in the open. In any democracy there is a certain amount of opposition, but that\u2019s not the same as hate. The archbishop of Canterbury said after the referendum, \u201cThe privilege of democracy is to vote \u2026 To have robust and firm discussion. It is not a privilege of democracy to express hatred, to use division as an excuse for prejudice and for hate-filled attacks.\u201d People vote; some win and some lose. But since the referendum we have used democracy as an excuse to express our hatred, and we all lost. Hate has become as popular and competitive as Formula One and baking cakes.\n\nAccording to research by the charity Show Racism the Red Card, 21% of schoolchildren think Muslims are taking over England, while 37% of Britons surveyed by YouGov said they would support a political party that would reduce the number of Muslims in the UK. It doesn\u2019t exactly help when a privileged white male says that veiled Muslim women look like bank robbers and letterboxes and a year later becomes prime minister. It is an endorsement of that hatred.\n\nMeanwhile, Home Office figures show hate crimes in England and Wales rising over the past five years \u2013 with a big increase, it says, since 2016. A few days after the vote for Brexit a friend of mine was abused on the street. She was wearing Asian clothes. A woman came up to her and said, \u201cHaven\u2019t you left yet?\u201d Just days after the referendum? I mean, give us a chance to get out. My friend said, \u201cI was born here\u201d, and this woman said, \u201cWell, change your stupid clothes then.\u201d And this woman was wearing a pink, terry-towelling tracksuit.\n\nAll those people who voted leave because they thought that when they woke up in the morning all the brown people would be gone are going to have the shock of their lives in six months\u2019 time when we\u2019re all still here, Nadiya is all over the TV and there\u2019s still a woman in a hijab reading the news on Channel 4.\n\nIf the government goes on strike, it will be worth it for the LOLs Read more\n\nPeople face challenging times and that causes division. You look around and wonder, \u201cWhy is their life easier than mine? Why have they got what I haven\u2019t? Why are they happy and I\u2019m not?\u201d You get angry, then bitter and eventually hate sets in.\n\nBut there is a way out. The Island made me realise that masking our hatred doesn\u2019t just happen. It requires us to work. Nobody goes through life never feeling anger towards others. We are human and we have these emotions. But what I learned is that if you just keep your hatred to yourself for long enough, you will forget what you hate and why. We don\u2019t have to deny it, we just have to hide it. So how about we all just shut up and pretend that we like each other?\n\n\u2022 Shazia Mirza is a comedian.", "description": "My stint taught me that the secret to a cohesive society is pretending to like each other, says comedian Shazia Mirza", "authors": ["Shazia Mirza"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/979e8bfeb9286d312f83ea149a4ce40d16e4d9ba/40_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bd25e1d4a30cfbd1561a4731d9f65a64", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
