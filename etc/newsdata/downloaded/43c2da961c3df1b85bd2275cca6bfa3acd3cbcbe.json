REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd fell nearly 4% in early trade on Thursday following the resignation of its chairman after the market closed on the previous day.\n\nThe departure of John Slosar was announced less than three weeks after mounting Chinese regulatory scrutiny led to the shock exit of its chief executive, Rupert Hogg.\n\nCathay shares had closed 7.2% higher on Wednesday as the Hong Kong market was lifted by reports of the withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill, which was officially announced after the market closed.\n\nLong-serving Swire Pacific Ltd executive Patrick Healy was appointed as Cathay\u2019s new chairman on Wednesday following the resignation of Slosar, who had served in the role since 2014.\n\n\u201cAs John would have retired soon anyway it\u2019s not really a huge setback as a business,\u201d an analyst said of Slosar\u2019s departure. \u201cHowever it\u2019s always awful to see when politics dictate like this.\u201d\n\nThe analyst, who was not authorised to speak publicly about personnel changes, said he believed if the political situation in Hong Kong stabilised, the situation at Cathay should as well.\n\nDaiwa Capital Markets analyst Kelvin Lau said the extradition bill\u2019s withdrawal was positive for Cathay, even though protests were not expected to end immediately.\n\n\u201cWe expect this to be a turning point where the situation would at least not worsen,\u201d he said in a note to clients, adding that recent personnel changes at the airline should satisfy the requirements of the Chinese regulator and were likely to instill confidence among customers.\n\nChina\u2019s aviation regulator last month said crew who engaged in the anti-government protests in Hong Kong posed a threat to safety and should be suspended from staffing flights to the mainland and over its airspace.", "description": "Shares in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd fell nearly 4% in early trade on Thursday following the resignation of its chairman after the market closed on the previous day.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426379189&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF84065"}
