Tucked away in the gardens is a wooden outbuilding, an ideal play space for young children. Open fields adjoin the gardens, accentuating its rural feel.\n\nStats\n\nThis 4,520-square-foot detached house has four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a reception hall, a kitchen that opens onto a dining room, a double reception room, a further dining room and a cellar.\n\nIt is set in an acre of grounds, with views of trees, open fields and the spire of the village church.\n\nMore: Brussels\u2019s Uccle Has Large Villas and Prestigious Schools\n\nAmenities\n\nA natural swimming pool is enclosed by a low fence, which provides unobstructed views across the lawns.\n\nWith views of a church, and bordered by lawns, the pool is chemical-free and filtered by a bed of reeds in the water.\n\nA wooden hot tub has been built by the pool, and the master bedroom dressing room has an infrared sauna.\n\nThe house has security cameras,alarm systems and automatic gates to the front.\n\nFrom Penta: Profiting From the Wine Experts\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nLocated in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium, \u2018s-Gravenvoeren is a leafy, picturesque village beside the River Voer featuring numerous walkways across the water to the houses.\n\nClose to the Netherlands border, the town is 10 miles north of the Dutch town of Maastricht and 15 miles west of the German city of Aachen.\n\nAgent: Leslie D.T. de Ruiter, managing director of Residence 365, affiliate of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\n\nView the original listing.
