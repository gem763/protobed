All that remains are the throttles.\n\nGetting the plane from Osijek airport, 340 kilometres (211 miles) from the village was a big operation.\n\n\u201cBecause of its exceptional dimensions, a span of 28 metres and a length of 34.5 metres (91 by 113 feet), we had to break it down into several pieces to transport it,\u201d Sedlar said.\n\nIt took six weekends to break down the plane and five days to transport it.\n\n\u201cNow, we reconstruct it, we will repair the damaged parts of the hull, before painting it\u2026 In the cockpit, we will put two flight simulators,\u201d he said.\n\nThe plane enthusiast has set March 8 as the opening date, the same day as his 51st birthday and International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "In the middle of a tiny village in Croatia lies a Fokker-100 plane parked in a local resident's garden, but after 23 years of travelling the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Plane-parties-Fokker-100-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
