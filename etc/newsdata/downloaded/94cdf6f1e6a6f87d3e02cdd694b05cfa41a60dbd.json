The downturn was often attributed to challenging economic conditions, weak demand and subdued client confidence,\" said De Lima.\n\nThe report highlighted that business sentiment strengthened to a four-month high, but remained subdued by historical standards. Those firms that were optimistic cited upbeat projections for sales, exports, investment, advertising and new product launches.\n\nA sub-index measuring output slipped to 47.7 from 48.6 the previous month, dipping to its lowest level on record.\n\nSome of the decisions made by Lopez Obrador, a leftist proponent of economic nationalism, have shaken investor confidence in Mexico, dampening hopes for growth.\n\nConfidence in Mexico also was rattled at the end of May when President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports to the United States if Mexico did not curb the flow of U.S.-bound migrants. A provisional deal to avert the tariffs was reached in June.\n\nMexico sends about 80% of its exports, much of which are manufactured goods like cars and televisions, to the United States.\n\nThe PMI index is composed of five sub-indexes tracking changes in new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.", "description": "Mexican manufacturing declines for fourth third straight month", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
