It is hardball politics, and the American people, with votes, will get their say about it next year.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have emerged from hiding to repeat this new party line. \u201cDo I wish President Trump hadn\u2019t raised the issue with the Ukrainian president?\u201d asks Senator John Cornyn, \u201cYes. Should he have left it to Attorney General Bob Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham to raise what role \u2014 if any \u2014 Ukrainians played in the 2016 election including serving as a conduit for the Russian intelligence agencies who hacked Clinton\u2019s emails? Yes. But really, is it right for Democrats to now call for his removal for office over this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for the president to be talking with foreign governments about investigating his political opponents, but impeachment would be a mistake,\u201d says Senator Lamar Alexander, who likewise concludes that \u201can election, which is just around the corner, would be the right way to decide who should be president.\u201d\n\nThere is at least a little bit of logic here. Whether an offense rises to the level of high crime or misdemeanor is obviously a matter of opinion. Sure, they can argue, Trump ran a monthslong campaign to pressure a foreign ally fending off Russian invasion into roughing up his domestic rivals, but everybody makes mistakes, that\u2019s why pencils have erasers, and so on.\n\nOne problem, however, is that Trump is not admitting his mistake. Instead he is openly proclaiming he has an absolute right to do the exact thing Republicans concede he shouldn\u2019t. (\u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d)\n\nA second problem is that the thing Trump has done is designed to tilt the next election. Henninger, weirdly enough, concedes this in the very same column. \u201cIf Rudy could dig up enough dirt to drive down Mr. Biden\u2019s chances of being the nominee, Mr. Trump\u2019s expectation was that the Democrats would default to the unelectable Elizabeth Warren,\u201d he argues. \u201cFaced with the prospect of voting for Sen. Warren and her lynch-mob politics, Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and personality would recede as issues.\u201d If it\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s abuse of power will be enough to help Warren defeat Biden, and Warren offers Trump a more beatable opponent \u2014 and I\u2019m not certain of either premise, but Henninger seems to support both \u2014 then Trump\u2019s wee little mistake might end up giving him a second term. Doesn\u2019t that undermine the case for letting the election answer the question?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump is already going forward with his plan to solicit foreign dirt. Last night, Rudy Giuliani, who has previously teased his efforts to solicit foreign dirt, promised Fox News viewers to watch for new dirt coming out of Romania:\n\nNow Rudy Giuliani is telling Hannity to \"keep your eye on Romania. Just watch Romania\" on the Bidens.\n\n\n\nHe later says he has another country on his list. pic.twitter.com/w3CTGSKf75 \u2014 Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) October 10, 2019\n\nAfter Trump asked China on television to investigate Biden, Michael Pillsbury, one of Trump\u2019s advisers, told the Financial Times yesterday, \u201cI got a quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese.\u201d Pillsbury then appeared on C-Span and denied it (\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to the Financial Times for a month.\u201d) then the FT reporter showed the email containing the quote.\n\nAt this point, active efforts to dig up dirt on the Democrats are hardly necessary. Trump has broadcast to every country that he will reward them diplomatically if they make investigations or claims that harm his domestic rivals. Using his foreign-policy authority to leverage dirt on Americans who oppose him is not a mistake, it is Trump\u2019s ongoing campaign strategy. Either he will be removed from office over it, or he will use that strategy to try to win reelection.", "description": "After weeks of silence or flailing defenses over the Ukraine scandal, the mainstream of the Republican Party has retreated to a new line of defense: Okay, he did it, but let\u2019s not impeach him over it.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chait"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/10/10-trump-impeachment.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
