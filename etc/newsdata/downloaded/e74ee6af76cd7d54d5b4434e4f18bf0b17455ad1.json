But he broke the record, what more can he do?\u201d\n\nAfter starting no more than $1.6 in betting in his first four career starts, Aethero surprisingly drifted on Saturday, getting out to $4.35 while Voyage Warrior was savagely backed into a prohibitive odds-on quote of $1.7.\n\nWhile jockey Joao Moreira teamed up with Moore for the win, the Australian said rival Zac Purton would return to ride the speedster in the Jockey Club Sprint, should he want it.\n\nPurton rode Voyage Warrior on Saturday after being previously booked before the decision was made to take Aethero to the race.\n\n\u201cZac has got the ride unless he wants to go for something else, then I will ask Joao,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cZac always had the ride and he had the booking of Voyage Warrior five or six weeks back so I couldn\u2019t get him off that today. He\u2019s a nice substitute to have, Joao waiting in the wings.\u201d\n\nThe dominance of Aethero\u2019s win had Moore comparing his three-year-old to the great Able Friend who Moore took to great heights.\n\n\u201cJoao had commented that he is verging on another Able Fiend,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting \u2013 exciting for the stable, exciting for the owner and exciting for the racing public that we have another very smart sprinter on our hands.\n\n\u201cHe is not as advanced as what Able Friend was at the same age, he is still very goofy.\u201d\n\nWhile Moore is focused on December\u2019s Group One Hong Kong Sprint with Aethero, he believes he will be able to run over a mile once he straightens out a few of his racing quirks.\n\n\u201cJoao said I had to keep niggling, he is looking for ground, he will get a mile for sure,\u201d he said.", "description": "Boom youngster Aethero has bounced back from a lacklustre last start effort to deliver a stunning performance at Sha Tin on Saturday, bettering Sacred Kingdom\u2019s long-standing 1,000m track record....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/12/aba6184c-ecda-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_185646.JPG?itok=JpwH5byb&v=1570877813", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
