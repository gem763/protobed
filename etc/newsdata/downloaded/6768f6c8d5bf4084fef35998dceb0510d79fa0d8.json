The very next scene showed another woman in a similar thong bikini sitting astride a motorbike and leaning back with one arm bent above her head.\n\n'While we acknowledged that the heads and faces of the women were often shown, in many of the scenes the women looked seductively at the camera with their lips parted and their poses were sexually suggestive - in particular in the scene of the model sprawled out over the bike which presented her as merely a decoration to the bike.\n\n'We did not therefore agree that the women in those scenes were presented as empowered, confident young women. We considered that the cumulative effect of the scenes meant that overall, the products had been presented in an overly-sexualised way that invited viewers to view the women as sexual objects.'\n\nThe ASA statement said: 'We considered that the cumulative effect of the scenes meant that overall, the products had been presented in an overly-sexualised way that invited viewers to view the women as sexual objects'\n\nThe ASA said that while the images were similar to those seen as part of the Love Island series, 'we considered that some viewers who enjoyed the programme would nevertheless be seriously offended by advertising that presented women as sexual objects. Because the ad objectified women, we concluded that it was irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence.'\n\nIn banning the ad, the watchdog said it has told Missguided not to use advertising that objectified women and which was likely to cause serious offence.\n\nIn a second ruling, the ASA also banned a marketing email from another online fashion firm, Boohoo, which featured the subject heading 'Send Nudes'.\n\nIt was designed to promote a collection of natural, skin tone, fashions, however the ASA said it was likely to be understood as referring to requests for sexual photos, which could be a form of sexual harassment.", "description": "Advertising watchdogs have blocked an ad for the Missguided fashion chain, which appeared on an ITV channel as part of a partnership with Love Island, for treating young women as sexual objects.", "authors": ["Sean Poulter Consumer Affairs Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19765050-0-image-a-8_1571183427997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
