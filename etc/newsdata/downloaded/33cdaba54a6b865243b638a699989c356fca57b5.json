Japanese stocks end at 5-1/2-week high on global stimulus hopes\n\nBy Tomo Uetake\n\nTOKYO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Japanese shares hit a 5-1/2-week\n\nclosing high on Monday, supported by hopes that stimulus from\n\nthe world's largest economies would help stave off a global\n\nrecession.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei average ended 0.56% firmer at\n\n21,318.42, while the broader Topix rose 0.91% to\n\n1,551.11 - their highest closing levels since Aug. 2.\n\n\"Three big worries for financial markets - namely, the\n\nU.S.-China trade war, Brexit jitters and Hong Kong protests -\n\nhave retreated and contributed to the risk-on sentiment,\" said\n\nMasayuki Kubota, chief strategist, Rakuten Securities.\n\nGlobal equity markets received a lift after China's central\n\nbank said on Friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks\n\nmust hold as reserves, releasing liquidity to shore up a slowing\n\neconomy dragged down by the Sino-U.S. trade war. Risk sentiment also improved as U.S. Federal Reserve\n\nChairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the central bank will\n\ncontinue to act \"as appropriate\" to sustain the economic\n\nexpansion in the world's biggest economy. However, broader stock market gains were tempered in the\n\nwake of lacklustre economic data - U.S. job growth slowed more\n\nthan expected in August, while earlier on Monday data showed\n\nJapan's economy grew at a slower pace than initially estimated\n\nin the second quarter. All of Tokyo's 33 sub-sectors ended in positive territory,\n\nwith oil and coal products and construction stocks\n\namong the top performing sectors, up 1.6% and 1.5%,\n\nrespectively.\n\nElsewhere, regional bank shares rallied broadly, buoyed by\n\ngrowing speculation of further consolidation in the industry\n\nafter SBI Holdings and Shimane Bank announced a capital tie-up\n\nplan on Friday.\n\nTsukuba Bank ended 9.8% firmer, Tochigi Bank\n\nsoared 9.2% and Bank of Kochi Ltd advanced\n\n4.6%, while Shimane Bank , which jumped by daily limit\n\nof 16.4% in the previous session, added 1.6%. SBI Holdings\n\nclosed 1.2% higher.\n\nBucking the broad market trend, Nissan Motor dipped\n\n0.2% after the Nikkei newspaper reported Chief Executive Hiroto\n\nSaikawa as saying he wanted to \"pass the baton\" to the next\n\ngeneration as soon as possible.\n\nA source told Reuters the carmaker's nominating committee\n\nwill discuss Saikawa's resignation and possible successors on\n\nMonday.", "description": "Japanese stocks end at 5-1/2-week high on global stimulus hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB820J9_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
