It's complicated", "language": "en", "text": "More restaurants and supermarkets are adopting environmentally conscious, plant-based foods that taste, smell and look nearly identical to traditional beef burger patties.\n\nLast month, the Impossible Burger made its grocery debut in all 100 Wegmans grocery stores in seven states while Burger King continued to sell the plant-based Impossible Whopper nationwide.\n\nSimilarly, the company\u2019s competitor Beyond Meat scored a 12-week test run of the Beyond Burger at select locations for one of the world\u2019s largest restaurant chains \u2013 McDonald\u2019s.\n\nWhile these meatless burgers have been proven to be better for the environment, some question whether they're nutritionally better than beef.\n\nHere\u2019s a deep dive into the nutrition label.\n\nWhat are the ingredients in an Impossible Burger?\n\nA first glance at the nutrition label shows Impossible Burgers are almost identical to traditional beef burgers.\n\nThey\u2019re both about 240 calories and contain about 8 grams of saturated fat. However, a few key differences set them apart.\n\nOne difference is the amount of sodium in a traditional beef burger versus an Impossible Burger. Beef contains very little sodium, unless added independently when cooking, whereas Impossible Burgers contain 370 milligrams or 16 percent of the daily value.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, the ideal intake of sodium per day is 1,500 milligrams.\n\nDr. Sue Klapholz, vice president of Nutrition & Health at Impossible Foods, says the company\u2019s research and development team are working to decrease the amount of sodium and saturated fat in the product.\n\n\u201cEven if we think we can be healthy, we can always be healthier,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re always going to strive to be better.\u201d\n\nKlapholz argues that the Impossible Burger should have no problem fitting into a low sodium diet for people who have hypertension or are just looking for less sodium intake with their food.\n\nShalene McNeill, executive director of nutrition science, health and wellness at the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, says that if meat-eaters are looking for a way to get more protein in their diet with less sodium \u2013 then just turn back to beef.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting any nutritional advantage; some would argue that you\u2019re getting less quality because it\u2019s not natural nutrients and has more sodium,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could just eat the beef you love with a salad or butternut squash.\"\n\nThe \u201cnot natural nutrients\u201d McNeill referenced is the genetically modified heme iron that Impossible Burger adds to their product to create that juicy red color and beefy taste.\n\nHeme is a high-quality iron that is naturally present in all beef. Impossible Foods was able to re-create that essential nutrient by taking the DNA from soybean plants, where heme is found in the root nodules, and inserting it into a genetically engineered yeast, according to its website.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved the genetically modified heme as \u201cgenerally recognized as safe,\u201d or GRAS, in July 2018.\n\nBeyond Meat vs. Impossible Burger vs. traditional beef\n\nNutrition experts are divided on how meatless burgers fit into daily, balanced diets due to the lack of research surrounding the genetically modified heme iron created by Impossible Foods.\n\nBeyond Meat does not include heme iron in its burger and instead, relies on plant-based iron. Heme iron is more absorbable to the body than plant-based iron, but a company spokesperson says Vitamin C is added to increase that absorbability.\n\nWhen comparing the nutrition labels, the Beyond Burger has less saturated fat, more protein and fewer carbohydrates than the Impossible Burger.\n\nIn comparison to a traditional beef burger, both brand burgers have less protein, a lot more sodium and, of course, more carbohydrates.\n\nExperts are still trying to figure out how meat-mimicking alternatives fit into the larger picture of the daily diet. McNeill argues the trend is actually creating mixed signals for people who want to eat healthier.\n\n\u201cWe want you to incorporate vegetables and fruits because people aren\u2019t eating enough of those,\u201d she said. \u201cBut where that\u2019s getting lost is that you don\u2019t need to do that in place of meat. They\u2019re a perfect match.\u201d", "description": "Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat have rolled out its burgers for the greater public to consumer, but is it healthier than their beefy alternatives?", "authors": ["Adrianna Rodriguez", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XRmafs8hhrohIMYUw3ueGA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/2c261087-6f0d-4f92-920b-bddaceb01310/33ecf533-e293-5a5a-b639-d7f00539dc74/data_3_0.jpg?s=0e067b2583c130412c156875d9c24f81&c=b93ce78a7867f6d40a7c11b20c778ede&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
