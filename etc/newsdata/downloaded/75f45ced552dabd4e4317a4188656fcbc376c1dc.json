But in 1971, the United States officially unhitched itself from the gold standard \u2013 where currencies are backed by gold on a \u201cconvertibility\u201d formula \u2013 effectively decoupling the rest of the developed world from the metal and ushering in a \u201cfiat\u201d system of currency.\n\nGoing for gold\n\nGlobal investment allocators are still using gold to hedge against uncertainty, however \u2013 especially where it is sovereign. Bob Vassie says the main demand for gold, hence its rising price even as production increases, is in physical holdings of it. Gold investors typically buy gold ETFs (electronically traded funds) and stock in the gold mining companies. But Vassie says there has been a leaning to holding gold itself \u2013 in bullion, in a vault \u2013 not only by central banks and governments, but also by banks and large funds.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need a massive increase in physical gold to influence the demand,\u201d says Vassie. \u201cThe big funds and the banks only need to increase their holdings by a fraction of a per cent, and because they control portfolios in the billions of dollars, it is reflected in the demand for gold.\u201d\n\nGovernments and large investors are hoarding gold as a hedge against uncertainty. Getty Images\n\nThis outlook showed up in the World Gold Council\u2019s second-quarter update for 2016. Overall gold demand was up only 15 per cent on the same period last year, but investment demand was up 141 per cent.\n\nWhile the banks and funds quietly push up their gold holdings, government activity is on the radar of many economists. Russia increased its holding of physical gold by more than 208 tonnes in 2015 and is continuing to buy physical gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the six months to January 2016, China bought more than 100 tonnes of gold and announced it intended to buy a total of 215 tonnes of the metal during 2016.\n\nChina\u2019s \u2013 and the world\u2019s \u2013 biggest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), has acquired the Barclays gold depository in London, a facility that can store 2000 tonnes. It has also been reported that ICBC plans to build a massive gold storage facility in Qianhai free-trade zone, in conjunction with Hong Kong\u2019s Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society. Large banks and security companies have plans for vaults in China, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nThe Federal Reserve building in New York holds about one-quarter of the world's gold reserves. Getty Images\n\nThe biggest buyer of gold in the past decade has been the Central Bank of Russia, but the world\u2019s biggest official holder is the US with 8134 tonnes, followed by Germany (3380 tonnes), Italy (2452), France (2436), China (1808), Russia (1499) and Switzerland on 1040 tonnes.\n\nThe IMF itself holds 2814 tonnes, an indication perhaps of the necessity of gold as a counterweight to monetary policies and quantitative easing.\n\nThe current spate of gold-buying \u2013 and the accumulation policies of China and Russia \u2013 means official world holdings rose to more than 32,000 tonnes in 2015, their highest level since 2002.\n\nIn a world of uncertainty, the biggest investors are hoarding the metal. It may be a smart hedge against challenging times, but they need a place to keep it \u2013 somewhere even invading armies will have trouble accessing.\n\nBank vaults offer the ultimate security: impenetrable doors. Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world's safest gold depositories\n\nFederal Reserve Bank, New York City It holds about one-quarter of the world's gold reserves, of which only 5 per cent belongs to the US government, the rest being stored for foreign governments and commercial banks. The Federal Reserve gold vault is carved out of bedrock, 25 metres below ground level. It is airtight when sealed and there's only one entrance, a 90-tonne steel cylinder walkway. There are 122 separate compartments in the vault, which are padlocked and \"sealed\" by the Fed's gold auditor after the gold is weighed and the markings checked and recorded.\n\nFort Knox, Kentucky Although Fort Knox was the setting for the gold heist in Ian Fleming's Goldfinger, it holds only one-quarter of the gold held at the Fed building in New York. However, Fort Knox is considered impenetrable because, although managed by the Department of Treasury, it sits in a US Army base surrounded by a solid granite wall with machine-gun posts and armed soldiers. The vault is sealed with a 22-tonne door so complex it requires a 10-person team to unlock.\n\nBank of England, London Under the ground at Threadneedle Street is a holding pen for more than 5000 tons of gold. Like the Fed in New York, the Bank of England holds its own sovereign reserves, as well as those of foreign governments and banks. The BoE has a complex, multi-person security system, armed guards and unpublished electronic security measures. However, one of the famous security aspects is its analogue locks, turned by 90 centimetre-long keys. Apparently a mix of modern and old technologies makes it more difficult for cyber thieves to intrude.\n\nDominion Bank, Toronto In World War II, the contents of the Bank of England gold vault were shipped to Canada for safe-keeping. The vault that would do the job as well as London's? The Dominion Bank. Constructed on bedrock, its vault is surrounded by surveillance corridors and sealed with a 40-tonne door. According to legend, the door is so well machined that a hairpin can prevent it from closing.\n\nCentral Bank of Russia, Moscow Two-thirds of Russia's gold holdings are secured in the 17,000-square-metre central depository of the Central Bank in Moscow (the other third is held in St Petersburg). Most of the Russian gold is held in \"standard\" gold bars \u2013 which weigh between 10 and 14 kilograms and are stacked in wooden and plastic containers. The Central Bank of Russia claims no security breaches have been recorded at this fortress: along with modern security measures, the government has significant prohibitions about what details the media can reveal.\n\nDubai Multi Commodities Centre, Dubai Built in 2009, originally to repatriate UAE gold and silver from London vaults, the DMCC also houses the gold and silver once held by many Middle East institutions in London and Switzerland. Its gold vaults are five storeys underground, heavily guarded and sealed by steel and concrete. Entry to them consists of a deliberately confusing system of multiple elevators.", "description": "Investors and governments are turning to physical gold reserves. But where on earth do you keep it?
