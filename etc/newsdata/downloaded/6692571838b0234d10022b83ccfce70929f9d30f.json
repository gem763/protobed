It also has dozens of entries on protesters and other activists, similar to several pro-government telegram channels.\n\nChris Yeung, chair of the Hong Kong Journalist Association, said the doxxing of journalists was an attack on press freedom and appeared to be part of a \u201cconcerted and apparently orchestrated campaign to undermine reporting of the protests in Hong Kong and to intimidate reporters\u201d.\n\nThe leak, however, represents just a small proportion of doxxing cases, which have skyrocketed in the past three months. Hong Kong\u2019s privacy commission said it had received 1,376 complaints and 126 enquiries between 14 June and 18 September regarding personal information being leaked online, according to Stephen Kai-yi Wong, privacy commissioner for personal data.\n\nWhile journalists have become a high-profile target, about 40% of cases involve police officers while the rest concern government officials, community leaders, the families of police officers, and other citizens, Wong said.\n\nCraig Choy, a spokesperson for Hong Kong\u2019s Progressive Lawyers Group and a specialist in data protection law, said the high volume of cases was unprecedented in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cBefore [the protests], occasionally, we would see doxxing of other people but it is not very common in Hong Kong. This time and in this kind of scale and the number of victims is unprecedented,\u201d Choy said.\n\nThe privacy commission has referred nearly 1,000 cases for criminal investigation and consideration for prosecution. Eight people were arrested in July for doxxing police officers, according to Hong Kong Free Press.\n\nChoy said doxxing of police began after officers stopped wearing badge numbers on their uniforms when they attended protests \u2013 leading protesters to attempt to identify officers independently as police tactics and arrests began to escalate.\n\nTelegram channels like Dadfindboy, with more than 136,000 subscribers, continue to share social media photos of Hong Kong police officers with other identifying information.\n\nHong Kong police were criticised this week by Amnesty International for its excessive use of force at protests and during the arrest of anti-government protesters.", "description": "Campaigns to expose personal details of those on both sides of protests skyrocket, with nearly 1,000 cases being investigated", "authors": ["Erin Hale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fdcbc6132d3569b1c7f79bd5f11342cd8f4d6ad/0_320_4823_2895/master/4823.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49fa9141579f63516aa2a514772377fc", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
