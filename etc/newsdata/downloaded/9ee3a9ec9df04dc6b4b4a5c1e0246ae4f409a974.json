The site had been checked previously. There is no sign of violence to the body and no indication of an accident.\"\n\nA Danske spokesman said the bank was saddened by the news. \"Our thoughts are with the family.\"\n\nThe bank is under investigation in countries including the Britain, Denmark, Estonia and the US over the suspicious payments.\n\nThe scandal centres on the branch's handling of money flowing from Russia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova.\n\nInternational financier Bill Browder, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's most public critics, has long alleged that Danske's Estonian branch was \"one of the main conduits related to the fraud\".\n\nImage copyright Ole Jensen\n\nDanske Bank chief executive Chris Vogelzang said trust in the bank had collapsed since the scandal.\n\nThe high level of trust in Denmark, which enjoys a reputation as being one of the least corrupt nations, meant that there had been fewer incentives to control risks, which led to problems outside the Nordic region, Mr Vogelzang said.\n\n\"Thieves and criminals will rather go to the weak spots than to the stronger spots. And... my bank had weakened defences. It was not bad faith, we just weren't organised,\" he said.\n\nIn 2018, the chief executive of the Danish Bank, Thomas Borgen, stepped down following an investigation into the payments.\n\nIn February, Estonia told Danske Bank to close its branch in Tallinn before the end of 2019.", "description": "Aivar Rehe ran Danske Bank's Estonia arm, at the centre of a \u20ac200bn money laundering investigation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10E60/production/_108961296_d6183c45-06ef-488d-ad83-675d5cb8c662.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
