We must moderate our language.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson replied: \u201cI have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my life.\u201d\n\nMs Cox was murdered days before the EU referendum by a white supremacist, who saw her as a \u201ctraitor\u201d because of her support for the Remain campaign and refugees.\n\nLabour MP Lucy Powell told the House of Commons that the murder \u201cdid not happen in a vacuum\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of language and the context that led to the murder of an MP leaving her surgery of an evening in a small market town by somebody from the far right,\u201d she added.\n\nThe call for moderation was repeated by several MPs including Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves, who condemned the \u201cdangerous language of betrayal and surrender, which sows division and worse in the communities we all serve\u201d.\n\nConservative Jeremy Lefroy said the majority of MPs wanted to leave the EU with a favourable deal and warned: \u201cWith freedom of speech, on which we fully agree, comes responsibility, and sometimes that responsibility means not saying what one might like to say - words like \u2018surrender\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019 and \u2018treason\u2019.\u201d\n\nExperts have said the prime minister and some other pro-Brexit politicians are \u201cusing the language of the far right\u201d and playing into extremist narratives.\n\nChloe Colliver, who leads the digital research unit at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue think-tank, said that by using the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d and positioning himself as enacting the \u201cwill of the people\u201d, Mr Johnson was \u201ccalling successfully to a nationalist interpretation of the Brexit debate\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt seems very purposeful to me and it really harks back to the Second World War nostalgia in this debate, which plays powerfully to the far right and nationalist groups,\u201d she previously told The Independent.\n\nSenior police officers have repeatedly called for politicians and other public figures to avoid worsening tensions around Brexit with inflammatory language.\n\nMartin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, issued a warning over the \u201cincredibly febrile atmosphere\u201d as police are brace for potential unrest next month.\n\nReports of abuse and death threats towards MPs have been rocketing, with Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick describing the scale and ferocity of attacks as \u201cextraordinary\u201d.", "description": "Far-right extremists are celebrating Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d comments in parliament amid mounting condemnation over his rhetoric.", "authors": ["Lizzie Dearden"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/11/Boris-Johnson-downing-street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
