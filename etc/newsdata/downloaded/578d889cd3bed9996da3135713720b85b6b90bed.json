The Vision M is built around a strong and light carbon-fibre monocoque, like the current i8 model. It will be able to drive for up to 100 kilometres on its batteries, which makes it suitable for use in the zero emission zones many believe will soon come to major European CBDs. However, when pushed hard, the Vision M Next will use its electric system and turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine in tandem to unleash 441kW. Top speed is said to be 300km/h, and acceleration from rest to 100km/h takes a mere three seconds.\n\nThe Vision M is a message to the driver, for people who love driving and are afraid they are going to lose that. \u2014 Adrian van Hooydonk, BMW Group\n\n\u201cWe are not dogmatic,\u201d says van Hooydonk. \u201cWe are not saying that everything will be electric only. For the next 10 years plug-in hybrids will play a big role, because if you want to go fast and you want to go far, and to also drive free of emissions in the city, then a hybrid system is probably the best way to go.\u201d\n\nThe 55-year-old Dutchman insists the driver assistance systems and artificial intelligence built into future BMW sports cars will not take the driving sensation away, but improve it. \u201cThe Vision M is a message to the driver, for people who love driving and are afraid they are going to lose that.\u201d\n\nHe says the M1 remains a BMW icon, while the i8 paved the way for plug-in hybrid performance cars, which are becoming increasingly common. \u201cIt is unavoidable to reference those two cars when you do something new.\u201d\n\nBMW is also preparing to take high-performance motorcycles into the electric age and has unveiled the Vision DC Roadster concept. Edgar Heinrich, the head designer at BMW\u2019s Motorrad motorcycle division, stresses the challenge of a fully electric motorcycle. \u201cThere are two big questions,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you make an electric motorcycle emotional \u2013 they are usually perceived more like a washing machine or drier \u2013 and how do you make a BMW out of it?\u201d\n\nThe Vision DC Roadster concept motorcycle.\n\nThe main problem, he says, is that \u201ca bike is basically defined by the engine, and with an electric engine you don\u2019t have any mechanical icon any more\u201d. In an electric motorcycle, the batteries \u2013 which provide little visual interest \u2013 take up far more space than the compact electrical motor.\n\nSince it lacks the engine and fuel tank, Heinrich says they created a stance with a \u201cclear front wheel orientation\u201d and have drawn attention to \u201clittle jewels\u201d, such as the milled aluminium trellis frame and the intricate eco-skeleton around where the fuel tank would otherwise be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have a lightweight feeling because electric bikes look a bit heavy \u2026 a sort of floating look that gives it a light, nimble feel. It has to speak to your guts, which is always important.\u201d\n\nMany BMW motorcycles are immediately recognised by their distinctive boxer-twin engines, with the exposed cylinders jutting out to aid cooling. \u201cYou need radiators on an electric bike too,\u201d Heinrich says, \u201cand it makes sense to put them out in the airstream.\u201d\n\nThe radiators actually move out slightly when the bike is started. The result is a thoroughly modern reimagining of the boxer engine profile, suggesting to enthusiasts that although radically different, the brand\u2019s heritage values have been maintained. It helps, of course, that an electric motor delivers its full torque immediately and provides what Heinrich calls \u201cbreathtaking acceleration\u201d.\n\nThe trio of BMW \u201cNext\u201d concepts, from left: Vision Next 100, Vision M Next and iNext.\n\nAs well as linking the old and new, there is the challenge of north, south east and west. This is reflected in one of the more controversial aspects of contemporary BMW design \u2013 the way its car grilles are getting so much larger, particularly in the updated 7-Series limousine and the new flagship SUV, the X7.\n\n\u201cRecently we have offered various sizes and shapes of grilles,\u201d says van Hooydonk. \u201cOn an 8-Series coupe it is horizontal, quite flat; on an X7, quite tall. Then on the 7-Series we\u2019ve changed the grille dramatically, and people notice that.\u201d\n\nDid the designers realise it would be polarising? \u201cYes, we suspected that. But for the customers in the most relevant markets there was not enough presence, so we decided to do something fairly dramatic.\u201d\n\nIn Europe and Australia, a 7-Series customer wants to go unnoticed, with a sort of stealth vehicle. In Asia and the US, it is the opposite. \u2014 Adrian van Hooydonk, BMW Group\n\nHe said the 7-Series is the most difficult car when it comes to pleasing the tastes of all markets. \u201cIn Europe and Australia, a 7-Series customer wants to go unnoticed, with a sort of stealth vehicle, no chrome. In Asia and the US it is quite the opposite, so it is impossible to do all of that in one car.\u201d\n\nThe good news, says van Hooydonk, is that the tastes of the global markets are growing closer together \u201cand I think for the future that will make our job a little easier\u201d.\n\nAs for the not-much-less controversial X7 frontal treatment, van Hooydonk says when vehicles become bigger, the grille can also grow with them. \u201cIf you ask me, the X7 grille is right for the size of the car.\u201d\n\nThe author visited BMW headquarters in Munich as a guest of the company.\n\nThe heritage issue of LUXURY is out on Friday, September 6 inside The Australian Financial Review.
