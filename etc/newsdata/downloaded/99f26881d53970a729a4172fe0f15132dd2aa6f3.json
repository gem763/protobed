But it soon becomes clear that the mysterious healer doesn\u2019t work for free.\n\nAs the trailer for Netflix chiller Rattlesnake\u2014from writer-director Zak Hilditch, who previously made Stephen King adaptation 1922 for the streamer\u2014shows, in order to save her daughter\u2019s life, Egojo\u2019s character has unwittingly struck a bargain with some very dark forces. Though the bill she receives is tremendous (diabolical, even), is there any price too great to save her little girl?\n\nThe set-up is pretty simple and most of the movie looks like it\u2019ll be one woman racing against time\u2014but Egojo (whose many credits include True Detective, It Comes at Night, Alien: Covenant, and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them) is reliably great, and if you saw 1922 you know Hilditch can effectively turn the screws when it comes to a troubled character faced with some heady consequences.\n\nRattlesnake hits Netflix U.S. on October 26.", "description": "When her young daughter is bitten by a poisonous snake in the middle of nowhere, a frantic mother (Carmen Egojo) gratefully accepts help from the only other human being for miles.
