We\u2019re talking to experts and testing products ourselves to get those precious eight hours a night. Excellent sheets, by Morrow Soft Goods. Photo: Morrow\n\nLast summer, we tested and wrote about the best linen sheets. This particular bedding product had recently taken on a life of its own, and there were so many companies \u2014 new and old \u2014 making sheets out of flax that we felt like it deserved an analysis.\n\nSince then, even more brands have sprung up. So naturally, we decided to update this guide. For the first go-around, Lauren Levy and Margaret Rhodes sleep-tested sheets from several different brands, including newer lines like Parachute and Brooklinen as well as beloved standbys like West Elm and Matteo. This second time around, I pitched in with the very taxing work of sleeping on a handful of linens from other brands that have come to our attention.\n\nAll three of us have tried Parachute, and would all agree that for the feel, the price, and the color options, it\u2019s one of your best bets. But Lauren also loved Matteo, a company based out of Los Angeles that also does linen clothing and home goods. As for Margaret, she\u2019s found a new love: a small company called Linoto that makes the most substantial sheets she\u2019s tried so far. If you\u2019re contemplating linen sheets and want details, here are the ones we endorse, starting with the newest additions up top. (Quick note: As we did with our recent mattress-buying update, we\u2019re listing full-size sets at the starting price.)\n\nSnowe\n\nSimone: The Parachute sheets were sturdy and Casper sheets were soft. But, perhaps, Snowe\u2019s linen sheets offered the best of both worlds. In fact, I\u2019ll go one step further: These sheets are the softest I\u2019ve ever slept on. My last apartment\u2019s washer-dryer didn\u2019t dry so well, so I would end up slinging my sheets over closet doors to dry them. Most linen sheets air-dry a little stiff and starchy, but the Snowe sheets impressively preserved their ripply, breezy softness. Now they get dried in a harsh industrial laundromat dryer, and they roll out of there just as delicate and structurally sound as they day I first unfurled them. They appear built to last. Everyone praises linen\u2019s breathability as a solution for sweaty summer nights, and the Snowe sheets were substantial enough to use alone. But with cooler nights on the way, I\u2019m confident that Snowe sheets will be a warming cocoon. A note about sizing: It is generous. If you have one of those super-tall mattresses, it won\u2019t be an issue \u2014 but I do find myself cinching up excess fabric underneath the mattress so they feel more taut.\n\nVerdict: Snowe\u2019s palette is limited \u2014 just three shades of white, gray, and pale blue \u2014 and they\u2019re a smidge pricier than your West Elms and Brooklinens, but if you are still on the fence about linen feeling soft, buy these.\n\nLinoto\n\nMargaret: I read about Linoto in a few other roundups, and then saw that the sheets are actually all made in a workshop located nearby, in upstate New York. Linoto offers more product range than anyone else I\u2019ve seen: The 100-percent-linen sheet sets come in a rainbow of color choices (I tried these in the terra cotta color), and the heavier Belgian Eco and Organic Linen sets come in white and flax.\n\nLinoto\u2019s founder, Jason, has included a wealth of information on the site about the mills and chemicals (or lack thereof) that Linoto uses, and I\u2019d recommend that anyone check it out. For a quicker review, I\u2019ll say first that upon unboxing these, they immediately felt heavier and more like the idea of an heirloom sheet than other I\u2019ve encountered. A lot of other brands do an enzyme prewash to give sheets a lived-in feel before that\u2019s actually true \u2014 Linoto doesn\u2019t. I actually got to talk to Jason about the best ways to break in the sheets, and besides just regular washing and time, he recommends adding a little hair conditioner to the wash in lieu of fabric softener. Anyway, these have the right ratio of soothing to crisp, and the sheets hold their shape after several nights of sleep. It\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t last for ages.\n\nVerdict: If you want heirloom-level linen, buy.\n\nCasper\n\nMargaret: You ended up taking the linen sheets from Casper, which are brand new to the company as of late September. Thoughts?\n\nSimone: I picked up a set of Parachute linen sheets and a duvet earlier this summer right around the time you and Lauren first covered linen sheets. I found them to be incredibly sturdy feeling, but also at times a little too thick, in that I\u2019d have to kick them off if it got too hot, though softness was never really an issue. The Casper sheets also come out of the box feeling incredibly soft, as in you don\u2019t need to wash them three times before you use them \u2014 though I did give them one pretest wash. What I noticed immediately was a super lightweightness (the sheets identify themselves as \u201cAiry\u201d) without a bit of stiffness; they come completely broken-in in a good way. It\u2019s the kind of softness you really only get from a well-loved T-shirt; there is nothing scratchy about these sheets. The other thing is the fit \u2014 they\u2019re just the right size, which sounds not that remarkable, but certain linen sheets can run a little baggy.\n\nVerdict: If you kind of miss those jersey sheets you slept on in college, but want an upgrade, buy these.\n\nCultiver\n\nMargaret: Cultiver is an Australian brand that\u2019s sort of a peer to Parachute and Brooklinen, but is further along in terms of the breadth of homeware products they offer. I\u2019d heard of them but will admit that I only realized we needed to check them out after seeing that Wirecutter named them the best linen sheets. And they turned out to be lovely: They are definitely on the soft side, like Morrow or Casper, rather than the hearty-textured side, like Linoto and Parachute. (I will say, they also run on the baggy side.) But I think Cultiver most stands out for having lots of colors, and for mixing those hues so carefully. Like, it\u2019s one thing to sell purple linen sheets and another thing entirely to sell a berry-stained color that could somehow pass as a very interesting neutral.\n\nVerdict: These cost a bit more than some other sheet sets here (and only come in queen and king sizes), but they offer the widest range of non-boring neutral colors, so buy if that matches your needs.\n\nSea Me\n\nMargaret: Sea Me is yet another just-launched linen sheets company. It was kind of obvious already that there\u2019s this direct-to-consumer boom in bedding, but Sea Me\u2019s arrival, to me at least, signaled proof that the wave is a big one. Anyway, I wanted to try stuff from this company, which is from Ukraine, for two reasons: (1) They sell products in absolutely beautiful colors, particularly this emerald green, and (2) the price point is a smidge lower than some other startups, and accessibility matters.\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to try the actual fitted and top sheets from Sea Me, but I did get to check out the duvet cover and shams, so can comfortably, assuredly say that the hand (and body) feel of their linen is nice: sturdy, which is now the way I prefer linen. No scratchiness. I\u2019d compare this to the other hefty sheet-makers like Linoto, Parachute, and Coyuchi.\n\nSea Me The mossy emerald green that I love. The pieces are sold separately, so those who don\u2019t like a top sheet can skip it and save $95. From $95 at Sea Me Buy\n\nVerdict: Buy! These cost a few bucks less than others. And then you can own something from a not-yet-ubiquitous brand. The catch is that shipping is $40, because Sea Me is international. So it would be wise to buy a full set and make it worth it.\n\nMore Strat-endorsed linen sheet sets\n\nMargaret: You wrote about linen sheets on the Strategist first, making you the resident expert. Should we first establish why they\u2019re so incredible?\n\nLauren: I used Brooklinen sheets first, and those made me fall in love with linen sheets. They feel so light, it\u2019s almost like you don\u2019t feel it. It\u2019s just brushing against you when you sleep. If you\u2019ve only used cotton or whatever, you can\u2019t even compare it to the feel of linen sheets.\n\nMargaret: I\u2019ve been trying to come up with the vocabulary to describe it, and people always say it\u2019s breathable; it\u2019s cool to the touch. But I still don\u2019t feel like I have the right word to describe how it feels like such an embrace.\n\nLauren: It\u2019s like an angel\u2019s kiss.\n\nMargaret: There\u2019s a live quality to it. You feel like you\u2019re being whispered against. Which makes me sound like a psycho, but \u2014\n\nLauren: But it\u2019s true.\n\nBrooklinen\n\nLinen Core Sheet Set Seen here in cream; Brooklinen\u2019s sheets also come in a range of earthy tones including a bright moss shade and a rich pomegranate. From $269 at Brooklinen Buy\n\nVerdict: You can\u2019t go wrong with Brooklinen. We say buy, so long as you aren\u2019t looking for a bright color.\n\nParachute\n\nLauren: There is a tactile-ness to good linen, which is one reason I love Parachute. If I\u2019m picking favorites, these are one of my top two. In a weird way, the most important thing to me is the color options because if I don\u2019t want cream sheets, then I don\u2019t want to be limited to just that. I put aesthetics above a lot of things. So I bought Parachute sheets in coal, and have the duvet cover in fog.\n\nMargaret: I tried Parachute as well, and was especially curious about it because I think it\u2019s become the go-to brand. Like when Simone wanted linen sheets, her friend who\u2019s a fashion buyer told her to just get the West Elm ones, but Simone was like, \u201cNo, I just wanted the Parachute ones.\u201d She got the fog color, but the coal color we both have is great \u2014 there\u2019s something so relaxing about waking up with all that darkness around you. You can get away from the light that bounces off white sheets.\n\nLauren: I also think the price is right on Parachute. I would have bought Matteo from the jump, but I wasn\u2019t ready to spend $430 on sheets.\n\nMargaret: The Parachute sheets feel a bit more like what I imagine European heirloom sheets to feel like. They have that heavy, grainy, but still really soft feeling. They felt great right out of the box, like they had been washed many times already.\n\nLinen Sheet Set in \u201cFog\u201d Parachute\u2019s \u201cfog\u201d color is the one if you\u2019re interested in a cool, placid, hazy bed environment. Add a top sheet and it\u2019s $279. From $169 at Parachute Buy\n\nLinen Sheet Set in \u201cBone\u201d A nice nonwhite option. From $169 at Parachute Buy\n\nLinen Sheet Set in \u201cCoal\u201d The \u201ccoal\u201d sheets both of us are obsessed with. From $169 at Parachute Buy\n\nVerdict: We both think Parachute is the best all-around company, factoring the middle-of-the-road price, the substantial feel of the linen, and the color options. We say buy.\n\nMatteo\n\nMargaret: What about Matteo? It\u2019s been around longer and is definitely a known go-to for seriously good linen. (Its sheets also cost considerably more.) It has 18 colors \u2014 was the color swatch on its website faithful to the color you got?\n\nLauren: Well, it sent white ones. But that\u2019s a good question. It would make me nervous to choose a color online and buy them. With just the \u201cfog,\u201d you can tell what you\u2019re going to get. But at the same time, 18 colors \u2014 killing it. I fell in love with the Matteo sheets because they\u2019re so light. They feel like a thin nothingness that\u2019s also incredibly soft and cozy, whereas the others have a heavier quality.\n\nLinen Sheet Set $279 (was $396, now 30% off) Heads-up: Matteo\u2019s queen and king sets are currently on sale at Huckberry. $279 at Huckberry Buy\n\nVerdict: Matteo makes the closest thing to a Status Sheet, among the brands on this list. It shows up in the price, though, so this sale is an especially good one. We say buy while they\u2019re on sale \u2014 or put them on a registry and hope you get lucky.\n\nWest Elm\n\nLauren: I\u2019m curious to hear about the West Elm. Multiple interior designers recommended them to me when I first did this post.\n\nMargaret: They were across-the-board great. I thought they felt a little crisper than the others \u2014 just enough that they had a bit more of that just-washed, clean-sheet feeling. It was still better and softer than the regular percale Casper sheets I\u2019ve been sleeping on, but for linen, it was the cleanest feeling.\n\nLauren: That, I think, is nice for people who are not sure if they want to go full linen. And other ones get wrinkly, so maybe you can fold these and make your bed in a more crisp way.\n\nMargaret: It\u2019s dip-your-toe-in linen. Maybe you get them for the guest bed in the house, so your guests don\u2019t get full linen, but just a little. Also, the elastic on the fitted sheets was a lot tighter, so it snapped under my mattress in this very satisfying, at-attention way. Which was nice because I hate it when a sheet bags out and gets loose.\n\nLauren: I have a lot of opinions on the fittedness of the sheets. Every queen-size and king-size bed is the same, so they should all be fitted. I will note that the Parachute ones I have are baggy. But the Matteo ones are immediately the right fit and they stay tight.\n\nMargaret: It\u2019s also worth pointing out that the West Elm ones are currently on sale (with the code FRIENDS), so you can get a queen set for under or around $200. Plus, I don\u2019t know, if you\u2019re getting married and you\u2019re registering at traditional stores instead of Zola, you can add these.\n\nVerdict: West Elm\u2019s options are a super-solid, entry-level linen sheet. Especially with the current (and likely recurring) sale, we say buy.\n\nMorrow\n\nMargaret: So I tested Morrow, or More-oh. Maybe it\u2019s tomorrow, but without the to. Like you get in your sheets and wake up tomorrow. Anyway, these are phenomenal and they are soft in a downy way. Jean Godfrey-June recommended them as well. I got them in greige, and that was so much nicer than other regular cream-colored sheets I\u2019ve slept on in the past. I like that flaxen, undyed look. I also really like that they come in just one full set with the fitted and top sheets and pillowcases because a lot of other places sell the sheets piecemeal \u2014\n\nLauren: Asking if you want a top sheet? Everyone wants a top sheet! I use a top sheet, 100 percent.\n\nMargaret: The crazy thing is, some people don\u2019t. My best friend hates them, so for her to buy linen sheets from one of these other companies and save almost $100 on the top sheet is a deal. But I love a top sheet and give major props to Morrow for selling one sack of linens, one and done.\n\nLauren: To your word on greige: I\u2019m declaring white sheets over. We can all be more creative than that.\n\nMargaret: Your fog sheets are a great new neutral. There\u2019s another way to keep it clean without paper white.\n\nLauren: I think that\u2019s why millennial pink blew up \u2014 people just needed something different.\n\nHeirloom French Linen Sheet Set Yes, Lauren just declared white sheets over. But if you\u2019re not done with them yet, here you are. From $275 at Morrow Buy\n\nVerdict: These are exquisite, especially if you want something on the softer end of the spectrum. We say buy.\n\nCoyuchi\n\nLauren: So what\u2019s up with Coyuchi?\n\nMargaret: Coyuchi is a California company that started in the \u201990s, and I wanted to try these because they have an interesting business model. Now that there\u2019s this new wave of interest in bedding, they\u2019re trying to reinvent things with a subscription model so that you sign up and pay a little bit each month, and then over time you get new ones. You can pay $39 a month for a queen set of linen sheets and then get new ones every 12 months. Or $19 a month, and get new ones in 24 months. When you return them, they upcycle the old ones. They use all kinds of crazy machinery and liquefied carbon dioxide at some factory and then \u201crefresh\u201d the fabrics. I read that in Fast Company, not just on their website, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just marketing.\n\nLauren: I kind of love that.\n\nMargaret: These felt great, too. Sturdy, substantial, and soft enough out of the box that I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get even better. Just as good as Parachute and West Elm. The top sheet also has a really subtle but really nice stitching detail on it: tiny contrast stitches across the top. I liked that. Also, Moon Juice founder Amanda Chantal Bacon recommends this line because they hold up well over time.\n\nOrganic Linen Chambray Sheet Set (Queen) Squint and you can see the stitching detail I\u2019m so fond of. From $548 at Coyuchi Buy\n\nVerdict: A super-solid choice, but an expensive set if you pay all at once. We say buy, but only if it\u2019s because Coyuchi\u2019s sustainability model is very key for you. Otherwise, other sheets are a better deal.
