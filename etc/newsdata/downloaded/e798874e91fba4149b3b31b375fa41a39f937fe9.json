But it\u2019s the damage they will incur getting there that has the president and his team worried.\n\nThat\u2019s where, they believe, his top allies should come in to run interference. In particular, there is growing frustration that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, has not yet called hearings into the issues that sparked Trump\u2019s interest in Ukraine: Joe Biden\u2019s alleged and unfounded attempts to aid a business whose board his son sat on as well as a conspiracy theory that links Ukraine with 2016 election meddling.\n\n\"Senate Republicans don't have to defend Trump on everything, they just have to do their jobs,\u201d said one senior Trump operative. \u201cPart of that is holding hearings, calling witnesses, and forcing testimony on the misdeeds we already know about\u2014Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2016 election against Trump, the Clinton campaign paying foreign sources to fabricate a dossier against Trump, the politically driven Kavanaugh smear campaign, the son of the former vice president influence-trading overseas, Adam Schiff trying to obtain dirt on Trump from the Ukrainian embassy, and more. What good is controlling half of Congress if Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff get to run the whole show anyway?\"\n\nThe complaints have come from the top down. One source who spoke to Trump in the past two weeks said that the president wondered aloud why Republican lawmakers couldn\u2019t be more like people such as Tom Fitton\u2014the Judicial Watch president who Trump regularly watches on Fox and often excitedly tweets about\u2014when defending him against the impeachment inquiry. And in public, Trump has increasingly let his dissatisfaction with Republican Senate leadership and others be known.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have to get tougher and fight,\u201d the president said at a cabinet meeting at the White House on Monday. \u201cWe have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the election.\u201d\n\nFor all the grumbling, however, the White House has appeared to have done very little to chart out a hearing process of their own. Graham has floated the idea of calling Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to testify. But those plans appear far off\u2014if not dead entirely\u2014as Giuliani has receded from the spotlight.\n\nGraham did not return a request for comment. But one senior Senate aide said that there has been little that the White House has offered that has given members there either direction or confidence.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, there are no emissaries on the Hill telling us what to say on this,\u201d said the senior Senate GOP aide. \u201cI'm not going to rule out any work on our side in terms of looking into other things that are sort of adjacent to the investigations going on. But there is just not a lot of appetite among Senate Republicans. They are not very enthusiastic about defending the indefensible on this stuff.\u201d\n\nEvidence of the divide between the White House and Senate GOPers has emerged in recent days, with allies of the former\u2014including the president\u2019s son Don Jr.\u2014taking to Twitter to berate Republican lawmakers for not doing more, and members of the latter gently distancing themselves from the president on a range of fronts.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said he did not \u201crecall any conversation with the president,\u201d in which he told Trump that his phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was, in fact, \u201cperfect.\u201d", "description": "Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily BeastPresident Trump, his advisers, and his most fervent media allies have grown increasingly irritated with Senate Republicans for failing to counterprogram the Democratic-led House impeachment inquiry.In the weeks since the now-infamous whistleblower complaint", "authors": ["Sam Stein", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/am0hp0N.dvOm1zwm1FLxnQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/c196554b888783b58b8781c38448d905", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
