USA TODAY\n\nYes, Bryce Harper has been watching his old team, the Washington Nationals, march through the National League on its way to the franchise's first World Series appearance.\n\nNo, he does not have any regrets.\n\n\"Jealousy isn't good,\" he told The Athletic's Jayson Stark recently.\n\nIn his seven years with the Nats, Harper never led them as far as they've gone now. The Philadelphia Phillies inked him to a 13-year, $330 million deal this offseason, so Harper has had to watch his former teammates spill champagne throughout October.\n\n\"They made their decision, and I made my decision as well,\" Harper told The Athletic. \"I made the best decision for my family. And I am so happy to be in Philly. It's the place that I wanted to be.\"\n\nAs for how he's handled missing out on the remarkable postseason run by a year?\n\n\"I think it\u2019s about being able to be the person that I am and not saying to myself, 'Oh my gosh, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not a National,' or, 'Oh my gosh, those guys are doing what they\u2019re doing. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m so jealous,'\" Harper told The Athletic. \"No. I\u2019m so happy for them. You know how hard it is to get into the postseason and win games. For them to be able to put it together this year the way they have, it\u2019s an amazing thing.\"\n\nYOUNG GUNS: Nationals ride unique blend of experience, youth to World Series\n\nA modified Bryce Harper jersey before game three of the 2019 NLCS playoff baseball series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTogether, the Nationals and Harper experienced playoff heartbreak. The Game 5 debacle of the 2012 NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals preceded more division series failure in 2014, 2016 and 2017.\n\n'This is for you':Washington Nationals fans ready for more\n\nBut Harper garners zero resentment toward his old team, he said. Plus, who knows if the Nationals go this far with Harper on the roster?\n\n\"Not signing me, they were able to go out and get the starting pitching that they needed and the pitching that they needed for their bullpen,\" he said.\n\nHe also sees the old No. 34 Nationals jerseys that have been duct-taped over and altered.\n\n\"It\u2019s over. I wear No. 3 now. And I play for the Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 you know what I\u2019m saying?\" he told The Athletic. \"I appreciate them supporting me before and buying those jerseys. But now they can do whatever they want with them. They\u2019re all theirs.\"", "description": "Bryce Harper, who'd spent his career with the Nationals, signed with the Philadelphia Phillies this offseason.
