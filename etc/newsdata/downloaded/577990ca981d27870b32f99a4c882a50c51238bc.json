Robert Scheer, robert.scheer@indystar.com\n\nShe had done the move a thousand times before, even more, probably. Lindsey Schuler had been flipping and tucking and twisting since she was a tiny tot in gymnastics.\n\nThis time was different.\n\n\"It was a roundoff back handspring, full twist, and I didn't get far enough back on the mat and I knew in the middle of my twist...\"\n\nThis time was devastating.\n\n\"I could see this girl on the end of the mat, and I knew that I wasn't going to land on my feet back on the floor...\"\n\nSchuler hit a cement wall while she was in midair, parallel to the ground. The momentum sent her crashing down. She landed on her neck.\n\nThis time could not be real. Could it?\n\n\"So I just remember...laying on the floor and then not being able to move.\"\n\nNot being able to move anything from her neck down. Not her pinky finger, not her big toe, nothing. A teammate's mom who was a nurse ran to Schuler's side.\n\n\"She kept asking me, 'Oh, can you feel this? Can you feel this?' \" said Schuler, now 22. \"I was like, 'No, I can't really feel anything, but ask me a math problem because my brain works fine.' \"\n\nAt that moment, lying on a gym floor three and a half years ago, Schuler did something remarkable. She became thankful for what she had. And she started visualizing what it felt like to move, what it felt like to walk and flip and twist.\n\n\"In my mind,\" said Schuler, \"I could always still feel.\"\n\nLindsey Schuler visits with neurosurgeon Dr. Richard Rodgers at St. Vincent Hospital, Indianapolis, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2019.

From the time she could toddle about, she had been on the mats.\n\nSchuler spent 25 hours a week on her sport, working her way up to a level 8 gymnast, who could master level 10 skills, the highest bar in the USA Gymnastics Junior Olympics program.\n\nBut once at Hamilton Southeastern High School (Indiana), Schuler found another way to show off her skills \u2014 cheerleading. It would allow her to be part of the school community, rather than at a gym all those hours.\n\nShe cheered at games and for the school's competitive cheer team. The team was good. Each February, the squad traveled to Florida for nationals, placing first in the state Schuler's freshman year.\n\nWhen her senior year rolled around, Schuler was ready to take her love to the next level. When she tried out for cheer at Purdue University, the coach asked Schuler to join her World Cheerleading team.\n\nLindsey Schuler cheered competitively all four years at Hamilton Southeastern.

As they practiced the routine for the first time, Schuler misjudged her new position.\n\nThe mat out of reach, the girl in her eyesight, the cement wall. And then, Schuler was numb all over.\n\nA faint surgical scar is visible on the neck of Lindsey Schuler as she visits with her medical team at St. Vincent Hospital, Indianapolis, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2019.

Rodgers' phone rang. It was his partner, who was in the emergency room at Ascension St. Vincent Indianapolis.\n\nThere is an 18-year-old girl, a Fishers cheerleader, with a spinal cord injury, his partner was saying. A horrific one, the most severe spinal cord injury there is.\n\nSchuler had suffered a bilateral locked facets, the type of spinal injury typically associated with diving accidents, said Rodgers, with Goodman Campbell Brain and Spine.\n\nFacet joints are the joints in the back part of the spine. When they get dislocated, it causes a sudden change in the size of the spinal canal and leads to severe spinal cord injury, he said.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic defines quadriplegia as \"paralysis below the neck, including both arms and legs.\"\n\nSchuler feels blessed that her car had broken down that day. That meant her mom was at practice with her, there when the accident happened and with her every step of the way. Because of her injury, Schuler was taken to Ascension St. Vincent, a level I trauma center where a neurosurgeon is staffed.\n\nRodgers was waiting when Schuler was wheeled out of the MRI scanner that night. He talked with her about her injury. Schuler doesn't remember any of that.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Rodgers said, \"it's better if you don't remember those parts.\"\n\nWithin two hours of the accident, Schuler was in an operating room. The surgery realigned her spine and took pressure off her spinal cord. Relieving that pressure as quickly as possible is key to long-term recovery, said Lewis Jacobson, trauma medical director at Ascension St. Vincent.\n\n\"You can salvage what's left of the spinal cord that hasn't been permanently damaged,\" he said.\n\nRodgers said there may not always be a good outcome with this type of injury, but it helps with an improved outcome. \"We expect there to be some recovery,\" he said.\n\nSome recovery. Perhaps a hand that moves so a patient can eventually live alone. Maybe a wrist that can extend so they can control an electric wheelchair.\n\n\"We do a lot of work early on preparing that patient and their family for a life that involves significant paralysis,\" Rodgers said, \"because most patients are going to have significant paralysis.\"\n\nMost patients. What has happened with Schuler, Rodgers said, \"is not even remotely expected.\"\n\n'I want to walk at prom'\n\nThe first movement happened while Schuler was still in the intensive care unit of the hospital. She felt her big toe on her right foot move.\n\n\"And I knew that if that was the furthest thing from my injury then, oh, everything else has to come back, as well,\" she said. \"Everything else started slowly falling into place.\"\n\nHer older brother, Zack, on spring break from Washington University in St. Louis, was able to be with her. They played a guessing game. He would pinch her toes and she would try to guess which one he was pinching.\n\nLindsey Schuler was 18 when a severe spinal cord injury left her paralyzed. (Photo: Provided by Lindsey Schuler)\n\nSoon, more feeling returned in her toes. Then, she started feeling her arms. Schuler remembers clasping her hands together and bending her arms up to brush her teeth.\n\nWhen she left the hospital just weeks after the accident, Schuler was in a wheelchair. She had one goal in mind \u2014 to walk to her senior prom.\n\nAt the Rehab Institute of Chicago, where she spent two months as an inpatient and five months as an outpatient, Schuler told her therapist of that first goal.\n\n\"Prom is in about three weeks and I would really like to walk for prom,\" Schuler recalled saying. \"She was like, 'OK.' And she just keeps testing my muscles because nothing is responding. I'm like, 'No, but that's what is going to happen.'\"\n\nHer therapist moved Schuler to a manual wheelchair instead of electric, helping her to build endurance. Together, they outlined the steps she needed to take if she wanted to walk to prom.\n\nBefore long, Schuler was sitting up on the edge of the bed and rolling over. After hours of therapy she would practice more on her own.\n\nLindsey Schuler (center) had a goal of walking at prom. And she did, with the help of a physical therapist, take a few steps. (Photo: Provided by Lindsey Schuler)\n\nThe week before prom, Schuler took her first steps with a walker. At prom, where she spent most of the night sitting, she took a few steps as her therapist held her tightly. Her recovery was still in critical stages and they didn't want to take any chances.\n\nBut Schuler had reached her goal.\n\nNot long after, at graduation, she walked across the stage using canes, and received her diploma to a standing ovation.\n\n\"Which i was not expecting, but it was so absolutely incredible,\" she said, \"just to feel all that love and support in that moment.\"\n\n'Look at you now'\n\nInside Ascension St. Vincent this week, the hospital's trauma team could hardly believe their eyes as Schuler walked in, still with a cane, but she walked in.\n\n\"That is crazy,\" said Kelly Blanton, trauma program manager. \"Oh my goodness, look at you now.\"\n\nRodgers gave Schuler a hug and showed her images of her injury that she hadn't seen before. Schuler and her mom thanked the team.\n\nLindsey Schuler is studying at Butler to become a physician's assistant. (Photo: Provided by Lindsey Schuler)\n\nAnd the team thanked her. Patients like Schuler are a light in their world, a reason to keep doing what they do every single day, said Judy Holsinger, trauma and neuroscience service line director.\n\n\"She was so committed to her own recovery and pushing herself,\" Holsinger said. \"Oftentimes, we have to push the patients. She said, 'I want to do this.'\"\n\nSchuler admits it wasn't always easy being positive.\n\n\"You go from tumbling every day to not having anything,\" said Schuler, now a junior at Butler University, studying to be a physician assistant. \"You have to celebrate every little victory. If you're able to feed yourself or put on a sock, those are huge milestones that you have to celebrate.\"\n\nAnd Schuler is ready for her final victory.\n\n\"In the next couple of years, I want to be able to walk without anything,\" she said. \"I hope to get everything back.\"", "description": "In 2016, cheerleader Lindsey Schuler lay on the floor after doing a handspring, unable to move below her neck.
