That's how he is.\n\n\"But if you want to go in new ways, and I wanted a new path at BVB at this point, then I at least had to ask Jurgen to consider.\u201d\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nIndeed, Klopp reveals he was mid-flight when he took the call from Watzke, with whom he had previously worked for seven years during his time as Dortmund coach.\n\n\u201cMy phone rang while I was on the plane Aki was on it: 'J\u00fcrgen, you have to come back\u2019\u201d reveals Klopp. \"I thought he was kidding,\n\n\"'Are you stupid, have you been drinking, how did you get the idea, I've got a few more years in Liverpool.'\u201d\n\n(Image: Bongarts/Getty Images)\n\nThe Reds boss, whose Kop side would go on to win the Champions League last season, says he did not know how serious Watzke was.\n\nHowever Watzke admits: \"I would not have forgiven myself for not asking him at that moment.\u201d\n\nSo will Klopp ever return? His contract at Anfield runs until 2023 and while he is in no hurry to depart, he admits he could go back if BVB ever truly need him.\n\n\"As a rescuer in need, if the club really needs my help - why should not I do that?\u201d says Klopp.\n\n\"It's very nice that I even have the opportunity. But, I admit, it does not seem so likely.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something new to come.\"", "description": "The Liverpool boss enjoyed seven years at Borussia Dortmund before he joined Liverpool in 2015", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Rex Shutterstock", "Empics Sport", "Bongarts Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20550174.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-v-FC-Red-Bull-Salzburg-UEFA-Champions-League-Group-E-Anfield-21019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
