Ms. Vestager had been widely expected to take a more senior role and leave the day-to-day business of antitrust probes and enforcement to a new official.\n\nThe reappointment of Ms. Vestager, whom President Donald Trump labeled the \u201ctax lady\u201d after her ruling to collect from Apple Inc. what the commission said was back taxes, punctuates Mrs. von der Leyen\u2019s push to be more assertive with economic and commercial competition from the U.S. and China.\n\nThe incoming European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Her office is tasked with shepherding new regulation on artificial intelligence by early next year, as well as with upgrading the bloc\u2019s liability and safety rules for digital platforms.\n\nMs. Vestager was one of the senior officials floated for the commission\u2019s top job, as a lead candidate from the broad family of European centrist politicians championed by French President Emmanuel Macron. Her promotion to commission vice president was part of the July deal in which Mr. Macron secured support for Mrs. von der Leyen.\n\nMs. Vestager was expected to hand over the competition role, which comes with responsibilities for investigating and enforcing antitrust issues, including through hefty fines, as she ascended to a higher post in the commission. It is very rare for commissioners who stay on to keep the same portfolio. The competition commissioner has historically been kept clear of other policy areas, so as not to influence antitrust decisions.\n\nRelated Video The Justice Department is investigating the U.S.'s largest tech firms for allegedly monopolistic behavior. Roughly 20 years ago, a similar case threatened to destabilize Microsoft. WSJ explains.\n\nIn an interview, Ms. Vestager said she will maintain the independence of the antitrust division. \u201cWith the more horizontal responsibility, I will make sure the integrity of our procedures and independence in the law enforcement is nonnegotiable.\u201d She said the commission will focus on enforcing the bloc\u2019s newly established data-protection regime to ensure that users are in control of their data and on enabling businesses in Europe to share and use data for innovation.\n\nMs. Vestager made a name for herself by imposing record antitrust fines on U.S. tech companies, including a total of $9.4 billion on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. She also ordered Ireland to claw back $15 billion from Apple in what the commission called unpaid taxes.\n\nThe Obama administration took aim at Ms. Vestager, saying her approach to tech regulation slanted against U.S. firms, an accusation European officials have denied.\n\nThe unit she has led for the past five years has also pursued high-profile probes against Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as against nontech American giants like McDonald\u2019s Corp. , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Starbucks Corp.\n\nMs. Vestager has drawn vitriol from Washington for years. As U.S. officials pile in with their own scrutiny of Silicon Valley, some American politicians, including Mr. Trump, have accused her of trespassing on Washington\u2019s regulatory turf. In June, Mr. Trump told Fox Business Network that Ms. Vestager \u201chates the United States perhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He said \u201cshe\u2019s suing all our companies. We should be suing Google and Facebook, and perhaps we will.\u201d\n\nMs. Vestager has denied that she is targeting U.S. companies for their nationality or that she harbors any ill intent toward the U.S.\n\nThe 51-year-old Dane, who officials say often pulls out her knitting during discussions, first rose to prominence as an economy minister in Denmark, where she assumed a leadership role in Europe during the financial crisis. An economist by training and a skilled navigator of Denmark\u2019s multiparty system, Ms. Vestager was the inspiration for a political TV drama series in her home country. As a commissioner, her no-frills demeanor and her colorful, in part self-sown, wardrobe helped her stand out in the Brussels officialdom.\n\nShe will now remain the public face of Europe\u2019s new scrutiny of big tech. The threat of heightened regulation in Brussels, and more recently Washington, has emerged as a key issue facing the Western tech giants, dominated by American companies.\n\nEurope, largely under Ms. Vestager, has taken a lead role over policing Silicon Valley in recent years, despite not having many homegrown tech players. It flexed its globe-spanning sway most notably in a sweeping privacy directive last year that has forced companies inside and outside Europe to adhere to strict rules on data.\n\nWashington has more recently stepped up scrutiny, too. Two separate groups of attorneys general are investigating Google and Facebook. Federal antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have separately trained their sites on Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.\n\nWith some of these probes overlapping in terms of focus, Ms. Vestager said in the interview she \u201calways appreciated the cooperation\u201d with her American counterparts, without committing to seeking any. She said though that she will \u201cfollow with great interest what colleagues are doing on the other side of the Atlantic.\u201d\n\nAmerican tech companies have said they generally welcome greater oversight. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook last year in Brussels attacked the \u201cdata-industrial complex\u201d and called for tighter privacy regulation. Facebook has touted its new efforts to police the content on its site.\n\nIndustry watchers warned tech giants to brace for more European scrutiny under Ms. Vestager.\n\nThe commission\u2019s focus on \u201cdigital giants is set to sharpen further,\u201d said Alexi Dimitriou, competition counsel at Ashurst, a multinational law firm. \u201cWith her remit also expanding to coordinating wider digital policies, digital business should expect regulatory intensity to continue,\u201d he said.\n\nPhil Hogan is slated to take over the bloc\u2019s top trade post, where he will be responsible for negotiating future trade deals with the U.K. after Brexit.

She also blocked the merger of the railway businesses of Germany\u2019s Siemens AG and France\u2019s Alstom SA, despite calls from Paris and Berlin for the creation of a European champion that politicians hoped would be able to take on Chinese competitors.\n\nIn another key economic appointment in Brussels, Ireland\u2019s Phil Hogan was nominated to take over the bloc\u2019s top trade post, where he will be responsible for negotiating future trade deals with the U.K. after Brexit, and with the U.S. Mr. Hogan, currently commissioner for agriculture, has been a tough critic of Brexit and the U.K.\n\nMr. Hogan will also inherit the looming threat of car tariffs, in addition to duties on billions of dollars of EU exports that the Trump administration has readied in a long-running U.S.-EU dispute over aircraft subsidies.\n\n\u2018Tax Lady\u2019 Staying Put in Brussels Margrethe Vestager, attacked by both Obama and Trump administrations, to remain as Europe\u2019s top competition cop Born: April 13, 1968, in Glostrup, Denmark\n\nApril 13, 1968, in Glostrup, Denmark Background: Danish politician, including a stint as Denmark\u2019s economics minister\n\nDanish politician, including a stint as Denmark\u2019s economics minister Old job: European Commission competition chief, in charge of anticompetition policy and enforcement\n\nEuropean Commission competition chief, in charge of anticompetition policy and enforcement New job: She has been nominated for five more years, in addition to taking on a new role as executive deputy in charge of the digital economy\n\nShe has been nominated for five more years, in addition to taking on a new role as executive deputy in charge of the digital economy Education: Studied economics at the University of Copenhagen\n\nStudied economics at the University of Copenhagen Career milestone: Ms. Vestager is the first competition commissioner to be nominated for a second term and have her tasks extended to new regulation in the digital sector\n\nMs. Vestager is the first competition commissioner to be nominated for a second term and have her tasks extended to new regulation in the digital sector Big probes:\n\n\u2014Three investigations into Alphabet\u2019s Google, ending with record fines;\n\n\u2014Ordered Ireland to claw back $15 billion from Apple in what the commission ruled were unpaid taxes.
