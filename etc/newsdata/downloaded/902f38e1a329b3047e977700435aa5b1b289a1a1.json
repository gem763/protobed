She said: 'I followed the vehicle and turned into a McDonalds car park where it parked.'\n\nPC Tom Stark (pictured left) told the inquest that he climbed over the four meter high wall but stopped chasing Mr Hillier after he believed he had crossed an electrified railway line. Detective Inspector Kate Gunson (pictured right at the inquest today) said a police dog unit was called in which picked up a scent but this was soon lost\n\nPC Franklin approached the vehicle and tapped on the window and tried to open the door handle. She noticed that he had something in his lap and when she opened the door she smelt cannabis.\n\n'At that point I became concerned there were drugs in the vehicle. Reece was very nervous he was physically shaking. He was really really nervous.\n\n'I said I could smell cannabis which he denied.\n\n'It was at that point I put him in handcuffs, he was severely shaking and I could feel that through the handcuffs.'\n\nThe officer then searched Mr Hillier and radioed in to colleagues for assistance as she wanted to search the vehicle but would need help to do so.\n\nMr Hillier, who had taken cocaine and cannabis, overheard her conversation and began struggling with the officer.\n\nPC Franklin said that she pursued Mr Hillier but had felt it was unsafe for her to climb over a high wall to follow him.\n\nShe said that her colleague, PC Tom Stark, continued the pursuit while she returned to secure the car and found two phones, a knife and cannabis inside.\n\nPC Stark told the inquest that he climbed over the 4m-high wall but stopped chasing Mr Hillier after he believed he had crossed an electrified railway line.\n\nDetective Inspector Kate Gunson said a police dog unit was called in which picked up a scent but this was soon lost and added a police helicopter used heat sensors to search the area but no trace of Mr Hillier was found.\n\nThe inquest heard that the body of Mr Hillier, with handcuffs still on, was found on March 17 in the River Itchen at Woodmill Outdoor Activity Centre by Daniel Hall who had been magnet fishing for scrap metal.\n\nA post-mortem showed he had cannabis and cocaine in his system.\n\nCoroner Grahame Short said he believed Mr Hillier either entered the river to avoid detection by the police dogs or had fallen into the water in the darkness as he fled the police.\n\nTributes were placed near the spot where Reece Hillier's body was found in the River Ichen in Southampton. He had been handcuffed by police before he died, an inquest heard today\n\nCoroner Grahame Short said: 'I cannot determine where Mr Hillier went once on the other side of the railway tracks. The search of the university campus grounds that were on that side of the railway was fruitless.'\n\nMr Short continued: 'I cannot say why he chose to enter the water, whether he fell in or tried to cross I do not know.\n\n'I am sure that he made that decision because he knew he knew he was being pursued by the police.\n\n'I find that he entered the water but couldn't get out and that was at least in part due to the fact his hands were bound.'\n\nTributes to Reece Hillier, whose family are angry at the circumstances of his death. A family statement read out today said: 'The fact Reece lay undiscovered for nine weeks will haunt us forever'\n\nHe added: 'I am afraid Reece died alone, unable to get out of the water. This was a tragic outcome.\n\n'The reason he came to be in the river was due to his own actions. I am desperately sorry for his family, his friends, and I wish to express my sympathies to you all.'\n\nMr Short found that the police had made enquiries in the weeks following Mr Hillier's escape and the fact that he was recorded as missing, rather than wanted had no 'practical' effect on the outcome.\n\nMr Hillier's mother, Lisa Lawler made a number of statements to police saying she was concerned something 'tragic' might have happened to her son.\n\nDetective Inspector Kate Gunson who led the investigation said: 'Two officers have had additional training as a result of this incident.\n\nReece Hillier, 22, (pictured) was found dead in the River Itchen in Southampton more than two months after he got away from officers during a drugs probe\n\n'It was, and is, force policy that if a family member wants to report someone as missing then a missing persons report should be made, regardless of they were a wanted suspect or not.\n\n'Regretfully it appears this did not happen on this occasion.'\n\nPathologist Dr Basil Purdue found the body had been in the water for a prolonged period of time: 'There was no way to know whether there had been drowning because of the state of decomposition.'\n\n'The cause of death is unascertained. We cannot tell whether or not he entered the water alive or not but there was no evidence that suggested he had been beaten up or assaulted before his death.'\n\nA statement made by Mr Hiller's family read: 'Reece was an energetic and lively character from childhood to adulthood. His personality could light up a room. Always dancing and singing, he loved music and was very talented.\n\n'As Reece got older he made some poor life choices but he had a good heart.\n\n'His decision to try and escape the police cost him his life and it broke all our families hearts. The fact Reece lay undiscovered for nine weeks will haunt us forever.\n\n'At no point in the nine weeks did the police show any interest in allowing us to report him missing. Reece has left behind a young son and a heartbroken family.'", "description": "Reece Hillier, 22, was stopped by police after he jumped a red light in Southampton, Hampshire on the evening of January 12.
