They stressed \u2026 action and support are integral in terms of ambition, and the ambition of support by developed countries should match the ambition of action by developing countries,\" it said.\n\nThe statement stressed that \"Developed countries shall provide new and additional, sustained, predictable, adequate and timely finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries, open markets and carry out practical technological cooperation, which serve the basis for mutual trust and important conditions for the comprehensive and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement\".", "description": "The BASIC bloc countries reaffirmed their commitment to multilateralism to address climate change and urged developed countries to close \"substantial\" gaps in their support to the Third World at the conclusion of a two-day conference held ahead of this years' United Nations climate conference.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/27/5db52a12a310cf3e97a319ea.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
