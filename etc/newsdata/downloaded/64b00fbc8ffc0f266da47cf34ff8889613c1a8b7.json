The Kurds, an ethnic group in a region that encompasses parts of Iraq, Syria and Turkey, are primarily Muslim. There is a considerable Christian population in the affected area of northeast Syria \u2014 estimated at around 40,000 by Peter Burns of the Washington-based In Defense of Christians, including members of the Syriac Orthodox church, the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East \u2014 but not much evangelical presence either in established congregations or as missionaries.\n\nBut there are larger geopolitical issues in play. Turkey\u2019s fraught relationship with the Kurds has long been a source of tension with the U.S. There are around 35 million Kurds spread across the Middle East, a third of them in Turkey. Their long struggle to establish a national state would threaten Turkish sovereignty over a considerable swath of territory, and Turkey considers their formidable guerrilla army terrorists.\n\nMeanwhile the Kurds have earned, and cultivated, an image in the West as loyal American allies against ISIS. They have good relations with Israel, a country which evangelicals fervently support. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose main interest is in countering Iranian influence on his country\u2019s borders, issued a strong condemnation of the Turkish invasion and a warning \u201cagainst the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds by Turkey and its proxies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael is prepared to extend humanitarian assistance to the gallant Kurdish people,\u201d he added.", "description": "", "authors": ["Yahoo News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
