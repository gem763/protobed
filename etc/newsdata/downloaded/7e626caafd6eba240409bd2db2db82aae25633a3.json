She has always denied these claims.\n\nThe Crazy Rich Asians star explained that when the media \"stereotypes\" and \"separates\" women, it enables men to remain superior in society.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It's about the scarcity, not gender.\"\n\nMs Wu explained that the \"really special\" thing about working on Hustlers \u2013 a crime drama based on a 2015 New York Magazine article called \"The Hustlers at Scores\" by Jessica Pressler \u2013 was that \"nobody was fighting about the one seat at the table\".\n\n\"I really think that is why patriarchy tries to separate us because they know that when we're together there is nothing more strong and powerful,\" she said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
