Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put a racial spin Wednesday on climate change and hurricanes, attributing emissions from \u201cpredominantly white\u201d corporations and communities for juicing recent storms that cost \u201cpredominantly black and brown lives\u201d in Louisiana and Puerto Rico.\n\nEven as House Republicans argued that cheap electricity from fossil fuels has helped lift more than a billion people out of poverty around the world, the New York Democrat asked a witness about whether \u201cthe Global South and communities of color\u201d bear the brunt of climate \u201chavoc.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he people that are producing climate change, the folks that are responsible for the largest amount of emissions, or communities, or corporations, they tend to be predominantly white, correct?\u201d she asked at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties.\n\nThe National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Mustafa Ali replied that \u201cyes, and every study backs that up I know no one is intentionally trying to kill people and hurt people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy own grandfather died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria,\u201d said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, referring to the 2017 Puerto Rico storm that ultimately left about 3,000 dead. \u201cWe can\u2019t act as though the inertia and history of colonization doesn\u2019t play a role in this.\u201d\n\nRep. Chip Roy, Texas Republican, pointed out that the deadliest hurricane in North American history remains the 1900 Great Galveston Storm, which killed between 6,000 and 12,000 people, making landfall well before the rise of atmospheric carbon-dioxide emissions.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, low-income communities will be the hardest hit if climate change initiatives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposed ban on hydraulic fracturing are enacted.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the massive violation of civil liberties that will occur if we do as Elizabeth Warren has said, and ban fracking,\u201d said Mr. Roy. \u201cLet\u2019s crush the American economy and crush the jobs not only in Texas but around the United States, and ban fracking in a fit of hysteria, undermining the very civil liberties of the Americans that depend on that affordable and available abundant energy.\u201d\n\nThe hearing was timed to the start of the ExxonMobil \u201cclimate fraud\u201d trial in New York, which began as a probe into what Exxon \u201cknew\u201d decades ago about climate change but morphed into an accounting dispute over the company\u2019s use of two sets of numbers to gauge the \u201cproxy cost\u201d of carbon and climate regulations.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this hearing seems to be to stir up a media frenzy and provide a story line for the current court case in New York, a case that isn\u2019t even about allegedly covering up the truth about climate change any more, but about accounting disagreements,\u201d said Mr. Roy.\n\nSubcommittee Chairman Jamie Raskin argued that \u201cExxon knew decades ago that climate change was real and would have devastating consequences if left corrected,\u201d but instead \u201cpublicly denied the reality of climate change\u201d by engaging in an \u201cextensive and sinister campaign of climate denial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people have been denied the power knowledge gives, which means they have been governed by Big Oil,\u201d said Mr. Raskin, Maryland Democrat.\n\nFormer Exxon consultant Martin Hoffert said the company \u201cdeliberately created doubt\u201d about the seriousness of climate change that contradicted its internal research, adding that, \u201cas a result, homes and livelihoods will likely be destroyed and lives lost.\u201d\n\nIn questions to Mr. Hoffert and former Exxon scientist Ed Garvey, Rep. James Comer, Kentucky Republican, established that Exxon\u2019s climate research was widely published and in line with what other researchers were saying at the time about global warming.\n\n\u201cThe New York attorney general and many other leading climate-change litigation efforts across the country would have us believe that the oil-and-gas industry hid key science for decades from the American public,\u201d said Mr. Comer. \u201cPublishing work that is consistent with academic research in scientific journals seems like an odd way to go about hiding anything.\u201d\n\nGlobal climate-related deaths \u2014 those from floods, hurricanes, drought, wildfires and other \u201cextreme weather\u201d events \u2014 plummeted by about 95% from 1920-2018, according to data compiled by the Copenhagen Consensus Center\u2019s Bjorn Lomborg.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, Kentucky Republican, said he knows from first-hand experience that moving to 100% renewable energy in the near future, as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has called for in her Green New Deal, would be expensive, particularly for the disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cFor the record, I\u2019m not against solar, I\u2019m not against electric cars,\u201d Mr. Massie said. \u201cI drive an electric car and my house is 100% solar. But I estimate that I pay about twice the cost for transportation and electricity, so this is not a burden we should put on low-income communities.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
