It involves civil rights, democratic proceedings, public administration as well as longstanding difficulties and dissatisfactions at individual and community levels, all of which entails careful, comprehensive assessment and handling. But for that to happen, there has to be calm and order.\n\nThat the US representatives have chosen to wrongly judge the situation in Hong Kong and are seeking dictate what happens by exacerbating the unrest, reveals the desire of US politicians of both parties to foment a \"color revolution\" in Hong Kong.\n\nThey are destined to be disappointed though.\n\nHong Kong's status as an international financial, trading and shipping center is the result of the toil and perseverance of its people with the strong support of mainland. It has never been and a gift granted by foreign countries, and therefore it is not something that can be withheld or taken back.\n\nThose US politicians holding high the banner of human rights in support of the chaos in Hong Kong, either willfully ignore or are ignorant of the truth that since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the people of Hong enjoy more extensive democratic rights and freedoms than ever before. And that these rights and freedoms are being denied people in Hong Kong by the violence of the protestors they support.\n\nBut then their banner is a very amorphous thing.", "description": "The People's Republic of China makes no secret about its sensitivity to foreign intervention in its internal affairs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/16/5da6b756a310cf3e97a17fb6.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
