When he\u2019s available, he is somebody who is very talented and I would be very open to talking to him.\u201d\n\nSmith abruptly exited Fox News two weeks ago after months of clashing with some of the network\u2019s overtly right-wing primetime stars. The daytime news anchor also repeatedly drew outrage from the president over his penchant for fact-checking the many unfounded claims of Trump and his Fox News allies.\n\nZucker suggested that Fox News had become an \u201cuntenable\u201d environment for someone like Smith, \u201cwho was a truth-teller who set out to hold people in power accountable. That is not something that organization does, that is not something in full force there, not even in half force.\u201d\n\nThe CNN chief also didn\u2019t mind pushing back on his own reporter\u2019s defense of parts of the network.\n\nAfter Stelter, host of CNN\u2019s media-focused Reliable Sources, claimed that while Fox is often driven by right-wing punditry, it does still employ serious journalists, Zucker offered his own media criticism of his media critic.\n\n\u201cYou repeat that line a lot and I think it\u2019s one of the mistakes you make in your journalism,\u201d Zucker told the star weekend host. \u201cAre there a handful of great journalists in that org? Sure. Are there are one or two really good anchors at that organization? Sure. But that doesn\u2019t make it a news organization, that doesn\u2019t make it a journalism endeavor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you often say there\u2019s a difference between the news side and the opinion side,\u201d Zucker added. \u201cI think that I don\u2019t see it that way, and I know that you report it that way a lot. I think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nThe CNN head, who previously ran NBCUniversal, continued to slam Fox News as being \u201cakin to state-run TV.\u201d He went on: \u201cI think it\u2019s morphed into conspiracy TV\u2026 I dont think it\u2019s a journalistic organization.\u201d\n\nAsked about the repeated attacks on him by Fox\u2019s conservative programming, Zucker replied: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t pay attention to it.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI think you often say there\u2019s a difference between the news side and the opinion side,\u201d Zucker told media critic Brian Stelter on Thursday. \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2280,w_4054,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571945448/GettyImages-1135018490_mhf07v", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
