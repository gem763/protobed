The cab of the lorry collides with the driver's side of the car\n\nThe HGV grinds to a halt as the silver hatchback is pushed along the stretch of motorway\n\nEventually the HGV grinds to a halt as the hazard lights of the hatchback can be seen flashing.\n\nThe driver, 30, who was travelling behind told MailOnline: 'I am unaware of any injuries that occurred.\n\n'I didn't stop after the crash as I felt I would have more of an obstruction than if I has continued on.'\n\n'Before the crash I had an inclination that it was going to occur judging by how close the car involved was to the lorry.\n\nHe added: 'After this it all went in slow motion and I watched it unfold. I was mainly concerned with preventing a further accident behind me as its a busy stretch of road.\n\n'Thankfully as its so busy it wasn't a high speed collision as I feel this could have ended a lot worse for the smaller car.\n\n'My advice on this stretch of road would have been to accelerate into the gap between the two and be more aware of your surroundings.'\n\nTransport for Scotland and Police Scotland recorded no reports or injuries of the incident.", "description": "A tiny silver hatchback and a blue HGV collide on the M8 eastbound at Charing Cross in Glasgow, Scotland on Tuesday 22 at 7.33am.
