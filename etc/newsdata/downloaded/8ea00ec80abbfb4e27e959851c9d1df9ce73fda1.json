REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk/File Photo\n\nWarren, a Massachusetts senator, is scheduled to visit with striking Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) teachers in the morning, according to her campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m standing beside them,\u201d she said in a video tweet on Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re out fighting for the future of our students - and I\u2019m with them all the way.\u201d\n\nThe teacher\u2019s union called the work stoppage last week after contract negotiations failed to produce a deal on pay, overcrowding in schools and a lack of support staff such as nurses and social workers.\n\nWarren, a leading progressive voice for the Democrats, is one of the top contenders aiming to secure her party\u2019s presidential nomination and face off next year against President Donald Trump.\n\nAbout 300,000 students have been out of school since Thursday when the system\u2019s 25,000 teachers went on strike.\n\nLate on Monday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called for the union to end the strike and make a deal with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS).\n\nAt an earlier news conference, Lightfoot said the city had made written concessions on pay and staffing and urged the union to show \u201curgency\u201d to reach a deal.\n\nThe strike is the latest in a wave of work stoppages in U.S. school districts in which demands for school resources have superseded calls for higher salaries and benefits.\n\nIn Chicago and elsewhere, teachers have emphasized the need to help underfunded schools, framing their demands as a call for social justice.\n\nUnion President Jesse Sharkey said during an evening news conference that Lightfoot\u2019s proposal only addresses 20 percent of overcrowded classes and her support staff proposals do not adequately meet the needs of the district.\n\n\u201cI find my hopes dashed,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless there is a change at the top of this city in regard to their willingness to make meaningful changes, we are not likely seeing a quick settlement of the current strike.\u201d\n\nLightfoot, who was elected in April, said the district offered a raise for teachers of 16% over five years, but could not afford the union\u2019s full demands, which would cost an extra $2.4 billion annually.\n\nAlthough the latest work stoppage has forced officials to cancel classes and sports events, school buildings are staying open for children in need of a place to go.", "description": "Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, is expected to rally with striking Chicago school teachers on Tuesday as a work-stoppage led to classes being canceled for a fourth-day in the third-largest U.S. school system.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443686035&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0TU", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
