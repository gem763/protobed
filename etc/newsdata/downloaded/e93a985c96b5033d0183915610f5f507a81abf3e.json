(Bebeto Matthews/AP)\n\nMore than a dozen Latin American countries agreed Monday to impose sanctions on individuals associated with corruption, money laundering, drug trafficking and human rights violations in Venezuela in a move designed to further isolate and eventually oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nEgged on by the United States and the opposition government recognized by more than 50 democracies, the foreign ministers invoked a NATO-like treaty called the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, also known as the Rio Treaty. It is rooted in the principle that a threat to one member threatens all members.\n\nOf the 19 signatories to the rarely used 1947 treaty, 16 countries, including the United States, voted to endorse the sanctions. Only Uruguay voted against it, while Trinidad and Tobago abstained. Cuba was absent, but it is an outcast from the Organization of American States, which sponsored the meeting.\n\nNo one was specifically named besides the reviled Maduro, but the diplomats said their vote means they will identify those deemed complicit with Maduro\u2019s government, investigate and prosecute them, and ultimately seize their assets and sentence them to prison.\n\nUnder the treaty, all the signatories are required to share information and work together to compile a master list of former and current regime members, as well as family members, to whom sanctions would apply.\n\nThough the diplomats stopped short of calling for military action, as the Rio Treaty would permit, they said it represents a big step in pressuring Maduro and his cronies in a way that almost a year of U.S. sanctions against more than 100 individuals have so far failed to do. For months, U.S. officials have said they believe Maduro\u2019s government was on the brink of collapse, but he has managed to maintain the support of most of the armed forces.\n\n\u201cThis starts defining the path forward,\u201d said Carlos Trujillo, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States, who participated in the meeting.\n\n\u201cImagine the families of the accused trying to get out of the country by getting on a flight from Panama or Costa Rica,\u201d he added. \u201cThis puts pressure on the regime it has not had for the last 10 months.\u201d\n\nThough the Maduro government remains recognized by the United Nations, the Organization of American States and more than 50 other countries recognize the opposition government headed by Juan Guaid\u00f3, the president of the Venezuelan National Assembly. Opposition groups allied with Guaid\u00f3 will be meeting with President Trump in Washington on Wednesday.\n\nBoth the United States and envoys representing Guaid\u00f3 are hoping to use the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly to put pressure on European countries to impose U.S.-like sanctions on Maduro and his associates. They believe that members of the Maduro government have used Europe as a place to hide money and protect their families.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s something very unseemly about allowing Europe to turn into a kind of resort area for regime bigwigs and their families, who have children, wives, mistresses in Europe, bank accounts, houses,\u201d said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. strategy. \u201cThe Europeans should not be permitting this.\u201d\n\nAs U.S. sanctions have increasingly targeted Venezuela, the country\u2019s economy has collapsed, malnutrition and disease have soared, and millions of Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries to escape poverty and starvation. So many refugees have left Venezuela that only Syrians form a bigger refugee crisis.\n\nMonday\u2019s vote was taken in a palatial hotel in Midtown Manhattan where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his entourage are staying. Half a block away is the office of the Venezuelan Consulate that was abandoned by Maduro government functionaries who were expelled, with the quarters given to representatives of the Guaid\u00f3 government.\n\nThe consulate, apparently after being ransacked, has been repainted, and Guaid\u00f3\u2019s envoys have hung some modest pieces of art and put a few plastic chairs in an ornate ceremonial room where officials can be interviewed before a backdrop emblazoned with the symbols of the presidency.\n\n\u201cThe one who has closed any door for negotiation, for elections, for national unity is Maduro himself,\u201d Julio Borges, who is Guaid\u00f3\u2019s representative for foreign affairs and head of the delegation to New York, said Monday. \u201cWe must use all the tools we have to push him.\u201d\n\nColombia has accused Venezuela of providing safe haven to \u201cterrorists,\u201d most of them guerrilla groups who oppose the government in Bogota.\n\nColombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque met with a group of his compatriots in the New York suburbs on Sunday, using the occasion to accuse Maduro of committing \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not only a dictatorship; it is a narco-dictatorship,\u201d he said. \u201cA dictatorship that has destroyed freedom of press, the institutions, has torn apart the people.\u201d", "description": "U.S. officials are using the big annual United Nations gathering to pressure President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, aiming to further isolate his socialist government and oust him from power.", "authors": ["Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Zu0iwbgAVowPeNZ6lldCmod-RLU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G26LCGG6MAI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
