For $9.95 per month, members could see a movie in a theater daily, even getting tickets for new releases. But even as new members flocked to the company, it struggled to make money. Customers began complaining about the MoviePass app not working.\n\nInterrupting MoviePass service in July, during the busy summer blockbuster season, was probably a bad sign for the business\u2019 future. Then, a cybersecurity firm discovered in August that MoviePass had accidentally exposed customers\u2019 credit card data.\n\nHelios and Matheson said its board had formed a \u201cstrategic review committee\u201d that would explore the company\u2019s options, including a possible sale of the company or its assets like MoviePass and Moviefone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe company is continuing its efforts to seek financing to fund its operations,\u201d it said in the announcement. \u201cThere can be no assurance that any such financing will be obtained or available on terms acceptable to the committee.\u201d\n\nMoviePass isn\u2019t the only ticket subscription service to fall. Its former rival Sinemia said in April that it was discontinuing its U.S. operations.\n\nSimilar services offered by theater owners seem to be more successful. AMC Theatres announced last month that its Stubs A-List program had more than 900,000 subscribers. The service allows members to see three movies per week, but only at AMC locations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "MoviePass is no more, unless its owner can find a buyer to revive the movie ticket subscription service.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/08/0/0/MoviePass-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
