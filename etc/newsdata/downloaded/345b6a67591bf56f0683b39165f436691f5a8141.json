But times have changed in our country, and I believe the moment has come for me to step out from behind the curtain. I want to speak honestly and from the heart -- regardless of the consequences.\"\n\nThe \"Judge Judy\" star believes the billionaire businessman would make a \"no-nonsense president.\"\n\n\"Our American family has been fractured in recent years. We\u2019re hopelessly divided, and a bitterly divided family cannot thrive,\" she said. \"The only way we can begin to come together again, I said, is if Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, becomes our next president.\"\n\n\"An independent, tough-minded businessman, he represents our best chance to bring America together again and begin the long national process of healing,\" Sheindlin continued. \"Unlike those on the far right and the far left who use their bully pulpit to divide us, he\u2019s a pragmatist, a man who has shown time and again that he knows how to get things done and cares more about results than ideology. That\u2019s a skill in short supply these days, on both sides.\"\n\nJUDGE JUDY TO BE HONORED WITH LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD AT 2019 DAYTIME EMMYS\n\nThe star called the 2020 election the most divisive in our country's history and feels Bloomberg is the \"only person out there who seems to understand that screaming at one another gets us nowhere.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg has previously said that he does not intend to run for president. In March 2019, he wrote a column on Bloomberg.com starting he would not be entering the race.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It\u2019s essential that we nominate a Democrat who will be in the strongest position to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country back together. We cannot allow the primary process to drag the party to an extreme that would diminish our chances in the general election and translate into \u201cFour More Years,'\" he wrote.\n\nBloomberg served as mayor for three terms from 2002 to 2013.", "description": "Judge Judy\u00a0Sheindlin is speaking out about her political views in a new op-ed.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/28/694940094001_5972675913001_5972671801001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
