The sun is setting behind the world-famous silhouette of Table Mountain. A plane on its way to Cape Town\u2019s international airport flies low overhead. Children play on a rusting climbing frame, jumping on an abandoned mattress.\n\nReitz has only just returned to his home in the poor and violent neighbourhood of Bonteheuwel after five years in jail for a firearms offence. He is a member of the Americans, one of the area\u2019s biggest and most violent criminal gangs. On his wrist is the tattoo that marks him out as also being a member of one of South Africa\u2019s major prison gangs. Yards away, police search a line of teenagers turned to a wall.\n\nYou can be a tourist in the centre of Cape Town and be totally safe. But 10km away people are shooting at police Albert Fritz\n\n\u201cThis is our territory,\u201d says Reitz, 34. \u201cLife is tough here but we have no problem with the police. They keep it stable. That is better for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe police deployment in Bonteheuwel is part of a new effort by local authorities to stem soaring rates of violent crime on the Cape Flats, a vast sprawl inland of Cape Town that feels a world away from the beaches, restaurants and tourist sites on the other side of the mountain.\n\nFew doubt the scale of the problem.\n\nBonteheuwel in the Cape Flats\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bad year \u2013 but a really bad five years,\u201d says Simone Haysom, author of a book on gang violence in Cape Town. \u201cUntil now, the government seems to have been willing to let the Cape Flats burn.\u201d\n\nAfter almost 1,000 murders in the first six months of this year alone on the Cape Flats, national authorities sent in the army, and armoured convoys have patrolled the rutted streets of the area\u2019s worst neighbourhoods of the Cape Flats since July. The deployment was extended by South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in September.\n\nQ&A What is South African cities week? Show Hide Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope. Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town's spectacular beaches and trendy cafes. Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the \"other Soweto\", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper. Nick Van Mead\n\nThe police patrolling in Bonteheuwel are from one of two freshly constituted units of Cape Town\u2019s Metro force that are dispatched to some of the worst areas.\n\n\u201cThe community is tired of the gangs, and criminals think twice if they see us in the area,\u201d says the inspector who leads the team.\n\nThrough the evening and night, he and his dozen officers, all recruited locally, will stop and search a score of teenagers, raid a shattered, destitute house used solely by local drug addicts and search for firearms in squalid huts. Walls in the neighbourhood are marked with graffiti showing which gang is in control of each block.\n\nBonteheuwel was constructed in the 1960s by the repressive, racist apartheid regime that ruled South Africa until 1994. Apartheid planners purged Cape Town of black and mixed-race communities, dumping them in townships built without amenities or transport links on the sandy Cape Flats. Gangs developed rapidly from the mid-1990s onwards, recruiting among unemployed youth.\n\nStreet scenes in Nyanga\n\nAs violent crime has risen across South Africa since 2011, so too has gang violence on the Cape Flats.\n\n\u201cThere are more criminal networks in South Africa now, more foreign networks and more criminal businesses,\u201d says Haysom.\n\nStatistics released in September show a total of 21,022 murder cases in South Africa reported between 1 April 2018 and 31 March this year, a 3.4% increase from the previous reporting period, leaving the country with one of the highest murder rates in the world. The worst police precinct in the country, Nyanga, is close to Bonteheuwel.\n\nThere has been a large reduction in gang violence in Bonteheuwel\n\nCape Town is run by South Africa\u2019s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, further complicating the fight against gang violence. DA officials accuse the African National Congress, in power at national level for 25 years, of starving the province of police resources.\n\nAlbert Fritz, provincial minister for community safety, says violence on the Cape Flats has been very localised.\n\n\u201cIt is really a tale of two cities,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can be a tourist in the centre of Cape Town [and] you will be totally safe. You will not know that \u2026 10km [6.2 miles] away there are people shooting at police.\u201d\n\nSo far, the new deployment to Bonteheuwel has been a success. There were 44 killings in the first half of the year but there has been only one between June and mid-September; a hit on a gang leader.\n\nPolice patrol in Manenberg and Bonteheuwel\n\nBut a similar effort in Delft, a much bigger neighbourhood that lacks the strong community involvement that has taken place in Bonteheuwel, has had less impact, and there is little sign that the army deployment has improved the situation. By some measures, murders have increased.\n\n\u201cWe must not give up \u2026 I am optimistic,\u201d says Fritz. \u201cThe gangs \u2026 will always be there, but we can reduce their impact and power.\u201d\n\nOne of the most notorious neighbourhoods is Manenberg, a crowded series of low-rise apartment blocks and battered two-room homes where a series of gangs \u2013 the Americans, Hard Livings, Fancy Boys, Dixie Boys and others \u2013 fight to control a lucrative trade in cannabis, crystal meth and sedatives.\n\nOfficers from Cape Town\u2019s specialist anti-gang unit describe an anarchic free-for-all, with young criminals in their teens providing \u201ccannon fodder\u201d for wealthy criminals who live in big houses in sought-after suburbs well away from Manenberg\u2019s rubbish-strewn streets.\n\nBonteheuwel in the Cape Flats\n\n\u201cThe gangs build support among local residents by providing protection, handouts sometimes and keeping order,\u201d says one officer. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem for us. Everyone should be equal before the law, whoever they are.\u201d\n\nInvestigations into major gang leaders are often stymied by corruption and fear.\n\nWhy are South African cities still so segregated 25 years after apartheid? Read more\n\nRoegshanda Pascoe, an activist from Manenberg who witnessed a gang murder and agreed to testify against six men arrested for the killing, has faced attacks on her home and family. She has lived in a series of secret locations since the trial began, but has refused an official witness protection scheme that would have forced her to leave the region.\n\n\u201cI feel very hopeless,\u201d says Pascoe, 44. \u201cI will never be able to go home \u2026 But it\u2019s not just about people in Manenberg, or in Cape Town \u2026 it\u2019s about the whole nation.\u201d\n\nOn the eastern fringe of the Flats, where the spectacular wineries and resorts that draw wealthy tourists from all over the world are clearly visible, is Mfuleni, an expanse of makeshift housing that is poor even by local standards.\n\nAyanda Tunce: \u2018I am very worried about my kids and their future\u2019\n\nAyanda Tunce, known as 2SLY, grew up in Mfuleni. He spent 10 years as a gangster and five years in prison.\n\nTunce, 34, once wanted to be a doctor. As a teenager he was running errands for gang leaders and got a criminal record. At 22, he robbed a local drug dealer of two handguns and set up his own gang, selling drugs and maiming rivals. Now a father of three, he lives in a two-room shack with no sanitation and says he has rejected crime.\n\n\u201cIt is worse today,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery weekend round here, we hear someone is dead, shot, raped, stabbed. There is too much heroin and tik [crystal meth]. I am very worried about my kids and their future. I am not asking the president. He\u2019s got his own problems. It is only us who as citizens, who know our hoods, who can change things.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "After almost a thousand murders in the first six months of this year, armoured convoys have patrolled the worst areas of the Cape Flats", "authors": ["Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e678b858fc36977bab94f89c282db932fefe942/0_217_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8911c377361ed7f62e494d06df96a6a1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
