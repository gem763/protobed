While it is not launching a formal sale process, it is open to discussing ideas, including potentially selling a majority stake, the people said.\n\nThat could value the unit at 500-600 million euros (\u00a3432-519 million), they added.\n\n\u201cNow is a good time for potential buyers to get in touch with Aareal\u201d, one of the people said, adding pressure from activist investor Teleios Capital Partners had changed the dynamics of the situation.\n\nThe banks and Teleios declined to comment.\n\nFor Aareal, finding the right investor with expertise in software and property is more important than maximising price, the sources said.\n\nAn earlier attempt to sell a 30% stake has so far not borne fruit, but selling a minority holding remains Aareal\u2019s preferred option, one of the people said.\n\nIn a recent letter to Aareal, Teleios said an M&A adviser with expertise in large software deals would be best placed to manage a sale process.\n\nThe investor has threatened to call for an extraordinary shareholder meeting and a special audit if its demands are not met.\n\nAareal\u2019s chief executive officer Hermann Merkens earlier this month wrote in a letter to Teleios that Aareon was a \u201ckey pillar\u201d and that the bank was continuing to grow and invest in the division.\n\nBut Merkens also said the group was \u201cassessing all relevant options\u201d and had no established preferences.\n\nTeleios, which holds a 4.5% stake in Aareal, has said investors may be better served by a full sale of Aareon, adding the unit could be valued at 700 million to 1 billion euros.\n\nAareon\u2019s software helps professional landlords manage their properties and rental payments and lets customers to park rents with Aareal, giving the bank an inexpensive way to refinance itself.", "description": "German real estate lender Aareal is open to talks with potential buyers of its software business Aareon following calls from an activist investor to consider a sale, people close to the matter said.", "authors": ["Arno Schuetze", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
