The edits mainly related to whether those involved were \u201cprotesters\u201d or \u201crioters.\u201d\n\nOn the Mandarin version of Wikipedia, the article on the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre was edited to describe the event as \u201cthe June 4th incident\u201d to \u201cquell the counter-revolutionary riots.\u201d The Dalai Lama is referred to as a Tibetan refugee on the English version while the Mandarin version calls him a Chinese exile.\n\nLin commented: \u201cIt\u2019s control by the [Chinese] Government. That\u2019s very terrible.\u201d An investigation by BBC Click found almost 1600 edits across 22 politically sensitive articles designed to promote a controversial viewpoint or opinion. Jie Ding, an official from the China International Publishing Group, an organisation controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, argued in a paper that \u201cthere is a lack of systematic ordering and maintenance of contents about China\u2019s major political discourse on Wikipedia.\u201d\n\nDing\u2019s paper urges the importance for Chinese citizens to \u201creflect our voices and opinions in the entry, so as to objectively and truly reflect the influence of Chinese path and Chinese thoughts on other countries and history.\u201d Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told BBC Click: \u201c\u2018Telling China\u2019s story\u2019 is a concept that has gained huge traction over the past couple of years. They think that a lot of the perceptions people have of China abroad are really misunderstandings.\u201d\n\nTsui told BBC Click: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely conceivable that people from the diaspora, patriotic Chinese, are editing these Wikipedia entries. But to say that is to ignore the larger structural coordinated strategy the government has to manipulate these platforms.\u201d\n\nShirley Ze Yu, a visiting senior fellow at the LSE, commented on China\u2019s mass edits of Wikipedia pages stating: \u201cChina is the second-largest economy in the world and is doing what any other country in this status would seek. Today China does owe the world a China story told by itself and from a Chinese perspective. I think it\u2019s not only Chinese privilege, it\u2019s really a responsibility\u201d.\n\nWikipedia content moderators have often found themselves caught up in these political crossfires, with Lin stating: \u201cSome have told us that their personal information has been sprayed [released], because they have different thoughts.\u201d Some Taiwanese Wikipedians have also received threats as a result of their edits, one on the Wikimedia telegram Channel stated: \u201cthe policemen will enjoy your mother\u2019s forensic report.\u201d\n\nSilicon Valley tech firms have regularly relied on Wikipedia to provide information to devices, often resulting in issues for the firms. In June of 2018, Google blamed \u201cvandalism\u201d at Wikipedia for inaccurate search results which claimed that the California GOP promoted Nazism.\n\nRead more at BBC Click here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
