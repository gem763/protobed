Two years to the day after some of the deadliest wildfires tore through Northern California wine country, two of the state's largest utilities were poised Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, to shut off power to more than 700,000 customers in 37 counties, in what would be the largest preventive shut-off to date as utilities try to head off wildfires caused by faulty power lines. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 The Latest on power shutoffs in California to prevent wildfires (all times local):\n\n4:35 p.m.\n\nCalifornia's governor says residents should be outraged and infuriated by news of a widespread power shut-off to prevent deadly wildfires but that the utility had no choice.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday that Pacific Gas & Electric had to make the decision to cut off electricity as forecasts call for hot, dry winds that could spark wildfires.\n\nBut he said the company must upgrade and fix its technology so customers do not face anything like this again.\n\nThe utility is shutting off power to 800,000 customers in 34 counties in northern and central California starting Wednesday.\n\n____\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric says it will be setting up more than two dozen community centers with restrooms and electronic-device charging stations for people in counties affected by a power shutdown aimed at reducing wildfire risks.\n\nPG&E says it will open 28 centers across Northern California starting Wednesday at 8 a.m. They will stay open during daylight hours, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe centers will also have bottled water and air-conditioned seating for up to 100 people. They will be set up at fairgrounds, senior centers, shopping centers, in churches and other locations.\n\nPG&E says it will shut off power to more than 800,000 customers in 34 counties starting just after Wednesday at midnight.\n\n___\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nA Northern California utility says it will shut off power to more than 800,000 customers in 34 counties to reduce the risk of wildfire amid dry, windy conditions.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric says it expects to begin shutting down power in some areas starting just after Wednesday midnight.\n\nMichael Lewis, senior vice president of PG&E's electric operations, said it could take \"several days to fully restore power after the weather passes and safety inspections are completed.\"\n\nWindy conditions are expected to last through midday Thursday.\n\nSan Francisco is the only county not affected in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n__\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nResidents in California preparing for power shut-offs that could affect more than 700,000 customers are lining up at gas stations to fill their cars and buying generators, flashlights, ice chests and non-perishable food.\n\nJennifer Siemens lives in Oroville and says she is bracing for a third blackout in a month. She lost power twice after Pacific Gas and Electric cut power to thousands of customers to prevent its equipment from starting wildfires during warm, windy weather.\n\nSiemens says she is making sure they have bottled water, flashlights and all their electric devices fully charged.\n\nShe lost her home in Paradise, a town decimated last year by a fire that killed 85 people. The Nov. 8 blaze was started by PG&E power lines.\n\nSiemens says the outages are hard on her family because it scares their children, who were traumatized during the massive Paradise blaze, and affects their cleaning business.\n\n___\n\n10 a.m.\n\nWith windy, dry weather in the forecast, California utilities are considering shutting off power to more than 700,000 customers to try to prevent wildfires ignited by electrical equipment.\n\nSouthern California Edison's website showed Tuesday that more than 106,000 customers in parts of eight counties could face power cuts.\n\nThat's in addition to the more than 600,000 customers that Pacific Gas & Electric announced a day earlier could be affected.\n\nThe largest numbers of potentially affected SoCal Edison customers are in Los Angeles County and to the east in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n\nAlso under consideration are areas to the west in Ventura County and to the north in Kern, Tulare, Inyo and Mono counties.\n\nOn Monday, Pacific Gas & Electric announced possible blackouts in 30 northern and central counties starting Wednesday.", "description": "California's governor says residents should be outraged and infuriated by news of a widespread power shut-off to prevent deadly wildfires but that the utility had no choice.
