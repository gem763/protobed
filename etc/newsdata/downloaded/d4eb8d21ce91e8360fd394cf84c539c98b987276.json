On the field, I think he\u2019s helped us in a big way.\n\n\"Off the field, I think he\u2019s pushed me. I think he\u2019s made me a better coach, a better manager. And I think he\u2019s been a very good teammate and a good ambassador to the club.\"", "description": "The former Manchester United forward will join Derby County as a player coach in January", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Vaughn Ridley Getty Images", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658272.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DC-United-v-Toronto-FC-First-Round.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
