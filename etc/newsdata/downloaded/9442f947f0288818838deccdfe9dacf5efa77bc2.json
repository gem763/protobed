This is the situation. I think it's a wonderful World Cup. You can't help typhoons, we would all like to think we've got the power above and beyond what's on the world at the moment, but we don't and these things happen and you just ride with it.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If it doesn\u2019t and both teams are awarded two points via a scoreless draw, Scotland cannot qualify for the quarter-finals.\n\nHansen though admitted that while he feels for Scotland and Italy \u2013 who were in a similar situation albeit needing to record their first ever victory over the All Blacks \u2013 the way to avoid such cruel luck is by winning all of your matches.\n\n\"If you want to be really ruthless, then it's all about making sure you win the games on the way through because everyone knew this could be a possibility,\u201d the New Zealand head coach said. \u201cThat's pretty hard-nosed, though, because I know if we were in their situation, we'd be disappointed not to have the opportunity to get there.\n\n\"So yes, there's a lot of sympathy for them. But the right decisions are being made, because it's all about safety.\n\n\"It's always a risk at this time of year with the typhoons, but this is when we play the Rugby World Cup. If you play it earlier, you run the risk of people dying on the footy field because it'll be 40 degrees. If you play it later, then that's when we are finished for Christmas so you'd have Santa Claus giving us the World Cup.\"\n\nWorld Rugby are expected to make a final decision on Scotland\u2019s match on Sunday morning, when the worst of the typhoon is expected to have passed through the Konto area.\n\nEngland though did not hang around in Tokyo to find out how bad the worst typhoon of the year will be, with the squad immediately leaving their team hotel and hot-footing it to Miyazaki, where they held their pre-World Cup training camp on the southern island of Kyushu.\n\nPart of the reasoning for England\u2019s swift exit \u2013 on top of avoiding the biggest typhoon in 60 years to hit Japan \u2013 is to be near Oita where they play their quarter-final next weekend, but the other part lies on Jones\u2019s own experience of what typhoons can do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably been here for about 30 typhoons and some of them are just like a big thunderstorm,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut I can remember driving once in one of the first typhoons, and you know those convenience stores everywhere, the 7/11s, the 7/11 sign flew off and just landed in front of the car, so there\u2019s a reason why when typhoons come everything shuts down. It can be particularly dangerous and this one\u2019s supposed to be a big typhoon, so I don\u2019t see any other option that the organisers had. That\u2019s why we\u2019re not concerned at all about the comings and goings of it, we think it\u2019s the right decision.\n\n\u201cAt one stage I was looking pretty dodgy if it had kept coming. It was in Tokyo, September 1996. Driving to the ceremony for the first game of the season, I can remember it clearly.\u201d\n\nWith England\u2019s final pool game cancelled, they risk going into the quarter-final clash likely against Australia off the back of a 14-day break and undercooked for what will be their biggest match in Japan so far.\n\nBut Jones intends on running a full-speed training session in Miyazaki on Wednesday to ensure his players hit the ground running next weekend.\n\n\"We\u2019ll have a game simulation but we do that every Wednesday if we're not playing, or on the Saturday,\u201d he added. \u201cSo there's nothing different for us.\n\n\"It's the only preparation we\u2019ve got, so it's the best preparation. It is a great opportunity for us to regenerate, refocus, put a bit more petrol in the tank, so we're really happy with it.\n\n\"Joe Marler, Jack Nowell and Billy Vunipola are still on rehab, so they are still coming back. They are expected to be running fully, at least two of them, by Saturday.\"", "description": "Eddie Jones and Steve Hansen united in showing little sympathy for Scotland if Super Typhoon Hagibis knocks them out of the Rugby World Cup, with the England\u00a0and New Zealand coaches insistent that they are only in such a position because they lost their opening match.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/16/Eddie-Jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
