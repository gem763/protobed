Despite the risk, though, there's also still opportunity to profit from owning the right companies.\n\nJobs numbers in the U.S. remain strong. GDP growth is expected to end this year at 2.3%, then slow in 2020, but still remain above 2% -- not negative at all. And in the event a recession does not occur, 86% of the time, says Mossavar-Rahmani, stocks continue to go up!\n\nSo which stocks does Goldman Sachs recommend that you buy \"just in case?\"\n\nUtilizing the Stock Screener at TipRanks, We've found three stocks receiving \"buy\" ratings from most analysts in general, and endorsed by Goldman Sachs in particular. Let's take a closer look:\n\nStitch Fix (SFIX)\n\nStitch Fix is a clothing by mail subscription service, mailing its customers monthly deliveries of clothes, shoes, and accessories, which customers can then peruse and either accept (and pay for) or mail back (and not). But while the business model may bear a whiff of \"Columbia House CDs,\" it's doing a whole lot better than its predecessor in concept.\n\nWith profit margins intact, guiding for 11% to 13% EBITDA margins, 5-star Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry sees SFIX stock as attractively priced \"below the ecommerce sector average despite faster revenue and EBITDA growth.\" Terry rates Stitch Fix a 'buy' with a $24 price target -- implying 20% upside from today's prices. (To watch Terry's track record, click here)\n\nTerry points out, Stitch Fix nailed analyst estimates with sales of $432 million. Adjusted for a slightly longer quarter than Q4 2018 had in it, the analyst says grew 26% year over year, and management's \"FY20 revenue guidance of +20.5% -22.5% ... bracketed consensus\" expectations as well.\n\nClient rolls are expanding at a \"stable\" rate, \"spend per client\" is also growing nicely, and the company is expanding its business both internationally (to the UK) and categorically, as Stitch Fix promotes subscriptions for children's clothing.\n\nWhen looking at Wall Street\u2019s stance, Terry is not the only bull, as TipRanks analytics showcase SFIX as a Buy. Out of 9 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 5 rate SFIX a 'buy', while 4 say 'hold'. The 12-month average price target stands at $26.89 marking an 37% upside from where the stock is currently trading.
