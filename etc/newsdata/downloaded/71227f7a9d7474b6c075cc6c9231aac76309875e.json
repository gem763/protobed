Dyson said \u201cas many of the team as possible\u201d would be reassigned to other roles in the company.\n\nSingapore government agency the Economic Development Board predicted the decision to ditch the project would have a minimal disruption on Dyson\u2019s operations in the Asian trading hub, as it was at an early stage.\n\n\u2013 Tough project \u2013\n\nIn May, Dyson unveiled brief details of patents filed for the electric car and said it would be more energy-efficient than rivals \u2014 and with \u201cvery large wheels\u201d for city and rough-terrain driving.\n\nBut analysts were sceptical about the plan and not surprised about the change of heart.\n\n\u201cFrom the first instance it was always difficult to understand why Dyson thought that it would have any sort of competitive advantage in actually embarking on this project,\u201d Walter Theseira, a transport economist at Singapore University of Social Sciences, told AFP.\n\n\u201cGiven the global competitive landscape, you\u2019re adding a new manufacturer which is untested in the car industry.\u201d\n\nNitin Pangarkar, from National University of Singapore\u2019s Business School, added the car industry was becoming \u201cless attractive\u201d as cities create better public transport networks and consumers change behaviour through steps such as sharing rides.\n\n\u201cDyson\u2019s resources\u2026 are probably better spent elsewhere, in products similar to its current businesses,\u201d he added.\n\nElectric vehicles are increasing in popularity as governments worldwide seek to phase out polluting petrol and diesel cars, but producing them profitably is a challenge even for leading manufacturers.\n\nWhile Tesla has strong consumer appeal, investors have been frustrated by the pace of production and the company\u2019s inability to hit its financial targets.\n\nDespite dumping the project, Dyson insisted the company would continue a $3.1 billion investment programme in new technology, including the manufacture of batteries, robotics, machine learning and AI.\n\nThe company in May completed the move of its headquarters to Singapore, where many international firms have their Asian bases, and Dyson has since made headlines by going on a property-buying spree.\n\nHe reportedly paid Sg$74 million ($54 million) for Singapore\u2019s biggest, most expensive penthouse \u2014 a three-floor residence with a rooftop terrace and jacuzzi.\n\nAnd the tycoon also bought a luxury house complete with an indoor waterfall, spiral staircase, landscaped garden and infinity pool, according to local media.\n\nburs-sr/aph", "description": "Singapore (AFP) \u2013 British inventor James Dyson has dropped out of the race to produce electric cars in the face of stiff competition and after", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/3ab92d_british-industrial-design-engineer-james-dyson-his-company-electric-car-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
