Carter Snead, the William P. and Hazel B. White Director of the de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture. \u201cHer work is a living witness to the unconditional love and mercy that lies at the heart of the Culture of Life. We are pleased to honor her with the Notre Dame Evangelium Vitae Medal.\u201d\n\n\u201cVicki Thorn\u2019s work has been a source of healing for women and men whose lives have been touched by abortion,\u201d said University President Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to the de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture for recognizing Ms. Thorn for her service to the Church and to the work of mercy on behalf of a Culture of Life.\u201d\n\nThorn, a certified trauma counselor and spiritual director, started Project Rachel in 1984 while working in the Respect Life Office of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. Since the first training workshop for a small group of attendees on Sept. 19, 1984, the ministry has expanded to the majority of dioceses across the United States and more than 25 additional countries around the world. Now overseen by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Project Rachel is a diocesan-based network of specially trained priest confessors, mental health professionals, spiritual directors, medical professionals and others who provide ongoing, one-on-one, confidential post-abortion care.\n\nThorn is the author of \u201cProgetto Rachele, il volto della compassione\u201d (\u201cProject Rachel, The Face of Compassion\u201d), published in 2009 by Libreria Editrice Vaticana, and is an internationally acclaimed speaker on the effects of abortion on women, men and families. With her husband, William, she was inducted in 2008 into the Pontifical Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. In 2009, she received the People of Life Award from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops for her pro-life service to the Church, and in 2017, Pope Francis re-appointed her as a Corresponding Member of the Pontifical Academy for Life.\n\n\u201cVicki not only championed the cause of post-abortion reconciliation and healing, she has lived to see it become an essential aspect of the Catholic Church\u2019s pro-life ministry in the United States and around the world,\u201d said Richard Doerflinger, retired associate director of the USCCB Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities and recipient of the inaugural Notre Dame Evangelium Vitae Medal. \u201cFar from resting on her laurels, she is now a leader in showing how the Church\u2019s vision of human sexuality is supported by the findings of medical science, helping young people to turn away from behaviors that lead to the tragedy of abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn awarding Vicki Thorn the prestigious Evangelium Vitae Medal, Notre Dame recognizes her important service of the Gospel of life,\u201d said Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades of the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend. \u201cShe has helped thousands of women who have had an abortion to accept St. John Paul II\u2019s invitation in Evangelium Vitae to \u2018not give in to discouragement and not lose hope.\u2019 Project Rachel reminds us all that the Gospel of Jesus, the Gospel of life, is also the Gospel of mercy. I offer sincere thanks to Vicki especially for assisting so many women and men to experience God\u2019s love and forgiveness and to become, in the words of St. John Paul II, \u2018eloquent defenders of the right to life.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cVicki represents the kind of creative, brave, kind, tenacious woman who keeps the movement strong,\u201d said Helen Alvar\u00e9, former spokesperson for the USCCB and recipient of the 2012 Notre Dame Evangelium Vitae Medal. Alvar\u00e9 concluded, \u201cShe puts the \u2018respect\u2019 in the \u2018Respect Life\u2019 brand.\u201d\n\nThe Notre Dame Evangelium Vitae Medal, named after Pope John Paul II\u2019s 1995 encyclical on life issues, is the nation\u2019s most important lifetime achievement award for heroes of the pro-life movement, honoring individuals whose efforts have served to proclaim the Gospel of Life by steadfastly affirming and defending the sanctity of human life from its earliest stages.\n\n\u201cThe Evangelium Vitae Medal is a wonderful expression of Notre Dame\u2019s deep and abiding commitment to the dignity of every human person, and is an expression of our vocation to build a culture of life,\u201d said Rev. Gerry Olinger, C.S.C., the university\u2019s vice president for mission engagement and Church affairs.\n\nThe 2019 Evangelium Vitae medal was presented to the Women\u2019s Care Center Foundation. Previous recipients include Mother Agnes Mary Donovan and the Sisters of Life; Congressman Chris Smith, co-chair of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, and his wife, Marie Smith, director of the Parliamentary Network for Critical Issues; Supreme Knight Carl Anderson and the Knights of Columbus; the Little Sisters of the Poor; the Jerome Lejeune Foundation; and Mary Ann Glendon, professor of law at Harvard Law School.\n\nAnnounced annually on Respect Life Sunday, the first Sunday of October, the Notre Dame Evangelium Vitae award consists of a specially commissioned medal and $10,000 prize, to be presented at a banquet on the campus of Notre Dame on April 25.
