Until a general election can be called, Britain is experimenting with non-representative government.\n\nIt still has a prime minister, the same political parties and the same loosely defined constitution \u2014 but don\u2019t be fooled, its Parliament has gone rogue.\n\nLast week, MPs derailed the Johnson government\u2019s Brexit initiative, and this week they blocked a general election for a second time.\n\nMore than three years ago, the British people voted to leave the European Union, and ever since the cross-party, \u201cRemainer\u201d majority has tried to stop Brexit from happening.\n\nWhile Theresa May was in power, there was still a veneer of democratic respectability. It may have been fake as she had no intention of fully leaving, but at least the system appeared to be working.\n\nOnce Boris Johnson took over and boldly proclaimed, \u201cWe are leaving on October 31, no ifs or buts,\u201d the pretense was over and \u201cRemainers\u201d spent their summer making plans to stop the government from governing.\n\nWhen Parliament reopened on Sept. 3, it would be anything but business as usual.\n\nEven as Mr. Johnson was giving his speech, one of his own MPs got up and walked over to join the Liberal Democrat Party. With those small steps the government\u2019s tiny majority of one was gone and that was just for starters.\n\nAgainst the government\u2019s wishes, MPs were then given permission by the speaker of the House of Commons to vote to extend the Oct. 31 leave date if the U.K. has not agreed a deal with the EU.\n\nUnlike the U.S. House of Representatives, the speaker in Parliament is supposed to be neutral, but Speaker John Bercow allowed MPs to vote knowing full well that the majority of them, like him, were \u201cRemainers.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, the vote passed, and because it is unlikely a new agreement will be reached before then, Brexit could be postponed again \u2014 this time until Jan. 31.\n\nRetribution was swift and the 21 \u201cRemainer\u201d Conservative MPs who voted against the government were sacked. Mr. Bercow then resigned as did others, including Mr. Johnson\u2019s own brother, Jo.\n\nThe rebels were now gone, but so was Mr. Johnson\u2019s parliamentary majority. To try to gain a new one, he wanted a general election. However, that decision is no longer up to a prime minister alone.\n\nSince 2011, when David Cameron introduced his ill-thought-through Fixed-term Parliaments Act, it requires a two-thirds majority to call an election outside of the set five-year term. But how can a minority government ever manage that?\n\nBoris Johnson tried twice and, unsurprisingly, was voted down in both attempts. The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, also refused to call for a no-confidence vote in him as that would have also led to an election.\n\nGovernments often cling on to power but keeping one there against its wishes is very unusual. Yet, it suits the \u201cRemainers\u201d purposes to see the Conservatives nominally in power but unable to overrule the opposition\u2019s voting majority.\n\n\u201cRemainers\u201d also know that if an election was called the Brexit-majority British public would vote many of them out \u2014 perhaps a great many of them.\n\nSo, the U.K. is now stuck with a minority government unable to get laws passed without help from other parties until 2022, or until it suits \u201cRemainers\u201d to bring it down.\n\nAmerica is used to sometimes having a divided government where one party controls the executive and the other party runs both sides of the legislature, but at least the president can get things done by signing an executive order.\n\nA U.K. prime minister can only pass laws with a voting majority. Until David Cameron messed the system up, if they no longer had one an election could be called. This ensured the U.K. had strong governments that ruled with the people\u2019s consent. Now Britain is effectively being ruled by parties that lost the election and Jeremy Corbyn is pulling the strings.\n\nOn Monday night, the longest-sitting parliamentary session since the English civil war was ended \u2014 although a Scottish court has now ruled even this decision of Mr. Johnson\u2019s was somehow unlawful.\n\nThat 17th-century sitting became known as the \u201cLong Parliament\u201d and was despised. Will this \u201cRemainer Parliament\u201d be similarly despised by history? After all, its last wretched act was to deny the people a general election.\n\nBoris Johnson is now a weakened leader and his administration is neither fully alive nor dead; it is a zombie government.\n\nHe recently stated he would rather \u201cbe dead in a ditch\u201d than ask the EU for an extension beyond Oct. 31. Does that mean he will make a \u201cRemainer\u201d friendly deal, or defy the new law and leave without a deal, or simply resign?\n\n\u2022 Andrew Davies is a U.K.-based video producer and scriptwriter.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
