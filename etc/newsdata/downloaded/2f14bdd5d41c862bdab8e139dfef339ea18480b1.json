I chickened out entirely,\u2019 she laughed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe admitted she didn\u2019t know if the show would last for more the one series, acknowledging in hindsight that it\u2019s \u2018still very much a part of the Saturday night routine.\u2019\n\nThe Vixen is one of The Chase\u2019s ruthless Chasers (Picture: ITV)\n\nReflecting on her feelings at the time, she said: \u2018I thought I was an alright singer,\u2019 but went on to say she doesn\u2019t think she was good enough.\n\nHowever, Jenny is adamant that her alter-ego, The Vixen, has helped her along the way.\n\n\u2018The way I\u2019ve managed to control my nerves is something that can definitely translate,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018At the audition stage\u2026it was the Vixen that pushed me out the door and onto the stage.\u2019\n\nWhile X Factor: Celebrity is being kept pretty under wraps, Jenny teased that fans \u2018will see a very different side of me.\u2019\n\nWe can\u2019t wait.\n\nFormer Love Island contestants Samira Mighty, Zara McDermott, Wes Nelson and Eyal Booker will make up The Islanders, and will be in the groups category for the show.\n\nAlso appearing are Towie star Megan McKenna, soap star Jonny Labey, and \u2013 possibly the best signing \u2013 legendary talk show host Ricki Lake.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon will be joined by Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger who are getting back into their judging seats.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nViewers are a little unsure of what to expect from the show \u2013 especially after some beloved segments have been abandoned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the new series viewers won\u2019t get to see with the boot camp stage or the incredibly tense six chair challenge.\n\nLouis explained: \u2018What we\u2019re doing this year I think is a brilliant idea. I think everyone\u2019s going to love watching these celebrities because it\u2019s not what people expect.\n\n\u2018Some of them are really good. The show feels more exciting. There\u2019s no Bootcamp, no Six-Chair Challenge, it feels slick this year.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been the best show on TV for a long time and has just had a little rebranding, I suppose, a new X Factor.\u2019\n\nGood Morning Britain airs every weekday at 6am on ITV1.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
