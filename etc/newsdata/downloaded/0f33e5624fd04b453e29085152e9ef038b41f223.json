Spanning 1,300 square meters, the three-storey store has been in the works since 2017 and is manned by 120 consultants.\n\nThese specialists hailed from various fields such as hotel, art, and aviation, and were able to tend to customers in multiple languages, Huawei said in a statement Monday. It added that store visitors would be able to access a range of services including device purchase, maintenance, and training. They also would be able to attend free courses covering topics such as photography, sports, and healthcare, while app developers could tap the expertise of Huawei's technical consultants.\n\nThe vendor's CEO of consumer business Richard Yu said: \"MixC World is a gathering place where fashion, technology, and liberal art meet together and Huawei Global Flagship Store will become Huawei's city living room connecting the consumers.\"\n\nSingapore to feel impact of China-US trade dispute if prolonged Tensions between the two economic powerhouses will lead to fragmented technology markets and, if prolonged, drag down Singapore's economy, says Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who urges both countries to find ways to establish mutual trust.

For example, its ceilings and walls used felt made of recyclable plastic parts, while tables used nanoboard that were touted to last more than 10 years.\n\nThe Chinese smartphone maker described the store as its first \"direct-sale store in the world\", but it currently operates 11 \"concept stores\" in Singapore, from which customers can purchase its products including the Huawei Mate 30 Pro and and P30 Pro.\n\nAccording to the company, its products and services are available in more than 170 countries and it has 16 research and development facilities worldwide, including in India, Germany, Sweden, and the US.\n\nHuawei early this month unveiled a new P30 Pro that shipped with Google's Android 10 mobile OS, despite a US trade ban that barred US companies such as Google and Microsoft from supplying technology to Huawei. Google last month said its license exempting it from the export restrictions still prevented it from supplying software for new products.\n\nHuawei, meanwhile, has been developing its alternative Harmony OS, which recently was described as \"completely different\" from Android and Apple iOS. Yu said at the company's developer conference in Dongguan: \"It is a microkernel-based, distributed OS that delivers a smooth experience across all scenarios. It has trustworthy and secure architecture, and it supports seamless collaboration across devices. You can develop your apps once, then flexibly deploy them across a range of different devices.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nHuawei 1Q revenue climbs 39 percent amidst US pressure\n\nChinese networking vendor has reported a 39 percent increase in revenue to 197.7 billion yuan (US$29.5 billion) for the first quarter of 2019, when it shipped 59 million smartphones and inked 40 commercial contracts for 5G globally.\n\nJapan telcos pull back sale of new Huawei smartphones\n\nCiting consumer safety concerns and uncertainty over Google's Android support, SoftBank and KDDI have delayed the sale of new handsets from the Chinese vendor, specifically, the Huawei P30 lite, which had been slated to hit the local market on May 24.\n\nHuawei's new smartphone operating system is 'completely different from Android and iOS'\n\nChinese tech company shows off its alternative to Android, promises products this year.\n\nMicrosoft's top lawyer: Trump's Huawei ban makes no sense\n\nHuawei ban is like preventing a hotel chain from buying beds, says Microsoft president Brad Smith.\n\nHuawei trade ban: US officials figure out how to handle Trump's U-turn\n\nUS companies will be able to get licenses to supply gear to Huawei, even though the trade ban remains in place.", "description": "In the works since 2017, the Chinese smartphone maker's three-storey flagship store spans 1,300 square meters and is manned by 120 consultants who hail from various fields including hotel, art, and aviation.", "authors": ["Eileen Yu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/30/5ae73679-b9fb-472f-b7f5-d898a0832269/thumbnail/770x578/3517402bfb143be6e00296144a6d8390/huawei-store.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
