Tech leaders said outdated computer systems, a lack of investment and a gap in skills and awareness threatened the health service. Health chiefs were told to urgently pump more money into IT security to protect hospitals' and doctors' computer systems. Imperial College London's Institute of Global Health Innovation raised the concerns in their White Paper on NHS Cyber Security. It said cyber attacks on hospitals can leave medical staff unable to access patient details \u2013 such as blood test results or X-rays.\n\n'Seventeen minutes to log on to my surgery [computer] on a Monday morning and if I get through a morning surgery without it crashing... sorry Matt, it's so true.'\n\nShe said a 'big shift' is needed and challenged the Health Secretary, asking: 'What can we do to speed things up?'\n\nIn reply, he said he was aware of the impact of digital health practice Babylon on patient lists, being a patient himself.\n\nHowever, Mr Hancock, MP for West Suffolk, was forced to pause as the auditorium filled with laughter and groans.\n\nWhen he continued, he said: 'The biggest frustration for me is just the low grade of most technology.\n\n'Now primary care is actually better than many hospitals, which shows how much more there is to travel in secondary care as well.'\n\nMr Hancock said 'of course' there has to be budgets for upgrades, before he replied to Professor Stokes-Lampard personal IT issues.\n\nHe said: 'Seventeen minutes to log on, that's totally outrageous, and Windows 7... I don't think that you can patch Windows 7 any more.'", "description": "At the Royal College of GPs conference in Liverpool, Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard also admitted her computer still runs on Windows 7, an operating system released a decade ago.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/16/20137666-0-image-a-41_1571929664955.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
