Sure, there are still people who prefer traditional Bluetooth earbuds with a wire between them; they\u2019re harder to lose and can last longer on a charge, the argument goes. It\u2019s a fair point, but it hasn\u2019t been enough to keep many of us from eliminating any and all tethers. Walk around any city, and AirPods, Jabra Elite 65ts, and Galaxy Buds are impossible to miss.\n\nOver the last year, we\u2019ve seen new wireless earbuds making significant leaps in battery life and connection reliability. The days of intermittent music cutouts are pretty much over.\n\nTrying to land on a singular best pick for wireless earbuds is a little impractical. If you own many Apple devices and AirPods fit you well, there\u2019s your answer. Similarly, Samsung customers might lean toward the Galaxy Buds for their deeper level of integration with Galaxy smartphones. Or maybe your biggest deciding factor is budget. Yes, the products listed below are on the expensive side, but stay tuned because I plan to take a closer look at wireless earbuds under $100 for a similar roundup.\n\nNote that there are some earbuds that I\u2019ve left out here (including the Bose SoundSport Free) because their manufacturers have already announced plans for updated models soon.\n\nBest wireless earbuds: Beats Powerbeats Pro\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro take many of the best things about AirPods and improve upon key pillars like sound quality, battery life, and fit. They can keep playing for up to nine hours of continuous listening, have easy-to-use physical buttons on each earbud (including volume controls), and offer a much richer music output with a wider soundstage and pleasing balance between treble, mids, and bass. Yes, there\u2019s an extra kick for the latter, but the Powerbeats Pro work great for all music genres and deserve to be used everywhere \u2014 not just when you\u2019re sweating in the gym.\n\nThe ear hooks provide a stable fit, and you\u2019ll hear much less \u2014 but still some \u2014 outside noise when wearing the Powerbeats Pro. You\u2019re always aware of your surroundings, but not to the point where it can prove annoying and force you to crank the volume, as can be the case with AirPods.\n\nOur review of Beats Powerbeats Pro Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Superbly comfortable and steady in the ear, even during intense workouts\n\nHuge soundstage for true wireless earphones\n\nRich sound with satisfying bass thump\n\nSweat and water resistance\n\nEpic battery life for the category Bad Stuff Laughably large carrying case\n\nThe treble energy can be fatiguing with long listening sessions\n\nWireless or USB-C charging would have been nice\n\nNot the most discreet look for office or casual environments Buy for $249.95 from Apple Buy for $249.95 from Best Buy\n\nTheir biggest downside is their bulky charging case (necessary because of those ear hooks) that\u2019s cumbersome compared to pretty much everything else on the market. It also omits any kind of wireless charging. It\u2019s not something that you\u2019ll want in your pocket, which might seem like a potential deal-breaker. But with their marathon battery life, you can leave home without the case for a good chunk of the day and keep jamming along \u2014 or just toss the case in your bag. At $250, they aren\u2019t remotely close to cheap, but the best things rarely are.\n\nThe cheaper default (if they fit): Apple AirPods 2\n\nApple\u2019s second-generation AirPods don\u2019t make any significant upgrades to sound quality, and their design is exactly the same as the originals. So if they didn\u2019t fit in your ears then, they won\u2019t now.\n\nBut there are small additions that you\u2019ll come to appreciate: wireless charging, hands-free \u201cHey Siri\u201d voice commands, longer battery life on calls, and faster switching between and connecting to devices. There\u2019s a reason AirPods have become so ubiquitous in recent years, and it\u2019s not just because of the brand that makes them. They\u2019re dependable, dead simple to use, and the sound quality has proven to be good enough to satisfy millions of buyers.\n\nBest if you already have workout headphones: Sony WF-1000XM3\n\nNoise cancellation will be the next major selling point for true wireless earbuds. Apple is rumored to be preparing noise-canceling AirPods for 2020, but Sony\u2019s 1000XM3 earbuds are here right now with impressive noise cancellation, great sound, and an effective ambient mode that lets you hear surrounding noise when necessary.\n\nOur review of Sony WF-1000XM3 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Noise cancellation in a tiny package\n\nExcellent sound quality\n\nClassy, sleek look\n\nLengthy battery life for true wireless earbuds Bad Stuff No sweat or water resistance\n\nCan only pair to one device at a time\n\nNo wireless charging\n\nCan\u2019t control volume from earbuds Buy for $229.99 from Amazon Buy for $229.99 from B&H Photo\n\nBut the M3s lack water and sweat resistance, which is a sacrifice that\u2019s hard to overlook when you\u2019re spending $230. Sony\u2019s continued refusal to let them pair with two devices at once also remains a point of frustration. Lastly, the M3s have been having some issues when used with Windows PCs, a situation that the company will fix with an upcoming firmware update.\n\nAfter a couple of mediocre earlier attempts, Sony came back and almost nailed it the third time out. As its competitors race to come up with noise-canceling earbuds over the coming year, Sony only needs to address a few shortfalls, and it\u2019ll be close to earbud perfection.\n\nBest sound: Sennheiser True Momentum Wireless\n\nIn our review, we described the Sennheiser True Momentum Wireless earbuds as having \u201cthe best, purest sound of any true wireless buds yet.\u201d That remains true today. They\u2019re a joy for the ears, but Sennheiser\u2019s extremely premium ($300) earbuds are foiled by a tendency to quickly drain when in their charging case.\n\nOwners have been reporting the problem for months, and it has yet to be fully resolved by Sennheiser. As such, since the charging case and reliable standby time are critical for true wireless earbuds, I can\u2019t recommend that you buy them.\n\nOur review of Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff The best, purest sound of any true wireless buds yet\n\nDurable earbud design and case\n\nComfortable\n\nGood microphone performance Bad Stuff Bad battery drain when in charging case\n\nNeed to have the case with you at all times\n\nFlaky wireless Buy for $299.95 from Sennheiser Buy for $299.98 from Best Buy\n\nOther contenders\n\nThe field of true wireless earbuds is larger than ever before, with high-end audiophile options, others aimed at runners, and many that aim to strike the \u201cgood enough\u201d balance.\n\nOur review of JayBird Vista Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff None of Jaybird\u2019s previous struggles with audio dropouts\n\nExtremely compact and lightweight carrying case (with USB-C)\n\nSound is very customizable with EQ that can be personalized to your hearing\n\nGood battery life at six hours Bad Stuff Easy to uncomfortably press the buttons into your ears\n\nOnly supports SBC audio\n\nCase only holds 10 hours of extra charge Buy for $179.99 from Jaybid Buy for $179.99 from Amazon\n\nI\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by the Jaybird Vistas. Whereas the company\u2019s previous Run earbuds were a disappointment, this time, Jaybird has come basically full circle and delivered a product with very few faults. They fit snugly and have a nice small profile, their charging case is wonderfully efficient and portable, and they offer extensive EQ controls for customizing sound to your liking.\n\nSome might be turned off by the fact that the Vistas only support the basic Bluetooth SBC codec and not even AAC, but they\u2019re tuned well enough that I don\u2019t notice any obvious quality degradation. To me, they sound very similar to the Jabra Elite 65ts \u2014 only in a more modern package. The biggest downside is that the Vistas lack any kind of ambient passthrough mode, which might turn off those of you who do most of your running outdoors.\n\nOur review of Jabra Elite 65t Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Reliable connection between earbuds\n\nHave held up well over the long term\n\nMany software features and different sound modes Bad Stuff Micro USB connector\n\nDue for a refresh over the next few months Buy for $169.99 from Jabra Buy for $169.99 from Amazon\n\nThey\u2019ve been the go-to alternative to AirPods for years, but Jabra\u2019s Elite 65t are getting a little long in the tooth to buy at this point, unless you find a great deal on them. (They\u2019re on sale often these days, at least.) A refresh is almost certainly due sometime over the coming months \u2014 USB-C, please \u2014 and not everyone finds them comfortable to wear. But since the start, they\u2019ve nailed the basics of a reliable connection, decent-enough sound performance, and satisfactory battery life. And Jabra has continually added new software features, including Amazon Alexa and extras like white noise and nature sounds for when you need to concentrate.\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy Buds Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Light, discreet, comfortable design\n\nLegit six-hour battery life\n\nTiny case with wireless charging\n\nBetter sound isolation than Apple\u2019s AirPods Bad Stuff Bass-shy sound doesn\u2019t rise above average\n\nFlaky Bluetooth connectivity\n\nPoor microphone performance Buy for $129.99 from B&H Buy for $129.00 from Walmart\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds have a discreet design and can last a long time on a charge, but their audio quality is fairly average, and they\u2019re awful for phone calls. As a throw-in preorder bonus with Samsung\u2019s phones, there\u2019s very little to complain about. But if you\u2019re thinking of buying them standalone at their normal price, well, that\u2019s a harder decision to justify.", "description": "The latest wireless earbuds from Beats, Sony, Apple, Jaybird, Samsung, and others are better than ever in 2019.
