Bolton was, after all, a leading architect of the Iraq war. He has waged a decades-long campaign to bomb Iran, and as things have gotten hairy in Venezuela, he has broadcast his ambitions to oust Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from office by any means necessary. His demand for a preemptive strike on North Korea made him the most unapologetic American warmonger in a generation and in recent months, his resistance to Trump\u2019s peace talks with the Taliban further marked him as a slavering dog of war.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe main problem with rewarding the president for sidelining Bolton is that he is the guy who rearmed and reloaded the warmonger in the first place. But there\u2019s no reason to be short-sighted about the matter. Balance the equation on both sides, and it\u2019s apparent that Trump has made the world a safer place. Thanks to his resolve, World War III will just have to wait.\n\nI attempt no facetiousness when I observe that for the first 32 months of his tenure, Trump has been a peace president. Oh, I\u2019ll concede that he lives to rattle his saber: He\u2019s threatened the Venezuelans with war, approved military strikes on Iran, menaced Mexico with U.S. troops and vowed to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea. He\u2019s dropped bombs on Syria and continued the deployment of the special forces adventures around the world he inherited. But as much as you might dislike Trump, he\u2019s avoided getting us into another war.\n\nI don\u2019t take Trump for a pacifist. Rather, he\u2019s an America-firster in the tradition of Sen. Robert A. Taft (R-Ohio), who advocated a staunchly noninterventionist foreign policy in the post-WWII era. It\u2019s likely that Trump absorbed the Taft line while growing up reading the New York Daily News, which echoed Taft\u2019s views, as press scholar Matthew Pressman surmises. The Daily News (which, incidentally counted Trump\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump, as a major advertiser) rejected the globalist ideal then in vogue and cautioned against exploring the world for foreign monsters.\n\n\u201cBetween 1946 and 1952, the Daily News editorial page and its politics column said dozens of times that Uncle Sam had turned into \u2018Uncle Sap\u2019 or \u2018Uncle Sucker,\u2019 because \u2018so-called allies\u2019 in NATO were raking in aid money from the U.S. and failing to pay enough for their own defense,\u201d Pressman writes. Like Trump today, the paper urged a retreat to a well-armed fortress America.\n\nOr, maybe Trump came by his foreign policy views as a Boomer who never recovered from the chronic bone spurs given to him by the national trauma that was the Vietnam War. Maybe he tilts toward the doves because war disturbs the business of business or because at his core he dislikes genuine confrontation. Or we can attribute his anti-war ways to his political naivet\u00e9. Unlike the usual politicians, Trump didn\u2019t come into political consciousness being lectured by lobbyists from the military-industrial complex or establishment foreign policy advisers. After 34 months in office, Trump might look at the globe as a game board, but his eyes see Monopoly, where problems are solved with \u201cdeals,\u201d not Risk, where diplomacy and armies settle things.\n\nNever was Trump\u2019s worldview on better display than the time he extemporized on the economic potential locked up in North Korea\u2019s beaches. Where another president might envision a terminus point for an AAV7 assault amphibious vehicle, Trump saw vacation homes. \u201cThey have great beaches,\u201d Trump said of the North Koreans. \u201cYou see that whenever they\u2019re exploding their cannons into the ocean. I said, boy, look at that view. Wouldn\u2019t that make a great condo?\u201d\n\nTrump confuses observers\u2014and probably confused Bolton\u2014because his embrace of the military and his fondness for the symbolism of war make him sound like the reincarnation of Gen. Curtis LeMay. It\u2019s an easy mistake to make. Remember how he cooed and cawed at the prospect of a military flyover in Washington after attending the Bastille Day parade in Paris and how proudly he beamed on the Fourth of July when he made it happen? Remember the joy in his voice in the early months of his presidency when he kept bragging about \u201cmy generals\u201d and \u201cmy military\u201d?\n\nBut the real Trump doesn\u2019t want to get any closer to a shooting war than playing with his children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s GI Joes during executive time. Scrape aside the bluster and the combat-bootlicking and you discover our first peacenik president. Or at least I hope so.\n\n******\n\nHe does, however, love trade war.
