One of the best I ever met,\u201d Mr Ryan said of the murderous autocrat, who was overthrown and killed in 2011. \u201cWe got on very well.\u201d\n\nMr Ryan had initially served as a Catholic missionary in Africa but by the time the Troubles started in the late 1960s he had become a parish priest back in Ireland.\n\nHe began giving money to the Provisional IRA, some of which was taken from the cash donated by his congregation to the church, and later quit the ministry to travel the world raising funds and buying arms for the group.\n\nIn 1988 he was caught in Belgium in a house with bomb-making equipment and cash and was the centre of a furious extradition battle between the UK and Ireland.\n\nIn the end, the Belgian authorities decided to send him back to Ireland, which then refused a request to extradite him to Britain on grounds he had already been called a terrorist in parliament, and would not receive a fair trial.\n\nSome Unionists have now demanded he be prosecuted for his admissions.\n\nTraditional Unionist Voice leader Jim McAllister told BBC Radio Ulster Mr Ryan if it was right to investigate British soldiers over alleged misconduct during the Troubles, the former priest should also be pursued to the full extent of the law.", "description": "A former priest has admitted helping the IRA carry out bombings \u2013\u00a0including the lethal\u00a0Brighton attack which nearly killed Margaret Thatcher in 1984.
