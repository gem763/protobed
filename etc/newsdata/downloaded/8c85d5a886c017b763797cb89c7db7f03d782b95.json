What do people really think of Choi Hung Estate?", "language": "en", "text": "Choi Hung Estate is one of the most instragrammed spots in Hong Kong. On weekends, holidays and after school, you\u2019ll finds congregations of teens taking snaps of the colourful residential estate, which was built in the 1960s to house Hong Kong\u2019s rapidly growing population.\n\nYoung people and photography lovers aren\u2019t the only ones enamoured by this eye-catching spot. In 1965, the Hong Kong Institute of Architects awarded the collection of buildings a Silver Medal for architecture. Over the years, the estate has also attracted a number of famous figures, including would-be US President Richard Nixon in 1964, and British Princesses Margaret and Alexandra, who visited in 1966 and 1967 respectively.\n\nZoe Fedoruk, a 14-year-old student from Saint Paul\u2019s Co-educational College, doesn\u2019t see the public\u2019s fascination with the estate ending any time soon.\n\n5 camera filter apps to give your photos that #throwback vintage 90s look\n\n\u201cWith the rise in popularity of photography thanks to photo-sharing platforms like Instagram, more and more people are going to Choi Hung Estate specifically to take aesthetically beautiful photos,\u201dshe explains.\n\nThe roads inside Choi Hung, which translates to \u201crainbow\u201d in English, have equally colourful names: Red Plum Avenue, Yellow Chrysanthemum Avenue, Green Willow Avenue, Cyan Willow Avenue, Blue Bell Avenue, and Purple Flourish Avenue.\n\nThe buildings, too, are marked with the Chinese characters for \u201cpurple\u201d, \u201cemerald\u201d, \u201cgold\u201d, \u201cred\u201d and many other dazzling hues.\n\nClaire Lee, reporter Veronica Lin, and Natasha Ho at Choi Hung Estate.

Is it really worth the hype?\n\nWe conducted short interviews with residents and tourists to gain insight on their views.\n\nCloudy Yun, 22, is a tourist from Guangzhou, who first discovered the Rainbow Estate on the video sharing app TikTok, and wanted to see it for herself. However, she said that she was \u201cslightly disappointed\u201d with how the estate looked in real life, saying it was different from what she had expected.\n\n5 apps to help take your Instagram stories to influencer level\n\nSome Hong Kong students agree that photos shared online of the estate don\u2019t always match with reality.\n\n\u201cWhile I personally think that Choi Hung Estate is a nice place for photos, and I can see the appeal of it, it\u2019s true that a lot of the photos we see online are heavily edited, to make the colours look brighter,\u201d says Kody Tang, 14.\n\nTop 10 places in Hong Kong to take an insanely beautiful photo - #nofilterneeded!\n\nOne 16-year-old American International School student, however, argues that the building \u201cis old, and the only thing special about it is that it\u2019s painted pastel colours.\u201d A 13-year-old student from Sha Tin College adds that \u201cafter some editing the photos taken there are nice, but it also annoys the people living there.\u201d\n\nFor one resident at the estate, a 55-year-old man who didn\u2019t want to give his name, this sentiment couldn\u2019t ring more true. He explains that on public holidays, as many as 200 people can be seen crowding the basketball court. \u201cIt is incredibly irritating due to the fact that it prevents people from playing basketball,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any allure of the buildings. For me, it\u2019s just where I live.\u201d\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "We talk about the history behind the popular photography location and ask the public how they feel about the \u2018rainbow\u2019 village.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/choihung1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
