Roughly a week prior to Brennan\u2019s comments, Barr and Durham spoke to senior Italian intelligence officials.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand the predication of this worldwide effort to try to uncover dirt, either real or imagined, that would discredit that investigation in 2016 into Russian interference,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nThe Department of Justice didn\u2019t respond to a request for additional information.\n\nThe FBI secured a secret court surveillance warrant in October 2016 to spy on Trump campaign associate Carter Page. While the extent of the surveillance granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is still classified, the warrant may have granted the FBI access to the records and communications of virtually every Trump campaign official.\n\nTrump granted Barr the authority to declassify any document he deems necessary as he investigates the spy operation against his presidential campaign.\n\nThe FBI used a Hillary Clinton campaign-funded opposition research dossier on then-candidate Trump as evidence in the warrant application. Former UK spy Christopher Steele composed the dossier, paying second- and third-hand sources with ties to the Kremlin. The dossier made it to the FBI via several channels, including a field office in Rome.\n\nBrennan told Congress in May 2017 that the dossier was \u201cnot in any way used as the basis for the intelligence community\u2019s assessment\u201d on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper later appeared to contradict Brennan, telling CNN that the assessment corroborated \u201csome of the substantive content of the dossier.\u201d\n\nClapper confirmed to Congress in May 2017 that \u201cEuropean allies\u201d passed intelligence to the United States about \u201cabout contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians.\u201d Brennan told lawmakers later that month that any information the CIA received was shared with the FBI. That intelligence eventually served as the basis for the bureau\u2019s counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, according to Brennan.\n\n\u201cI was aware of intelligence and information about contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons that raised concerns in my mind about whether or not those individuals were cooperating with the Russians, either in a witting or unwitting fashion, and it served as the basis for the FBI investigation to determine whether such collusion [or] cooperation occurred,\u201d Brennan said on May 23, 2017.\n\nBrennan has also confirmed that the CIA was scooping up intelligence on U.S. persons overseas and forwarding it to the FBI.\n\nAccording to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the intelligence the FBI used to open the investigation of the Trump campaign wasn\u2019t considered \u201cofficial intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe FBI investigation eventually evolved into the special counsel probe led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller. In March, Mueller concluded the investigation after 22 months, finding insufficient evidence to establish that either Trump or anyone on his campaign colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.", "description": "Justice Department to Question Brennan in Spygate Inquiry", "authors": ["Follow Ivan On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2019/10/03/GettyImages-959160476-1200x800.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
