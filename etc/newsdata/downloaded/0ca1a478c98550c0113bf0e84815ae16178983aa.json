At this level, she thinks everyone is good.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s tough, and at this level, all girls are well-rounded,\u201d Kunitskaya said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to see, like, she\u2019s good here or there. (I\u2019m) trying to prepare for everything. If it\u2019s for the standup fight or ground game, I\u2019m trying to be ready everywhere.\u201d", "description": "Yana Kunitskaya doesn't think a win over Aspen Ladd at UFC on ESPN 7 in Washington, D.C., will be enough for a title shot.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "George Garcia", "Simon Samano", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-yana-kunitskaya.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
