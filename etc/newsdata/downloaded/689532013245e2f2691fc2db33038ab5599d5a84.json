Britain, Get Talking.\u2019\n\nThe dad-of-one has previously opened up about his mental health, explaining that he sought therapy after Ant\u2019s drink-driving conviction last year.\n\nHis best pal pleaded guilty to a charge of drink-driving, and was fined \u00a386,000 and banned from driving for 20 months, after a three-way car crash.\n\nHe later went to rehab for a second time, after a previous stint in 2017.\n\nAnd, speaking about the incident, Dec told The Guardian: \u2018It\u2019s the most destabilising thing that has ever happened to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I had some counselling, and I still do. Just counselling. Therapy. It helps to talk to somebody independent, who doesn\u2019t watch or care about TV.\n\n\u2018We just sit and talk for an hour.\u2019\n\nFor more information on Britain Get Talking, visit itv.com/britaingettalking.\n\nNeed support?
