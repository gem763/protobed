Both are on the menu, which starts with homemade kaffir lime and peanut crackers with spiced peanut dip \u2013 a pan-Asian take on a poppadum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen comes a lightly fragrant coconut, prawn and sweetcorn soup, followed by satay chicken \u2013 again with a twist, this time a tang of tamarind and crunch of crispy fried chicken skin.\n\nNext, a whole seabass baked in a banana leaf, almost undetected under a pretty pile of spring vegetables and herbs, followed by intensely flavoured short-beef rendang and a prawn nasi goreng (Indonesian stir-fried rice). Both are lovely \u2013 presentation on point and full of flavour.\n\nThe pudding finale (there are three!) was a deconstructed peanut nougat satay \u2013 with chewy, nutty nougat kebabs, rich chocolate ganache and charcoal ice cream. The charcoal ice cream was a revelation. If only you could buy that in the supermarket.\n\nThe menu is generous \u2013 our main regret was not leaving an extra hour to move through the dishes more slowly \u2013 but it was such a treat not to have to choose what comes out of the kitchen, to sit back and get a glimpse of Asian cooking through Peter\u2019s eyes.\n\nIts location on Coin Street, just a few minutes from Waterloo and the South Bank, might suggest a touristy spot \u2013 but the night we went, it seemed to be more of an after-work or local crowd. It\u2019s relaxed and and staff are friendly.\n\nA great spot for a speedy culinary tour of South-East Asia \u2013 and for \u00a345 for 11 courses, you cannot get much better value. Well worth a visit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere to find it: Sticky Mango, 33 Coin Street, London SE1 9NR\n\nHere\u2019s a little flavour of what we ate from Peter\u2019s Instagram:\n\nHomemade kaffir lime leaf and peanut crackers, aka Rempeyel kacang\n\nThe whole baked sea bass\n\nThe pudding \u2013 grilled peanut nougat, chocoalte ganache, charcoal ice cream, chilli tuille\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Where to eat in London this week: Sticky Mango, Coin Street, SE1 You don't get many friendly, relaxed chefs in charge of 11-course tasting menus in central London - but...", "authors": ["Bar Fox"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chicken-satay-with-a-tamarind-tang-and-crispy-chicken-skin-07ce_1570209701.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
