That leaves Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opposition on 25%, while the Liberal Democrats sit at 18%.\n\nIt is a figure so dismal that the party is behind where Michael Foot was in the run-up to the 1983 election, according to the elections expert John Curtice of Strathclyde University \u2013 and would result in a Conservative majority of about 60 on forecasts prepared by Electoral Calculus based on October\u2019s polling. And this is with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party at 12%.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Foot in his Westminster office in 1983.

But it is forecast to win far more straight from Labour in Wales (where the Tories are ahead), Yorkshire, the north-westof England and in the West and east Midlands \u2013 where elections are lost and won.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Brexit deal has already landed better than Theresa May\u2019s did last November \u2013 which included a number of resignations from cabinet. The circumstances are different: when the 29 March deadline was missed that was the final straw for May after an extended period of Tory feuding.\n\nThe polling firm Deltapoll believes that Johnson is better able to rally the Conservative base. Joe Twyman, a founder of the firm, said: \u201cJohnson is trusted by leave voters in a way that May was not; our sense is that few leave voters will blame the prime minister for the latest Brexit extension in the short term.\u201d\n\nDeltapoll\u2019s research showed that 32% of the British public supported the deal, marginally more than the 29% that were set against it. Equally as significant, 39% were undecided \u2013 giving Labour something to play for if it could reset opinion with its warnings about the economic impact or lack of protection for workers\u2019 rights.\n\nQuick guide How is Boris Johnson's Brexit deal different from Theresa May's? Show Hide The new Brexit deal is essentially the old Brexit deal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a link to the full text. The backstop is replaced The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly. Consent Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years. The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge. That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020. Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not. Checks on border, ports and airports Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d. Future trade deals The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched. Customs Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods. No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use. Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above. A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed. West/east trade The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated. VAT EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland. Single electricity market The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change. Level playing field This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement. Lisa O'Carroll Brexit correspondent\n\nThe high proportion of deal undecideds underscores the volatility that remains a well-remarked feature of the political scene. During October, Conservative poll leads have varied between three and 15 points, making a hung parliament with the Tories as the largest party a very real possibility.\n\nA fortnight ago, the British Election Study \u2013 providing long-running research on voting behaviour \u2013 reported the two most volatile elections in postwar history were 2015 followed by 2017, where 43% and 33% of voters respectively opted for a different party than the one they had voted for in previous elections.\n\nUncertainty over Brexit will make election hard to call \u2013 study Read more\n\nThe argument is that traditional loyalties have been eroded by a series of shocks: the financial crash, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, the Scottish referendum and Brexit. But, despite what some Labour MPs were hoping for, it is hard to believe the latest Brexit delay represents a shock in itself.\n\nAn election, Twyman observed, would be \u201ca major gamble\u201d for both parties, but in Westminster Conservative MPs are keener. It is easy to find anxious Labour MPs sitting on small majorities \u2013 and even ones with larger majorities in inner-city seats who are fretting about the unambiguously pro-remain Liberal Democrats and the response to Corbyn on the doorstep.\n\nLabour insiders countered by saying the 2017 result showed that, in an election campaign, the focus should broaden from Brexit, and the party\u2019s anti-austerity agenda would again prove popular. The party\u2019s problem is that Conservatives are prepared for this too, having increased school funding and police numbers.\n\nCorbyn and other Labour figures have said they want an election once no deal has been \u201ctaken off the table\u201d. Against this polling background it would not be surprising, however, if the opposition party found more reasons for delay.", "description": "Dismal polling puts Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party behind where Michael Foot was in the run-up to the 1983 general election", "authors": ["Dan Sabbagh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa0ddd5d5a9b39edbf9a980b7ac61ae60ae854d2/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f81c9fd1db6e34d0c869a66fa691c509", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
