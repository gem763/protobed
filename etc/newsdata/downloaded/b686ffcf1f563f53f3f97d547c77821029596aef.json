How to kill time while you wait\n\n\n\n\n\nSAA confirms four domestic flights cancelled\n\nSafety concerns and irregularities at South African Airways Technical (SAAT) have affected both South African Airways (SAA) and Comair planes, operated by kulula and BA - with travellers warned of affected flight schedules and flight delays as a result.\n\nSAA has issued a statement saying some of its flight will operate later than usual, with contingency measure being put in place as it has had to \"recall some of its aircraft to undertake compliance verification in line with the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) requirements\".\n\nThis follows the same audit inspection by the SACAA at SAA\u2019s maintenance subsidiary, South African Airways Technical (SAAT) that has seen Comair needing to ground some of its planes.\n\n\n\nSAA confirmed four domestic flight cancellations, saying it has combined flights and deploy bigger aircraft to accommodate affected passengers reduce the impact of the grounding.\n\n(Supplied: SAA)\n\nComair puts contingency plans in place as some planes grounded\n\nTravellers are being warned about possible disruption to kulula and BA flights after the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) grounded some of Comair\u2019s planes due to irregularities at South African Airways Technical (SAAT).\n\n\n\nSACAA issued the grounding status after a recent audit of SAAT, as maintenance and technical service provider to Comair, which operates kulula and BA domestic and regional flights in South Africa.\n\nComair issued a statement confirming it has contingency plans in place as the \u201caffected aircraft may not be flown until the necessary corrective action has been carried out\".\n\nWhile Comair aims to minimise any disruption to its operations, it was unable to confirm the exact number of planes affected by the technical irregularities or the specific routes that face possible delays.\n\nIn the statement Comair says it will keep its customers updated and a quick scan of some of its busiest flight routes via its flight status tool did not indicate any delays or cancelled flights for today as yet.\n\nThese are the flights affected:\n\nMN504, Durban to Lanseria\n\nBA6400, Cape Town to Johannesburg\n\nBA6441, Johannesburg to Cape Town\n\nBA6200, Durban to Johannesburg\n\nBA6232, Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg\n\nBA6406, Cape Town to Johannesburg\n\nBA6413, Johannesburg to Cape Town\n\nBA6414, Cape Town to Johannesburg\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with SAAT to rectify the findings and getting our flights back on schedule as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nTravellers can check their latest flight status on the relevant websites \u2013 ba.com and kulula.com or if you have urgent enquiries can call 011 921 0222 for British Airways or 086 158 5852 for kulula.\n\n\u201cWe do apologise to our customers for any inconvenience to their travel plans and appreciate their support.

The safety and security of our customers and personnel is our foremost priority and is never compromised.\u201d\n\nOngoing issues with SAAT\n\nComair has previously complained about its use of SAAT, blaming the service agent for its poor on-time departure records. BI previously reported that Comair would be looking to setup its own workshops in co-operation with German carrier Lufthansa as a solution.\n\nThe company also self-grounded its Boeing 737-8 Max, following the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash and before the entire fleet was grounded globally after Boeing admitted it needs to fix the risk associated with an autopilot system linked to two fatal crashes involving its Boeing 737 Max 8 model.\n\n\n\n\"We maintain an IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) accreditation, ensuring the implementation of global best practice in operational safety. The company is also audited by British Airways International, the Boeing Company as well as the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA).\"\n\n\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
