The poverty rate in 2018 was 11.8%, a decrease of a half percentage point from 2017, marking the fourth consecutive annual decline in the national poverty rate. It was the first time the official poverty rate fell significantly below its level at the start of the recession in 2007.\n\nThe share of Americans who lack health insurance rose for the first time since 2009, according to the figures. In 2018, 8.5% of people, or 27.5 million, didn\u2019t have health insurance at any point during the year, compared with 7.9% of people, or 25.6 million, the previous year. That reversal comes years after the 2010 Affordable Care Act expanded insurance coverage to millions of Americans.\n\nThe figures released Tuesday offer fresh insight into how the economy fared as it approached its 10th year of expansion. In recent weeks, the government has revised downward its estimates for job gains, economic output and corporate profits at various points in time since early last year. Previous government surveys had suggested income growth picked up last year, though the census figures are considered more reliable because of the quality and scope of the data.\n\nCensus officials said that median household income was essentially the same as it was during previous peaks in 1999 and 2007.\n\nIncome growth over the past decade hasn\u2019t been as strong as some economists would have expected given the tightness of the U.S. labor market. The unemployment rate hovered at or below 4% last year.\n\nPart of the reason is employers have become more adept at holding down wages by using technology, and consolidation in industries such as telecommunications and banking also has damped income growth, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust. The share of workers who are in unions, which push for worker pay raises, also continues to decline steadily.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better off by almost all measures than we were 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Tannenbaum said. \u201cBut there are still some\u2026amber flags that show that economic security remains more elusive for some families.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Did your family\u2019s income change markedly in 2018?

She also moved to a styling location with cheaper rent to lift her bottom line. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to hit that next threshold of $50,000 a year,\u201d she said. Last year her income was several thousand dollars below that.\n\nThe Trump administration pointed to the poverty decline as evidence that its economic agenda is helping the neediest Americans. \u201cEmployment is the best way out of poverty, and President Trump\u2019s policies have made the labor market hotter now than during any time in our history,\u201d said Tomas Philipson, acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said the figures showed \u201cour rigged system allows billionaires to get richer, while working families struggle to survive.\u201d\n\nThe new figures showed that the number of full-time, year-round workers increased by 2.3 million. When looked at by race and ethnicity, median household incomes in America were essentially flat in 2018 for all groups except Asians, who saw theirs rise 4.6% from the previous year in real dollars.\n\nThe report showed little change in the overall distribution of income, but it showed a gain for the second-lowest fifth of all households. The bottom fifth of households\u2014with incomes up to $25,600\u2014accounted for 3.1% of all household income last year. The top fifth of households, which had incomes topping $130,000, collected 52%. The top 5%, with incomes above $248,700, collected 23.1%.\n\nWrite to Janet Adamy at janet.adamy@wsj.com", "description": "The median U.S. household income remained essentially flat at $63,179 in 2018 after three straight years of growth, according to Census Bureau figures that offer a broad look at Americans\u2019 financial well-being.", "authors": ["Janet Adamy", "Paul Overberg", "Janet.Adamy Wsj.Com", "Paul.Overberg Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105603/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
