The Speaker, who for weeks had argued the House had no constitutional requirement to vote on authorizing an impeachment inquiry, relented after coming under fire for keeping the process in the shadows.\n\nThe decision, though, has engendered criticism from the 31 freshman and moderate Democrats representing districts that Trump won in 2016. Some, like freshman Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-NJ), have signaled they will not vote for the resolution on the grounds that impeachment would \u201cnot be good for Democrats or Republicans.\u201d\n\nVan Drew, who represents a district in southern New Jersey that, prior to 2016, had not voted Republican at the presidential level since before the 1980s, even suggested the vote could backfire on the House majority.\n\nVan Drew told Politico on Wednesday, before adding the GOP was clamoring for such a vote:\n\nI didn\u2019t know that it was really necessary at this point. So if they very much want it, it would mean they want to help us a whole lot and really think it\u2019s a good idea, or they think that it was going to put us in a tight spot.\n\nThe congressman\u2019s office did not respond to questions for this story.\n\nAlthough Van Drew was the first to announce his opposition, at least two more vulnerable Democrats\u2014 Reps. Colin Peterson (D-MN) and Anthony Brindisi (D-NY)\u2014have expressed unease with the strategy House leadership is utilizing ahead of the vote.\n\nPeteron\u2019s office confirmed to Breitbart News that the congressman has not indicated how he will be voting on Thursday. The Minnesota Democrat, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, has suggested in recent weeks that he opposes \u201ca partisan impeachment\u201d process.\n\nA spokeswoman for Peterson told Breitbart News, \u201cAs of now, Rep. Peterson has not indicated how he will vote on Thursday.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to a statement he made in September that expressed doubt over impeachment: \u201cWithout significant bipartisan support, impeachment proceedings will be a lengthy and divisive action with no resolution.\u201d\n\nBrindisi, on the other hand, did not respond to requests for comment from Breitbart News. The congressman did, however, openly discuss his doubts about the timing of the resolution and the overall process in which it was crafted with Politico on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt looks like things are moving quicker than a lot of people had anticipated,\u201d the New York Democrat told the outlet. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m in no rush here.\u201d\n\nBrindisi, who ousted former Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) last year in an expensive race that was decided only after a recount, is already a top GOP target in 2020.\n\nApart from Peterson, the 30 other House Democrats representing districts that Trump carried in 2016 did not respond to requests from Breitbart News about how they would be voting on Thursday. Prior to this week, at least twenty had indicated they were fully supportive of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe fact that Pelosi and the Democrat leadership are having serious difficulties keeping their members in line does not bode well for the impeachment inquiry. Compounding problems is that Republicans have become more emboldened and unified against the impeachment inquiry and the forthcoming vote on Thursday.\n\nRepublicans, in particular, have been buoyed by polling showing only 36 percent of the American public believe the House should vote to impeach Trump. There is also increasing skepticism from even GOP moderates about the way Pelosi and the Democrat leadership are breaking House precedent in their push towards impeachment.\n\nMost pointedly, the resolution being voted on Thursday gives extraordinary powers to the House Intelligence Committee chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who has been accused of abusing the powers of his committee to promote the impeachment agenda. The resolution also limits the ability of House Republicans to properly conduct their own impeachment reviews by curtailing minority subpoena power.\n\nSuch heavy-handed tactics by Pelosi and the Democrat leadership have removed any hopes the impeachment inquiry would be bipartisan. While it\u2019s still not final, several GOP sources on Capitol Hill told Breitbart News they expect the minority to unite against the resolution on the floor Thursday. If that happens, the veneer of bipartisan respectability that Pelosi and her leadership team have attempted to stage around the impeachment inquiry would be shredded and the entire proceeding would be seen as a partisan affair.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) made such an argument during an appearance on Fox News Wednesday. The Republican leader claimed that Pelosi had proven the impeachment inquiry \u201cprocess is a sham\u201d by flip-flopping on whether to hold a vote on the procedures governing the probe.\n\nMcCarthy detailed during the interview how the move towards impeachment has divided and even radicalized some freshman Democrats from swing districts. When making his case, the House Republican leader cited Rep. Max Rose (D-NY)\u2014a first-term Democrat who represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, New York \u2014 in October said that Trump should be given the chance to \u201cprove his innocence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want to be here. This is the last thing I want to be doing,\u201d Rose said at the time. \u201cBut no one is to blame but the president. The president says he is innocent, so all we are saying is \u2018prove it.\u2019 But that is not what they are doing. They are not cooperating, and we need to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nRose was one of the 30 House Democrats that declined to elaborate on their support for the impeachment procedure resolution when reached out to by Breitbart News.\n\nMcCarthy said Wednesday that Rose\u2019s comments serve as a symbolic sign of how freshman Democrats face an ever-increasing pressure to back impeachment, despite the potential damage it might have for their House majority.\n\n\u201cIt only takes 19 seats to win the majority, they have 31 Democrats sitting in seats that President Trump carried, and we\u2019re going to carry those again,\u201d the minority leader said.\n\nTo be sure, though, not every single freshman Democrat is taking the safe route, like Rose. Rep. Andy Kim (D-NJ), who initially resisted calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment during special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, reversed course in October, announcing he now supported the idea.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t overlook what has actually happened in terms of the president\u2019s abuse of power,\u201d Kim told constituents at a recent town hall in his New Jersey district.\n\nStill, however, the fact that there are such divergent opinions on the impeachment inquiry within the House majority is cause for concern among leadership. That\u2019s partially why, earlier in the week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer \u2014 Pelosi\u2019s number two \u2014 has begun downplaying the seriousness and gravity of the vote.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to consider whether or not it\u2019s ready to go on Thursday. I hope that\u2019s the case,\u201d the majority leader told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the planned vote.", "description": "Nancy Pelosi\u2019s proposal to vote on formalizing the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has splintered members of her own caucus.", "authors": ["Haris Alic", "Sean Moran", "Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Scary-Pelosi-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
