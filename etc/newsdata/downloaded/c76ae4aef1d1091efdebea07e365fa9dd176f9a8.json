(Trevor Brine/CBC)\n\nJeff Thompson, the principal of the group that purchased the home, told CBC News Wednesday he and others in the group had planned to build multi-family dwellings, and each intended take a suite of their own for themselves and their families.\n\n\"[City planners] loved what we were doing \u2026 they wanted an elegant modern building that fit in with the neighbourhood,\" he said Wednesday.\n\nKagan argued in the meeting Thursday orders to stop the tear-down were motivated by political pressure from area residents. He said the property sat on the market for a year before his clients bought it, adding the group has spent over $2 million to develop the land, including the purchase price.\n\nSt. Vital Coun. Brian Mayes, who sits on the committee, called the issue the \"first of its kind.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, the four [committee members] had to make a choice, and my choice was, I wasn't prepared to see the building come down,\" Mayes said after the meeting. \"I didn't think the city had acted in bad faith.\"\n\nKagan said he's concerned the city's decision will have a chilling effect on developers.\n\n\"Capital is going to flee the city of Winnipeg as fast as it can,\" he said. \"Everybody understands that your investment may not work out. But you can't all of a sudden be stymied halfway through the process because somebody at city council decided they want to make a change.\"\n\nSubmissions for, against demolition\n\nThe meeting heard submissions in favour and opposed to the demolition and the designation of the area as a heritage district.\n\n\"The tyranny of minority, especially the affluent minority, can disrupt developers like us,\" said Tim Comack, who is developing infill housing five blocks away on Grosvenor Avenue.\n\nStudents from St. Mary's Academy and a group of adults showed up with signs outside the home in June, protesting the planned demolition. (Tyson Koschik/CBC)\n\nSkene presented a letter from Ashleigh Everett, daughter of Sen. Douglas Everett, who lived in home since 1961 and raised his family in it.\n\nThe letter disputed Thompson's statements that the house was in disrepair and said her father wouldn't have sold if he'd known the home would be demolished \u2014 although Kagan insisted the previous owners were informed of the plans at the time of purchase.\n\nAfter the meeting, Skene said she sympathizes with the difficulties encountered by all parties in the process, and wants to see improvements in similar dealings in the future.\n\n\"I think there's huge frustration on city council and in planning and for developers. \u2026 I don't minimize that that some of the things that they've had to deal with have been frustrating,\" she said.\n\n\"But you don't then turn around and give them carte blanche to do what they want.\"", "description": "The lawyer for the owners of a sprawling 110-year-old mansion in one of Winnipeg's most exclusive neighbourhoods says they'll sue the city, after a city committee halted plans to demolish the property to make way for a new development.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280267.1568286318!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/514-wellington.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
