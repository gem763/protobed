I will open up fully and share my story once I come to terms with it all and I hope you understand.\n\n'Domestic violence affects millions, both women and men, of every race, religion, culture and status. It\u2019s not just punches and black eyes; it\u2019s yelling, humiliation, stalking, manipulation, coercion, threats and isolation.\n\n'It\u2019s stealing a paycheck, keeping tabs online, non-stop texting, constant use of the silent treatment, or calling someone stupid so often they believe it.\n\nTraits of a narcissist: Grandiosity, Lack of empathy, Emotionless, Self perception of being unique, Needing continual admiration, Sense of entitlement, Exploitative of others, Envious of others, Pompous and arrogant demeanour.\n\n'Will open up fully once I come to terms with it': The former Love Island star admitted that her experience with domestic violence was 'still a bit raw for her'\n\n'Very good at acting. Now I will write about FEELINGS when involved in a narcassistic relationship - Feeling not good enough / lack of worth, Self-doubt and second guessing, Chronically apologetic - Confusion and as though you are losing your mind.\n\n'Helplessness and hopelessness - Sadness and depression - Feelings of anxiousness, shame, worry, - Unsettled, Mental and emotional exhaustion.'\n\nMalin went on to add further guidance for those affected, adding: 'Women\u2019s aid hotline - 0808 2000 247\n\n'I also recommend the FREEDOM COURSE which has helped me massively. \u2018ONCE YOU CHOOSE HOPE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.\u2019\n\nMalin has had a difficult year, beginning with the sad passing of her newborn daughter Consy in January, aged just four weeks, following a premature birth.\n\nHeartbreak: Malin has had a difficult year, beginning with the sad passing of her newborn daughter Consy in January, aged just four weeks, following a premature birth\n\nConsy, who she shares with now ex Tom Kemp, was born on December 23 by emergency Caesarean nearly two months early after a heart defect was detected at 33 weeks.\n\nShe was sadly too small, weighing in at 4lb 8oz to be operated on.\n\nMalin is battling her way through her grief in an incredibly positive fashion, but it's fair to say she has had a tough time in recent years.\n\nShe lost her mother, also called Consy, back in 2017 following a battle with cancer and she has also lost her father to cancer when she was just a year old.\n\nTough: Malin lost her mother, also called Consy back in 2017 following a battle with cancer and she has also lost her father to cancer when she was just a year old\n\nMalin told The Sun just ten weeks after losing her daughter that she is trying her best to be positive.\n\nShe said: 'It would be easy to feel angry. I step outside and see lots of babies and I could look at them and think: \"Why isn\u2019t my girl here?\"\n\n'Or I could think: \"What a beautiful baby.\" It\u2019s the only way I can survive, otherwise depression will swallow me up. I\u2019ll end up suicidal.\n\n'I\u2019ve just got this resilience. It\u2019s been built into me that no one is around for long, and I guess with baby Consy I prepared for the worst.'\n\nFor confidential support call the Women\u2019s Aid Domestic Violence Helpline on 0808 2000 247.
