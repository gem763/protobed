Turkey sent troops across the border to push back American-backed Kurdish fighters on the same day, and the operation was its response to Trump\u2019s letter, according to Gulnur Aybet, an aide to Erdogan.\n\nErdogan\u2019s remarks on Friday are his first public reaction to the widely ridiculed letter. They come a day after he reached a deal with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Ankara to halt Turkey\u2019s offensive for 120 hours to allow the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers a terrorist threat.\n\nErdogan said he was withholding a response at the moment.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see this issue as our priority today,\u201d he told press in Istanbul.
