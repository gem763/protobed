Paul Getty Museum drove residents as well as celebrities like LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger from their homes.\n\nThe fire was reduced to smoldering hot spots by Tuesday but about 9,000 people remained under evacuation orders and firefighters warned that hot, dry winds were due to return Tuesday night, possibly at increasing strength, bringing with them the chance of reigniting the blaze.\n\nMeanwhile, Southern California Edison announced in its quarterly earnings report that its equipment probably caused the November 2018 Woolsey Fire that raged from north of Los Angeles through Malibu to the sea, killing three people and burning more than 1,600 homes and other buildings.\n\nWhile lawsuits from victims\u2019 families had blamed the utility, the cause remains under investigation by Southern California Edison, Cal Fire and the Ventura County Fire Department.\n\nIn its earnings filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SCE said that a draft report from the Ventura County Fire Department indicated that fire investigators determined the utility\u2019s equipment to be the cause.\n\n\u201cAbsent additional evidence, SCE believes that it is likely that its equipment was associated with the ignition of the Woolsey Fire,\u201d the utility said.\n\nLast year, the company told the state Public Utilities Commission an outage of its equipment before the Woolsey Fire may have been caused by a guy wire and a jumper making contact. Guy wires are used to provide pole support and jumpers connect two energized lines.\n\nElectrical equipment has been blamed for causing some of California\u2019s deadliest and most devastating wildfires in recent years, including one last year that killed 85 people and all but destroyed the town of Paradise.\n\nThe threat of billions of dollars in potential wildfire liability costs drove Pacific Gas & Electric - the state\u2019s largest utility - to seek bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe threat of high winds smashing debris into power lines or knocking them down has prompted PG&E; and other utilities to deliberately black out sweeping areas of the state in recent weeks.\n\nMillions of people have been without power for days, many of them in northern and central areas of the state, including the Sonoma County wine country where a wind-whipped blaze still rages and has destroyed dozens of homes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two Southern California utilities acknowledged Tuesday that it is likely their equipment sparked wildfires that killed three people and destroyed hundreds of homes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Robert Jablon"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
