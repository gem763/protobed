A geographer by training, he tagged library visits onto work trips to pore over annual company and shareholder reports. (\u201cNobody had seen them for decades,\u201d he recalled.) He painstakingly traced mergers and acquisitions as companies morphed and amalgamated. He enlisted volunteers across the globe.\n\nLike most analysts, Heede started his work on climate change focused on what individual consumers could do to reduce their emissions. After all, it was the consumer who was \u201cconsuming\u201d the product and actually releasing the emissions from the oil, gas or coal. But over time, he recognized there was a flaw in that approach: Individual consumers can make choices only among what\u2019s already on the market \u2014 but who decided what was on the market? Other, larger forces had shaped an economy dependent on fossil fuels, he realized \u2014 companies who developed the markets for fossil fuels and influenced decisions to build the infrastructure that supported them.\n\nHe asked himself: Shouldn\u2019t the companies who profited from those decisions play a role in mitigating them? With world governments making little progress toward reducing emissions, perhaps pressuring the companies whose products were causing the harm might have more effect?\n\n\u201cWith federal policy being unsupportive and still emphasizing continued energy development, I just thought it would be a new lever to look at the companies that have their hand on the tiller,\u201d said Heede, who now lives in Colorado. \u201cAnd pressure can be exerted in a number of ways.\u201d\n\nBy 2013, roughly a decade after Heede began his search, he had his answer: Just 90 companies had contributed nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s industrial emissions. He could even pinpoint the share of those emissions for which companies existing today are responsible.\n\nIn effect, Heede had established a pillar of a new field of research, now known as attribution science. But it wasn\u2019t just an academic exercise: It\u2019s a weapon that climate campaigners are starting to wield to put fossil fuel companies on the hook for billions of dollars in damages. It\u2019s a kind of end run around a political system they see as forced into gridlock by fossil fuel industry influence.\n\nHeede and his collaborators are part of a paradigm shift in how to assign blame for climate change. For decades, as signs have grown that the planet is warming, the public and defenders of industry have laid the blame on end users, the ordinary people who drove their cars too much or blasted air conditioning in their homes. Those add up. But attribution science has the effect of moving the blame back one step, away from consumers and onto the companies that extracted the oil, coal and gas that have powered our planet for decades.\n\nA gas flare from a petroleum refinery in Norco, Louisiana.

The suit alleges that Exxon used a different internal estimate for the cost that carbon-reduction policies would have on its business than it told investors; oral arguments for that case begin this week.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that the legal interest would pick up so fast,\u201d Heede said in an interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how this data was going to be used. But I knew that for any legal action \u2014 or, for that matter, shareholder pressure or regulatory pressure \u2014 we had to know who the companies were and what they contributed.\u201d\n\nATTRIBUTION SCIENCE originated with the very legal question it might now be used to address.\n\nIn 2003, the science journal Nature published an article by Oxford University scientist Myles Allen titled \u201cLiability for climate change.\u201d Allen wondered aloud how to solve \u201cthe attribution problem\u201d to demonstrate precisely how much burning fossil fuels were responsible for worsening climate-linked developments. If one could do that, he surmised, it would be possible to sue fossil fuel companies for damages.\n\nA year later, Allen and colleagues D\u00e1ith\u00ed Stone, Peter Stott and Mark Hawkins published the first \u201cextreme event attribution\u201d study. Using computer models, they compared human-caused, post-Industrial Revolution emissions with scenarios lacking such emissions, known as natural variability. They concluded that man-made greenhouse gas emissions had more than doubled the likelihood of the deadly European heatwave of 2003, which killed 27,000 people. The analysis was straightforward and remains the bedrock of extreme event attribution science.\n\nIn the years that followed, more severe weather patterns followed, including Superstorm Sandy on America\u2019s Eastern Seaboard in 2012. Weather forecasters cited in media reports tended to be uncomfortable linking these events to climate change, often saying it was hard to connect individual weather events to an overall pattern of global warming.\n\nBut the emerging attribution scientists didn\u2019t agree. In 2015, Fredi Otto, acting director at the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, and Heidi Cullen, a climate scientist who is now at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, formed the World Weather Attribution group with the goal of providing \u201crapid response\u201d analysis of climate-fueled disasters. They wanted to show just how much human emissions had worsened those events or made them likelier to occur.\n\nHomes on the New Jersey shore damaged by Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

You can\u2019t do science so fast, and the models are not good enough,\u2019\u201d said Otto, who did her postdoctorate work under Allen.\n\nSkeptics have since mostly dissipated, though some remain. The Bulletin of the American Metereological Society began publishing annual event attribution analyses in 2011. Reruns of the World Weather Attribution analyses confirmed the group\u2019s initial efforts. It helped that the National Academy of Sciences wrote a 2016 report on climate attribution science and identified World Weather Attribution\u2019s methods as the gold standard. Last year, the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service asked World Weather Attribution to write a road map to operationalize the science so it can better predict and respond to disasters; a prototype could launch this fall.\n\nOn top of that, computer modeling vastly improved, and quickly, permitting the volume and sophistication required for World Weather Attribution group\u2019s mission. Michael Wehner, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said he today could complete his study of the devastating 2013 Colorado floods in a matter of days, whereas the original study took his team three years. He has since expanded his work to hurricanes, finding that human-driven climate change boosted Hurricane Harvey\u2019s August 2017 rainfall by as much as 38 percent.\n\n\u201cRead the papers. If you don\u2019t believe the papers, then do your own,\u201d Wehner said of attribution science critics. \u201cThis body of literature, which is now fairly large, clearly tells us that dangerous climate change is upon us, and people are suffering and dying \u2014 and it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d\n\nSome scientists aren\u2019t yet ready to fully embrace extreme event attribution science. The reinsurance industry, which covers megalosses in the event primary insurers can\u2019t foot the bill, contends other factors like building codes and zoning decisions contribute a great deal to the overall financial toll from major disasters.\n\n\u201cWe follow the science very closely. We try to understand what this actually means to the risk which we are taking. But when it really comes down to attribution of certain events to climate change, our view is that this piece of science is at an early stage,\u201d said Ernst Rauch, chief climate scientist and global head of climate and public sector business development with Munich Re, a reinsurance company.\n\nEven the National Academy of Sciences in its 2016 report sounded a cautionary note. Finding the precise climate fingerprint for events with nonmeteorological factors, such as drought and wildfire, can be challenging. Events backed up by robust observational records with well-understood physical effects, like long-term temperature increases, are most scientifically sound.\n\n\u201cThe ability to attribute the causes of some extreme event types has advanced rapidly since the emergence of event attribution science a little more than a decade ago, while attribution of other event types remains challenging,\u201d the report said.\n\nFor any potential uncertainty about climate attribution, Heede said there\u2019s at least one definite truth about fossil fuel companies that should override the rest.\n\n\u201cThey were aware decades ago what trouble climate change would be,\u201d he said.\n\nA stranded traveler resting in London\u2019s St. Pancras rail station this summer.

Another lawsuit by Pacific Coast fishermen against Chevron also seeks climate damages.\n\nThe cases face long odds. The legal arguments and the science are largely untested in the context of suing individual companies for the complicated effects of and myriad sources driving global climate change.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to see how there can be a specific nexus between the conduct of these defendants and any of the adaptations and other costs that these municipalities are incurring,\u201d said Brendan Collins, an environmental attorney at Ballard Spahr LLP who is not involved in the cases.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time plaintiffs have sought climate change damages from energy companies.\n\nFossil fuel companies have successfully swatted away past cases, all of which have been federal, in part because the courts say Congress has responsibility for regulating greenhouse gas emissions, but Congress hasn\u2019t yet amended the 1990 Clean Air Act to incorporate concerns about climate change. So, climate cases get stuck.\n\nThe novel legal innovation this time is that plaintiffs are aiming to sue in state courts. States have common law provisions that allow for claims under two legal theories: public nuisance, that a party is interfering with the rights of citizens, or product liability, that the dangers of using a product must be communicated to the public. Plaintiffs are trying to make the case that energy companies that extract, transport or market fuels are a public nuisance because they are destroying their residents\u2019 enjoyment of a stable climate and forcing costs on them. Under product liability, plaintiffs are arguing that the companies pushed those products into the market knowing these probable, damaging outcomes.\n\nAn overwhelmed surge barrier near New Orleans.

But the courts have so far rebuffed fossil fuel companies\u2019 attempts to punt the cases to federal jurisdiction.\n\nThe lawsuits aren\u2019t all the same. Some cities are suing over past and future costs to defend against sea level rise; fishermen want compensation for harming a West Coast crab fishery; suits filed on behalf of children contend fossil fuel companies deprived future generations\u2019 quality of life by driving climate change. Most of the lawsuits argue that fossil fuel companies marketed a product they knew to be harmful without acknowledging \u2014 and, in fact, sowing doubt and confusion about \u2014 those harms.\n\nPlaintiffs see a parallel to the tobacco industry. That industry fell victim to product liability lawsuits because companies knew their product caused harm but misled the public. More contemporary examples of successful lawsuits include a case against Monsanto for cancer linked to its weed-killer, Roundup, and action against pharmaceutical companies for distributing opioids despite known risks and abuse.\n\nFossil fuel companies have argued that they had no control over how their product was used after selling it \u2014 it\u2019s people who put gasoline in their cars, not Exxon Mobil. They are also expected to argue that all levels of government have cemented fossil fuels\u2019 place in American society through tax incentives, infrastructure spending and other policies. That is the crux of what the companies argued in a federal case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California brought in 2017 by the cities of Oakland and San Francisco.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs do not assert that the mere extraction or sale of fossil fuels created the alleged nuisance (nor could they), but rather that the combustion of fossil fuels by third-party users \u2014 such as Plaintiffs themselves \u2014 causes global warming and rising seas,\u201d attorneys for BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Shell wrote in a March 2018 motion to dismiss.\n\nThe federal case ultimately was dismissed, but Oakland and San Francisco are appealing.\n\n\u201cThey will try to claim the harm from their product is not at all their responsibility,\u201d said Peter Frumhoff, science director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, who helped develop the framework for using climate attribution science in the courts. \u201cIt\u2019s always somebody else, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute spokesperson Reid Porter said the oil and gas trade association would not comment on pending litigation.\n\n\u201cThe natural gas and oil industry is actively addressing the complex global challenge of climate change, investing in cutting edge technologies, efficiency improvements, and cleaner fuels,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nClimate protesters in Bonn, Germany.

The idea of prosecuting companies has gained currency among Democratic presidential candidates. Much like the fight against pharmaceutical companies that knowingly pushed opioids on American consumers, the push against fossil fuel companies resonates with anti-corporate zeal sweeping voters in both parties.\n\nThe political atmosphere is also far more partisan than the major environmental courtroom victories of decades ago, and climate change is firmly ensconced in the U.S. culture wars, noted Durwood Zaelke, founder and president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development. Zaelke\u2019s organization started the Center for Climate Integrity, which is aiding the civil climate lawsuits.\n\nBut shifts are occurring beneath the surface, Zaelke said. Investors are prodding companies into action on climate, with companies like BP agreeing to develop a strategy to survive as a business under policies designed to keep global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius. Republicans are no longer debating whether humans are baking the planet, even going as far as to offer policy solutions. Young activists have put climate change front and center on the global agenda.\n\nEvents and public opinion are trending in the right direction, Zaelke said. But it will still take an enormous leap for a breakthrough. He thinks climate attribution and the courts could provide the needed boost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a pretty optimistic mood right now believing these strands can come together,\u201d Zaelke said. \u201cWe all have a chance to be a little more heroic when circumstances demand, and that\u2019s where we are \u2014 circumstances demand more heroism from the lawyers, the youth, the judges.\u201d\n\nZack Colman covers energy policy for POLITICO Pro.\n\n\n\nAuthors:\n\nclarification: An earlier version of this article misidentified the publication that began publishing annual event attribution analyses.
