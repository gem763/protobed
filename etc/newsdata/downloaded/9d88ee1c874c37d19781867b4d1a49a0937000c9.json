I know i\u2019m getting older because i seem to be shrinking and getting smaller and smaller day by day. And then the realisation dawns on me that it\u2019s not that i\u2019m getting smaller and smaller but all the young people i come across are getting larger and larger.\n\nOf almost all the people that Bunny and i know, our friends and our family members, the children are bigger than their parents, the sons taller than their dads, and the daughters taller than their moms, and sometimes even taller than their dads as well.\n\nAs those who belong to the mom-and-dad age group can\u2019t all be shrinking and becoming smaller, it must be that today\u2019s kids are growing up to be taller and bigger. Bunny attributes this to genetically modified or nutritionally enriched foodstuff. Almost everything we eat today, from veggies and fruits, to dairy products and processed food, contains various chemicals and other additives, which over time can effect hormonal and other bodily changes.\n\nThis was not the case with earlier generations. All the food we ate was natural \u2013 we\u2019d call it \u2018organic\u2019 now \u2013 and the result was that children grew up to be more or less the same size as their parents.\n\nBut today\u2019s Generation X should more properly be called Generation XL, as in Extra Large, as practically everyone belonging to it could pass off, height-wise, as a pro All-American basketball player. And what\u2019s got me wondering is when will this generational size increase stop. Will Generation Y, be even bigger than Generation XL, and Generation Z be larger than Generation Y? Will humans keep growing till they become a race of giants, like the Brobdingnagians of Gulliver\u2019s Travels?\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure. With children increasingly growing bigger than their parents, grown-ups shouldn\u2019t be called grown-ups anymore. They should be called grown-downs.", "description": "They say that as you grow older you tend to shrink and get smaller.\u00a0 I know i\u2019m getting older because i seem to be shrinking and getting smaller and smaller day by day.
