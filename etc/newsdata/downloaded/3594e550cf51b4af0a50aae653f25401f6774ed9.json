I reached around to grab her bag but I couldn\u2019t grab it in time and she fell,\u201d Adam said.\n\n\u201cI looked, but I couldn\u2019t see her because my eyes are not that good.\u201d\n\nAdam called emergency services and the 29-year-old\u2019s body was found a half an hour later, Daily Mail reports.\n\nAccording to Metro UK, she had suffered catastrophic brain injuries and an investigation found that there were no suspicious circumstances.\n\nAfter the tragedy, Adam posted a sweet tribute to Hannah on Instagram.\n\n\u201cToday I lost my soul mate, my partner in crime, my absolute rock,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWords can\u2019t begin to explain the pain I\u2019m feeling right now but I\u2019m honoured to have shared what time we had. I will spend the rest of my life making you proud and making myself a better person.\n\n\u201cYou lifted me up and made me what I am in dark times and in happy times. I will love you forever. Sleep tight my darling until I see you again.\u201d\n\nSources: Sun UK, Daily Mail, Metro UK", "description": "As they got up to leave the scenic spot, Hannah slipped and fell.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9538/280878ada77f426391f91e6ad3a1354e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
