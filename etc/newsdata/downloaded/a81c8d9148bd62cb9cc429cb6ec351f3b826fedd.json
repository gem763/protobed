and Gabe Batstone\u2019s failed relationship: their daughter, Teagan.\n\nA little girl with a gentle smile, she embraced everything that came her way.\n\nShe loved gymnastics, tennis, running and especially animals.\n\nLisa and Gabe split in 2008, when Teagan was just two years old, and divorced two years later.\n\nLisa, 41, had struggled to cope with the break-up and adjusting to her new life as a single mum.\n\nWhen she and Gabe tried to sort out the custody arrangements, tensions always ran high.\n\nLisa was granted custody of Teagan, but Gabe wanted to be involved in his daughter\u2019s life as much as possible.\n\nTo help improve their communication with each other, they enlisted the help of a family counsellor and started to make official plans about childcare via email.\n\nLisa remained in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, while Gabe moved to Ottawa, where he went on to marry his new partner, Stephanie.\n\n(Image: Surrey nowleader)\n\nShe already had a five-year-old son, but loved Teagan like her own, and Teagan adored her step-brother.\n\nShe\u2019d go to stay with Gabe and Stephanie as often as she could, and Gabe would come to see her whenever he had the chance.\n\nThen in 2012 the couple had a son together.\n\nFor Lisa, however, life was less joyful.\n\nHer struggle with depression and anxiety spilled over, and in 2012 she attempted to take her own life.\n\nTeagan went to stay with her dad, but once Lisa had recovered and was deemed safe to look after her daughter again, she was returned to her.\n\nWorried about Lisa\u2019s state of mind, Gabe tried to get custody of Teagan, but his request was declined.\n\nMeticulous planning\n\nBy 2014, it was clear that Lisa\u2019s behaviour was becoming irrational.\n\nShe\u2019d send Gabe endless texts and emails, and would call constantly through the week.\n\nIt got to the point where there were so many messages, he\u2019d have to respond to them in bulk, once a week.\n\nSome of them claimed there was an emergency, but when he\u2019d call to check if Lisa was OK, they\u2019d argue and one of them would hang up.\n\nNonetheless, they had a child together, so Gabe tried to work through it and put Teagan first.\n\nAlthough Lisa had the power to make it difficult for him, he remained civil.\n\nIn early December 2014, Lisa took Teagan on a day out to a zip-line centre and the eight-year-old was seen beaming in the photos that Lisa shared on social media.\n\nThe same week, Gabe paid his daughter a visit, dropping her off at school before he left for home.\n\nLater, Lisa messaged him with the words, \u2018It seems you\u2019d rather I disappeared.\u2019\n\nHe didn\u2019t know what she meant.\n\nThis was just the latest in a long line of wild accusations.\n\nThat night, 9 December, Lisa told Teagan they were going to have a \u2018camp-out\u2019 in their living room.\n\nIt must have seemed such fun for the little girl, as they set up makeshift beds.\n\nIn the early hours of 10 December, Gabe received a message from Lisa saying Teagan was unwell with the flu and wouldn\u2019t be going to school.\n\nThen at lunchtime that day, a 911 call was placed by a member of the public in Surrey, saying a woman had crashed her car in a residential cul-de-sac.\n\nIt initially seemed to the police to be a regular traffic call-out, but soon after they arrived, they realised it was far more serious.\n\nThe car was Lisa\u2019s.\n\nShe was found curled up in the boot.\n\nIn her arms, she was cradling her daughter\u2019s dead body.\n\nIt was a horrific and confusing scene.\n\nHow could the child have been killed in such a minor accident?\n\n(Image: CTV)\n\nOfficers realised something wasn\u2019t right.\n\nLisa kept repeating, \u2018I just wanna die\u2019, and that she wanted her daughter to \u2018be with Jesus\u2019.\n\nShe was found with a large kitchen knife.\n\nOnce Lisa had been taken in for questioning, investigators were able to piece together what had happened.\n\nTeagan hadn\u2019t died in the crash \u2013 she\u2019d been killed by her own mother.\n\nIn a two-hour-long interview, Lisa was recorded blaming what she\u2019d done on her struggle with mental health.\n\nAnd when it came to a motive, they could find only one: Lisa had killed Teagan to spite her ex-husband, to make sure Gabe didn\u2019t get custody.\n\nPremeditated evil\n\nOn the night of their \u2018camp-out\u2019 Teagan had been sleeping when Lisa fetched a plastic bag and held it over her daughter\u2019s mouth and nose.\n\nIt would have taken four to five minutes to ensure she was dead.\n\nLisa claimed she then intended to take her own life.\n\nShe left notes for people to find.\n\nOne read, \u2018You win, Gabe\u2019.\n\nAnother said, \u2018You broke me\u2019.\n\nShe wrote that she couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d done and deserved to be punished.\n\nBut she told police she failed to take her own life and decided she would drive off a cliff or stab herself instead.\n\nSo she placed Teagan\u2019s body in the boot of her car, grabbed a knife and drove away.\n\nThen she ran her car into a ditch.\n\n(Image: surreynowleader)\n\n\u2018I went and knocked on someone\u2019s door and said, \u201cPlease call the police, my daughter\u2019s dead in the car,\u201d\u2019 Lisa told officers.\n\n\u2018And then I crawled in and snuggled with her until the last minute.\u2019\n\nWhen Gabe found out what his ex-wife had done, he was distraught.\n\nIt was unthinkable that he\u2019d been holding her hand just the day before and was now faced with having to choose the clothes to bury her in.\n\nDespite Lisa\u2019s claims of incapacity, she was deemed mentally fit for trial.\n\nIn 2018, she pleaded not guilty to the second-degree murder of her daughter.\n\nThe prosecution maintained she\u2019d killed Teagan to spite her husband, because she\u2019d planned to take her life and didn\u2019t want him to get custody afterwards.\n\nThey pointed out that in one of the notes she\u2019d left, she\u2019d said, \u2018I couldn\u2019t imagine leaving here and leaving her to him\u2019.\n\nLisa could have called 911 at any point, but she didn\u2019t.\n\nHer defence lawyers claimed she\u2019d killed Teagan because her mental illness made her wrongly believe her daughter was in danger from her father.\n\nBut in March this year, she was found guilty, and this September faced sentencing.\n\n(Image: Edmonton journal)\n\nThe second-degree murder conviction automatically meant she\u2019d get life, but there were arguments about how long her parole period should be.\n\nLisa\u2019s lawyers said she\u2019d been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder while awaiting trial, and that at the time of the murder she\u2019d been suffering from anxiety.\n\nBut Justice Catherine Murray said Lisa had breached Teagan\u2019s trust in the worst possible way and lied about the extent of her mental illness to justify what she\u2019d done.\n\nShe called the decision to murder \u2018deliberate, systematic, focused, purposeful and goal-oriented\u2019.\n\nLisa sobbed as she read a statement to the court apologising for what she\u2019d done.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d give anything to go back and change what happened.\n\n'Each morning, I wake up to this excruciating nightmare and I don\u2019t know how this can be real.\n\n'I miss my sweet girl so much,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018I cannot believe I did what I did \u2013 but I know her death is my fault.\u2019\n\n(Image: CBC/Facebook)\n\nAn unimaginable crime\n\nLisa was given an automatic life sentence.\n\nShe will serve a minimum of 15 years before she can be considered for parole.\n\nShe has appealed.\n\nJustice Murray said the court needed to send a strong message to arguing parents that they can\u2019t use their children as \u2018pawns in matrimonial or personal disputes\u2019.\n\n\u2018To describe Teagan\u2019s death as tragic is an understatement,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018It has clearly left a hole that will never be filled.'\n\nThat she was taken from all who loved her very much is devastating. In my view, loving someone does not render murdering them less serious.'\n\n'Her mother was her safety net, her mother was her protector.\u2019\n\nGabe and Stephanie have set up Teagan\u2019s Voice, which advocates for children\u2019s right to protection from violence.\n\nThey believe there were warning signs that were ignored, leading to Teagan\u2019s fate.\n\nAn innocent child had had her future stolen because of the past. \u25a0", "description": "Eight-year-old Teagan Batstone paid a tragic price when her Canadian parents Lisa and Gabe's separated", "authors": ["Gail Shortland", "Image", "Surrey Nowleader", "Ctv", "Surreynowleader", "Edmonton Journal", "Cbc Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641087.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_News-1130-Lisa-Batstone-and-Teagan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
