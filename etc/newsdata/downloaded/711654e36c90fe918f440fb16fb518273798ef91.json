A Turkish air strike in Ras al Ain killed 14 people including 10 civilians on Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. The SDF said a \u201ccivilian convoy\u201d had been targeted.\n\nTurkey\u2019s offensive aims to neutralise the Kurdish YPG militia, the main component of the SDF and seen by Ankara as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. But the SDF has also been Washington\u2019s key ally in fighting that has dismantled Islamic State\u2019s jihadist \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria.\n\nAnkara\u2019s stated aim is to carve out a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it is hosting. Erdogan has threatened to send them to Europe if the EU does not back his assault.\n\nBut the Turkish offensive has triggered international alarm over its large-scale displacements of civilians and, amidst the upheaval, a heightened risk of Islamic State militants escaping from prisons run by the Kurdish-led authorities.\n\nSome 785 foreigners affiliated with Islamic State fled a camp where they were being held in northern Syria after shelling by Turkish forces on Sunday, the region\u2019s Kurdish-led administration said.\n\nErdogan dismissed the reports and told the state-run Anadolu news agency that accounts of escapes by Islamic State prisoners were \u201cdisinformation\u201d aimed at provoking the West.\n\nSANCTIONS THREAT\n\nTurkey now faces threats of possible sanctions from NATO ally the United States unless it calls off the incursion.\n\nTwo other NATO allies, Germany and France, have suspended arms exports to Turkey, and French President Emmanuel Macron was convening an emergency defence cabinet meeting on Sunday to discuss options regarding the offensive.\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesman said on Sunday that Washington was studying \u201cextremely troubling\u201d reports that a Kurdish politician and captured Kurdish fighters were killed by Turkish proxy forces amid the offensive.\n\nMore than 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said on Sunday.\n\nSunday\u2019s word of the planned evacuation of U.S. forces came a week after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke by telephone with Erdogan and then abruptly shifted policy and withdrew a smaller number of U.S. troops deployed to support Kurdish forces in the campaign against Islamic State.\n\n\u201cIn the last 24 hours, we learned that (the Turks) likely intend to extend their attack further south than originally planned, and to the west,\u201d Esper said in an interview with CBS. \u201cWe also have learned in the last 24 hours that the ... SDF are looking to cut a deal, if you will, with the Syrians and the Russians to counter-attack against the Turks in the north.\u201d\n\nA Syrian Kurdish politician told Reuters that SDF and Syrian government officials have been holding negotiations at a Russian airbase in Syria with Russian participation, and expressed hope for a deal that would halt a Turkish attack.\n\nSyrian state media reported that the Syrian army has begun deploying its troops to northern battlefronts to confront \u201cTurkish aggression\u201d on Syrian territory.\n\nEsper called the situation \u201cuntenable\u201d for U.S. forces, saying he spoke with Trump on Saturday night and that the president directed the U.S. military to \u201cbegin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria\u201d.\n\nTwo U.S. officials told Reuters the bulk of U.S. forces could be pulled out of northern Syria within days.\n\nSmoke billows out after Turkish shelling on the Syrian town of Ras al Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 13, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nIn a meeting with conservative Christian activists late on Saturday, Trump - who has come under withering criticism for the move, including from politicians in his own Republican Party who normally support him - defended his decision to withdraw troops from the Syrian border. He said the United States should prioritise protecting its own frontiers.\n\nThe latest pressure on Trump comes as the White House was already embroiled in an impeachment inquiry led by Democratic opponents in the U.S. House.\n\nTERRITORIAL GAINS\n\nErdogan told reporters that Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies had besieged Tel Abyad, a key border town west of Ras al Ain. They later advanced into the centre of Tel Abyad where the situation was calm and they were conducting search operations, a Reuters witness said.\n\nErdogan said Turkish-led forces had killed 440 SDF fighters so far and captured 109 square km (42 square miles) of terrain, including 17 villages around Tel Abyad and four villages around Ras Al Ain.\n\nIn Akcakale on the Turkish side of the border, around 100 people waved Turkish flags and sounded car horns as they celebrated reports of Turkish-led forces seizing Tel Abyad, a Reuters news team reported.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Anadolu news agency said the rebels seized complete control of Suluk, some 10 km (6 miles) from the border. But an SDF spokesman said its forces repelled the attack and were still in control.\n\nSuluk is southeast of Tel Abyad, one of the two main targets in the incursion, which was bombarded by Turkish howitzers on Sunday afternoon, a witness in Akcakale said.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels, known as the National Army, advanced into Ras al Ain on Saturday but by Sunday there were still conflicting reports as to which side was in control.\n\nLebanese broadcaster al-Mayadeen said on Sunday that the Syrian army would deploy within 48 hours to the town of Kobani, which is held by the SDF, and the nearby town of Manbij, which is controlled by SDF-aligned forces.\n\nMILITANT PRISONERS\n\nThe SDF hold large swathes of northern Syria that were once controlled by Islamic State. The SDF has been keeping thousands of IS jihadists in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nBut this weekend, 785 Islamic State-affiliated foreigners escaped the camp at Ain Issa, the region\u2019s Kurdish-led administration said in a statement.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory, citing sources in the camp, said around 100 people had escaped.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nSDF official Marvan Qamishlo told Reuters there were not enough guards for the camp, which is about 30 km (20 miles) south of the Turkish border, saying there were 60-70 compared with a normal level of no fewer than 700 for the camp of 12,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe guarding is very weak now,\u201d he said, saying there was unrest and escape attempts in prisons across northern Syria. \u201cThey are breaking the doors, screaming and attacking the security forces, especially in the camps,\u201d he added.", "description": "The United States is poised to withdraw some 1,000 troops from northern Syria, its defence secretary said on Sunday, after learning that Turkey planned to extend its military incursion against Kurdish militia further south than originally planned.", "authors": ["Sarah N.
