Also pictured are Archie, Oscar and father Noel\n\nThe family (pictured) have to fork out \u00a3350 a week on food and spend three hours tidying up every night to keep their house in check\n\nMr and Mrs Radford have to pay a minimum of \u00a3150 if they want to take the family out for dinner and going on holiday means bringing at least seven suitcases.\n\nWashing duties are 'non-stop', with 18kg of clothes being washed every day of the week.\n\nThe family have already been to Florida on holiday this year and were planning a trip to the Netherlands.\n\nThe Radford children Chris, 30; Sophie, 25; Chloe, 23; Jack, 22; Daniel, 20; Luke, 18; Millie, 17; Katie, 16; James, 15; Ellie, 14; Aimee, 13; Josh, 12; Max, 11; Tillie, nine; Oscar, seven; Casper, six; Hallie, four; Phoebe, three; Archie, 18 months; Bonnie, 11 months. Sadly Alfie, the couple's 17th child, was still born on July 6th 2014\n\nBut Mrs Radford described the packing process as a 'military operation', with her sectioning the children's clothes into bin bags to organise them all.\n\nThey first shot to fame in 2008, when it emerged the baker and his wife were set to have a 'baker's dozen' of children, 13.\n\nWhen it comes to going to the cinema, things can get very pricey.\n\nWhile many of us may scoff at the ever increasing price of a cinema ticket, spare a thought for the parents of 21 children, who say a single trip can set them back over \u00a3100.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to FEMAIL in July, the busy mother said: 'We do like to go to the cinema, especially in the holidays when the kids are a bit bored, it's raining and there's not much else for them to do. But it can be up to \u00a310 per person so it can work out really expensive!'\n\nResearch provided by Compare the Market found that the average family spends \u00a3542 each summer holiday ensuring the kids are entertained.\n\nAnd for the Radfords, trampolining is one of the most expensive days out - setting them back around \u00a3230.\n\nThe family Mrs Radford with have already been to Florida on holiday this year and were planning a trip to the Netherlands\n\nMr and Mrs Radford first shot to fame in 2008, when it emerged the baker and his wife were set to have a 'baker's dozen' of children, 13\n\n'It's about \u00a310 each by the time you've got the socks and everything so we do try to avoid doing that with them all,' said Mrs Radford.\n\nIn a bid to keep costs low, the mother-of-21, who also has two grandchildren, Daisy, six and Aypril, four, Leo, two, looks anywhere she can to save the pennies.\n\n'Believe it or not, we don't tend to get group discounts because we find family tickets are usually for two adults and two children - and obviously there's a lot of us,' she explained.\n\n'We often look for the different discount codes you can find on the internet and go with whatever offers they've got on.'\n\nOffering advice to other parents, she added: 'A lot of our best days out have been packing up a picnic and just going for a walk with the kids, or going to a park, or to the beach - and they're all free days out.'", "description": "Sue Radford (pictured), 44, and her husband Noel, 48, from Morecambe, Lancashire, posted a YouTube clip on Sunday showing her latest ultrasound.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/01/19972256-0-image-a-104_1571618135956.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
