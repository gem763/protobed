Storm chaser Josh Morgerman rode out Hurricane Dorian at ground zero \u2014 Marsh Harbour, Abaco.\n\nThe storm has left behind a humanitarian crisis in the northwest Bahamas, where at least 50 people are dead, more than 1,000 people are missing and thousands are without food, water and shelter.\n\n[When Hurricane Dorian blew through the Bahamas, it exposed one of the world\u2019s great faultlines of inequality]\n\nIn his video and firsthand account, Morgerman chronicles Dorian\u2019s punishing wrath that he hopes will draw more attention to just how severe and horrifying the storm was, as well as its devastating toll.\n\nMorgerman, who has intercepted more hurricane cores than any living person, is the star of the reality TV show \u201cHurricane Man,\u201d which debuts this Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern on the Science Channel.\n\nRecounting his experience in Dorian, Morgerman said, \u201cI had that feeling when I landed [in Abaco] that this was going to be a chase for the ages.\u201d But as Dorian\u2019s fury arrived in Abaco on Sept. 1 Morgerman, vanished into Internet silence. Some feared the worst.\n\nYep, I\u2019m alive. Made it to Nassau. #Hurricane #DORIAN: By far the most intense cyclone I\u2019ve witnessed in 28 years of chasing. Thought I was playing it safe by riding it out in a solid-concrete school on a hill in Marsh Harbour. Thought wrong. \u2014 Josh Morgerman (@iCyclone) September 3, 2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t for another 55 hours \u2014 around the time Dorian was finally beginning to pull away from Grand Bahama \u2014 that Morgerman tweeted again. \u201cYep, I\u2019m alive,\u201d he wrote. And he has a hell of a story to tell.\n\nHis tale of pursuing Dorian begins in New York. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to chase anything,\u201d said Morgerman. \u201cThen for a couple days I started thinking about going to Puerto Rico when Dorian looked to pull some [rapid intensification]. I almost went, but didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDorian skirted east of Puerto Rico on Aug. 28, lashing the Virgin Islands with 90 mph wind gusts as it achieved hurricane status. Over the next three days it would undergo intermittent bouts of rapid intensification, peaking as a high-end Category 5 monstrosity on Sept. 1. Morgerman was ready.\n\n\u201cI flew to Florida, but Dorian ended up being a big fake-out,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew if I wanted a piece of this storm, I had to go to Great Abaco.\u201d And he did. His flight \u2014 the last one to an island holding its breath \u2014 was nearly full, travelers eager to make it home before disaster struck.\n\n\u201cI landed, and I had that \u2018Yeah, this is big\u2019 feeling.\u201d\n\nBut few others seemed aware of the horror that soon would unfold. \u201cI\u2019m around all these people, normal people, not weather nerds,\u201d Morgerman said. \u201cThey have no clue.\u201d\n\nHis chases have taken him all over, both around the world and close to home. Many locations \u2014 like the Philippines or the Bahamas \u2014 are prone to hurricanes. Many Bahamians have ridden out a dozen or more storms. That\u2019s both a blessing and a curse.\n\n\u201cPeople who are used to hurricanes \u2026 get a false sense of security,\u201d said Morgerman. \u201cThey never realized that Dorian would be an absolute monster.\u201d\n\nMorgerman described Dorian as approaching the island \u201clike a bowling ball,\u201d with the intrepid cinematographer and data-gatherer and 11 others riding out the storm\u2019s first half in a \u201csolid concrete school on a hill\u201d to escape the surge.\n\n\u201cWe got a perfect direct hit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe video captures the extreme fury that is a Category 5 eyewall. \u201cThe duration of the core of really destructive winds was about five hours,\u201d Morgerman said. That\u2019s an inordinate amount of time to be subjected to high-end tornado-force winds.\n\nLess than a year ago, Morgerman intercepted another Category 5, Hurricane Michael, which ravaged the Florida Panhandle. \u201cMichael was much quicker\u201d compared with Dorian, he said.\n\nMorgerman spent 90 minutes in Dorian\u2019s front eyewall, the zone of most extreme winds, and nearly two hours in its calm eye. He described the moment he emerged from his bunkerlike shelter. \u201cYou go outside and your eyes take a minute to adjust. After all, you\u2019ve just been in this pitch-black bunker.\u201d On recording the eyewall he said, \u201cYou might as well be filming a white curtain.\u201d\n\nCloaked in the eyewall were a barrage of miniswirls and tornado-like vortices with \u201cwild pressure fluctuations\u201d evident. \u201cThere was some really weird stuff,\u201d said Morgerman. \u201cAnd I know there were some [miniswirls and tornadoes] because I saw a car tossed the wrong way.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe aftermath on Great Abaco Island after Hurricane Dorian. (Josh Morgerman)\n\nHe described cars as being \u201cmangled and mutilated,\u201d thrown about haphazardly. \u201cSome of them had parts of the engines ripped out. There was a lot of weird stuff like that.\u201d\n\nOnce the eye arrived, Morgerman and other storm victims he sheltered with immediately sought refuge elsewhere. \u201cI was very scared,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t ride out the second half in this little bunker.\u201d\n\nNext they proceeded to a government center down the road, with Morgerman unable to access any data to know when the eyewall would abruptly return. \u201cThe idea of getting caught out on the road really spooked me,\u201d he said.\n\nFrantically piled into few functioning cars (one of them mine) & relocated to government complex before backside struck. Building filled with terrorized refugees, many who had swam to safety or abandoned collapsed houses. The calm eye saved lives\u2014gave victims chance to relocate. \u2014 Josh Morgerman (@iCyclone) September 3, 2019\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhen we got to the complex, that\u2019s when you really got the full sense of the scale. Everyone you talked to had an epic tale of a near-death experience. \u2026 Everyone just had this story you couldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nMorgerman recounted that storm victims swam to refuge, losing everything but the clothes on their back. \u201cI [talked with people who had] loved ones swept away, or saw bodies. I think [the death toll] will be higher,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Morgerman, hurricanes are scientific; the thrill of the chase is purely meteorological. But his efforts are twofold: He aims to show people the scope of the devastation, and hopefully spur action.\n\n\u201cThe human suffering \u2026 I want to make sure it stays in the news, because we\u2019ve got to help them\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNothing sparks assistance and aid like seeing it,\u201d he said. \u201cUnlike most of my videos, this one really shows the aftermath.\u201d\n\nMorgerman hopes that what he captured will trigger action and solicit the aid that\u2019s so desperately needed on the ravaged islands.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me the most was this neighborhood called the Mudd,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a poor, low-lying part of Marsh Harbour that was just scoured \u2026 football fields of wreckage from the combination of those winds and the storm surge. [They\u2019re still finding] bodies there before they figure out what happened and how many people died. The very last shot that my video closes with is of that neighborhood. It conveys the scale of the impact.\"", "description": "Josh Morgerman provides harrowing video and gripping testimony revealing what residents of the northwestern Bahamas endured.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "September At Pm", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
