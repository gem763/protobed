The Murdock Crossing and Stoney areas are still under a mandatory evacuation on orders from the Plumas County Sheriff, though all other areas previously under mandatory evacuation have been reduced to an advisory-evacuation level.\n\nOn Sept. 8, the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 took a photo of the Walker Fire with the combination of natural color overlaid with false-color composite to further emphasize the burned areas, according to NASA.\n\nThe Walker Fire has been burning in northern California since Sept. 4, 2019, and had engulfed more than 50,000 acres as of Sept. 15.

A red flag warning remains in effect from Sunday morning through mid-morning on Monday.\n\n\"As much as 0.50 of an inch of rain can fall on the Walker fire,\" Duff said. \"There can be a period of gusty winds prior to the dousing rainfall that can fan the flames and cause erratic wildfire behavior. Wind gusts can reach 30-45 mph into Monday.\"\n\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nThe single largest recorded wildfire on record for California was the Ranch Fire, which burned 410,203 acres in 2018. The Ranch Fire was a part of the larger Mendocino Complex Fire along with the River Fire, combining to become the largest recorded fire complex in the history of California.
