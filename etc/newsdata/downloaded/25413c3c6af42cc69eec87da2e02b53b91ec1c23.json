The president focused on condemning the whistleblower, lambasting the media and bragging about the size of his political rallies.\n\nBelow is a transcript from a 9-minute video of Trump\u2019s remarks obtained by The Washington Post. The video begins as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft leaves the stage and Trump takes the podium:\n\n\u201cThey tell you you\u2019re going to be a star, the only way you\u2019re going to be a star, no matter how you look or feel or talk is when you make good deals. I found that out over the years, you\u2019ve got to make good deals otherwise it\u2019s over. And [Craft] is going to make great deals.\n\nI was with her now for three days and she\u2019s developed incredible relationships in a very short period of time and we appreciate it. (Looks at her) You\u2019ll be out there. You\u2019ll be in the firing line today for us. For instance, today I just heard while I\u2019m coming up here, you know they have a whistleblower (laughter) he turned out to be a fake, he\u2019s a fake, a highly partisan whistleblower. The lawyer contributed to Biden, they contributed to \u2014 the whole thing is \u2014 but more importantly, you know what the whistleblower [complaint] is? The same letter that we announced yesterday, which was perfect, I couldn\u2019t have written it better if I wrote it myself. I could not have said or had a better conversation.\n\nAnd we had a really nice gentleman in the president of Ukraine yesterday. And he was, he was good. They said, \u2018Was he pressuring you?\u2019 You know, these animals in the press. They\u2019re animals. Some of the worst human beings you\u2019ll ever meet. (An audience member yells: \u201cFake news!\u201d) They\u2019re scum, many of them are scum. You have some good reporters, but not many I\u2019ll be honest with you. And that\u2019s one of the things we battle. (Looks at Craft) You\u2019ll find out, but they\u2019ll probably like you better than they like me, but I had to get us here right?\n\nThey are total, just terrible dishonest people. And they were crazy \u2014 they couldn\u2019t figure out, \u2018what do we say bad about this conversation?\u2019 Then it turns out they had senators, Democrat senators who went over there and strong-armed the guy: \u201cYou better damn well do this or you\u2019re not going to get any money from Congress.\u201d Oh I see, that\u2019s O.K.? And then you have Sleepy Joe Biden, who\u2019s dumb as a rock. (laughter)\n\nThis guy was dumb on his best day, and he\u2019s not having his best day right now. He\u2019s dumb as a rock. So you have Sleepy Joe, and he goes up, and his kid, who\u2019s got a lot of problems, he got thrown out of the Navy for problems. I mean, look, I\u2019m not going to \u2014 it\u2019s a problem, that\u2019s a problem, so we won\u2019t get into why and all that. But he got thrown out of the Navy, and now this kid goes into Ukraine, walks away with millions of dollars, and he becomes a consultant for $50,000 a month. And he doesn\u2019t know anything compared to anybody in this room. Ok? He\u2019s a stiff, he knows nothing. He\u2019s walking away with $50,000, or as you would say in the old days 50K a month. Not bad. Would anybody else in this room like to represent Ukraine for $50,000?\n\nThat\u2019s on top (points to the audience and says, you got the job) that\u2019s on top of hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars. But that\u2019s not the best one. The best one was China. This came up. So now he goes to China, and I was with the head of Blackstone which is the big deal. Steve Schwarzman. I said, \u201cSteve, is that possible?\u201d \u201cNo, why? Why? Who got that? Who got that?\u201d I said. \u201cBiden\u2019s son.\u201d \u201cOoh,\u201d Well, then, you know, he says, \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t get involved, you know it\u2019s very political.\u201d I say, \u201cSteve, what happens when you come off a vice presidential plane, it\u2019s called Air Force Two, your father\u2019s with you, you walk into a room in China and they give you a fund of $1.5 billion, billion, you make hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars off that. And that\u2019s probably not all they gave him. They gave him plenty more, I\u2019m sure. We might never find out.\n\nAnd then they talk about me, and I didn\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the most innocent person in the world. But, you know, you look at that \u2014 most presidential, I\u2019m the most presidential, except for possibly Abe Lincoln when he wore the hat \u2014 that was tough to beat.\n\nRemember we used to do that during the campaign. They used to say, when I speak, the crowd would be crazy, I\u2019d go crazy \u2014 we would all go crazy. We\u2019re going to have a lot of fun together \u2026 We\u2019ve never had an empty seat. From the day I came down the escalator, with a potential unbelievable woman who became our first lady [applause] \u2026 the crowds love her, the people love her. But we\u2019ve never had an empty seat \u2014 not one. I really believe that.\n\nThere was one case where we had a tremendous snowstorm and it was just about frozen, it was a monster storm. I don\u2019t even remember how we got there. I said, \u2018How\u2019s the crowd?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s just about full, sir.\u2019 I said, \u2018What does that mean, like there are about two seats on top. Thousands and thousands could get there. So they show pictures of the empty seats. They don\u2019t say this is the worst storm they\u2019ve had in years. They show pictures of like nine empty seats and it could\u2019ve been people who just went to the bathroom.\n\nI always say, just get the biggest arena. Good location if you can, but get the biggest arena. We did it the other night. Tuesday night we had two congressmen. One was possibly going to win. He was up by two. He won by about 27, I think, or something like that \u2014 a lot. The other one was down by 17. And they said, \u2018Sir, don\u2019t campaign for him please.\u2019 Why? \u2018Because if he loses they\u2019re going to kill you in the press.\u2019 I said they\u2019re going to kill me whether I campaign or not. It\u2019s not going to matter. It\u2019ll make it a little bit worse. They\u2019ll say, he worked and he failed. Trump failed. The guy was down 17 points and he ended up winning by a lot. He ended up winning by a lot.\n\nIn fact the whole night, CNN built the most beautiful, $2 billion maybe they spent, no wonder they\u2019re losing \u2026 they have no ratings and they\u2019re building studios all over the place, but they had a studio. The studio was going to stay up for weeks. And toward the end of the night they were taking it down. The so called stars were leaving. They\u2019re not really stars, I\u2019ll tell you. The stars were leaving and they didn\u2019t want to report it.\n\nThe candidate Dan Bishop won by a lot. He was down by 17, and they had lines a mile long. I mean the lines going into those voting booths were unbelievable. And without the rally speech, and a couple of tweets, and Twitter stuff is good. We have, like, way over 100 million people on six or seven different platforms. It\u2019s actually much higher than that, even, higher than just about everybody. And it helps. It helps. They have signs oftentimes when I speak. It said, please keep .... This woman the other night, beautiful woman, she\u2019s got a son: \u201cPlease keep tweeting sir, it matters.\u201d And it does matter, because we get our voice out. If we don\u2019t do that, we don\u2019t get the voice out.\n\nI can\u2019t say what a great job Kelly [Craft] is doing, and I can\u2019t say what a wonderful husband he is [pointing to Joe Craft]. Look at how devoted he is. He\u2019s a rich man, too. He\u2019s loaded. What are you doing here? Why aren\u2019t you working? He\u2019s so proud of his wife he can\u2019t leave his office. That\u2019s really great though, huh? Are you all proud of her? He said very much. And he\u2019s really a fantastic guy, he\u2019s been a friend of mine for a long time. Before I met Kelly, I met Joe. And Joe impressed me because of his knowledge of energy. Now he could be paid. O.K., you\u2019re going to pay a guy 50 \u2026 for him that\u2019s not quite good enough, although he might. He might. It\u2019s easy money, Joe, you have to say. But he would be an expert on energy, he would be a real expert. He would be somebody you would pay a lot of money to, but not Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nSo the whistleblower came out and said nothing. Said, \u201ca couple of people told me he had a conversation with Ukraine.\u201d We\u2019re at war. These people are sick. They\u2019re sick. And nobody\u2019s called it out like I do. I don\u2019t understand. People are afraid to call it out. They\u2019re afraid to say that the press is crooked. We have a crooked press. We have a dishonest media. So now they\u2019re devastated, but they\u2019ll always find something. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be something they\u2019ll find in this report that will suit their lie. But basically that person never saw the report, never saw the call. Never saw the call. Heard something, and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is \u2014 sort of like almost a spy. I want to know who\u2019s the person that gave the whistle-blower, who\u2019s the person that gave the whistleblower the information, because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right?\n\n...\n\n(He then said, \u201cWe used to handle them a little differently than we do now,\u201d according to a recording of the remarks obtained by the Los Angeles Times.)", "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the most innocent person in the world.
