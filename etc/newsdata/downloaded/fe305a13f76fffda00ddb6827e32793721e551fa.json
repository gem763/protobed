Vigil, is presented as a mere bipartisan assessment of the public images of both women.\n\nBut it thinly veils its criticism of one and its admiration of the other. No prizes for guessing who\u2019s who.\n\nVigil, a Boston academic, notes that Melania \u201cranks among the least liked of all modern first ladies, [and her] professional life prepared her to serve more as a visual adornment.\u201d\n\nThe afterword belatedly acknowledges that \u201cpitting the two women against one another is a troublesome (though common) practice.\u201d\n\nBut, hey, if it damages the Trumps, go for it.\n\nThe Daily News got the message about who is more impressive: \u201cMichelle was a polished attorney and huge asset to Barack; Melania, a top model, is nearly invisible,\u201d goes the headline promoting the book.\n\nVigil declares that Melania\u2019s \u201cdifficulties\u201d are exacerbated because she \u201cfollowed a popular and competent first lady\u201d in Michelle Obama.\n\nAfter writing an entire book comparing the two first ladies \u2014 one only halfway through her first term with a wildly hostile media and the other who completed two terms \u2014 Vigil concedes that \u201cdirectly contrasting these women is fraught with challenges.\u201d\n\nNo kidding.\n\nThere is a good reason Melania, 49, might be \u201caloof\u201d with the media, and that is because the attacks on her are more vicious, personal and unrelenting than any first lady has endured.\n\nWhatever you think of her husband, you can\u2019t say she has behaved with anything but dignity in her role, despite ugly provocations, which include attacks on her young son, Barron.\n\nWhen it comes to the former Ms. Knauss, there are no boundaries to bullying at all.\n\nHer Christmas decorations have been pilloried, her accent mocked. She has been depicted as a victim of domestic abuse.\n\nWhen she visited a hospital after the El Paso massacre and cradled an orphaned baby with a smile, she was slammed for insensitivity.\n\nWhen she recited the Lord\u2019s Prayer at one of Trump\u2019s rallies, she was branded a \u201cwhore.\u201d\n\nJust last week, an entire story ran in Newsweek claiming President Trump had called her to his side like a dog, with three taps on his thigh.\n\nClearly, since the president has proven impervious to abuse, his enemies want to get at him through his wife.\n\nMelania is right to regard herself as one of the \u201cmost bullied people in the world,\u201d as she once told CNN.\n\nThere is nothing she can do right in the eyes of media gatekeepers.\n\nDespite her exquisite style and promotion of American brands, she has been snubbed by fashion\u2019s elite. Vogue editor Anna Wintour recently dissed her by pointedly praising Michelle Obama\u2019s style when asked about Melania.\n\nDoes she deserve no respect because of the man she married?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to occur to Melania\u2019s critics that, rather than being a docile Stepford wife, she might actually share her husband\u2019s political worldview and encourage his policy positions on such topics as illegal immigration.\n\nBut, unlike Hillary Clinton, whose aggressive foray into health care policy when she was first lady caused considerable political fallout for her husband, Melania doesn\u2019t flaunt her influence.\n\nMichelle Obama was a fine first lady and deserves plaudits for writing a bestselling memoir since. But her school lunch interventions showed she was an elitist nanny-stater at heart.\n\nMelania has not committed the same errors of arrogant overreach. She has the humility to understand that she is not the main game. Such command of ego is the first requirement of a first lady.\n\nMelania is much more than an airhead former model, in any case.\n\nFor starters, she speaks six languages: her native Slovenian, English, French, Serbian, German and Italian.\n\nShe may not have finished college, but she had the street smarts to escape her tiny town in an impoverished Eastern Bloc country and survive on her wits in America. She\u2019s no political na\u00eff, either: If your family has experienced communism firsthand, you have a pretty attuned sense of politics and ideology.\n\nAt the recent G-7 in France, she did not put a foot wrong.\n\nWith the eyes of the world on you, it must be nerve-wracking to ensure you don\u2019t trip or have a wardrobe malfunction or say something silly to embarrass your husband and nation. Anyone who has accompanied a spouse to an important business function would know the pressure.\n\nBut Melania always looked lovely and engaged charmingly with world leaders. She kissed Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau on the cheek (and was accused, weirdly, of coming on to him). On an excursion to a Biarritz beach, she got on so well with French first lady Brigitte Macron, they wound up holding hands.\n\nThe inclusion of spouses makes these international powwows as much about personal relationships as highfalutin\u2019 policy, and Melania\u2019s schmoozing ability is an asset that shouldn\u2019t be underrated.\n\nShe is a woman whose poise and dignity speaks volumes.\n\nWhen people say, \u201cPoor Melania,\u201d she says, \u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me. I can handle everything.\u201d\n\nAny honest assessment of her track record would tell you there\u2019s no doubt she can handle anything. The Trump haters will have to find a new victim.\n\nTake a hike, tour buses\n\nTopView\u2019s big red double-decker tourist buses and their pushy tours are a menace in Midtown.\n\nAll hours of the day and night through summer, they clog intersections on Eighth Avenue while their customers jam sidewalks.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to accept that the tourist heart of the city will be crowded. It\u2019s quite another for innocent pedestrians to be brought to a standstill with no feasible way of breaking through the human crush unless they elbow someone.\n\nI just don\u2019t see why the tours need to ply their trade so aggressively in the middle of the sidewalk. Surely, their buses, at least, could idle somewhere less trafficked, like 10th Avenue, and their customers could walk a couple of blocks. The bus company is leeching off the amenity of everyone else trying to use the sidewalk. Time to find another parking lot.\n\nHollywood\u2019s enemies list\n\nWitness Hollywood\u2019s new \u00adMcCarthyism. \u201cWill & Grace\u201d stars Debra Messing and Eric McCormack could just have boycotted a fundraiser for President Trump next month if they don\u2019t like Republicans.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough for the Tolerance Taliban. They want the names of anyone who does show up at the fundraiser so they can be blacklisted.\n\n\u201cPlease print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know,\u201d Messing tweeted Friday in response to a Hollywood Reporter story about the Emmy-week function.\n\nMcCormack piled on, \u201cKindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s sinister that high-profile entertainers could harbor such illiberal instincts and have no shame about displaying them for all to see. But the most damage they do is to their own credibility.\n\nTrouble brewing\n\nWhen a Starbucks employee in Philadelphia wrote the wrong name on a coffee order, a man in Islamic dress cried Islamophobia \u2014 but when did Starbucks ever get a name right? Behind a noisy coffee machine in a busy store, it\u2019s easy to misunderstand a customer\u2019s mumbled order. Who\u2019s to say that when Niquel Johnson gave his name as \u201cAzis,\u201d it didn\u2019t sound just like \u201cISIS\u201d?
