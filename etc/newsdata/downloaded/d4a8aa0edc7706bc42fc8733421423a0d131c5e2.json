Whistleblowers, specifically within the intelligence community, are vulnerable to retaliation and having their security clearance revoked, which could hinder their ability to secure a job in the IC in the future.\n\nOn Wednesday, attorneys for the whistleblower rejected reports that their client had a \"professional relationship\" with a Democratic presidential candidate. \"First, our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party,\" they said in a statement. \"Second, our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch. Third, in these positions our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials \u2013 not as candidates.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the president knows the whistleblower\u2019s name. His confidants are certainly interested; one person close to the president said he would like to find out the whistleblower\u2019s identity, describing him as \u201ca political operator\u201d who seems to be part of \u201ca coordinated campaign.\u201d\n\nBut if Trump learned the name, he could choose to release it in the name of \u201ctransparency\u201d if he wishes, said McCullough. \u201cIt\u2019d be a gross attack against the intelligence oversight system, especially given the chilling effect that release would create, but it\u2019s within his power to launch that attack.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating war on the whistleblower who raised concerns over his July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president is exposing what experts say are flaws in current law, which doesn\u2019t sufficiently protect whistleblowers from being publicly identified and harassed.
