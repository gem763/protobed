It has also risen 86.4 cents since the start of the year. What is more troubling is that as California gas prices reached the highest level in the state since 2015, some Los Angeles area gas stations are charging more than $5 a gallon.\n\nThe gas price spike started last month after Saudi Arabia oil production facilities were attacked, and accelerated after three Los Angeles-area refineries slowed or halted production due to maintenance issues and no imported gasoline was available to make up for the shortfall, according to Jeffrey Spring, the Automobile Club of Southern California's corporate communications manager.\n\nThe shortage was made worse after local refineries cut back production of summer-blend gasoline in anticipation of switching to selling the winter blend beginning Nov. 1.\n\nBut wait, there's more: America's most \"environmentally conscious\" state got a harsh lesson in electrical engineering when many of the tens of thousands of people hit by this week's blackout learned the hard way that solar installations don't keep the lights on during a power outage.\n\nRelated: Largest Oil Traders: Oil Prices Aren\u2019t Going Anywhere\n\nThat, as Bloomberg reports, is \"because most panels are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to houses. During the heat of the day, solar systems generate more juice than a home can handle. However, they don\u2019t produce power at all at night. So systems are tied into the grid, and the vast majority aren\u2019t working this week as PG&E cut power to much of Northern California to prevent wildfires.\"\n\nOf course, the only way for most solar panels to work during a blackout is pairing them with batteries, however as Tesla has found out the hard way, that market is just starting to take off and even so it's having a very difficult time making headway. The largest U.S. rooftop solar company, Sunrun, said hundreds of its customers are making it through the blackouts with batteries. Alas, the total number of those affected - and without power - is in the hundreds of thousands.\n\n\"It\u2019s the perfect combination for getting through these shutdowns,\" Sunrun Chairman Ed Fenster said in an interview. He expects battery sales to boom in the wake of the outages.\n\nFor those wondering if their appliances can work of the power generated by a Tesla, the answer is no, at least without special equipment. Incidentally, without electricity, a Tesla itself won't run. So those Californians who still have \"uncool\" internal combustion engines are in luck; they just may have to pay nearly $6 per gallon soon to fill up.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Millions of Californians may have just suffered an unprecedented, induced blackout by the state's largest (and bankrupt) utility, and on top of that gasoline prices are soaring too", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tsozweZuDvdbR0Mh_0fCag--~B/aD00NTA7dz0yMDc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/9b81d23d945d25961ac30a60f405547d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
