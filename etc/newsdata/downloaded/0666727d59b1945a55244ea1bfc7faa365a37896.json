The Conservative Party also called for his withdrawal.\n\nLater that day, the Liberal Party said Guillet's \"insensitive comments\" don't align with the party's values and revoked his candidacy in the riding of Saint-L\u00e9onard\u2014Saint-Michel.\n\nGuillet held a press conference in the riding on Wednesday, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with supporters. He said the party was aware of the contents of his Facebook page since at least Aug. 8 and already had discussed an action plan that involved reaching out to the Jewish community.\n\nGuillet, a member of the Council of Quebec Imams who gained national attention after delivering a speech in Quebec City honouring victims of the Quebec mosque shooting, said he did congratulate Salah after he was released from prison because he had protested the closure of a Jerusalem mosque, but insisted he wasn't aware of his background.\n\nLiberals say decision is final\n\n\"The party either knew or should have known what it contained. Why, then, if these words were so problematic, why was my candidacy ... accepted?\" he said. \"One is entitled to ask the question, was it incompetence or bad faith?\n\n\"I am not anti-Semitic. On the contrary, I campaigned and I will always campaign against all forms of racism, including Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.\"\n\nGuillet said a member of the Liberal Party approached him Friday and said he could resign for personal reasons \u2014 or the party would withdraw its support.\n\nThe Liberal Party isn't changing its mind.\n\n\"Following an internal review, the Liberal Party of Canada took the appropriate steps to remove Mr. Guillet as the Liberal candidate for the riding of Saint-L\u00e9onard\u2014Saint-Michel. That decision is final,\" said party spokesperson Parker Lund in an email Wednesday.\n\nNeither is B'nai Brith Canada.\n\n\"Today's press conference only confirms our position that Hassan Guillet is not fit to carry the Liberal Party banner,\" said Michael Mostyn, the group's chief executive officer.\n\n\"We are satisfied with our role in exposing his anti-Semitic statements, and disappointed that he spurned an opportunity to retract them.\"", "description": "Ousted Liberal candidate Hassan Guillet admits to posting online about a\u00a0Hamas-aligned activist, but\u00a0says\u00a0the party was well aware of his comments\u00a0before they\u00a0withdrew his nomination.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5270449.1567623166!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fed-elxn-guillet-liberal-20190904.jpg"}
