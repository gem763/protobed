Now it faces a new cost \u2013 a slump in the lucrative tourist business in its hugely popular capital, Barcelona.\n\nThe violent disturbances left the city with a clean-up bill estimated at \u20ac3m (\u00a32.6m), but it is feared that the images of airport chaos, running battles with police and flaming barricades will cost a great deal more.\n\nThe tourism association, Barcelona Oberta, estimates that economic activity in the city centre \u2013 from shops, hotels and restaurants \u2013 fell by between 30% and 50% in the week after the leaders were sentenced, either because fearful customers stayed away or businesses closed to avoid being looted.\n\nRoger Pallarols, president of Barcelona restaurateurs association, said that in the areas directly affected trade fell by around 60%. About 70 restaurants had their outdoor terraces destroyed as rioters burned chairs and parasols on the barricades, causing around \u20ac2m in damage to property. \u201cThings are quiet now but if this continues restaurants will have to lay off staff because the profit margins are very small,\u201d he said.\n\nSome of the worst rioting was in Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, an upmarket shopping street, where about 60% of sales are to tourists. \u201cSales were down around 30% over the week,\u201d said Luis Sans, president of the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia association. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a return to normality now but the short term is one thing \u2013 another is the effect these images will have had on people\u2019s desire to come to Barcelona. There was a lot of damage but at least, unlike the gilets jaunes in Paris, the demonstrators, didn\u2019t set out to destroy shops and restaurants.\u201d\n\nManel Casals, head of the Barcelona hoteliers association, said there had been cancellations and the number of bookings was down. The same is happening with Airbnb and similar platforms. According to AirDNA, a consultancy for the short-term rental sector, reservations for the week from 14 October were down by nearly 1,000 on a year earlier, at 11,537.\n\nTourism accounts for 15% of Barcelona\u2019s economy and employs around 100,000 people, 40,000 of them directly. The hotel business alone has a turnover of \u20ac1.6bn.\n\nBarcelona is also one of the world\u2019s most popular conference venues. The biggest money-spinner is the Mobile World Conference. Last year the 100,000 visitors to the telecoms congress spent \u20ac473m while creating 14,000 temporary jobs. Its contract with the city expires in 2023.\n\n\u201cConferences are organised a long way in advance, and aside from an American convention I don\u2019t know of any cancellations,\u201d said Christoph Tessmar, director of the Barcelona tourism convention bureau. But he warned: \u201cThe images we\u2019ve seen in recent days could have a negative impact in the short term.\u201d\n\nBarcelona is also the cruise capital of the Mediterranean. At least three vessels carrying a total of 6,000 passengers opted not to dock in the city. According to the government, ports, railways and airports between them have lost around \u20ac4m. Altogether, about 175,000 travellers were affected by cancellations or delays caused by road blocks.\n\nFor now, everyone is banking on Barcelona\u2019s famed resilience. In 2017, when the city was rocked by both a terrorist attack and the illegal declaration of independence, thousands of businesses moved their headquarters out of Catalonia. However, the city bounced back.\n\n\u201cThese events can damage the city\u2019s image but this conflict isn\u2019t going to continue for ever and we\u2019ll get back to normal,\u201d said Gabriel Jen\u00e9, president of Barcelona Oberta. \u201cWe\u2019re more worried about the ability of politicians to deal with the conflict than the capacity of the city to overcome it.\u201d", "description": "Hoteliers, restaurants and shops say takings fell up to 50% after the violence, and future bookings may be hit", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc9d795838ab9c83d2028736c05fbf98191f2a5/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6d675cab2f4518b07421f550a750784a", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
