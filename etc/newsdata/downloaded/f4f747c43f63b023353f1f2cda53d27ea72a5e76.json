The real-estate developer stands near the patio of a Cordon Bleu\u2013trained chef\u2019s mountainside eatery and gets indigestion just thinking about what a mess homebuilding has become.\n\n\u201cI have to spend $80,000 before I can drive one nail into a piece of wood,\u201d Green says. Just preparing to manufacture a house can take four to five months. This includes permits, land-use studies, appealing to various boards, and pleading with politicians. How long did he wait to reach this starting line when he began in this business in the late 1990s? \u201cThree to four weeks.\u201d Thus, he has seen a five- to seven-fold increase in the time needed to launch projects in just two decades.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn fact, \"Jack Green\" is a pseudonym by which to shield this gentleman\u2019s identity, as he requests, \"since I still deal with these people.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGreen once aspired to create 60 homes on land that he purchased. By the time officials finished with him, he actually wound up creating only 13 homes, a 78 percent decrease in planned housing stock. Since he had fewer homes to sell, his asking price per dwelling soared 233 percent \u2014 from roughly $300,000 to $700,000. \u201cAnd you wonder why homes have become unaffordable?\u201d he asks.\n\nGreen recollects another project in which he got his paperwork in order, and all systems were go. \u201cAt the last minute, an official told me, \u2018We need a streetlight at a certain corner,\u2019\u201d Green recalls. \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s nice. But I don\u2019t see that in any of the approvals, plans, or anything else.\u2019\u201d\n\nBasically, the functionary told Green that the city wanted that streetlight installed, and Green had to pay for it. He threatened to sue. \u201c\u2018No, you won\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Green says the official told him. \u201c\u2018You want to build this project, and you need our final approval. And you won\u2019t get it until that streetlight gets built.\u2019\u201d Green replied: \u201cThat\u2019s extortion.\u201d According to the builder, the bureaucrat said:\n\n\u201cYes, it is.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DEROY MURDOCK", "description": "Red tape is making it more costly for Americans to purchase homes.", "authors": ["Deroy Murdock"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/28/694940094001_6078738007001_6078434114001-vs.jpg"}
