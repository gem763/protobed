The project is sensitive because of its proximity to Andean glaciers and the Chilean capital.\n\n\u201cAll of our data proves we can mine that resource without doing any damage to the glaciers and without affecting the ground water,\u201d he said at the company\u2019s offices in Santiago ahead of the Cesco Week mining conference. \u201cWe will not mine it if there are any other indications; we will not take the project forward.\u201d\n\nThe Los Bronces project is part of Anglo American\u2019s plan to expand its portfolio of copper assets organically, Faul said. Last year, the company started construction of the $5bn Quellaveco mine in Peru, one of the few large copper mines being built at the moment.\n\nProduction at Los Bronces - the largest copper mine operated by the globe-straddling company - will decline in five years as ore grades decrease. The output expansion at the site, which has been mined for over 150 years, could take annual production from 369 500 tons last year to about 400 000. The company plans to use new technology to increase efficiency and to dig underground tunnels to avoid impact on the nearby glaciers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this for six years and we trust we have the best scientific input,\u201d Faul said of the Los Bronces plans.\n\nAbout 80% of South America\u2019s glaciers are in Chile, and they cover about 3% of the country\u2019s land area. Rising temperatures combined with mining activity have sped up the melting of Andean glaciers, Francisco Ferrando, a geography professor at University of Chile in Santiago, said in June.\n\nThe Juncal Norte and Olivares Alfa glaciers, about 4 000 meters above sea level and close to Los Bronces and Codelco\u2019s Andina mine, are melting at a faster pace than others further away, he said.\n\nTime Frame\n\nFaul expects it will take about three years to obtain the necessary permits for the project, including the environmental license. Project development would take four years, and ramp up a further five years. A lot could happen during that time, especially as glacier protection and the impact of mining on the delicate Andean environment are being discussed in Chile\u2019s Congress.\n\nThe two mines are just about 65 kilometers away from Santiago, home to over 5 million people, about a third of the Chilean population. Developments around Los Bronces and the glaciers nearby are closely watched by local communities and large environmental groups such as Greenpeace, which opposes industrial and mining activities on or under glaciers.\n\nLast year, Codelco announced a re-design of a planned expansion at Andina that would have involved mining on six rock glaciers. The new plan will move mining activities away from glaciers following direct orders from Codelco Chief Executive Officer Nelson Pizarro not to work near the glaciers, the mine\u2019s sustainability manager Jorge Sanhueza said at the time.\n\nAnglo wants to start discussions about its Los Bronces plans with local communities during the second quarter, Faul said. But the project won\u2019t happen if there\u2019s significant opposition.\n\n\u201cIf the public protests against it, we can\u2019t take that forward,\u201d Faul said. \u201cWe can\u2019t force anyone\u2019s arm.\u201d", "description": "Anglo American will scrap its next big copper project if studies indicate the plan could harm nearby glaciers or there\u2019s major opposition from local communities in Chile, a top executive says.", "authors": ["Laura Millan Lombrana"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8462/ee798b69457d4be6bfc902a34dcbf029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-09"}
