(Photo by Alika Jenner/Getty Images)\n\nA trick play that No. 25 Washington ran in the first half against No. 12 Oregon was apparently too tricky.\n\nAfter Oregon took a 7-0 lead, Washington used a bit of deception to return the ensuing kickoff out to midfield. Receiver Aaron Fuller fielded the kickoff, ran a few yards upfield and then threw the ball across the field to teammate Chico McClatcher. Because the throw was a lateral, the speedy McClatcher was able to advance the ball to midfield, catching Oregon\u2019s kickoff team off guard.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut McClatcher had plenty of room to run because he actually was laying down on his stomach in the end zone when Fuller fielded the ball. According to the Pac-12 officiating crew, that bit of deception \u2014 \u201claying in the end zone,\u201d as the official described it \u2014 was worthy of a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct\n\n(via ABC)\n\nIf you\u2019re confused as to why exactly laying down in the end zone is a penalty, ESPN rules expert Bill Lemonnier said it\u2019s a fairly new addition to the rule book.\n\n\u201cOne of the things they put in a year or two ago was you cannot take a player and lay him down to decoy like he\u2019s not on the field,\u201d Lemonnier said on the ABC broadcast. \u201cAnd he laid down in the end zone to blend in with the end zone so the kicking team couldn\u2019t see him. Then he got up. He\u2019s the guy that caught the backward pass. That\u2019s why it\u2019s an unsportsmanlike conduct foul. It was instituted a couple years ago because so many of the teams were doing deceptive things in relation to the color of their jerseys laying in the end zone.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThat specific example Lemonnier, a longtime Big Ten referee, referenced is not listed in the FBS rule book\u2019s section on unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. However, the rule book does have an article on \u201cunfair acts\u201d that says \u201can obviously unfair act not specifically covered by the rules\u201d can result in an unsportsmanlike conduct foul.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the same play from teams in recent years, including Oregon State in 2018. OSU was not flagged.\n\nHow's this for a special teams wrinkle?#GoBeavs pic.twitter.com/LLcCP871Io \u2014 Oregon State Football (@BeaverFootball) October 7, 2018\n\nOn Saturday, Oregon was able to kickoff again because of the penalty on Washington. The second kickoff went for a touchback and Washington took over at its own 25.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "A trick play that Washington ran in the first half against Oregon was apparently too tricky.", "authors": ["Sam Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VDvGOYv1sCg9t5XtclG9TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o9ztB33AuXBRTOywLXy31Q--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/f40cd420-f2b3-11e9-bfb9-5158bab234b2", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
