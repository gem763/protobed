In it, the union alleges Boeing misrepresented the safety of the 737 MAX aircraft to Southwest pilots.\n\n\u201cSWAPA pilots agreed to fly the 737 MAX aircraft based on Boeing\u2019s representations that it was airworthy and essentially the same as the time-tested 737 aircraft that its pilots have flown for years. These representations were false,\u201d the union\u2019s statement reads.\n\nIt continues: \u201cBoeing\u2019s errors cost the lives of 346 people, damaged the critical bond between pilots and passengers, and reduced opportunities for air travel across the United States and around the world.\u201d\n\nThe 737 MAX planes were grounded following two deadly crashes \u2015 on Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights earlier this year \u2015 along with a host of unresolved safety concerns.\n\nSWAPA said that grounding caused the cancellation of 30,000 scheduled Southwest flights and wage losses of over $100 million for the airline\u2019s pilots.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said he believed the lawsuit was \u201cmeritless.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we value our long relationship with SWAPA, we believe this lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it,\u201d Bickers said.\n\nSouthwest customers filed a lawsuit against the airline and Boeing in July, alleging the two companies colluded to hide a design defect in the jet. The claim also accused Southwest of defrauding its customers and regulators, as well as its own pilots and employees.\n\nSWAPA president Captain Jon Weaks said the pilots\u2019 greatest concern is \u201cthe safety of our passengers\u201d in a statement on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe have to be able to trust Boeing to truthfully disclose the information we need to safely operate our aircraft,\u201d Weaks said. \u201cIn the case of the 737 MAX, that absolutely did not happen.\u201d\n\nRead the complaint below:\n\nRelated coverage\n\nBoeing Engineer Filed Internal Safety Complaint About 737 Max: Reports\n\nLove HuffPost?
