In retrospect, the canceled initial public offering by WeWork\u2019s parent We Co. seems inevitable, given its $17.32 billion in net debt and negative free cash flow of $2.94 billion in the year through June. By contrast, Aramco\u2019s $88.49 billion of free cash flow and $5.55 billion in cash net of debt suggest there\u2019s still plenty to tempt investors.\n\nYet the two abortive share sales have a core attribute in common. In both cases, powerful insider interest groups came to the process with an elevated idea of the valuation they could achieve, and backed away when reality refused to conform to their expectations.\n\nBankers put the Aramco sale on hold last week after it became clear that international investors wouldn\u2019t swallow the $2 trillion market capitalization Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first laid out almost three-and-a-half years ago, Bloomberg News reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. A number closer to $1.5 trillion looked more viable, one of the people said, and even that reduced number was some way above the more realistic figures in the $1 trillion range calculated by my colleague Liam Denning.\n\nIf writing off the equivalent value of Tesla Inc. was disappointing for WeWork and its key investor SoftBank Group Corp., it\u2019s no surprise that Prince Mohammed is balking at seeing an Amazon.com Inc.-worth of value disappear at the click of a banker\u2019s spreadsheet. Still, letting markets pass the verdict on valuation is what IPOs are meant to be about. If Prince Mohammed ever wants to get this share sale away, he should take their skepticism as a cue for reflection, not rejection.\n\nFor one thing, valuations just aren\u2019t what they were when the idea of an Aramco IPO was first mooted back in early 2016. On an enterprise-value-to-Ebitda multiple, major listed independent and state-controlled oil companies are running at about a 29% discount to the valuations they were enjoying in April that year, when Prince Mohammed first put a number on Aramco\u2019s market cap. Aramco\u2019s cash and debt holdings are nugatory next to its vast cash flows, so you can translate that into a roughly $600 billion discount off the equity value it might have got at the time. Value Aramco\u2019s $216.6 billion in Ebitda on the median multiple of the major listed national oil companies and you\u2019re looking at a number just shy of $900 billion.\n\nThe problems are compounded by the way the IPO has been handled. One reason the state oil companies mostly trade at a discount to independent producers is the perception that their corporate governance is caught up in politics. Aramco is hardly immune: Just last month, Khalid Al-Falih was removed from the roles of Aramco chairman and Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister in the space of a week. In the first role, he was replaced by Yasir Al-Rumayyan, a SoftBank director and the head of the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which will become Aramco\u2019s largest shareholder once the IPO is completed. In the latter, his place was taken by one of Prince Mohammed\u2019s half-brothers.\n\nNeither move suggests the sort of insulation from insider considerations that would convince shareholders to give a generous multiple to Aramco \u2014 and in terms of political risk, there\u2019s the whole matter of a cold war with Iran, drone strikes on oil facilities, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s position as the swing producer for the entire oil market to consider, too.\n\nAramco has one giant advantage over WeWork. Thanks to those enormous cash flows, there\u2019s really no reason that it needs an IPO. Without an infusion of investor cash, WeWork may struggle to make it through the next quarter. Aramco could, in theory, keep going in its current fashion for decades.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said of the state with which it\u2019s intertwined. The Saudi government needs an oil price of $78 a barrel to balance its budget, according to the International Monetary Fund, a level last seen in 2014. Running a fiscal deficit won\u2019t be the end of the world, but in the long run the country still has a wicked problem. It must find a path to a sustainable economy in a world where its population is rising even as demand for oil must start to fall if the the worst effects of climate change are to be avoided.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On paper, you could scarcely imagine two more different companies than WeWork and Saudi Aramco.\u00a0The serviced-office startup is a notorious cash sink, while Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is a gusher of dollars.
