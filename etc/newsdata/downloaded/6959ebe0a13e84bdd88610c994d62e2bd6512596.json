Jerry McNerney (D-CA) stressed the importance of regulators being more informed about new technology: \"How can we best use resources? We need the expertise within the government to manage these developments as they come.\"\n\nstressed the importance of regulators being more informed about new technology: \"How can we best use resources?

Axios: Chuck Kennedy for Axios\n\nThe conversation also highlighted who is most impacted by technological development in AI, and the importance of future-proofing employment across all industries. As AI is something that touches all industries, the importance of centering the human experience in creating solutions was stressed at multiple points in the conversation.\n\nWilliam Carter, Deputy Director and Fellow at the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, highlighted the importance of future-proofing systems: \" Creating trust is more than regulation and mediating algorithmic risk.

You need that infrastructure whether or not you\u2019re using AI.
