To be fair, Joe Biden has stated publicly that he doesn\u2019t want help from super-PACs to campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. However, Biden\u2019s overall fundraising incompetence has Democratic institutional donors worried about whether Biden can make it to the finish line financially, CNN reports:\n\nA coalition of top Democratic strategists and donors are intensifying conversations about setting up an outside group to bolster Joe Biden\u2019s presidential candidacy, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, aiming to create a super PAC designed to fight back against a barrage of well-funded attacks from President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. The idea of building an outside organization has been the subject of discussion for weeks by Biden allies, but the conversations intensified in the wake of a cash crunch for the former vice president\u2019s campaign. He reported last week having less than $9 million in the bank, significantly less than his leading rivals.\n\nThe optics would look terrible, but Biden\u2019s backers might not have much of a choice. His team has relied on big-ticket donors to the point where many of them can\u2019t kick in any more cash directly to the campaign. In fact, as Politico reports this morning, Biden is the leading candidate for donations of $500 or more, and that\u2019s the problem:\n\nBiden has raised $20.7 million from contributions of at least $500 \u2014 $1.5 million more than his nearest competitor, despite entering the race later than all of them \u2014 thanks to the former vice president\u2019s strong connections and goodwill among the traditional donors who have long financed the Democratic Party. Biden drew donations from 114 former big money fundraisers for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in the third quarter, the most of any Democrat, according to a POLITICO analysis. But it\u2019s been nowhere near enough to make Biden the leader of the fundraising pack. In fact, his big-dollar dominance, and his reliance on those donors, is more evidence of how quickly small-dollar donations have become the most important component of political fundraising in a sprawling, fractured Democratic race. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are all outraising Biden, and stockpiling cash significantly faster than him, on the back of major support from online donors that Biden has been unable to build.\n\nIf Biden raised all that money, why does he have a cash-on-hand problem? His burn rate has been spectacular, according to an ABC News report last week. In the third quarter, Biden spent $2 million more than he raised (which was already $6 million less than he raised in the second quarter) for a burn rate of 112%. That\u2019s a very odd development for a campaign that seems intent on limiting its candidate\u2019s public exposure. Whatever the reason, Biden\u2019s in a tough spot; he only has $9 million on hand for the stretch run to the primaries, while top-tier opponents Elizabeth Warren ($25.7 million) and Bernie Sanders ($33.7 million) have lots more resources \u2014 and lots more money coming in.\n\nSo Biden has two big problems \u2014 income and outflow. A super-PAC could solve those problems by allowing outsiders to manage the money and the message, but it doesn\u2019t solve the problems created by the candidate himself. At least one of these major institutional donors told Politico that he may have thrown good money after bad:\n\nThe bundler contributions and connections are helping keep Biden\u2019s campaign afloat, but some of those donors are cringing at the way Biden is running his campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think Joe Biden is going to be the nominee,\u201d said one major fundraiser, who said he gave to Biden out of loyalty during the third quarter. \u201cI think there\u2019s a thirst for something down the road taking us towards something bigger and better. That\u2019s not going to be Joe Biden, for whom I have the utmost respect. He is acting his age and showing his age.\u201d\n\nOn top of all that, the act of forming the super-PAC all but confirms what two previous presidential campaigns have proven about Biden: he\u2019s not a good candidate. Biden has never been good about raising funds and continually sticks his foot in his mouth. The latter quality has been increasingly on display, along with a growing sense that Biden\u2019s time has long since passed. Add to that the obvious desperation to prop him up by the same establishment that tried to rig Hillary Clinton\u2019s nomination four years ago and you have a monumental populist crisis about to hit the Democratic Party.\n\nWe might need a super-PAC just to pay for all the popcorn.", "description": "\"He is acting his age and showing his age.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/biden-bullets.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
