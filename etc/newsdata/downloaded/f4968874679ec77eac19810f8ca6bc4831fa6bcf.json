That\u2019s not the case for Tottenham. But as we saw last year, everything\u2019s possible if you have the belief, the talent and the discipline. Why not be back again?\n\n\u201cObviously, we have a different profile to that type of club \u2014 Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich. It\u2019s not a lack of ambition. When we go on the pitch, it\u2019s to win, whoever is the opponent.\u201d\n\nTottenham have won only two trophies \u2014 the domestic League Cup in 1999 and 2008 \u2014 in the last two decades but Lloris said the squad was steadily improving with top-four finishes in the last four Premier League seasons to qualify for Europe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence. We\u2019re doing something well, we\u2019re building something strong,\u201d Lloris added.\n\n\u201cWe cannot drop the level. We need to build the consistency to improve, to get even closer to what we are all looking for \u2014 trophies.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur may not have the \"profile\" for sustained success in the Champions League like Europe's traditional powerhouse clubs but last season's runnersup make up for it with their belief, goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431081973&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H091", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
