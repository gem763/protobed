She had been undergoing cancer treatment and was suffering from mental health issues, according to the outlet.\n\nAn autopsy determined Ann Marie had been hit in the head more than 30 times and had injuries consistent with those caused by a crowbar, which was found in a pond not far from the scene.\n\nPomphret was charged on April 3 for the homicide, Cheshire Police said. He later copped to the manslaughter of his wife, but rejected the notion that he murdered her.\n\nDefense attorney Richard Pratt told the jury Monday during the trial for Ann Marie\u2019s murder that the couple had been arguing, with the woman calling her husband \u201cuseless.\u201d\n\nAnn Marie then allegedly \u201cturned her attention\u201d to their 18-year-old daughter Megan, calling her a \u201cfat slag\u201d \u2013 \u201cslag\u201d being a term for an overly sexually active woman \u2013 and claiming she was \u201cout to get sex.\u201d\n\n\"This is a case where a quiet man finally snapped,\u201d Pratt told the court. \"You may have little doubt in concluding this was a man who had completely lost his normal character and self-control.\"\n\nBut prosecutor Gordon Cole painted a much different picture, explaining how Pomphret had fed police a \u201ccomplete pack of lies\u201d in the immediate aftermath of Ann Marie\u2019s death.\n\nAt 9:47 that night, he called authorities and claimed he merely found his wife\u2019s lifeless body in the stables near their Cheshire home.\n\n\"My wife came to the stables a couple of hours ago and I\u2019ve have not been able to get her on the phone so I have just come down to the stables and she is lying on the floor in a pool of blood,\u201d he allegedly told the operator, describing her as being \u201cwhite as a sheet.\u201d\n\nWhen the police operator suggested he perform CPR, Pomphret allegedly asked: \u201cAre you joking?\u201d\n\nHe later asked the operator questions, such as \u201cwho would have done this?\u201d and \u201cwho has done this to me wife?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nPomphret also sent several text messages to his wife, asking where she was and expressing concern.\n\nA spokesperson for Barclays UK did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request for comment.\n\nHe is due back in court on Tuesday.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "A British bank executive allegedly battered his sick wife to death with a crowbar when she called him \u201cuseless\u201d and their daughter a derogatory term.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/barclays-ann-marie-pomphret-iStock-Police.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
