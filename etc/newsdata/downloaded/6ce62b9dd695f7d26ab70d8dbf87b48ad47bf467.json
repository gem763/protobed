REUTERS/Khalid al-Mousily\n\nYoung men had erected barricades on a bridge leading to the capital\u2019s fortified Green Zone against security forces who continued to lob tear gas canisters toward them. Medical and security sources said 77 people had been injured.\n\n\u201cWe give you our life and blood, Iraq,\u201d they chanted.\n\nAt least 74 Iraqis were killed on Friday and Saturday and hundreds wounded as demonstrators clashed with security forces and militia groups in a second wave of this month\u2019s protests against Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government. About 231 people have been killed in October.\n\nDespite the OPEC member country\u2019s vast oil wealth, many Iraqis live in poverty or have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic healthcare and education. Iraq is struggling to recover from years of conflict following the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that overthrew dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\nIraqis blame a political elite they say is subservient to one or other of Iraq\u2019s two main allies, the United States and Iran. Many suspect these powers use Iraq as a proxy to pursue their struggle for regional influence, without concern for the needs of ordinary people.\n\n\u201cI ask you Abdul Mahdi, it\u2019s been 16 years and you\u2019ve done nothing. We\u2019re going from bad to worse,\u201d said Ma\u2019azir Yas, who had wrapped herself in an Iraqi flag. \u201cThis protest is peaceful and the young men only ask for their rights: jobs and services.\u201d\n\nProtesters were locked in a cycle on Sunday of advancing deeper into Tahrir Square and towards the Green Zone which houses government buildings, then retreating when the barrage of tear gas canisters became too much.\n\nThe smell of the gas was potent in all corners of the square as security forces fired it indiscriminately and directly at protesters, not into the air.\n\nMany used creative ways to defend themselves including one protester who used a satellite dish as a shield. Tuk-tuks swarmed around, carrying injured young men to ambulances.\n\nYoung men cleaning up the square said they feared a repeat of Saturday night\u2019s crackdown by security forces, when the demonstrations in Tahrir Square were broken up with tear gas and stun grenades. Some protesters have regrouped.\n\nFRAGILE GOVERNMENT\n\nThousands also gathered in the three southern cities of Nassiriya, Hilla, and the Shi\u2019ite holy city of Kerbala.\n\nProtesters set fire to the provincial council building\u2019s entrance in Kerbala and security forces used tear gas to disperse them. Police also used tear gas to disperse protesters in Hilla. Sunday\u2019s protests in Nassiriya were peaceful.\n\nIraq\u2019s elite Counter-Terrorism Service said on Sunday it had deployed in the streets of Baghdad to protect important state buildings \u201cfrom undisciplined elements\u201d.\n\nTwo security sources had told Reuters on Saturday that the Service\u2019s forces in Baghdad had been told to \u201cuse all necessary measures\u201d to end the protests against Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government.\n\nCounter-terrorism forces beat and arrested dozens of protesters in the southern city of Nassiriya on Saturday night.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nThe unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which from 2003 to 2017 endured a foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State insurgency.\n\nIt poses the biggest challenge to Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters\u2019 complaints.\n\nPolitical alliances backing his fragile coalition government have begun to fracture, making his position precarious.", "description": "Thousands of Iraqi protesters stood fast in Baghdad's central Tahrir Square on Sunday, defying a bloody crackdown that killed scores over the weekend and an overnight raid by security forces seeking to disperse them.", "authors": ["Ahmed Aboulenein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445547165&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0LZ", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
