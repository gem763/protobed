Even though the races there started at midnight, 28 of 68 competitors failed to finish the women\u2019s marathon and 18 of 73 men did not finish.\n\n\u201cThis was a decision that was taken quickly,\u201d Coates acknowledged. \u201cIt was a decision that was taken as a consequence of what we saw in Doha.\u201d\n\nTemperatures in Tokyo in July and August when the games will be held regularly exceed 86 degrees, with high humidity adding to the health risks for athletes.\n\nAD\n\nThe IOC had previously moved up the start time for the marathons to 6 a.m. and race walks to 5:30 a.m. but has now decided that isn\u2019t good enough.\n\nNow it wants those races to be shifted 500 miles north to Sapporo, where it says temperatures are forecast to be \u201c5 to 6 degrees Celsius cooler [9 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit] during the day than in Tokyo.\u201d\n\nThe Tokyo government has said it wants to see \u201csufficient scientific evidence\u201d to justify the switch, while members of Koike\u2019s own political party complained on Tuesday that no consideration had been made for the athletes who had prepared for the race in Tokyo or spectators who had already bought tickets. They proposed the race be shifted to 5 a.m.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCity officials are reported to have even suggested a 3 a.m. start, but that would not easily allow for media coverage or helicopters to fly over the course.\n\nCoates had earlier apologized for giving the Tokyo organizing committee \u201ca bit of a surprise\u201d over the decision,\u201d but said it was taken to put \u201cthe health of athletes first,\u201d Kyodo news reported.\n\nHe said he wanted to set up a working group made up of the IOC, the Tokyo government, national government and local Tokyo 2020 organizers to discuss the move.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely recognize and we are so very thankful to the people of Tokyo for all that they have done,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cWe owe it to the people of Tokyo, just as we owe it to the athletes of the world, to make sure they are fully briefed on the reasons.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Koike insisted that Tokyo had spent six years since winning the bid working with the IOC and with experts in medicine and health, and had taken several measures, including \u201csolar heat-blocking pavement, securing shade and studying the hours that the events will be held.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMuch time and money went into these efforts,\u201d she said, pointedly noting that the city had won praise from the IOC itself.\n\nBut the row can also be seen as payback for the way both Tokyo and the IOC blatantly sidestepped concerns about the summer heat when bidding for and awarding these Games to Japan\u2019s capital back in 2013.\n\n\u201cWith many days of mild and sunny weather, this period provides an ideal climate for athletes to perform at their best,\u201d Tokyo claimed at the time of its bid.\n\nAD\n\nThe IOC\u2019s Evaluation Commission even appeared to buy the claims without a murmur, noting in its 2013 report that Tokyo\u2019s dates were selected \u201cfor climatic reasons.\u201d\n\nThe real reason for holding the Games in the summer, experts say, is not the climate but money: It is the most profitable time, to fit in with the demands of U.S. and global television broadcasters.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1964, when Tokyo last held the Olympic Games, they were held in October, but holding the Games in the fall would clash with the NFL, baseball and international soccer.\n\nThere were also concerns about the heat when Atlanta and Athens hosted the Olympics in 1996 and 2004 respectively, while soccer authorities have shifted the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to the winter because of the blistering summer heat there.\n\nAD\n\nPublic opinion in Japan appears to be in favor of shifting the marathon to Sapporo, polls show, although it is much more evenly divided in Tokyo. The host city sees the marathon course as a great way to showcase its charms and tourist attractions.\n\nThe marathons for men and women are set for Aug. 2 and 9, and race-walking events will take place from July 31 through Aug. 8.\n\nAkiko Kashiwagi contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Tokyo refuses to accept IOC order to move marathon to Sapporo due to the summer heat.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pecr9lIFo5Up6b3AMjmRiYvs52w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXEOIVH3CUI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
