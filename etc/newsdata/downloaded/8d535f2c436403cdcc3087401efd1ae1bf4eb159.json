Lindsey Graham, who has been one of President Trump\u2019s strongest allies in the Senate, on Wednesday said Kurdish fighters in Syria had been \u201cshamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration\u201d in its sudden decision to pull U.S. troops from northern Syria, leaving America\u2019s longtime allies in the fight against the Islamic State group exposed to an attack by Turkey.\n\n\u201cI hope he\u2019s right \u2014 I don\u2019t think so. I know that every military person has told him don\u2019t do this,\u201d Graham said in an appearance on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cIf he follows through with this, it\u2019d be the biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d\n\nSmoke rises at the Syrian city of Ras al-Ayn as Turkish troops begin an incursion; Sen.

Scott Applewhite/AP) More\n\nAmid news that Turkish forces had launched a long-threatened military offensive into Kurdish-controlled parts of Syria, Trump on Wednesday continued to stand by his decision to pull out U.S. troops, tweeting Wednesday morning that Turkey should be responsible for guarding all ISIS fighters captured in the area and reiterating, in follow-up tweets, his belief that \u201cgoing into the Middle East is the worst decision ever made in the history of our country!\u201d\n\nGraham, of South Carolina, reacted to Trump\u2019s comments, characterizing them as \u201ca pre-9/11 mentality that the Middle East is no concern to us\u201d that \u201cpaved the way for 9/11.\u201d\n\nFighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East. Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending! https://t.co/Fbcem9i55Z \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nIn an afternoon statement from the White House, Trump confirmed Turkey had invaded Syria Wednesday morning. He declared, \u201cThe United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\n\n\u201cThere are no American soldiers in the area,\u201d Trump added. \u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2014 and we will hold them to this commitment. In addition, Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form. We expect Turkey to abide by all of its commitments, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope President Trump\u2019s right,\u201d Graham told Fox News. \u201cI hope we can turn the fight against ISIS over to Turkey. I hope that Turkey, when they go into Syria, they won\u2019t slaughter the Kurds. And I would say this to the president: It would be hard to protect America without allies over there. ... The Kurds have been good allies. And when Turkey goes into Syria they\u2019re not going to fight ISIS, they\u2019re going in to kill the Kurds, because in their eyes they\u2019re more of a threat to Turkey than ISIS.\u201d\n\nGraham added: \u201cWe can\u2019t abandon the Kurds now. We can\u2019t turn it over to Turkey. To think that would work is really delusional and dangerous.\u201d\n\nGraham, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is one of a number of Trump\u2019s allies who have condemned the decision to withdraw the troops, who had been serving as a buffer between Kurdish fighters and Turkey.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters had fought alongside Americans to defeat the Islamist terror army of ISIS. But their long-held dream of establishing a Kurdish state in territory that overlaps Turkey and Iraq makes them historical enemies of both countries.\n\nThe White House issued a statement Sunday evening saying it \u201cwill not support or be involved in the operation\u201d and \u201cwill no longer be in the immediate area\u201d of northern Syria.\n\nThe move came after months of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s threats of a military operation across the border to clear out the Kurdish forces. The White House said the decision to withdraw troops from Syria came after a call on Sunday between Trump and Erdogan, who views the Kurds as a threat to his ruling party. There are roughly 1,000 U.S. troops currently operating in northeastern Syria.", "description": "Sen.
