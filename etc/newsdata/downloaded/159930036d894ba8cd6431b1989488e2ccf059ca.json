Merriam-Webster, the oldest dictionary publisher in America, officially recognized the usage today, when it added 533 words to its online dictionary.\n\nThe recognition of \u201cthey\u201d as a singular, non-gender-specific pronoun comes as its usage grows in popularity, especially among people who identify as neither male nor female. However, these adoptees frequently face critics who claim the usage is not \u201cgrammatically correct\u201d.\n\nManholes or maintenance holes? The city rejecting gendered language Read more\n\nMerriam-Webster wrote a pre-emptive clapback on its blog. \u201cWe will note that \u2018they\u2019 has been in consistent use as a singular pronoun since the late 1300s; that the development of singular \u2018they\u2019 mirrors the development of the singular \u2018you\u2019 from the plural \u2018you\u2019, yet we don\u2019t complain that singular \u2018you\u2019 is ungrammatical; and that regardless of what detractors say, nearly everyone uses the singular \u2018they\u2019 in casual conversation and often in formal writing.\u201d\n\nEmily Brewster, a senior editor at the company, said: \u201cMerriam-Webster does not try to be at the vanguard of change in the language.\u201d But, she noted: \u201cOver the past few decades, there has been so much evidence that this is a fully established use of \u2018they\u2019 in the English language. This is not new.\u201d\n\nGillian Branstetter, a media relations manager for the National Center for Transgender Equality, sees Merriam-Webster\u2019s decision as fitting into a larger normalization of nonbinary identities. \u201cOverall you\u2019re seeing workplaces, schools and hospitals recognize the current system of only offering \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019 isn\u2019t working for a lot of people,\u201d she says. She points to the inclusion of \u201cthey\u201d in the AP Press Stylebook in 2017 and 14 states offering a third gender option on driver\u2019s licenses.\n\n\u201cThey\u201d has even entered Hollywood. The British singer Sam Smith made headlines last week when they announced on social media that their pronouns were now \u201cthey/them\u201d rather than \u201che/him\u201d. \u201cI understand there will be many mistakes and mis gendering but all I ask is you please please try\u201d, Smith wrote in an emotional series of posts. \u201cI hope you can see me like I see myself now. Thank you.\u201d Smith\u2019s announcement on Twitter has received over 14,000 comments \u2013 a passionate debate over the validity of \u201cthey\u201d taking place in many of them.\n\nBranstetter offers this example for anyone who might be confused: \u201cIf you are at a restaurant and you found a stranger\u2019s phone at a table, you wouldn\u2019t say, I found his or her phone. You would say, \u2018I found their phone.\u2019\u201d\n\nMerriam-Webster is not alone in its recognition. Lexicographers and linguists are coming out widely in support of \u201cthey\u201d as a singular pronoun. The American Dialect Society chose it as its 2015 word of the year.\n\nOther additions to the dictionary include colorful words frequently seen on social media:\n\nDad joke: \u201cA wholesome joke of the type said to be told by fathers with a punchline that is often an obvious or predictable pun or play on words and usually judged to be endearingly corny or unfunny.\u201d\n\nVacay, sesh, inspo: Vacation, session (jamming, drinking or otherwise), inspiration\n\nCoulrophobia: abnormal fear of clowns\n\nBrewster finds the modern evolution of the English language \u2013 accelerated by the internet and social media \u2013 as playful experiment. \u201cIf you think about it, hundreds of years ago what a person who could read had access to \u2013 it wasn\u2019t that much. It was a very filtered written language. The internet has allowed to experience language in its most informal iteration in writing.\u201d", "description": "America\u2019s oldest dictionary claps back at grammar snobs as it embraces more inclusive definition", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Wheeler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72a5fd0fb9e40860e022b306624e51095b38140c/0_131_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a904138663886d022b68c9f991ca871", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
