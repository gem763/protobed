But the new Hustlers trailer is here to remind you that summer is simply a state of mind\u2014especially Hot Girl Summer, which, Hustlers seems to argue, is an aspirational lifestyle, not just a three-month span of time in which we can all truly feel ourselves.\n\nIn case you've missed my unwell rants about Hustlers on basically every form of social media that'll let me talk about it, the movie\u2014out September 13, mark your calendars and start preparing your minds and bodies now\u2014is based on an exceptional New York article by Jessica Pressler about a group of entrepreneurial strippers who turn to a life of light crime to bankroll their extravagant lifestyles. That involves, of course, mildly drugging some Wall Street execs' drinks, running up their credit cards, and celebrating into the wee hours of the night. You love to see it!\n\nThe film adaptation stars\u2014deep breath here\u2014Cardi B, Lizzo, Trace Lysette, Usher, Jennifer Lopez (as Ramona, and honestly, give her an EGOT), Constance Wu, Julia Stiles, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Jon Glaser, and more. The new trailer, the final one before the film's wide release next week, shows us a deeper glimpse of Cardi B's character, Diamond from the Bronx, who's tasked by Lopez to teach Wu's Destiny how to give a \"real dance.\" More than anything, it shows off the movie's willingness to let loose and have fun. Remember when you'd go to the movies and let loose? When the whole cast seemed like they were having the times of their lives filming the thing? When you left feeling light and refreshed and smiling? Yeah, Hustlers seems like it's that kind of movie. That and the fact that the trailer is set to Cardi B's \"Money\" means... you should just start queuing up now.\n\nWatch the final Hustlers trailer below and catch it in theaters on September 13.\n\nLizzo Loves You Like She Loves Herself\n\nYour favorite viral singer/flutist/rapper/twerker is here to change music forever with her power-packed new album, Cuz I Love You.\n\nBest of GQ\n\nCardi B\u2019s Money Moves\n\nThe rapper responsible for last year\u2019s most unexpected hit emerged from a singular New York City story of strip clubs, gangs, and below-board basement butt injections. Navigating new fame and a new record, Invasion of Privacy, Cardi B is fighting to stay true to her Bronx roots while the world clamors for her to become a global superstar.\n\nOriginally Appeared on GQ\n\n", "description": "Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B, Lizzo, and Constance Wu lead an all-star cast in what looks like the year's most fun film.", "authors": ["Brennan Carley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UaBWHU2MIwvuAxqUky5ufQ--~B/aD0xNjU5O3c9MjI5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gq_402/bf11365dd8136e6d7e4f0fa884769b8a"}
