REUTERS/Rodrigo Urzagasti\n\nSANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, Bolivia (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Bolivia\u2019s largest city, turning up heat on President Evo Morales as they voiced outrage over his government\u2019s response to wildfires that have razed broad swaths of the country\u2019s forests this year.\n\nProtesters in the wealthy, industrial city of Santa Cruz brandished placards at the demonstration late on Friday calling for a \u201cpunishment vote\u201d against Morales in the upcoming Oct. 20 presidential election.\n\nTightening polls show Morales, Latin America\u2019s longest-serving leftist leader, may be forced into a second-round runoff with his chief rival, Carlos Mesa, a business-friendly former president.\n\nFor weeks, opposition candidates and protesters have called on Morales to declare this year\u2019s surge in wildfires, which have already scorched an area larger than Costa Rica, a national disaster to help facilitate international aid.\n\nMorales\u2019 government has said a disaster declaration could invite foreign meddling in a sovereign issue, echoing concerns voiced by neighboring Brazil\u2019s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has sparked a global outcry over his handling of fires in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nSanta Cruz, where organizers said as many as 1.5 million people joined in Friday\u2019s protest, is home to vast tracts of Bolivia\u2019s biodiverse Chiquitano dry forests. They are named for the indigenous people who have inhabited them for hundreds of years.\n\nProtesters say a disaster declaration by Bolivia would remove bureaucratic barriers to the help needed from abroad to contain fires in the impoverished South American country.\n\nAuthorities did not give an official estimate of the number of protesters on Friday, but a local reporter working with Reuters said about 350,000 people marched through the city.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Bolivia's largest city, turning up heat on President Evo Morales as they voiced outrage over his government's response to wildfires that have razed broad swaths of the country's forests this year.", "authors": ["Daniel Ramos", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437456175&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940GR", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
