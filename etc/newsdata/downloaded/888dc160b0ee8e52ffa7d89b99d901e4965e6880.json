It advises recipients to report the event as spam, which will remove all events from that organiser from the person\u2019s calendar.\n\nAround 1.5 billion people in 143 countries use Google\u2019s Gmail and Calender apps, which are provided to anyone who signs up for a Google account.\n\nThe fake invite scam was first discovered by security researchers in 2017 but Google is only now addressing the issue.\n\nBlack Hills Information Security published details of the exploit in a detailed blog post two years ago, describing how security controls designed to prevent such attacks could be easily bypassed.\n\nIn researching the bug, the cyber security firm discovered that it was not even necessary to send an email to create an event in someone else\u2019s calendar.\n\nWhen creating an event in Google Calendar, it is possible to select \u201cDon\u2019t Send\u201d when prompted to sent invitations to guests of the event.\n\nThe researchers noted that this was a particularly useful feature for hackers, as users have grown weary of receiving spam and malicious links in emails. Receiving an official notification through Google Calendar is less likely to provoke suspicion, they noted.\n\n\u201cPossibly the most interesting element of the calendar is that it can create a sense of urgency simply by alerting a user to something. Perhaps the user completely \u2018forgot\u2019 they had a meeting scheduled,\u201d the blog states.\n\nLinks within the event or notification will then take victims to a fake Google authentication page that captures their credentials.", "description": "Google has said it is \u201cworking diligently\u201d to fix a major bug that allows hackers to hijack a person\u2019s Google Calendar through unwanted email invites.
