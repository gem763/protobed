Carnell professor and former physics department chair at the Temple University, Philadelpia, provided his personal perspective Saturday as a victim of racial profiling.\n\nIn May 2015, the US Department of Justice arrested him on charges of \"having sent restricted technology to China\", which later turned out to be normal collaboration.\n\nAlthough he was cleared in September, with all charges against him dropped, the US government has not compensated Xi in any form, and the nightmare of a dozen armed FBI agents rushing into his home, taking him away in front of his wife and daughters, and facing a possible 80 years of imprisonment and a $1 million fine, is still lingering.\n\nChen, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service in Ohio, was falsely accused of spying in 2014.\n\nSusan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at UC San Diego and former US deputy assistant secretary of state, said China and the US wove together a dense fabric of trade, technology, and education \u2013 forming a nexus of what became globalization. \"To preserve America's open society and vibrant research environment, we should double down on American openness, not put limitations on scientific collaboration,\" she emphasized.\n\nEchoing Shirk, Ho said science depends on open and free exchange.\n\n\"Science has no borders. Science by definition is global. The real threat is not from occasional cases of espionage; the real threat is not believing in science, and the creation of a toxic environment that drives away talented Chinese and Chinese American scientists,\" Ho said.\n\nThomas Rosenbaum, president of the California Institute of Technology, said the strength of the United States as a scientific, technological and economic power has been significantly helped by immigration.\n\n\"Recent demonstrated examples of violations of scientific ethics, coupled with fears for US economic competitiveness and national security, may well lead to governmental restrictions that broadly and severely restrict the flow of people and ideas,\" he warned.\n\nJohn Hennessy, chairman of Alphabet Inc, Google's parent company, and president emeritus of Stanford University, said immigrants make America better. \"There are a number of important American companies with foreign-born founders. If you cut that off, you cut off an important part of our nation's economic vitality,\" he said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/02/5d937d1ba310cf3e979f7fee.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
