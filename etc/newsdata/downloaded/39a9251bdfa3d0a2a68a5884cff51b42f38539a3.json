(Photo by FAYEZ NURELDINE/AFP/Getty Images) Donald Trump risks a political backlash if he retaliates against Iran over a weekend strike on Saudi Arabian oil facilities after campaigning on promises to withdraw the U.S. from foreign wars.\n\nTrump tweeted Sunday that the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d raising bipartisan alarm after the weekend attack that halved Saudi oil production. Speaking on Monday to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly looking that way at this moment,\u201d and \u201cwe pretty much already know\u201d who did it.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran, though Riyadh is stopping short of directly doing so.\n\nIran has denied involvement. and it\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Tuesday that the Islamic Republic won\u2019t negotiate with the U.S. on any level, including at this month\u2019s annual United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nTrump, who hasn\u2019t ruled out a possible meeting with Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani when both are in New York this month, has said diplomacy with Iran isn\u2019t exhausted and that Pompeo will be heading to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe prospect of a strike on Iran in retaliation for an attack that didn\u2019t target Americans or even a country with which the U.S. has a defense treaty is proving divisive in Washington. Trump said the U.S. is prepared for any conflict, but that Saudi Arabia would need to play a significant part in any action.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s popularity is at a nadir over the prolonged war it has fought in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom\u2019s Istanbul consulate earlier this year. Congress voted in April to cut off military support for Saudi Arabia over the Yemen war, legislation Trump vetoed.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said on Monday that Trump should consider attacking Iranian oil refineries, but Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, said direct U.S. intervention would be \u201ca grave mistake.\u201d\n\nBefore he was president, Trump expressed skepticism of U.S. military action on behalf of Saudi Arabia. \u201cSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won\u2019t, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth-$ trillion!\u201d he said in a 2014 tweet. But his tweet on Sunday indicated that he\u2019s waiting for the kingdom to tell the U.S. what it wants to do.\n\nTrump adopted the slogan \u201cAmerica First\u201d during the 2016 campaign, and vowed to withdraw from foreign wars.\n\nRead How Saudi Wealth and Weaponry Still Can\u2019t Guarantee Oil\u2019s Protection\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday that defense officials had briefed Trump about the situation on Monday, and that Esper spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Iraqi Defense Minister Najah al-Shammari over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe United States military, with our interagency team, is working with our partners to address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran,\u201d Esper tweeted.\n\nMarc Short, the chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, earlier downplayed the prospect of U.S. military action.\n\n\u201cI think \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 means several things. One thing that it means is that America today under this president is far better prepared to handle these sort of events because we\u2019re now a net exporter of oil,\u201d Short said in an interview on Fox Business Network. \u201cWe know that Iran has been trying to instigate attacks against Saudi Arabia for some time.\u201d\n\nSenators\u2019 views\n\nChris Coons, a Democrat and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Monday morning that military action against Iran may be warranted, depending on information gathered by U.S. intelligence services.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that the president will consult with his generals, his diplomats, his advisers, will look hard at the intelligence,\u201d Coons said in an interview on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d a show the president often watches. \u201cIran is one of the most dangerous state sponsors of terrorism. This may well be the thing that calls for military action against Iran if that\u2019s what the intelligence supports.\u201d\n\nRelated video: Sen. Coons talks Iran, new Kavanaugh allegations, gun legislation (FOX News)\n\nBut Coons faced criticism from liberals for his remarks, and a Democratic colleague, Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz, said on Twitter: \u201cThere is no imminent threat and the U.S. military is not authorized to retaliate on behalf of another country.\u201d\n\nMost of the vetoes Trump has issued during his presidency were of bipartisan resolutions regarding Saudi Arabia, and every time Congress has failed to muster enough votes to override his veto.\n\nTrump vetoes\n\nOne of the measures sought to end U.S. assistance for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war against Houthi rebels in Yemen, citing the humanitarian disaster caused by the conflict. Trump also vetoed three resolutions to curb U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe rift between Trump and some Republicans began after the murder of Khashoggi, a U.S.-based columnist for the Washington Post. The Senate is still considering punishment for Saudi officials alleged to be involved in the killing, including a bipartisan measure to suspend arms sales to the kingdom and impose sanctions on those found responsible for the Khashoggi murder, potentially including Prince Mohammad.\n\nJames Carafano, a foreign policy analyst at the Heritage Institute, a conservative research group, said Iran needs to be held accountable for its behavior, but that the U.S. would be better off supporting a Saudi Arabian response, rather than launching its own.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis need to have some backbone. This was not an attack on the U.S. forces or U.S. bases, this was an attack on Saudi Arabia,\u201d Carafano said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to conduct a retaliatory strike, you have to make the case to the world that this is warranted and appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance from Alyza Sebenius.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Donald Trump risks a political backlash if he retaliates against Iran over a weekend strike on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHo8Gr.img?h=126&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1281&y=1540"}
