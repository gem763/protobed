The DUP cited issues with how trade taxes and customs would be handled in a post-Brexit world.\n\n\"As things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on [value added tax],\" said the party's leader, Arlene Foster and deputy leader, Nigel Dodds in a statement.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, meanwhile, said Johnson\u2019s deal was \u201cgood for Ireland and Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nJohnson has touted the fact that his new deal kills the \u201canti-democratic backstop,\u201d which effectively prevented a \u201chard border\u201d between Northern Ireland and Ireland, an EU member state. The hard border would have kept the UK tied to the EU\u2019s customs union until a trade deal could be worked out, and Brexiteers worried that could give the EU power over the U.K.\u2019s trade policy.\n\nEU member states will have to approve the deal at a summit on Thursday and Friday. Then Parliament will sit on a Saturday, for the first time since the outbreak of the Falklands War, to consider the deal.\n\nWithout DUP\u2019s support, Johnson would likely have to convince a number of Labour MPs and Conservatives who rebelled against him during his first vote as prime minister.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn panned the \u201csell-out deal\u201d and called on MPs to reject it.\n\n\u201cFrom what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis sell-out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u201d\n\nThe BBC reported Johnson will ask EU leaders to reject requests for an extension to the October 31 Brexit deadline. Parliament passed a law last month that requires the PM to ask for an extension, unless a deal has been approved or a no-deal Brexit has been given the go-ahead by October 19.\n\n\n\nCover: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures as he participates in an art class at St Mary's and All Saints Primary School in Beaconsfield, England, Friday, Oct. 11, 2019.
