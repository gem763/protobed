Any team can be beaten on any day and we just have to try to make sure we do that at Anfield. As a striker, it\u2019s not just one-v-one on the pitch, there\u2019s a lot that goes into it. Van Dijk is an amazing defender and he has had a fantastic couple of years at Liverpool.\n\n\u201cSo, from my point of view, it\u2019s just about playing my game and making my movements, making my runs and trying to get on the scoresheet, trying to get assists.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a team game, so we all have to be on it with each other and that\u2019s the main aim. You want to win, you want to come out on top and they came out on top in May, or June, whenever it was. I\u2019ve tried to forget it.\u201d\n\nManager Mauricio Pochettino acknowledges that his side face a testing 90 minutes against the last unbeaten side in the league, but says he\u2019s fully motivated to ensure his team performs on the big stage.\n\n\u201cOf course, it is going to be difficult. Liverpool are having a fantastic season, last season they were very close in the Premier League with Man City, they won the Champions League final against us and I think they\u2019re doing a fantastic job.\n\n\u201cJurgen Klopp is a fantastic guy, I admire him and we have a great relationship. It is great to meet him and play against a team like Liverpool that have unbelievable players.\n\n\u201cFor me, it is a joy to go there and the motivation is there is there to play in a stadium like Anfield - it always is amazing. When you have the opportunity to play this kind of game, you are thankful because you never know if you are going to have the opportunity to play it again.\u201d", "description": "Harry Kane says Liverpool\u00a0can be beaten at Anfield\u00a0and wants his Tottenham\u00a0team to continue a recent return to form by taking the points in the Premier League on Sunday.", "authors": ["Karl Matchett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/21/Harry-Kane.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
