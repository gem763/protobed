This is where village tapas bars still serve free morsels with your ca\u00f1a (beer), fountains gush with spring water and, during the autumn olive harvest, a frenzy of activity takes over from the deep summer slumber.", "description": "", "authors": ["Fiona Dunlop"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/andalucia-village-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
