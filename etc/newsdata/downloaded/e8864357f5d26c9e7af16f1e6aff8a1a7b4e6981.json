Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has been attempting to convince international firms to manufacture their products in India by promising a more predictable and open regulatory regime and simpler corporate tax structure.\n\nThe country has ramped up these efforts as it deals with an economic slowdown. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated in an interview with the Wall Street Journal: \u201cIndia will be more attractive, particularly in the light of what is developing between the U.S. and China.\u201d Sitharaman has cut corporate tax rates to as low as 15 percent in efforts to have more firms invest in the country.\n\nThe country has focused on attracting cell phone manufacturers, with India\u2019s Minister of Electronics and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad meeting with leaders of more than 50 phone and electronics companies in September to discuss what they would need to invest in India. \u201cApple is looking for alternative countries to shift some of its manufacturing out of China amid the trade war with the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are one of the big countries which can provide an alternative.\u201d\n\nSo far India\u2019s efforts appear to be working, Samsung is building one of its biggest facilities in the world near New Delhi and the first India-produced iPhone XR\u2019s were recently released.\n\nIt's here. One of the world's most sophisticated smartphones, now made in India as @PMOIndia looks for ways to bring big brands and jobs from China. https://t.co/QP491qdYhr pic.twitter.com/By1b2z7WBz \u2014 Eric Bellman (@EricBellmanWSJ) October 21, 2019\n\nThe iPhone XR is reportedly being produced in India by the Chinese company Foxconn Technology Group for the local market according to phone retailers. Young-Way Liu, the head of Foxconn\u2019s semiconductor business group stated: \u201cWith this global footprint of our production, I think we are one of the most capable ones to face the challenge when the trade war goes sour.\u201d Foxconn\u2019s operations in India have increased from a few hundred employees in Southern India to more than 30,000 in the past three years alone.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
