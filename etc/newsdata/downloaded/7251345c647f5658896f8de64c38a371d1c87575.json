Hulu and MGM are in talks with showrunner Bruce Miller about how to best adapt \"The Testaments,\" according to Time.\n\n\"We've tried to hint at the wider world as much as possible in the show,\" Miller told Time. \"'The Testaments' really gives us much wider glimpses into other parts of the world.\"\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\" won the Emmy for outstanding drama series in 2017 for its first season. Reviews have been positive for its three seasons, but Rotten Tomatoes critic scores have dropped slightly from season to season. The first season received a 94% critic score, and the third season, which debuted in June, has an 82%.\n\nVariety said \"the show is stuck in a repetitive loop\" during the third season.\n\nAtwood's \"The Testaments\" has received praise ahead of its release. Entertainment Weekly called it an \"essential, moving thriller.\" NPR called it \"fast and even thrilling.\" It has also been shortlisted for the esteemed literature award, the Booker prize.", "description": "Margaret Atwood's \"The Testaments,\" a sequel to her novel, \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" will be released September 10.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6fc7782e22af5b8f777f5b-1334-667.jpg"}
