All you have to do is read the transcript.\u201d\n\nTrump brushed off reports that, according to a memo the whistleblower wrote one day after the call, a White House official described the Trump-Zelensky call as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfrightening\u201d and that aides quickly became concerned about containing the fallout from the call, again referring to the growing scandal as a \u201ccon being perpetrated on the United States public.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why a person that defrauds the American public should be protected, OK?\u201d\n\nThe president has sought to undermine the whistleblower on a daily basis in the weeks since news of the complaint broke. He\u2019s been aided by allies, conservative media outlets and internet sleuths who have seized on the intelligence community inspector general\u2019s acknowledgment that the complainant exhibited \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias \u2026 in favor of a rival political candidate,\u201d though the complaint was deemed credible regardless.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/2185/1155968404_6093549104001_6093546356001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nOver the last 24 hours, several media outlets reported that in congressional testimony, the intelligence community watchdog told lawmakers the whistleblower had \u201csome type of professional relationship\u201d with a Democrat running for president.\n\nBut lawyers for the whistleblower tried to shut down the criticism in a statement released Wednesday evening. They denied that their client ever \u201cworked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party,\u201d adding that the whistleblower had served their entire government career in apolitical roles, encountering politicians from both parties in those roles.\n\nThey also noted that the whistleblower provided relevant career information to the inspector general for the purpose of allowing the watchdog to accurately assess the credibility of the complaint, and again pointed out that the complaint was ultimately deemed credible.\n\nFinally, they said, \u201cthe whistleblower is not the story. To date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources. For that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s litany of attacks have prompted concerns for the whistleblower\u2019s safety, and experts say there is probably no statute blocking Trump from disclosing his or her identity to the public. In a letter to the acting director of national intelligence last month, the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys raised worries about their client\u2019s safety.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/22/40/d2387d4245cb86512b9d7de2ce1d/20191009-trump-whistleblower-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
