But with all the problems that are going on there, I just don\u2019t see how we\u2019d be able to really make as much difference as we\u2019d want to without the issues and the judgment of how we would be with those surroundings.\u201d\n\nThe royal father of one added, \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard place to live when you know what\u2019s going on.
