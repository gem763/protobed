The bison was wearing a doctor\u2019s coat and a stethoscope. The bison was handing them colorful prescription bottles.\n\n\u201cUm, they are giving the kids medication?\u201d interrupted troop mom Alison Wheeler. She grabbed a bottle and realized it was empty. Its label read, \u201cRx: Time in nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018prescription\u2019 to go outdoors,\u2019 \u201d said a volunteer, explaining the gimmick that summed up why 175 people gathered in the woods Saturday morning.\n\nAfter a week of frenzied impeachment drama in Washington, its residents sorely needed an escape. They found one in National Public Lands Day, a 26-year-old tradition that brings volunteers out to care for beloved green spaces across the country.\n\n\u201cWe need nature therapy on a regular basis,\u201d said Sarah Fuhrman, a USAID employee who came to pick up trash and breath in the fresh air.\n\nWhile she bagged discarded bottles and windswept wrappers, an estimated 150,000 people were working on similar projects at more than 1,000 sites across the country, according to the National Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF), which organized the day. In the Washington region, volunteers geotagged plants on Kingman Island and cleaned ponds at Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens. All the while, people were cleaning graffiti at Yellowstone National Park, building a new trail at the Grand Canyon and cleaning up the beaches of Cape Cod.\n\n\u201cWe constantly hear from parks that the amount of work that gets done on this day would take their staff months to complete,\u201d said Tony Richardson, NEEF\u2019s engagement director. Founded by Congress in 1990 to work in tandem with the Environmental Protection Agency, NEEF is required to remain nonpartisan.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want National Public Lands Day to be tied to any sort of political agenda,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cWe want it to remain this thing that people from all political ideologies, all walks of life go to . . . Because everyone owns public lands.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohn Robert Deoudes of Bethesda, 12, left, and Leslie Marasco of Arlington rebuild native bee hotels after the bamboo was cleaned at Rock Creek Park in honor of National Public Lands Day. (Cheryl Diaz Meyer for The Washington Post)\n\nBut at a time when those lands frequently become embroiled in political showdowns \u2014 at the U.S.-Mexico border, during the government shutdown and in the debate over climate change \u2014 even a day of volunteering in a national park felt like a political statement for some volunteers.\n\n[Climate change is destroying our national parks at an alarming rate, study finds]\n\n\u201cThe news is so bad,\u201d said Steve Baragona, a reporter for Voice of America who helped plant trees Saturday. \u201cI want to do some little good thing, some small thing I can actually get my hands around.\u201d\n\nIn another part of the woods, 17-year-old Emily Newman had her hands around the root of a Bush honeysuckle, one of the invasive shrubs that have been crowding out native plants in the park. She bent her knees and heaved until the bush was free from the dirt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so satisfying to get them out of the ground,\u201d she said, reaching for another. For Newman, a senior at Washington-Liberty High School in Arlington, the woods were an escape not from politics but from the tiresome process of college applications and never-ending sagas of high school drama. She tried to get her friends to join her for volunteering, but they were all too busy; homecoming was later that night. She planned to trade her hiking pants for a red silk dress in a few hours.\n\nBut first, there were more shrubs to take down. Nearby, the Girl Scouts had traded their prescription bottles for gloves and trash bags. The troop, a group of Bethesda third-graders, were yanking weeds near a path.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not toss them at each other,\u201d Wheeler pleaded.\n\n\u201cI have dirt in my shoe!\u201d a girl cried.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone have a tissue?\u201d another asked.\n\nThe girls moved slowly, their little hands pulling one weed at a time \u2014 not as an escape or to make a statement, but because they had come to help.", "description": "After a wild week in Washington, more than 100 people turn out to volunteer in Rock Creek Park.", "authors": ["Jessica Contrera", "Enterprise Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RkjdjSLh3_tCYcySWrmOIzH1T74=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EYBIOAHCDEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
