Here\u2019s how to fix it", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to TNW Basics, a collection of tips, guides, and advice on how to easily get the most out of your gadgets, apps, and other stuff.\n\nThe Pixel 4\u2018s 90Hz display is supposed to be one of the best things about the phone. Once reserved to gaming phones and VR applications, high refresh rates can lead to a much smoother-feeling phone that makes it hard to go back to the comparatively choppy 60 Hz panel on just about every other phone.\n\nThat\u2019s why it was so annoying when, a few days into my review process, I noticed the Pixel 4 hardly stuck to that frame rate. Many others have too; redditors over at r/GooglePixel noticed out Google reduces the refresh rate back to 60Hz whenever the display brightness drops below 75 percent for some reason. However, sometimes it will maintain the refresh rate if the ambient lighting is bright enough.\n\nHoly crap. Google Pixel 4 changes between 60Hz and 90Hz based on screen brightness.https://t.co/J6J2SjNBEw I tested using ADB and logcat. If brightness < 75%, display id = 2.\n\nIf brightness >= 75%, display id = 1. \u2014 Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) October 23, 2019\n\nWeird.\n\nThe 90Hz feature is supposed to be \u2018smart,\u2019 changing depending on what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t need a 90Hz refresh rate when watching a 30fps YouTube video, for example. But I expected the Pixel 4 to be more like the OnePlus 7T or some gaming phones with high refresh rate panels. Although these devices can also adjust framerate depending on the content, they seem to run at 90 Hz nearly all the time.\n\nIf, like me, you\u2019re sensitive to frame rate, this is likely worse than if the display just stuck to 60Hz. You adapt to your screen\u2019s framerate, so it\u2019s the constant changing that gets annoying.\n\nThankfully, Google has updates on the way that are supposed to improve the refresh rate algorithm, as reported by The Verge. Though it seems the refresh rate will still adjust automatically, Google told The Verge the updates will enable 90 Hz \u201cin more brightness conditions.\u201d\n\nBut if you don\u2019t want to be at the mercy of Google\u2018s decisions, there\u2019s another solution. As spotted by MKBHD, there\u2019s a new option in the Pixel 4\u2019s Developer Options menu that allows you to keep 90 Hz on all the time. If you don\u2019t know how to access the hidden menu, you can check out our short guide here.\n\nOnce in the Developer options, simply scroll down to the \u2018Debugging\u2019 section and look for the option that reads \u2018force 90 Hz refresh rate.\u2019\n\nAnd there you go! Now you have a silky-smooth refresh rate 100 percent of the time. I presume this will affect battery life \u2013 a bit of a concern, considering the Pixels have smallish batteries by 2019 standards \u2013 but so far I haven\u2019t seen too bad of a hit on my own review unit. Hopefully, Google\u2018s update will strike a more tasteful balance of battery life and smoothness.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FGoogle-Pixel-4-5-of-7.jpg&signature=3b16008550f3ad6f35ede2bb27205cc8", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
