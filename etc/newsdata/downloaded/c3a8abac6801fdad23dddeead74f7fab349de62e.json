The palette engrains the grit and determination of Brooklyn into our playing surface. pic.twitter.com/S5tRw5TOzP \u2014 Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) September 23, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe gray floor is a nod to the blacktop court streets of Brooklyn and its \u201cindustrial vibe.\u201d The league approved the idea, per Lowe, and the Nets organization worked on getting the color gray just right to come across well on broadcasts. It\u2019s a gray stain on the herringbone designed wood court, which is similar to the floor pattern in many Brooklyn brownstone homes.\n\nInspired by the borough. Built for the borough.\n\n\n\nIntroducing our first fully redesigned court of the Brooklyn era \ud83c\udfa5 pic.twitter.com/NKilJhu9u0 \u2014 Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) September 23, 2019\n\nThe Helvetica font \u201cBrooklyn Nets\u201d matches what the Metropolitan Transportation Authority uses on subway signs. The Nets also brought back the mosaic-style lettering in the baseline wordmarks that it scrapped last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nJeff Gamble, the team's vice president of content and creative, told ESPN:\n\n\"The subway design really resonated. We got a couple of eyebrow raises [over moving away from it]. We nodded along at that. We felt like we had made a change for the sake of change. We could have handled it better.\"\n\nThe team originally wanted black lettering on white baselines with black tiles, but switched it to white lettering on black with white tiles around the sidelines after getting feedback from the league, per ESPN. They also went with a simple \u201cB\u201d logo at halfcourt rather than the full Nets logo.\n\nThe baselines proudly display \u201cBrooklyn Nets\u201d in typeface inspired by subway signage, with a subway tile pattern running across the apron perimeter. pic.twitter.com/4OnFm1IbwP \u2014 Brooklyn Nets (@BrooklynNets) September 23, 2019\n\nThe court is only the latest aspect of the Nets to get a do-over. The team added Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan in free agency and Joseph Tsai took over full ownership of the team this summer.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "They're the new-look Nets in more ways than one.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KXSdEWgAHvdQwMI.IMcKew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTQuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q1cVHwGiyezLP88dyqmLfw--~B/aD0yMDY5O3c9MzEwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4cbbbd90-de21-11e9-b1fd-941b6fa524ec", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
