I was really taken aback when I saw that today there was a blockade.\u201d\n\nSantaco\u2019s Mzoxolo Didela said that the drivers themselves had organised today\u2019s protests and the council was not involved.\n\n\u201cWe are sending the taxi owners to speak to the drivers so that we can tell them that this is not the way to deal with the concerns. They can\u2019t block the road and leave Cape Town at ransom.\u201d\n\nHe said the council would take the ongoing frustrations to the MEC on Monday.\n\nThe City of Cape Town said that 20 taxis had been impounded following the blockades.\n\nTransport mayco member Felicity Purchase said the city was constantly in discussion with taxi associations regarding routes, permits and other logistical matters.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in the last week, we\u2019ve had numerous discussions with various taxi associations. What we\u2019ll not do is discuss issues around not enforcing the law. We will not negotiate with criminals. What they\u2019re doing today is criminal. We negotiate on the basis of what their mandate and our mandate is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post We Will Not Negotiate With Criminals \u2013 CoCT\u2019s Purchase appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "We Will Not Negotiate With Criminals \u2013 CoCT\u2019s Purchase", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/international_newspapers_69x52._800x533_L_1419494241.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
