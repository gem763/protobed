The Belgium international did his homework on his new club on the Sampdoria team bus and when he turned up at Leicester to sign a week or so later it was without the tools of his trade.\n\n\u201cIt was a really close call because it was deadline day,\u201d Praet says. \u201cI arrived at the training ground but there were some small issues with the contract and I think it was only one hour before the deadline that everything was figured out, so I signed just in time. But I arrived here with the thought that if I sign, I could go back to get my stuff I needed. But the gaffer really wanted me to stay for the first game. I had no boots, so I did two training sessions and the first game with somebody else\u2019s. I don\u2019t even know whose they were.\u201d\n\nPremier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more\n\nPraet smiles as he looks back on that rather chaotic start. At one stage Brendan Rodgers, Leicester\u2019s manager, thought Praet was ignoring him. \u201cHe sent me a text message the day before I came but it was on my Belgium number that I didn\u2019t have with me, so I saw it three days after I signed,\u201d says Praet, shaking his head. \u201cHe thought I didn\u2019t reply to him. He said: \u2018I sent you messages!\u2019\u201d\n\nOther lines of communication were already open at Leicester. Youri Tielemans, who had joined from Monaco earlier in the summer, was a former teammate at Anderlecht as well as being part of the Belgium squad, and Praet was soon on the phone to his countryman once he had satisfied himself that Leicester\u2019s style of play complemented his own.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the interest from Leicester in me, it was important for me to see how they played because I didn\u2019t know exactly. At that moment I was on the coach with Sampdoria, we were driving to a friendly game and I watched the second half of Leicester v Atalanta,\u201d says Praet, smiling at the thought.\n\n\u201cI know Atalanta from Italy \u2013 they\u2019re a really good team. But I was really surprised by the way Leicester were playing \u2013 with a really high press, really nice football, a lot of chances. At that moment I was sold. Of course after that, when it was really getting serious, I spoke with Youri about: \u2018How is the gaffer? How is the training centre? How are the players?\u2019 And he was so positive.\u201d\n\nAlthough the intensity of the Premier League has taken Praet a little by surprise \u2013 his debut at Chelsea was more like a basketball match when he came off the bench \u2013 he has no doubt he has made the right move and also believes Leicester can achieve something special this season. \u201cWe must be a team that tries to get into that top six,\u201d he says before Saturday\u2019s fixture at Tottenham, \u201cand I think we have the players to do it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dennis Praet went to school 70km from home to be part of Genk\u2019s academy.

He was shown around Arsenal\u2019s training ground as a 15-year-old by Liam Brady, when Praet was coming off the same conveyer belt in Genk that produced Kevin De Bruyne, Divock Origi and Thibaut Courtois.\n\n\u201cI had three or four really good options,\u201d Praet says. \u201cWe went to visit Arsenal, Lille, Ajax and Anderlecht. Arsenal would have been a really nice step and I could earn a lot more money there than in Anderlecht, but at that moment my education was not finished and that was really important for me \u2013 there was no insurance that I would become a good football player.\u201d\n\nPraet gave himself every chance of succeeding, though. As a child, he would be picked up from his home in Leuven just after 7am, attend a secondary school in Genk, which was 70km away, and then train with the club\u2019s academy across the afternoon and evening. \u201cI would came back to Leuven at 10pm,\u201d Praet says. \u201cThey were 14/15-hour days. But I never thought: \u2018This is heavy.\u2019 It was my goal to become a football player. Of course, in Genk they always said: \u2018Come to this guest family, it\u2019s much easier.\u2019 But I\u2019m also a family man and I like being at home.\u201d\n\nGenk\u2019s loss was always going to be Anderlecht\u2019s gain. Praet broke into the first-team as a 17-year-old and racked up more than 100 appearances by the time he made his Belgium debut at the age of 20. Scoring and creating goals freely, he was named Belgium\u2019s player of the year in 2014 and it was inevitable he would move on sooner or later.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dennis Praet was in Genoa when the Morandi Bridge collapsed. \u2018I was just watching it with a dry throat,\u2019 he says. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\nIn the end he joined Sampdoria and it is clear that the club, the city of Genoa and Italian football in general left a big impression on him during his three years there. Praet talks about being \u201ca more complete player than I was before\u201d and explains how he has evolved from a No 10 into \u201ca modern No 8 that can be creative in attack but also do the dirty work in defensive ways\u201d.\n\nIt was, Praet says, a totally different way of training as well as playing. \u201cIn Italy, the tactics is what it\u2019s all about. To give an example \u2013 and I really thought this was funny \u2013 we came into the TV room to watch videos almost every day, and when we played in training against the under-20 team [as preparation for an upcoming match], they also had to come into the video room to show them how the opposition team was pressing; that\u2019s how far it goes. They were in there for half an hour: \u2018This guy presses like this, now this guy presses like this\u2019, and then they did it on the training ground too.\u201d\n\nWhile Praet, 25, has many happy memories from his spell with Sampdoria, his time in Genoa was marked by tragedy too. On 14 August last year, a 200-metre section of the landmark Morandi Bridge collapsed, killing 43 people. Praet and his Sampdoria teammates, together with the Genoa players, attended a state funeral for the victims as the city\u2019s football teams united.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cIt was a really, really sad day,\u201d Praet says. \u201cI remember our team manager saying in the WhatsApp Group for the team: \u2018The Morandi Bridge collapsed. Is everybody OK?\u2019 I was thinking: \u2018Hell, what is he saying?\u2019 Then I put on the TV \u2013 I was at home at the time \u2013 and then you see all those images. I was just watching it with a dry throat. It was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nIt is another reason why Sampdoria and the city of Genoa will always have a \u201cspecial place\u201d in Praet\u2019s heart. Returning to say farewell to his former teammates after signing for Leicester was something that Praet, who comes across as such a likable character, simply had to do. And, of course, he needed to pick up those boots.", "description": "The midfielder talks to Stuart James about rejecting Arsenal as a teenager and how he chose to join Leicester after watching them on Sampdoria\u2019s team bus", "authors": ["Stuart James"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cf8d938083a8830c4cfd2f29f2cccd38d74e81d/401_733_5002_3001/master/5002.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ba671f586241502a9357bac3b76c58a", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
