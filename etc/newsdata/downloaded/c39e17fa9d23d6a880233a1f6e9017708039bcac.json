I love you so much.'\n\nIt was that moment that reduced Jackie to tears.\n\nIn the footage from the KIIS FM studio, the 44-year-old could be seen weeping and wiping away her tears with a tissue.\n\n'She doesn't know how much she's done for me,' added Schapelle, before turning to her sister Mercedes and saying, 'I love you so much.' Then the floodgates opened.\n\n'I think your sister was prepared to sleep with you in jail to support you,' said Jackie.\n\nDuring her radio interview to promote her updated memoir, My Story, Schapelle also addressed rumours she will appear on a reality show next year.\n\n'Never say never!' she said when asked if she would ever consider going on The Bachelorette or Big Brother.\n\nEmotional bond: 'I think your sister was prepared to sleep with you in jail to support,' said Jackie, fighting back the tears\n\nRadio host Kyle Sandilands then suggested she could do I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, but Schapelle replied: 'I'm vegetarian, I can't eat spiders.'\n\nJackie, who is a judge on The Masked Singer, then offered: 'Can you sing? Would you ever go on The Masked Singer?'\n\n'When I was on parole, I used to watch the Korean [version of] The Masked Singer... I loved that show!' Schapelle responded.", "description": "She's the cashed up radio Titan who has literally seen and heard it all during her 15-year broadcast career.", "authors": ["Shannon Shipley For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/02/20357048-0-image-a-72_1572401758785.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
