A 2-0 victory in the Bulgarian capital, though, hinted at what was to come.\n\n\u201cIt was a rough period for us (under Gullit),\u201d says Dabizas. \u201cA lot of us were not part of the plans under him. The future was not bright for us or for the club.\n\n\u201cWhen Bobby came, everyone started from scratch, from zero. Straight away you could sense a change in the atmosphere, not just in the dressing room but in the town in general.\n\n\u201cWe had a new lease of life. The game in Bulgaria was a big one for us. That first win gave everyone a huge lift. A lot of the boys who hadn\u2019t been playing came back in for that game. It was a new start. After that, the general feeling was completely different.\u201d\n\nIf a win in Sofia had given the players and the locals renewed hope, then what followed didn\u2019t just raise expectation levels as send them into a different stratosphere.\n\n\u201cI think we had something like one point from our first seven matches,\u201d says Warren Barton, who was signed for Newcastle by Kevin Keegan in the summer of 1995.\n\n\u201cWe were shipping goals. We had no confidence and to be honest not a lot of hope. Then Sheffield Wednesday came to St James\u2019 Park and everything changed.\u201d\n\nThe match report in The Independent the following day pretty much summed up the mood, after a rampant Newcastle took flight at the expense of a hapless Owls\u2019 side.\n\n\u201cIt was Bobby Robson\u2019s, Alan Shearer\u2019s and Newcastle United\u2019s day,\u201d the report read.\n\nThe records tumbled. Shearer scored five \u2013 in an 8-0 demolition job that saw Wednesday replace Newcastle at the bottom of the table \u2013 the biggest match haul in his career. Robson, meanwhile, celebrated his biggest win in club management, while Newcastle enjoyed their biggest win since 1946. Robson had promised Shearer he would buy him a Mars Bar if he had scored six.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to get my own now,\u201d said Shearer after missing out.\n\nConfectionery promises aside, it was a sweet win in every sense. A first three points in the Premier League since April meant that instead of looking fearfully down, English football\u2019s great entertainers were looking skywards once more.\n\n\u201cI was in the stands that day because I was suspended but the atmosphere in the ground was incredible,\u201d says Dabizas. \u201cThe hairs on the back of my neck stand up even now when I talk about it.\n\n\u201cSometimes you can sense things from day one. Appointing him was the best decision Newcastle ever made, alongside bringing in Kevin Keegan.\n\n\u201cSometimes career achievements speak volumes about the personality of the coach. If you look at Bobby\u2019s CV he had success everywhere. He was an English guy but he was so flexible, so clever and so charismatic that he adapted wherever he went \u2013 Portugal, Spain, Holland, it didn\u2019t matter where he was.\n\n\u201cHe had so much success in different countries and also with the national team. He was so genuine and so capable of transforming places. That\u2019s what he did at Newcastle. He didn\u2019t spend huge amounts of money but within a couple of years we were challenging for the title again.\u201d\n\nAll of which contrasts sharply with the gloom that currently surrounds the club, although four points from their last two matches has lightened the mood to a certain extent.\n\nBarton, who now lives in America and works for Fox Soccer, was on the terraces alongside the Newcastle fans at Carrow Road back in August as the club sank to a 3-1 defeat against the newly promoted Canaries.\n\nThe experience couldn\u2019t have been further removed from the one at St James\u2019 Park against Wednesday all those years ago.\n\n\u201cThese fans have been through a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re getting punched in the stomach every week. There was nothing to get them off their seat, not a lot to give them any hope that this season will be any different.\u201d\n\nMany miles away in Greece, Dabizas also views Newcastle\u2019s current predicament with considerable sadness.\n\n\u201cBobby knew the way that people in Newcastle wanted their team to play,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course, finance is a very important element to building success but it\u2019s not the only one. There are a lot of examples of club\u2019s over-spending and still not achieving.\n\n\u201cYou need financial power but you also have to have the right people running the football club. You have to choose the appropriate manager, the person who best suits the characteristics of Newcastle United.\u201d\n\nBefore taking on the role, Sir Bobby had claimed that he bled \u201cblack and white\u201d.\n\nA generation on, Newcastle\u2019s fans are singing the blues.
