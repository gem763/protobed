Be patient. Soon you\u2019ll see the sun earlier, because we\u2019re approaching the time to \u201cfall back,\u201d and move our clocks back an hour to Standard Time.\n\nIn the U.S., the clocks will be turned back one hour on Nov. 3, at 2 a.m. local time. (Mark your calendar, we \u201cspring ahead\u201d an hour on the second Sunday in March.)\n\nDon\u2019t like it? You could blame Ben Franklin, who is credited with promoting the practice of falling back and springing ahead as a way to cut down on the use of candles and get people out of bed earlier. Or you could move to one of the U.S. states or territories that doesn\u2019t observe daylight saving, including most of Arizona, Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, according to timeanddate.com.\n\nIn Washington state, the legislature passed a law earlier this year to stay on daylight saving time year-round. But residents of the state will likely still need to turn their clocks back with the rest of us, because federal law says that states can\u2019t stay on permanent daylight saving time without congressional approval, which is probably pretty low on Congress\u2019s to-do list. Washingtonians aren\u2019t the only ones. More than 30 states have indicated they\u2019d like to opt out of this twice-yearly ritual, a Seattle Times article reported, citing the National Council of State Legislatures.\n\nRead: How will you use the extra hour?\n\nIf you live in Europe, you\u2019ll likely have already moved your clock back to Standard Time in the wee hours of Sunday, Oct. 27 (it varies by country); in Asia, most countries do not observe the practice. Here is a world-wide breakdown. Clock-watchers take note: We could be nearing the end of clock-changing in Europe. The European Commission recently proposed ending seasonal clock changes in the European Union.\n\nSo while you may enjoy the brighter mornings \u2014 and pay for it with a darkened commute home. Though you can take comfort in the fact that at least you\u2019re not this guy, with the job of adjusting the New York City subway clocks by hand.\n\n(This story has been updated.)", "description": "Get ready for Standard Time \u2014 and early darkness", "authors": ["Angela Moore", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT698_autumn_ZG_20191021101537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
