Bernie Sanders, who suffered a heart attack this month and has limited his once-grueling campaign travel after falling ill. The moment offers the 78-year-old senator from Vermont a chance to try to assuage voter concerns about his health.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, comes to Ohio amid a string of polls that shows her support surging with likely Democratic primary voters. With her exalted status, Warren is likely to take more fire from her fellow Democratic rivals.\n\nBut the biggest storyline of the Ohio debate could revolve around how the candidates talk about the fast-moving, 3-week-old impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\n\nHere are five ways the inquiry will loom large over the debate.\n\n1) Can Joe Biden effectively punch back against Trump?\n\nThe Trump impeachment inquiry was put in motion after a member of the intelligence community filed a whistleblower's complaint raising concerns that the president was pressuring Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the younger Biden's business dealings in the Eastern European country.\n\nBiden has bristled at Trump's attacks. Trump has pushed the unsubstantiated allegation that the reason Biden, while he was vice president, pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor was to thwart an investigation of Burisma Holdings and to benefit Hunter Biden, who served on Burisma's board. No public evidence has surfaced to support that claim.\n\nIn this file photo taken on September 23, 2019 Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden makes a statement on Ukraine corruption during a press conference at the Hotel Du Pont in Wilmington, Delaware.

A Quinnipiac University poll published this month found that by a 48% to 42% margin Americans think that \"asking a foreign leader to investigate a political rival\" is, by itself, a sufficient reason to remove a president from office.\n\nImpeachment polls: Nearly 3 weeks into the Trump impeachment inquiry, polls show a shift in public opinion\n\nViolent anti-media video: Fake video of Trump shooting media and political opponents shown at conference: New York Times\n\nUSA TODAY/Ipsos poll: Perilous times for Trump: By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds\n\nBut the situation seems to also have hampered Biden.\n\nBy a 42% to 21% margin, Americans say there are valid reasons to look at the behavior of Joe and Hunter Biden in Ukraine, according to a USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll published this month.\n\nAnd more Democrats say they are somewhat satisfied (47%) than very satisfied (29%) with how Biden has responded to Trump's assertions about him and Ukraine, according to CBS News poll published Sunday. Eighteen percent of Democratic respondents said they were somewhat dissatisfied and 6% said they were very dissatisfied with Biden's response.\n\n\"No one has asserted that my son did a single thing wrong,\" Biden grumbled to reporters following a labor forum in Iowa Sunday. \"No one has asserted that I did anything wrong except the lying president.\"\n\nBiden's campaign aides have complained that too much media attention has been given to the Trump allegations.\n\nThe debate offers the former vice president a prime opportunity to make his case to directly to voters about why they shouldn't pay attention to the noise.\n\n2) Will Democratic rivals continue to go easy on Hunter Biden's business dealings?\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising if the CNN and New York Times moderators quiz candidates on whether the younger Biden's business in Ukraine, as well as China, amounted to a conflict of interest for the vice president. Biden played a key role in shaping the Obama administration's policies in those two countries.", "description": "The biggest storyline of the Ohio debate revolves around\u00a0how\u00a0the candidates talk\u00a0about the fast-moving impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R.23URVJiX.P84t8MMB5pA--~B/aD0xNzYyO3c9MjQ5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/a218c3d2bb03e26596480fe67bfedff0", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
