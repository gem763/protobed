New York and others states rejected the settlement.\n\nJames has been critical of the settlement, calling the deal \"an insult.\"\n\nThe court filing highlights the activities of Mortimer D.A. Sackler, a former Purdue board member. It alleges that Sackler transferred millions of dollars from trust companies, at least one of which was previously unknown, through Swiss bank accounts to himself as early as 2009. Some of the funds were directed to real estate companies that owned Sackler family homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons.\n\nThe New York attorney general's office believes there is much more to be learned about the family's holdings and that information is central to arriving at a just settlement. Prosecutors want the court to enforce subpoenas of companies, banks and advisers tied to Purdue and the Sacklers.\n\nForbes estimates the Sackler family fortune at $13 billion, making the Sacklers the 19th wealthiest family in the nation.\n\nA Purdue Pharma media representative told NPR that \"the company has no comment.\"\n\nPurdue Pharma and the Sacklers are seeking to derail the court challenges against them.\n\n\"Purdue has already produced more than 51 million pages of documents to the state, including voluminous financial and business information,\" a lawyer representing Purdue said in a filing in the New York case earlier this month, as cited by The New York Times, arguing that the subpoenas are \"premature.\"", "description": "The revelation comes after almost two dozen states reached a tentative settlement with the maker of Oxycontin.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/13/gettyimages-1167644936-1-_wide-468139be8883addd2cac41065233b7b18b7443ec.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
