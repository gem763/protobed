Biden Jr.\n\nThe development came amid an impeachment inquiry against President Trump connected to a request he made to the Ukrainian president asking him to investigate Mr. Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate, and his son\u2019s work in Ukraine.\n\nIt raised questions about whether Ukraine was, in effect, bowing to public and private pressure from the president of the United States, on which it has depended on for millions of dollars in aid.\n\nThe prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, who took office in August, said he intended to review 15 cases in all, including high-profile investigations of wealthy Ukrainians, among them the owner of the natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, where Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board until earlier this year.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com World Europe Ukraine-Biden-Burisma.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
