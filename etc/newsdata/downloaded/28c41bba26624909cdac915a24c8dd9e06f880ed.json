Since then he has announced plans for 40 hospital building programmes beginning with a \u00a32.7 billion cash injection for six hospitals over the next five years.\n\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \u201cIt is very striking that over 90 per cent of trust leaders are worried that there hasn\u2019t been the full, frank and open national conversation about the severe pressures facing the NHS.\n\n\u201cThe NHS faces a triple whammy of rapidly rising demand, severe workforce challenges and the need to recover from the longest and deepest funding squeeze in NHS history. Current performance levels are the worst in a decade and trying to work NHS staff harder and harder is simply not sustainable.\u201d\n\nOne trust chief executive said: \u201cWe have seen massive growth in demand over the past year (18 per cent elective referrals, 11 per cent Accident & Emergency) and it is not slowing down. \u201cEstate issues are a particular concern as we have now run out of space.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorkforce is the other concern as we cannot grow our staffing levels fast enough to keep pace with demand either.\u201d", "description": "Eight in ten hospital chief executives fear their wards will be unable to cope within a year, amid a growing social care crisis.", "authors": ["Laura Donnelly", "Health Editor", "William Hague", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/07/212303516_AFP_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT-NHS-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7N2CxnJWnYI3tCbVBgu9fglp-O-0tXy4cPh95DZ_mE.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
