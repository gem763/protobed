Together with some fine definition work with filler.\n\n(Image: skindoctorclinics/Instagram)\n\n(Image: skindoctorclinics/Instagram)\n\n\"Also note the differences in the upper lip profile in the second picture. Both pictures are a few months apart. All done under local anaesthesia only.\n\n\"No sedation. 1 incision point. Minimal downtime.\"\n\nOlivia first shot to fame in 2017 during the third series of Love Island, but has since joined the Towie cast.\n\n(Image: Beretta/Sims/REX)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nShe's already making waves during her first series on the ITV hit, including a brutal feud with fan favourite Courtney Green.\n\nThe pair were thrusting fingers at one another during the Essex lot's trip to Marbella, Courtney backed up by pals Chloe Meadows and Amber Turner.\n\nClelia Theodorou had Olivia's back, which escalated things even more.\n\nShe's also clashed with Sam Mucklow, with Sam telling MailOnline : \"If I'm honest I don't think she's good for Towie.\n\n\"The show is a bit classier than other reality shows and I feel like Liv is bringing something we've not really had before.\n\n\"I think she would be more at home on Ex on the Beach or Geordie Shore.\n\n\"I would never call a girl trashy but I wouldn't say Olivia is classy either. \"\n\nHe added: \"I do think it could have a negative effect on the show. I'm conscious about being associated with her behaviour. I wouldn't want to be associated with what happened when we arrived.\"", "description": "Olivia received a jawline, chin lipo and contouring procedure that cost a whopping two and half grand", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Skindoctorclinics Instagram", "Beretta Sims Rex", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18773211.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Olivia-Attwood.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
