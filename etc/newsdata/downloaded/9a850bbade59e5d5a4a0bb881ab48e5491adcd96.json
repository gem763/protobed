Both are up for re-election next year. They could vote to convict too, and it still wouldn\u2019t matter.\n\nRemember that impeachment, which only takes a majority vote in the House, doesn\u2019t end Trump\u2019s presidency. That only happens if two thirds of the Senate votes to convict and remove him \u2014 67 senators if they all show up.\n\nThe catch: The wall gets weaker if you factor in Trump\u2019s approval ratings. They\u2019re negative in some of the states he won in 2016.\n\nBut even if all of those senators jumped ship \u2014 which is a stretch \u2014 he'd still have more than enough votes to block conviction. That would only change if he started to lose senators from states where he's still popular, too.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\n36 Republican senators represent Trump states where he\u2019s still popular. 15 of them are up for re-election.\n\nrepresent Trump states where he\u2019s still popular. 15 of them are up for re-election. 15 Republican senators represent Trump states where his approval ratings are underwater, but only 5 of them are up for re-election.\n\nrepresent Trump states where his approval ratings are underwater, but only 5 of them are up for re-election. Trump could lose 17 senators from his red wall \u2014 or 19 Republicans if Collins and Gardner were in the mix \u2014 and still stay in office.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump believes the combination of right-wing media backing + GOP senators' fear of crossing Trump voters will save him.\n\nRight now, there are few noticeable cracks in this wall.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been corrected to show that Martha McSally is up for election to hold on to her seat in 2020.", "description": "He has a solid wall of defense even if the House impeaches him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Deu757rT4qo322MovmNa5moMzVE=/0x0:1600x900/1920x1080/2019/10/03/1570145311624.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
