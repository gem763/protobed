I know. It sounds like trying to build a coal industry without pollution. But the conversation has been\u2014to a point\u2014encouraging. I\u2019m going to walk you through the recent phases of the argument so you\u2019re right up to speed.\n\nIt all began with a well-reported piece that appeared on the left-leaning web site Splinter, in which reporter Hanna Gais obtained some emails back and forth among some people in the conservative universe; none of them tier-one figures you see on cable a lot, but nevertheless people who occupy fairly prominent positions. I won\u2019t try to summarize the whole thing, but just to give you a little taste, Gais was leaked a 2015 email in which one rightie writes to another: \u201cIn public places we avoid using certain terms. Like N and K. N\u2019s are Alaskans. Hebes are Hawaiians.\u201d Like that.\n\nWriting off that story, conservative Tim Carney in the Washington Examiner wrote that while liberals too often caricature all conservatives as racist, sometimes these charges are true, as the Splinter story proves, and that it\u2019s on conservatives to deal with that. Carney\u2019s headline states the admirable goal: \u201cIt\u2019s time to build a conservative ecosystem that doesn\u2019t welcome racists.\u201d", "description": "As some conservatives rhetorically wrestle with the racists in their ranks, they seem to keep avoiding the first step in ousting them.", "authors": ["Michael Tomasky", "Special Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568253363/190912-tomasky-conservative-racism-hero_yfm3hc", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
