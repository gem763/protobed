It was that campaign that finally gave me the courage to come forward after 12 years of silence, to report that I was a victim of sexual harassment.\n\nI am widely considered an empowered woman who, for over two decades, has stood up for women that do not have a voice. And yet when it came to reporting my own sexual harassment, I had previously felt paralysed.\n\nThere were many reasons for this, not least my worries about the sheer power imbalance between me and the member of the House of Lords who had harassed me. From afar, I watched over the years as politicians showed they were unable to tackle abuse even in their own backyard.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI also had my personal struggles to deal with. As a survivor of a forced marriage, it had taken me years to rid myself of the \u201cvictim\u201d label and now I was faced with having to accept it again. Nonetheless, I made the decision to come forward, both for my own sense of closure and in the hopes that I could be part of securing change for others.\n\nAt first, I felt relieved that I had done so. Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, the commissioner for standards, handled the whole process with total independence and dignity and the 18-month investigation was heard by a committee that included the most eminent legal minds in the country.\n\nFinally, they reached a unanimous decision that the peer I had accused \u201csexually harassed the complainant, offered her a corrupt inducement to have sex with him and warned her of unspecified consequences if she did not accept this offer\u201d. I will never forget hearing this and feeling so thankful that I had been believed, in the knowledge that so many other women are denied justice.\n\nBut I had not anticipated what would happen next.\n\nAs the committee\u2019s motion went to the House of Lords, the approval process (usually a matter of formality) was transformed into a debate on my credibility. I watched as one by one, members of the House of Lords declared their friendship with the peer, announcing their disbelief over my allegations. The investigation, my conduct and my motives for reporting were called into question. As has happened to other women, my empowerment was used against me as it was suggested that a strong activist like me would have reported sooner if the incident had really occurred. The issue of sexual harassment was not discussed. I felt slandered.\n\nDespite this horrible experience, I never lost sight of how important the investigation was. Scores of other women contacted me to share their experiences involving politicians and peers. I will never forget one brave woman who, \u201cin solidarity,\u201d was willing to share her own experience with the peer I had accused. We should never underestimate the courage it takes to report harassment, and these courageous individuals kept me going.\n\nHowever, since that investigation, I have chosen not to use the name of my harasser when speaking out. This is not because I am afraid of him. It is because, if there\u2019s one thing that debate in the House of Lords taught me, it\u2019s that the problem in Westminster is far bigger than one man.\n\nThe prime minister commented at the time that the House of Lords \u201cmust not be allowed to mark their own homework\u201d. But, although the Lords must be credited for adopting robust new procedures to deal with sexual harassment (which were proposed in a report written as a result of my complaint) it seems that both the Lords and the Commons often continue to do just that. Harassment is rife, some colleagues turn a blind eye and disciplinary processes are not adequate to hold abusers to account.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Equality Party is right when it calls Westminster a \u201chaven for abusers.\u201d There is a deeply rooted cultural problem, and it requires radical policy changes and consistent support for those who report to tackle it. That\u2019s why I am standing by the Women\u2019s Equality Party\u2019s campaign, which calls on all other parties to rise to the challenge and end abuse \u2013 starting with Westminster.\n\nJasvinder Sanghera is the founder of Karma Nirvana, a national award-winning charity that supports both men and women affected by honour-based abuse and forced marriages", "description": "The #MeToo movement amplified women\u2019s voices across the globe, including mine.
