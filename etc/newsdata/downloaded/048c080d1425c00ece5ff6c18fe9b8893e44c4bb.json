Email webnews@mirror.co.uk.\n\nThe family said he was a keen motorcyclist and would often spend weekends away with his son, Robert.\n\n\"He loved fell walking with his dog Ted and was a passionate musician who played the guitar, piano and accordion. He also loved to sing, and did his own covers of popular music,\" they said.\n\n\"Phil was a fantastic granddad to his three grandchildren, James, George and William. They adored him.\n\n\"Phil had many wonderful and happy times with his family, and these memories will be treasured by his loved ones.\n\n\"Phil will be very much missed by his wife Andrea, his two children Robert and Laura and their partners Sarah and Darren, grandchildren James, George and William, dad Bill and brother John, and all his friends and those that knew him.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nThe family added that funeral arrangements are due to be confirmed, and will be by invitation only.\n\nThey asked that no floral tributes be made but that people should instead make a donation to MIND mental health charity in memory of Mr Longcake.\n\nWitnesses looked on in horror as rescuers tried to save Mr Longcake while he was trapped on Dixon's Chimney in Carlisle, Cumbria, on Monday.\n\nA Coastguard helicopter hovered over the structure and a giant cherry picker was brought in from Glasgow - about 100 miles away - during a huge rescue operation.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nMr Longcake eventually became unresponsive and was confirmed dead hours later when his body was removed from the chimney.\n\nCumbria Police have launched an investigation into why he climbed up the Grade II-listed structure.\n\nCarlisle City Council said he climbed temporary metal ladders put in place for maintenance work within a walled and gated compound.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe lowest point of the ladders was 15ft above the ground.\n\nPolice were first alerted at about 2.20am amid reports that shouts and wailing could be heard. Mr Longcake was hanging from the chimney in cold weather.\n\nHis left leg was trapped between brickwork and a ladder.\n\nAn attempt to rescue Mr Longcake using a helicopter was abandoned due to safety concerns.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAfter a public appeal from police, a specialist cherry picker big enough to reach the top of the structure, which is attached to an old mill, was brought in.\n\nRescuers were using drones to assess the scene.\n\nMr Longcake's body was brought down by specialist firefighters, from Lancashire Fire and Rescue, at about 4.45pm and pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n(Image: @Cumbriapolice/Twitter)\n\nVolunteers from Penrith Mountain Rescue Team were also at the scene.\n\nPolice and fire officials later said attempts to rescue Mr Longcake using a helicopter were not possible \"due to the precarious position\" he was in and the potential for the downdraft to knock him loose.\n\nJohn Walkden, of Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters could not just climb the ladder like Mr Longcake had done.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"This was nearly 300ft in the air, with poor and unsafe access.\n\n\"We had some professional steeplejacks on scene who had been there since the early hours.\n\n\"They had previously worked on the chimney and their assessment was that if anyone tried to ascend the ladder, it could effectively have dislodged the man who was trapped at the top.\"\n\nStuart Hook, the station manager who led the operation, said the ladder was unstable and firefighters tried to reassure Mr Longcake that they were working on a plan to get him down.\n\nHe told the News and Star: \"The whole top section of the ladder was not fully fixed in place.\u201d\n\nThere were fears firefighters could be killed if they climbed the ladder and Mr Longcake fell and crashed into them.\n\nMr Hook said the helicopter was the man's best chance of survival but it was ruled out because it was too dangerous.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe crew said - with 100 per cent certainty - he\u2019d fall (due to the downdraft) if they tried to get him.\n\n\"It was very frustrating. Unfortunately, there was no way we could get this gentleman down quickly and safely.\u201d\n\nSamaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.
