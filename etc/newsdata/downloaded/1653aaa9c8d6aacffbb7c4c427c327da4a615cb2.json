The Washington Times takes a weekly look at some of them that may have flown under the radar.\n\nSen. Cory A. Booker on Thursday released a plan intended to cut child poverty in the U.S. by about two-thirds. It includes an \u201callowance\u201d for families with children, expanded federal welfare programs and new benefits regardless of a person\u2019s immigration status.\n\n\u201cIn the richest country in the world, we have a moral responsibility to look after each other and make sure that every child living in America has the opportunity to grow and thrive,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat said.\n\nMr. Booker wants to expand the child tax credit and start a payment program that would give at least $250 per month to families with children.\n\nHe also would expand by 30% the maximum benefit under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, and increase funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program by 40%.\n\nThe senator also wants to change child support policies by reducing orders during periods of incarceration and create a new jobs program targeted toward people living in poverty and people receiving federal assistance.\n\nMr. Booker also would eliminate eligibility requirements based on immigration status for all \u201csafety net\u201d programs, as well as health coverage and subsidies available under Obamacare.\n\nBiden on guns\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Wednesday released a package of new gun control measures that includes a ban and buyback of \u201cassault\u201d weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nUnder Mr. Biden\u2019s plan, owners of certain kinds of semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines would be forced to sell them to the government or register them with the federal government under the National Firearms Act.\n\nHis campaign said he also supports requiring background checks for all gun sales, extending the amount of time a gun dealer has to wait to hear back from the FBI before proceeding with a sale, and ending all online sales of firearms, ammunition, kits and gun parts.\n\nMr. Biden also wants to give incentives to states to develop their own gun licensing and \u201cred flag\u201d laws, so law enforcement can temporarily seize guns from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nHe also wants to put the U.S. on a path where 100% of the guns sold in the U.S. are \u201csmart\u201d guns that work only for owners and \u201cauthorized users\u201d of the firearms.\n\nWarren on lobbying tax\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren announced a new tax plan Wednesday that seeks to raise government revenue from \u201cexcessive lobbying\u201d to help insulate Congress from the influence of big corporations.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat already has vowed to implement a \u201cwealth tax\u201d and is now pushing for a new tax on \u201cevery corporation and trade organization that spends over $500,000 per year lobbying our government.\u201d\n\nUnder her plan, businesses that spend between $500,000 to $1 million on lobbying would pay a 35% tax on that spending. The tax climbs from there, with every dollar over $1 million spent on lobbying being slapped with a 60% tax and every dollar over $5 million being slapped with a 75% tax.\n\n\u201cMy new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Boeing and Comcast,\u201d she said in a Medium post. \u201cSure, this may mean that some corporations and industry groups will choose to reduce their lobbying expenditures, raising less tax revenue down the road \u2014 but in that case, all the better.\n\n\u201cAnd if instead corporations continue to engage in excessive lobbying, my lobbying tax will raise even more revenue for Congress, agencies, and federal watchdogs to fight back,\u201d Ms. Warren said.\n\nShe said the money raised from the new tax would pay for a new Lobbying Defense Trust Fund that could help beef up the Office of Technology Assessment and the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nShe said the money also would be used to establish a new \u201cOffice of the Public Advocate.\u201d\n\nCastro and workers\u2019 rights\n\nFormer housing secretary Julian Castro on Wednesday released a plan intended to bolster workers\u2019 rights and strengthen the power of labor unions.\n\nMr. Castro would work to bar states from instituting right-to-work laws that prevent people from joining unions as a condition of employment and require large corporations to reserve a third of their board seats for workers elected by \u201cnon-management\u201d employees, among other priorities.\n\nMr. Castro said the issue is \u201cpersonal\u201d for him because his grandmother worked her entire life as a maid, a cook and a babysitter and his mother was a community organizer in the Chicano movement.\n\n\u201cThis platform will spark economic opportunity, empower workers with justice and dignity, and ensure all workers are included in our future prosperity,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Castro also would expand federal employment protections for farm workers and create a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d path to U.S. citizenship for agricultural workers and their families in the U.S., regardless of immigration status.\n\nHe also would work to guarantee at least three months of paid family and medical leave for every American per year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
