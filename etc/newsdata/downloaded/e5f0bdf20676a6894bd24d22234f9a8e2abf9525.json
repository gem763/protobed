Sometimes, all you have to do is listen. By the time I stood at a very loud party in a lavishly decorated uptown venue a few months ago, I had heard a lot. I had written about the private lives and cultural practices of very wealthy New Yorkers and now, for every person who ran the other way upon seeing me, another one wanted to tell me things. Often, perhaps because I had supposedly lifted a veil on a secretive, private world, people talked to me about the ultimate secretive, private topic: sex.\n\nI often heard about affairs. While the names and players sometimes surprised me, the facts did not: what anthropologists call \u201cextra pair copulations\u201d are common. In her meta-analysis of 133 cultures worldwide, anthropologist Meredith Small found not a single one without infidelity.\n\nI heard about high-earning men having affairs \u201cbecause they could,\u201d and about wives with money of their own having affairs \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t afraid to.\u201d This was no surprise. The anthropological data show that she who brings home the bacon (or mongongo nuts or small animals caught in nets) has increased clout and autonomy. Indeed, sociologists tell us it\u2019s no coincidence that, as women have entered the U.S. workforce over the last decades\u201434 percent of women in the U.S. worked in 1950, versus nearly 58 percent by 2012\u2014they have also begun to close the \u201cinfidelity gap,\u201d cheating at close to the same rates as men, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nThe affairs people told me about made sense, seen through the prisms of anthropology and sociology. And then, something surprised me.\n\nAt the party that night, the music blared. Some women and I were chatting about sex. A 30-something fashion plate and mother leaned toward me and whispered, \u201cWhat about the [inaudible]?\u201d\n\nIt sounded like she said, \u201cpushy whistlers.\u201d\n\nSorry?\n\n\u201cThe pussy whisperers!\u201d she repeated. \u201cThe trainers who have affairs with their clients during summer in the Hamptons!\u201d\n\nIt sounded like a variation on the pool boy clich\u00e9: a hot working guy, the beautiful wife of a wealthy man who works in the city during the week, the kids at sleep-away camp\u2026But I hadn\u2019t heard the term\u2014which implied a particular skill set, and a special knowledge about what women want\u2014before. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cif these men are attractive and attentive to their female clients\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pussy whisperers,\u201d she interrupted, \u201care women!\u201d\n\n***\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Lesbian,\u201d \u201cBicurious\u201d and \u201cMARBLE\u2014Married but Lesbian\u201d are all vernacular terms that point to a popular awareness that female lust can be shape-shifting, flexible. Lots of people in my world knew the famous story of the gorgeous mommy who had left her successful husband for her charismatic female spin instructor. The couple was out and proud, spinning side by side. But \u201cpussy whisperers\u201d? The descriptor hinted at a practice that would seem off the map for the women I had written about, to say the least.\n\nOr not.\n\nThanks to the inroads paved by LGBTQ activists and feminists in recent decades, as well as the work of mostly female sex researchers, there seems to be a new openness in discussing sex and gender not as we think it should be or want it to be, but as it is actually experienced. This may in part explain why what we might call \u201cfemale flexuality\u201d is having a zeitgeist-y moment. From \u201cit\u201d girl Cara Delevingne\u2019s involvements with both women and men to Kristin Stewart\u2019s recent declaration that me not defining [myself as gay or straight] right now\u2026is what I\u2019m all about\u201d; from engaged-to-a-guy Piper\u2019s not-so-straight affairs on Orange is the New Black and even Gloria Vanderbilt\u2019s recent revelation, while promoting her new book, of a girl/girl dalliance at Miss Porter\u2019s back in the day; to Skirt Club, a women-only roving party in London, Miami and Manhattan, where the female owner who is married to a man says most of those who come to \u201cplay\u201d with other women are in relationships with men, too\u2014\u201cheteroflexible\u201d women are entering the mainstream. Articles in women\u2019s magazines (\u201cA Closer Look at Women Who\u2019ve Left Their Husbands for Other Women,\u201d for instance) and headlines that alternately trumpet and vociferously deny that studies show women\u2019s preferences are \u201cmostly gay or bi,\u201d give it all a news-y spin.\n\nA former trainer whose mostly female clients lived uptown and in the Hamptons recounted that it was not unusual for her married female clients to come on to her.\n\nSex researchers have also been focused on female flexuality. Based on results of a 10-year longitudinal study of 79 women, University of Utah sex researcher Lisa Diamond coined the term \u201cfemale sexual fluidity\u201d to describe the malleability of female desire. Dr. Diamond discovered that circumstances\u2014an accepting community, an open-minded female friend, an emotional connection\u2014might contribute to a woman who has spent years or decades feeling and being heterosexual to have sex with a woman. And decide to keep doing so. Or not.\n\nOther research has focused on female desire. Meredith Chivers, associate professor of psychology, at Queen\u2019s University in Canada found that women may have more category-defying tendencies than men (straight women are more likely to be excited by lesbian porn than straight men are by gay male porn, for example), and be turned on by a wider array of images and fantasies.\n\nDr. Alicia Walker, visiting assistant professor of sociology at Missouri State University, conducted a pilot study of women who are married to men but seek out female partners online for in-person sexual encounters. These women refused titles like \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cbisexual,\u201d identifying themselves instead as motivated by what they described as their \u201cstrong\u201d libidos and \u201cfreakiness\u201d to search for clandestine sexual encounters with other women. Dr. Walker uses the term \u201cundercover,\u201d as one of her interview subjects did, to describe the desire for women that hums alongside and coexists with their heterosexuality. While we\u2019re rethinking categories, as such behaviors might lead us to do, let\u2019s put to rest the notion that it\u2019s all \u201cjust a phase\u201d for younger women who are \u201cgay until graduation\u201d; a recent Glamour survey of 1,015 women between 18 and 44 found 47 percent had been attracted to another woman, and nearly 1 in 3 reported a sexual experience with another woman.\n\nIn spite of overall social shifts and trends and statistics, it seemed odd that the hierarchy-and status-conscious married women with children I spent time with\u2014women who live in what can certainly be described as a heteronormative culture\u2014might go against tribal custom and get sexually involved with women\u2014particularly those who might fall into the \u201chelp\u201d category. But there were specific circumstances that suggested they might not be an exception to the sex research data. Like women in Hollywood, those I studied live in a body-display culture with unyielding standards. Women must be ultra-fit, beautiful and youthful. Period. Some took two exercise classes daily. And I knew from the way they gushed about their instructors, rushed to sign up for their classes, followed them on social media and confided in them as a previous generation had their hairdressers, that many established close bonds with these \u201cbody shamans.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s a supermodel, a Netflix series, a moniker like \u201cpussy whisperer\u201d to describe a relationship, or a study by a sex researcher, our culture is currently experimenting with the notion that the course of female sexuality cannot necessarily be predicted, defined, or confined. And that we might need new vocabulary\u2014in addition to straight, bi and gay\u2014to describe it.\n\n\u201cYes, I know about the female [exercise] instructors who seduce women away from their husbands,\u201d a beautiful blonde socialite told me with an \u201ceverybody knows that\u201d wave of her hand. A man who socialized and worked with a group of wealthy, married Hamptonites told me about two women, each married and avowedly heterosexual, each having a passionate affair with a woman\u2014one with a woman who was her exercise coach. A therapist told me about a married woman who brought the female trainer she had long fancied on a trip to train her\u2014and they ended up in bed. Her client, said the therapist, \u201cbelieved it \u2018didn\u2019t count as cheating.\u201d A master of the universe, I was told, found out his wife was sleeping with her female physical therapist and forgave her, presuming she would end it. She refused; they divorced.\n\nA former trainer whose mostly female clients lived uptown and in the Hamptons recounted that it was not unusual for her married female clients to come on to her. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018I think about you all the time,\u2019 \u201d she said over lunch at a Brooklyn restaurant, where her physique (tall and ripped) and classic beauty drew admiring stares. She recalled that, before she moved West and traded training for a 9-5 job, she sometimes used that erotic connection to motivate clients. Trainers want people to succeed and feel motivated, she explained, and \u201cif being attracted to us helps, O.K.\u201d She also conceded that in her trainer days she had mixed business with pleasure (she used an expression that was far saltier) and knew of other female trainers who slept with their married, assumed straight female clients, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the new workplace affair, but with a different \u2018workplace,\u2019 and genders switched around,\u201d observed a Manhattan workout aficionada who was aware of the whispers about pussy whisperers. She noted that she had heard the term \u201cstraight whisperer\u201d to describe the phenomenon, as in, able to whisper a straight woman into bed.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it just that when you\u2019re a woman who has it all, having a female lover is an experience you might allow yourself to have?\u201d a woman who summers in Sagaponack mused, surprised that anyone would be surprised.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019m not at all surprised to hear about assumed heterosexual women having affairs with their female trainers,\u201d said Dr. Walker, who teaches a popular \u201csociology of sexuality\u201d class at Missouri State University, by phone. \u201cThe more honest dialogue we have about women\u2019s sexual practices, the more we find these types of experiences among women who don\u2019t claim a label other than heterosexual.\u201d While there are no hard and fast numbers or large-scale statistics on how many avowedly heterosexual women pursue liaisons with other women, they may be higher than those suggested by the Glamour study. That\u2019s because, as psychologists, sex researchers and sociologists tell us, it is notoriously difficult to coax interview subjects to disclose the full extent of their stigmatized or taboo behaviors. This is especially the case with women, who face particular biases\u2014slut shaming, sexism and double standards among them\u2014when it comes to fully and frankly disclosing their sexuality. And still, many experts echo the observations of Yale lecturer of psychiatry Binnie Klein, who told O Magazine: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that a change in sexual orientation is imaginable to more people than ever before, and there\u2019s more opportunity\u2014and acceptance\u2014to cross over the line.\u201d\n\nMs. Klein added that six of her married female patients had become involved with women over the last several years. Rachel Blakeman, a psychoanalyst in private practice on the Upper East Side, concurred. In her clinical experience, women may be more likely to cross the line in their minds than in reality. \u201cFemale sexual desire is more complex and fluid than male sexual desire,\u201d she said. \u201cSome women who identify as heterosexual and exclusively partner with men, have erotic desires that extend to women. The reasons each woman chooses to fulfill her sexual desires for another woman at a particular time or under certain circumstances, as opposed to resisting\u2026or feeling it less powerfully at other times, is unique to each woman\u2014but what these women all share is a sexual fluidity.\u201d Perhaps this is why Joanne Fleisher, LCSW offers a \u201cWorkshop for Married Women Attracted to Women\u201d on May 22 in Philadelphia, and Match.com created a category called \u201cWomen Who Leave John for Jane.\u201d\n\nThe anthropological data suggest that female flexuality is not just a Western thing. In Lesotho, a small country surrounded by South Africa, women whose husbands are away for extended periods may take a motsoalle, or special female friend. And in Suriname, working-class Creole women who are called mati have relationships with both men and women, not infrequently living with their female lovers and children. Many !Kung adolescent girls in Namibia experiment with other girls sexually, with adults viewing it as \u201cinevitable and normal,\u201d according to anthropologist Melvin Konner of Emory University.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a supermodel, a Netflix series, a moniker like \u201cpussy whisperer\u201d to describe a relationship, or a study by a sex researcher, our culture is currently experimenting with the notion that the course of female sexuality cannot necessarily be predicted, defined, or confined. And that we might need new vocabulary\u2014in addition to straight, bi and gay\u2014to describe it. Dr. Diamond\u2019s work suggests that in particular, we have yet to wrap our minds around how much female sexuality has to do with context.\n\nDecades ago, social scientists had already coined a term for the tendency of women in places like women\u2019s prisons and all-girls\u2019 schools to have sex with one another (men have sex with men in prison, of course, but \u201cheterosexual women are significantly more likely to have consensual sex with female partners in prison compared to heterosexual men in prison,\u201d noted Dr. Dylan Selterman, a lecturer at the University of Maryland\u2019s psychology department). They attributed such \u201csituational lesbianism\u201d that occurred when there were few or no men around to a psychosocial dynamic they rather unfortunately dubbed \u201cthe harem effect.\u201d The exoticism of the term smacks of an anxious assertion: \u201cIt can\u2019t happen here.\u201d An alternative descriptor\u2014such as \u201csegresexuality\u201d\u2014may more accurately suggest that, wherever women spend a great deal of time with other women in the relative absence of men, female flexuality increases the likelihood that those who are assumedly heterosexual may become sexually involved with a woman nonetheless.\n\n***\n\nWhich brings us back to the pussy whisperers. How, I wondered, could women who did not have their own money and income act on their flexuality? Wouldn\u2019t their financial dependency, and their dependent offspring, along with their traditionally gender-scripted marriages and comparatively conservative culture, hold them hostage to some sort of heterosexual normativity?\n\nPerhaps. But not necessarily. Because along with economics and autonomy, experts tell us, it turns out that opportunity also plays a significant role in whether someone has an affair. Women flooding the workforce in recent decades found not just earning power and independence, but increased exposure to potential sexual partners.\n\n\u201cOpportunity\u201d looks a little different in the Hamptons, among a group of largely non-working women who are out East for the whole summer, often attending sex-segregated luncheons and fundraisers and trunk shows, socializing in weekday evenings with mostly other women, and working assiduously on their bodies in the presence and with the guidance of female trainers, some of them gay, while their husbands work in the city. These women have autonomy of a different sort, and opportunity aplenty.\n\n\u201cContextual variables make it more or less likely for women to act on their female flexuality, and the Hamptons is just one place worldwide where a perfect storm of factors can aid its expression,\u201d believes biological anthropologist Natalia Reagan. Her viral Huffington Post Science piece \u201cHooray for Gay Animals\u201d addressed the spectrum of sexual behavior in a variety of animal species\u2014including our own.\n\nAll this may be a summer cocktail potent enough to render some avowedly heterosexual women, as the data suggest is not uncommon, something else as well: \u201csegresexuals\u201d who are \u201cgay until Labor Day.\u201d\n\nWednesday Martin, Ph.D. is the author of the No. 1 New York Times best-seller Primates of Park Avenue, now available for pre-order in paperback.
