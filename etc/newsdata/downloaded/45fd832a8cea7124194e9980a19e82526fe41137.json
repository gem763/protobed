But is it worth committing now? And if you do decide to invest, which bank offers the best Help to Buy ISA interest rate?\n\nHow does a Help to Buy ISA work?\n\nLucy Mullins, Co-Founder and Head of Membership at StepLadder \u2013 the start-up helping young people climb onto the housing ladder, explained the scheme to Cosmopolitan UK.\n\n\"The government will boost the money you have saved by 25% with a maximum bonus of \u00a33,000 a year,\" she said.\" Basically, if you save \u00a3100, the government will give you a bonus of \u00a325, making your total \u00a3125.\n\n\"What\u2019s more, like other ISAs, the money you receive is tax free so you could earn up to 2.6% interest, depending on who you open your account with. Help to Buy ISAs are available from a range of different banks and building societies so it is well worth shopping around (although tax treatment is subject to individual circumstances and change.)\"\n\nPhoto credit: baona - Getty Images More\n\nWe've laid out all the info, so you can compare which bank offers the best Help to Buy ISA for you...\n\nNote: AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate, or the interest rate you earn on your savings\n\nHalifax Help to Buy ISA\n\nThe rate for the Halifax ISA is a reasonable 2.25% AER / 2.25% tax-free. You can make unlimited withdrawals, too, but as with any Help to Buy ISA, you won\u2019t be able to claim the Government bonus on the funds you withdraw.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nBarclays Help to Buy ISA\n\nBarclays has a high interest rate of 2.58% AER / 2.55% tax-free per year, but only those with an existing account will be able to open online - the others will need to visit a branch. The interest rate is variable, so it's probably best for someone who's willing to keep an eye on it... if you're the 'open and leave'-type, this might not be the ISA for you.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nNationwide Help to Buy ISA\n\nThe Nationwide ISA offers a 2.5% AER/tax-free interest rate but, unlike Barclays, allows you to \"split\", meaning you can pay into both a Help to Buy and Cash ISA in the same year. Ideal if you're intent on saving as much as you can, as quickly as you can.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nNatwest Help to Buy ISA\n\nMuch like the above, the NatWest ISA has a 2.50% AER / 2.47% tax-free rate and will also let you split. There's no withdrawal fee, and it's easy to open in the branch, online or over the phone.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nLloyds Help to Buy ISA\n\nThe Lloyds IA has a 1.50% tax free/AER variable interest, but is easy to open. Plus, the bank will let you know if interest rates change, which is nice.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nHSBC Help to Buy ISA\n\nHSBC allows you to open a Help to Buy ISA online, in a branch, by telephone or by post, and the rate is 2.25% AER / 2.23% tax free.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nSantander Help to Buy ISA\n\nSantander has a rate of 1.75% AER/tax-free, but that is upped to 2.25% AER/tax-free if you\u2019re part of 1|2|3 World or Santander Select.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nIs a Help to Buy ISA worth it for me?\n\nAs with any lending scheme, there are chances the Help to Buy ISA might not be quite right for you.\n\nFirstly, it's worth bearing in mind when you want to buy. \"You have until 30th November 2029 to continue saving, and you\u2019ll still get the bonus as long as you use it by the 1st of December 2030,\" explains Lucy. But, as you can only save a maximum of \u00a3200 per month after the initial \u00a31,200 deposit, it takes nearly five years to save the \u00a312,000 you need to gain the maximum government bonus - so maybe it's not perfect if you've got your sights set on being an owner ASAP.\n\nStory continues", "description": "There's limited time to make \u00a3\u00a3 on your house deposit", "authors": ["Abigail Malbon"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9Yo4bRjFPp8lLe.gPbPwhg--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/509d449b871fe09b673d35bb054dd623", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
