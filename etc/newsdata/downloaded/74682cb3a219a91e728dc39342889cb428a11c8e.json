And its 'official' range is quoted as 254 miles.\n\nOfficial ranges are the figures achieved during Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) cycles, which is the measure used for all official miles per gallon stats in conventional vehicles and ranges of electric-powered cars.\n\nHowever, the What Car? test found that the real-world range of a much lower 196 miles.\n\nThat's 58 miles shy of the claimed distance between charges - almost a quarter (23 per cent) less than the Tesla sales brochure will lead you to believe.\n\nHow What Car? tests electric-car ranges At the start of the test the car's battery is fully depleted and then recharged via a smart charging cable with a built-in meter. Driving measurements are taken at a test track so traffic conditions don't affect the result, with the car following a route that simulates a mix of town, A-road and motorway driving. Testing is conducted with the lights on, climate control set to 22 degrees and when the ambient temperature is between 10 and 15 degrees. Finally, the car is recharged using the smart cable so that the amount of energy expended can be measured and the Real Range extrapolated.\n\nAnd the difference between claimed and real-world driving distance is even greater in the most expensive variant.\n\nThe Model 3 Performance, which is the priciest sold to UK customers costing \u00a349,140, is the quickest of Tesla's small saloon.\n\nIt can hit 60mph from a standstill in just 3.2 seconds and 162mph flat out.\n\nA Tesla Spokesman told This is Money: 'These results are wrong and not reflective of the WLTP results determined by European regulators due to the fact that WhatCar? conducted an abridged test without fully depleting the vehicle's battery.\n\n'Using only a fraction of a car's total range and attempting to extrapolate that result as a proxy for its full useable range is simply incorrect.\n\n'We also believe the vehicles included in the tests were not tested under the same exact conditions, which means the test results cannot be directly compared.\n\n'True comparative results can only be achieved under lab conditions, which is why standard test procedures like WLTP are used to measure and compare vehicle range.'\n\nWhat Car? editor Steven Huntingford refuted Tesla's remarks.\n\n'Unlike the official WLTP tests, which are carried out in a laboratory, What Car?'s Real Range test reflects the way people actually drive. But we've still put stringent methodologies in place to ensure that the results are robust,' he explained to us.\n\n'One of the few remaining concerns for people considering an electric car is that the battery will run flat and leave them stranded, and we're not going to overcome this by being opaque about what's realistic.\n\n'The Model 3 is an excellent car in many respects, but due to the limitations of WLTP you'll need to drive very cautiously to get near its official range.\n\n'We believe it's important that prospective buyers know this going in so they can be sure the car is suitable for their needs.'\n\nThe Model 3 is an important car for Tesla, as it is the American firm's first attempt at an 'affordable' family model\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a These are the vital statistics for the Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus (left) and Model 3 Performance (right)\n\nThis is Money editor Simon Lambert recently spent a week with this version of the Model 3, describing it as 'a seriously good car and testimony to what can be achieved with an electric vehicle'.\n\nThe range is longer than any other example in the line-up, too, according to WLTP figures.\n\nIt's advertised to be able to go for 329 miles on a full charge - which is the equivalent of travelling from London to Carlisle without having to stop to replenish the batteries.\n\nHowever, What Car?'s measurement found the real range was just 239 miles.\n\nThat's 90 miles short of the claimed figure and 27 per cent less than what official stats suggests.\n\nIf you are planning a trip from London to Carlisle in one, it means you will have to stop shortly after passing Wigan to plug the vehicle in, or else be stranded somewhere on the side of the M6.\n\nThis is Money editor Simon Lambert has driven the Model 3 and described it as 'a seriously good car and testimony to what can be achieved with an electric vehicle'\n\nTesla UK told This is Money that the official range figures - based on WLTP tests - should only be used for comparative purposes\n\nWhile these figures are fairly disappointing - especially for the handful of Britons who have already taken delivery of their Model 3 - it isn't an anomaly when you compare it to the rest of the electric-car market.\n\nAs the table below shows, when What Car? has tested battery-electric vehicles from other manufacturers in the past, the range tends to fall well short of claims.\n\nFor instance, the VW e-Golf in the real world is 69 miles short of the official figure.\n\nHowever, with a claimed range of just 186 miles, it means it is 37 per cent away from the advertised distance quoted for a full battery charge.\n\nIn fact, when you compare all the test results for the real-world measurements, the Model 3 still has a much longer range than many other plug-in models tested.", "description": "When tested by What Car?, the entry-level Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus was 58 miles short of claims.
