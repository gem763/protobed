He described the mall as top-notch.\n\n\u201cThis is a first of its kind. All the well- known shops are going to be there. Our government is bringing services closer to the people. There is no need for people to take transport to go to Cape Town or Wynberg to pay their accounts,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the construction of the mall has changed people\u2019s bad perception about the area.\n\n\u201cMore than 500 job opportunities including cleaners, security, tellers and others will be available. And just in the construction phase there were 39 subcontractors hired and that created job opportunities to more than 2000 people,\u201d he said.\n\nIn terms of security, he assured customers of their safety.\n\nResident Nosiseko Malgas from Browns Farm reiterated Mbaliswana\u2019s sentiment that the opening of the mall will bring services closer to people. However, she said her concern is nepotism when it comes to hiring people.\n\n\u201cI wish people can be hired based on merit rather than hiring them because he or she is connected to somebody else,\u201d said Malgas.\n\nMbaliswana stated that for job applications people can drop the CV in councillor Mboniswa Ncitha\u2019s office in Philippi.", "description": "A multi-million rand Junxion Mall, in Phillipi, is expected to open its doors for trading next month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8678/5c0e5e37512f4de38d7ba7132d931e18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-28"}
