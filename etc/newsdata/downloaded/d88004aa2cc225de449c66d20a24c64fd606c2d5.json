Older children will get a curated selection of pop songs, all of which will have been chosen by Spotify staff to be \"appropriate and relevant for older kids\u200b\".\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn addition to keeping children limited to a selection of kid-friendly tracks, the app will allow parents to give children their own login, and therefore keep those songs from being added to the adults' listening history. The company said it was aware that kids have their own tastes that are often very different from parents, and the need for a separate app was shown in research.\n\nThe Spotify Kids app also brings a different design, which the company said had been focused on making navigation easy.\n\nThe editors deciding the content in the app have come from a variety of other kid-focused companies, Spotify said, such as Nickelodeon and Disney.\n\nThe app is currently only available in Ireland, but will be rolling out across the rest of the world. Users need the Spotify Premium Family account, which allows people to pay one subscription for everyone in the household, but the app will be free for those with that subscription.\n\nSpotify said it had been launched in beta for now, as a trial, because it recognised the app is a \"new space\". It will also look to bring other kinds of audio content to the app as it develops, the company said, suggesting that podcasts and other shows could be added.", "description": "Spotify has launched a special version of its service for children.
