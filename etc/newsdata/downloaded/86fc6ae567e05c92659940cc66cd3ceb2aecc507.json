There was one example of a hairdresser who was trained to be a riveter.\n\n'The production was so secret that people who were born and bred in Salisbury had no idea about it until the documentary was made.\n\n'Production carried on right until the end of the war. Their contribution was absolutely massive, producing planes which were sorely needed as so many were being lost.'\n\nA documentary by Ethem Cetintas and Karl Howman called 'The Secret Spitfires' was released in 2016 about those who built the aircraft in secret during the war.", "description": "The little-known operation involved just a few hundred people who operated in requisitioned car garages, sheds, workshops and factories in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19743876-0-image-a-565_1571147914628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
