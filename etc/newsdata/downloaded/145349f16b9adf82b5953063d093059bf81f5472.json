In seeming to elide Moynihan\u2019s comments in the October 7, 1971, phone call (one of two recorded conversations he had with Nixon on this matter), I may have suggested that he wasn\u2019t complicit in this troubling exchange. I am glad that Hoberman pointed out the omission and that I have the opportunity to make clear my understanding of Moynihan\u2019s role in this disturbing presidential seminar.\n\nPrior to the October 7 phone call, Nixon received a memo from Moynihan, who had left the administration as a domestic adviser in late 1970 to return to teaching at Harvard. The document, which makes for unpleasant reading, lays bare that Moynihan shared the view that intelligence was something that could be measured with a single number (a theory that has been disproved by the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, among others), and that he took seriously a genetic \u201cranking\u201d of races.\n\n\u201cPsychologists now think they know something of the ranking of the major races,\u201d Moynihan wrote to Nixon. \u201cAsians first; Caucasians second; Africans third. This latter point is not settled. It is an inference from the testing of persons of African descent in Caucasian settings.\u201d Moynihan, it turns out, was actually the immediate source of Nixon\u2019s later taped blathering, though no doubt Nixon only saw the theory as confirmation of what he\u2019d long assumed.\n\nMoynihan was an influential thinker on race and social policy, and he later became a Democratic senator representing New York. He was a member of the generation of liberals who turned on the claims of the Great Society and became labeled as \u201cneoconservatives.\u201d As he explained in a letter to the novelist John Updike in 1992, Moynihan believed he had found evidence in new empirical studies disproving that social policy based on social science had any impact on social change.\n\nThe memo and the ensuing conversation happened because Nixon had asked Moynihan for comment on the Harvard professor Richard Herrnstein\u2019s article, \u201cI.Q.,\u201d in the September 1971 Atlantic. \u201cHerrnstein is, of course, very much worth reading,\u201d Moynihan explained in his memo. \u201cThe findings of intelligence testing, which he summarizes, have profound implications for social policy.\u201d\n\nIn his article, Herrnstein argued that IQ is the dominant factor in social, academic, professional, and even sexual success. He prophesied a scary \u201cmeritocracy\u201d determined by IQ, with people locked into genetic subclasses: \u201cWhen people can freely take their natural level in society, the upper classes will, virtually by definition, have greater capacity than the lower.\u201d", "description": "A reader pushes back on the notion that Moynihan was \u201cquiet\u201d in the face of Richard Nixon\u2019s racism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_615319650/facebook.jpg?1565910006", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
