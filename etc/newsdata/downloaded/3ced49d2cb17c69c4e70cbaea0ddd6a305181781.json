Just know, this is going to be the headline forever, 'Jo\u2019s pregnant again,' \" Joanna said, adding that her husband with kids is like him with businesses. \"There's never too many.\"\n\n\"He\u2019s like, \u2018I just think we can keep having them,\u2019 \" Joanna continued. \"I think Chip just loves a full plate.\"\n\nThe couple are currently parents to five kids: Drake, 14, Ella Rose, 13, Duke, 11, Emmie Kay, 9, and baby Crew, 1.\n\nShortly after giving birth to Crew last year, Joanna acknowledged Chip wants a sister for their youngest, an option that still seems to be on thetable. \"I love the process of being pregnant,\" she told \"Today\" anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb. \"I love giving birth.\"\n\nThe Gaineses recently added another project to their pile. The couple is opening a boutique hotel in Waco, Texas, in 2021.\n\nJoanna announced the project on her social media channels and in a post on the Magnolia blog.
