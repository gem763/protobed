Many critics hope it will be the last.\n\nThe reviews have been every bit as savage as the lead character\u2019s treatment of the myriad cartel hooligans who find themselves stabbed, shot and blown up over the course of an hour and 29 minutes.\n\nBut, like it or love it, this movie gets one thing right: like Sylvester Stallone\u2019s other pictures, it reflects the times in terms of how many Americans see themselves in this turbulent world.\n\nDavid Morrell\u2019s novel First Blood came out in 1972, the nadir of American self-confidence. Torn by a controversial war, buffeted by counter-cultural exhibitionism, disillusioned by Watergate, and stung by stagflation, the USA was feeling anything but okay. All our heroes were dark.\n\nIn an interview, Morrell claimed World War II Medal of Honor recipient Audie Murphy served as a model for \u201cRambo.\u201d But, Murphy was a celebrated hero who returned from war to launch a successful movie and country singing career.\n\nIn Morrell\u2019s book, Rambo is an unemployed drifter with PTSD who runs afoul of local sheriff. In the violent, senseless, tragic melee that follows, pretty much everybody\u2014including Rambo\u2014winds up dead.\n\nWhen Stallone translated the book to film, Rambo had picked up a first name: John. And his character was markedly different from the novel\u2019s depiction.\n\nPart of that was a response to box office demands. Six years before the release of \u201cRambo, First Blood,\u201d Stallone had scored a box-office smash with \u201cRocky.\u201d And the first rule of Hollywood is: Don\u2019t mess with success. Rambo was Rocky with a gun.\n\nBut the film also reflected Hollywood\u2019s changing aesthetic, one that was shifting along with the nation\u2019s as it emerged from the shadow of Vietnam into the dawn of Reagan\u2019s more self-confident and self-assured America. In 1982, when Rambo debuted, it was okay to honor and respect veterans. It was okay to be patriotic.\n\nStallone started a rush of films in which Americans were the good guys again. Even kids got into the act in Red Dawn (1984).\n\nIn subsequent sequels, Rambo evolved into a super hero. While Reagan stood strong against our enemies in the real world, Rambo crushed them under foot on film. He redeemed us in Vietnam (1985) bringing the POW\u2019s home. He kicked Soviet butt in Afghanistan (1988).\n\nTwo decades later, a more politically correct Rambo was back in Obama\u2019s America (2008) battling mercenaries and rescuing missionaries.\n\nNow, a decade later Trump\u2019s Rambo is on the US-Mexico border, forced out of retirement by rampaging cartels who mess with the wrong man.\n\nCritic Miles Surrey basically called the movie \u201cHome Alone\u201d (1990) on steroids. Instead of a home invasion, Rambo is defending the American homeland with guns, bombs, and booby-traps.\n\nMany reviewers complained of excessive violence, which is weird given how many of the same gushed over the John Wick films. On the other hand, there is lots of fretting over the new Joker film, with some even fearing it will spark mass shootings. Americans, it seems, are as much at odds about violence on film as we are with gun violence in the real world.\n\nIt is not just the violence, critics don\u2019t like. They\u2019ve also labeled the film as xenophobic\u2014all the bad guys are Mexican.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: the critics have a point. Last Blood is a formulaic mess of cardboard characters and messy body parts.\n\nStill, the reaction to the film, as much as the film itself, says a lot about contemporary America and how we see our place on the planet. Americans are conflicted over our national identity, our purpose and our actions. Are we a wellspring of violence and hate or a beacon of liberty?\n\nThe border, the battleground in Last Blood, is a case on point. Not long ago support for the border wall was bipartisan. Now if Trump is for it, his partisan opponents are against it. The wall is hailed as a savior of our sovereignty. The wall is decried as a human rights atrocity.\n\nAmerica moviegoers are as conflicted as their politicians. We have different heroes. We have different heels. We don\u2019t know what we want from Rambo anymore. Perhaps, that\u2019s why Stallone and his film struggled and failed to give us one we would all like.", "description": "Last week the latest last Rambo film hit the screen.
