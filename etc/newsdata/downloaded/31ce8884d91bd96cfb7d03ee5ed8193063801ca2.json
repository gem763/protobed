The Browns are slated to play the New York Jets next Monday night.\n\n\"If anybody else would've worn the watch, if it was a $20 watch, it wouldn't have been no problem,\" Beckham told reporters on Tuesday. \"That's just my life. If it ain't this, it's something else. If it wasn't the watch, it would've been the way I'd tied my shoes.\"\n\nThe NFL contacted Browns officials on Monday after Beckham was spotted wearing Richard Mille\u2019s limited-edition RM 11-03 McLaren watch on the field during Cleveland\u2019s 43-13 loss to the Tennessee Titans on Sunday. While Beckham wasn\u2019t fined for wearing the watch, the league informed the team that it has a policy barring players from bringing \u201chard objects\u201d onto the field.\n\nBeckham added that the watch didn\u2019t violate NFL guidelines on hard objects because it is made of plastic, noting that some players wear knee braces \u201cmade out of metal and you don\u2019t see them taping it up, no jewelry on, so I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn NFL spokesperson declined further comment on the situation. The league has no rule against players wearing jewelry on the field.\n\nBeckham appeared to address the NFL\u2019s reaction to his watch on social media on Monday.\n\nRichard Mille produced about 500 RM 11-03 watches. The watches sell for $190,000 at retail, but list at much higher prices on the secondary market.\n\nA company spokesperson said Beckham wasn\u2019t paid to wear the watch on the field and isn\u2019t a brand ambassador. Beckham bought the watch at a Richard Mille store.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\"If anybody else would've worn the watch, if it was a $20 watch, it wouldn't have been no problem,\" Beckham told reporters on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/OBJ-watch-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
