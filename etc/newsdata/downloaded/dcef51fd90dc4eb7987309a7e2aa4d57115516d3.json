Miller faces an additional six months in prison if convicted on that charge.\n\nThe teen's biological mother no longer has custody, Crall said. Katrina Miller had adopted the boy. A 3-year-old child also lived in the home.\n\n\"Normally, you don't think of kidnapping as involving someone's own child,\" Crall said, explaining the charges. \"But when you knowingly restrain the liberty of another person for the purpose of terrorizing or to inflict serious physical harm \u2013 that's what happened in this situation. That's what we're alleging; that we was kept there, he had attempted to flee once before, he was fleeing when he was found, and he was emaciated to the point of having been terrorized, and to the point where he's going to be hospitalized for quite some time.\"\n\nThe felonious assault charge is for \"failing to provide nutrition,\" Crall said of the allegations. Normally, people don't think of an assault as being a failure to do something, but \"the statute and the interpretation of it does include omitting doing a duty ... which causes serious physical harm.\"\n\nThe third-degree felony count of child endangerment deals with abusing a child and causing serious physical harm; the second-degree count relates to torturing or cruelly abusing a child, Crall said.\n\nThe first-degree misdemeanor child endangerment charge concerns the 3-year-old child.\n\n\"The degree of harm was not as great,\" Crall said. \"The child was underweight, but not in need of hospitalization.\"\n\nAfter fleeing his home, the child was found by law enforcement at a Galion home where he had gone to seek help. The residents there called police, Crall said.\n\nThe teen was being home-schooled, he said.\n\n\"They did go to church,\" Crall said. \"The child was very self-conscious about the way he looked, and he would wear multiple sets of clothing to cover up the fact that he looked the way he did.\"\n\nThe teen was taken to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Crall said, and is expected to remain there for at least three to four weeks. He said the boy was being treated for failure to thrive, severe malnutrition and refeeding syndrome.\n\n\"It's when the body rejects food just because it's a foreign substance at that point,\" Crall explained. \"They're not used to it, so they have to re-introduce food to the child.\"\n\nAs an infant, the child had had leukemia or some other childhood cancer, Crall said, but had not received follow-up care in quite some time.\n\nThe Millers were arraigned Monday in Crawford County Common Pleas Court. Bond was set at $500,000 in both cases.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bucyrus Telegraph-Forum: Malnourished 13-year-old escapes from home in Ohio.
