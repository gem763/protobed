USA TODAY\n\nSamuel Adams is releasing a beer so strong that it is illegal in 15 states.\n\nThe beer, called Utopias, has 28% alcohol by volume (ABV) and began its limited release Tuesday in select beer and specialty stores.\n\nThis is the 11th edition of Utopias and only 77 wooden casks of it were brewed this year. The 2019 Utopias is a blend of earlier batches of Samuel Adams' extreme beers, a catalog dating back over 25 years.\n\n\"The ruby black, uncarbonated 2019 Utopias is reminiscent of a rich vintage Port or fine Sherry, challenging drinkers' expectations of beer while getting better with age: drinkers can enjoy a portion of Utopias now and save the rest for other occasions,\" according to a press release.\n\nThe beer was blended, aged and finished in barrel rooms in Samuel Adams' three breweries in Boston, Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania and Cincinnati.\n\nBoozy holiday countdown: Aldi and Kroger releasing wine Advent calendars in November, and Aldi has a beer one, too\n\nSweet collaboration: Beer meets chocolate in new Yuengling and Hershey's rich, chocolatey porter\n\nUtopias will be available at select specialty beer and liquor stores for a suggested retail price of $210 per bottle.\n\nSam Adams founder and brewer Jim Koch said in a statement that Utopias has been \"nothing short of a labor of love\" since it was first brewed.\n\n\"As brewers, we take pride in everything we make, but there's something special about putting such a unique, extreme beer in the hands of not only the craft beer community but our coworkers,\" Koch said. \"Involving new members of our team from Dogfish Head in the bottling process this year signified collaboration, progress and inspired future innovations that we can't wait to share.\"\n\nWhere can\u2019t you get Utopias?\n\nBecause of its high alcohol level, Utopias is not shipped to or sold in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont or West Virginia.\n\nFollow Briana Rice on Twitter: @BriRiceWrites.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2019/10/17/samuel-adams-releasing-utopias-beer-that-is-illegal-in-15-states/4014243002/", "description": "Samuel Adams is releasing a beer so strong that it is illegal in 15 states.
