Traders are pricing in more than a 97 percent chance of a reduction during the two-day meeting, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nAlthough the U.S. central bank probably won\u2019t fully close the door to further action, policymakers will likely put a \u201cspeed bump\u201d in their official statement to signal the mid-cycle correction, which began in July, is coming to an end, Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Mellon, told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cI think Fed officials want it to be three and done,\u201d Reinhart said, pointing to past comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nMNUCHIN OPEN TO LOOSER BANK LIQUIDITY RULES AFTER SEPTEMBER CASH CRUNCH\n\nIn remarks earlier this year, Powell seemingly raised comparisons to 1995-96 and 1998. In both instances, the U.S. central bank, under the leadership of Alan Greenspan, cut interest rates three times, successfully preserving the economic upswing.\n\nIn approving the previous cuts, Powell has cited fallout from the nearly 16-month long U.S.-China trade war, muted inflation and a stormy economic outlook. In the one-month period since the Federal Open Market Committee last met. However, President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have moved closer toward striking a partial trade deal that could be signed as soon as mid-November.\n\nBut given the precariousness of the situation \u2014 for instance, there\u2019s a possibility the trade agreement implodes like it did in May, when a near-deal crumbled at the last minute \u2014 \u201cJay Powell is in no way shape or form going to say he\u2019s done,\u201d Reinhart said.\n\nIf \"we\u2019re wrong about the politics, and the trade deal blows up, then the Fed will get back in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to understand the awkward position monetary policymakers are in at this meeting.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nEssentially, Powell has the tough job of threading the needle: He\u2019ll emphasize that economic growth is sluggish; inflation expectations have fallen some, but the Fed does not expect a recession, said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management.\n\n\u201cHe will likely indicate that the Fed will remain data-dependent and let the economic numbers be their guide,\u201d Donabedian said. \u201cPowell will continue to hear from others on the FOMC that further rate cuts risk sparking a speculative frenzy in the markets.\u201d\n\nThe Fed chairman is slated to speak at 2:30 p.m. ET, a half-hour after the statement is released.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Although the U.S. central bank probably won\u2019t fully close the door to further action, policymakers will likely put a \u201cspeed bump\u201d in their official statement.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Jerome-Powell-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
