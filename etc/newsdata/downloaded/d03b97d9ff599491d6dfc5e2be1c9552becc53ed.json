When Barack Obama became president, he first had to prevent a depression, but then he too turned to health care.\n\nThe next Democratic president should choose a different priority.\n\nIt\u2019s still true that too many Americans suffer from inadequate or expensive insurance coverage, and the next president should certainly look to make progress on health care. But presidents must make choices. Realistically, they have to pick one or two sweeping bills to try to push through Congress in their first year.\n\nTo argue that health care should be atop the list, you can\u2019t simply say that it is important. You need to believe that it\u2019s so much more important than everything else \u2014 climate change, voting rights, immigration, education, wage stagnation, the unfair tax system \u2014 that health care deserves to be the Democrats\u2019 only top priority over four decades of presidencies. All those other issues would once again take a back seat.\n\nAnd that would be a mistake, because the both moral and political case for some other issues is now stronger than it is for health care.", "description": "The 2020 campaign is obsessed with the wrong issue.", "authors": ["David Leonhardt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/opinion/27Leonhardt/27Leonhardt-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
