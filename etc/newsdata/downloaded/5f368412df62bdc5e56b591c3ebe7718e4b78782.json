That New England had 12 more first downs, 222 more yards and sacked Colt McCoy \u2013 his third quarterback this season \u2013 five times for a total of 43 yards?\n\nHe didn\u2019t need to look at any paper to understand the Redskins are 0-5, that the stands in the stadium above him were filled with Patriots fans who chanted \u201cBrady! Brady! Brady!\u201d throughout the fourth quarter. About 200 feet away, owner Daniel Snyder and team president Bruce Allen were leaving the stadium in a fleet of black limousines and SUVs. It seemed that his job had been spared, at least for the night. But in that corridor nothing seemed certain anymore.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf the key works on Monday, I\u2019ll keep working,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nProvided his office locks have not been changed before sunrise Monday, when Gruden likes to get to his desk, he will have yet another fiasco glowing from his computer screen. He will see more missed passes, more offensive drives killed by penalties, more defensive stops wiped away with the officials\u2019 drop of a yellow flag. He will see a team whose players insist they are much, much better than 0-5, but playing like an 0-5 team.\n\nAnd he will have to figure out a way to stop it.\n\n\u201cAt this time of year you aren\u2019t going to install a new defense or a new offense, with all the new [players] we have around here and some of the injuries we have piling up,\u201d Gruden said, when asked after the game if he was going to fire any of his assistant coaches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThree takeaways from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to Patriots\n\nBut inside the locker room, his most famous player was suggesting just that \u2014 and more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that something has to change,\u201d future Hall of Fame running back Adrian Peterson said, his frustration mounting. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing you do know, because we are 0-5. We haven\u2019t won. We haven\u2019t been productive as an offense.\n\n\u201cYou got to go back to the drawing board and say, \u2018okay, as a coaching staff ... what can we do better to put our players in better position to be productive as an offense, to be better as a defense?\u2019\u201d Peterson continued. \u201cIt\u2019s their job to do that. We 0-5. What we\u2019ve been doing, obviously, isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nA few things did work early for the Redskins. Rookie wide receiver Steven Sims took a first quarter handoff, cut around the right edge of the line, ducked two tackles and ran 65 yards down the sideline for a touchdown that put Washington up 7-0. And for the first half, the Redskins held in, allowing just a touchdown and two field goals, going into the locker room at halftime down just 12-7.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut as has happened again and again this season, the Redskins folded in the second half. The Patriots thundered back, rumbling over Washington\u2019s defense for three touchdowns in four possessions on drives that went 75, 88 and 45 yards. The Patriots fans who filled the stands howled with delight at the team\u2019s 5-0 start.\n\n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Brady later said of the sea of New England white and blue. \u201cThat felt like a home game.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Redskins\u2019 offense sputtered. It ran just 27 plays in the second half. No possession went longer than six plays. At one point, left tackle Donald Penn turned to one of the officials to whom the offensive linemen had been complaining about penalty calls and said: \u201cYou can\u2019t be mad at us, we\u2019re just frustrated. It\u2019s built up for weeks.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSurprisingly, the official seemed to understand, Penn said later. The same couldn\u2019t be said for the Redskins fans who did come to the game. Around the time Patriots Coach Bill Belichick replaced Brady in the fourth quarter -- the way a college coach would replace his starter in a blowout over a lower-tier opponent -- those clad in Redskins jerseys headed up the stairs, leaving their home stadium to New England.\n\nAD\n\nSoon, Washington\u2019s players were trudging off the field in much the same way, shoulders slouched, faces filled with shock.\n\n\u201cThey showed a lot of exotic stuff on film,\u201d Peterson said of the Patriots defense. \u201cBut against us, they didn\u2019t really. You know? It was like, \u2018hey, we\u2019ll sit back here and see what you guys do, allow you guys to mess up.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWith Snyder gone and no need to stay at the scene of another football bloodbath, Gruden put on a sport jacket and tie, walked out of the locker room, got into a SUV and left the stadium \u2014 apparently hopeful that back at his office in Virginia, his key will still work and the game film that awaits will provide some answers to the weekly disasters that keep coming.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nThe key moments from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to the Patriots\n\nEven Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 how many Patriots fans were at FedEx Field\n\nAD", "description": "Washington\u2019s head coach says \u201cIf the key works on Monday, I\u2019ll keep working,\u201d after 33-7 defeat, while Adrian Peterson says, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that something has to change.\u201d", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QOc0Wg81dCvkzpDbkZyPfTkwl_c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SPKMZYXIPUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
