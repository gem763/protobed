Not just the UFC, the world. And the one thing I can remember and take away from that time was his focus. He was so focused. He decided what he wanted, and he said stuff, he pointed at this guy, he reached for the stars, he reached for the moon, and he made it happen. Magical.\u201d\n\nMcGregor defeated Holloway via unanimous decision in 2013 in what was only McGregor\u2019s second UFC fight; Holloway was just 22 at the time. In a recent interview with ESPN, McGregor took several jabs at Holloway and said he\u2019d be willing to fight him, as well as Frankie Edgar and a few others.\n\nBut Holloway doesn\u2019t believe McGregor, who\u2019s only competed in MMA once in almost 3 years, even knows what he wants next.\n\n\u201cListening to him now, I don\u2019t see that same focus,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going after everything, you\u2019re not focused on anything. He called out like 20 guys in that interview.\u201d\n\nHolloway attempted to capture the interim lightweight title earlier this year but fell short to Dustin Poirier at UFC 236. It\u2019s no secret that his cut down to featherweight is tough, but Holloway, who recently notched his second title defense in a win over Edgar, is still very much focused on 145-pounds.\n\nHe takes on Alexander Volkanovski at UFC 245 on Dec. 14 and should he cross paths with McGregor in the future, he wants to compete with the best version of him possible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in competing with him if he\u2019s not at his best,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t seem healthy, and he doesn\u2019t sound right. If he comes back and he says, \u2018Hey, I beat Max when he was a kid, but I want to beat him in his prime to prove that I\u2019m the best ever,\u2019 then yeah I want the champ. I want that champ. I want that 2015-2016 champ. That mentality and that focus, and right now it\u2019s just not interesting to me.\n\n\u201cI want to fight the best Conor McGregor. So he can go figure things out, and he can let us know.\u201d", "description": "Max Holloway would only want to fight Conor McGregor again if he's focused and at his best: \"I want that 2015-2016 champ.\"", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Brian Garcia", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/max-holloway-conor-mcgregor-ufc-fight-night-26-weigh-ins.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
