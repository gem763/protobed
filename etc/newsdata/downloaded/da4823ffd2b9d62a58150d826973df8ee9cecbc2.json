Try saying nothing | David Shariatmadari", "language": "en", "text": "Everyone wants to sound fluent. To speak in fully formed sentences, without gaps, as though they know what they are talking about. Anxiety over stumbling or tying yourself in knots trying to find the right words \u2013 a condition called glossophobia \u2013 puts many people off public speaking entirely. But linguists may now be able to offer a crumb of consolation to nervous speakers.\n\nHesitating, even for as little as 300 milliseconds, can change how your audience perceives you \u2013 and in a surprisingly positive way. A study in the journal Lingua has found that speech that contains \u201cunfilled pauses\u201d \u2013 noticeable silences between words that don\u2019t have anything to do with punctuation \u2013 is judged more \u201carticulate\u201d and \u201ceducated\u201d than speech without gaps. In short, we may finally have proof of what Ronan Keating told us two decades ago: you say it best when you say nothing at all.\n\nThere is a downside: these same speakers are also thought of as less \u201cauthoritative\u201d and \u201cconfident\u201d. The paper\u2019s author suggests that listeners believe unfilled pauses indicate that someone is thinking carefully about what they\u2019re saying \u2013 and as a result, they assume that the person is more intelligent. Conversely, he says: \u201cThose who think and deliberate may not be regarded as assertive.\u201d This is backed up by earlier work showing that unfilled pauses are seen as less relaxed. But what you lose in swagger, you make up for in intellectual appeal.\n\nAlthough the study did not compare silences with so-called filled pauses \u2013 the \u201cums\u201d and \u201cers\u201d that pepper so much of our speech \u2013 it may be worth trying to keep them to a minimum. Previous research has found that speakers with high \u201cum\u201d rates are judged \u201cless credible\u201d, \u201cless truthful\u201d and \u201cless competent\u201d. On the other hand, filled pauses are not totally useless. There is evidence that they alert listeners to the fact that something complex or difficult is coming up. If your priority is sounding smart, however, do not be tempted to stuff your silences with meaningless syllables.\n\nThe lesson seems to be that, if you need thinking time, you should not be scared to just take it. A mini-hiatus is not going to make you seem stupid, or incapable of expressing yourself properly. It could have quite the opposite effect. After all, as a sage once said: \u201cHe who knows, does not speak.\u201d\n\nDavid Shariatmadari is the author of Don\u2019t Believe a Word: The Surprising Truth About Language", "description": "New research shows that so-called \u2018unfilled pauses\u2019 during speech can make you sound more intelligent, says Guardian writer and editor David Shariatmadari", "authors": ["David Shariatmadari"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0000da166420cd420f9a5c23aca8b8b6588aeb41/1240_1306_3843_2306/master/3843.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64bb696e8200c6d64b398418dc80c00e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
