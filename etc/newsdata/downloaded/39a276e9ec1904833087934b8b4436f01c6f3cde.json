Fiji really came out of the blocks at us, aggressive, they\u2019re really big, physical guys, they really took it to us,\u201d Australia captain Michael Hooper said.\n\n\u201cReally proud of our guys, to regroup, to work our set piece into the game, and that really paid off for us.\u201d\n\nThe Fijians had been tipped to be a real threat to the Wallabies with a big and fast pack and an explosive backline and while they promised to be more disciplined and patient it was obvious they wanted to play at pace.\n\nThey established an early 8-0 lead through Ben Volavola\u2019s first of three penalties and a typical counter-attacking exploitation of space with Yato put over in the corner after winger Josua Tuisova broke two tackles.\n\nAfter initially trying to match the Fijians with width at pace, Australia\u2019s forwards began to build into the game and put pressure on the scrum, with one shunt in the Fijian 22-metre area allowing Hooper to get driven over the tryline.\n\nVolavola, however, managed to extend the lead to 14-7 with two more penalties before Reece Hodge reduced the deficit at halftime to 14-12 when he crossed after the Wallabies created space out wide following an attacking lineout.\n\nNayacalevu then extended the lead to nine points early in the second half when he pounced on a loose ball in midfield and was mobbed by his team\u2019s replacements warming up behind the tryline.\n\nStaring at a possible defeat that could have cost them a place in the knockout phases, the Wallabies went back to basics with the introduction of Genia and big loose forward Lukhan Salakaia-Loto changing the momentum of the game.\n\nThey won a succession of penalties inside Fiji\u2019s half that led to Latu finishing off driving mauls from attacking lineouts, before simple tries for Kerevi and Koroibete blew the scoreline out.\n\n\u201cIt was a disappointing result at the end but I thought we played really well in the first half,\u201d Fiji captain Dominiko Waqaniburotu said.\n\n\u201cJust a lot of things we need to work on, like the discipline, which cost us a man in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe did a bit well but we need to improve if we want to compete in this competition.\u201d\n\nAustralia, who also opened their 2015 World Cup campaign by beating Fiji in Cardiff, next play Wales in Tokyo on Sept. 29 while Fiji meet Uruguay on Wednesday.", "description": "Twice champions Australia were forced to abandon a wide game plan and resort to controlled possession as they survived an almighty scare in their World Cup Pool D opener against Fiji on Saturday to run out 39-21 winners at the Sapporo Dome.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432283517&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K074-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
