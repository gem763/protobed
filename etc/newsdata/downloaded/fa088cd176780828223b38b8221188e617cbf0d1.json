TMZ reported Brown \u201clooking sad\u201d as he touched down in Miami. CBS pondered \u201cwhy the Patriots could be in trouble if things get any worse\u201d. Iterations of \u201cBrown out. What now?\u201d sprouted up innumerably across the web. Brown, for his part, tweeted eight similar \u201cthank you\u201d messages to the Patriots for the opportunity and a \u201cJust got fired on Friday\u201d with a facepalm emoji. A sizable chunk of the thousands of comments in response to his posts invoked God and prayer for Brown\u2019s resolve to stay strong and keep fighting. He capped off his thread with a photo sitting on the hood of a Rolls Royce in front of a private jet, with the caption: Beat the odds.\n\nBrown will not face criminal charges for the accusations leading to his dismissal, including most notably one of rape in a civil lawsuit by his former trainer, Britney Taylor (Brown has denied the allegations). He took again to Twitter on Sunday morning to answer the headlines\u2019 musings himself. He said he was quitting the NFL and took shots at Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his former teammate Ben Roethlisberger. Earlier this week, Taylor spent 10 hours in discussion with the NFL investigation team going over her lawsuit. Her social media profiles have been wiped clean.\n\nAntonio Brown quits NFL, and references Kraft massage parlor charges Read more\n\nThis Friday will mark the one-year anniversary of Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford testifying before Congress about the sexual misconduct of then-nominee, now-sitting associate justice of the US supreme court, Brett Kavanaugh, when they were both in high school.\n\nMuch of the current related media coverage is Kavanaugh-centered \u2013 on the fallout from the publication of The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, the New York Times\u2019 woeful lapse in judgement when describing a second accuser, the ensuing correction, the President\u2019s defense of Kavanaugh \u2013 the list goes on. Part of what has been lost in the swirl of this news cycle is the notion that through the act of testifying, Ford offered a platform to even have these kinds of conversations. The problem is, she hasn\u2019t been included in any of them. The conversations happening now, one year after her coming forward and more than 30 years after the alleged assault, have to do with the man she accused: his actions, his character, his politics, his career.\n\nI watched Ford\u2019s testimony on my laptop at work. Watching her face, her movements \u2013 this wasn\u2019t the testimony of an emboldened, empowered woman. This wasn\u2019t a warrior, a fighter, or any of the other trite stereotypes used to label women advocating for themselves. This was a professional woman, uncomfortable and subject to profound misinterpretation and condemnation on a very public stage, who was coming forward anyway.\n\nOne of the problems with conversations around sexual misconduct, and abuse, is that we tend to oversimplify the takeaways. We compress the narratives to soundbites: Did it happen or not? Can you remember every precise detail? Yes or no? It is stripped of the painfully complicated nuances it entails, of the deep ambivalences, ambiguities and contradictory feelings that can result when the assailant is a known acquaintance. We don\u2019t have enough of a safety net in place for these kinds of discussions to unfold post-disclosure, to cushion the aftershock of ongoing criticism and doubt. The alleged victim appears, discloses and is chased out of the public eye in a cloud of Twitter outrage. The news cycle and our attention moves on.\n\nFor now, Brown remains in limbo under ongoing NFL investigation. But there is a sense of process taking place, legal formalities that will help his story move forward. What is unclear is whether these events will yield a wider cultural understanding of how to care for victims after the disclosure, or whether the headlines will peak, fizzle and dry out. Today, it is still Brown\u2019s future we\u2019re waiting to hear about, not Taylor\u2019s.", "description": "The conversations around the NFL star\u2019s release have all centered on his future.
