It follows another gang-related murder in King County, Washington, that also involved an illegal immigrant that authorities refused to turn over to ICE.\n\nBoth killings stemmed from gang beefs, with insults and challenges being traded on Snapchat accounts, leading to fistfights.\n\nProsecutors say Mr. Iraheta-Vega and Mr. Garcia-Hernandez brought the bat and machete to their fight, planning all along to kill Juan Carlos. Both men admitted their role in the slaying to detectives, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cThe defendants beat the victim with a baseball bat and mercilessly chopped his neck repeatedly with a machete before dismembering the body,\u201d prosecuting attorney Mary H. Barbosa told a judge. \u201cThe extraordinary brutality of this crime demonstrates the threat the defendants pose to the community.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the killings, King County officials have defended their policies and complained that ICE, by pointing out the connection between the sanctuary policies and the murders, is harassing the county.\n\nKing County Executive Dow Constantine said ICE was \u201cseeking to sow fear and division\u201d by revealing the immigration histories of the murder suspects.\n\nHe said he\u2019s seen studies that show no correlation between illegal immigration and crime.\n\nBut Homeland Security officials say statistics are irrelevant to these cases, where there\u2019s concrete proof that if the local authorities had cooperated, crimes could have been prevented.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about literally crimes that never should have happened in this country because they\u2019re people who, upon their first interaction with the justice system, should have been deported,\u201d acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli told reporters this week.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
