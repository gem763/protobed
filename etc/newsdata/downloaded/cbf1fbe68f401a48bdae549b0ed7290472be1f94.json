For those, politicians might deserve a degree of sympathy as they deal with the consequences. By contrast, other catastrophes are so well-telegraphed and can be observed approaching from such a distance, the klaxon sound of warnings deadening the ears, that only the most insensitive or incompetent, or both, of politicians could fail to see the danger.\n\nSuch a figure is our new-ish home secretary, Priti Patel, whose first act in office was to airily declare that freedom of movement for EU citizens would end on 31 October \u2013 a policy so unworkable that she had to execute a U-turn on it a fortnight later. It was not a helpful episode, and the system remains confused, and especially so if the no-deal scenario actually does transpire, either on 31 October or later.\n\nThe latest warnings about this absurd state of affairs emanate from the European parliament. Using a politically charged phrase that must have been deliberately chosen, MEPs from across the political spectrum say that the British government\u2019s various announcements about future migration rules \u201cmay exacerbate the hostile environment\u201d towards EU citizens resident in the UK, \u201cas well as impacting negatively on their ability to enforce their rights\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe safety, security and rights of EU citizens in the UK, and those of their families, remain unclear. Many, including the notable Eurosceptic MEP Daniel Hannan, have cautioned that the government\u2019s approach risks delivering a \u201cnew Windrush\u201d scandal, on top of all of its other problems. And there are many appalling documented cases of people from what is now the EU, many of whom came to the UK years before this country even joined the then European Economic Communities in 1973, being faced with a bureaucratic nightmare even to be allowed \u201csettled status\u201d. It is not enough, apparently, for them to be able to produce a passport, or ID card for their own country, nor a reference to the electoral register (they can vote in local elections), nor a national insurance number or a current British driving licence.\n\nFor those who have arrived much more recently, some who may have moved house and whose English may not be as fluent, the problems involved in assembling the requisite paperwork and going through the approval process are even less straightforward. It can be a humiliating and unfathomable exercise, as well as an unjust one.\n\nFar too many EU citizens who ask for settled status are instead being offered \u201cpre-settled\u201d status, which adds an unwanted uncertainty and a perceived slight to their application. Some 42 per cent receive this response, including many who have been here for decades, have built up businesses or otherwise contrived to society. Those who work in warehouses or on farms, though, have just as much right to be recognised and accommodated as, say, surgeons, academics or premier league football managers.\n\nBritain is letting these people down, and wasting the opportunity to retain them and their loyalty. Even though the scheduled deadline for settled status doesn\u2019t expire until 2020, that may change if, after a no-deal Brexit, negotiations about reciprocal rights become fraught. Boris Johnson has pledged to make a unilateral guarantee about rights, but the legislation is yet to become law. It might help if parliament were still sitting\u2026\n\nThe old, routine attitude of the British government towards a hostile report from the European parliament was to safely ignore it. That, though, was in the days when the UK was a member state, and not a putative third country. If, and when, a UK-EU free trade deal or a post-Brexit withdrawal agreement does need to be ratified, it will require the assent of more than 30 parliaments and assemblies across the EU \u2013 including the European parliament. There are also 1.3 million British citizens living in Spain, France, Cyprus and elsewhere, and, under a no-deal Brexit, those retired, living, working, studying or travelling in the EU will lose rights to access a range of services. If EU citizens in the UK are treated shabbily, then some in Europe will wonder why they should behave any differently.\n\nThe answer, as the European parliament suggests, is to upturn the burden of proof, and to allow free registration for settled status, with the minimum of documentary evidence, which would only be refused or downgraded if the British authorities could prove that the case for settled status was flawed.\n\nAccording to the most recent polling, attitudes in Britain towards EU migration have softened, ironically since the EU referendum. The much better informed debate about the contribution to the economy, public services and society that EU citizens make has developed and educated the wider electorate. The slow learners in this case appear to be sitting in cabinet. Time for another rethink for Ms Patel, before she repeats the mistakes that Theresa May and Amber Rudd made before her.", "description": "Sometimes political disasters arrive out of a clear blue sky.
