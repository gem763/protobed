Film sets are often packed, demanding, and tiring.\n\nIt\u2019s only in the last few years that a specified role to guide and coach actors for love scenes has become mainstream.\n\nIntimacy coordinator Ita O\u2019Brien worked on Netflix\u2019s \u201cSex Education,\u201d as well as HBO\u2019s \u201cWatchmen.\u201d\n\nWe attended one of Ita\u2019s workshops in South London.\n\nVisit Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nRanging from the cordial, to the steamy, to the\u2026 er, bestial, love scenes feature in films to advance the relationship between certain characters. Some films intentionally feature dodgy intercourse to invoke humour. In this, sex is depicted as corny or crass.\n\nBut for the genuinely romantic depictions, actors and directors can face a myriad of challenges. Film sets are often packed, demanding, and tiring. A far cry from the sexy mood you see on screen.\n\nMoviegoers generally accept that the first ever on-camera orgasm in a non-pornographic film was in the 1933 Czech film \u201cEcstasy,\u201d a romantic drama starring Hedy Lamarr.\n\nBut it\u2019s only in the last few years that a specified role to guide and coach actors for love scenes has become mainstream. One such Intimacy coordinator is Ita O\u2019Brien, who worked on Netflix\u2019s \u201cSex Education,\u201d as well as HBO\u2019s \u201cWatchmen.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cSex Education,\u201d Ita worked closely with the young cast to bring about authentic storytelling as well as keeping the actors safe on set. A scene is broken down into individual movements, with permission sought at each level.\n\nAnd actors do need protecting. Maria Schneider accused director Bernardo Bertolucci of emotionally assaulting her by insisting on a now-infamous rape scene in 1972\u2019s \u201cLast Tango In Paris.\u201d Salma Hayek accused controversial producer Harvey Weinstein of forcing her to perform a nude scene in \u201cFrida.\u201d\n\nCoordinators like Ita have introduced a few practices to prevent incidents like this from happening. These include hiring a more gender-inclusive crew and encouraging crew members from different areas of production to get involved in an intimacy workshop.\n\nFor scenes that require nudity, female actors can wear a merkin, which is an artificial cover for pubic hair. In an interview with Allure magazine, Kate Winslet said producers made her one for her Oscar-winning turn in 2008\u2019s \u201cThe Reader.\u201d\n\nNipple pasties can be worn to cover breasts. Depending on how much skin is being shown, some actors may choose to wear flesh-coloured underwear.\n\nPractical effects can also assist scenes. If two people can\u2019t keep their hands off each other, why not add in a little thunder and lightning, or get them soaked in the rain?\n\nGlycerin spray, oil, or water can be added to actors\u2019 skin to give them that \u201csweaty\u201d look.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the more extreme augmentation. Visual effects have been used to superimpose actors heads on porn actors\u2019 bodies. In Lars Von Trier\u2019s \u201cNymphomaniac,\u201d actors\u2019 faces were superimposed on porn performers\u2019 bodies using CGI.\n\nWe joined Ita at a workshop in south London.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
