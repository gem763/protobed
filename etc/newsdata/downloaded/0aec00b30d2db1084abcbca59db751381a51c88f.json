The previous record was almost eight years.\n\n\u201cMISSION ACHIEVED! says @nimsdai from the summit of #Shishapangma,\u201d read the post on Purja\u2019s Facebook page, referring to the final peak in China.\n\nPolish climber Jerzy Kukuczka completed the same feat after seven years, 11 months and 14 days in 1987 after Italy\u2019s legendary Reinhold Messner became the first to scale the 14 peaks a year earlier.\n\nSouth Korean Kim Chang-ho completed the challenge one month slower than Kukuczka \u2014 although unlike Kukuczka, who died in a climbing accident in 1989, he never used supplementary oxygen.\n\nThe 36-year-old Purja, a former member of the Gurkhas \u2014 a unit of Nepalis recruited into the British army \u2014 as well as the elite Special Boat Service, kicked off his ambitious \u201cProject Possible\u201d in April.\n\nIn the first part of his record attempt, Purja climbed Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Kanchenjunga, Everest, Lhotse and Makalu \u2014 among the highest of the \u201c8000ers\u201d \u2014 in just one month.\n\nA month later, he headed to Pakistan for the second part, where he first tackled the notorious Nanga Parbat at 8,125 metres.\n\nBattling sleep deprivation to meet his target, Purja said he was almost sprinting up and down five of Pakistan\u2019s highest peaks including Gasherbrum I, Gasherbrum II and K2, the second tallest in the world.\n\nTwenty-three days later he was standing atop Broad Peak, his fifth and final mountain of the second phase.\n\nPurja began his final push in September, reaching the tops of Cho Oyu and Manaslu within a week.\n\nWhen he first told others about his new quest, \u201ceveryone was laughing at me and saying \u2018how it will be possible\u2019?\u201d Purja told AFP in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cIt is about trusting your ability,\u201d he had said as he relaxed in Kathmandu waiting to ascend the final peak.\n\n\u201cYou always need to have (a) positive mindset because sometimes things will go wrong.\u201d\n\nHe also said that he wanted to use his feats to inspire the next generation of Nepali climbers to break his records.\n\nSherpas \u2014 Nepalis who often work as guides for foreign mountaineers \u2014 are the backbone of the country\u2019s lucrative climbing industry, but don\u2019t attract as much attention or accolades as their international companions.\n\n\u201cNepal is home to the highest peaks in the world. There are so much better climbers out there who (haven\u2019t) got the opportunity,\u201d he told AFP in Kathmandu.", "description": "Kathmandu (AFP) \u2013 A Nepali mountaineer on Tuesday smashed the record for summiting the world\u2019s 14 highest peaks, racing up all", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/1e5318_nirmal-purja-completed-climb-14-mountains-all-000-metres-26-250-feet-in-months-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
