She was later taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition.\n\n\u201cWhen he walked into that neighbor\u2019s apartment, there were four people at the table eating dinner,\u201d said First Deputy Superintendent Anthony Riccio. \u201cFor reasons we don\u2019t yet know, he opened fire and killed them.\u201d\n\nRiccio said all of the victims knew the suspect and noted that the residents claimed he had \u201canger management issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what set him off tonight. Most of the occupants inside the building have had problems with him in the past, but certainly nothing of this magnitude,\u201d Riccio commented.\n\nReports said once the suspect was taken into custody, police recovered a weapon at the scene of the shooting.\n\nOn Saturday night, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called the event \u201cdevastating\u201d and said incidents like it were happening too often:\n\nToday\u2019s mass shooting at a condo building on W. Irving Park is devastating and almost unfathomable, except it is happening way too frequently\u2014not only here, but across our country. \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 13, 2019\n\n\u201cWe mourn the loss, honor the victims, and continue the hard but necessary work of keeping our neighborhoods safe, and taking guns out of the hands of those who are mentally infirm,\u201d she wrote in another tweet on Saturday.\n\nHowever, Breitbart News reported on July 16 that Illinois State Rep. La Shawn Ford (D-Chicago) said he was urging Chicago residents to arm themselves after 41 people were shot between July 12 and 14. Nine of the 41 victims died from their wounds.\n\nFord also said that during one of the shootings, bullets struck his own vehicle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working with a concealed carry instructor and we\u2019re going to go through the neighborhood and we\u2019re going to encourage people to get their concealed carry license because it makes no sense for people not to have the protections that they need,\u201d Ford told WLS-AM 890 News.", "description": "A suspect in Chicago allegedly shot and killed four of his neighbors as they ate dinner on Saturday evening on the city's Northwest Side.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Deadly-Shooting-Chicago-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
