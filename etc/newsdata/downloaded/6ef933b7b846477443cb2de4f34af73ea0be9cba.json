Tracy is now in her 30s and with a daughter of her own. Wilson says that talking to some real-life care leavers about Tracy helped her to see her famous character from a new perspective.\n\nHow Tracy Beaker turned out: Jacqueline Wilson on the return of her most famous creation Read more\n\n\u201cThey thought that Tracy should be much more of an aspirational character as an adult. And they wanted her to be ultra-successful and confident, so that young people in care might think: right, if she can do this, I can do this,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cSome of the group I met had done very well for themselves. They were bothered by the average person\u2019s perception of a care leaver.\u201d\n\nShe understood their point. In My Mum Tracy Beaker, published last year, grownup Tracy was an unemployed single mum, living on a rundown London council estate. Wilson, now 73, grew up on a London council estate herself and raised her own daughter almost single-handedly. She had never thought that she could be perpetuating a negative stereotype about care leavers.\n\n\u201cI listened very carefully,\u201d she says, and she decided to take on board what they had said. She asked some of them to give her feedback on the manuscript for her next book. \u201cI felt I owed it to these young people to see what they thought.\u201d She then incorporated many of the small changes they suggested into the final text for We Are the Beaker Girls, published next week and dedicated to the young people Wilson met.\n\nAshley Cameron, 29, is one of them. She was first taken into care at the age of three and she says she can easily imagine her unhappy younger self \u201cclimbing the walls with excitement\u201d about the dedication. \u201cI binge-read Jacqueline Wilson\u2019s books growing up. I was in a pretty tough foster home at the time, and I saw a lot of myself in Tracy because I had a lot of behavioural issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad \u2013 and thankful \u2013 that Jacqueline\u2019s had another look at Tracy and has come up with the book that she has,\u201d she explains. \u201cI know \u2018happy ever after\u2019 doesn\u2019t always happen. But it\u2019s just about providing that little bit of hope and inspiration for these kids who are in care now.\u201d\n\nIn Wilson\u2019s new book, Tracy and her 10-year-old daughter Jess (the narrator of the story) are living in a new home by the seaside. Tracy is busy running a successful antique shop and being a loving mother when a runaway foster child tears off with Jess\u2019s ice cream. And you just know their lives will never be the same again. By the end of the book, Tracy is contemplating becoming a foster carer to this child, whose name is Jordan. \u201cI was very interested in the idea that Tracy herself might consider fostering,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cI think if children have been through the care system and out the other side, sometimes that does happen.\u201d\n\nShe also hopes the book might shine a light on the plight of runaway children who are in care. \u201cThey do often disappear for days at a time. It\u2019s frightening to think what might have happened to Jordan in real life \u2013 if Jess and Tracy hadn\u2019t come along.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Fostering Network, more than 65,000 children are being fostered and a further 8,600 foster families are needed in the next 12 months alone.\n\nWilson deliberately chose to portray, in Jordan, a teenager whose previous foster placements hadn\u2019t worked out. She only hints vaguely at what has happened to Jordan in the past, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t sound as if it were great\u201d. She felt that a difficult child who has been repeatedly let down by others wouldn\u2019t deter Tracy. \u201cAnd I thought a child like that would be the way to Tracy\u2019s heart.\u201d\n\nMy parents at war: Jacqueline Wilson opens up about unhappy early life Read more\n\nThe entire book is a homage to the work of foster carers. \u201cThere are easier ways to earn your living. And yet there\u2019s very few ways that give so much back,\u201d says Wilson. She also feels a lot of empathy for social workers: \u201cIt must be heartbreaking for the social workers who have to decide whether or not to take a child away from their family.\u201d\n\nShe hopes all the children who read her books will gain an insight into what it\u2019s like to be a foster child. \u201cChildren can be so compassionate but I think some children need it explained \u2013 in not too bossy a way \u2013 that a child doesn\u2019t choose to look a bit unloved or to suddenly arrive in school, halfway through a term, without their mum and dad.\u201d\n\nShe says of her latest book, \u201cI think my biggest motivation was to prove that Tracy would be a good mum.\u201d Wilson knows firsthand that if you don\u2019t experience good parenting, \u201cyou\u2019ve actually got to be a very strong person to work your way around it\u201d. Her own parents were \u201cnot cut out to be parents\u201d, she says: she has talked about being scared of her father\u2019s temper and having a difficult relationship with her mother who would emotionally blackmail her. \u201cI was determined not to be that sort of mother to my daughter.\u201d\n\nShe wants children to see what an attentive, capable and loving mother Tracy is and to realise: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be stuck in whatever groove all your family were in. You can always think, well, I\u2019m going to do things differently.\u201d\n\nWilson, a former children\u2019s laureate, acknowledges that although the representation of foster children in children\u2019s fiction has improved since she wrote her first Tracy Beaker story 28 years ago, there is still a problem. \u201cI think publishers are trying very, very hard to get a huge variety of characters with different backgrounds in their books. It\u2019s just a bit of a slow process.\u201d\n\nIf more care leavers became novelists, that might help, she says. She would love it if foster children and care leavers read her books and felt inspired to become writers themselves. Wilson says: \u201cI think that would be splendid.\u201d\n\nWe Are the Beaker Girls, by Jacqueline Wilson is published on 17 October\n\nCurriculum vitae\n\nAge: 73.\n\nFamily: Divorced, one daughter.\n\nEducation: Coombe girls school, New Malden, south London.
