It had lowered its indicated price range earlier in the day in a futile bid to salvage it.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, Endeavor had been in talks with investors to price its IPO just below its original $30 to $32 target range, according a person familiar with the matter.\n\nHowever, market demand softened further in light of the first-day trading of fitness startup Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O), whose shares closed down 11.2% on Thursday following the pricing of its IPO on Wednesday.\n\nEndeavor will revisit plans for an IPO in 2020 if market conditions improve, the source added, requesting anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.\n\nEndeavor\u2019s businesses run the gamut from talent agency WME, which represents the likes of actor Dwayne Johnson, to mixed martial arts promotion company Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n\nThe company shares several characteristics with other IPOs that have struggled this year, such as a history of losses, a share structure giving top management operational control, and a heavy debt burden.\n\nEndeavor\u2019s first-half net losses narrowed year-on-year to $192.6 million from $404.5 million. It reported a full-year profit in 2018 after losses in 2016 and 2017. In the first six months of 2019, revenue grew to $2.05 billion from $1.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nFollowing a string of acquisitions in recent years, Endeavor\u2019s long-term debt at the end of June totaled $4.6 billion.\n\nEmanuel, along with Chairman Patrick Whitesell and investor Silver Lake Partners, would have retained the vast majority of voting rights in the company after the IPO through a multi-class share structure.\n\nLoss-making teeth alignment company SmileDirectClub has seen its shares tumble since its IPO earlier this month, while Uber and rival Lyft Inc (LYFT.O), which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable, have also struggled since going public earlier this year.\n\nGoldman Sachs, KKR, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley were among the underwriters on the Endeavor IPO.", "description": "Endeavor Group Holdings , the U.S. entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood powerbroker Ari Emanuel, said on Thursday it had abandoned its initial public offering (IPO) following weak stock market investor demand.", "authors": ["Joshua Franklin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
