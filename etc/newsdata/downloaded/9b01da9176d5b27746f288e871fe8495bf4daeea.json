Support now comes in at US$0.6810 and US$0.6774.\n\nThe kiwi dollar eased to US$0.6376, having also failed to clear its September high of US$0.6450. Near-term support lies at US$0.6354.\n\nInvestors are looking ahead to the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Oct 30 when it is considered almost certain to cut rates a quarter point, and may leave the door open to further easing if needed.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nSuch a move would pile pressure on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to ease at its meeting on Nov 13 or risk an unwelcome increase in the kiwi.\n\nFutures imply around an 85 per cent chance of a quarter-point cut to 0.75 per cent, with a further move to 0.5 per cent seen likely next year.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already got to 0.75 per cent following three cuts since May and is thus considered likely to sit out a move at its meeting on Nov 5.\n\nFutures are pricing in a slim 18 per cent chance of a quarter-point cut, though that rises to round 54 per cent for December and 86 per cent for February next year.\n\nThose odds might shift if inflation data due next Wednesday prove as soft as many expect.\n\n\"This would ensure that rates markets maintain a reasonable risk of another RBA easing before year end, capping A$ rallies,\" said Westpac senior forex analysts, Sean Callow.\n\n\"Overall, a decent risk environment should support AUD/USD on dips below US$0.6800,\" he added. \"But again US$0.6900 has not given way and speculative short A$ positions are proving persistent.\"\n\nThe dovish outlook is helping keep bond yields not far from record lows. Three-year bond yields stand at 0.70 per cent, compared to 1.83 per cent at the start of this year.\n\nThe three-year bond future added 2.5 ticks on Friday to stand at 99.305, while the 10-year contract gained 3 ticks to 98.9450.\n\nNew Zealand government bonds also rallied with yields falling almost 6 basis points at the long end of the curve.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [SYDNEY] The Australian and New Zealand dollars nursed losses on Friday as a fresh bout of Brexit uncertainty undermined risk sentiment and bulls bailed on long positions after a failure to breach key chart barriers. .
