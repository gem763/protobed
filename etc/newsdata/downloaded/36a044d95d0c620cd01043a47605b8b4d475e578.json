So I wanted to see what it would look like if I put it over the video,\u201d she told HuffPost.\n\nWhen she was done, she said she was pretty pleased with her creation.\n\n\u201cI thought it was the funniest thing ever and thought that absolutely no one would agree with me,\u201d she said.\n\nShe still decided to test-drive her video on the masses \u2015 i.e., post it to Twitter.\n\ni made this simply so i can use it as a meme look away \u2014 sam (@lustsfilm) September 17, 2019\n\nTurns out, Samantha wasn\u2019t the only person who found it amusing. Her video quickly went viral.\n\nBest remix of an SNL sketch ever!!\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/nwYkxt8dKU \u2014 CLawVERfeel\ud83d\udc7d (@Cawfeel) September 20, 2019\n\nHIS FACE AT THE END IM PEEING \u2014 former woman \ud83c\udf31 \ud835\ude81 + \ud835\ude74 \ud83c\udf88 (@yippykayaymf) September 18, 2019\n\nWhen one of Samantha\u2019s friends asked her to put a different song over the Hader clip, she decided to create the Twitter account \u201cbill hader dancing to\u201d just to \u201centertain my friends.\u201d The result is an account with more than 24,000 followers and a bunch of hilarious videos in which Hader dances to everyone from Whitney Houston to Billie Eilish to Queen.\n\nTo check out some of the best, just keep scrolling.\n\ndreams- fleetwood mac pic.twitter.com/Lr4WLNMEJ0 \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 29, 2019\n\ni wanna dance with somebody (who loves me)- whitney houston pic.twitter.com/vok8EBfSz2 \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 30, 2019\n\nbad guy- billie eilish pic.twitter.com/npb82ZsSJU \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 27, 2019\n\nuptown girl- billy joel pic.twitter.com/yGpFx8ncam \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 27, 2019\n\nthe less i know the better- tame impala pic.twitter.com/PE1Cvf0NGg \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 24, 2019\n\nanother one bites the dust- queen pic.twitter.com/nuQow6czVO \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 28, 2019\n\ntruth hurts- lizzo pic.twitter.com/w8jzgmyFLr \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 29, 2019\n\ncome and get your love- redbone pic.twitter.com/ibCB1gSWSs \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) September 30, 2019\n\nmonster mash\n\n(spooky edition) pic.twitter.com/Ryz5SNdTvq \u2014 bill hader dancing to (@billhaderdancin) October 1, 2019", "description": "See the former \"SNL\" star unknowingly groove to everyone from Whitney Houston to Lizzo.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93b82e2100005100513384.png?cache=yfqd8zyapq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
