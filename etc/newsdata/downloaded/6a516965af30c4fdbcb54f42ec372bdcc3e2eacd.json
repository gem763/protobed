Elizabeth Warren speaks at the One Iowa and GLAAD LGBTQ Presidential Forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, September 20, 2019. (Scott Morgan/Reuters)\n\nThe Democratic candidate knows that stories of insurance being withdrawn are not illustrative examples of a serious problem.\n\nIf you want to run for office, political consultants will hammer away at one point: Tell stories. People respond to stories. We\u2019ve been a story-telling species since our fur-clad ancestors gathered around campfires. Don\u2019t cite statistics. No one can remember statistics. Make it human. Make it relatable. Lincoln told stories. FDR told stories. Reagan told stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatching the Democrats\u2019 fourth debate Tuesday night, you could see the candidates implementing this advice. They\u2019d mention Joe Blow in their state who said X, or Jane Blow who called their office with Y problem. They commonly use techniques such as: \u201cThe voters I speak to aren\u2019t preoccupied with the elite concerns of Washington or New York. The voters I speak to are concerned about . . .\u201d and then the candidate fills in the policy he or she is touting.\n\nThat\u2019s okay as far as it goes, but politics by anecdote should have some limits, because, as a wag once said, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Relying on anecdotes alone is how you get the anti-vaccine movement and other dangerous delusions. \u201cI knew a little boy who was totally normal and chatty until he got the MMR shot, and then he became autistic.\u201d That\u2019s tragic, but the data show that across large populations, there is no link between vaccines and autism. On the contrary, vaccines are a key public-health benefit.\n\nPoliticians owe it to us to ensure that when they use examples, they are using them to illustrate larger truths, not to mislead.\n\nElizabeth Warren fails this test. For someone who touts herself as a scholar, she resorts to anecdotes in most disingenuous fashion.\n\nAt the last debate, for example, asked to account for the cost of her \u201cplan\u201d to adopt Medicare for All, which would eliminate the private coverage enjoyed by an estimated 150 million Americans, Warren proffered stories:\n\nSo I have talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter\u2019s been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I\u2019ve talked to the young man who has MS. And here\u2019s the thing about all of them. They all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.\n\nLater, after asserting that only the wealthy and corporations would see their taxes go up under her plan, she cited the same anecdote: \u201cAnd I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, \u2018Sorry, we\u2019re not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we\u2019re not covering your expensive treatments for MS.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs there a widespread practice of insurance companies rescinding coverage when people get serious illnesses? There are only two studies of the problem dating back to the early 2000s. One, by the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, found that three companies had rescinded 20,000 policies over the course of five years \u2014 sometimes for fraud but in some cases for trivial reasons. All were policies purchased on the individual market, not through employers. Another study, by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, found that between 2004 and 2008, some 27,000 policies were rescinded out of 6.7 million individual plans surveyed. That translates to less than one half of 1 percent of policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes that mean it wasn\u2019t a problem? Not necessarily. Doubtless there were injustices \u2014 serious ones \u2014 when people found themselves facing a medical crisis and had their insurance cancelled. But there\u2019s a reason that all of the data on this practice of rescission (which insurance companies claimed was fraud prevention) predate 2010. The Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, explicitly outlawed it. As Healthcare.gov explains: \u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act, rescission is illegal except in cases of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact as prohibited by the terms of the plan or coverage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth Warren surely knows this, and thus her tales of people\u2019s insurance being withdrawn when they get sick are not illustrative examples of a serious problem. They are dishonest efforts to build a case for eliminating private health coverage. Warren, like Bernie Sanders, is an ideologue, enamored of government regulation of everything. Most Americans do not share her disdain for private health coverage. Eighty percent rate the quality of their care as excellent or good, and 69 percent rate their personal coverage the same way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey deserve leaders who will not attempt to mislead them.\n\n\u00a9 2019 CREATORS.COM", "description": "Politicians owe it to us to ensure that when they use examples, they are using them to illustrate larger truths, not to mislead.
