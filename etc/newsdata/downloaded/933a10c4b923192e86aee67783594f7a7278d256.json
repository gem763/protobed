Google\u2019s Pixel phones, on the other hand, started off expensive and with amazing camera software; the company is now letting that technology trickle down to less expensive models. So which does it better: the souped-up OnePlus 7 Pro or the pared-down Pixel 3A?\n\nYou can\u2019t take a photo without opening the app, so let\u2019s talk about specs and speed, before we get to quality.\n\nWhich does it better: the souped-up OnePlus 7 Pro or the pared-down Pixel 3A?\n\nThe OnePlus has a snappy Snapdragon 855 processor. The 3A has a mid-range Snapdragon 670 and lacks Google\u2019s custom Pixel Visual Core processor, meaning it does image processing on the main CPU and GPU, which can be a bit slower.\n\nThe Pixel\u2019s camera app is good and easy to navigate, but it defaults back to the standard, rear camera every time it opens, regardless of what you were last using. It\u2019s more frustrating than I thought it would be, especially when it\u2019s dark outside and I just want to be continuously shooting in Night Sight mode. You have to navigate to the \u201cmore\u201d section to enable it every time you open the app. If it is dark enough, the app will prompt you to use Night Sight, but that doesn\u2019t happen every time.\n\nOnePlus\u2019 app defaults to whatever camera setting you were last using. For instance, if you last took a selfie when you opened the app, it will pop up the selfie camera next time you go to take a photo. The only time this isn\u2019t true is when using the rear cameras \u2014 with these, the app will default to the standard lens every time (as opposed to the wide or telephoto). I really like that you can swipe up on any of the camera choices along the bottom to reach all your photo options. On the Pixel\u2019s photo app, you have to swipe to the last column.\n\nOn the OnePlus 7, you have the pop-up 16 megapixel f/2 selfie camera on the front. Then there are three rear cameras:\n\nan 8 megapixel f/2.4 telephoto a 16 megapixel f/2.2 wide angle, a standard 48 megapixel (scaled down to 12 megapixels when not using Pro mode) f/1.6 lens.\n\nThe Pixel 3A has two cameras: one 8-megapixel f/2 selfie camera on the front and one 12.2-megapixel f/1.8 lens on the back.\n\nAll right, let\u2019s get to the photos.\n\nWhen using the front-facing cameras, I found that the OnePlus generally fills in shadows, brightens the image, and smooths out absolutely everything more than the Pixel, even with beauty mode turned off. There\u2019s no escaping the smoothing! The Pixel, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t smooth faces, leaving pores exposed for all to see. Although it isn\u2019t always as flattering, I prefer more detail to artificial makeup.\n\nBoth cameras have a front-facing portrait mode, Although I like the Pixel\u2019s selfie camera for general use, its selfie portraits put way too much blur on the background. On both devices, the portrait cut-out is equally inaccurate. It\u2019ll look fine for instagram, but you\u2019re not going to fool anyone into thinking it was taken with a DSLR.\n\nAround back, the OnePlus does have the Pixel beat in terms of lens hardware, and I\u2019m a sucker for wide angle. So when it comes to buildings or flowers, the competition gets sticky. There is something far more epic about a subject when you have that super wide lens, and this is where OnePlus\u2019 extra hardware really comes in handy.\n\nThe wide angle lens is amazing. I found myself using it all the time, especially in New York City where everything is both cramped and profound. On the edges of the frame, details fall apart and warp, but that\u2019s not a deal breaker \u2014 it\u2019s s better than having no wide angle lens at all. The telephoto lens is really sharp too, and it certainly delivers way more detail than digitally zooming on the Pixel. If you are using the Pixel\u2019s superzoom for anything more than a laugh at how much it looks an oil paint filter\u2026 stop.\n\nThose extra lenses allow the OnePlus to shine in landscapes, and it does really well at keeping the whites white. The Pixel, on the other hand, leans blue.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the OnePlus also exposes just a bit more than the Pixel. That can be good in some situations, such as in the subway; but it\u2019s bad when the shot is high contrast, like a sunset.\n\nWhen it comes to night photography, there\u2019s no denying the Pixel\u2019s \u201cNight Sight\u201d is better than OnePlus\u2019 \u201cNightscape\u201d. The Pixel does a really nice job of keeping the details intact while smoothing a solid color, such as the sky, producing an overall brighter, more balanced photo. It does take a few seconds longer to take the photo, but for the clarity it provides, I think that\u2019s okay.\n\nLooking at the main cameras alone, the Pixel far surpasses the OnePlus in almost every lighting condition. But in the grand scheme of life it\u2019s really hard to ignore the versatility those extra lenses \u2014 the telephoto and wide angle \u2014 give you. So it comes down to what you value more and what you do with your photos. OnePlus provides versatility and more perspectives, but lacks the image quality Google provides.
