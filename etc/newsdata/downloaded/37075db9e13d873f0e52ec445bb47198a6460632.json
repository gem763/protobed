Liverpool have games coming up that they could drop points in - they might not.\"\n\nDiscussing the title race, Neville added: \"Liverpool are definitely big favourites, but if Van Dijk gets injured, or Salah gets injured it can change.\n\n\"There's thirty games to go.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"City are not right. They've set such a high standard and the back four is not right. They're conceding chances and they just didn't concede chances last year. They're not like they were.\n\n\"They set such a high standard and Liverpool matched that standard last year, barring a hair's width, if City drop below that.\n\n\"Not replacing Kompany and the injury to Laporte is a big problem for them.\n\n\"They look vulnerable. They haven't shown vulnerability for a few years and people will believe they are.\"", "description": "Man Utd will look to bounce back after the international break as they host top of the table Liverpool", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19031916.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-City-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
