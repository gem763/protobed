LOUIS (AP) - Kevin Pillar is enjoying every minute of his career season.\n\nThe Giants outfielder had four hits, including a go-ahead, two-run homer in the eighth inning, and San Francisco rallied to cool off the St. Louis Cardinals 9-8 Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cEvery time I hit one, it\u2019s still special,\u201d Pillar said. \u201cThey all feel like my first.\u201d\n\nBrandon Crawford and Mike Yastrzemski also homered for San Francisco, which snapped a four-game losing streak.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt drove in four runs and Paul DeJong homered for St. Louis, which lost for just the fourth time in 18 games. St. Louis remained 2 1/2 games ahead of the Chicago Cubs in the NL Central.\n\nPillar had three RBIs. He hit a two-run homer off Giovanny Gallegos in the eighth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to do it more frequently this year,\u201d Pillar said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same feeling I\u2019ve always wanted to have, always dreamed about doing since I was a little kid.\u201d\n\nPillar\u2019s 21st homer is well ahead of his previous best of 16 in 2017 with the Blue Jays. He has 79 RBIs, 20 more than his prior best last year with Toronto.\n\n\u201cA lot of times his (hits) are in big situations,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cHe\u2019s been huge for us this year.\u201d\n\nA seven-year veteran, Pillar also singled in the third, fifth and sixth innings.\n\nWill Smith recorded four outs for his 31st save in 35 chances. He struck out Goldschmidt with the tying run at third to end the eighth, then punched out Harrison Bader with two on to end the game.\n\nThe Giants were able to fight back after surrendering 4-0 and 7-4 leads.\n\n\u201cWe found a way to win a ballgame against a very good team,\u201d San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cYou keep battling and these guys did it.\u201d\n\nGoldschmidt hit a two-run triple in the fifth to tie it at 4. He also highlighted a four-run outburst in the sixth with a two-run double to give St. Louis an 8-7 lead.\n\n\u201cWe just try and play the best we can,\u201d Goldschmidt said. \u201cWe just came up one run short.\u201d\n\nRookie right-hander Tyler Rogers (1-0) got his first career victory with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.\n\nGallegos (3-2) went two months and 19 appearances without allowing a homer before giving up Giants rookie Mauricio Dubon\u2019s solo shot Monday. This was his first appearance since then.\n\nEvan Longoria started the eighth-inning comeback with a leadoff single to set the stage for Pillar\u2019s go-ahead blast.\n\nCrawford hit a three-run homer in sixth to break a 4-4 tie.\n\nSan Francisco starter Madison Bumgarner allowed six runs and nine hits over five innings. He struck out two and walked one.\n\n\u201cThey did a great job of picking me up when I didn\u2019t do a lot for us,\u201d Bumgarner said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis starter Michael Wacha, working on three days of rest, did not allow a run over two innings. He gave up two hits, struck out two and walked one in an opener role.\n\nDeJong\u2019s 25th homer of the season in the fourth pulled St. Louis within 4-2. Yastrzemski\u2019s 19th homer of the season triggered a four-run outburst in third.\n\nThe 4 hour, 5-minute contest featured 28 hits, 13 pitchers and 365 pitches.\n\nPOPULAR BIRDS\n\nThe Cardinals passed the three million mark in attendance for the 16th successive season with a crowd of 41,945. St. Louis, with 3,037,876, joined the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees as the only teams to pass the three million mark this season.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nGiants: INF Pablo Sandoval had season-ending Tommy John surgery performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache. He also had loose bodies removed from the back of his right elbow. \u2026 RHP Reyes Moronta was moved to the 60-day injured list with a torn labrum in his right shoulder.\n\nCardinals: C Matt Wieters, who has been slowed by calf strain, continues to make progress. He is hoping to begin baseball activities within the next few days.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSt. Louis RHP Dakota Hudson (14-6, 3.53) will face RHP Logan Webb (1-0, 3.52) in the final game of the four-game set Thursday afternoon. Hudson has won last four starts. Webb is making his fourth major league start. He has struck out seven in two of the three starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kevin Pillar is enjoying every minute of his career season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Overbey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/giants_cardinals_baseball_87588_c0-172-4120-2574_s1770x1032.jpg?bc6244edc4ebccf69569d971446165ca45a7eb4d", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
