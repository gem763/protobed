After her death, some 30 were transferred to her family under a Maltese civil law that allows claimants to pursue actions against the heirs of a deceased defendant.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I understand that in accordance with Maltese law, in defamation suits the burden of proof lies with the respondents,\u201d wrote Mijatovi\u0107.\n\nWhile noting the laws on bringing a case against a defendant\u2019s estate, she voiced concern that \u201cin the case of Daphne Caruana Galizia, this means that her heirs could be expected to reveal information on her journalistic work and sources.\n\n\u201cThis is not only an excessive and very complex burden for the respondents but may also constitute an undue interference with the right to protection of journalistic sources,\u201d Mijatovi\u0107 wrote. Saying the cases placed \u201cunwarranted psychological and financial pressure\u201d on the reporter\u2019s family she added: \u201cContinuing these claims \u2013 many of which were lodged by public officials including yourself \u2013 is not only perceived as an intimidation of a family faced with the loss of their loved one but also raises questions regarding the Maltese authorities\u2019 commitment to finding and bringing the masterminds of this horrendous crime to justice.\u201d\n\nCaruana Galizia, described by supporters as a \u201cone-woman WikiLeaks\u201d, had highlighted corruption in Maltese politics and Muscat was a frequent target, as was the country\u2019s opposition.\n\nMuscat has insisted he will only drop his personal defamation cases if the journalist\u2019s family \u201caccepts the findings\u201d of an inquiry that he claimed exonerated him. On Thursday he insisted the government \u201ccannot interfere in, abolish or truncate civil actions\u201d.\n\nDaphne Caruana Galizia\u2019s son: \u2018They killed my mother but they won\u2019t stop me\u2019 Read more\n\nMijatovi\u0107 went on to tell Muscat, who had said his government was committed to reforming libel laws, that such laws \u201cput journalists and their families at risk and have a chilling effect on investigative journalism in particular. I urge your authorities to take measures to repeal these provisions which represent a real threat to journalistic freedom in your country,\u201d she concluded.\n\nCaruana Galizia\u2019s family insisted they would \u201cnot succumb to blackmail\u201d, adding they did not have access to the full inquiry and could not comment on the findings.\n\n\u201cOur position on not accepting blackmail will never change,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nAfter Caruana Galizia\u2019s death, her sons called on Muscat to resign, accusing him of failing to uphold fundamental freedoms on the island, an EU member since 2004, and creating a culture of political impunity.\n\nIn July, three suspects arrested weeks after the bombing were sent for trial but the identities of those ordering the killing remain unclear.", "description": "Council of Europe warns cases transferred to late journalist\u2019s family jeopardise sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1c48f314ad9680af9b8fd6d86fff670faf360c9/0_201_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=43135997b45893e5fe58df34f16b7ef3", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
