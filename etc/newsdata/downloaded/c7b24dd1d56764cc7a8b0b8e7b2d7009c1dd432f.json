He comes aboard at a key time in the House impeachment investigation; the White House has said it will not comply with Democratic subpoenas because, Trump has said, the process is unfair.\n\nHouse Democrats are looking into whether Trump abused his power by asking the president of Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden at the same time the White House was withholding aid to Kiev.\n\nGowdy is perhaps best known for chairing hearings into the Barack Obama administration's handling of terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya. His new title will be \"counsel to the president.\"\n\nGowdy, who was spotted at the White House on Tuesday, is expected to make many television appearances on Trump's behalf.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter advising House Democrats that the administration would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry because it considers the probe to be \"illegitimate.\"\n\n\"You have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process,\" Cipollone said in the letter.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump retains Benghazi investigator Trey Gowdy amid impeachment probe", "description": "Former Republican congressman Trey Gowdy will assist the White House in its impeachment defense, one of Donald Trump's attorneys said Wednesday.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sV_wzM0ed8QxjlDots43Uw--~B/aD0zNjY2O3c9NTE1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/8111ca3dda54d15ed1ea2e6e21f960cd", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
