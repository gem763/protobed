Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nTrump and Romney have a contentious political relationship that started when Romney asked the famous billionaire to endorse him for president in the 2008 campaign. Despite Trump\u2019s effusive praise for Romney in his failed run for president, Romney did not return the favor in 2016.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican primary, Romney famously attempted to stop Trump with a lengthy \u201cnever Trump\u201d speech, deriding Trump as a \u201ccon-man.\u201d In response, Trump derided Romney as a \u201cchoker\u201d and mocked him for walking like a penguin.\n\nWhen Trump won the 2016 election, Romney met with Trump at his club in New Jersey to discuss a possible job as Secretary of State, but Trump turned him down.\n\nRomney ran for Senator of Utah instead and asked Trump for his endorsement, which the president gave.", "description": "President Donald Trump ridiculed Mitt Romney as an \"ass\" on Saturday after the failed Republican presidential candidate criticized him.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/trump-yelling-behind-romney-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
