Dolemite Is My Name star Eddie Murphy is making his way back on stage for his first stand-up special in over 30 years. But just because he\u2019s back being \u201cha-ha\u201d funny in front of a live audience doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s back to all of his old ways. For starters, he won\u2019t be wearing leather like he did in Raw and Delirious, both shot in the 1980s, both done wearing leather suits. \u201cNah, man, you can\u2019t wear a leather suit at 58,\u201d he told the New York Times in a recent interview. That is, despite the fact that \u201cif you watched Raw or Delirious,\u201d you\u2019d know that Eddie Murphy doesn\u2019t sweat.\n\nAfter being a celebrity for most of his life, Murphy recognizes when it\u2019s time to leave something in the past. Speaking on recent controversies over comedians \u201cpushing boundaries,\u201d Murphy shrugs. \u201cI went through all that stuff, so this is not scary,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this stuff they are talking about: \u2018Hey, welcome to the club.\u2019\u201d In 1996, he apologized for jokes about AIDS and now calls them \u201cignorant.\u201d Not as easy as simply not making bigoted jokes, but is an apology really that hard? We\u2019ll all see what Eddie Murphy \u2014 with 30 extra years of wisdom \u2014 has to say when he heads on tour and releases a special on Netflix in 2020, sans leather.", "description": "\u2019Dolemite Is My Name\u2019 star Eddie Murphy discusses returning to stand-up comedy after a 30-year break.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-eddie-murphy.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
