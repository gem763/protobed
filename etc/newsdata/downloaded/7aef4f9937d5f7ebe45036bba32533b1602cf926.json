They know brokers have to be cautious when they start talking about proper cornerstone bids or when using words like \"covered\".\n\nAs Street Talk revealed on Monday morning, Latitude's big three investors and brokers decided to reprice the deal following talks with potential investors over the weekend.\n\nThe new price represented 11-times forward cash profit, a 5.8 per cent dividend yield and, if successful, would see the listed Latitude worth $3.165 billion. It was cut from $2 a share or 12.4-times profit.\n\nThe proposed structure would see KKR own 21.4 per cent of the business on listing, while Varde Partners would have 21.5 per cent and Deutsche Bank 13.5 per cent.\n\nWhile there is plenty of attention on Latitude because it is the year's biggest IPO, its plight could also go a long way towards deciding the fate of other float candidates in the pipeline.\n\nShould Latitude get away and trade well in the aftermarket, all those involved at the likes of PropertyGuru, Onsite Rental Group, Retail Zoo, Tyro Payments and other IPO contenders will feel more confident about their own offers. If it fails, it could bring a few others down with it.\n\nIt comes at an interesting time for Australian IPOs. Investors have rushed to technology sector and yield-based listings, such as Home Consortium and FINEOS Corporation, but have rejected others including gas services provider MPC Kinetic last week.\n\nLatitude's float has been pitched along both tech and yield lines. It is a consumer finance business that is majority owned by three financial investors and specialises in point of sale finance, credit cards and loans.\n\nThe company expects $1.1 billion in operating income and $287.6 million cash net profit in the 12 months to June 2020.", "description": "It's D-day for the year's biggest initial public offering.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a00ef13b6745907e406b749a5cbc646d271f4fdf", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
