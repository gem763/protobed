The result was a catastrophe.'\n\nMiss Brimble was killed in the collision and Bayliss was so severely injured he was not fit to be charged over her death.\n\nBrooks denied causing Miss Brimble's death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury to Mr Bayliss by dangerous driving.\n\nSophie Brimble, the girlfriend of Mr Bayliss, was in the front passenger seat of his Volkswagen Polo when it smashed into a lamppost on July 26 2017\n\nBut he was found guilty by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court.\n\nThe court heard Brooks knew Bayliss and instigated the race when he recognised Bayliss' VW Polo.\n\nMr Cobbe said: 'Mr Bayliss was not solely responsible for the collision.\n\n'Mr Bayliss was driving at excessive speed because he had got himself involved in an impromptu race with Mr Brooks.\n\n'It is a race that started about half a mile prior to the collision.'\n\nMr Cobbe said 'aggressive' driving by Bayliss and Brooks drove their VW Polo and VW Bora 'deteriorated into the impromptu race that in turn caused the catastrophic collision.'\n\nHe said: 'They both then drove at high speed along that road, having little or no regard to their excessive speed of the fact that it was through a residential area.\n\n'They pushed their vehicles hard through this residential area, both of them reaching speeds in excess of 80mph, their focus now on their race.'\n\nBut the court heard Bayliss crashed into a metal lamppost and Sophie, of Crickhowell, Powys, died in July 2017.\n\nMr Cobbe said Bayliss and Brooks 'share responsibility' for Sophie's death.\n\nBrooks, of Ebbw Vale, was warned to expect a 'substantial' prison sentence by Judge Michael Fitton.\n\nHe will be sentenced on November 18.", "description": "Neil Brooks (pictured), 49, raced his friend Jay Bayliss, 25, through residential 30mph streets in a late-night burn-up between Ebbw Vale and Brynmawr, South Wales.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/19/20392764-0-image-a-31_1572464097824.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
