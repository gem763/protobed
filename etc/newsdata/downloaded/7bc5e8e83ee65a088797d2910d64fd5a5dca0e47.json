Several personal lawyers for the president dealing with the subject. A lurking presence at Capitol Hill impeachment-focused hearings.

Near-daily media appearances discussing the topic.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis technically nonexistent yet omnipresent force has been critical in stymying Democrats\u2019 attempts to build their case for removing Trump from office. Trump\u2019s lawyers have helped block testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn \u2014 a key player in the most potentially damning stories from Robert Mueller\u2019s report \u2014 fought lawmakers and prosecutors trying to see the president\u2019s personal tax returns and protected the former special counsel\u2019s most sensitive secrets. They\u2019ve also advised ex-Trump staffers like Corey Lewandowski and Hope Hicks as they faced grillings from congressional Democrats.\n\nThat the president\u2019s representatives don\u2019t want to call their work what it is \u2014 preventing Trump\u2019s potential impeachment \u2014 is no surprise. Any recognition that they\u2019ve taken such an official step would be a giant red flag that they think things are more serious than they are. Still, the Trump lawyers\u2019 combined mission effectively is to stop impeachment before it starts.\n\n\u201cNo one is prepping for anything like that,\u201d said Trump attorney Jay Sekulow, the longest-serving member of the Trump personal legal team, when asked to describe the president\u2019s legal strategy for impeachment. \u201cWe\u2019ve got very capable lawyers handling the issues that are currently pending and we\u2019ll work on those as appropriate.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

That freed them up to launch a public relations blitz meant to undermine the special counsel and cripple any impeachment-fueling evidence he turned up.\n\nThat\u2019s where we are now.\n\nTo start the new year, Trump brought in Pat Cipollone to replace McGahn as White House counsel, a position that makes him the public figurehead and final say on all impeachment-related matters for the powerful office. Cipollone in turn hired Michael Purpura, a former top aide to President George W. Bush, to lead a team that has since grown to nearly 20 attorneys who have repeatedly jostled with oversight-focused House Democrats to limit what they can get from potential witnesses.\n\nTrump is also getting air cover from the Justice Department.\n\nThe department\u2019s civil division \u2014 run by Jody Hunt, a former chief of staff for ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2014 is defending the president in several impeachment-related lawsuits. In one key case that will be argued early next month before a federal judge in Washington D.C., Hunt\u2019s team has argued that since Congress isn\u2019t in a formal impeachment process, it shouldn\u2019t be given access to the secret testimony and evidence Mueller collected in front of the grand jury.\n\nDOJ lawyers are also slated to appear at a separate hearing on Halloween challenging Democrats\u2019 attempts to enforce a subpoena for McGahn\u2019s testimony.\n\nSeveral private attorneys have Trump\u2019s back, too.\n\nWilliam Consovoy, a Northern Virginia-based former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, has taken a lead role in several lawsuits to protect the release of the president\u2019s tax returns. Consovoy has one case challenging House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal\u2019s attempts to secure the documents. And last Thursday, he filed suit against Manhattan\u2019s district attorney, arguing that it\u2019s unconstitutional for a local prosecutor to be investigating a sitting president over hush-money payments made during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThen there\u2019s the PR push.\n\nThe messaging campaign most prominently features Trump stalwart Rudy Giuliani. The former New York mayor makes frequent and combative appearances on cable news while dishing out hyperbolic social media posts. \u201cAll the witch-hunt committees should be challenged in court,\u201d he recently wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn the wake of the latest possible impeachment-fueling Trump scandal \u2014 a buried whistleblower complaint about the president\u2019s communications with a foreign leader \u2014 it was Giuliani who went on CNN Thursday night to redirect the public\u2019s attention, sparking headlines with a pugnacious rant about Ukraine and Joe Biden.\n\nCentral to the entire legal effort is Sekulow, who has represented the president since mid-2017.\n\nSekulow routinely uses his own daily radio program to critique Trump\u2019s investigators. Sekulow recently dedicated an entire show to mocking and trashing House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler\u2019s efforts to collect information for potential impeachment proceedings. He took particular issue with a resolution the Democrat had circulated laying out the rules for the committee\u2019s impeachment probe, latching on to a clause that allows Trump\u2019s lawyers to respond in writing to evidence collected in both public and private settings.\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s us, not the White House counsel, right? We\u2019re the president\u2019s counsel,\u201d Sekulow asked live on air while joking with his co-hosts about whether Nadler was serious with the offer.\n\nTrump attorney Jay Sekulow. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images for GMA\n\nIn past House impeachment probes for Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, the Judiciary panel gave the president\u2019s attorneys wide berth to respond to any charges, including by allowing the cross-examination of witnesses. With their resolution, Nadler\u2019s Democrats didn\u2019t go as far as those historical examples but did seem to be opening the door to lengthy retorts from the president\u2019s attorneys.\n\n\u201cI bet they really want that,\u201d said Jordan Sekulow, the show\u2019s co-host and Jay Sekulow\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think they do,\u201d his father replied.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers aren\u2019t just filing court papers, writing letters to Congress and throttling their opponents in public. They\u2019re also showing up on Capitol Hill.\n\nLast week, Purpura, White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin and Curtis Gannon, a top DOJ attorney in the Office of Legal Counsel, had front-row seats during the Lewandowski hearing. They whispered occasionally to the former Trump campaign manager\u2019s attorney, even though his client never worked in the White House. During breaks, they joined Lewandowski and Republican lawmakers in the committee\u2019s GOP antechamber.\n\n\u201cThey were observers,\u201d said Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s ranking member, when asked about the Trump lawyers who were present during the hearing.\n\nDemocrats saw things differently.\n\n\u201cThat was a pretty a stunning sight and it may be an indicator of what\u2019s to come in terms of how aggressively they\u2019ll be trying to prevent the American public from having access to the truth,\u201d said Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democratic Judiciary Committee member.\n\n\u201cJust in terms of the optics, which obviously they don\u2019t care about, they have an iron grip over these witnesses. That\u2019s for sure,\u201d she added.\n\nSeveral Democrats even see the Trump team\u2019s efforts to guide and influence congressional witnesses as an attempt to stymie Congress\u2019s legitimate oversight authorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called obstruction,\u201d argued Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, a Pennsylvania Democrat who serves as vice-chair of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nAnd it could be used as evidence to support an article of impeachment for contempt of Congress, several Democrats argued.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 frustration over the role that Trump lawyers are playing in the process has boiled over at times.\n\nDuring Hicks\u2019 closed-door deposition in June, Nadler opened by saying DOJ attorneys \u2014 in this case Gannon \u2014 aren\u2019t normally allowed to sit in for an interview when the employee didn\u2019t work for the department.\n\n\u201cHowever, in the interest of accommodating both the witness and the White House an exception is being made in this one case, and the department's presence is permitted,\u201d the New York Democrat said.\n\nBut Nadler showed his annoyance a short while later after the Trump lawyers blocked Hicks from responding when she was asked to explain whether Lewandowski had been hired to work in the White House.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/de/8a/441712144ad280c17cc14ead3787/coreyl.png\" true\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of public record. Why would you object?\u201d Nadler said.\n\nPurpura, the White House attorney who was also sitting in on the interview, replied that there\u2019s a \u201clongstanding executive branch precedent\u201d that says Hicks can\u2019t be forced to talk about things she worked on as a senior adviser to the president.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, that is absolute nonsense as a matter of law,\u201d Nadler replied.\n\nAs they eye next steps on impeachment, Trump\u2019s lawyers do have plenty of precedent to consider.\n\nOver an eight-year term clouded by investigations, Clinton deployed a broad legal defense that included multiple White House lawyers and former Arkansas Democratic Sen. Dale Bumpers. The ex-lawmaker delivered a closing argument during a Senate impeachment trial that concluded with the Democrat\u2019s acquittal. Clinton\u2019s personal attorneys were also deployed to aggressively push back against potential criminal proceedings. One of them, David Kendall, even got to cross-examine independent counsel Kenneth Starr during a nationally-televised Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing.\n\n\u201cIt's a daunting exercise, but let me begin with the simple but powerful truth that nothing in this overkill of investigation amounts to a justification for the impeachment of the president of the United States,\u201d Kendall told the lawmakers as he opened a 30-minute exchange with the president\u2019s chief nemesis.\n\nNixon didn\u2019t have nearly the support that Clinton did. Several of the Republican president\u2019s top White House attorneys faced criminal charges of their own during the Watergate scandal. And Nixon was also frequently at odds with his Justice Department, angry that they weren\u2019t helping shut down the Watergate investigation. Eventually, he fired the top ranks at the agency in the infamous \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d in an attempt to install leaders who would help him stymie investigators.\n\nNixon, the only president in U.S. history to resign from office, ultimately leaned on an outside attorney, James St. Clair, to defend him.\n\n''I don't represent Mr. Nixon personally,\u201d St. Clair told the New York Times. \u201cI represent him in his capacity as president.''\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson, who was impeached but not convicted over his handling of Reconstruction, survived in office with the backing of a team of lawyers that included former Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Robbins Curtis and Henry Stanbery, who resigned as attorney general to defend Johnson.\n\nBy leaning as heavily as he does on White House and DOJ attorneys, Trump has already strayed well beyond the bounds of anything done by his historic predecessors, said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor who has written books on impeachment.\n\n\u201cThere were lots of people whose heads rolled to keep Nixon from dominating the Justice Department. The DOJ in the end was not Nixon\u2019s friend. With this administration, the DOJ is just another part of the White House counsel\u2019s office,\u201d he said.\n\nGerhardt, who has testified multiple times on impeachment at the request of both Democrats and Republicans, said there\u2019s no good political reason for Trump to officially designate a legal team to handle the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d only be hurtful for them to say we\u2019re scared or anything like that,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Gerhardt said the Trump legal strategy is obvious.\n\n\u201cHis defense in part is to just produce confusion and chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s served him well until now. It\u2019s his way of blowing smoke. And so having different people speaking for him in different ways and at different times, and his own bluster on Twitter and elsewhere, all that together is his defense. It\u2019s designed to keep people off balance.\u201d\n\nA senior Trump administration official argued that there\u2019s no need to designate a formal impeachment team when Democrats themselves are still quibbling over their own game plan.\n\n\u201cUntil you are at that level it\u2019s difficult to make decisions about representation,\u201d the senior official said. \u201c[Andrew] Johnson handled it differently than Nixon, who handled it differently than Clinton. But our fundamental problem here is that we have no idea what the House Judiciary Committee is doing and apparently they don\u2019t either.\u201d\n\nWilliam Jeffress, a prominent Washington defense attorney who represented Nixon after his resignation until the president\u2019s death in 1994, said he expects the Trump White House counsel\u2019s office \u201cto be front and center\u201d on impeachment because only it and \u201cnot the president\u2019s personal lawyers, can instruct present and former White House officials not to cooperate.\u201d\n\nAnd for political reasons as much as anything else, Jeffress predicted the White House strategy as it faces Democrats will continue to be \u201cunrelenting stonewall on the legal front.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though I feel sure Trump and his advisers do not see much likelihood of losing an impeachment vote in the House, and no likelihood of a conviction in the Senate, they will at every opportunity seek to cast the proceeding as an illegitimate effort to overturn the election,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause Trump gets great political mileage from that argument.\u201d", "description": "The president has a technically nonexistent yet omnipresent force that has been critical in stymying Democrats\u2019 attempts to build their case for removing Trump from office.", "authors": ["Darren Samuelsohn"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b8/94/af8edb2c4b4e889662af41f3d2a9/190920-giuliani-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
