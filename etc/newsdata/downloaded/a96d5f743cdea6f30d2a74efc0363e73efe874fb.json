His accuracy from the tee and serene composure went a long way to the Boks advancing to the semi-finals where they ultimately came up two points short against the eventual champions New Zealand.\n\nOn Sunday, the 25-year-old Pollard will again lead the Boks line in a World Cup semi-final. The opposition might be different and the context completely different too, but Pollard\u2019s job remains central to South Africa\u2019s chances of winning.\n\nSince that 2015 setback, Wales have won four in a row against South Africa. The only way for the Springboks to prevent that sequence extending to five defeats, is for Pollard to rise to the levels he displayed at Twickenham 48 months ago.\n\nA lot has happened to the fly-half since then, which cost him a great deal of time on the field. Soon after the 2015 tournament, Pollard sustained a shoulder injury playing club rugby in Japan.\n\nHe nursed the injury and started the 2016 Super Rugby pre-season with the Bulls in Pretoria. On a hot midweek afternoon, Pollard received a pass in training and planted his foot incorrectly. His body weight, coupled with momentum, snapped his anterior cruciate ligament. His season was over.\n\n\u201cI decided to have an operation on my right shoulder soon after the knee, seeing as I was out for months anyway,\u201d Pollard told me in an interview last year.\n\n\u201cBut I contracted a bug in the hospital and the shoulder became infected. Then came the real complications, which made me really think about life.\n\n\u201cIt got to the point where the doctors raised the subject of amputating my arm, although it wasn\u2019t an immediate option. I spent six weeks in hospital, pumped full of antibiotics about seven hours a day.\u201d\n\nThe medication worked and the infection cleared. But it was an experience that put life in perspective for a player who was the \u201cchosen one\u201d of South African rugby.\n\nFrom his schoolboy days as a starlet to steering the Junior Boks to the 2012 U20 World Championship title as an 18-year-old, to being named as 2014 World Junior Player of the Year ahead of England\u2019s Maro Itoje, Pollard has always been destined for greatness.\n\nBut greatness has eluded him despite some standout performances at the highest level of the game. Injuries and the inconsistency of Springbok rugby since the last World Cup, have made Pollard understand that his potential and promise are not guarantees of senior success.\n\nOn Sunday against Wales though, he has the chance to move closer to the greats of the game.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pollard attacks during the Springboks\u2019 quarter-final win against Wales four years ago.

Pollard gave off an air of quiet confidence in Yokohama on Friday, knowing that his performance on Sunday, his role and his execution, could define the contest for South Africa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an interesting chess match,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cThe two teams will feel each other out tactically in the first 20 minutes and from there it will be about applying the pressure and converting it into points.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that Wales are known for their flair. They can be relentless in terms of implementing their game plan. When they control the set piece and enforce their kicking game, they can start to suffocate you. We have to be careful about falling into that trap.\u201d\n\nPollard is a big unit, nearly 100kg. He will take the ball to the line and test opposite number Dan Biggar. The outcome could be decided by one score and neither side is going to want to play inside their own half.\n\nThere are too many good goal-kickers on the field waiting for a chance to kick penalties that will inevitably come.\n\nWarren Gatland\u2019s 12-year Wales rollercoaster reaches the final straight | Paul Rees Read more\n\nPollard has to steer the Boks into the right parts of the field where his natural ability, vision and skill can give the two-time world champions a better than even chance of winning.\n\nAll he needs is a platform from the forwards to pull the strings on the stage he was born to perform on.\n\nCraig Ray is a Cape Town-based sports writer and part of the Guardian\u2019s experts\u2019 network at the 2019 Rugby World Cup.", "description": "The Springboks fly-half has always been destined for the big stage but illness and injuries put his playing career in perspective after stalling his progress on the pitch", "authors": ["Craig Ray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46e7b3386382b14226098ead8ed67c5e4577da04/68_23_4467_2680/master/4467.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=201f1669e3a41d5858ca067c010d4b50", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
