The Outlook is Stable. HBL's other ratings were also affirmed at the same time.

This should support asset quality and capitalisation through the cycle. Underwriting standards remain tight through Australian regulator intervention spanning back several years and the bank has improved risk controls, although they still lag those of larger peers. HBL benefits from a stable business model and loyal member base, with support from its community ties. However, the bank has a small market share and is a price taker in its core markets. Fitch does not expect significant improvements in HBL's franchise in the short-to-medium term without acquisition activity, but this is not a focus for the bank. The bank's asset quality metrics are comparable with that of its domestic peer group and loan impairments remain at modest levels that compare favourably against international peers. Asset quality is supported by HBL's underwriting criteria and mortgage mix, which has a low level of higher-risk exposures such as interest-only or investor mortgages. Some deterioration in loan impairments from prevailing low levels is possible over the next 18 months, but should remain manageable by the bank. HBL's earnings and profitability metrics lag behind those of some peers due to the bank's mutual ownership structure, which results in a greater focus on customer service and a reliance on the broker channel to generate growth. Fitch expects HBL's profitability to remain broadly stable over the next year or two. The benefits of loan growth could be offset by margin pressure and rising regulatory and investment costs in the short term. In the longer term, investments could assist the bank to deliver greater efficiencies. HBL maintains sufficient capitalisation buffers above regulatory minimums, which is likely to remain the case. Fitch believes these buffers as prudent due to the small absolute size of the bank's capital base and its limited access to new common equity. The quality of capital is strong, predominantly comprising retained earnings. SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS HBL's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect Fitch's view that while support from the authorities is possible, it cannot be relied upon due to the bank's small market share and low systemic importance. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The rating of the subordinated debt issued by HBL is notched down one level from the anchor Viability Rating for loss severity due to the potential of a partial writedown. No notching has been applied for non-performance risk. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VIABILITY RATING AND SENIOR DEBT HBL's Viability Rating, IDRs and senior debt ratings are sensitive to any weakening in its risk appetite. This is most likely to be evident from more aggressive underwriting standards or looser risk controls in an effort to improve the franchise. This may manifest in a larger-than-peer deterioration in asset quality, profitability and capitalisation in the event of a downturn in the operating environment. Strong asset growth may also challenge the funding profile, which could pressure ratings if not offset through adequate capital and liquidity management. Positive rating action would require a substantial improvement in the bank's franchise and market share, which does not appear probable in the short term. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR HBL's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to changes in Fitch's assumptions about the propensity or ability of the Australian sovereign (AAA/Stable) to provide timely support. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The subordinated debt rating of HBL is broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect its anchor rating, the Viability Rating.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
