He didn't tap his card. The security officer didn't say anything to the other guy, but to me he was asking to see my ID as if I'd done something wrong,\" Mason said.\n\nMason said he asked the guard, who he said was a black man, why he wanted to see his ID and said the updated University of Ottawa policy meant he didn't have to present identification.\n\nMason said his key pass was proof he should be able to access the building and he even pointed to a photo of himself on the wall, part of a collage that included student-staff community advisors, but the guard didn't stop.\n\n\"I'm really just wondering, why is this such a big issue for me to go to my room? I live here, the proof is right there on the wall behind him. He refused to acknowledge that,\" Mason said.\n\nWiliston Mason's photo appears in this photo collage with other student-staff of the residence. He said he tried to point his photo out to the security guard, but it was not acknowledged.

He was putting his hands on me. That is not something that should happen to any student on campus, no matter the colour of their skin,\" Mason said.\n\nHe said he turned to other students and asked them to confirm he lived in the building, which he said they did.\n\nStill, Mason said, he had to call the campus Protection Services, who eventually intervened and allowed him to proceed after they checked his key card was in order.\n\nMason said he has filed a complaint with the university president and the security company, as well as filing a report with police.\n\n\"I'm really concerned because I both live here and I work here,\" he said.\n\n\"How am I supposed to come here every single day and feel safe, knowing that there's a security guard who is clearly abusing their power?\"\n\nGuard banned from campus\n\nIn a statement, the University of Ottawa said the security guard worked for a private firm under contract with the university.\n\nThe university says it contacted the company to notify them of the incident and make sure they comply with the university's policy for interacting with students, which were updated following an incident in June where a black student was handcuffed.\n\nThe university says the private security officer involved is no longer allowed to be on campus.\n\nIt says the school's Office of Human Rights is in contact with Mason.\n\nThe University of Ottawa says its Office of Human Rights is looking at the alleged incident. It also contacted the private security company that the guard worked for and the guard involved in the incident is no longer allowed on campus. (Jean-Sebastien Marier/CBC)\n\nThe new policy says requests for identification \"must never be requested randomly and arbitrarily\" and can't be routine practice.\n\nOttawa police confirmed they were investigating a report of an assault on Sept. 14 around 10 p.m., but they would not provide further details.", "description": "Wiliston Mason says he doesn't understand why a security guard blocked his way and demanded his identification at his own University of Ottawa residence\u00a0\u2014 the same place where he works as a community advisor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290798.1568976907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wiliston-mason-sept-19-2019.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
