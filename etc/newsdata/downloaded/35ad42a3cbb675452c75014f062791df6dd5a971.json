It\u2019s simply a loving, R-rated portrait of Rudy Ray Moore, a nobody who had the guts to believe in himself when no one else did, featuring a killer comeback Eddie Murphy performance.\n\nThe self-proclaimed \u201cGodfather of rap,\u201d Moore was an Army veteran, standup comedian, musician and born performer who in the 1970s came to niche prominence for his rhythmic and raunchy Dolemite act. That character would beget both standup albums and the 1975 Blaxploitation film \u201cDolemite,\u201d a low-budget production (reports say it cost around $100,000 to make) that made some $10 million at the box office.\n\nBut it\u2019s almost irrelevant whether you know Moore\u2019s name well, and how he inspired the likes of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, or are learning about him for the first time: \u201cDolemite Is My Name\u201d is just a good piece of entertainment. And it\u2019s the kind of film that will help his legacy live on (Moore died in 2008 at age 81). It makes sense that the script comes by way of screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who did something similar for the cult filmmaker Ed Wood.\n\nDirected by Craig Brewer (\u201cHustle & Flow\u201d), \u201cDolemite Is My Name\u201d transports you to Moore\u2019s 1970s Los Angeles, thanks to Ruth E. Carter\u2019s evocative costumes and Clay Griffith\u2019s production design. There\u2019s nothing terribly interesting about the way it\u2019s told, it\u2019s just a straightforward underdog story with a big beating heart.\n\nMurphy plays Moore with a wide-eyed eagerness we typically only see on screen in much younger characters. He\u2019s constantly told no or to stay in his lane. Even his friends (Craig Robinson, Mike Epps and Tituss Burgess among them) look at him with that kind of half-pitying/half-supportive smile that will leave the audience wondering if this is just a big dreamer who might not actually make it.\n\nBut he has an eye for talent and at a low point borrows some material from a local homeless man about a larger-than-life character named Dolemite, and, finally he\u2019s got people\u2019s attention. But there are still many, many no\u2019s he\u2019ll have to overcome to get an album made and then released. And we haven\u2019t even gotten to the cult classic movie yet.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a joy spending time with Moore as he ascends in the comedy world, the film really kicks into gear when he gets the idea to make a film one night after he and his buddies decide to see a movie - something funny - and are left scratching their heads at a packed showing of Billy Wilder\u2019s 1974 remake of \u201cThe Front Page\u201d with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, wondering what the appeal is.\n\nSo they decide to make something that they want to see (kung-fu, nudity and action are a few of the requirements). Moore scrapes together money, friends, acquaintances, some strangers (a playwright played by Keegan-Michael Key, and actor D\u2019Urville Martin, played by Wesley Snipes) and a few film school students and sets off to make a feature. The only problem? None of them really know how to make a movie. But they do their best which is often funny and always endearing.\n\nAside from Murphy, who eases back into stardom seamlessly, the other standout performance comes from Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph, a Tony-nominated stage actress who bursts off the screen as comedian Lady Reed. Moore \u201cdiscovers\u201d her one night on tour as someone with presence.\n\n\u201cSome people walk around with their own personal spotlight,\u201d Murphy\u2019s Moore tells her. The same could be said of Randolph, or Moore himself and it\u2019s a lovely thing to have a very good film like \u201cDolemite Is My Name\u201d to show off both.\n\n\u201cDolemite Is My Name,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \u201csome sexuality, full nudity and brief language.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA Definition of R: Restricted.
