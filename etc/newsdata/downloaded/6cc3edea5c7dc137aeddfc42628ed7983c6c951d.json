It\u2019s hard to say for sure until the big event, which starts at 10AM ET on Tuesday, October 15th. We\u2019ll be live at the event with the latest, and the Pixel 4 will likely be the main focus.\n\nHere\u2019s what that massive supply of leaks has told us so far: the Pixel 4 will be announced, alongside a larger Pixel 4 XL. Both will have 90Hz refresh rate displays, which will make everything you do on the screen look more fluid. Also, Soli radar will be built into the phones, bringing Google\u2019s long-in-development gesture tech to fruition once and for all. This will allow you to execute certain commands by waving your hand over the phone. We expect Google to dive into more detail surrounding that feature, as it\u2019s something that other phones don\u2019t have.\n\nThere could be a load of other announcements. In fact, we\u2019re expecting a new Pixelbook, possibly some new Pixel Buds headphones, Nest products, and more. The Verge\u2019s Jay Peters has everything we expect to see all in one place.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find everything we know, a staggering mix of news, rumors, and more.", "description": "There have been plenty of leaks, but Google will take the wraps off of its new hardware at an event on Tuesday, October 15th at 10AM ET.
