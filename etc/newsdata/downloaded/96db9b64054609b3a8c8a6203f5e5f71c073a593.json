won the World Cup.\n\nBut England are attempting to do something that has never been done before in win a World Cup by beating the four biggest southern hemisphere side\u2019s in a row, having already seen off Argentina, Australia and New Zealand, and it would perhaps eclipse what the great All Blacks team of 2015 achieved in defeating both Rugby Championship rivals South Africa and Australia after a quarter-final victory over France, having also beaten the Pumas in the pool stage.\n\nIreland will finish the year ranked fifth in the world no matter what happens in the Wales vs New Zealand match, with Australia sixth and France seventh. Japan has momentarily moved to an all-time high of sixth following the Wallabies\u2019 defeat against England in the quarter-finals, but the joy did not last as the World Cup hosts were knocked out themselves the following day along with the French, dropping them back behind the Australians.\n\nHowever, Japan will record an end-of-year high in eighth place, ahead of both Scotland and Argentina.\n\nCurrent World Rugby rankings", "description": "England\u00a0are on top of the World Rugby rankings for the first time in 15 years, with their victory over New Zealand\u00a0last weekend ahead of what is arguably the biggest week in the team\u2019s history.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/26/12/Eddie-Jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
