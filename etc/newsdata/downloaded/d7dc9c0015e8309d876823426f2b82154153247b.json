If it was my child I would be so angry and I know sorry doesn't cut it, but there is nothing else that I can say,\" she said.\n\nThe manner in which she raised Ninow was put in the spotlight after he testified that it was his mother who introduced him to drugs and alcohol when he was 13 years old.\n\n\n\nREAD: Ninow shirks responsibility, blaming drugs for rape of child\n\nNinow told the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria that his addiction journey started when he and a friend visited his mother. Chantelle Ninow let the two minors drink alcohol and later made them snort the drug CAT to sober up, the court heard.\n\nThe evidence was brought up when Ninow and his grandmother, Pauline Gericke, were testifying in mitigation of his sentence earlier in October.\n\nBoth of them blamed the drugs for his mental state on the day.\n\nANALYSIS | Nicholas Ninow's contradictions and final attempt to escape a life sentence\n\nIn the interview, his mother apologised to the 7-year-old victim and said she could have helped Ninow who was high on drugs shortly before he raped the little girl in the bathroom of a Dros restaurant in Pretoria in 2018.\n\n\"I will always carry that guilt. To think that my son is in jail, to think that \u2026 to think that that night I could have done something for him, but I didn't. I can't take it back, there is nothing I can do.
