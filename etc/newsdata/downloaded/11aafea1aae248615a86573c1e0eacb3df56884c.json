As the Republican faces the prospect of presidential impeachment, Trump\u2019s attention is now turning to Capitol Hill, where he expects his partisan allies to do what he cannot: make his crisis go away.\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump turned to Twitter to ask, \u201c[W]hen do the Republicans finally fight back?\u201d The president didn\u2019t specify what, exactly, he wanted his party to do, though as the New York Times noted, Trump remained focused on this point during an odd White House cabinet meeting yesterday.\n\nMr. Trump, increasingly embittered by the impeachment inquiry, complained on Monday that Republicans were not defending him aggressively enough. \u201cRepublicans have to get tougher and fight,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a rambling, hourlong question-and-answer session with reporters at a cabinet meeting. \u201cWe have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight, because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the election, which is coming up, where we\u2019re doing very well.\u201d\n\nAs part of the same harangue, Trump added, in reference to his Democratic detractors, \u201cI think they\u2019re lousy politicians. But two things they have: They\u2019re vicious and they stick together. They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst. They don\u2019t have people like that. They stick together. You never see them break off.\u201d\n\nFor anyone familiar with Democratic politics, the president\u2019s description of the party seemed rather bizarre, though Trump\u2019s latest complaint about Mitt Romney reflected his ongoing preoccupation with intra-party defections.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising to see Trump demand greater GOP fealty, but what the president doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate is the extent to which he and his White House have made these demands more difficult.\n\nTrump expects congressional Republicans to fight on his behalf, but he\u2019s pushing a policy in Syria that GOP lawmakers hate. Trump expects these Republicans to rescue him, but he briefly touted an indefensible scheme in which he\u2019d host an international gathering at one of his struggling businesses.\n\nTrump expects Republicans to \u201cfight back\u201d against the impeachment process, but he and his team have made that vastly more difficult by releasing incriminating information and, in Mick Mulvaney\u2019s case, practically confessing to wrongdoing.\n\nIn other words, the president is insulting prominent Republicans, taking positions at odds with Republican orthodoxy, and embroiling himself in scandals that Republicans find difficult to defend. Trump is also demanding that Republicans \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d on his behalf.\n\nWhy? In part because he says so, and in part because, as the president reminded Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) last week, Trump considers himself \u201cthe boss.\u201d", "description": "Trump expects his partisan allies to do what he cannot: make his crisis go away.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_mj_second_191018_1920x1080.jpg?itok=NH_oyBIu", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
