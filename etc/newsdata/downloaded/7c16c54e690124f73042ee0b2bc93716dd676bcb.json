This led to Aela\u2019s suspensions along with two other currently unnamed students who were also suspended for similar notes.\n\nAela\u2019s claims the note wasn\u2019t calling out a specific student but the environment of the school itself.\n\n\u201cThe sticky note was meant to target the culture that we have in our school. There are definitely multiple cases and perpetrators in mind, but there\u2019s not one in particular despite what everyone seems to think,\u201d she said.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Maine \u2014 who has taken on Aela\u2019s case \u2014 requested a temporary restraining order Sunday against the school district, saying she was raising awareness in her school about sexual assault and is protected under the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cThis case is really important to make sure that when people raise those issues, when students raise those issues, that they don\u2019t feel silenced, and they instead feel supported,\u201d said Alison Beyea, ACLU of Maine\u2019s executive director.\n\nSuperintendent Donna Wolfrom reportedly declined to comment, citing the matter is currently in court.\n\nAela has offered no apologies and plans to still advocate for sexual assault victims.\n\n\u201cI think anyone that has experienced any sort of sexual violence or harassment is especially vulnerable when they are going through their healing process, and to have an ally who is willing to advocate for that, I think is crucial and beneficial,\u201d she said, The Associated Press reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
