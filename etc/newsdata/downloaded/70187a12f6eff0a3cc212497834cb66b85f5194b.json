Once people know where they stand, they can then take the necessary steps to increase their credit score and build a better credit profile.\n\nWhen customers have an improved credit rating and score, they are able to get better deals on all types of credit. This in turn means more interest-free offers, lower APRs and greater choice.\n\nCustomers can then get a mobile phone contract or perhaps spread the cost of big items over a number of months, including purchases such as furniture or a new car.\n\nAlastair Douglas, CEO of credit experts TotallyMoney, said: 'The extra fees people pay for having a bad credit score are huge. Taking the time to check their report means they can understand why this might be happening.\n\n'Lenders review a customer's credit report when they apply for a product. With a bad score, they're more likely to charge a higher APR, offer less interest-free months, or even reject an application.\n\n'Being informed about their score can help people to see where to improve and how to get the best deals. A report shows customers up to six years of credit history, and how much credit they are currently using.\n\n'At TotallyMoney, we're on a mission to improve the UK's credit score. Checking a report is the first step of this process and can help people to understand their score. With this, they can get better rates and more choice \u2014 helping them work towards a better financial future.'", "description": "Paying a \u00a33,000 credit card bill over two years could cost \u00a31,979 more in interest to an appliccant with a bad credit rating, according to data from TotallyMoney and Moneycomms.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
