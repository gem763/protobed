Pieters suggested Weber really merits a non-jail sentence involving probation and community service.\n\nJudge Malcolm McLeod is scheduled to pass sentence on Oct. 28.\n\nLong criminal record\n\nThe Securities Act conviction is just the latest in a long line of infractions for Weber, a native of the Windsor, Ont. area. His 43-count criminal record, filed in court, stretches back to 1997 and ranges from assault to fraudulent personation, driving while under a court ban, mischief and operating an illegal cannabis grow-op.\n\nIn 2001, he was convicted for his role in a headline-grabbing scheme to counterfeit $100 bills that prosecutors claimed was a reason many businesses in southern Ontario stopped accepting the bills. The Bank of Canada calls him \"one of the most well-known counterfeiters in Canada in recent years.\"\n\nWeber's spouse, real estate broker Michelle Kam, told the court Monday that he is a 'kind man,' and a 'great father.' (LinkedIn)\n\nWeber has used at least three different aliases over the years. The agreed statement of facts from his guilty plea says he went by the name \"Wesley Kam\" while running a digital currency company called Incryptex, \"so that he could operate Incryptex without his past being known.\"\n\nWeber's latest venture has been CAFE, or Cannabis and Fine Edibles, a chain of four sleek Toronto coffee shops that double as unlicensed marijuana dispensaries.\n\nCo-founded in 2016 by lifelong friend and fellow Windsor-area native Jon Galvano, CAFE gained a loyal following in Toronto as it bucked more than a dozen police and bylaw enforcement attempts to shut down its stores. Officers would raid them and then weld the doors shut or pile up huge cement blocks outside to block entry. But often within hours, the locations would reopen.\n\nCAFE landlords face up to $3.6M in total fines\n\nCAFE came up in court on Monday when retired RCMP sergeant Steve Han, who led the Ontario Securities Commission investigation into Weber, testified about efforts to discover his role in the chain of pot shops.\n\n\"I observed Mr. Weber inside the business, seated inside by the window, and I didn't observe him doing anything,\" Han said of a visit to CAFE's location on Toronto's Fort York Blvd. on Aug. 21, 2018.\n\n\"I reattended that business, and spoke to the same female host there, and she told me that Mr. Weber was the owner.\"\n\nCAFE's locations have mostly been barricaded shut by law enforcement since July, but a number of them continued to sell cannabis from out front.\n\nThe City of Toronto has tried to shut down CAFE's locations by blocking them off with cement slabs, but the company set up chairs and canopies in front of a number of locations to continue to sell cannabis. (Chris Glover/CBC)\n\nThe landlords of the four Toronto locations have been charged with a total of 11 counts under Ontario's Cannabis Control Act, under the section making it illegal to \"knowingly permit a premises of which he or she is a landlord to be used in relation to\" unlawful sale or distribution of cannabis. The maximum total penalty they could face would be $3.6 million.\n\nThose landlords include Ali Gillani, who was at one point the chief operating officer and a director of Weber's company Incryptex \u2014 the very company that got him in trouble with the Ontario Securities Commission.\n\nGillani did not return a call or email earlier this summer seeking comment.\n\nCAFE co-founder Jon Galvano, left, and Weber are seen 'flying to a meeting in Windsor' in a photo posted to Galvano's Instagram feed in January. (j.galvano/Instagram)\n\nAnother CAFE landlord is a federally registered numbered company, 10956392 Canada Inc. Weber's spouse, real estate broker Michelle Kam, filed the incorporation papers and signed property records for the corporation and is also named as the guarantor on its $1.7-million mortgage. Until February, she was the company's only director.\n\nKam was deeply involved in Incryptex and testified in court Monday for Weber's defence, saying he's a \"kind man, a great father, he's very active, he's a great guy.\"\n\nHave a tip on this or any other story?
