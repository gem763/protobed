Police in Lancaster are investigating the shooting at the Old Skool Sports Bar & Grill at about 2:45 a.m.\n\nTwo adult males were shot and killed. Four injured victims were airlifted to medical facilities for treatment. The other four people were treated at local facilities for injuries considered noncritical.\n\nAn eleventh victim was treated and released for minor injuries incurred after falling while trying to flee. The victims' identities were not released.\n\nThe Lancaster County Sheriff's Office said authorities were not sure whether more than one person fired a weapon. Investigators have some information about a possible suspect but no arrests have been made.\n\n\"This was a violent incident of huge magnitude that was witnessed by lots of people,\" Sheriff Barry Faile said in a statement. \"The shooter or shooters are out there. We need to talk with everybody who was at the club when the shooting happened, and I encourage those witnesses to contact us immediately so those responsible for these deaths and injuries can be taken into custody.\"\n\n\"I don't think most of these people were intended victims,\" Faile said, according to CBS affiliate WLTX. \"A lot of them were at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\nThe statement said a large crowd was at the bar when the shooting occurred and that shots were fired inside and outside the bar. Most patrons scattered as shots were fired and afterward.", "description": "Police in Lancaster are investigating the shooting at the Old Skool Sports Bar & Grill", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/21/39d7a3c3-c5d6-4781-93fc-1b2b6317d3d3/thumbnail/1200x630/c4febc0d5712acb549d1937e3aefa0a8/screen-shot-2019-09-21-at-3-27-52-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
