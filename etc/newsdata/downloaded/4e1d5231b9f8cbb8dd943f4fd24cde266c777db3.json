The last CNN 2020 New Hampshire Primary Poll in mid-July, conducted by Smith and his colleagues at the University of New Hampshire, found that 61 percent of likely Democratic primary voters were undecided and another 20 percent were leaners.\n\nEven so, the TV networks\u2014and too many of my print colleagues\u2014would rather ballyhoo the shallow preferences of voters who are, in truth, still undecided than admit how much of the 2020 campaign is still in flux. CBS News has even gone to absurd lengths to predict the results; it is peddling an exclusive convention delegate tracker, which uses the current evanescent poll numbers to estimate where candidates will stand after the first 18 primaries and caucuses in February and early March are finished.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the impatient hucksters at CBS? Announcing the vice-presidential nominee next week and laying out the 2021 cabinet by Halloween?\n\nThe secret of winning a presidential nomination\u2014or coming tantalizingly close\u2014lies in peaking at the right moment. Kathy Sullivan, the former chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party who is still (\u201cmy list is down to seven\u201d) undecided, said, \u201cEveryone I talk to about Booker asks, \u2018When\u2019s he going to pop?\u2019 But it\u2019s a lot better to pop in January than to pop in August.\u201d\n\n\n\nFormer Colorado Senator Gary Hart is the enduring example of an out-of-nowhere Democratic candidate roaring to victory in the New Hampshire primary by upending a popular, but less than charismatic, former vice president. The year was 1984 and the esteemed ex-V.P. was Walter Mondale.\n\nBoth men are wading into the presidential race this cycle. Mondale has endorsed Klobuchar, who hails from his home state, and with a perfect sense of timing and poetry, Bennet brought the 82-year-old Hart, now blessed with flowing white hair, to New Hampshire to campaign with him over the weekend. As Hart said to about 100 would-be Bennet supporters after the convention this past weekend, \u201cWhat was accomplished here by a not very well-known senator is one of the great upsets in political history.\u201d\n\nIn 1984, I covered that race as the lead political writer for Newsweek, which in those days went to press on a Saturday night. The weekend before the primary, I wrote, \u201cMondale\u2019s lead in New Hampshire appears unassailable.\u201d By Tuesday, with my cocksure prediction sitting in subscribers\u2019 mailboxes, the network exit polls had leaked. They correctly showed Hart winning the state by a double-digit margin. As I arrived at my hotel (the late-lamented Sheraton Wayfarer), the first person I saw was a colleague from a rival magazine. His opening words have stayed with me these last 35 years: \u201cYou blew it.\u201d That mortifying moment has shaped the way I cover politics to this day, and my fellow journalists could learn from it.\n\nAt a Saturday press conference before the state convention, I asked Hart how he kept going in early 1984 as his chances were widely belittled by journalists like me.\n\n\u201cWith fortitude,\u201d he replied with a laugh, before adding, \u201cSeeking the presidency of the United States is one of the most difficult projects that any human being\u2014man or woman\u2014can undertake. It takes more physical, mental, spiritual determination than almost any other project that anyone can undertake. If you don\u2019t have that, you shouldn\u2019t be in the race.\u201d\n\nPatience and Fortitude are the names of the two stone lions in front of the New York Public Library. They are also the qualities that the press corps\u2014as well as candidates like Bennet, Booker, and Klobuchar\u2014will need in abundance to cover the confounding 2020 primary race in Iowa, New Hampshire, and beyond.", "description": "Do Klobuchar, Booker, and Bennet have a shot in hell at the nomination?", "authors": ["Walter Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/4a143d41182d66fbce2cb1258d01c3aca157caeb.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
