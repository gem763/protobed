There\u2019s no excuses \u2014 we\u2019ve just got to concentrate more and take our opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe hulking Petaia, Australia\u2019s youngest ever World Cup player at 19, impressed against Uruguay, crashing over for one try and creating another.\n\nCheika also moved To\u2019omua from inside centre to fly-half, where he will link up with scrum-half Nic White for the first time, making it the 11th half-back pairing used by Australia since the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\u2013 Truth or perception \u2013\n\n\u201cConsistency is probably something that\u2019s eluded us over the last few years,\u201d admitted Cheika, ahead of his country\u2019s first-ever Test against Georgia.\n\n\u201cBut I still believe we can get better. The competition (for places) is sparking the players to want to do better. You see that really well between the half-backs.\u201d\n\nAustralia \u2014 who captured the second of their two world titles in 1999 \u2014 beat Fiji 39-21 in their opening fixture before losing 29-25 to Wales and thrashing Uruguay 45-10.\n\nThe Wallabies coach called for his side to be more clinical.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not capitalising on opportunities,\u201d said Cheika. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to concentrate and stay in the moment.\u201d\n\nUp front, prop Sekope Kepu becomes only the sixth player to win 110 caps for Australia, who have been working on avoiding high tackles after coming under scrutiny in their first two games.\n\n\u201cOne of the huge things that\u2019s hurt us is penalties snuffing out our momentum,\u201d said Cheika, who, already seething over a three-match ban on winger Reece Hodge after Australia\u2019s win over Fiji, raged against the World Cup refereeing following defeat by Wales.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go there targeting zero in that area.\u201d\n\nAsked about the World Cup\u2019s crackdown on high tackles, Cheika added: \u201cNo matter how you see the pictures, the penalties are real. Whether truth or perception, we are getting the arm raised against us and getting players sent to the bench. It\u2019s a reality \u2014 we\u2019ve got to deal with it.\u201d\n\nAustralia (15-1):\n\nKurtley Beale; Jordan Petaia, James O\u2019Connor, Samu Kerevi, Marika Koroibete; Matt To\u2019omua, Nic White; Isi Naisarani, David Pocock (capt), Jack Dempsey; Rory Arnold, Izack Rodda; Sekope Kepu, Tolu Latu, Scott Sio\n\nReplacements:\n\nJordan Uelese, James Slipper, Taniela Tupou, Adam Coleman, Michael Hooper, Will Genia, Christian Lealiifano, Dane Haylett-Petty", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Tinkering Australia coach Michael Cheika has made wholesale changes to his side to face Georgia on Friday, resting captain Michael", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/b0ec24_michael-hooper-on-bench-georgia-game-pooper-cut-as-aussies-ring-georgia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
