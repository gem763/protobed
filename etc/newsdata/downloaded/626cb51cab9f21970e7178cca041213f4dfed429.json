She was a Green Party spokeswoman in Arizona at age 25. In the early 2000s, she organized more than a dozen anti-war protests. She has engaged with farther left figures, including a radio host who eventually became known in the 9/11 truther movement.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to delegitimize Sinema\u2019s current stances, but to trace Sinema\u2019s path to the center, which represents something of a feat. Indeed, her shift from the farther side of the spectrum towards the center may offer guidance\u2014and consolation\u2014to those within the Democratic Party who fear alienating the progressive wing. Her story reveals that such a shift can be done, but at a certain cost, apparently.\n\nThe backlash against Sinema provides a window into the state of leftist orthodoxy and why it\u2019s important to acknowledge those who forge their own political paths. When criticizing Sinema, O\u2019Neal explained that the purpose of the censure was to alter her voting patterns. \u201cThe way she is voting is really disappointing. We want Democrats to vote like Democrats and not Republicans.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Erielle Davidson", "Thefederalist.Com Censure-Vote-Against-Kyrsten-Sinema-Is-Why-We-Cant-Have-Nice-Things"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
