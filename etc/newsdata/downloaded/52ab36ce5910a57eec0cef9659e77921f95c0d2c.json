Another village, Tel Fander, was also in the militant group\u2019s control, the Anadolu news agency said.\n\nThe SDF claimed to be successfully repelling Turkish troops from entering at least two other towns. The Turkish ministry of defence said on Thursday morning it had achieved its targets so far. \u201cOperation continues successfully as planned,\u201d it tweeted.\n\nSyria: Erdo\u011fan's eyes more likely to be on Putin than Trump Read more\n\nTurkish troops crossed the border into north-eastern Syria on Wednesday evening after an earlier barrage of airstrikes and artillery signalled the beginning of a long-planned operation to establish a 20-mile buffer zone between the two countries. The Turkish military later said it had hit 181 \u201cmilitant targets\u201d.\n\nVideo footage showed civilians fleeing towns with columns of smoke rising in the background and jet trails visible in the sky. Kurdish activist groups estimated tens of thousands of civilians had fled their homes after the beginning of the Turkish offensive.\n\nErdo\u011fan said on Thursday his troops had killed 109 SDF fighters. The SDF operations centre had earlier put the casualty figure at three fighters and eight civilians. Local humanitarian groups said another 25 civilians had been injured. Pictures and video from border towns shared on social media showed wrecked buildings and bodies in the rubble.\n\nTurkey\u2019s offensive was triggered by a call between Donald Trump and Erdo\u011fan on Sunday, in which, the Turks claim, Trump handed over leadership of the campaign against Isis in Syria to Ankara. The American president announced on Sunday night that US troops would withdraw from the region.\n\nG\u00fclnur Aybet, one of the Turkish president\u2019s senior advisers, told CNN: \u201cPresident Trump and President Erdo\u011fan have reached an understanding over precisely what this operation is.\u201d Aybet added that Trump \u201cknows what the scope of this operation is\u201d.\n\nHours after the bombing began, Trump issued a statement mildly criticising the offensive aimed at Kurdish forces, which for nearly five years fought alongside the US against Isis.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\u201d the statement said, before noting: \u201cThere are no American soldiers in the area.\u201d\n\nWhat is the situation in north-eastern Syria?

And he downplayed the US debt to Kurdish fighters, saying: \u201cThey didn\u2019t help us in the second world war, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy \u2026 but they\u2019re there to help us with their land.\u201d\n\nHe said Isis fighters who escaped Kurdish custody would be \u201cescaping to Europe [\u2026] they want to go back to their homes\u201d.\n\nTrump tweeted on Thursday morning that ahead of the Turkish offensive the US had extricated from Kurdish custody two Isis detainees who were members of \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, a gang of four jailers who were allegedly responsible for the torture and beheading of prisoners, including the American photojournalist James Foley.\n\nThe UN security council is due to convene on Thursday to discuss the offensive at the request of its five current European members, but it is not expected to deliver a strong rebuke to Turkey, given tacit Russian support and US ambivalence.\n\nTurkey says it is seeking to establish a 20-mile (32km) wide buffer zone along the border against the threat of what it says are Kurdish terror groups as well as Isis. It also hopes to resettle Syrian refugees in the zone.", "description": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan warns he will \u2018open the gates\u2019 if Syria assault is called an \u2018occupation\u2019", "authors": ["Michael Safi", "Bethan Mckernan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f892bf2038ea05e2ee72fdd40253fc03c5bd439d/62_316_2613_1568/master/2613.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=25377a4cedf859ef0e6277b1e6d27f21", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
