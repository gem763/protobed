According to the justice ministry, 132,226 people of Sephardic descent applied for Spanish citizenship before the deadline, with a huge rise in applications in the past month.\n\n\u201cBy 31 August, 60,226 applications had been received, but in September alone, almost 72,000 were received, most of them from citizens in Latin American countries, mainly Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe Spanish government had initially estimated that around 90,000 people would seek citizenship, but acknowledged that it was hard to know just how many people would meet the criteria.\n\nSpain\u2019s Federation of Jewish Communities (FCJE), which certifies applications, said it had received more than 30,000 from Mexico, 26,000 from Colombia, 14,000 from Venezuela, 7,000 from Argentina, 5,400 from the US and 4,900 from Israel.\n\nIt has also dealt with applications from Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Turkey, France, the UK, Serbia and Montenegro, Peru, Chile, Morocco and Afghanistan.\n\nAlthough the process does not require applicants to be practising Jews or to be resident in Spain, it is long, complicated and expensive.\n\nAs well as taking tests in Spanish language and culture, applicants needed to prove their Sephardic heritage, establish or prove a special connection with Spain, and then pay a designated notary to certify their documents.\n\nIsaac Querub, the president of the FCJE, said the law had finally achieved its aims.\n\n\u201cThousands of Sephardic Jews from all over the world have recovered their Spanish nationality and thousands more are in the process of doing so,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSpain has used a long-lasting legal act to close a historical wound. Sephardic Jews are no longer \u2018the Jews without a homeland\u2019. Spain came to miss them and the Sephardic Jews never forgot Spain.\u201d\n\nA similar law was approved in Portugal in 2015 to atone for the expulsions from that part of the Iberian peninsula.\n\n\u201cThere is no possibility to amend what was done,\u201d the Portuguese government said at the time, adding that the law represented \u201can attribution of a right\u201d.\n\nBrexit has fuelled a huge increase in the number of applications for Portuguese citizenship.\n\nThe Jewish Community of Oporto \u2013 which, along with the Lisbon Jewish community, certifies applicants \u2013 said it had received just five applications before the Brexit referendum compared with 400 in the two months following the vote.\n\nThe Jewish Federation of New Mexico also recorded a spike in applications following the election of Donald Trump as president.\n\n\u201cBefore the election, we issued maybe 20 or 30 certificates,\u201d Sara Koplik, the federation\u2019s director of community outreach, told the Guardian last year.\n\n\u201cBut we have now issued 1,500 \u2013 from multiple countries.\u201d\n\nWhile the federation has dealt with applications from more than 50 countries, the majority come from the US, Mexico and Venezuela.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big jump and of course some of it had nothing to do with the United States \u2013 it has to do with Venezuela and violence in Mexico \u2013 but for Americans, they see this as an insurance policy just in case, against hatred,\u201d said Koplik.", "description": "Application deadline passes under law designed to atone for 15th-century \u2018historical wrong\u2019", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e15a57085062d6817a6fc656302d890a5d809b9/0_32_5945_3568/master/5945.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=937fbc51a57a2ae4082b5aa8fbddad4c"}
