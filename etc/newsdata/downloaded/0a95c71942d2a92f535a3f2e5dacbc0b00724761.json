Sales of new energy vehicles contracted for a second month in a row in August, and are likely to grow at a slower pace this year to 1.5 million vehicles, down from a previous forecast of 1.6 million, according to an industry association.\n\nTesla has fared better, with China sales rising 98% in the first seven months of this year thanks to strong demand for Model 3, according to research firm LMC Automotive.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW PHASE\n\nTesla has embarked on a new phase of construction work at the factory in a sign of confidence in its China strategy. The new facilities will include battery pack production units, according to a company source and documents.\n\nThe so-called 1.5-phase works, which have not previously been reported, include a production workshop and an energy center, construction documents showed. Construction is scheduled for completion by around the end of this year.\n\nTesla also is looking to hire battery-related production engineers in Shanghai, according to its job advertisements.\n\nThe plant, which Tesla says will be simplified and more cost-effective than its existing Model 3 line, will have 500,000 units of annual capacity when the second phase is completed, doubling from initial phase capacity of 250,000 vehicles.\n\nThe factory, China's first fully foreign-owned car plant, is a reflection of Beijing's broader shift to open up its car market.\n\nShanghai authorities have offered assistance to speed up construction, and China excluded Tesla models from a 10% car purchase tax on Aug. 30.\n\nState partners of the Tesla project include Shanghai Construction Group <600170.SS>, China Construction Industrial & Energy Engineering Group, State Grid [STGRD.UL], Power Construction Corporation of China <601669.SS>, and MinMetals' [CHMIN.UL] Shanghai unit Baoye, according to multiple sources involved in the construction project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Yilei Sun and John Ruwitch in Shanghai; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Stephen Coates)", "description": "Tesla Inc's  China factory aims to start production this month but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
