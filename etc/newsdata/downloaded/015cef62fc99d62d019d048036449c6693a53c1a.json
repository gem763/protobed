Same for those in charge at Major League Baseball.\n\nPlay fair. Be nice. And when you make a mistake, apologize.\n\nAs they prepared for Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night, the Astros and MLB were engulfed in a debacle solely of their own creation. Displaying the toxic arrogance that is fast becoming their trademark, the Astros first called a Sports Illustrated reporter a liar for her story on assistant general manager Brandon Taubman taunting female reporters with his praise of a pitcher suspended for beating up the mother of his child, then issuing a non-apology apology that included the infuriating and condescending \u201cif anyone was offended\u201d phrase.\n\nRather than taking a hard line on a franchise that has made boorishness a core value, MLB issued a statement that both sides-ed the issue and then ran for cover.\n\nOutstanding role models all around. But hey! The World Series is about to start, and all will be forgiven if the Astros win their second title in three years.\n\nAt least Houston manager A.J. Hinch was mature enough to say that none of this was acceptable, without any qualifiers.\n\n\"It's uncalled for,\" Hinch said. \"No one should ever feel like, when you come into our clubhouse, that you're going to be uncomfortable or disrespected.\n\n\"We all need to be better across the board in the industry,\" Hinch added. \"I understand why it\u2019s a question today. I appreciate it. I was disappointed.\"\n\nDisappointed, infuriated, exhausted -- take your pick of emotions and any one of them is justified. There is so much wrong about what happened in the Astros\u2019 clubhouse Saturday night, as well as the team\u2019s defiant defense of it, and it is inexcusable that that still has to be explained.\n\nOPINION: Red, white and new: Nationals rule October in D.C.\n\nLONG LAYOFF: World Series history doesn't favor Nationals\n\nPITCH TIPPING: Why paranoia may consume this World Series\n\nSI reported Monday night that Taubman repeatedly shouted \u201cThank God we got (Roberto) Osuna! I\u2019m so (expletive) glad we got Osuna!\u201d in the direction of three female reporters after Houston beat the New York Yankees to reach the World Series.\n\nOsuna was suspended for 75 games in 2018 for violating MLB\u2019s domestic violence policy. SI reported that one of the journalists Taubman yelled at was wearing a purple bracelet for domestic violence awareness.\n\nThe Astros\u2019 first instinct, to lie and smear the SI reporter, failed miserably when others stepped forward to corroborate the account.\n\n\u201cI was there. Saw it. And I should\u2019ve said something sooner,\u201d Hunter Atkins, a reporter for the Houston Chronicle, said said on Twitter. The Chronicle later published a story saying three eyewitnesses, two of whom were its own reporters, had confirmed SI\u2019s account.\n\nOnly after widespread criticism, by people inside baseball and out, did Taubman and the Astros make a show of remorse.\n\nAnd a show it was, with Taubman saying his support of Osuna had been \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d for willful ignorance about \u201ca social issue.\u201d Why, he\u2019s a \u201cloving and committed husband and father\u201d! \u2013 as if no husband or father has ever been ill-informed about domestic violence or has marginalized women.\n\n\u201cI hope that those who do not know me understand that the Sports Illustrated article does not reflect who I am or my values,\u201d Taubman said in his statement. \u201cI am sorry if anyone was offended by my actions.\u201d\n\nWhen there\u2019s an \u201cif\u201d in an apology, it\u2019s not an apology. People were offended by Taubman\u2019s actions, and rightly so.\n\nOsuna has been a member of the Astros since late last season, and Taubman decided Saturday night was when he should decree what a swell pickup the closer was? And he just happened to direct it to a group of female reporters?\n\nNo. Taubman was letting them know that the lives and safety of women are irrelevant when someone can throw 90-plus mph in the ninth inning.\n\nThe statement from Astros chairman Jim Crane wasn\u2019t any more sincere, saying that the team is \u201ccommitted to using our voice to create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence.\u201d Given the circumstances, Crane probably ought to have chosen his words better.\n\nAs for MLB, it chose to hide behind an \u201cinvestigation,\u201d saying SI and the Astros have different versions of Saturday night\u2019s events. Given that Taubman has now acknowledged the SI report was correct, MLB might want to take another crack at this.\n\nThere is a conversation to be had about Taubman\u2019s behavior and baseball\u2019s continued apathy about domestic violence. But the larger problem right now is that the Astros are operating under their own rules, and they don\u2019t much care what anyone thinks of that.\n\nEarlier this season, a petulant Justin Verlander demanded a reporter he didn\u2019t like be barred from the clubhouse until he was done talking. Rather than patiently explaining the role of the news media and why MLB has deemed it important enough to include in the collective bargaining agreement, the Astros kowtowed to their ace and, without any evidence, disparaged the reporter Verlander found so bothersome.\n\nMLB let the Astros know they were in the wrong. But Taubman\u2019s behavior, and the team\u2019s defiant absolution of it, shows the Astros think they can bully people without consequence. And, so far, they\u2019re right.\n\nTeams are given wide latitude in their operations, and rightly so. But when they traffic in misinformation and misogyny, or create a hostile environment for reporters, it is incumbent upon the league to step in.\n\nIf MLB isn't up to it, or doesn't recognize why the Astros' behavior is unacceptable, perhaps they should defer to the experts. I'm sure there are some Little League players out there who would be happy to explain.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "description": "An Astros executive shouted vulgar praise for Roberto Osuna, pitcher banned for domestic abuse, toward female reporters.
