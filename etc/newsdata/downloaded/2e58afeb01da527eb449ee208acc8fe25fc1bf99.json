Over the course of a week, he started feeling a little breathless during his morning commutes to University College London and had what felt like muscle aches around his upper back and shoulders. He put the symptoms down to a nasty virus. \u201cI was 31,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy on earth would I suspect that I was having a heart attack?\u201d\n\nAs the days passed, his symptoms grew more pronounced. Eventually, he woke on a Saturday morning to \u201cthe most intense pain I\u2019ve ever experienced \u2013 an otherworldly, constant stabbing pressure in the collarbone area, neck and jaw, on both sides\u201d. He started coughing and vomiting, but there were no chest pains. \u201cI\u2019m not a religious man, but I remember praying at one point.\u201d After no more than 10 minutes, the symptoms went away, just as suddenly as they had appeared. He assumed it was a really nasty bug. Later, he became feverish and decided \u201cto take a few days off uni to get my strength back\u201d.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he was sitting at his desk the following Thursday, more than a week after symptoms had begun, that he sought medical attention. \u201cMy left arm suddenly went cold and numb.\u201d He walked to the nearest A&E, where he was examined by a flurry of bemused doctors. Before the day was out, he had been diagnosed with a heart attack and undergone emergency surgery. An artery had been blocked and needed two stents to re-open it.\n\nWhile Walker\u2019s age was an additional red herring (the British Heart Foundation estimates that the chance of a 31-year-old having a heart attack is 0.02%), the slow onset of these easily misinterpreted symptoms is surprisingly common \u2013 yet little known. A recent US study published in the European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing found that, while 57% of patients reported an \u201cabrupt symptom onset\u201d, the other 43% experienced \u201cgradual symptom onset\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fully recovered ...

However, those with a gradual onset of symptoms experienced, on average, eight-hour delays in getting life-saving treatment.\n\nThe study highlights the need for greater public education, says Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, the medical director of the British Heart Foundation. But even people in the medical profession can be misled. \u201cI know doctors who have put their own heart attacks down to indigestion and gone to bed for a while. Sometimes if you\u2019re having a heart attack you feel you want to be sick \u2013 they think it\u2019s all to do with what they might have eaten. These are features that sometimes delay diagnosis.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s case is unusual not only because of his age, says Samani, who is also a consultant cardiologist at Glenfield hospital in Leicester, but because of the duration of his symptoms, even for a slow-onset attack. \u201cUsually, it doesn\u2019t go on for a few days, but several hours, as opposed to a \u2018big bang\u2019 heart attack when within a few moments you know something has changed.\u201d\n\nSudden heart attacks occur because an artery is completely blocked. However, Samani says this is one end of a spectrum of possibilities. \u201cThe reason you get a heart attack is that the inner lining of the artery breaks down, which exposes the underlying cholesterol plaque to the flowing blood, allowing a clot to form which blocks the artery.\u201d In gradual heart attacks, he says, the artery is only partially blocked, \u201cbut then the clot might go downstream and block a smaller artery, so many can feel chest pain and then it settles as the clot breaks down and breaks away\u201d. An ECG machine may not detect anything wrong, further delaying treatment.\n\nApart from acute chest pains and sharp arm pain (usually in the left arm), symptoms include \u201cchest tightness, tingling fingers, jaw pain, stomach or back pain, breathlessness and indigestion\u201d, according to Philippa Hobson, a senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation. It may seem bizarre to feel pain in seemingly unrelated places, says Samani, but \u201cthe nerves that send heart pain to the brain also supply the jaw and the left arm and so on\u201d \u2013 the brain can\u2019t distinguish where it is coming from. The advice is to call 999 or an ambulance. \u201cParticularly as you get older, err on the side of caution,\u201d Samani says.\n\nHowever, even if you are armed with the symptom list, if you are not expecting a heart attack, you, or a doctor, will be likely to attribute experiencing any of them to another illness, or even a panic attack. The thing to look out for, Samani says, is something you have never felt before. Walker says that, when his arm went numb, \u201cit was distinctive and felt alien. We\u2019ve all had our arm go to sleep now and then. It wasn\u2019t like that. It felt as if I didn\u2019t have an arm any more.\u201d\n\nHowever, even as he was being transferred to another hospital for surgery, having had an aspirin and some rest, he was surprised at how well he felt. \u201cI was starting to feel embarrassed, expecting they were going to take me there with all this fanfare and it would just be indigestion,\u201d he says. But if he hadn\u2019t visited A&E when he did, \u201cI probably would have gone into cardiac arrest\u201d.\n\nDoctors still don\u2019t know what caused Walker\u2019s heart attack. He doesn\u2019t smoke or take drugs, although his BMI at the time was just within the obese range. Since his recovery, he has lost 25kg (4st) and taken up cycling. He considers surviving his heart attack \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to me\u201d.", "description": "We think of an attack as a \u2018big bang\u2019, but the symptoms can build over hours or days \u2013 and even doctors can misinterpret them", "authors": ["Amy Fleming"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7be9eafadf44221235205c68fbdc1d72a463c3a/677_640_4488_2694/master/4488.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=360a7257eba69d353b5ae97c32d5c1a5", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
