It was like him. It was packed with the razzle-dazzle and action and violence that captivated him. He dreamed of going to Hollywood, then he shelved those dreams in favor of his father\u2019s business and vowed, according to the book \u201cTrumpNation\u201d by Timothy O\u2019Brien, to \u201cput show business into real estate.\u201d\n\nAs TV evolved from the homogeneous three-network mass medium of the mid-20th century to the polarized zillion-channel era of cable-news fisticuffs and reality shocker-tainment, he evolved with it. In the 1980s, he built a media profile as an insouciant, high-living apex predator. In 1990, he described his yacht and gilded buildings to Playboy as \u201cProps for the show \u2026 The show is \u2018Trump\u2019 and it is sold-out performances everywhere.\u201d\n\nHe syndicated that show to Oprah, Letterman, NBC, WrestleMania and Fox News. Everything he achieved, he achieved by using TV as a magnifying glass, to make himself appear bigger than he was.\n\nHe was able to do this because he thought like a TV camera. He knew what TV wanted, what stimulated its nerve endings. In his campaign rallies, he would tell The Washington Post, he knew just what to say \u201cto keep the red light on\u201d: that is, the light on a TV camera that showed that it was running, that you mattered. Bomb the [redacted] out of them! I\u2019d like to punch him in the face! The red light radiated its approval. Cable news aired the rallies start to finish. For all practical purposes, he and the camera shared the same brain.\n\nEven when he adopted social media, he used it like TV. First, he used it like a celebrity, to broadcast himself, his first tweet in 2009 promoting a \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d appearance. Then he used it like an instigator, tweeting his birther conspiracies before he would talk about them on Fox News, road-testing his call for a border wall during the cable-news fueled Ebola and border panics of the 2014 midterms.\n\nWhen he was a candidate, and especially when he was president, his tweets programmed TV and were amplified by it. On CNBC, a \u201cBREAKING NEWS: TRUMP TWEET\u201d graphic would spin out onscreen as soon as the words left his thumbs. He would watch Fox News, or Lou Dobbs, or CNN or \u201cMorning Joe\u201d or \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t watch\u201d), and get mad, and tweet. Then the tweets would become TV, and he would watch it, and tweet again.\n\nIf you want to understand what President Trump will do in any situation, then, it\u2019s more helpful to ask: What would TV do? What does TV want?", "description": "Understand that, and you\u2019ll understand what he\u2019s doing in the White House.", "authors": ["James Poniewozik"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/sunday-review/08poniewozikNEWstill/08poniewozikNEWstill-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
