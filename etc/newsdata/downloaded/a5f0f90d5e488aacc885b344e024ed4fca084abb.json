It was all a bit melodramatic, end of the world, apocalyptic. I wonder the impact she\u2019s now having on young people around the world watching this who must be thinking, \u201cOh my god, the world is literally about to end.\u201d It\u2019s not about to end.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want millions, if not billions, of young people watching Greta do that kind of speech and genuinely think the planet is literally about to end, because it isn\u2019t. So climate change is serious, it should be dealt with, it\u2019s an important issue, but it\u2019s not end of the world stuff in the way she\u2019s portraying it, in my opinion.\u2019\n\nWhen weather woman Laura Tobin explained that Greta isn\u2019t exaggerating the urgency surrounding climate change, the host replied that her \u2018overemotional\u2019 nature made him \u2018uncomfortable\u2019.\n\nHe continued: \u2018It\u2019s an interesting debate. I just feel very uncomfortable that she has got Asperger\u2019s so people who have Asperger\u2019s or families who have people with Asperger\u2019s, they don\u2019t like it being depicted as a mental illness or anything like that. But it is something which does affect the way you perform, behave, react to things.\n\n\u2018And I just watched this and she\u2019s very young, and she seems very overemotional perhaps, maybe rightly as Laura says.\n\n\u2018She is fearless but I\u2019d say I\u2019ve got concerns.\n\n\u2018She has two very politically active parents. It\u2019s if she\u2019s being exploited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They\u2019re driving her as this global figure, is that healthy for her? Should she be back at school?\u2019\n\nThe ITV star isn\u2019t the only famous face chiming into the debate, with Jeremy Clarkson recently going so far as to brand Greta a \u2018spoilt brat\u2019 after she accused politicians of ruining her childhood.\n\nJeremy Clarkson branded the teenager a \u2018spoilt brat\u2019 (Picture: WireImage)\n\nA stance his own daughter called him out for\u2026\n\nSpeaking in his column for The Sun, the 59-year-old ranted: \u2018How dare you sail to America on a carbon fibre yacht that you didn\u2019t build which cost \u00a315million, that you didn\u2019t earn, and which has a back-up diesel engine that you didn\u2019t mention.\n\n\u2018Pause for a moment to consider how soundly you sleep at night, knowing that adults are building and servicing and flying Sweden\u2019s fighter planes. To keep you safe.\n\n\u2018We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all.\n\n\u2018So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.\u2019\n\nJezza acknowledged that something needs to be done over the planet heating up, but suggested the activist should \u2018be a good girl, shut up and let everyone else get on with it\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Because science is what will solve the problem eventually. Not scowling and having screaming ab-dabs every five minutes,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Many thousands of people who you had the temerity to blame this week are trying to do exactly what you want.\n\n\u2018So be a good girl, shut up and let them get on with it.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
