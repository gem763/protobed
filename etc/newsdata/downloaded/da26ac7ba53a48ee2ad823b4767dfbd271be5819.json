Four years ago, Corbyn cheerfully volunteered: \u201cI think we should talk about what the objectives of the party are, whether that\u2019s restoring the Clause IV as it was originally written or it\u2019s a different one, but I think we shouldn\u2019t shy away from public participation, public investment in industry and public control of the railways.\u201d\n\nHowever, there has until now been little real pressure to reinstate the party\u2019s historic constitutional commitment to \u201ccommon ownership\u201d, or nationalisation, muscular as the policies of John McDonnell and Rebecca Long-Bailey may be. It is that constitutional formality that some constituency Labour parties are now hankering after and agitating about. They argue the original, poetic text of Clause IV, dating back to 1918 \u2013 with all the transformative ambition attached to it \u2013 should be restored, like an Edwardian frieze that had been ripped from the facade of a beloved temple by some \u201cmodernising\u201d philistines.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn reality, although Corbyn and the leadership remain sympathetic to a stronger expression of socialist values, for romantic reasons at least, they are disinclined to go back to the antique phrasing of the text adopted more than a century ago, and the wrangling that would go with that. They will instead ask the Webbs\u2019 heirs in various nostalgic CLPs to \u201cremit\u201d their motions. The ever-thorny theological discussion about Clause IV will instead be referred to a working group \u2013 \u201ckicked into the long grass\u201d, to use the common parlance.\n\nEven for Corbyn, trying to restore or redraft Clause IV is a step too far, for now. It is such an exercise in navel-gazing that even he cannot indulge in it, as a difficult general election fast approaches. In practical terms, Labour is already committed to a vast extension of public ownership in larger quoted companies \u2013 up to 10 per cent in due course \u2013 and to taking the railways and other public bodies back into state ownership and/or control. The ideology behind the policies is purely decorative.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. UK news in pictures Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

Even Labour\u2019s most entrenched enemies admit the charm of the old form of words, crafted by Sidney and Beatrice Webb, pioneering Fabian socialists, shortly after the Russian revolution: \u201cTo secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.\u201d Like the \u201cRed Flag\u201d, true believers could recite the words.\n\nThe aim of socialist society built on \u201ccommon ownership\u201d, albeit a distant, almost millenarian one, dates back to before the first Labour government had even been formed, and came nowhere near enactment until the Attlee government embarked on a substantial programme of public ownership after 1945 (railways, coal, road freight, the Bank of England, electricity and gas supply, and even an attempt on the sugar industry). More followed in the 1960s (steel, buses) and the 1970s (British Leyland, shipbuilding, aerospace, parts of North Sea oil).\n\nYet it was not too long before nationalisation of industries (as opposed to the National Health Service, say) became an often loss-making laughing stock, a byword for inefficiency and union power, delivering intermittently poor services at inflated cost \u2013 as compared with the emerging power of private enterprise and its ability to deliver the new marvels of the consumer age to a public eager to expand its horizons and raise its living standards. \u201cNationalisation\u201d, \u201ccommon ownership\u201d, \u201cpublic ownership\u201d, whatever became an embarrassment, synonymous with failure and national decline, a stick with which to beat Labour, and reference to Clause IV was always resorted to when Conservatives ran out of rational arguments.\n\nAn attempt after the disastrous 1959 election by a \u201crevisionist\u201d social democrat Labour leader, Hugh Gaitskell, to replace Clause IV completely failed. Indeed, \u201ctrying to take the Book of Genesis out of the Bible\u201d, as it was derided, was so counterproductive that the old Clause IV was then printed on every Labour membership card. As a matter of historic curiosity, Gaitskell\u2019s wording was not as radical as what was to come in the 1990s, and in fact provided for further nationalisation of the \u201ccommanding heights\u201d of the economy. Corner shops and farms were safe, however: \u201cFurther extension of common ownership should be decided ... with due regard for the views of the workers and consumers concerned.\u201d It was rejected, and the party decided to \u201creaffirm, amplify and clarify\u201d Clause IV with the unexceptionable declaration that the Labour Party\u2019s \u201ccentral ideal is the brotherhood of man. Its purpose is to make this ideal a reality everywhere.\u201d (That latter phrase was a reference to decolonisation, though entirely unnecessary.)\n\nTony Blair made a much more determined assault on the old Clause IV, and his, unlike Gaitskell\u2019s, was better planned. Blair also had the great advantage that, by 1995, privatisation rather than nationalisation was the accepted norm, and almost everything in the public sector had been sold off. Only the royal mail and the BBC were left in the cupboard.\n\nLabour had by then entirely accepted the power of the dynamic market economy to create wealth, and of private enterprise to provide the finds to support employment, living standards and thriving public services. Blair\u2019s new Clause IV was very much of its time, and quite verbose. Clause IV now reads (in part): \u201cThe Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that by the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve alone so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few, where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe, and where we live together, freely, in a spirit of solidarity, tolerance and respect.\n\n\u201cTo these ends we work for: a dynamic economy, serving the public interest, in which the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition are joined with the forces of partnership and cooperation to produce the wealth the nation needs and the opportunity for all to work and prosper, with a thriving public sector and high-quality services, where those undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the public or accountable to them.\u201d\n\nUtterly unmemorable, which was perhaps just the point. It was Blair\u2019s \u201cClause IV moment\u201d, more symbolic than operational, an outward signal that Labour had changed, and become New Labour, its ideological baggage dumped. The creation of wealth was now more important than its subsequent distribution. Now, whatever Clause IV might eventually say, the party is being upended again, and the baggage of public ownership loaded back on board.", "description": "When Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party in 2015, many of its members, old and new, felt as though they had \u201cgot their party back\u201d \u2013 not least the ancient belief in public ownership, once enshrined in Clause IV of the party\u2019s constitution, the party\u2019s original \u201cmission statement\u201d, as it might be termed nowadays.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/17/corbyn-tuc-brighton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
