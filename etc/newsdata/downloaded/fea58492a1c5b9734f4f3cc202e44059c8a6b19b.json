(AP) \u2014 A man opened fire Thursday in the lobby of a building for senior residents, killing a man and wounding two women and then barricading himself inside his apartment before surrendering, police said.\n\nThe injuries of the wounded people were critical and they were taken to a hospital, fire department officials said.\n\nThe shooter was identified by police Thursday evening as 80-year-old Robert E. Breck, a resident of the 15-story Smith Tower building. Vancouver Police spokeswoman Kim Kapp said he surrendered.\n\nBreck was booked into Clark County Jail on suspicion of murder and attempted murder charges. It wasn\u2019t known if he has a lawyer.\n\nSome parts of the building had been evacuated during the standoff and other residents were told to stay inside their apartments. All were allowed back into their residences Thursday evening, police said.\n\nKapp said police did not know what led to the shooting or the identities of the people who were shot.\n\nKapp said the patrol officers who responded were replaced with SWAT team officers who have more tactical training because of the complexity of the situation. During the negotiations with the suspect, SWAT officers could be seen standing on balconies on several floors.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where it\u2019s a retirement community, so we have elderly residents as well as an elevator situation,\u201d Kapp said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the suspect is when you have a multi-story building like that.\u201d\n\nAustin Studebaker said he was buying drinks at a convenience store across the street from the building when he saw \u201cthe most cop cars I\u2019ve ever seen in my life swarm in.\u201d\n\nStudebaker said officers were carrying rifles and many were wearing body armor. Then Studebaker saw authorities carry a bleeding person out on a stretcher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just weird, and I want to know what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said.\n\nVancouver Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle said in a statement that \u201cour hearts go out to the victims and their families as they deal with this tragedy.\u201d\n\nVancouver is a city of about 175,000 people just north of Portland, Oregon.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed to this report from Seattle.", "description": "A man opened fire Thursday in the lobby of a building for senior residents, killing a man and wounding two women and then barricading himself inside his apartment before surrendering, police said.
