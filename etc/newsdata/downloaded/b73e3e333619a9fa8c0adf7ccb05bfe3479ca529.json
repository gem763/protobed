Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nA top official within the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid has resigned, citing a broken student-loan system. \u201cWe run through the process of putting this debt burden on somebody \u2026 but it rides on their credit files \u2014 it rides on their back \u2014 for decades,\u201d A. Wayne Johnson told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. \u201cThe time has come for us to end and stop the insanity.\u201d Johnson, a Republican, is now considering a run to replace Johnny Isakson when the Georgia senator retires at the end of the year. If elected, he may make student-loan forgiveness a legislative priority.\n\nJohnson has outlined his own plan to relieve student-debt burdens, the Journal reports. He\u2019d forgive all federal student-loan debt up to $50,000. Borrowers who have already repaid their debts would receive tax credits worth up to $50,000. Johnson says that he would pay for the plan with a 1 percent tax on corporate income.\n\nFascinating. High ranking official in DeVos\u2019s Federal Student Aid office resigned today, announced he is seeking U.S. Senate seat, and running as a Republican on a platform of eradicating student loan debt with a tax increase. pic.twitter.com/fsFQVbKmTS \u2014 Erica L. Green (@EricaLG) October 24, 2019\n\nDonald Trump had appointed Johnson to become the office\u2019s chief operating officer in 2017; he later changed roles, according to the Journal, and became the office\u2019s chief strategy and transformation officer. Until Thursday, it was Johnson\u2019s responsibility to modernize financial-aid delivery; a speaker biography provided for him by the International Institute for Business Information & Growth said he was leading \u201cthe conversion to a mobile first, mobile complete, omni-channel environment providing optimum customer service to students, parents and borrowers.\u201d Whatever this actually means, Johnson apparently decided it wasn\u2019t possible \u2014 that the student-loan system could not be modernized, indeed could not be made to work at all.\n\nAs an alternative, he\u2019s proposed a one-time $50,000 tuition voucher that functions like a grant. It\u2019s not clear if Johnson wants to offer that voucher in addition to Pell Grants, which do not have to be repaid, or if it would replace them. A $50,000 voucher doesn\u2019t actually get students much, even at public colleges and universities, so it\u2019s unlikely that Johnson\u2019s plan would totally eliminate the need for some student loans without additional and serious tuition reform. Senator Bernie Sanders has proposed tuition-free public college, for example, and so has Senator Elizabeth Warren; on the subject of debt cancellation, though, Sanders has the more generous plan. Unlike either Warren or Johnson, he\u2019d cancel all existing federal student-loan debt.\n\nThough Johnson\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t go as far as Sanders\u2019s plan, the former Trump official is now significantly at odds with the rest of his party, not to mention the White House itself. Under Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Department of Education has rejected 99 percent of all applicants to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Earlier this October, NPR reported that DeVos\u2019s department had blocked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from receiving information it needed to complete an investigation into the program\u2019s high rejection rate. DeVos has also made it more difficult for students to receive student-loan forgiveness if they\u2019ve been defrauded by their universities. \u201cUnder the previous rules, all one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money,\u201d she complained in 2017. The nation\u2019s total student-loan debt hit $1.6 trillion earlier this year.", "description": "A.
