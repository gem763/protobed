Two of the trains eventually went to Tunney's Pasture, and the third was taken to the east end, according to an email attributed to Troy Charter, the city's director of transit operations.\n\nThe LRT is set to be open to the public at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 14.\n\nThe Confederation Line is set to open to the public in just 10 days. (Joanne Chianello/CBC)\n\nRadios needed 'reset'\n\nAccording to Charter's email, \"three radio units that are part of the control system needed to be reset.\"\n\nAlthough there are human operators on the trains, the Confederation Line is run by an automatic computer system. The control system lost connection with three radios that communicate the locations of the trains.\n\nWhen the control system loses connection with the radios, it automatically shuts down the system as a safety measure.\n\nAccording to Charter's email, \"the cause of the radio shutdown is under investigation with one possible cause being last night's thunderstorm.\"\n\nThe shutdown raises a number of questions, especially because the system was supposed to be substantially completed in July, which meant that all testing was completed.\n\nThe city agreed last month that the trial run had been a success, and took over the system from Rideau Transit Group on Aug. 30.", "description": "Just five days after the city took control of the $2.1-billion LRT system\u00a0\u2014 and a little more than a week before it's supposed to\u00a0be open to the public\u00a0\u2014 more than half of the Confederation Line was shut down for hours on Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5064223.1553097449!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lrt1-in-station-ottawa-via-powerpoint-march-2019.jpg"}
