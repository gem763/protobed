Canadian authorities said in September a youth had been hospitalized, but so far no other countries have reported anything similar.\n\nPublic and political opinion appears to be hardening, however, with the administration of US President Donald Trump announcing in September it would ban in the coming months flavored e-cigarette products which are particularly attractive to young people.\n\nIndia has issued an outright ban on all e-cigarette products, as has the US state of Massachusetts.", "description": "The number of patients suffering from probable lung injury associated with e-cigarette use has surged to more than a thousand, US health authorities said Thursday, while the death toll from the outbreak now stands at 18.
