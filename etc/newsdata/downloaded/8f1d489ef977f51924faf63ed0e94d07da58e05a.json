New Zealand\u2019s old firm of Richie McCaw and Jerome Kaino were a prime example, steering the All Blacks to glory at the past two Rugby World Cups. South Africa had the teak-tough Schalk Burger and Juan Smith in 2007, while England in 2003 benefitted from the high-class duo of Richard Hill and Neil Back.\n\nAside from talent, the common denominator this century has been a lot of miles on the clock. McCaw, Hill and Back did not win a World Cup until they were over 30 and, of the rest, Burger was alone in doing so before the age of 25. It is necessary to rewind right back to the amateur era and the legendary All Black Michael Jones in 1987 to find a flanker who conquered the world before his 23rd birthday.\n\nBilly Vunipola tells South Africa to \u2018bring it on\u2019 in Rugby World Cup final Read more\n\nWhich brings us to England\u2019s Tom Curry, now just 80 minutes away from breaking Jones\u2019s long-standing record. Curry only turned 21 in June yet, alongside his 23-year-old teammate Sam Underhill, he has been among the most influential players at this World Cup. If England\u2019s increasingly impressive defence proves the difference against South Africa this weekend, the newly-minted word \u2018Undercurry\u2019 (strong, unyielding, seriously tasty) may soon be pushing for inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nEven if their team falls short, Curry and Underhill will return home having had the ultimate seal of approval from their defence coach John Mitchell. The ex-All Black coach has worked with many of the best back-rowers in the modern game and is seldom prone to exaggeration but in this instance he has already made his mind up. Not only do England\u2019s youthful duo remind him of McCaw and the esteemed Wallaby David Pocock but, he says, they are already more dynamic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of McCaw and a lot of Pocock in them but they\u2019re quicker,\u201d suggested Mitchell, after England had finished training in the Tokyo rain. \u201cHaving played in the back-row and coached a lot of fine back-rowers in the world you get a bit of a feel for who is outstanding and who isn\u2019t. These two have still got so much more growth in them ... they have the ability to be world class.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England defence coach John Mitchell says that Sam Underhill and Tom Curry \u201chave got rocks and boulders in their shoulders\u201d.

Stopping a herd of charging wildebeest would be only marginally easier than tackling some of their opponents\u2019 monster forwards in full cry but, as Curry and Underhill demonstrated last Saturday, the bigger they are the harder they fall. Their chop tackling and insatiable work-rate effectively left the All Blacks with nowhere to go.\n\nIf it helps slightly that, to use Mitchell\u2019s phrase, the pair \u201chave got rocks and boulders in their shoulders\u201d their commitment has been staggering. England\u2019s bruise brothers have also made a deliberate point of tackling lower, among the tactics which made life so awkward for New Zealand. \u201cYes, we do work on that,\u201d confirmed Mitchell. \u201cWe address it as part of the way we practise but the players own it. Every team has different strengths so the carrier types coming towards you every weekend are slightly different. That requires some adjustments but they are bright lads. They\u2019re smart as well.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nWith the entire team queuing up to make dominant tackles on behalf of their mates alongside them, Mitchell continues to take the view that defence is, ultimately, what wins World Cups. \u201cYeah, I think defence has been a common thread that\u2019s come out of World Cups over the years and it\u2019s going to be really important again on the weekend. It\u2019s important for us to continue to get better in that particular area and be even more patient in the way we execute.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Curry\u2019s insatiable work-rate helped England build a platform on which to beat New Zealand in the semi-final.

It is what Springboks rugby has always been built on - that ability to create pressure. But what\u2019s great is there is now another team who can create that type of pressure - and that is us.\u201d\n\nCurry, Underhill, Lawes, Vunipola, Vunipola, Itoje, Sinckler, George ... find an easy route through that formidable posse and South Africa will fully deserve to lift the Webb Ellis Cup. Resolute defence, as Wales discovered on Sunday, is not enough on its own to win major Test matches but it can make a decisive difference. \u201cWe are about to witness the two most powerful rugby teams in the world,\u201d confirmed Mitchell. \u201cThe gain line is going to be huge.\u201d\n\nOn the evidence of recent weeks, even the massive Springbok forwards should brace themselves.", "description": "England\u2019s defence coach John Mitchell believes back-rowers can win World Cups \u2011 and in Sam Underhill and Tom Curry he has two of the best around", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b63e146a215f97a66f27d69705615555686d44fb/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94f39a1ba44852cc9fe3aedcdf023245", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
