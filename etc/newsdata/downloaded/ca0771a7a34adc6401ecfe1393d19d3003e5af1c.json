In FY 2019, U.S. global health funding totaled $11 billion. Most U.S. funding for global health is provided bilaterally (approximately 80%). Of the multilateral share, the majority is provided to The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund). The U.S. investment in global health grew significantly between 2001 to 2010, largely due to the creation of new initiatives including the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (PMI). However, since FY 2010, U.S. funding for global health has remained relatively flat. The FY 2020 President\u2019s budget request proposes to reduce global health funding to $8 billion, its lowest level since FY 2008.\n\nU.S. Global Health Funding: Figures\n\nU.S. Global Health Funding: Table\n\nTable 1: Historical Funding by Agency for Global Health; in millions Agency 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Request HIV/AIDS $5,487.6 $5,573.6 $5,439.6 $5,124.8 $4,709.3 $4,940.2 $5,220.5 $5,217.7 $5,320.0 $5,351.3 $5,426.7 $3,930.9 State $4,559.0 $4,609.0 $4,585.8 $4,242.9 $3,870.8 $4,020.0 $4,320.0 $4,320.0 $4,320.0 $4,320.0 $4,370.0 $3,350.0 USAID $350.0 $350.0 $349.3 $350.3 $333.2 $330.2 $330.2 $330.2 $330.2 $330.2 $330.2 $0.2 HHS $570.6 $604.6 $494.5 $523.6 $497.3 $582.0 $562.3 $559.5 $661.8 $693.1 $718.5 $580.7 Other Agencies HIV/AIDS $8.0 $10.0 $10.0 $8.0 $8.0 $8.0 $8.0 $8.0 $8.0 $8.0 $8.0 $0.0 TB $176.6 $249.0 $238.4 $256.3 $232.5 $242.5 $242.3 $240.0 $243.6 $265.0 $306.0 $262.0 USAID $176.6 $249.0 $238.4 $256.3 $232.5 $242.5 $242.3 $240.0 $243.6 $265.0 $306.0 $262.0 Malaria $534.5 $754.5 $800.5 $811.6 $821.7 $862.1 $854.3 $873.1 $963.0 $973.9 $984.1 $870.7 USAID $385.0 $585.0 $618.8 $650.0 $656.4 $665.0 $669.5 $674.0 $755.0 $755.0 $755.0 $674.0 HHS $119.0 $143.2 $154.3 $161.6 $156.6 $180.0 $173.9 $193.7 $202.7 $212.7 $222.7 $192.7 DoD $30.6 $26.4 $27.4 $0.0 $8.7 $17.2 $10.9 $5.3 $5.3 $6.3 $6.5 $4.0 Global Fund $1,000.0 $1,050.0 $1,045.8 $1,300.0 $1,569.0 $1,650.0 $1,350.0 $1,350.0 $1,350.0 $1,350.0 $1,350.0 $958.4 State $600.0 $750.0 $748.5 $1,300.0 $1,569.0 $1,650.0 $1,350.0 $1,350.0 $1,350.0 $1,350.0 $1,350.0 $958.4 USAID $100.0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 NIH $300.0 $300.0 $297.3 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Maternal & Child Health (MCH) $871.9 $938.8 $974.4 $1,059.5 $1,036.8 $1,147.3 $1,176.4 $1,136.4 $1,235.1 $1,208.5 $1,214.0 $901.1 USAID $596.1 $649.9 $691.3 $760.0 $752.2 $815.0 $835.8 $784.9 $873.6 $845.0 $850.5 $695.1 State $132.5 $135.3 $132.3 $131.8 $125.2 $132.0 $132.0 $132.5 $137.5 $137.5 $137.5 $0.0 CDC $143.3 $153.7 $150.9 $167.7 $159.5 $200.4 $208.6 $219.0 $224.0 $226.0 $226.0 $206.0 Nutrition $54.9 $107.3 $92.8 $97.0 $97.4 $139.5 $138.6 $143.8 $148.0 $125.0 $145.0 $89.7 USAID $54.9 $107.3 $92.8 $97.0 $97.4 $139.5 $138.6 $143.8 $148.0 $125.0 $145.0 $89.7 Vulnerable Children $15.0 $15.0 $15.0 $17.5 $16.6 $22.0 $22.0 $22.0 $23.0 $23.0 $24.0 $0.0 USAID $15.0 $15.0 $15.0 $17.5 $16.6 $22.0 $22.0 $22.0 $23.0 $23.0 $24.0 $0.0 Family Planning & Reproductive Health $552.4 $715.1 $632.6 $638.5 $615.1 $622.3 $621.9 $603.9 $607.5 $607.5 $607.5 $259.0 USAID $522.4 $663.7 $595.6 $608.3 $586.2 $591.6 $591.1 $573.2 $607.5 $607.5 $575.0 $259.0 State $30.0 $51.4 $37.0 $30.2 $28.9 $30.7 $30.8 $30.7 $0.0 $0.0 $32.5 $0.0 Global Health Security $417.0 $486.5 $397.0 $390.3 $366.2 $498.5 $1,341.6 $552.1 $364.1 $512.3 $503.5 $482.1 USAID $140.0 $201.5 $47.9 $58.1 $55.2 $72.6 $384.5 $218.0 $72.5 $172.6 $138.0 $90.0 CDC $47.5 $61.9 $51.2 $55.6 $54.3 $62.6 $652.1 $55.2 $58.2 $108.2 $108.2 $149.8 DoD $229.5 $223.1 $297.9 $276.6 $256.6 $363.4 $305.0 $278.9 $233.4 $231.5 $257.3 $242.3 Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) $25.0 $65.0 $76.8 $89.0 $85.6 $100.0 $100.0 $100.0 $100.0 $100.0 $102.5 $75.0 USAID $25.0 $65.0 $76.8 $89.0 $85.6 $100.0 $100.0 $100.0 $100.0 $100.0 $102.5 $75.0 Other $299.1 $300.6 $306.2 $284.2 $277.2 $290.5 $287.6 $293.1 $352.4 $319.2 $288.6 $176.1 USAID $64.8 $53.7 $56.9 $29.4 $22.2 $33.7 $26.5 $31.6 $90.7 $50.0 $17.0 $4.6 State $165.7 $166.4 $169.9 $172.5 $175.6 $175.6 $179.6 $177.3 $175.7 $178.2 $178.2 $90.8 CDC \u2014 $10.5 $10.1 $12.8 $13.9 $13.7 $13.7 $13.8 $13.8 $15.3 $15.3 $13.8 NIH $68.6 $70.0 $69.3 $69.5 $65.5 $67.5 $67.8 $70.4 $72.2 $75.7 $78.1 $67.0 Total $9,434.0 $10,255.3 $10,019.0 $10,068.6 $9,827.6 $10,515.0 $11,355.2 $10,532.1 $10,706.7 $10,835.7 $10,952.0 $8,005.0 NOTES: Totals include base and supplemental funding. FY13 includes the effects of sequestration. FY18 is a preliminary estimate. FY19 is based on funding provided in the \u201cConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2019\u201d (P.L. 116-6) and is a preliminary estimate (some FY19 global health funding provided through CDC as well as the Economic Support Fund (ESF) and Development Assistance (DA) accounts at USAID is not yet known; for comparison purposes, these amounts are estimated using prior year levels). In the FY20 Request, the administration is proposing to create a new \u201cGlobal Tuberculosis\u201d funding line under global health programs at CDC and transfer funding historically provided through the \u201cHIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STI and TB Prevention\u201d funding line to global TB. Global malaria funding at CDC is provided through the \u201cParasitic Diseases and Malaria\u201d funding line, but an exact funding amount for malaria is not specified; in recent fiscal years, malaria funding at CDC has remained level at $10.7 million. MCH includes contributions to UNICEF (funding for UNICEF was not specified in the FY20 Request). MCH and Nutrition do not include funding provided through Food for Peace (FFP) due to the unique nature of the program. FP/RH includes contributions to UNFPA. In FY17 and FY18, the administration invoked the Kemp-Kasten amendment to prohibit contributions to UNFPA (see \u201cUNFPA Funding & Kemp-Kasten: An Explainer\u201d) and transferred the funding to the GHP account for bilateral FP/RH activities. The administration also invoked the Kemp-Kasten amendment in FY19 to prohibit contributions to UNFPA; it is assumed these funds will be transferred to bilateral FP/RH programs under the GHP account at USAID as was done in FY17 and FY18. Global Health Security includes emergency Ebola and Zika funding (in FY15, Congress provided $5.4 billion in emergency funding to address the Ebola outbreak, of which $909.0 million was specifically designated for global health security, and in FY16, Congress provided $1.1 billion in emergency funding to address the Zika outbreak, of which $145.5 million was specifically designated for global health security). \u201cOther\u201d includes funding for WHO and PAHO; global parasitic diseases at CDC; the Fogarty International Center at NIH; as well as the Emergency Reserve Fund, which was created in the FY17 Omnibus bill to respond to contagious infectious disease outbreaks, and would be made available if there is an \u201cemerging health threat that poses severe threats to human health.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of data from the Office of Management and Budget, Agency Congressional Budget Justifications, Congressional Appropriations Bills, and U.S. Foreign Assistance Dashboard [website], available at: http://www.foreignassistance.gov.\n\nBack to top\n\nU.S. Global Health Budget: HIV/PEPFAR\n\nDOWNLOAD HIV/PEPFAR AS A 1-PAGER (.pdf)\n\nThe U.S. first provided funding to address the global HIV epidemic in 1986. U.S. efforts and funding increased slowly over time until the launch of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, which initiated a period of significant increases and is the largest effort devoted to a single disease in the world. All U.S. funding for global HIV falls under PEPFAR. The majority of this funding is provided through the Department of State, which is responsible, through the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), for coordinating all U.S. programs, activities, and funding for global HIV efforts. Other agencies that receive HIV funding include the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Department of Defense (DoD). (Additional U.S. support for HIV activities is provided through its contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria). Funding rose significantly in PEPFAR\u2019s first decade, reaching its peak in FY 2010; in recent years, funding has been relatively flat. Bilateral HIV funding has historically accounted for the largest share of the U.S. global health budget (ranging from 46% to 58% since 2009). In FY 2019, U.S. bilateral funding for HIV totaled $5.4 billion and accounted for 50% of the U.S. global health budget. The President\u2019s FY 2020 request proposes to cut U.S. funding for HIV by $1.5 billion; if approved by Congress, this would be the lowest level of funding provided to HIV since 2008.

The Global Fund receives contributions from public and private donors and in turn provides funding to countries based on country-defined proposals. The U.S. provided the Global Fund with its founding contribution in 2001 and has since been its largest single donor. U.S. contributions to the Global Fund rose significantly in the last decade, and reached a peak of $1.65 billion in FY 2014; after declining to $1.35 billion in FY 2015, U.S. funding for the Global Fund has since remained flat. Congress places a number of restrictions on U.S. contributions to the Global Fund, including total U.S. contributions must not exceed 33% of total contributions from all donors. In FY 2019, the Global Fund accounted for the second largest share of U.S. funding for global health (12%). The President\u2019s FY 2020 request includes $958 million for the Global Fund in FY 2020, a cut of $392 million (-29%) below the FY 2019 level.

MCH funding, which includes funding for polio and U.S. contributions to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (GAVI) and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), is provided through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the State Department. U.S. funding for MCH increased from $728 million in FY 2006 to $1.2 billion in FY 2019. This was primarily driven by increased funding to GAVI and polio during the period. In fact, when these are removed, bilateral MCH funding has remained relatively level for several years over the period. In FY 2019, MCH accounted for the third largest share of U.S. funding for global health (11%). The President\u2019s FY 2020 request proposes $901 million for MCH, a cut of $313 million (-26%) below the FY 2019 level, which would bring funding down to FY 2010 levels.

The majority of U.S. FP/RH funding is provided through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for bilateral activities, with additional funding provided through the State Department for the U.S. contribution to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Funding for FP/RH rose steadily over its first two decades of U.S. support, but has since fluctuated over time, including declines in some periods. After funding declined in the prior decade, and then flattened, it rose steeply in 2009, hitting its peak in 2010 ($715 million). U.S. funding for FP/RH declined the following year and has since remained relatively flat at just about $600 million, accounting for approximately 5-7% of the U.S. global health budget each year. In FY 2017 and FY 2018, the Administration invoked the Kemp-Kasten amendment, prohibiting U.S. contributions to UNFPA, and is expected to do the same in FY 2019.
