One threw a petrol bomb at police in the Wan Chai metro station. Others tried and failed to smash cameras over Bank of China ATMs but spray-painted the screens instead.\n\nAt least one petrol bomb landed in the grounds of central government offices where several windows were smashed. There were also street fires on the main drag of Hennessy Road.\n\n\u2018WE HAVE TOLERATED ENOUGH\u2019\n\nProtesters also smashed the windows of a taxi and sprayed graffiti on the windows of businesses including Starbucks outlets. Small scuffles continued into the evening.\n\nPolice, who raise placards warning of retaliation before firing tear gas or firing water cannon in a tradition dating back to British rule, made several arrests, often after grappling people to the tarmac.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of serious injuries.\n\nThe water cannon fired blue dye, which elsewhere in the world is used to make identification of offenders easier.\n\nHo, a 25-year-old working at an investment bank, was scattering bricks along a road in Wan Chai for others to use.\n\n\u201cWhen the police come, we have to move quickly and we need to pick these up as we run,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked how he knew when the police were coming, he said supporters were following police all day, trying to listen in on their plans.\n\nThe government said that the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, will be out of town for China\u2019s National Day despite her having sent invitations for celebrations at home.\n\nAnti-government protesters lie down as they demonstrate in Hong Kong, China September 29, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nSome shops closed ahead of expected demonstrations, while the MTR metro service shut stations in a move that has made it a target of violence in the past. Protesters hurled petrol bombs into a station and set fires, MTR said in a statement.\n\nOne group entered the rear driving cabin of a train and opened the emergency exit ramp to place a fire extinguisher on the track, causing a temporary suspension of services, it said.\n\nProtesters shouted anti-China slogans and called for the government to meet their \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d, including universal suffrage and the dropping of all charges against their arrested colleagues.\n\nElsewhere in the city, around midday, about 200 China supporters dressed in red T-shirts gathered on top of Victoria Peak, overlooking the harbour. They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted \u201cI love China\u201d.\n\nAngela, a housewife in her forties with a Chinese flag sticker on her cheek, described the pro-democracy protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the government takes violent action, I don\u2019t object,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tolerated enough. I think I have emotional problems because of the riots. Because it\u2019s not safe to go out.\u201d\n\nCHANGE OF HEART\n\nLam, the focus of weeks of anti-government unrest, will leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic the following day.\n\nTrapped in an indoor stadium by street protests for hours this week after an \u201copen dialogue\u201d with the people, Lam will return overland to Hong Kong on Tuesday night, minimising the chances of a clash at the airport, a popular target for protestors.\n\nShe had sent out invitations \u201crequesting the pleasure of your company\u201d at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart, but the government said that the chief secretary for administration, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, would stand in.\n\nArthur, 40, wearing glasses and a mask covering the lower half of his face, said Lam\u2019s trip was expected.\n\n\u201cIn these three months, Carrie Lam has not really cared about the protesters. She only cares about the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or what we might call \u2018her boss\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think Hong Kong is somehow at this moment the front line between Western democracy and the dictatorship in China ... Hong Kong looks more and more like a police state.\u201d\n\nPolice fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nThe protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which Britain returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nChina dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.\n\nProtests were sparked in June by planned legislation that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. The bill was later withdrawn, but the protests have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas at petrol bomb-throwing protesters on Sunday in some of the most widespread and violent clashes in more than three months of anti-government unrest.", "authors": ["Alun John", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435157685&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S09J", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
