It\u2019s unclear whether the White House has the legal capability to expand these policies without Congress\u2019 approval.\n\nHe\u2019s also expected to push for changes that could lower the price of patient visits to hospital outpatient visits, which can cost more than visits to clinics operated by doctors.\n\nTrump hopes to draw a sharp contrast between his plan and the vast proposals introduced by Democratic presidential hopefuls, including calls to totally eliminate private insurance. However, there\u2019s a growing schism between moderate Democrats who want to keep private insurance, and progressives who want to roll it under the arm of the government.\n\n\u201cI know [Sen. Warren] says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden said during the most recent Democratic debate. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack.
