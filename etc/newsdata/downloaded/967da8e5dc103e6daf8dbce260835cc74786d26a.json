(Al Drago/The New York Times) More\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump knew the Central Intelligence Agency and Special Operations commandos were zeroing in on the location for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State leader, when he ordered U.S. troops to withdraw from northern Syria earlier this month, intelligence, military and counterterrorism officials said Sunday.\n\nFor months, intelligence officials had kept Trump apprised of what he had set as a top priority, the hunt for al-Baghdadi, the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal order three weeks ago disrupted the meticulous planning underway and forced Pentagon officials to speed up the plan for the risky night raid before their ability to control troops, spies and reconnaissance aircraft disappeared with the pullout, officials said.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s death in the raid Saturday, they said, occurred largely despite, and not because of, Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nIt is unclear how much Trump considered the intelligence on al-Baghdadi\u2019s location when he made the surprise decision to withdraw U.S. troops during a telephone call Oct. 6 with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. What is clear, military officials said, is that it put commanders on the ground under even more pressure to carry out the complicated operation.\n\nMore than a half-dozen Pentagon, military, intelligence and counterterrorism officials \u2014 along with Trump, who gave an account during a White House news conference Sunday \u2014 provided a chronology of the raid.\n\nThe planning for the raid began this past summer, when the CIA first got surprising information about al-Baghdadi\u2019s general location in a village deep inside a part of northwestern Syria controlled by rival al-Qaida groups. The information came after the arrest and interrogation of one of al-Baghdadi\u2019s wives and a courier, two U.S. officials said.\n\nArmed with that initial tip, the CIA worked closely with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials in Iraq and Syria to identify more precisely al-Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts and to put spies in place to monitor his periodic movements. U.S. officials said the Kurds continued to provide information to the CIA on al-Baghdadi\u2019s location even after Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops left the Syrian Kurds to confront a Turkish offensive alone.\n\nThe Syrian and Iraqi Kurds, one official said, provided more intelligence for the raid than any single country.\n\nAccording to a Syrian engineer who spoke with villagers living near the raid site, al-Baghdadi had sought shelter in the home of Abu Mohammed Salama, a commander of another extremist group, Hurras al-Din. The commander\u2019s fate in that raid and the precise nature of his relationship to al-Baghdadi are not clear.\n\nAs the Army\u2019s elite Delta Force commando unit began drawing up and rehearsing plans to conduct the mission to kill or capture the ISIS leader, they knew they faced formidable hurdles. The location was deep inside territory controlled by al-Qaida. The skies over that part of the country were controlled by Syria and Russia.\n\nThe military called off missions at least twice at the last minute.\n\nThe final planning for the raid came together over two to three days last week. A senior administration official said that al-Baghdadi was \u201cabout to move.\u201d Military officials determined that they had to go swiftly. If al-Baghdadi moved again, it would be much harder to track him with the U.S. military pulling out its troops and surveillance assets on the ground in Syria.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump knew the Central Intelligence Agency and Special Operations commandos were zeroing in on the location for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State leader, when he ordered U.S. troops to withdraw from northern Syria earlier this month, intelligence, military and counterterrorism", "authors": ["Eric Schmitt", "Helene Cooper", "Julian E.
