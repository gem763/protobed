After a group photo with the hostages a woman called Pat told the leader Alan\u2019s age.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nAlan vividly recalls her words : \u201cPat said to him, \u2018Mr President, this boy is only 15-years-old and his parents don\u2019t know if he is alive. Is there anything you can do for him?\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe paused and turned and said something to the interpreter.\n\n\"The interpreter looked stunned and said, \u2018The President of Iraq has just asked if you would like to go home?\u2019.\n\n\"At that point I burst into tears. It was an overwhelming sense of joy and bewilderment.\u201d\n\nAlan was given $500 and put on a plane to Jordan, where British Airways reps escorted him back to London to reunite him with his family.\n\n(Image: Bath Chronicle / SWNS)\n\nAlan, now a 44-year-old accountant living in Bath, said: \u201cClearly Saddam Hussein was an evil man, but he was also a product of his upbringing.\n\n\u201cHis stepfather would beat him with iron rods and he was in gangs. That\u2019s not to excuse what he did.\u201d\n\nThe married dad of two said: \u201cI had never felt any animosity towards him. I was grateful I was released but I never felt in danger.\u201d\n\nBritons among the plane\u2019s 367 passengers and crew were held by Saddam\u2019s regime for five months.", "description": "Alan Barnett was on his way back to boarding school in India - but when his plane landed in Kuwait - he was held under guard at the airport for 10 days", "authors": ["Louie Smith", "Image", "Bath Chronicle", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20525735.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Alan-Barnett.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
