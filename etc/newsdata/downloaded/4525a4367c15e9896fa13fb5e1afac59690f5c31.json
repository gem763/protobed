It also has led Dallas Police Chief U. Rene\u00e9 Hall to announce the internal affairs department would look into the deleted texts and deactivated camera. The Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment Wednesday on whether it is also investigating.\n\nDallas Police Association President Mike Mata said Wednesday that he was guarding Guyger\u2019s rights when he had another officer shut off the camera in a police car where Guyger waited after the shooting.\n\nGuyger and her partner, Martin Rivera, both acknowledged from the witness stand that they deleted text messages following Jean\u2019s death about their on-and-off relationship. Prosecutors managed to recover the texts and argued that the white officer was distracted by the explicit messages she exchanged with Rivera soon before she walked into her black neighbor\u2019s apartment, which she said she thought was her own. Guyger testified that she mistook the 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia for an intruder before shooting him.\n\nRaising the 31-year-old officer\u2019s sexual text messages with her partner, Mata said, was prosecutors\u2019 \u201cattempt to slut shame her.\u201d\n\nSome Dallas residents\u2019 deep mistrust of their police has been on display since Guyger\u2019s trial ended.\n\nThe first meeting of a new Community Police Oversight Committee ended with shoving and shouting Tuesday night when the panel adjourned without taking public comment. Hall intervened and opened the floor to discussion, much of it critical of the department and mistrustful of the committee\u2019s intensions.\n\nAnd conspiracy theories have swirled around the death of a witness in Guyger\u2019s trial, who was shot dead two days after her sentencing. Investigators said Tuesday that the killing of Joshua Brown, who like Jean was black, was unrelated to his testimony and that they suspect three Louisiana men , who were allegedly in Dallas to buy drugs.\n\nLee Merritt, a lawyer who represents the Jean and Brown families, said he has no reason to doubt Dallas detectives\u2019 conclusions. But he\u2019s asking the department to turn the investigation of Brown\u2019s death over to another agency.\n\n\u201cIt will be nearly impossible to conduct a reliable investigation in a climate where the investigating agency has been implicated in the murder itself,\u201d Merritt said Tuesday. \u201cThat implication naturally stems from a trial where a Dallas police officer was convicted of murder and other DPD officers were shown to have participated in condemnable behavior in destroying evidence and interfering with an investigation.\u201d\n\nMata said the text messages were not related to the shooting and prosecutors only brought them up at Guyger\u2019s trial to put \u201cthe scarlet letter on her as a person involved in adultery.\u201d Rivera was married; Guyger was not.\n\nAs for the car camera, Mata said he did nothing wrong by having it turned off.\n\n\u201cShe was talking with her attorney, and that\u2019s attorney-client privilege,\u201d Mata said. \u201c(The lead prosecutor) pushed this narrative to make it look like the department was corrupt and I was corrupt and unethical. It\u2019s a win-at-all-costs type of mentality.\u201d\n\nDr. Brian Williams, the former head of the Dallas\u2019 police oversight board, said the actions revealed at trial further eroded trust for police that already is thin in the community.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re working to try to build trust things like that do not work to the advantage of bringing both parties together,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, the Jean family stood with Dallas activists and religious leaders asking the U.S. Department of Justice to conduct a \u201ccomprehensive audit\u201d of what they characterized as long-standing problems with the city police department.\n\nThe Justice Department under former President Barack Obama opened wide-ranging investigations into more than 20 local law enforcement agencies it said had a pattern of civil rights violations, including departments in Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri. These probes typically ended with court-enforceable consent decrees that commit the department to making changes recommended by the federal government.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the department has taken a sharply different approach, pulling back from such sprawling investigations. But its civil rights division has continued to pursue investigations involving police shootings and other alleged misconduct.\n\nWhen looking at a police shooting, investigators will start with a different set of assumptions than they would in a shooting involving only civilians, said Bowling Green State University criminologist Philip Stinson, a former lawyer and police officer. He said one of the most important steps a department can take to foster community trust in such cases is to bring in an outside agency to investigate.\n\nIn Guyger\u2019s case, it was the Texas Rangers who led the investigation. Stinson said it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the former officer was convicted and sentenced to prison.\n\n\u201cI think that the community is right to push for transparency and for the Dallas police department to improve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that justice has been served.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker and Michael Balsamo in Washington and Jamie Stengle in Dallas contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Bleiberg on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jzbleiberg", "description": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Evidence from the trial of a former Dallas police officer convicted of killing her neighbor has fueled new questions about whether accused", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/47cc9d_aptopix-dallas-officer-mistaken-apartment-66108-holding-bible-her-by-state-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
