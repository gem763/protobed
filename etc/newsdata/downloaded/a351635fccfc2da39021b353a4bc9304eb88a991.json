We made it, what can you do.\u201d\n\nThe Russian, Chinese and Japanese men had already booked their Tokyo spots by finishing on the podium at last year\u2019s worlds in Doha.\n\nRussia (259.928) topped qualifying after Sunday\u2019s barnstorming qualifying run which saw reigning European champion Nikita Nagornyy set the all around pace with a total of 87.333 across six disciplines.\n\nDefending champion China took second spot on the back of 2017 all-around gold medallist Xiao Ruoteng\u2019s 85.831, while Japan finished third despite missing 21-time world medallist Kohei Uchimura through injury.\n\nKazuma Kaya\u2019s 14.800 on parallel bars and 14.633 on pommel horse proved Japan have arrived with enough firepower to challenge for a podium finish in the team finals.\n\nWhitlock did not have enough time to prepare for the floor at the worlds but he powered through the pommel horse routine to lead the field with a score of 15.266.\n\nOnly the top eight qualify for Wednesday\u2019s team final at the worlds so South Korea, Brazil, Spain and Germany missed out.\n\nQUALIFICATION \u2018DISASTER\u2019\n\nAmerican Sam Mikulak was lucky to secure the last qualifying slot for the all around final but the six-time U.S. national champion was far from pleased with his team\u2019s overall display.\n\nYul Moldauer and Mikulak both faltered on the pommel horse, leaving the team with plenty of ground to cover on the remaining four apparatus.\n\n\u201cToday was a disaster,\u201d the 26-year-old, who also fell during the floor exercise, told the Olympic Channel after the U.S. finished seventh in qualifying with a total of 250.359.\n\n\u201cI never woke up. That\u2019s the best way I can put it.\n\n\u201cHonestly, this is probably the worst we will ever be in a competition collectively.\u201d\n\nMikulak\u2019s own chances of qualifying for Friday\u2019s all-round final looked in jeopardy before team mate Akash Modi slipped off the horizontal bar, handing the twice world medallist a lifeline.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nHe approached the high bar needing to score more than 14.565 to finish among the top-two Americans and earned 14.866 on the apparatus where he grabbed bronze in Doha.\n\n\u201cI was just happy that I finally lived up to my expectations and my potential,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunate it took so long to do that, but I got one in there and I can hope that\u2019s the standard I can set moving forward.\u201d", "description": "With no medals up for grabs on Monday at the world gymnastics championships, the race was on for the men to secure team spots for next year's Tokyo Olympics and Ukraine led the way in joining heavyweights Russia, China and Japan.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438234206&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961QI", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
