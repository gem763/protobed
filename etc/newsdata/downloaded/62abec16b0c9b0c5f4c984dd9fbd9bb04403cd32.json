They have been \"left in limbo\" in the past 10 days, the NGO said.\n\nLibyan authorities say they assigned the port of Tripoli as a safe disembarkation site for the refugees, a statement subsequently refuted by SOS Mediterranee.\n\nItalian and Maltan authorities have not yet replied to requests by the group to allow the ship to dock.\n\nMigrants attempting to reach Europe in recent years have mainly been fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.\n\nDozens have also been killed trying to make the Mediterranean crossing.\n\nConfirmed deaths on the three main Mediterranean migratory routes in the first nine months of the year were 994, according to the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nThe number is the lowest recorded since 2014. It is not because of an improvement in safety conditions but rather a reduction in the number of people attempting to cross, the IOM said.\n\nInterior ministers from five European Union countries said last month they had agreed on a new plan to distribute migrants saved from the Mediterranean under a deal aimed at relieving the pressure on southern EU states.\n\nREAD MORE: EU countries stalemate over migration relocation plans\n\n\u201cThe situation currently faced by the Ocean Viking shows how fragile the announced EU disembarkation pilot project is.
