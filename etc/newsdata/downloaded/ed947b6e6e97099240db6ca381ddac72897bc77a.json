IOVA intends to commercialize \"autologous cell therapy products for solid tumors and blood cancers.\" Their approach uses a patient's own immune cells to attack cancer cells -- cutting edge stuff, if you ask me. Iovance Biotherapeutics ( IOVA ) is worth speculating on, as the company's cancer treatments are promising, Jim Cramerduring his Mad Money program Friday night. IOVA intends to commercialize \"autologous cell therapy products for solid tumors and blood cancers.\" Their approach uses a patient's own immune cells to attack cancer cells -- cutting edge stuff, if you ask me.\n\nLet's check out the charts and indicators of IOVA.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of IOVA, below, we can see that prices made a seven-plus month base around $10 before a gap to the upside got the rally going. Prices corrected/pulled back in August and appear to be getting ready to rally again as they approach the underside of the declining 50-day moving average line.\n\nThe daily trading volume has been heavier since the middle of May and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) led the way higher as it started to show more aggressive buying in early April -- weeks ahead of the upside breakout.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator crossed to the upside in late August for a cover shorts buy signal. A move above the zero line will be an outright buy signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of IOVA, below, we can see more of the price history of this company. We can can see an earlier base in the $6-$8 area from late 2016 to early 2018. There is a steep rally to $20 in early 2018 followed by a long correction back to $8 by early 2019. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is positive especially last year when prices corrected but the OBV line held rock solid telling us that strong hands stayed with the stock. Prices and the OBV line recently corrected and the MACD oscillator has signaled a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of IOVA, below, we can see an upside price target being projected in the $25 area.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Risking a close below $18.50 traders could go long IOVA at current levels. A rally to $25 and then perhaps new highs is possible with this company. It is all about the results.", "description": "Iovance Biotherapeutics: Technical Analysis and Strategy...IOVA", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Iovance Biotherapeutics", "Technical Analysis", "Let'S Check Out The Charts", "Indicators Of Iova.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/7947f1c3-6441-11e8-9389-e94e2427b4e6.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
