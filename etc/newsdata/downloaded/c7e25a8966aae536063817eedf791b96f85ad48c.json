People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country,\u201d he retorted. He told the reporter not to be \u201crude\u201d and repeatedly evaded the question.\n\nTrump suggested, however, that his objective was corruption in Ukraine, saying the United States gives the country a lot of money, and \u201cI don\u2019t like giving money to a country that\u2019s that corrupt. ... I don\u2019t like being the sucker country.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 subpoena request has the potential to become a flashpoint in the showdown between the Republican president and the Democratic-led House of Representatives.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a close ally of Trump, acknowledged earlier in the day during a trip to Italy that he had listened in on the call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, a former U.S. vice president and a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe call prompted the House to launch its impeachment inquiry last week. Pompeo\u2019s admission came a day after he objected to Democratic efforts as part of the impeachment inquiry to obtain depositions from five current and former State Department officials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fooling around here, though. We don\u2019t want this to drag on months and months and months, which appears to be the administration\u2019s strategy,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, whose panel leads the inquiry, told a news conference alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings said he intended to subpoena the White House for the Ukraine-related records on Friday, the latest demand for evidence from an administration that has repeatedly resisted such efforts by Democrats.\n\nTrump seemed to make light of the request, telling reporters that Pelosi \u201chands out subpoenas like they\u2019re cookies.\u201d\n\nSchiff said Democrats were deeply concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s potential interference with witnesses, and that any such efforts by the president, Pompeo or others would be considered obstruction of justice.\n\nThe House launched its impeachment inquiry, which threatens Trump\u2019s presidency, following a complaint brought by a whistleblower within the U.S. intelligence community over Trump\u2019s request to Zelenskiy.\n\nThe whistleblower provided an account of his concerns to a House Intelligence Committee aide before bringing his complaint, and some of that information was shared with Schiff, the New York Times reported, citing a spokesman for Schiff and current and former U.S. officials.\n\nTrump said the newspaper\u2019s report showed that \u201cSchiff is a fraud\u201d and the president called it a \u201cscandal\u201d that Schiff had advance knowledge of the complaint. \u201cHe probably helped write it,\u201d Trump said, without offering evidence.\n\n\u2018HARD TO IMAGINE\u2019\n\nTrump made his request to Zelenskiy shortly after he had frozen nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy agreed to the request on the call, and the aid was later provided. Democrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to meddle in the 2020 election for his own political benefit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more corrupt course of conduct,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nScrutiny of Pompeo\u2019s role in the administration\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, including the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Kiev earlier this year, rose after the Wall Street Journal reported that the top U.S. diplomat had listened in on the Trump-Zelenskiy call.\n\n\u201cI was on the phone call,\u201d Pompeo told reporters in Rome on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump responds to a question about Ukraine and the whistleblower report while holding a news report from the New York Times during a joint news conference with Finland's President Sauli Niinisto at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nPompeo sought to portray the call as proper, saying it was in the context of U.S. policymaking in Ukraine, including \u201ctaking down the Russia threat,\u201d rooting out corruption in government and boosting the economy.\n\nThe Democratic chairmen of three House committees have accused Pompeo of intimidating witnesses and said he was considered \u201ca fact witness\u201d in the impeachment inquiry based on his role in Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy.\n\nPompeo said State Department employees had been contacted directly by lawmakers or their staff and told not to talk to the State Department\u2019s legal counsel. He has said, however, that he would cooperate with Congress.\n\nDemocratic-led committees previously subpoenaed Pompeo and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, as well as documents.\n\nAccording to a summary of the July call released by the White House, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani. Hunter Biden had sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been under investigation by Kiev.\n\nTrump on Wednesday called Biden and his son Hunter \u201cstone-cold crooked.\u201d The president has repeatedly accused the pair of wrongdoing without providing any evidence.\n\nBiden shot back in remarks prepared for a speech in Reno, Nevada, on Wednesday night, accusing Trump of \u201cabuse of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me - I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said, according to excerpts provided by his campaign.\n\nThe prospect that Trump solicited Ukraine\u2019s help against his potential challenger next year has infuriated Democrats, many of whom blame the loss of the 2016 presidential election on Russian interference. Moscow has denied interfering in that campaign.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he saw no evidence of pressure in Trump\u2019s July conversation with Zelenskiy and added that there was nothing wrong with the U.S. president asking for an investigation into potential corruption.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies and Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with a scheme of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy and disparage his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nKurt Volker, who resigned last Friday as Trump\u2019s special representative for Ukraine, is scheduled to give a deposition to House staff on Thursday. Marie Yovanovitch, who was U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until she was abruptly recalled in May, has agreed to appear on Oct. 11. In his phone call with Zelenskiy, Trump called Yovanovitch \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a letter to the panel\u2019s chairman, Eliot Engel, that Schiff lacked jurisdiction to investigate the State Department\u2019s conduct regarding Ukraine and demanded \u201cequal representation and participation\u201d for Republicans in questioning Volker.\n\nThe impeachment probe could lead to approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove Trump from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate. Republicans, however, have shown little appetite for ousting him.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday angrily denounced an impeachment inquiry into his July telephone call with Ukraine's leader as Democratic lawmakers said they would subpoena White House records about the call.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436388605&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911QA"}
