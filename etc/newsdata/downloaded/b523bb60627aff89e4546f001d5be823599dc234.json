Elizabeth Warren has been dogged from the debate stage to town halls to late-night TV shows by questions about whether she plans to unveil a signature health-care proposal\u2014and how she would pay for expanding government-run insurance.\n\nHealth care consistently polls as the No. 1 issue Democratic voters are concerned about. But unlike her top rivals, Ms. Warren hasn\u2019t detailed her preferred policies, instead saying she\u2019s \u201cwith Bernie\u201d Sanders in supporting a government-run Medicare for All system.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s top aides have called at least one expert on single-payer health-care programs in recent weeks to discuss the costs involved. Her campaign declined to say whether it is crafting its own health-care proposal.\n\nNow, she is contesting former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s advantage or leading in polls of the field ahead of Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio. Democratic presidential campaigns are turning up the pressure on Ms. Warren to explain what she supports and how she will pay for it.\n\n\u201cI think you should be straightforward about what your plan is going to do,\u201d South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t seen that.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg, who has also called Ms. Warren \u201cextremely evasive,\u201d has aired an ad promoting his \u201cMedicare For All Who Want It\u201d health care plan and stressed in interviews that his plan wouldn\u2019t increase taxes for the middle class. Mr. Sanders has said his Medicare for All proposal would increase taxes but lower premiums. Ms. Warren hasn\u2019t been so specific about how she would pay for expanding government-run health insurance.\n\nMs. Warren co-sponsored Mr. Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All bill in the Senate, and she has repeatedly praised the legislation, even as other candidates, such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, have backed away from it after endorsing it in the Senate.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m with Bernie\u2019 is actually the most respectful position she could have,\u201d said Adam Green, a Warren ally, adding \u201cthere is a strategy there.\u201d\n\nMr. Green, co-founder of a liberal PAC, the Progressive Campaign Change Committee, said Ms. Warren supports Medicare for All as a goal but thinks how to get there is still up for debate. \u201cAt this point, she\u2019s the only candidate left standing who is with him on Medicare for All, meaning she will actually fight for a true version of it,\u201d Mr. Green said.\n\nMs. Warren discussed Medicare for All legislation with Sen. Bernie Sanders on Capitol Hill last year. Ms. Warren called Medicare for All a \u2018framework\u2019 at a recent town hall.

It\u2019s a 100-page bill,\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019 senior policy adviser Warren Gunnels tweeted in response. Mr. Sanders has mostly held off directly criticizing Ms. Warren.\n\nMs. Warren frequently talks on the campaign trail about how her proposed wealth tax would pay for student-loan debt cancellation and several other priorities. She has also outlined other ways to pay for new programs, such as using taxes on high-income Americans to extend the life of the Social Security trust fund.\n\nBut on health care, she speaks with less specificity. \u201cThe overall structure is that the very wealthy and big corporations will see their costs go up, but middle-class families will see their costs go down,\u201d Ms. Warren told reporters in Los Angeles last week. \u201cThat is how [middle-class families] frame the problem: what their costs will be. And their costs will go down.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren hasn\u2019t said whether middle-class taxes would increase because the exact cost of Medicare for All is unclear, given that there are several versions of the framework produced by lawmakers and economists, according to a person familiar with the senator\u2019s thinking. This person said the senator has chosen to stick to the broader principle that overall costs will go down and that the wealthy will pay more.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Would you support a higher tax bill if it was offset by lower health-care costs? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nRobert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a supporter of Medicare for All, said all of the prominent proposals would lead to some increase in taxes for most Americans. However, he agreed with Ms. Warren that most Americans care about lowering their overall costs more than keeping a private insurance plan.\n\nMr. Pollin said senior Warren campaign policy staffers have called him in recent weeks asking questions about different ways to finance Medicare for All. He declined to go into specifics. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they started to get in touch with me, but it\u2019s really been just a couple of phone calls,\u201d Mr. Pollin said.\n\nMr. Biden, who has aired ads touting his more incremental approach to health care, has taken aim at Ms. Warren for not explaining how she would pay for Medicare for All. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Trump by not being straightforward,\u201d he said in an exchange with a Warren supporter at a stop in Iowa.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s at least acknowledge, let\u2019s tell Elizabeth it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money, and she\u2019s going to raise people\u2019s taxes doing it,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Warren was pressed on how to pay for government-run insurance in late September by Stephen Colbert during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show.\u201d Asked the same question by a New Hampshire voter last month, Ms. Warren responded that the U.S. \u201ccan afford health care for our citizens,\u201d saying \u201creally wealthy people are going to see their costs go up.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ken Thomas contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com and Tarini Parti at Tarini.Parti@wsj.com", "description": "Sen.
