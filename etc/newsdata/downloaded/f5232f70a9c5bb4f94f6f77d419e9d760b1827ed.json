(Jan-Michael Stump/Traverse City Record-Eagle/AP)\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos, appearing Tuesday at a D.C. think tank with presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway, called her $5 billion federal tax credit plan that would fund scholarships to private and religious schools \u201cthe conservative answer to what ails American education.\u201d And she said, incorrectly, that it won\u2019t cost the government any money to implement.\n\nDeVos and Conway appeared at the conservative American Enterprise Institute (see video below) for a discussion about the Trump administration\u2019s Education Freedom Scholarships proposal. The scholarships would be funded by individuals and businesses who want to privately donate but who would then receive a federal tax credit for doing so.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s 2020 budget plan includes $5 billion to pay for those tax credits, on a dollar-for-dollar basis: A dollar for a scholarship gets you a $1 tax credit. (The president\u2019s budget proposal also would cut Education Department spending by nearly $9 billion. Congress is not expected to approve the tax credit program or the budget cuts.)\n\nDeVos has been clear since becoming education secretary in 2017 that her chief priority was expanding alternatives to traditional public schools, which she once called \u201ca dead end.\u201d As she has in the past, DeVos on Tuesday hailed the proposal as one that would not take money away from public schools, and this time she said it wouldn\u2019t use any \u201cgovernment money\u201d \u2014 even though the $5 billion used to cover tax credits means government money would be involved.\n\nShe said:\n\nOur Education Freedom Scholarships proposal . . . doesn\u2019t grow the government bureaucracy one tiny bit. . . . It doesn\u2019t impose any new requirements on states or on families. It doesn\u2019t take a single dollar from public school students, and it doesn\u2019t spend a single dollar of government money. And it doesn\u2019t entangle schools with federal strings or stifling red tape. In fact, it can\u2019t. And that\u2019s by design.\n\nThe Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDeVos\u2019s comments \u2014 including this one: \u201cBig union bullying is \u2026 unfair to the many students and parents who simply want better futures for their sons and daughters\u201d \u2014 drew angry responses from leaders of the two major teachers unions in the nation.\n\nDeVos on opposition to Education Freedom Scholarships and private education options from teachers unions: \u201cUnion bosses don\u2019t put kids first... they put themselves first.\u201d #atmedillonthehill \u2014 Brian Johnson (@BrianJo62574390) October 1, 2019\n\nLily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the National Education Association, the largest labor union in the United States, said in a statement about the DeVos-Conway appearance:\n\nBetsy DeVos and Kellyanne Conway are probably the two least qualified people in America to talk about how to best help students succeed. Today, by once again pushing the Trump Administration\u2019s plans to cut $5 billion from public schools to fund private and religious schools through failed voucher schemes, DeVos and Conway proved how completely out of touch they are with what students need.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the second-largest teachers union, said in a statement:\n\nBetsy is taking a page out of the president\u2019s playbook by calling people names when things aren\u2019t going well. It\u2019s so disappointing that, once again, she has betrayed her responsibilities as secretary of education to foster safe and welcoming environments for students and to resist the divisiveness and polarization enabled by her boss.\n\nDuring the event at the think tank, DeVos made remarks and participated in a panel discussion about the scholarships. She said:\n\nEducation Freedom Scholarships are the conservative answer to what ails American education. They also happen to be the answer that a super-majority of parents, particularly African American and Hispanic parents, say they\u2019re looking for.\n\nActually, different surveys show different things about who supports vouchers and by what percentage.\n\n[Betsy DeVos\u2019s claim about public funding for \u2018Education Freedom Scholarships\u2019]\n\nIn April, The Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed remarks DeVos made that public schools would not lose a single dollar to the program should it be approved by Congress and said:\n\nBut these seem like distinctions without a difference. What\u2019s being proposed is a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, meaning taxpayers would end up footing the cost of the scholarships (albeit indirectly and capped at $5 billion) even if the private sector is fronting the money. Meanwhile, the Education Department is justifying the proposed cuts to its budget in terms of \u201cfiscal discipline\u201d and \u201cthe President\u2019s overall goal of increasing support for national security and public safety without adding to the Federal budget deficit.\u201d DeVos and the Trump administration are choosing to fund the tax credits while choosing to cut the department\u2019s programs.\n\nIt also said that federal taxpayer money would be used to pay for the tax credits:", "description": "What it would really cost.", "authors": ["Valerie Strauss", "Reporter Covering Education", "Foreign Affairs", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xbqoa8gB3-dbV3iOc8gNhl09LJ0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3GLT7RG3EMI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
