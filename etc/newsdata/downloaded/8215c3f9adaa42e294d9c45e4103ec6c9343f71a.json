My wife and three children, I am happy for them to come and witness history.\n\n\u2018The positively of sport, I want to make it a clean sport and an interesting sport.\u2019\n\nEliud Kipchoge was helped round the course in Vienna by a group of 41 pacemakers (Picture: Getty)\n\nKipchoge\u2019s shot at history was engineered by British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, whose Ineos company helped fund and set-up the race and its conditions in Vienna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That last kilometre where he actually accelerated was super human,\u2019 said Ratcliffe.\n\n\u2018He ran the first half marathon in under an hour and then he had to do it again.\n\n\u2018Everything has to go right to do this. It\u2019s so nice to see the \u2018pacers\u2019 be part of this \u2013 they are just so full of enthusiasm.\u2019", "description": "Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge has achieved one of the greatest athletic feats of all-time by becoming the first man in history to run a sub two-hour marathon.
