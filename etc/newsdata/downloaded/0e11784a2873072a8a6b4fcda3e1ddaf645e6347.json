Workers making $40,000 -- the company's current minimum salary -- would get an immediate $10,000 raise and that within five years, the minimum salary would increase to $70,000.\n\nGravity Payments, a Seattle-based credit card processing company, recently acquired ChargeItPro in Eagle, Idaho, and the group moved into a new office space. Gravity Payments CEO Dan Price flew in to welcome employees to the new office -- and then stunned them with the news that a majority of the employees would get a $10,000 pay bump effective immediately and the minimum salary for employees would rise to $70,000 by 2024.\n\nA majority of the employees were making under $30,000 prior to the acquisition, according to Price.\n\nBringing our $70,000 minimum wage to the heartland today.

We\u2019re growing and thriving as a business, we\u2019re not taking outside money, we\u2019re not taking donations,\" he added. \"We\u2019re succeeding as a business doing this.\"\n\nGravity Payments works to \"make payment processing fair for small- and medium-sized businesses,\" according to Price, who said that they are also now working with software companies to develop solutions that help small businesses process payments so that people's interactions with their customers don't simply revolve around money.\n\nPrice said he has seen his employees' lives change dramatically since he rolled out the new salaries at his Seattle branch, saying, \"we went from having zero to two babies born per year to having over 30 babies born.\"\n\nHe added that he feels it's \"surprising and a bit disturbing\" that more companies haven't followed suit in redistributing profits.\n\n\"I'm just shocked at the lack of willingness to do this, especially in big companies in corporate America,\" he added. \"We\u2019ve proven that this can work.\"\n\nWhile he acknowledges that it is hard for small businesses and \"we need to be really nice to our small business owners,\" he says there is no excuse for some of the bigger guys.\n\n\"Any company that is making over a million dollars a year in profit absolutely should be doing this,\" he said. \"The inequality needs to stop.\"", "description": "CEO Dan Price said he felt it was", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/dan-price-file-gty-jef-190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
