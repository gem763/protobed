My left index finger recoiled a bit as it reached for the \u201cT\u201d on the keyboard. But it\u2019s true for this reason: Democrats are too earnest. They care too much. They\u2019re too smart. They know too much.\n\nWhoever says, as Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) did, \u201cThe American people are so much better than this\u201d needs to get out more.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to recommend that primary candidates should be more like President Trump, not that they could. But, as a panel of candidates, they\u2019re missing a key element essential to voter interest. Not brilliant policies or the rote delivery of statistics but a clear and firm message as well as that other thing that Trump had in 2016 \u2014 \u201cit.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re used to saying \u201cit girl,\u201d but boys have \u201cit,\u201d too. And \u201cit\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily good. In fact, in men, it\u2019s probably just a little bit bad. Bad enough to attract attention, to convey toughness, to seduce with dazzle or at least bedevil those around him. Love him or hate him \u2014 or just wish him away \u2014 Trump has the X factor in spades and jokers.\n\nYes, yes, many Americans are surely ready for something different. But a Trump-like figure in the mix gives everyone a point of reference for contrasts and pivots.\n\nAs elder statesman and Democratic front-runner, Joe Biden was the obvious person to serve this role, but he\u2019s the opposite of the brooding, sarcastic, hunkering Trump we saw during the 2016 campaign. Whereas Trump was the impudent scoundrel, dominating the Republican field with the aloof self-confidence of an undefeated bully, Biden is the welcome guy at Walmart who wants to give everybody a great, big ol\u2019 hug.\n\nThree years ago, Trump knew nothing, of course, but he made certain that viewers would not be bored. He hurled glib insults and tagged better men with insulting (but largely accurate) nicknames \u2014 and the crowds loved him. Today, Democratic contenders are so busy trying to demonstrate how un-Trump they are that they risk putting everyone to sleep. Be honest. Did you make it to the end of Thursday night\u2019s three-hour affair?\n\nAlso missing from the mix is a jester to the king. For Republicans during the 2016 cycle, it was Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.). Barely registering in the polls, Graham was so liberated by the impossibility of his nomination that he said only true things, including that Trump was a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic bigot\u201d and \u201cjackass.\u201d We watched the \u201ckids table\u201d GOP debates before the top guns just to find out what Graham would say. Miss that guy.\n\nOn Thursday, the zany Andrew Yang did offer some comic relief when he said, \u201cI\u2019m Asian, so I know a lot of doctors,\u201d thus supposedly making him an expert on health care. Otherwise, he was plainly auditioning for a game show of his own. He offered to give $1,000 a month to 10 families for a year to show how his guaranteed minimum income policy would work. He also suggested giving all Americans 100 \u201cdemocracy dollars\u201d to spend on political causes.\n\nFormer HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro was laughable if not funny when he tried to make Biden look little. Fuming mad in that studied, must-show-passion way, Castro jabbed the former vice president for \u201cforgetting\u201d what he had just said, which wasn\u2019t true, but Castro was brandishing his narrative as the Latino, new-generation tough guy. It backfired.\n\nHonorable mention goes to former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who broke out with his strongest stand yet on gun control: \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he intoned, sounding very fierce. Also noteworthy, Biden earned a new voter bloc among the incarcerated population when he said, \u201cNobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime.\u201d\n\nIn sum: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was very Bernie. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) was A-plus perfect. Harris was prosecutorial. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) was bookishly faithful to his narrative. Biden was grown-up. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) was emphatically moderate, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the Mr. Rogers of American politics, would make everything tidy.\n\nEntertainment value, obviously, should play no part in a voter\u2019s calculation. But as all public speakers know, audiences don\u2019t remember what you said; they remember how you made them feel. Trump made people feel excited, if for all the wrong reasons. This crew? Serotonin on the rocks without a twist.\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.", "description": "Democratic contenders are so busy trying to prove how un-Trump they are that they risk putting everyone to sleep.", "authors": ["Kathleen Parker", "Columnist Covering Politics", "September At Pm", "Kathleen Parker Writes A Twice-Weekly Column On Politics", "Culture.
