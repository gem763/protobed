In placing the track at this key point, Lynch banked on the audience\u2019s prior knowledge of Reed as a sort of back-alley Johnny Cash \u2014 just the guy who could drive home the film\u2019s themes of obsession, danger, and paranoia. He banked, in other words, on Lou Reed\u2019s iconic status having become self-evident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the half-dozen years since Reed\u2019s death, a number of biographers have attempted to come to grips with that status. Fans of the songwriter rate him as one of the best lyricists in the pop-rock milieu: if not quite at the level of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, then at least not ashamed to stand in their company. Despite a lack of commercial success at the time, Reed and his band, the Velvet Underground, provided a needed counterweight to the hippie ethos of the 1960s, exploring darker and arguably more substantive themes than what was typically on offer in the Summer of Love. \u201cLet\u2019s just say we were a little bit sarcastic about the love thing,\u201d Reed later said. \u201cWhich we were right about, because look what happened.\u201d (Presumably he was referring to the Altamont debacle and the Manson murders.) But Lou\u2019s detractors have some ammunition: The awful-to-good ratio of his recorded output is higher than it ought to be; his lyrics are preoccupied with drugs, violence, and extreme sex to a degree that seems to go beyond journalistic curiosity; and that singing voice, particularly in the later years, is not for everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHoward Sounes\u2019s The Life of Lou Reed: Notes from the Velvet Underground, recently published in the U.S., ought to command respect from both camps. It is the clearest-eyed assessment of Reed to date. Taking the measure of a life marked by perpetual conflict and bridge-burning, Sounes leaves final judgments of Reed\u2019s character to the reader. Was he a monster or a troubled man with a good heart? It depends on how you weigh the various incidents described in the book, and whether you buy into the narrative that Reed became more settled in later years. On these questions Sounes remains on the fence. Describing his subject\u2019s twin inclinations toward generosity and cruelty, Sounes observes, with characteristic understatement, \u201cSo we see two sides to the man, apparently contradictory, but nonetheless part of his character.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounes is equally restrained in his assessment of the music. It is precisely because he takes Reed seriously as a songwriter and musician that he finds so much of the discography lacking. During the five-year period in the 1960s when Lou was an active member of the Velvet Underground, he was, in Sounes\u2019s estimation, \u201ca serious artist,\u201d penning an impressive array of material that included such affecting ballads as \u201cFemme Fatale,\u201d \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d and \u201cPale Blue Eyes\u201d; the effervescent rock anthems \u201cWhat Goes On,\u201d \u201cSweet Jane,\u201d and \u201cRock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\u201d; and nods to transgressive sex (\u201cVenus in Furs\u201d and \u201cSome Kinda Love\u201d). But his reputation and notoriety rest primarily on two tracks: \u201cHeroin\u201d and \u201cWaiting for the Man,\u201d both of which describe the highs and lows of hard-drug use in explicit detail. To those who felt that this material glorified drug abuse, Reed responded that he was merely bringing a level of realism to rock songwriting that had been present in literary fiction for decades. A Syracuse alumnus (B.A. in English with philosophy minor) and onetime prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of poet and short-story writer Delmore Schwartz, Lou knew something of which he spoke.\n\nAcademic credentials notwithstanding, the argument of authorly impartiality became less convincing as Reed\u2019s solo career got under way and he took to miming the experience of shooting drugs onstage with a real syringe and tourniquet. By this point, Sounes opines, Reed had become a \u201cself-parody,\u201d a man adrift who routinely substituted shock value for artistry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat solo career was distinguished by two strong albums early on \u2014 Transformer (which featured the hit \u201cWalk on the Wild Side\u201d) and Berlin \u2014 followed by a long stretch of wildly uneven material that was not truly broken until 1989\u2019s critically lauded album, New York. Even then, Sounes maintains, Reed was not quite hitting his Velvet Underground heights. The songwriter had by then incorporated politics into his work, with mixed results. Songs for Drella, a 1990 collaboration with Velvet Underground co-founder John Cale that eulogized the Velvets\u2019 onetime friend and benefactor Andy Warhol, comes in for fuller praise, as does Reed\u2019s 1992 solo album Magic and Loss. Sounes is generally warm toward Reed\u2019s later work because it seems to have been animated by a creative restlessness and an admirable desire to bring rock music out of its perpetual adolescence. Thus, a head-scratching project such as Lulu, Reed\u2019s 2009 collaboration with Metallica, earns a measure of respect. \u201cIt was reassuring, in a way, that his last record turned out to be a wild one,\u201d Sounes writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounes has a reputation for dogged research, and The Life of Lou Reed excels when it ventures off the beaten path and digs deep. The Syracuse years get thorough treatment, and this material goes a long way in explaining the zigzag life that followed. We learn, for instance, that Lou was hung up on his college girlfriend Shelley Albin, the muse who inspired \u201cPale Blue Eyes.\u201d \u201cIf Shelley would just come back, it\u2019d be all right,\u201d Reed sang on an early version of his song \u201cI Can\u2019t Stand It.\u201d And, indeed, Reed apparently pined for a reconciliation with Albin well into middle age. But of course it would not have been all right if Shelley had just come back. \u201cI was crazy about him,\u201d Albin tells Sounes. But \u201cI had an innate sense, This is not someone you want to have kids with.\u201d It\u2019s not hyperbole to say that Lou\u2019s demons had demons, each of which the book covers in detail. There was a deeply conflicted sexuality (\u201cbisexual\u201d is too serene a term for it); a voracious appetite for drugs and alcohol; the two dozen electro-shock treatments he endured in his late teens for antisocial behavior; a propensity for physical and verbal abuse; an alleged bipolar diagnosis at midlife; and, perhaps most troubling, a lifelong rage he harbored for his father that virtually all of his biographers, friends and exes, and his sister believe to have been largely groundless. Two marriages were sacrificed to this maelstrom (a third, to musician Laurie Anderson, proved more enduring), as were countless friendships and professional relationships. But it also produced some extraordinary music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt could be argued that this is the sort of story that writes itself. Even so, Sounes proves the most reliable and entertaining of Reed\u2019s biographers. He is not above expressing exasperation at his subject; and, indeed, his writing catches extra fire at such moments. But in the main he is the unflappable center at the heart of a hurricane. For adventurous souls wishing to delve into the turbulent life of a difficult but hugely influential artist, The Life of Lou Reed: Notes from the Velvet Underground is the definitive account. It explains why we all should care.\n\nThis article appears as \u201cThe Turbulent Lou Reed\u201d in the October 14, 2019, print edition of National Review.", "description": "A review of 'The Life of Lou Reed: Notes from the Velvet Underground,' by Howard Sounes", "authors": ["Robert Dean Lurie", "Kyle Smith", "Kevin D.
