I think it was a little overdue.\"\n\nQuinn Hughes was a first-round selection by Vancouver in 2018. There were approximately 80 Hughes family members and friends on hand for their first NHL matchup.\n\nNew Jersey went ahead to stay on Hughes' power-play goal 14:08 into the first period. Taylor Hall kept the puck on his stick while eluding two defenders and fired cross ice to Hughes, who beat Canucks goalie Thatcher Demko.\n\n\"It's such an awesome feeling,\" Jack Hughes said. \"To come out here and play in front of my family and friends. It's nice to be able to beat Quinn. The two games we've won, we've played much better hockey.\"\n\nDemko finished with 23 saves for Vancouver, which had won four in a row.\n\nBlackwood was especially stingy in the second period, when he turned aside 14 shots, including three in a frantic 43-second stretch.\n\nWith seven minutes left, Elias Pettersson fired a high shot that Blackwood pushed off the crossbar. Then he stopped Alexander Edler on a breakaway after Edler left the penalty box. The rebound bounced out to Edler, who fired it through the crease.\n\nWATCH | Blackwood, Devils black the Canucks:\n\nJack Hughes scored the lone goal in New Jersey's 1-0 victory over Vancouver on Saturday. 1:14\n\n\"Everyone is out there playing for each other,\" Blackwood said. \"No one is being selfish. Everyone is out there doing their jobs. We feed off each other's energy. When one guy is going well, then the other goes well and it becomes contagious. That helps the goaltender a lot.\"\n\nThe Devils' penalty killers had another solid performance, killing off six power plays two days after killing off seven straight chances against the New York Rangers. The Devils allowed eight power-play goals over their first six losses of the season.\n\n\"The penalty kill is because of an attention to detail,\" Devils coach John Hynes said. \"We've been able to clear pucks from our zone. We've been able to maintain pressure up ice. In the games we hadn't won, it was the little things that we didn't do. I think we're more consistent.\"", "description": "Jack Hughes scored his first career goal in his first NHL game against his older brother Quinn Hughes, and the New Jersey Devils beat the visiting Vancouver Canucks 1-0 on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5327785.1571514033!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hughes-jack-191019-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
