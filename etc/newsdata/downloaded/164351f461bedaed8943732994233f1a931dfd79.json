It\u2019s possible that the events in \u201cNeighbors and Friends\u201d could be setting up a dazzling payoff \u2014 the hazards of reviewing episode by episode \u2014 but it\u2019s nonetheless a letdown after the first five episodes of the series were so committed to getting into the headspace of Miles, Miles 2.0, and, finally, Kate, who had such a strong showing in \u201cVa Bene.\u201d Shifting to some corporate intrigue about Hillston Telecom adds a moral component to show, but for now, the entire subplot is feeling less essential.\n\n\u201cNeighbors and Friends\u201d starts with an ominous cold open that feels like it\u2019s out of Michael Haneke\u2019s domestic thriller Cach\u00e9, or maybe an episode of Amazon\u2019s Homecoming. With eerie music underscoring the sequence, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris show the delivery of a crate that has the height and width of a coffin, and the slow surveillance pan out reinforces that impression, along with a title sequence that glitches up the letters. We don\u2019t discover until the last few minutes what\u2019s inside the crate, but the opening does set the tone for an episode where Miles attempts some corporate subterfuge to save his job, but opens himself up to dangerous blowback in the process.\n\nIn the meantime, Miles has returned to a dreary new normal with Kate, which looks like the old normal \u2014 a lot of checking smartphones during breakfast \u2014 but with a note of desperation on his part. He knows he\u2019s been a disappointment to her and he\u2019s trying to change his behavior a little, but he doesn\u2019t know that Kate\u2019s head is somewhere else. She\u2019s headed to the city for a week for a design conference that\u2019s really a retreat into the arms of Miles 2.0, who also happens to have tucked a spare $20,000 into their special account to make them whole again. Five days later, Miles gets a call from the fertility clinic about an appointment, but for once he doesn\u2019t cancel. His cloning screw-up, and the continued presence of Miles 2.0 somewhere in the world, has lit a small, toasty fire under his behind. He may not have Miles 2.0\u2019s joie de vivre, but he recognizes that he can no longer get away with going through the motions.\n\n(Speaking of motions, the scene where Miles chooses \u201ca stimulatory aid from the hand terminal\u201d for masturbation purposes recalls Paul Rudd\u2019s turn in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, when he decides to further along his middle-aged friend\u2019s sexual development with a big box of porn.)\n\nThe majority of \u201cNeighbors and Friends,\u201d however, is given over to a rural town-hall meeting where a community chooses between two different telecom companies, Hillston and Broadspan, for the leasing of space for a cellphone tower. Miles rushes over to the town hall after getting word that Miles 2.0 has been flaking, but his motive for going is mostly to see his clone\u2019s cheesy marketing campaign crash and burn in the real world. (Contacted by the Gold Pencil Award after his company submitted it for consideration, Miles is aghast: \u201cSeriously? That sappy piece of shit?\u201d) And crash and burn it does, as farmers rightly blanch at offers of milk and cookies at the door and pablum in the promotional advertisement like \u201cOur state-of-the-art fiber connections have nothing on the connections between hearts.\u201d\n\nBut Miles\u2019s attitude shifts when he overhears that his job is in jeopardy if Hillston fails to secure the deal. So he takes an anecdote from an agriculture magazine as his own, claiming his grandfather was a farmer who may have gotten cancer from a foreign cell phone tower on his land, and winds up winning the votes he needs over Broadspan. A Broadspan suit recognizes the story as nonsense and threatens libel after tossing a little piss in his direction, and his farmer buddy Ray learns about the ruse too late. (\u201cSad thing is, I pegged you for a pervert and a fool, but not a liar.\u201d) Miles\u2019s massive moral and ethical lapse in this situation brings us back to the cloning issue, which is a moral and ethical landmine all its own. What does it say about Miles that he\u2019s capable of this kind of duplicity and underhandedness? When the going gets tough for him, he seems willing to do anything.\n\n\u201cNeighbors and Friends\u201d isn\u2019t as compelling as the previous episodes, but it does the grunt work of setting up the final two, which appear to be taking a drastically darker turn. There\u2019s some irony \u2014 and poetic justice \u2014 to the implication that Miles\u2019s duplicity is coming back to haunt him in the form of his clone, who\u2019s the last person he see before someone throws a black covering on his head and presumably abducts him on Miles 2.0\u2019s direction. The motives for the kidnapping are not entirely clear \u2014 could have something to do with Hillston, could have something to do with Kate, could be something else entirely \u2014 but there\u2019s really no scenario that could put Miles 2.0 in a heroic light. And while Miles didn\u2019t know his spa treatment was actually a cloning procedure at the time, that moment now seems like the original sin that has put a series of troubling events in motion. He\u2019s not done getting punished for it.\n\nDouble Yous\n\n\u2022 Pig cloning makes Hillston\u2019s gift to Miles all the more symbolically significant. This 2014 article from BBC claims that China is cloning them on \u201can industrial scale.\u201d The implications are not promising.\n\n\u2022 Can anyone confirm that fertility clinics have giant pictures of babies in rooms intended for masturbation? Because that seems not helpful as a mood-setter.\n\n\u2022 The slogan \u201cWe know you\u201d from the \u201cFriends and Neighbors\u201d campaign veers awfully close to \u201cWe here for you\u201d from Succession. Both have a creepy corporate intimacy to them.\n\n\u2022 Pissing on someone from an adjacent urinal is a classic alpha move. Gotta mark your territory.
