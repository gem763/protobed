Shaun the Sheep.\n\nHis first film, 2015\u2019s Shaun the Sheep Movie, took \u00a3100million at the box office and gained 49 award nominations across the globe, including an Oscar nod.\n\nSo Aardman Animations have decided to take their much-loved character on an intergalactic adventure.\n\nA Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon has the woolly star trying to shepherd alien Lu-La back to her home planet.\n\nThis rocket-fuelled journey of excitement, emotion and fun was created at a small studio in Bristol.\n\nWhen we visit, we are first greeted by a giant Wallace, one of Aardman\u2019s first successes who with trusty \u2013 and much wiser \u2013 sidekick Gromit, debuted in 1989\u2019s A Grand Day Out.\n\nOur first stop is the set of Mossingham Supermarket, where Shaun takes Lu-La for a snack. Computers create so much cinema these days but not here.\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\nThey use old-fashioned stop motion where characters are moved tiny amounts between individually photographed frames, which are played back at speed to create the illusion of movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hard work,\u201d says animator, Carmen Bromfield-Mason.\n\n\u201cWe had over 20 animators working at full capacity and we were expected to make, on average, two seconds of animation a day.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like very much. But everybody just keeps going and when you have worked like that for about a year and a half, you end up with a feature film.\u201d\n\nMost challenging for animators is to make the characters show emotions, particularly in a film without dialogue.\n\nCarmen explains: \u201cShaun doesn\u2019t have eyebrows but eyelids make a difference to show if he\u2019s angry or sad.\u201d\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\nAnd the animators also use old-fashioned techniques to create water and fire. Even the bins are made out of cola cans.\n\nCarmen says: \u201cPeople use cling film for water and bubbles are glass beads.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019re a huge company, we keep things low-tech. It\u2019s the closest thing to magic that I can do.\u201d\n\nNext, we head to the puppet-making studio. While I desperately grapple with plasticine in a bid to make my own Lu-La, Will Harding, who has worked in the business for 15 years, makes it look easy.\n\nHe says: \u201cModels can take anywhere between a couple of weeks and a month to make.\n\n\u201cWe do quite a lot of research into the materials and test them to see if they work on camera. So, for Shaun\u2019s wool we actually had to stiffen the material as we didn\u2019t want it to become too fluffy.\u201d\n\nThe film has already been compared to Stranger Things and ET. Producer Paul Kewley admits: \u201cWe love all those references, but, we want to be unique and feel like Farmageddon is its own thing.\n\n\u201cMy favourite new character is Lu-La \u2013 she is engaging, warm and exciting.\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\n(Image: \u00a9 2018 Aardman Animations Limited and Studiocanal S.A.S.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard finding actors for characters that don\u2019t have much dialogue and a lot of actors who have tried it found it harder than they expected.\n\n\u201cJustin Fletcher and John Sparkes, who play Shaun and Bitzer, are just brilliant. You tell them something and they come up with the sounds. It\u2019s an extraordinary thing to see\u201d\n\nYes, that\u2019s children\u2019s TV superstar Justin Fletcher \u2013 aka Mr Tumble \u2013 who voices (bleats) Shaun.\n\nThese aren\u2019t the only sounds in the film which are unique \u2013 with the soundtrack being headed up by big names such as Kylie and The Vaccines.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAnd look out for a few starry cameos. Paul says: \u201cJoe Sugg agreed to play the pizza boy and is fantastic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also got Professor Brian Cox, who does a cameo.\u201d\n\nDirectors Will Becher and Rich Phelan, agree the inspiration for the storyline \u2013apart from the alien presumably \u2013 comes from \u201ctheir own lives\u201d.\n\nRich says despite the aliens it has a much more human meaning. He adds: \u201cThe core of the story is just about two best friends having an adventure.\u201d\n\nA Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon is out in cinemas now.", "description": "The family-friendly adventure came together at a small studio in Bristol", "authors": ["Poppy Danby", "Image", "Handout", "Aardman Animations Limited", "Studiocanal S.A.S."], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20639008.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_STSM2_First_Look_WIDE_FINALJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
