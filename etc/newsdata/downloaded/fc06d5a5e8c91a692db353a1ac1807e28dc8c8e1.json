That doesn\u2019t mean they were wrong.", "language": "en", "text": "The third game of this National League Division Series \u2014 which goes down as a 10-4 victory for the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 was set up as the Nationals wanted it Sunday night. They got five stunning innings from starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez. They got a two-run bomb in the first from Juan Soto. They had both a lead and a juiced Nationals Park behind them. They had two left-handed Dodgers coming up to start the sixth.\n\nIt was the time to turn to Corbin, the lefty who threw the first pitch of the series for the Nats. It was the right move \u2014 and because Manager Dave Martinez made it, Washington has a much tougher path toward winning this series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCorbin\u2019s line: two outs, six runs, loss.\n\nGood call. Terrible ramifications. Both can be true.\n\n\u201cThe plan was good,\u201d General Manager Mike Rizzo said. \u201cThe result wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPatrick Corbin, Nationals get rocked by Dodgers in sixth inning, lose NLDS Game 3, 10-4\n\nRemember that Washington got to the division series and arrived at Game 3 tied with the 106-win Dodgers because it had covered its house-afire bullpen with stud starters Stephen Strasburg and Max Scherzer coming on in relief. Let\u2019s not re-engineer this in hindsight. That\u2019s the Nats\u2019 path. It\u2019s overgrown and rocky, but all they can do is put on their hiking boots, get out their weed whacker and try to forge ahead.\n\nMartinez\u2019s decision Sunday night wasn\u2019t whether to use Corbin. It was when. In some ways, S\u00e1nchez made that difficult on his skipper. After a shaky leave-the-bases-loaded first inning, S\u00e1nchez did precisely what he was asked. He cruised through five innings. After the first, he made just one real mistake \u2014 an 0-2 fastball that Max Muncy drove out of the yard in the fifth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut in the bottom of the fifth with one out and a man on first in a game his team led 2-1, Martinez had to decide: pinch-hit Ryan Zimmerman for S\u00e1nchez and try to extend the lead, thus turning to Corbin, or send up S\u00e1nchez to bunt, then back out to the mound after 87 pitches to face those two Dodgers lefties, MVP candidate Cody Bellinger and shortstop Corey Seager.\n\nBefore you spend all day screaming to your office mates, \u201cHe should have stuck with S\u00e1nchez!\u201d consider that the \u00ad\u00ad35-year-old was already trying to navigate the Dodgers\u2019 lineup for a third time. Opposing hitters\u2019 on-base-plus-slugging percentage against S\u00e1nchez the first time through the lineup: .587. Their OPS the second time through: .702. Their OPS the third time through: .923. Had S\u00e1nchez remained in and coughed it up, those screams to your office mates could have been, \u201cHow could he stick with S\u00e1nchez?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to do something,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said, \u201cto make a move.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI trust Pat,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe\u2019s been unbelievable all year. And I would do it again. I really would.\u201d\n\nSo it was Corbin\u2019s turn to impersonate some combination of Strasburg from the wild-card game against Milwaukee (three scoreless innings) and Scherzer from Game 2 in L.A. (striking out the side in the eighth inning of a two-run game). What we learned from Corbin\u2019s appearance: What Strasburg and Scherzer did over the past week was extraordinary.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a matter of Corbin, who threw 107 pitches over six innings in Game 1 three days earlier, simply not having it. His line is impossibly ugly. His experience was that he was a pitch away from extracting himself \u2014 a million times.\n\nAD\n\nHe got two strikes on Bellinger \u2014 who singled. He struck out the next two men. He induced a groundball from David Freese \u2014 which bounced through the hole on the right side of the infield. He put Russell Martin in an 0-2 hole, threw two balls \u2014 and allowed a go-ahead double to the gap in left-center. After a walk, he put Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez in yet another 0-2 hole, missed with his next pitch \u2014 and then gave up his second two-run double.\n\nAD\n\nFinish Bellinger, he had a 1-2-3 inning, and the Nats\u2019 strategy would have been putting pressure on the Dodgers. Finish Martin, and the lead is preserved. Finish Hern\u00e1ndez, and it\u2019s still a one-run game.\n\n\u201cIt just stinks,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cI feel like I let these guys down.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHow unlikely was this outcome? During the regular season, Corbin put 182 hitters in 0-2 holes. Three managed doubles. Three managed homers. Their collective production: an .094 average, a .164 slugging percentage and 109 strikeouts. He is a good pitcher with the stuff \u2014 particularly a wipeout slider \u2014 to finish hitters off.\n\nNormally. The playoffs, in relief, were not normal.\n\nShoot, even Wander Suero got ahead of Justin Turner 0-2. So, naturally, Turner took three straight balls, then deposited the pitch that turned a ballgame into a blowout into the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen. It was 8-2.\n\nAD\n\nThe shame of it for the Nats is that Voldemort \u2014 sorry, sorry Strickland \u2014 and Suero and Tanner Rainey and Fernando Rodney could have provided an 8-2 deficit without much effort, and at least the Nats would have had Corbin in the tank \u2014 either in relief of Scherzer on Monday or backing up Strasburg in Game 5. Now, the path forward is considerably murkier.\n\nAD\n\nIt starts with Scherzer \u2014 and could include Strasburg. \u201cAll hands on deck,\u201d Martinez said. But this is uncharted territory. Scherzer doesn\u2019t know what sort of impact those 13 mesmerizing pitches will have on his abilities, his stamina, his effectiveness Monday night. Could he go 80 pitches? Ninety? One hundred?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what the number is right now,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of out the door.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s also out the door: the idea that the Nats\u2019 creative use of their best weapons could send the Dodgers back to L.A. not for a fifth game, but for the winter. What they need now is for Scherzer to somehow pitch like he hasn\u2019t recently, to go deep into the game. Then Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson would somehow have to finish it off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBecause if that happens, the Nats would have Strasburg on full rest in a Game 5 on Wednesday in Los Angeles. With, perhaps, Corbin behind him \u2014 as long as Sunday didn\u2019t scare them off. They now have information about Corbin on short rest and as a reliever. That the information is ugly can\u2019t change the thought process.\n\nBlame all the relievers who failed here this season \u2014 Tony Sipp and Trevor Rosenthal, Kyle Barraclough and Dan Jennings, we could go on and on \u2014 for putting the Nats in this position. Don\u2019t blame Dave Martinez for following the only script that has a chance to provide the Nats a happy ending \u2014 even though it didn\u2019t work out, and the job got harder because of it.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nInside the Nationals\u2019 gutsy Game 2 pitching plan that evened the NLDS\n\nHow the Nationals have limited Cody Bellinger, likely NL MVP, in the NLDS\n\nJuan Soto is a very quick learner.
