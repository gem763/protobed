That's not the way it played out. In some ways, I signed up for this knowing when you draft a young quarterback, this can happen. ... Knew it was a possibility. Just said, 'hey I'll handle it. I'll support Daniel,' do what I'm told. ... When you're a football player, you do what you're told.\"\n\nFavre does have his own experience as an aging quarterback starting ahead of a first-round draft pick. He was never replaced during the season, but the Green Bay Packers finally decided to go with Aaron Rodgers in 2008 by trading the three-time NFL MVP to the New York Jets.\n\nThings worked out well for all parties in that instance, as Favre was able to help the Minnesota Vikings reach the NFC Championship Game in 2009 and Rodgers turned into one of the best quarterbacks of this generation.\n\nJones has a long way to go before being thought of at Rodgers' level, but the 22-year-old is off to a great start.", "description": "Pro Football Hall of Famer  Brett Favre  thinks  Eli Manning  would have been content to see Daniel Jones struggle in his first start with the  New York Giants .
