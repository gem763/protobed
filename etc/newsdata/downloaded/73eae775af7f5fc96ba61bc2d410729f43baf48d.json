Within days, the twinjet was grounded worldwide.\n\nThe Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee\u2019s final report into the first tragedy places primary blame for the loss of Lion Air 610 on the planemaker.\n\nThe Boeing 737 Max is the latest version of an aircraft more than half-a-century old. Because it has bigger engines mounted further forward than before, the plane\u2019s aerodynamic properties are affected.\n\nAnti-stall software known as Mcas (Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System) was installed, says Boeing, \u201cto enhance the pitch stability of the aeroplane \u2013 so that it feels and flies like other 737s\u201d.\n\nMcas was designed to intervene, by tilting the nose of the aircraft down, when a potentially dangerous \u201cangle of attack\u201d between the airflow and the wing was detected.\n\nBut the system had fundamental flaws. It could be triggered by a single faulty sensor. The nose-down force applied when the aircraft was travelling at high speed could not be overcome by the pilots. And it activated repeatedly.\n\nThe report says: \u201cA fail-safe design concept and redundant system should have been necessary for the Mcas.\u201d It adds that Boeing \u201cdid not adequately consider the likelihood of loss of control of the aircraft\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe absence of information about the Mcas in the aircraft manuals and pilot training made it difficult for the flight crew to diagnose problems and apply the corrective procedures,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe Indonesian report also criticises Lion Air\u2019s maintenance team. The Boeing 737 Max was fitted with a faulty angle-of-attack (AOA) secondhand instrument bought from a supplier in Florida, which was not properly tested before being installed.\n\nIt malfunctioned the day before the accident, when a third pilot travelling as a passenger on the flight deck helped resolve the problem. But despite that near-disaster, the 737 was kept in service and assigned to flight 610 the following morning.\n\nMcas activated shortly after take-off from the Indonesian capital, causing mounting confusion on the flight deck. The captain initially managed to keep the plane flying. But when he handed over control to the first officer in a bid to resolve the problem, his colleague lost control and the plane crashed.\n\nLast week it was revealed that a senior Boeing pilot had told a colleague three years ago that the anti-stall system was \u201crunning rampant\u201d in a flight simulator during tests.\n\nIn response, Boeing\u2019s president and chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said: \u201cWe commend Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee for its extensive efforts to determine the facts of this accident, the contributing factors to its cause and recommendations aimed toward our common goal that this never happens again.\n\n\u201cWe are addressing the [committee\u2019s] safety recommendations, and taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again.\u201d\n\nThe firm has updated the Mcas software \u201cto provide additional layers of protection if the AOA sensors provide erroneous data\u201d. It has also reduced the force applied by Mcas.\n\nThe company said: \u201cThe pilots will continue to always have the ability to override Mcas and manually control the aeroplane.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Boeing is updating crew manuals and pilot training, \u201cdesigned to ensure every pilot has all of the information they need to fly the 737 Max safely\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nHow to get the best Black Friday deals at Argos, John Lewis and Currys\n\nBoeing predicts 737 Max will fly again by the end of 2019\n\nBoeing replaces senior executive in charge of 737 Max\n\nBoeing pilots feared for 737 Max safety three years ago\n\nCaptain Sully outraged at fatal 737 MAX crashes being blamed on pilots\n\nTui Airways may change name of Boeing 737 Max before jet flies again\n\nBoeing 737 Max: \u2018Pilots led their passengers over an aerodynamic edge\u2019", "description": "Boeing started the sequence of events that led to the first 737 Max crash by installing an anti-stall system without telling pilots about its existence, purpose and pitfalls \u2013 that is the conclusion of investigators into Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air crash almost a year ago.All 189 passengers and crew died when", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v0wP_YQRj8yi_dk3stzCng--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/bb690b1827612306fe6477e781163537", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
