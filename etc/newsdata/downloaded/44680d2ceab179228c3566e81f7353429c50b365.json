Has that undercut U.S. credibility?\"\n\n\"The whole predicate of your question is insane,\" Pompeo responded.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The word of the United States is much more respected today than it was just two and a half years ago,\" the top U.S. diplomat added. \"The previous administration in Syria, where you asked the question earlier, the previous administration said, \u2018Boy, if you use chemical weapons that\u2019s going to be bad,\u2019 and the president drew a red line, President Obama drew a red line. He then duly ignored it.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has faced bipartisan criticism over its recent decision to move the troops, which was immediately followed by a Turkish military offensive against Kurdish fighters in the region.
