The longer this approach to vetting is left in place, the less independent the ACMD will be.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Professor Stevens\u2019 resignation in light of the minister\u2019s decision to block my appointment to the ACMD and general concerns around the politicised nature of the appointment process is well founded.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the government are undertaking checks on a person\u2019s social media account in relation to Brexit and Windrush, which have nothing to do with the work of the ACMD, is frankly Orwellian.\u201d\n\nMs Eastwood said she stands by her description of Ms Atkins\u2019 letter as \u201cutter BS\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the years the government ignore the evidence of the ACMD, which frankly is frustrating to all of us, not least because of drug related deaths and the continued decision to block drug consumption rooms, which could really save lives,\" she said.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the rates of drug-related deaths in this country, the highest since records began for the seventh year in a row. At some point you get frustrated at the lack of leadership from the Home Office on this issue.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, the government\u2019s chief drugs adviser Professor David Nutt was sacked by home secretary Alan Johnson after he criticised policy, saying ecstasy and LSD were less harmful than alcohol and cigarettes.\n\nFive other members of the panel resigned in the wake of the row.\n\nThe sacking forced ministers to reaffirm publicly their commitment to the independence of advisers and a working protocol was put in place to protect the body from governmental interference.\n\nMr Stevens' statement said the renewed commitment to the ACMD's independence following the debacle was a key factor in his decision to apply to the panel in 2014.\n\nResponding to Mr Stevens' departure, Prof Nutt said: \"The news that a leading expert on drug policy has resigned because the Home Office rejected another well-qualified expert for political reasons shows they have learnt nothing in the decade since my sacking. Surely it's now time to put the responsibility for drug policy in the Department of Health who at least understand the meaning of evidence.\"\n\nA government spokesperson: \u201cMinisters are responsible for appointing members to the boards of public bodies and do so in line with the Governance Code for Public Appointments. The names of candidates are submitted to Ministers following assessment by an independent Advisory Assessment Panel. It is then for Ministers to determine merit and make the final appointment.\n\n\u201cIt is important that candidates who are considered for these roles undergo appropriate checks to ensure they are suitable to hold these vital public positions\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "A drug policy expert on the government\u2019s advisory panel has resigned, warning the Home Office\u2019s \u201cpolitical vetting\u201d of applicants is undermining the body\u2019s independence.
