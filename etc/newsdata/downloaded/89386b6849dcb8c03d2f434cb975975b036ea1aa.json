The following day, a man posing as a state lawyer convinced him to hand over $500 to obtain a humanitarian visa with which, Jerez was told, he\u2019d be able to safely continue his passage north.\n\nMigrants brave the 'Beast' as Mexico cracks down under US pressure Read more\n\nJerez was travelling with several other Cubans, and together they also forked out $2,000 for an amparo \u2013 a legal petition used to temporarily suspend deportation if detained by immigration agents.\n\n\u201cWe arrived blind,\u201d Jerez told the Guardian, \u201ctrusted in what people said, but everyone took advantage of us.\u201d\n\nArmed with the visa and amparo, Jerez boarded a bus heading north hoping to reach the US border within the week, but didn\u2019t get far.\n\nJerez was detained at the first checkpoint leaving Tenosique after immigration agents who boarded the bus said the visa was fraudulent, and taken to the overcrowded National Migration Institute (INM) detention centre.\n\nHere, according to Jerez, he was threatened with prosecution \u2013 and eight years in jail \u2013 for false documents if he dared apply for asylum, rather than agreeing to deportation. The amparo was proclaimed useless.\n\nFor Jerez, going back to Havana wasn\u2019t an option: \u201cI just want to continue on my journey to the US. But I\u2019m scared of being deported, so even if it takes months, seeking asylum in Mexico seems like my only option to reach the border.\u201d\n\nJerez is among a rapidly growing number of Cubans turning to the Mexican asylum system amid a clampdown on alternative legal routes.\n\nIn the first seven months of this year, 4,604 Cubans applied for asylum in Mexico, representing 10% of all applicants. In 2018, 218 Cubans sought asylum, representing 1% of total applicants.\n\nHistorically, US-bound Cubans encountered far fewer obstacles on the migration passage due to unique legal protections and economic and educational advantages compared with Central Americans.\n\nBut, a crackdown by the US and Mexican governments has left tens of thousands of Cubans trapped in Mexico, facing the same dangers and hurdles as migrants from elsewhere. In April, Cubans spearheaded a mass escape from one overflowing detention centre in protest at delays and inhumane conditions.\n\nThe Cubans\u2019 plights can be traced back to Barack Obama\u2019s second term, when reducing migration was a key issue in bilateral discussions that eventually led to the historic diplomatic thaw between the old foes.\n\nMexico was instrumental in implementing this deal to curtail Cuban migration, according to Rodolfo Casillas, a migration scholar at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences (Flacso): Mexico detained 14,000 Cubans during 2015 and 2016 as rumours about a change in US policy prompted a surge in Cubans leaving the island.\n\n'They threw us into the street': Cubans tell of struggles to enter US Read more\n\nIn 2017, just days before leaving the White House, Obama revoked the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy which treated all Cubans arriving on US soil as political refugees, authorized to stay and legalize their status. Since then, Cubans have been obliged to enter the backlogged and time-consuming US asylum process like everyone else.\n\nNow, the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s policy is hitting Cubans in Mexico: in the north, thousands are waiting in line in border cities like Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to present their asylum cases at ports of entry.\n\nEn route, 5,512 Cubans were detained in the first six months of this year, compared with 504 during the whole of 2018. (710 have been deported this year, compared with 156 in 2018.)\n\nIn the south, in cities like Tenosique and Tapachula, those without the means to pay people smugglers are trapped since the exit pass \u2013 which allowed select nationals including Cubans and Haitians to traverse Mexico legally \u2013 was revoked in early 2019 amid the threat of crippling trade tariffs by Trump.\n\n\u201cThe tap has been turned off,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n M\u00e1rquez, director of the La72 migrant shelter, where 228 Cubans sought refugee in the first seven months of 2019, compared with 23 in 2019.\n\n\u201cMexico\u2019s only policy objective is to avoid conflict with Trump,\u201d said Casillas from Flacso. \u201cThis means stopping the flow of migrants, whatever it takes, which is fuelling people smuggling and asylum cases.\u201d\n\nIn Tenosique, most Cubans can be found renting cramped, very basic digs, looking for a safe route out of the boiling hot city where violent crimes against migrants have long been tolerated by authorities.\n\nYilesy Gonz\u00e1lez, 40, from the city of C\u00e1rdenas, sold the family home and left Cuba with her husband in mid-July, leaving behind their two children with her mother. Gonz\u00e1lez says that life had become intolerable since 2017, when authorities discovered the makeshift boat they\u2019d built to sail across the Caribbean Sea to Honduras.\n\nThe couple share an airless rented room with six others on the outskirts of the city, who are all waiting for appointments with the Mexican refugee agency. They don\u2019t have family in the US to help pay for a coyote (guide). \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to stay in Mexico, but not here, somewhere with jobs, so we could make a life.\u201d\n\nJosep Herreros, a UN refugee agency protection officer in Mexico, said: \u201cThe dramatic increase in Cubans seeking asylum reflects changes in migration policies in Mexico, rather than changes in their home country.\n\n\u201cThere must be safe legal paths to migration, so that asylum is only used by those who need international protection.\u201d", "description": "US-bound Cubans used to encounter far fewer obstacles on the migration passage, but that\u2019s changed due to crackdowns", "authors": ["Nina Lakhani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1eacf32dfbe2dbf598c649f5cf17d81f7865b99/0_223_4004_2404/master/4004.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=495fa1a3b3b5b53493eb9ca702b25da4"}
