A federal jury deliberated just over an hour Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019, before delivering guilty verdicts against Council. Council's trial in Florence, S.C., then moved into deciding whether he gets life in prison or the death penalty for shooting the manager and a teller at CresCom Bank in Conway in August 2017. (Florence County Detention Center via AP)\n\nFLORENCE, S.C. (AP) \u2014 A man who killed two South Carolina bank employees while taking $15,000 during a robbery was sentenced to die Thursday by a federal jury.\n\nThe same jurors found Brandon Council guilty last month of armed bank robbery resulting in death, among other charges for killing the manager and a teller at CresCom Bank in Conway in August 2017.\n\nThe jury\u2019s other option was life in prison without parole. They deliberated less than six hours over two days, news outlets reported.\n\nProsecutors pushed for the death penalty, saying Council deserved to die because he chose to murder everyone in the bank while seeking easy money, pulling a gun out instead of the robbery note he had in his pocket.\n\n\u201cHe did not have to kill anyone,\u201d prosecutor Nathan Williams said. \u201cHe killed everyone.\u201d\n\nCouncil\u2019s lawyers detailed his troubled childhood, raised by his grandmother who died just as he became a teenager. They also emphasized Council\u2019s remorse for his crime and how he cooperated with investigators after his arrest at a motel near his Wilson, North Carolina, home several days after the fatal robbery.\n\nThey reminded the jury Council would never leave prison whether he was executed or served out his life sentence.\n\n\u201cDoes he die from lethal injection?\u201d defense lawyer Duane Bryant said. \u201cOr does he die when someone calls for him?\u201d\n\nThe jurors were presented evidence over two weeks, including surveillance video of Council walking into the bank on Aug. 21, 2017 \u2014 the same day a full solar eclipse was seen in other parts of South Carolina and elsewhere.\n\nCouncil stood by teller Donna Major for nearly a minute before pulling out a gun and shooting her first in the arm and then in the chest as the stunned teller held papers in front of her face trying to protect herself.\n\nManager Katie Skeen ran into her office and hid under her desk. Council shot her in the forehead, according to the video and testimony.\n\nCouncil took $15,000 from the bank, including special bills that trigger a call to police if removed, authorities said. He then went back into Skeen's office and took the keys to her SUV to escape.\n\nCouncil was arrested several days later at a Greenville, North Carolina, motel. He had bought a used Mercedes with the robbery money, according to his confession.\n\nCouncil asked investigators if the women were still alive and cried when he found out they were dead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a doofus. I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Council told police. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d", "description": "A man who killed two South Carolina bank employees while taking $15,000 during a robbery was sentenced to die Thursday by a federal jury.
