That the record was set last season shows this is a problem Bruce has inherited, but he has done little to improve their offensive fortunes.\n\nTwo centre-halves combined to give them the lead here and such freakish moments are proving Newcastle's best bet right now, for those ordinarily charged with scoring goals are barely bothering to shoot, let alone score.\n\nWolves improved in the second half but couldn't take advantage of Newcastle's sending off\n\nJonny's crucial second half goal helped secure a point for Wolves after a sluggish first half\n\nJonny scored Wolves' equaliser following a mistake by Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka\n\nJamaal Lascelles rose high above the Wolves defence to head home Newcastle's first half goal\n\nNewcastle could have gone three points clear of the relegation zone with a victory\n\nLascelles has scored six Premier League goals in his career - all of which have been headers\n\nMATCH FACTS AND LEAGUE TABLE NEWCASTLE (3-4-2-1): Dubravka 4.5; Fernandez 6.5, Lascelles 7, Clark 6; Yedlin 5.5, M Longstaff 7 (Atsu 90), S Longstaff 6, Willems 5; Almiron 6, Saint-Maximin 7 (Gayle 90); Joelinton 5 (Shelvey 84) Subs not used: Darlow, Dummett, Muto, Krafth Goalscorers: Lascelles 37 Sent off: S Longstaff Booked: Clark WOLVES (3-4-2-1): Patricio 6; Doherty 7, Coady 6.5, Saiss 6; Traore 7.5, Dendoncker 6, Neves 6, Moutinho 6, Jonny 7; Jimenez 6, Jota 6 (Neto 70, 5) Subs not used: Ruddy, Vallejo, Cutrone, Vinagre, Kilman, Ashley-Seal Goalscorers: Jonny 73 Booked: Saiss Man of the Match: Traore Referee: K Friend 7 Attendance: 46,019 Season at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time has surely arrived to take \u00a340million club-record signing Joelinton out of the team - in fact, it did a few weeks ago - but with no fit replacement the one-goal striker carries on, let down by a lack of service but doing nothing to help himself either.\n\nFrom the black and white barcodes to the binary codes, Newcastle have scored either 0 or 1 in every game this season. A 1-0 scoreline is their only hope of victory and the players know it, at least judging by their second-half retreat after captain Jamaal Lascelles headed them in front from Federico Fernandez's delightful centre on 37 minutes.\n\nBruce appeared to suggest his team had taken it upon themselves to abandon any plans to further their advantage.\n\n'The second half was very difficult to say the least,' he said. 'I think we just decided that we'd just defend and try to protect what we had, but we didn't take care of the ball well enough.\n\n'Is it a mentality thing? Possibly. But we have to try to change that mentality. We spoke about it at half-time, to win the second half. We just sat in, and sat in, and looked to protect what we had.\n\nSean Longstaff had a good game until he was sent off following a high challenge\n\n'In the Premier League that's always difficult, you've got to try to pose a threat yourself, like we did in the first half. In the second half, we just didn't do enough.'\n\nWolves' leveller was inevitable - they were unrecognisable after the interval following a lethargic first half - and the only surprise was that it did not arrive until the 73rd minute.\n\nAdama Traore was brilliant after half-time, suddenly remembering that when he runs at players at speed he is pretty much unstoppable - just ask Newcastle's Jetro Willems.\n\nThe winger provided the pass from which Matt Doherty crossed and, when Dubrabka flapped at it - Bruce was right in his description - Jonny volleyed in from eight yards.\n\n'He knows he could have done better,' said Bruce. 'It's a poor decision from Martin. If you're going to come and flap at it, then the one thing you can't do is just push it in the middle of the goal.\n\n'That's a bit of a frustration. For all their work, it's a mistake that has got them their goal.'\n\nMiguel Almiron again failed to score as his wait for a first Premier League goal continues on\n\nDubravka signed a new six-year contract this week and spoke of taking the club into Europe. The only chance of continental adventure on recent evidence would be a mid-season training camp.\n\nNewcastle are one point above the relegation zone and were that to remain the case come May then it would be a cause for celebration. Bruce, though, says that is nothing new.\n\n'For the last couple of years, I don't think it's been any different has it, since the club came out of the Championship?' he asked.\n\n'And probably the couple of years before that too. Our aim is to go higher, of course, but I was under no illusion that it was going to be difficult..'\n\nDoherty came within inches of winning it in stoppage-time when he flashed a header wide from a Raul Jimenez cross.\n\nSteve Bruce's side failed to take up their chance to go three points clear of the relegation zone\n\nNuno Espirito Santo's side have now failed to win in their last three Premier League outings\n\nNewcastle were clinging on after Sean Longstaff's straight red card following a challenge on Ruben Neves eight minutes from time. The midfielder was unfortunate - there was no malice - but his follow-through caught Neves on the shin with his studs.\n\n'I think it's harsh,' said Bruce. 'The behaviour of Neves is another thing. When they're rolling around like that, you know they're not hurt, because when you're hurt, you stay motionless.\n\n'He's not in control of his foot, but then again, how is he supposed to be when he's just played the ball? In that respect, I think it's harsh on the boy, I really do.'", "description": "CRAIG HOPE AT ST JAMES' PARK: Martin Dubravka was Newcastle's fall guy - especially after Steve Bruce said his goalkeeper's 'flap' was the cause of Wolves' equaliser.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/16/20248788-0-image-a-32_1572193141904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
