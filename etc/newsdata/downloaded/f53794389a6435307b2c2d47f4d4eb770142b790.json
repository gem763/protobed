U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said sanctions would be removed after the deal is implemented and no further sanctions would be pursued.\n\nThe lira stood at 5.7805 against the dollar at 1238 GMT, firming some 0.75% from Thursday's close of 5.8250. It firmed to 5.7580 earlier.\n\nIt had weakened to 5.9395 this week in anticipation of the sanctions, which turned out to be softer than expected.\n\nJason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said while further sanctions were off the table for the moment, things could still go wrong with implementation of the ceasefire.\n\n\"After the five days, there could be an escalation of conflict in northern Syria,\" he said, adding that this could lead to another strain with Washington and bring sanctions back into play.\n\nU.S. prosecutors this week charged Turkey's Halkbank (IS: ) with evading sanctions on Iran, a move which Turkey said was also related to its operation in Syria. Pence said he told Turkish officials that the case was a matter for the New York court that charged the bank.\n\nHalkbank shares, which had plummeted following the news earlier this week, surged at Friday's opening, rising some 7.16%. They were up 6.21% at 1221 GMT.\n\nThe main BIST100 share index ( ) was up 3.82%, while the banking index ( ) was up 5.93%.\n\nDespite the ceasefire agreement, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen will move \"full steam ahead\" with plans to impose stiff sanctions on Turkey.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House of Representatives would vote on a bipartisan sanctions package against Turkey next week.\n\nTrump may try to veto or delay implementation of those sanctions, despite strong bipartisan support, Tuvey said, adding: \"He seems to be taking a fairly soft line on sanctions against Turkey.\"\n\nRATE CUT AHEAD?\n\nAfter the agreement between the allies eased pressure on the lira, expectations the central bank will cut interest rates at next week's meeting have risen again.\n\nQNB Finansbank chief economist Erkin Isik said the recent volatility in the lira had lowered rate cut expectations.\n\n\"Considering the agreement reached about Syria and the appreciation of the lira, we expect a 100 basis point cut from the monetary policy committee next week,\" he said, citing improvements in inflation.\n\nThe central bank has already cut its policy rate by 750 basis points this year, after hiking it to 24% last year to halt a currency crisis. Governor Murat Uysal has said the rate cuts were front-loaded.\n\nInflation, which hit a 15-year high of more than 25% in October last year, declined to below 10% last month.\n\nAta Invest Director Cem Tozge said the bank could cut borrowing costs by between 100 and 200 basis points.\n\n\"When we look at both the swap pricings and the lira LIBOR pricings, we see that a 200 basis point cut in the next three months, starting with 100 basis points next week, is being priced in,\" he said.\n\nTurkey's five-year credit default swaps, a gauge of the cost of insuring exposure to its sovereign debt, fell to 371 basis points on Friday, down from 385 basis points at Thursday's close, according to IHS Markit data.\n\nLonger-dated government bonds chalked up gains, with the 2030 issue jumping 1.6 cents to 135.186 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb.\n\nDollar-denominated bonds issued by Turkey's second-largest bank Halkbank also gained, with the 2021 issue adding as much as 2.7 cents to 89.95 cents in the dollar.", "description": "Turkish lira firms nearly 1% against dollar after Turkey-U.S. deal on Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9H1DD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
