But it is the working class in places like Beaver County who may ultimately decide Trump\u2019s fate.\n\nNone of the dozen or so union workers interviewed at a protest late last week had Twitter accounts. None had four-year college degrees. And few were committed to voting Democrat in 2020, although most were registered as such.\n\nDaniel Keener, a 72-year-old Democrat who retired after more than two decades at the nearby power plant, said his party has moved \u201cway too far left.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery one of them wants to take my gun,\u201d said Keener, motioning to the handgun clipped to his left pocket. He said he\u2019s committed to Trump in 2020, but he\u2019ll likely maintain his Democratic registration because he\u2019s \u201ca union man\u201d and his family has a long history with the party.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
