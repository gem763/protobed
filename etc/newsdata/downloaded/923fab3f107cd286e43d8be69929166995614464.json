Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Tom Cotton (R-AR), the lawmakers asked the acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire if the app maker could be compelled to turn Americans\u2019 data over to the Chinese authorities.\n\nTikTok has some 110 million downloads to date and has spiked in popularity for its ability to record short, snappy videos that are sharable across social media networks. But the lawmakers say because TikTok is owned by a Beijing-based company, it could be compelled by the Chinese government to turn over user data \u2014 such as location data, cookies, metadata and more \u2014 even if it\u2019s stored on servers it owns in the United States.\n\nBoth Schumer and Cotton warn that TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, is \u201cstill required to adhere\u201d to Chinese law.\n\n\u201cSecurity experts have voiced concerns that China\u2019s vague patchwork of intelligence, national security, and cybersecurity laws compel Chinese companies to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d the letter, dated Wednesday, said. \u201cWithout an independent judiciary to review requests made by the Chinese government for data or other actions, there is no legal mechanism for Chinese companies to appeal if they disagree with a request.\u201d\n\nThat same legal principle works both ways. U.S. companies have been shut out, or had their access limited, in some nation states \u2014 including China \u2014 over fears that they could be compelled to spy on behalf of the U.S. government.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Edward Snowden disclosures, which revealed the U.S. government\u2019s vast surveillance operation, several major tech companies were all dropped from China\u2019s approved state purchases list amid fear of U.S. cooperation in surveillance.\n\nThe senators also said they are concerned that the app was censoring content \u201cdeemed politically sensitive\u201d to Beijing. In September, The Guardian revealed that the app\u2019s moderators actively censor content relating to Tibetan independence, the Tiananmen Square massacre and the banned religious group Falun Gong.\n\nThey also said the app could pose a \u201ccounterintelligence\u201d threat as it could be used as a foreign influence tool as seen in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nWhen reached, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence would not comment.\n\nTikTok said it was \u201ccarefully reviewing\u201d the letter.\n\n\u201cWe will not be offering any further comment on it at this time other than to reaffirm that TikTok is committed to being a trusted and responsible corporate citizen in the U.S., which includes working with Congress and all relevant regulatory agencies,\u201d said TikTok spokesperson Josh Gartner.", "description": "Two lawmakers have asked the government\u2019s most senior U.S. intelligence official to assess if video-sharing app TikTok could pose \u201cnational security risks\u201d to the United States.
