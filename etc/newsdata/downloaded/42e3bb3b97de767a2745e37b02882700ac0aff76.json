The Chinese request for calm did the trick. The yield-curve and Treasury yields are priced for US recession. The S&P industrial sector is lagging SP500 badly. But there is election in 2020, and since 1968, only 2 election years [out of 9 total] had recessions in election years that cost Carter and [elder] Bush presidency. So, is it going to be Trump-trade-war and Trump-recession? [Unanswered, but the implication is that the WH strategy may shift soon]. Stocks have yielded more than 10-yr since August 5 but be cautious at these valuation levels.\n\nCorporate managements and investors love buybacks but politicians hate them. Buybacks can offset share issuance for stock and option grants, grow EPS, and may be better than unwise capex and M&A. Politicians mistakenly think that the buyback money could be spent for capex, new factories, more jobs, whether justified or not. Anyway, buybacks vary widely by sectors and pharma and consumer-staples [PG, MDLZ, LLY] have been quite aggressive in buybacks by increasing debt [that has been cheap but can bite in the next downturn]. There is less buyback risk in cash-rich old-tech [AAPL, MSFT].\n\nRetail has winners and losers. Winners are those offering value and convenience [in-store or online] such as WMT, TGT, DG, DLTR, FIVE, BURL, etc. Those have also adjusted for their China exposure. Losers are old line retailers such as BBY [60% of goods from China], TIF [HK issues], ULTA [bad bullish call by Barron\u2019s last week in view of shocking results], etc\n\n[The CME FedWatch tool, based on current fed fund futures quotes, shows the following probabilities for 2019:\n\nFor 2nd hike [cut], 0% for hike [96.9% for cut] at FOMC 9/18/19;\n\nFor 3rd hike [cut],\n\n0% for hike [55.9% for cut] at FOMC 10/30/19;\n\n0% for hike [78.6% for cut] at FOMC 12/11/19;\n\nhttp://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html ]\n\nFor the week [index changes only], DJIA +3.02%, SP500 +2.79%, Nasdaq Comp +2.72%, Russell 2000 +2.42%. DJ Transports +3.98%; DJ Utilities +1.62%. US$ +1.21%, oil/WTI +1.72%, gold -0.49%.\n\nYTD [index changes only], DJIA +13.19%, SP500 +16.74%, Nasdaq Comp +20.01%.\n\nPg M6, Europe: UK Cineworld [CINE.uk/CNNWF; fwd P/E 8.4] is attractive. It bought US Regal Entertainment Group in 2018. In July, it launched monthly movie subscription service Regal Unlimited .\n\nPg M6, Emerging Markets: Brazil\u2019s pension reforms cleared the House on July 10, but Senate approval is pending. However, EWZ is down -15% since then. GDP growth will be only +0.8%; inflation +4%; central bank rate 6%. Good Brazilian companies are expensive [ABEV at fwd P/E 21; RADLY at fwd P/E 40]. While it has benefited from the US-China trade war for soybean exports to China, its other exports [iron-ore, oil] have fallen in price. Amazon rain forest fire is not a factor in Brazilian investments, but they may hurt President Bolsonaro.\n\nPg M9, Commodities: August was bad for commodities. The US-China trade war and fears of global slowdown hurt most commodities; August declines were iron-ore -27%, gasoline -16%, lean hogs -10%, corn -9%, ethanol -9%, oil -5%, copper -4%; gold and silver were exceptions.\n\nPg M7, Options: VIX calls are recommended to protect from sudden news-driven selloffs. Beware that VIX options are based on VIX futures, not on VIX index. Less adventurous may buy calls, or sell puts, on exchanges [CBOE, ICE, NDAQ].\n\n[SP500 VIX 18.98, SKEW 115.37] [10-Yr TYVIX 5.29][Yahoo Finance data]\n\nPg M26, M32: A good week in Europe [Greece +5.89%, Italy +3.81%, Denmark -0.27%] and an up week in Asia [India +2.10%, HK -2.32%]. The equity CEF index [data to Thursday] underperformed the DJIA and its discount was -6%.\n\nTreasury rates 3-mo yield 1.99%, 2-yr 1.50%, 5-yr 1.39%, 10-yr 1.50%, 30-yr 1.96% [Treasury data*]. Dollar rose, DXY 98.81, +1.2% [M35]. Gold rose to $1,528, +1.6% [notable deviation again from pg M3]; the gold-miners rose [M38]. [^XAU was at 98.98, +1.23% for the week]\n\n*Treasury Yield-Curve https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=y...\n\nTop FDIC insured savings deposit rates*: Money-market accounts 2.37%; 1-yr CDs 2.37%; 5-yr CDs 2.76% [M32].\n\n*For local rates https://www.depositaccounts.com/banks/rates-map/\n\nPg 16: Cover Story, \u201cNext Frontier in Treating Disease - Biotechnology\u201d.\n\nPg 5, Up & Down Wall Street: August was crazy due to 3Ts \u2013 tweets, trade, Treasuries. A lazy, diversified portfolio worked fine. Bonds outperformed stocks. A 60-40 portfolio was up +14.45% YTD and +5.53% for 12-mo. Now comes September, typically the worst month. Bond market is projecting 3 rate cuts by mid-2020 and some strategists are calling for zero US rates. But if there is no recession in the US [consumer spending, jobs, wages remain strong], the rates may reverse and rise instead [that is the risk].\n\nThis is getting crazy \u2013 bonds for capital gains, stocks for income. Much of the bond overvaluation via nil/negative rates [YTM] is in foreign sovereigns. But these exclude the US munis \u2013 their tax exemption is not of much value to institutions and foreign funds, and they are not very liquid. Some high-quality munis [TX, MN, etc] now yield more than the Treasuries of corresponding maturities \u2013 it should be reverse due to muni tax exemption. Muni CEFs provide higher yields due to leverage [PML, NAD/NEA, BTT, etc]. [Forsyth\u2019s CEF picks have been primarily based on discounts and may not be the best]\n\nPg 7, Streetwise: Some companies that broke up a while ago are getting back together \u2013 Humpty-Dumpty trend. Current T is in part a recreation of the old Ma Bell . Current XOM is a partial recreation of the old Standard Oil . CBS and VIAB have gotten that urge to merge again, so have MO and PM. These recreations are often going for scale in mature and declining businesses. Wall Street is happy to oblige \u2013 acquisition, consolidation, restructure, go-private, go-public, go-bankrupt \u2013 whatever, so long as the deal fees keep flowing. Of course, the management that was in place when company was broken up is not the same management doing the recreation, so nobody has to admit mistakes. And wait until Humpty-Dumpty falls off the wall again.\n\nMore later\u2026.\n\nYBB", "description": "[ Italics-bold within the brackets are my additions/elaborations ] [ New M* Discussions doesn\u2019t allow any colors for cut-and-paste from WORD ] MW - 20354", "authors": ["Contributor", "Explorer", "Follower"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
