Last week alone, dozens were killed when the Taliban flattened a hospital in an attack in the south, and a US drone strike hit a group harvesting pine nuts in the east. And looming over the poll is the future of controversial US efforts to negotiate a troop withdrawal with the Taliban, suspended after a tweet by President Donald Trump but not entirely dead.\n\nWhoever wins the presidential poll will be in charge of trying to extend any deal to cover Afghan security forces, and negotiate first a ceasefire and then some form of shared government that does not sign away all the gains in democracy and women\u2019s rights of the last two decades.\n\nThe insurgents have vowed to target the election, and there have already been attacks on a campaign rally and one of the vice-presidential candidates. The tempo of their assaults means many people have already decided to stay away from polling stations in fear for their lives.\n\n\u201cVoting when there is such a bad situation means you are crazy. And I am not crazy,\u201d said Qasim Walizada, a 29-year-old taxi driver from western Kabul. \u201cThe polling stations are not secure.\u201d\n\nThis year is effectively a repeat of the 2014 race, when results were so twisted by fraud, and heavily contested, that the US had to step in to broker a government of national unity. There are 18 candidates but only two men who have a real chance of victory: incumbent President Ashraf Ghani and his CEO Abdullah Abdullah, who have spent five years feuding bitterly under their banner of unity, and both believe they can now seize control of the government.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A poster of Ashraf Ghani; he is one of only two candidates who stand a realistic chance of victory.

Take it for granted,\u201d said one senior Afghan source. With the US far more disengaged, a repeat of that standoff risks pitching the country into full-blown political meltdown, potentially galvanising the Taliban and undermining the push for peace negotiations between Afghans.\n\n\u201cI think [a repeat of 2104 results] is likely and it would have really dire consequences for Afghanistan, especially since this election is intended to showcase the continuation of democratic processes and institutions in negotiations with the Taliban,\u201d said Ali Yawar Adili of the Afghanistan Analysts Network (AAN). \u201cPresident Ghani himself has said the election is a litmus test for the continuation of the republic.\u201d\n\nCampaign and government officials are trying to temper expectations on how many people will come to the polls, saying voter turnout will probably be closer to the 3.6 million ballots cast in last year\u2019s parliamentary vote than eight million counted in the last presidential election.\n\n\u201cNow registered voters are around nine million. I cannot set a level of what kind of turnout will give legitimacy to a future government, but we are hoping and doing our best, and expect at least more turnout than for parliamentary elections,\u201d said Waheed Omer, director general of the Office of Public and Strategic Affairs. \u201cPeople have the understanding they are standing on the crossroads of whether they want to go vote and get a legitimate government and a continuation of the republic.\u201d\n\nYet diplomatic sources say even that figure may be optimistic, given the level of disillusionment in urban areas \u2013 where turnout for the parliamentary vote was already muted last year \u2013 and the effect of Taliban threats everywhere.\n\nEven in secure areas, some voters are fed up with both Ghani and Abdullah after five years in which they have failed to stem violence, to prevent an economic downturn, or to tackle the corruption that is endemic across the country and at all levels of government.\n\n\u201cNone of the candidates is trustworthy,\u201d said Sabara Akhlaqi, a 38- year-old teacher from northern Balkh province. \u201cWhoever wins will just fill their pockets with money that belongs to the Afghan nation, and commit all kinds of crimes. And if we vote for them, we will share responsibility for what they do.\u201d\n\nIn swathes of the country, people will not have the choice to vote; they have been effectively disenfranchised already by the war. About a third of the 7,366 polling centres will be closed because security forces cannot protect them, although it is hard to trace the exact patterns of exclusion, because the government has not provided a map of areas where stations are closed.\n\nDeputy interior minister General Khoshal Sadat said that a huge security operation would see 70,000 police dedicated to protecting polling stations. And although registration is usually tied to voter residence, he said that those whose nearest centre was closed would be able to vote elsewhere. \u201cFor example in one of the districts in Badakhshan, in an ideal world you would have five polling stations in that area. For now, people have to walk for an hour to get to the district centre to vote in one polling station,\u201d Sadat said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t prohibit people from voting.\u201d\n\nBut anyone who votes has their finger marked with indelible ink, to prevent them casting multiple ballots. It would be hugely risky for people to return to Taliban-controlled or dominated areas branded with a mark of defiance that lasts days. In past elections, the Taliban have cut off the fingers of people who voted.\n\nEven if Afghans defy security concerns to turn out in large enough numbers to give any government a popular mandate, there are still serious concerns about the effect of fraud after years of elections marred by cheating on an industrial scale.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The funeral of a victim of the US drone strike last week.

They should be approved by the security agencies, and the number given to the IEC has been questioned by the IEC,\u201d said AAN\u2019s Adili. \u201cIf some of these stations open in areas that are insecure and are not accessible to observers, then there could be ballot-stuffing.\u201d\n\nMany of these problems have been compounded by the fact that for months the elections were an uncertain prospect, on the political calendar under the constitution but thrust into a strange kind of political limbo by turbocharged US peace talks with the Taliban. Due to wrap up by September \u2013 an unofficial deadline set by Trump \u2013 they were widely expected to pave the way for an interim government, with elections cancelled or delayed.\n\nFor some in Kabul that is exactly why it is vital people turn out for this vote, despite all its flaws. \u201cThis election is really important,\u201d said one Afghan civil society activist. \u201cBecause less than a month ago we were on the brink of having an emirate imposed on us.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri", "description": "There have been attacks on a campaign rally and a candidate: voters say they are afraid for their lives", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/650585f09b7de056e8b08d5ff3ed0e0bace8104b/0_242_5592_3356/master/5592.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6e0b30ad2a0c935529acd6e1d8edfa5b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
