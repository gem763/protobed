I don\u2019t think anyone could complain about that. The right decision was made,\u201d Gatland said.\n\n\u201cRugby is heat of the moment stuff and he made an error of judgement. When you have got a lot of testosterone involved in some pretty high intensity games, that will sometimes happen. He\u2019s made a poor decision.\u201d\n\nBrunel agreed that Vahaamahina deserved to be dismissed. \u201cThe red card I don\u2019t contest - when you see the images it\u2019s very clear. He did have contact with the face so we can\u2019t deny that,\u201d Brunel said. \u201cOf course it changed the game. When you\u2019re playing half the match with 14 men it\u2019s difficult.\u201d", "description": "French rugby officials have described as \u2018shocking\u2019 a photo of Jaco Peyper with Wales fans jokingly recreating the elbow that saw him send off S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e40d5969ec82b3592c9160608e94c219d91c3b69/19_49_2772_1663/master/2772.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b8ec595837ea7987127172d64f0b871d", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
