The shifts have spurred conversations about equity and given urgency to concerns over student achievement gaps that have not narrowed in nearly 20 years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIssues of addressing diversity and inclusiveness have become more prominent as the school system sees its demographics continue to change,\u201d said Mark J. Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University.\n\nFairfax County School Board races are nonpartisan, and candidates are listed on ballots as independent. But political parties in the left-leaning county wield significant influence even in school board elections, issuing endorsements that candidates use to persuade voters.\n\nRepublicans have set out to capture more seats and usher in a new majority. Democrats view the election as an opportunity to seize full control \u2014 all but two seats are held by candidates backed by the Democratic Party.\n\nAD\n\nSchool boundaries \u2014 a lightning rod in school systems throughout the nation and often a proxy for issues of class and race \u2014 have emerged at the heart of this year\u2019s election.\n\nAD\n\nCandidates endorsed by the Republican Party have asserted the school system wants to bus students out of their neighborhoods to balance schools by race and income. They have also decried the One Fairfax policy, a declaration approved by county and school officials that promotes racial and social equity, as overly vague.\n\nSchool board members and candidates endorsed by the Democratic Party flatly reject those claims. They say the Republican-endorsed candidates have manufactured issues about redistricting and created an uproar over One Fairfax to incite fear.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Republican-endorsed candidates are creating false narratives to scare voters,\u201d said Megan O. McLaughlin, an incumbent fighting to keep the Braddock District seat.\n\nCandidates \u2014 including those battling for three at-large seats \u2014 have broadly identified many of the same issues.\n\nAD\n\nThey want to reduce the number of classroom trailers and improve students\u2019 mental health. They care about closing the achievement gap and creating a safe environment for students \u2014 but disagree on how best to accomplish those goals.\n\nRepublican-endorsed candidates say the school board has become immersed in issues that have nothing to do with improving academic achievement, such as renaming J.E.B. Stuart High School \u2014 now known as Justice High \u2014 and updating the school system\u2019s sexual health curriculum to include lessons about gender identity and transgender issues.\n\nAD\n\nA Republican-endorsed candidate for an at-large seat, Vinson Xavier Palathingal, accuses the school board of \u201csocial engineering\u201d on his campaign website. He said money spent changing a school name would be put to better use addressing building needs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPast sins are unforgivable sins,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI understand that. But name-changing and doing this kind of stuff is not the solution for that. We have to move on.\u201d\n\nPriscilla M. DeStefano, another Republican endorsee running for an at-large seat, said the school board\u2019s focus on \u201csocial issues\u201d has taken time away from improving student performance and narrowing achievement gaps.\n\n\u201cWhere has the help been?\u201d DeStefano said. \u201cIf they\u2019ve had a supermajority, why haven\u2019t they fixed this problem?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOver the summer, the school board considered a proposal that would have revised the criteria the district uses to redraw school boundaries.\n\nThe school board has not approved the proposal and has instead chosen to hire a consultant to look at the district\u2019s boundary policies. But some Republican-backed candidates have continued to use the issue as campaign fodder.\n\nAD\n\nThe proposal would have directed school officials to consider the socioeconomic and racial composition of students once the district decides that a school boundary update is necessary. Factors that could drive a boundary update include the opening of a new school, overcrowding or the need for equal access to programs.\n\nAD\n\nIt would have also asked school officials to consider the location of schools, the safety of walking routes and busing costs.\n\nIn the weeks and months after the proposal was put forward, dismayed parents organized into a group called Voices of Fairfax. They launched a website and circulated a video asserting, \u201cNew boundaries will be based on race and income.\u201d Parents flooded a school board meeting in July, expressing fear and anger that students would be bused away from schools in their neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cVoices of Fairfax stopped them from a social engineering experiment with our children,\u201d said Fadi Shadid, a founding member of the organization.\n\nThe declarations prompted Fairfax Schools Superintendent Scott Brabrand to write a letter and appear in a video to \u201cclarify some misinformation that is unfortunately circulating in our community and in the media about school boundaries.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you hear friends or neighbors discussing this issue, please help us set the record straight,\u201d Brabrand said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be busing students out of their neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nThe superintendent\u2019s decision to issue the video sparked accusations from the Fairfax County Republican Committee that Brabrand engaged in electioneering on behalf of Democratic school board members and candidates, which Brabrand denies.\n\nCheryl A. Buford, who is running for an at-large seat and is backed by the Republican Party, said she feels the current school board disregards input from residents with dissenting opinions. She fears that One Fairfax has been used \u201cas a pretext for the current school board to use ideology\u201d in its decision-making and \u201cnot necessarily what\u2019s in the best interest of our students.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZia A. Tompkins, a Republican-endorsed candidate running for the Braddock seat, has made concerns about redistricting key to his campaign platform. On his Facebook campaign page, Tompkins flashes two thumbs up while wearing a shirt that says \u201cfight redistricting.\u201d\n\nHe said he believes the school board backed away from updating school boundary criteria because it became a \u201cpolitical liability\u201d and argued the board has abandoned core responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThey are so focused on red-meat issues for the Democratic base,\u201d Tompkins said.\n\nMcLaughlin, the incumbent who has been endorsed by the Democratic Party, said Tompkins has misrepresented the school board\u2019s intentions.\n\nShe said she is a staunch supporter of neighborhood schools and noted the school board has not moved forward with the proposal.\n\n\u201cI hope that voters will move past the fearmongering and the false narratives on the single issue that my opponent wants to focus on,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cWhile we both value neighborhood schools \u2026 I bring, in addition to that, a long-standing record of improving our public schools.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOther candidates said they feel the focus on school boundaries has distracted from other issues.\n\nRachna Sizemore Heizer, a candidate endorsed by the Democratic Party who has emphasized improving special education, said she feels the misinformation has shifted the conversation from topics such as improving students\u2019 mental health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been sad to me to watch the smoke and mirrors,\u201d the at-large candidate said. \u201cIt\u2019s using fear to get people to vote a certain way instead of having honest conversation.\u201d\n\nAnother Democrat running at large, Abrar E. Omeish, said the conversations over boundaries have become sensationalized and moved \u201cfar from fact.\u201d But she said the concerns illustrate a problem in the school system \u2014 if the district were equitable, she said, parents would not be so forceful about where they want to send their children to school.\n\n\u201cThis conversation has gotten so far from nuance,\u201d said Omeish, who does not think the current school board has done enough to improve equity.\n\nThe tone of the election has not gone unnoticed by voters. Jane Miscavage, president of the Fairfax County Council of PTAs, said she feels the \u201cnational tone has invaded our county.\u201d\n\nShe has been dismayed by \u201cscare tactics\u201d some candidates embraced to stoke fears about busing and said she has been attacked over social media and accused of training PTA presidents to promote busing. PTAs do not endorse candidates.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a year quite like this,\u201d she said. \u201cPTA is like apple pie. Why would you go after us?\u201d\n\nThese are the seats and candidates in the Fairfax County School Board race, with a \u201cD\u201d signifying that a candidate has been endorsed by the Democratic Party and an \u201cR\u201d the Republican Party:\n\nAt-large (three seats)\n\nCheryl A.
