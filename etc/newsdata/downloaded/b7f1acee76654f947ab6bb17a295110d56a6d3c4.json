In both ridings, the Liberal candidates narrowly won by a little over 300 votes and Bloc candidates came in second.\n\nAccording to Elections Canada results, Liberal candidate Soraya Martinez Ferrada earned 328 more votes than Bloc candidate Simon Marchand in the Montreal riding of Hochelaga.\n\nLiberal candidate Jean-Yves Duclos beat Bloc challenger Christiane Gagnon by 325 votes in the riding of Quebec.\n\nA source in the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois who was not authorized to speak publicly said there were discrepancies between the final result and the number of votes counted in the ballot boxes in both ridings.\n\nThe requests bring the total number of recounts sought to three; the NDP told Radio-Canada it has requested a recount in Port Moody-Coquitlam, where Conservative candidate Nelly Shin was elected by 153 votes over NDP challenger Bonita Zarrillo.\n\nIn court documents filed Monday in B.C. Supreme Court, the NDP alleges there were counting errors at multiple polling stations in Port Moody-Coquitlam.\n\nChallenging election results\n\nAccording to the Canada Elections Act, election results in a riding can be contested in several ways.\n\nAn automatic recount is triggered when the difference in the number of votes received by the top-finishing candidates equals 0.1 per cent or less of the total number of votes cast.\n\nA requested recount takes place when a candidate or voter asks for one within four days of the release of the validated results.\n\nTo get a requested recount, a party must file an affidavit before a judge arguing the formal vote count was carried out improperly, and pay a $250 deposit with the court. If the judge agrees to proceed, the recount must begin within four days of receiving the application.\n\nBoth automatic and requested recounts are called \"judicial\" recounts.\n\nCandidates and voters also can challenge the eligibility of any candidate \u2014 or cite any irregularities, fraud or corrupt or illegal practices that might have affected the result \u2014 through a contested election proceeding.\n\nRuling could come within days\n\nNatasha Gauthier, a spokesperson for Elections Canada, said the elections agency is aware of the requests and is sending lawyers to attend the court hearings.\n\nGauthier said rulings determining whether Elections Canada must proceed with recounts could come this week or next.\n\nDuclos, who is currently the minister of families, children and social development, said it is within the Bloc's rights to ask for a recount.\n\n\"Our democracy allows for a judicial recount to be requested,\" said Duclos' office in a statement. \"Out of respect for the ongoing judicial process, we won't comment any further on this matter.\"", "description": "The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the New Democratic Party have asked Elections Canada to conduct recounts in three ridings where the races were settled by only a few hundred votes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322392.1571318456!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jean-yves-duclos-christiane-gagnon-composite.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
