But the clash helped to define a night of brutal attacks, fast-paced policy mastication and enough weird unscripted moments \u2013 businessman Andrew Yang, the only non-professional politician onstage, announced a raffle on his web site \u2013 to raise the question of whether the third debate could shake up this race.\n\nAfter all, the contest had seemed to glide listlessly through the end of summer, with Biden easily on top in the polls, senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders somewhere behind him, and the rest of the field below. The preservation of that pecking order could now depend on how voters respond to Warren\u2019s magisterial replies to questions on topics from public education to healthcare \u2013 \u201cI know what\u2019s broken, I know how to fix it, and I\u2019m going to lead the fight to get it done,\u201d she said \u2013 versus Sanders\u2019 peppy defense of his territory as a pioneer in advocating universal healthcare reform: \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d he barked (again).\n\nAnd while Castro\u2019s attack on Biden might not have landed, the frontrunner repeatedly seemed to fumble the facts: he at one point mistakenly referred to Sanders as the president, he badly botched the name of the Moms Demand Action gun safety group and he said nonviolent offenders shouldn\u2019t be in prison when he (apparently, aides later said) meant nonviolent drug offenders.\n\nWhen he got in trouble, Biden got punchier, and sometimes wilder, with an answer on education confusingly swerving into the previous topic, Venezuela and foreign policy.\n\nCastro, the reliable foil, was right there with a smirk and a quip: \u201cThat\u2019s quite a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nBut for all the psychic concentration over the nearly three-hour debate on the three front-runners, some of the biggest moments of the night were delivered by candidates who, until now, have been waiting in the wings.\n\nIt was O\u2019Rourke who delivered a blistering attack on Donald Trump as a racist. \u201cWe have a white supremacist in the White House,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, in one of the night\u2019s biggest applause lines, \u201cand he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.\u201d\n\nBooker echoed the attack, but paired it with a call to action. \u201cWe know Donald Trump\u2019s a racist,\u201d Booker said, \u201cbut there is no Red Badge of courage for calling him that.\u201d\n\nIf the Democrats had seemed to take their rhetorical gloves off, there were still enough moments of alternating agreement and chaos to deliver on the night\u2019s promise (or threat) of an incoherent policy stew.\n\nKlobuchar contributed her own Trump joke \u2013 \u201cHouston we have a problem\u201d \u2013 and found a way to turn Sanders\u2019 health careline against him. \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd on page eight it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.\u201d\n\nBut, Castro aside, the cross-stage sniping was mostly gentle. After Yang announced his raffle \u2013 $1,000 a month for 10 lucky families \u2013 mayor Pete Buttigieg quipped, \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d\n\nBut if the top trio of Biden, Sanders, and Warren is to be derailed, the candidate who seems best positioned to do it \u2013 Senator Kamala Harris \u2013 decided to do it not by attacking Biden, as she memorably did in the first debate, but by attacking Trump.\n\nRepeatedly Harris went after Trump, including over the El Paso shooting of 3 August: \u201cObviously he didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition,\u201d she said.\n\nTypical of the scattered, uneven but memorably eventful debate evening, Harris also launched attacks on Trump that were more offbeat \u2013 and ultimately awkward.\n\n\u201cHe reminds me of that guy in the Wizard of Oz, you know when you pull back the curtain he\u2019s a really small dude?\u201d Harris told ABC News moderator George Stephanopoulos, who\u2019s not tall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even taking the bait,\u201d Stephanopoulos said.\n\n\u201cAw, George,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about you.\u201d\n\n", "description": "There were moments of clarity from Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker intermixed in the chaos and weirdness", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b02a5c876c70e34acd72fa5f2f1a36e70663cdc3/0_321_4907_2946/master/4907.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=451cce89bca7dd826190270b39721343", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
