Scroll down to find out why you need to hear them, too.\n\nWhat new Canadian tunes are you currently obsessed with? Share them with us on Twitter @CBCMusic.\n\n'Sweet Grass,' Jenn Grant\n\nThis song starts out spare and sparse, but about a quarter of the way in, Jenn Grant counts us in and kicks it up a notch. It's bracing and electric as the full band swoops in, and there's something super compelling about the pretty pounding of keys as the main driving force under Grant's always-sweet soprano. It's another presentation of fierceness, of resilience, and it reminds the listener that sometimes our understanding of strength is all wrong. Choosing to hold onto beauty, to retain some softness when the world is very hard, is its own power.\n\n\u2014 Andrea Warner\n\n'Lesbian Break-Up Song,' Safia Nolin feat. La Force\n\n\"These bodies are not here to be judged or desired. These bodies are here to simply exist,\" Safia Nolin says of the new music video for her duet with La Force, \"Lesbian Break-Up Song,\" in which she and a group of women exist, naked, in front of the camera in myriad ways that are never sexual. Nolin teamed up with Bien \u00e0 vous studio and the Womanhood Project for the video, which was entirely made by and starring a female-identifying crew.\n\nOften on the receiving end of online trolling and body-shaming, Nolin explains how she didn't like her body, and how the process of filming this video made her confront her fears. \"All of the womxn on set really emboldened me to be myself,\" she details. The video is a vulnerable celebration of all body types, so beautifully raw that you feel exposed merely watching it. The words Nolin wrote to go with her art are just as poignant: read them all via Bonsound.com .\n\n\u2014 Holly Gordon\n\n'Still Life,' Little Scream\n\nLittle Scream's upcoming album, Speed Queen, confronts class, poverty and politics, but when Laurel Sprengelmeyer needs to escape the heaviness of those topics, she looks to painting. \"I guess painting is my 'happy place,'\" she said in a statement . \"Still Life\" is one of the few points of levity that can be found on Speed Queen, with a sparkling low-key groove inspired by an \u00c9douard Manet's painting .\n\n\"I had just been discussing that Manet painting Un bar aux Folies Berg\u00e8re, and I finished writing the song with the unrequited longing that painting has always inspired in me,\" she continued in the statement. The song spins a \"sophisticated daydream\" where Sprengelmeyer tells her subject, \"I see you so clear but nothing moves,\" as her falsetto climbs higher and higher on its chorus. In these chaotic times, Sprengelmeyer has found a way to slow things down and zero in on a specific subject and feeling that brings her some peace and clarity \u2014 hopefully this track will have a similar effect on you.\n\n\u2014 Melody Lau\n\n'Signs,' Sorrey\n\nIt's a tricky thing, balancing the weight that signs should have on your life. Do you heed them? Are they nonsense? How much do horoscopes really matter? As with everything, you take from them what you will, and with Sorrey's latest track, the P.E.I. band is fully leaning into those life coincidences. \"For me, it's the story of meeting someone who fills in all the gaps,\" says Emilee Sorrey, the band's namesake. \"Where I fall short they're in abundance, and vice versa.\"\n\nOver sharply punctuated synths, Sorrey dreamily leads us through the ways in which meeting this someone has balanced the scales \u2014 though there's still some tension in the navigation. In the new (and mesmerizing) video for \"Signs,\" Sorrey and bandmates Colin Buchanan, Andrew Murray, Bruce Rooney and Luke Pound playfully face off with human-sized (Donnie Darko-esque?) rabbits, effectively brandishing flowers as weapons. A band after my own heart. \u2014 HG\n\n'Won't Be Late,' Swae Lee feat. Drake\n\nAmerican rapper Swae Lee has worked with many giants in the music industry as a vocalist and songwriter, including Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9 and more. Now, he's teamed up with Canadian superstar Drake to bring us the danceable single \"Won't Be Late.\" Produced and co-written by Nigerian Afrobeats artist Tekno, the song blends a steady, thumping beat with sparse keyboard. Throughout the track, Swae Lee and Drake ruminate on the value of taking it slow in a relationship, with Drake crooning that he's \"saving my time for you\" and \"closed off my line for you.\" It's the perfect pace for the end of summer.\n\n\u2014 Natasha Ramoutar\n\n'Clouds,' Maddee", "description": "Looking for new tunes?
