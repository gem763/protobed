And today is called \u2018Dhanteras\u2019 \u2013 it means the \u2018day of wealth\u2019. It means feeling a sense of abundance, and whatever is needed will come! Remember all the blessings you have received in life and feel grateful for it.\n\nThe tradition is to put all the wealth you have earned in front of you and feel the abundance. When you feel lack, the lack grows but when you put your attention on abundance, then abundance grows. In the Arthashastra, Chanakya says, \u2018Dharmasya Moolam Arthah\u2019 which means, \u2018prosperity is the root of righteousness\u2019.\n\nDiwali symbolises the victory of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. For an oil lamp to burn, the wick has to be partially immersed in the oil. If the wick is completely drowned in oil, it cannot bring light. Life is like the wick of the lamp, you have to be in the world and yet remain untouched by it. If you are drowned in the materialism of the world, you cannot bring joy and knowledge in your life. By being in the world, yet not drowning in the worldly aspect of it, we can be the light of joy and knowledge.\n\nDiwali is the commemoration of the light of wisdom in our lives. Lamps are lit on this day not just to decorate homes, but also to communicate this profound truth of life. Light the lamp of wisdom and love in every heart and bring a radiant smile on every face. Diwali is also called Deepavali, which literally means rows of lights. Life has many facets and stages to it and it is important that you throw light on each one of them, for life to be fully expressed. The rows of lights remind you that every aspect of life needs your attention and the light of knowledge.\n\nEvery human being has some good qualities. And every lamp that you light is symbolic of this. Some people have forbearance, some have love, strength and generosity, while others have the ability to unite people. The latent values in you are like a lamp. Don\u2019t be satisfied with lighting just one lamp; light a thousand! You need to light many lights to dispel the darkness of ignorance. By lighting the lamp of wisdom in yourself and acquiring knowledge, you awaken all facets of your being. When they are lit and awakened, it is Diwali.\n\nDiwali means to be in the present. So drop past regrets and future worries; just live in the moment. It is a time to forget the bickering and negativities that have happened through the year. It is a time when you throw light on the wisdom you have gained and welcome a new beginning. When true wisdom dawns, it gives rise to celebration.\n\nCelebration is the nature of spirit. Ancient sages brought sacredness in every celebration, so that you don\u2019t lose focus in the hustle-bustle of activity. Observing rituals and religious practices (puja) is simply showing one\u2019s gratitude to the Divine. This brings depth to the celebration.\n\nFor the one who does not have spiritual knowledge, Diwali comes only once a year, but for the wise, Dhanteras and Diwali is every moment and every day.\n\nFollow Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at speakingtree.in", "description": "By Sri Sri Ravi Shankar At this time of the year people around the world are getting ready to celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights, one of the biggest festivals of the East.
