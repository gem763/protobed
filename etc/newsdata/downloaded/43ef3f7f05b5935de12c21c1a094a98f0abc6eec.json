Suffolk officials said the investigation is ongoing.\n\nIn another recently-identified conversation, an inmate was recorded on a video call with a 16-year old girl who had been suspended from school, according to officials with the technology company. The student said she was going to return to the school to \u201ceven the score.\u201d\n\nWhen the video call was flagged and reviewed, investigators determined that while making the threat \u201cshe was holding a Glock [9 mm pistol] in her hand,\u201d said LEO Technologies CEO Scott Kernan, a former secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Kernan declined to identify the region where the incident took place, citing an ongoing investigation.\n\nIn Alabama, corrections officials said they caught an inmate teaching his wife how to smuggle Suboxone, which aids in opiate withdrawal, into the jail -- by dissolving the drug in water and then using a makeup brush to paint the drug onto the back of postcards that would be mailed to the jail. Another recently-uncovered alleged plot involved smuggling narcotics into a facility by secreting them inside the soles of orthopedic shoes being delivered to an inmate who had been authorized to wear them by a county doctor, according to LEO internal reports.\n\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nData-mining prison phone calls\n\nThe AI systems employed in these cases use speech-recognition technology, semantic analytics and machine learning software to build growing databases of searchable words \u2013 part of a global revolution in neural networks that can understand speech and build databases that just a few years ago were prohibitively difficult to search with AI in real time.\n\nLEO Technologies\u2019 system is powered by Amazon transcription technology, part of a suite of technology services the retail giant has been marketing to U.S. law enforcement in recent years -- including facial recognition software. Some critics -- including some of Amazon's own employees -- say Amazon is essentially expanding the government\u2019s surveillance capabilities for its own profit.\n\nIn February, Amazon acknowledged the criticism of its facial recognition software in a statement which offered \"proposed guidelines for the proper use of the technology.\"\n\n\"In the two-plus years we\u2019ve been offering Amazon Rekognition, we have not received a single report of misuse by law enforcement,\" the statement noted. .\n\nThe $1.2 billion prison phone call industry has also come under fire in recent years for charging exorbitant rates for calls, according to annual studies by the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit think tank \u2013 as well as for tracking the locations of individuals called by imprisoned inmates, before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that practice illegal. One of the nation\u2019s largest prison phone company has also spurred controversy by recording privileged attorney-client phone calls, sparking litigation that remains ongoing.\n\nBut the underlying suite of AI-driven technologies being marketed to U.S. prisons and jails, which rapidly mine existing inmate recorded call databases, is beginning to change the way prisons monitor their inmate populations. The \"smart prisons\" industry is still evolving. The nation's two largest phone service providers to prisons and jails -- GTL and Securus, its main rival, are building out their own call analytics technologies. Securus is developing biometric voice identification technology and GTL is marketing iPad-like tablets for inmates. LEO -- which contracts with GTL -- is currently operating in five U.S. states, company officials said.\n\nLEO Technologies embeds its own investigators into the corrections and law enforcement agencies it contracts with, and those investigators seed the databases with keywords, phrases and prison slang specific to the region of the country. They then notify law enforcement partners when the system picks up suspicious language or phrasings, a rapid-response process that company officials claim has prevented dozens of attempted suicides over the past two years in several states -- after officials were able to get an inmate psychological counseling in the minutes and hours after the inmate was recorded making references to self-harm. The same process is followed when recorded conversations point to imminent threats of violence within the facility, or to plots to smuggle in contraband.\n\nThe system's cost can vary, LEO Technologies officials said, but generally cost between $500,000 and $600,000 a year for a corrections facility housing about 1,000 inmates.\n\nUnmonitored inmate communication ranked third in the list of most pressing priorities in a National Institute of Justice study of the nation\u2019s nearly 7,000 correctional institutions published this year by the RAND Corporation, coming in behind only controlling prison contraband markets (No. 1) and inmate attacks on infrastructure security systems (No. 2).\n\nPrisons and jails \u201care looking at this very seriously, and several are using it -- trying to figure out the right balance and mix of human and technology,\u201d said Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriff\u2019s Association.\n\n\"Voice recognition has been around for 12 or 13 years,\" he said. \"The question is: what do you do with the data?\"\n\nThe technology has the potential to solve a decades-old challenge inside the nation\u2019s corrections facilities.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest operational issues that has plagued this industry of automated inmate telephone recording has been the lack of staffing to monitor every single call,\u201d said John Shaffer, a corrections technology expert and one of the authors of the NIJ study who spent 31 years working in Pennsylvania state and county prisons. \u201cAnd, frankly, most inmate calls are innocuous.\u201d\n\nRetired warden Robert Hood, who from 2002 to 2005 ran Colorado\u2019s ADX Florence \u201cSupermax\u201d federal facility, agreed.\n\n\u201cIn the three prisons where I was warden, it was pretty much reactive: a very small percentage [of inmate calls] was monitored and it was done after the fact, when there was a crime or an alleged crime, that you\u2019d get on to your phone monitoring equipment and try and hunt down what occurred,\u201d he said.\n\nShaffer said that U.S. prison wardens have tried a variety of ways to balance the regular, proactive monitoring of inmate calls with limited staff resources.\n\n\u201cThere [have] been different approaches over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember Walla Walla penitentiary out in the state of Washington used to have officers sitting there in the towers at night listening to inmate calls for hours and hours and hours -- and that was their solution. And it never really worked as an operational solution.\u201d\n\nChris Francescani/ABC News\n\nBriefed on the technology, Hood said he recognized its potential value for intelligence, as long as it was used in conjunction with, and did not supplant, traditional corrections practices like working with confidential informants, daily engagement with inmates, inspections, and drug-sniffing dog patrols.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s where my mind goes,\u201d Hood said. \u201cWould Whitey still be alive today if we had that intelligence?\u201d he wondered, referring to the vicious murder of the Boston organized crime boss and FBI informant James \"Whitey\" Bulger last fall, the day after he was transferred to the Hazelton federal penitentiary in West Virginia. Bulger was beaten with sock-wrapped padlocks and his eyes were nearly gouged out with a shiv, or makeshift knife.\n\n\u201cWould there be some talk back and forth about hitting Whitey when he went to West Virginia to the federal prison?\" Hood wondered. \"And would [pedophile financier Jeffrey] Epstein -- who committed suicide, allegedly -- would there have been any value in the artificial intelligence in those types of scenarios? I want to believe yes, there would be value. The system that we had didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nCracking codes\n\nInside prisons and jails, criminal conduct is conveyed in code, where words can have very different meanings in different places, and can change from month to month or year to year. An AK-47, commonly known in Alabama prison culture as a \u201cstick,\u201d is called a \u201ctube\u201d elsewhere, or a \u201cmower,\u201d or a \u201cchopper,\u201d according to corrections officials in two states.\n\n\"Synthetic marijuana -- which is sometimes called 'spice' -- they\u2019ve taken to calling it \u201cno show\u201d because if you smoke synthetic marijuana, it's not going to show up on the drug test,\" said David Thompson, a recently-retired commander in the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office, who is not related to Jonathan Thompson.\n\nMethamphetamine is known in the South as \u201cmylar\u201d or \u201cice,\u201d while it\u2019s commonly referred to in Los Angeles as \u201cglass,\u201d or \u201cwindow,\u201d officials said.\n\nA \u201cbinky\u201d is a homemade syringe for injecting drugs, often made out of an eyedropper, a pen shaft, and a guitar string, according to \"Prison Diaries,\" a popular blog about prison life authored by a former inmate, which originally appeared in the New Haven Independent newspaper.\n\nA year from now, all that slang could be obsolete \u2013 so investigators are constantly feeding new intelligence about prison slang into databases tailored to their unique jurisdiction or regional area.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taught the system how to speak inmate,\u201d said James Sexton, another executive at LEO Technologies.\n\nAt other times, the intentions an inmate conveys in a prison phone call are crystal clear.\n\nAfter a Birmingham, Alabama man was arrested in 2017 on outstanding felony warrants and his car was towed to a local impound yard, law enforcement officials said they were tipped by LEO\u2019s technology to search his car for drugs.\n\n\u201cHe calls family members and asks them to go to the tow yard, and get a locked camera case from his car,\u201d said David Thompson. \u201cAnd he gives them the three-digit code to unlock the case.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers alerted to the phone call got a search warrant and rushed to the impound yard with drug-sniffing dog.\n\n\u201cWe sent our narcotics people to the tow yard and beat the family there,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even have to break the case open because we had the code.\u201d\n\nInside the camera case, authorities found three grams of cocaine, two grams of heroin and an undetermined amount of the sedative alprazolam, Thompson said.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn another recent incident in Jefferson County, authorities said they caught an inmate running a prostitution ring from inside the prison.\n\n\u201cHe was complaining [on a prison phone] to the handler that a human trafficking victim was too far away for him to control her,\u201d David Thompson said. \u201cHe was complaining that she was in California. He wanted her brought back closer to [Alabama],\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWhen we showed up at the hotel in Birmingham where the inmate had sent the trafficking victim, we were able to intercept them at the hotel and charge the handler.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was running this prostitution ring and he had never left the building,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nThwarting suicides and sharing intelligence\n\nThe new technology is also thwarting planned or attempted suicides, corrections officials in three states said.\n\n\"You always have reservations when you\u2019re talking about new technology,\u201d said Oxford, Alabama police chief Bill Partridge. \u201cBut it made a believer out of me in the first week. We\u2019ve solved homicides, arsons, stopped jail contraband, solved some cold cases. But to me, though, the suicide prevention is the most valuable tool.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just tragic all around when someone wants to take their life,\" Partridge said. \"But taking your life in a penal institution -- that\u2019s a huge news story, because we\u2019re there to maintain their health and well-being. It [the AI technology] saves taxpayers copious amounts of money and it also helps the family because they don\u2019t have to deal with that situation.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u201d It\u2019s a constant game of cat and mouse \u2013 as we figure out an intervention, inmates figure out a circumvention.\n\nTraditionally, U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have resisted sharing information in order to protect their investigations. From small town detectives all the way up to the rivalry exposed after the 9/11 attacks between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), investigators are notorious for aggressively protecting information they develop.\n\nBut the new A.I. technologies may be starting to change all that.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s a crime on the outside that occurs, we\u2019re pretty much the first ones they call,\u201d said Suffolk County Undersheriff Kevin Catalina, a former gang investigator in the New York City Police Department (NYPD) Intelligence Division.\n\nFor instance, after a series of shootings in Bellport, corrections officials were able to quickly produce intelligence that the shootings were connected.\n\n\u201cWhen we were able to pass that information along to our partners on the outside, they were amazed -- first of all that this existed within the jail and [secondly] that we were able to extract it and get it back out so fast,\u201d Catalina said. \u201cAs a result of that, that kind of reverberated throughout the Suffolk County Police Department, and now we\u2019re getting more and more inquiries from detectives regarding crimes on the outside.\u201d\n\n\"The turnaround is so quick, it\u2019s like a different level of respect,\" said Suffolk County Sheriff's Office Sergeant Joseph Nasta.\n\nChris Francescani/ABC News\n\nMarrying old school tactics to new technology\n\nStill, veteran corrections officials are skeptical than even sophisticated technologies like AI will permanently change the culture inside prisons and jails.\n\n\u201cYou hope that the technology doesn\u2019t make the people lazy, make them less effective at walking the ranges, talking to the inmates, getting that feeling, you know?\u201d Hood told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. When you walk into a prison in the morning, most senior wardens know if there\u2019s something going to jump off, whether there\u2019s something going on, just because of the expressions on some of the inmates\u2019 faces, the confidential informants, you could just feel it in the air.\"\n\nShaffer said that over the years he has developed what he described as a profound respect for the imaginative ways in which prisoners subvert rules inside correctional facilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant game of cat and mouse \u2013 as we figure out an intervention, inmates figure out a circumvention. Certainly it\u2019s getting better. It\u2019s better than it ever has been.\u201d\n\nSharon Steinmann/AL.com via AP, FILE\n\nOne ongoing technological concern is contraband cell phones.\n\n\u201cOne of the things driving the market in [contraband] cell phones is to get away from being monitored and recorded,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cAnd the cost of a contraband cell has escalated in prison \u2013 and it used to be astronomical.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has been testing out technology for years that would detect the use of contraband cell phones insides corrections facilities, but has yet to find a cost-effective method that doesn't lead to unintended consequences, like jamming the cell phones of civilians in and around urban facilities.\n\nPrisoners' rights activists point out that the AI technology to mass-monitor phone calls is being used in not just prisons but jails, where many of the inmates have been charged but not convicted of a crime, and may not be able to afford bail.\n\n\"I can already envision what\u2019s about to happen,\" said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, an inmate advocacy group that's critical of the commercialization of the corrections industry. \"LEO creates a partnership [with the telephone providers], and passes on a cost to the inmate. They will be using surveillance to help with prosecutions, investigations and law enforcement. But the majority of people in jail are pretrial, and are subjected to additional levels of surveillance because they can\u2019t afford bail -- and that really seems unfair and subjective. Rich people can get bail and not be subject to this added level of surveillance.\"\n\nHood, the former supermax warden, said he remains wary of the relentless march of surveillance technology.\n\n\"That\u2019s great stuff,\" he said in a phone interview. \"But I do fear a little bit about how much intelligence will [eventually] get outside the prison -- where you\u2019re starting to look at conversations like the one we\u2019re having right now.\"\n\nABC News' Josh Margolin contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
