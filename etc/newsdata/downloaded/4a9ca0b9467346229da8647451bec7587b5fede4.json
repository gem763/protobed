They will result in a provision of about $780 million related to the cancellation of the existing coal contracts, which will be recognized in BHP's December 2019 half-year results.\n\n\"It's good for the environment, it's good for emissions, but it's also great business,\" Malchuck told reporters in London.\n\nChile has taken a lead in renewable power, and costs there for wind and solar energy have plunged.\n\nAnother mining major, Anglo American, said in July it would use only renewable sources to power its mines in Chile beginning in 2021 following another deal signed with Enel's Chilean subsidiary.\n\nBHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said he expected the trend to continue globally.\n\n\"As part of global decarbonization, similar moves from coal more or less directly to renewables may be required over the coming decades in other countries, particularly those without access to cheap gas,\" he said.\n\nBHP, Anglo American and other miners also say they are seeking to reduce water use, especially as many mining operations are in arid areas.\n\nIn Chile, BHP said it was working to eliminate the depletion of aquifers in the desert regions where it operates. It has a goal not to source water from aquifers by 2030 and is instead investing in desalination plants.\n\n(Reporting by Barbara Lewis; Editing by Dale Hudson; Barbara.hm.Lewis@thomsonreuters.com ; +44 207 542 2932; Reuters Messaging: barbara.hm.lewis.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - BHP, the world's biggest miner, said on Monday it had signed four renewable energy contracts to supply all of its Chilean copper operations beginning in 2021, cutting energy costs by 20%.", "authors": ["Barbara Lewis"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
