The uptick followed a strong performance from Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet at the Oct. 10 French-language debate, but H\u00e9bert said the resurgence has been long in the making.\n\n\"Francophone Quebecers are a majority in the province, but they are very mindful of the fact that they are a French-speaking minority, not only in Canada but across North America.\"\n\n\"And so they collectively react to the level of the temperature out there, towards their difference.\"\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau says Quebecers need to think twice about voting for the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois because it would bring back a government like the one led by former prime minister Stephen Harper. 0:39\n\nFederal party leader were in the province in recent days, making final pitches to voters.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said that his party represented change, adding that a Conservative government \"would be an ally to all Quebecers.\"\n\nSpeaking in Montreal Wednesday, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau asked Quebecers to support his party, arguing that a vote for the NDP or Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois could help elect a Conservative government.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh visited Jack Layton Park in Hudson, Que. on Wednesday, where he spoke about the legacy of former NDP leader Layton, who won 59 seats in the province in 2011.\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
