Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, rose 13% to $68.13 a barrel. If sustained, the moves would mark some of the biggest intraday gains for crude in years and put oil prices at the highest level in months.\n\nThe damage from Saturday\u2019s attacks, a blow unlike any global oil supplies have seen since the first Gulf War, risks jolting energy markets and points to the still-pivotal role played by Saudi production.\n\nPresident Trump said late Sunday he had authorized the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed to stabilize energy markets. The president also said he had \u201cinformed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States.\u201d\n\nshare your thoughts How concerned are you about spikes in oil prices after this strike? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe strikes knocked out 5.7 million barrels of daily production, and the officials said they still believe they can fully replace it in coming days. That would require tapping oil inventories and using other facilities to process crude. One of the main targets of the attack was a large crude-processing plant in Abqaiq.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to have 2 million barrels a day back online\u2026by tomorrow,\u201d by Monday, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nSaudi officials discussed shipping their own extra inventory to meet short-term supply needs, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe U.S. is now the world\u2019s largest crude producer and among the top exporters of oil and gas, making it somewhat protected against any possible supply shock. And the U.S. has the capability to lift output at home, but probably not quickly enough to replace sidelined Saudi barrels.\n\nA significant boost in prices would be a shot in the arm for shale producers, who have been under tremendous pressure from investors to restrain spending and focus on profits.\n\nIn the near term, many analysts expect the biggest effects to be felt in Asia, estimating that China, Japan, India, Korea and Taiwan account for about four million barrels a day of consumption of crude from Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi Arabia has for decades been the stable oil producer global markets turn to in times of crude crisis. But the attack at the heart of its oil complex is testing Riyadh\u2019s role.\n\nAmin Nasser, CEO of government-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, said early Sunday that work is under way to restore production. The company will issue a progress update sometime Tuesday.\n\nIt will take weeks to return to full production capacity at the damaged facilities, according to people familiar with damage estimates in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAramco has determined that its facilities were hit by missiles, people familiar with the matter said. A U.S. government assessment determined that up to 15 structures at Abqaiq suffered damage.\n\nThe assessments came as Aramco executives and Saudi officials evaluated the damage to Abqaiq and Khurais, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oil fields. The strikes forced the country to suspend more than half of its output, representing nearly 6% of global supply.\n\nIranian-aligned Yemeni Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, though the U.S. has said it believes Iran is responsible, which Tehran has denied.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely worse than what we expected in the early hours after the attack, but we are making sure that the market won\u2019t experience any shortages until we\u2019re fully back online,\u201d a Saudi official said.\n\nBefore strike, left.

That conflict, which led to an international military intervention, saw the loss of four million barrels a day. The IEA last carried out an emergency release of its strategic reserves when a Libyan civil war in 2011 took out production capacity of 1.7 million barrels a day. The U.S. often acts alongside the IEA, but could also act on its own.\n\nFor the first time in decades, a U.S. president would be in a position to help stabilize the oil market in the event of a prolonged outage\u2014a remarkable turnaround from the 1990s and 2000s, when the country had far greater dependency on foreign crude.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted late Sunday that the attack could have an impact on oil prices and that he had authorized oil to be released \u201cif needed, in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. reserve holds more than 600 million barrels of oil. Mr. Trump could also temporarily ease sanctions on Venezuela or Iran or alter trade restrictions that have affected U.S. crude exports.\n\nBut sustained Saudi outage of several million daily barrels would rattle markets, because of the lack of other players big enough to step in and provide enough supply to cover the shortfall longer term.\n\nEven if Saudi officials were successful in restoring all or most of the lost production, the attack demonstrates a new vulnerability to supply lines across the oil-rich Gulf.\n\nTankers have been paying sharply higher insurance premiums, while shipping rates have soared in the region after a series of maritime attacks on oil-laden vessels, which the U.S. has blamed on Iran.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also long been the target of attacks from Houthi rebels, but the country had until now avoided an attack that disrupted such a big share of its output.\n\nKhurais produces about 1.5 million barrels a day and Abqaiq, the world\u2019s biggest crude-stabilization facility, processes seven million barrels of Saudi oil a day, turning crude into specific grades, such as Arabian Extra Light.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the mother ship of the Saudi energy system,\u201d Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said of Abqaiq. \u201cThis is probably the worst infrastructure attack we\u2019ve seen in the kingdom.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring the heightened risks, a tanker owned by Bahri, the Saudi Arabian oil shipper, had increased its security while sailing in the Persian Gulf Saturday, according to the vessel\u2019s captain. Safety measures included creating a restricted area on the shore side of the ship, deterring waterside access to the ship and additional security briefings to the crew.\n\nAramco has long been known for robust redundancy measures, which may help Saudi Arabia quickly restore production. The attack will be a crucial test of how effective those redundancies are.\n\nThe Ghawar field, the world\u2019s largest, and the Shaybah field, which produces a million barrels a day, also reported disruptions due to Abqaiq\u2019s problems, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe strikes are the latest assaults in recent months by the Houthis and Iranian-backed armed groups in Iraq, which have hit Saudi airports, a desalination plant and oil infrastructure. Since the Houthis took control of Yemen\u2019s capital, San\u2019a, in 2014 in a civil war, a Saudi-led coalition has fought to reinstate a government there supported by regional powers.\n\nIn normal times, the kingdom would have stepped in to bring relief to global markets rattled by geopolitical concerns. But the incident comes as its oil stocks are historically low and calls into question its cushion of spare capacity\u2014idle wells it can normally open at will.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has also depleted its crude oil stocks to the lowest levels in 10 years, so the country alone does not have the same robustness to Middle East interruptions as it used to have,\u201d said Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at Rystad Energy.\n\nSome analysts remain optimistic that energy markets will eventually stabilize. One reason: Inventories in industrialized nations have been rising this year. Stockpiles in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries rose to 2.93 billion barrels in July and were about 20 million barrels above their five-year average, the IEA said in a recent report.\n\n\u2014Sarah McFarlane, Catherine Lucey\n\nand Bradley Olson contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com, Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com", "description": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil company expects to restore roughly a third of crude output disrupted due to a weekend attack by day\u2019s end on Monday, Saudi officials said, a step back from earlier hopes that it could quickly resume full production by the start of the week.", "authors": ["Benoit Faucon In London", "Summer Said In Dubai", "Amrith Ramkumar In New York", "Benoit Faucon", "Summer Said", "Amrith Ramkumar", "Benoit.Faucon Wsj.Com", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com", "Amrith.Ramkumar Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107280/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
