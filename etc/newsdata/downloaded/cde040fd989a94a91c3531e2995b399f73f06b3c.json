The companies are scheduled to deliver both versions of the NGSW and ammunition within 27 months, according to the announcement.\n\nOTA is a spending authority designated for research and prototyping efforts. Army Contracting Command did not respond to a query by press time.\n\nThe Army's goal is to select a final design for both weapons from a single company in the first quarter of 2022 and begin replacing both M4s and M249s in an infantry brigade combat team in the first quarter of 2023, Brig. Gen. David Hodne, director of the Army's Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team, told Military.com in July.\n\nUS Army Sgt. Melissa I.
