It\u2019s good we are having a national discussion about how best to address such concerns. But when someone suggests we need a law to solve our problems, it\u2019s time to pause and take a breath. And take another breath \u2014 or maybe book a meditation retreat \u2014 if someone claims we need a whole new federal bureaucracy.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what some have done. Scholars at the University of Chicago\u2019s Stigler Center recently called for the creation of a new federal Digital Authority to oversee everything from privacy and mergers to discrimination and online addiction. Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.) have a similar proposal for a 1,600-employee U.S. Digital Privacy Agency, which would regulate the way tech companies handle data. President Barack Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser Jason Furman wrote for the U.K. competition authority a report suggesting a new digital regulator might be needed. Australia\u2019s competition regulator recently recommended something similar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn its face, a single expert agency, laser-focused on one set of problems, sounds sensible. But history shows that such industry-specific agencies are most susceptible to \u201cregulatory capture,\u201d a term used to describe when an institution is dominated by the industry they are charged with overseeing \u2014 for example, when a state board that sets the rules for the practice of dentistry is dominated by practicing dentists.\n\nThe idea was popularized by the Stigler Center\u2019s namesake, Nobel economist George Stigler, who argued that \u201cregulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit.\u201d In his foundational paper \u201cThe Theory of Economic Regulation,\u201d Stigler warned that any regulated industry has strong incentives to form close connections with its regulators to seek favors. The inevitable result, he argues, is that industries disproportionately influence the agency\u2019s agenda, shape its rulemaking and even supply it with personnel.\n\nCompanies find it much easier to influence narrowly focused institutions than institutions with broader law enforcement mandates. Where the latter hear from a wide range of companies with a variety of concerns, the former hear only from one type of company. Think about how much easier it is to talk your way out of a speeding ticket from the local police officer, who knows your family, than it is to deal with an effectively anonymous city cop who pulls over dozens of drivers a day. Similarly, big companies would much rather deal with a select group of bureaucrats whom they know well \u2014 and who hear only their perspective most of the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCaptured agencies don\u2019t hold companies accountable; instead, they act to benefit the industry\u2019s established players, disadvantaging newer firms and the public at large. In worst-case scenarios, such agencies can block new, disruptive competitors that threaten the established, regulated industry.\n\nThe recent report from the Stigler Center holds up the Federal Communications Commission as an example of what a new Digital Authority could look like. But the FCC is a perfect example of the likely problems of an industry-specific regulator. At nearly every turn, with every new potentially disruptive communications innovation, the FCC (and its predecessor, the Federal Radio Commission) did the bidding of the best-connected incumbents. As former FCC chairman Michael Powell said, \u201c[T]he history of the FCC is, when something happens that it doesn\u2019t understand, kill it. We tried to kill cable. We tried to kill long-distance. When [MCI founder] Bill McGowan start[ed] stringing out microwave towers that threatened AT&T, the FCC tried to stop him. The FCC tried to kill cable because it was going to threaten broadcasting.\u201d While it didn\u2019t halt technological progress or competition, it often slowed it, occasionally by decades.\n\nFor example, almost immediately after its creation, the Federal Radio Commission sided with industry players when it rejected the expansion of AM radio bands at the behest of existing commercial broadcasters. Later, the agency slowed the development of FM radio to protect AM radio manufacturers. It cracked down on early \u201ccommunity antenna television\u201d (cable TV) to protect the broadcast television industry; conducted \u201cbeauty contests\u201d to parcel out valuable broadcast licenses, sometimes to the politically connected (such as President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s wife); and slowed approvals and imposed onerous regulations on satellite radio services to protect traditional radio stations. The FCC also transfers billions of consumer dollars between various telecommunication competitors in pursuit of several different connectivity goals \u2014 an exercise that brings everyone to Washington to petition the FCC for a share of the money.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThinking forward, the FCC\u2019s history suggests that a single digital regulator would make it easier for existing companies to lobby for processes that restrict new competitors. Even regulations that are intended to promote competition could easily become barriers to new competitors. Similarly, new digital business models could be delayed or blocked by regulators who are too familiar with the existing way of doing things to imagine new pathways to success.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of price controls: Fixing prices with competitors is anticompetitive \u2014 unless the government is the one setting the prices. And where private price-fixing agreements are unstable (since it only takes one defecting party to ruin the agreement), government-mandated prices are conveniently government-enforced. A single digital regulator could provide a simple mechanism for guaranteed profits. Imagine a digital ad industry regulated like the FCC regulated the AT&T telephone monopoly for more than 40 years.\n\nSo what is the alternative? As I noted earlier, regulators are less susceptible to the interests of individual companies and interests when they hear from a lot of different companies with a lot of different interests. Thus, generalist agencies that broadly regulate many industries are more resistant to capture. Further, agencies that primarily enforce laws (like the DOJ) are far less attractive targets for regulatory capture than those that mostly write rules (like the FCC). A company that manages to get in bed with the former might be able to dodge a lawsuit or put pressure on a competitor, but that pales before the possibility of influencing rules that reshape a company\u2019s entire industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the United States, we already have an economywide enforcement agency: the Federal Trade Commission. Charged by Congress to promote competition and to protect consumers, the FTC has decades of experience addressing antitrust and consumer protection issues in the tech industry. Even now, it is pursuing investigations into digital companies under its current authority. And if new capabilities are needed to police digital companies, doesn\u2019t it make sense to give such authority to an experienced agency that has been resistant to regulatory capture?\n\nLike many Americans, I am concerned about today\u2019s Internet-related challenges. But I hope our representatives will take a breath and focus on using and improving the tools we already have.\n\nAD", "description": "It would just lead to regulatory capture, a situation in which an industry effectively controls the institutions that are supposed to oversee it.", "authors": ["Neil Chilson", "Neil Chilson Is A Former Chief Technologist At The Ftc", "A Senior Research Fellow For Technology", "Innovation At The Charles Koch Institute."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/f6deyZBNZGN18C7E3ID3wVTolxw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ATL7NYGPDEI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
