She was talking about this man all the time.\n\n'It was X this and X that... it was obvious she had a soft spot for him. She'd go and see him in the evenings, paying \u00a313 each way for a taxi.\n\nLeah Croucher, 19, was last seen in Furzton, Milton Keynes just after 8.15am on February 15. Her family last saw her at around 10pm the evening before\n\nMrs Croucher and her husband John believe Leah (pictured) could have been deceiving them when she told her family that she had stopped seeing the engaged man\n\n'It just wasn't like Leah to do things like that - she'd always been such a home-loving person and didn't like going out much.\n\n'Then we found out he was engaged.\n\n'I remember saying to Leah: 'Don't you go falling for him, he will never be yours.' I was under the impression that she'd stopped seeing him then.'\n\nMrs Croucher and her husband John believe Leah could have been deceiving them, and said they believed she had secretly stayed the night with him at a local Travelodge.\n\n'Her behaviour changed, ever so slightly.\n\nLeah (pictured) disappeared the day after Valentine's Day on February 15 and despite a widespread public appeal to find her, nobody has come forward with information\n\n'I didn't really take much notice at the time but now, having had eight and a half months to think about it, I realise she had become a bit more moody, which was totally out of character.'\n\nLeah was last seen by her parents on the evening of February 14 after she told them she had been going to see a friend.\n\nLeah was then seen again on CCTV the day after, heading to work in Milton Keynes, but has not been seen since.\n\nEarlier this month police searched the Blue Lagoon lake in Milton Keynes, after a member of the public described spotting a grey hooded top in the water.\n\nLeah was wearing a distinctive grey 'Stewartby' taekwondo hoodie with a colourful logo at the time she went missing.\n\nMiss Croucher's parents John and Claire Croucher held an emotional press conference in February appealing for information\n\nThere was been a widespread effort to find Leah involving a poster and social media campaign and a \u00a35,000 reward for information and appeal on Crimewatch.\n\nShe was last seen in Furzton, Milton Keynes just after 8.15am and was walking towards work.\n\nHer parents today said from September 2018 the normally placid 19-year-old became 'a little bit snappy', slightly more argumentative and would go up to her room and sulk.\n\nBut her parents put it down to normal teenage behaviour.\n\nMrs Croucher continued: 'Leah had never been like many other teenagers. She was happy to be at home reading her Twilight books about vampires.\n\n'She didn't like nightclubs and I had to force her to go to the pub after her 18th birthday.\n\n'She finally went but came home saying it was too expensive and not much fun.'\n\nPolice have spoken to the man and say they have no suspicions about him because it is thought he has an alibi for the time that Leah vanished.\n\nOn Saturday February 3, twelve days before Leah disappeared, she announced she was going to book a hotel room and have a girlie night with two female friends, drinking alcohol and gossiping.\n\nMrs Croucher said: 'To be honest, I didn't think anything of it.\n\n'I was pleased she was getting out and it seemed quite a normal thing for young people to do. I know her brother has done the same when he goes for a night out.'\n\nEarlier this month officers searched the Blue Lagoon lake in Milton Keynes in their investigation into her disappearance\n\nPolice have released this photograph of a grey hoodie similar to the one Leah was last seen wearing\n\nLeah's dad dropped her at the Jury's Inn at Central Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire and waved goodbye as she walked off.\n\nIt was only much later, when her bank statement arrived some time after Leah's disappearance, that the Crouchers realised their daughter had lied to them.\n\nThe mother continued: 'Her statement showed she had booked a room at the cheaper hotel nearby - the Travelodge.\n\n'We checked with her friends, of course, and they said they hadn't been with her that night.\n\n'We believe she was with X, but did not want to tell us.'\n\nCCTV of the Travelodge had been wiped out by the time the lie was discovered, so there is no record of the assignation.\n\nClaire and John are asking anybody who was in that area on February 3 between 6.30pm and 8.30pm to rack their brains to see if they remember spotting Leah.\n\nMiss Croucher has not spoken to any family or friends, used her bank cards and or been on social media since going missing\n\nIt is possible she and her companion went for a drink or food beforehand in one of the nearby pubs or restaurants.\n\nLeah was thought to have wore her black coat, black jeans and black rucksack.\n\nLooking back, Claire realises there have been other little clues that Leah was having an affair and had perhaps fallen head over heels in love for the first time.\n\nThere was the mysterious outing on Valentine's night, the night before Leah vanished.\n\nShe left home between 6pm and 7.15pm, telling her mum she was seeing a friend.\n\nBut checks showed she never saw that friend and police, despite numerous appeals, have never established where she went or why she was with.\n\nClaire said: 'You'd think there would be evidence on her phone records of a secret relationship, but there is nothing.\n\n'But then we know she always used Snapchat, and chats are wiped out on that.. Or, of course, the man could have supplied her with another phone, a secret phone.'\n\nMrs Croucher admits she wavers desperately between two theories.\n\nThe first is that Leah ran away deliberately with someone she knew and has either chosen not to return or is being held against her will.\n\nThe second is that she was snatched off the street and is no longer alive.\n\n'I try not to think of the second one, but as time goes on it's there... I get bad days where it won't go away and I cry and cry,' Mrs Croucher said.\n\n'I desperately want her to be alive but we are going through absolute hell.'\n\nShe tries to comfort herself with the fact that Leah was an expert at self-defence, and had studied at her dad's martial arts club since she was a young child.\n\nShe continued: 'How would anyone manage to take her against her will without anybody else seeing anything?\n\n'I've walked the route she took to work and it's busy - you are visible to other people and passing cars all the way, particularly at that time in the morning when everyone is going to work or school.\n\n'So then I try to convince myself of the first theory - that she has run away - and I think why would my daughter choose to cause so much hurt to us, the people she loves.\n\n'It's just not what Leah would do and it doesn't make any sense at all.'\n\nBut then Mrs Croucher remembers Leah as a little girl, talking about her dreams for the future.\n\nShe said: 'She's always been crazy about vampire books and she used to say that all she wanted was to meet a 'bad boy' vampire and be with him.'\n\nLeah knows her dad's mobile number off by heart because it was very similar to her own. She added: 'We live in hope that one day it will ring and it will be her.\n\n'No matter what she has done or who she is with, we will never stop loving her. There is nothing that we can't work out, and we want her to know that.'\n\nAnyone with any information can contact police on 101 quoting reference 43190049929 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.\n\nThere is a \u00a35,000 reward for information leading to Leah's return.", "description": "The 19-year-old (pictured) of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, who disappeared in February, had been seeing the man since the summer of last year, her parents Claire and John revealed today.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20366844-0-image-a-9_1572427977276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
