It has grown into a sort of informal first responder to big global hacks and cybersecurity incidents. Members share information and intelligence to identify and isolate cyberattacks or vulnerabilities quickly, and disseminate information to protect against their rapid spread.\n\nWhile largely working under the radar, the group\u2019s collective expertise on security has long been valued by governments and companies. The group\u2019s board of directors includes representatives from multinational companies including Cisco Systems Inc., CSCO -1.10% Hitachi Ltd. HTHIY -0.31% , Siemens AG SIEGY 0.88% and Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR -1.19% The cybersecurity arm of the Department of Homeland Security and the U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre are both members.\n\nHuawei didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about the suspension. The company has said the U.S. is \u201cusing every tool at its disposal\u201d to disrupt its operations.\n\nThe step effectively freezes Huawei out of discussions among members of the group over matters such as software glitches. That could slow the company\u2019s ability to patch or fix holes in its own systems. Huawei will also no longer have access to sensitive discussions within the group\u2019s so-called Special Interest Groups. Those groups share details on cybersecurity vulnerabilities between member organizations. It also won\u2019t be able to use an automated platform for sharing information on malware.\n\nThe trigger of Huawei\u2019s suspension, according to a memo to members viewed by The Wall Street Journal, was legal advice provided the group following changes last month to U.S. export rules.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe group, in the email to members, said the suspension was temporary and was taken after changes to U.S. rules to restrict technology exports to Huawei. The group said there wasn\u2019t clarity on what that covered, but that its lawyers had determined that some of the information shared on mailing lists, in its working groups and between members could fit the U.S. definition. It said it was working with U.S. officials to reinstate Huawei.\n\nA spokesman for First said that \u201cafter extensive consultation and review, we regret ending up in a position where we had to suspend Huawei\u2019s membership.\u201d\n\nWashington has repeatedly raised security concerns about Huawei\u2019s operations, saying it can be compelled by Beijing to spy on its behalf, a charge the company has repeatedly denied. The White House has placed pressure on allies to reconsider the involvement of Huawei in delivering sensitive communications infrastructure, including 5G network rollouts around the world.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com", "description": "Huawei Technologies has been suspended from membership in a global trade group of companies, governments and experts set up to tackle computer security breaches and share information about vulnerabilities.", "authors": ["Anna Isaac", "Anna.Isaac Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108150/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
