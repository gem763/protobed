Anchoring it all, meanwhile, is Broadway star Ben Platt (\"Dear Evan Hansen\"), who is given several excuses to sing, mostly, well, because.\n\nPlatt plays Payton Hobart, the adopted son of a filthy-rich family, who sees a student-body election as his steppingstone to an eventual leap into national politics and, ultimately, the White House. Driven beyond words, he's surrounded by a handful of like-minded acolytes, who obsess over \"polls\" and firmly believe Payton when he says \"I'm on a singular path\" to greatness.\n\nStill, there are plenty of hurdles, even in this nascent stage of his political endeavors, starting with the matter of finding a running mate for the race. Checking off boxes, Payton settles on a girl with cancer (Zoey Deutsch), though the uplifting nature of her story is clouded by her overbearing grandmother (Murphy regular Jessica Lange, vamping it up even more than she does in \"American Horror Story\"), who seems a little too enamored with the freebies associated with the teen's plight.\n\nElsewhere, the over-the-top trappings include Gwyneth Paltrow as Payton's mom, and Bob Balaban as her much-older husband -- a May-December relationship if ever there was one, which seems ripe for stepping out on the side.\n\nRead More", "description": "Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series looks like an underachiever, despite cast that includes Ben Platt, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lange", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190920144138-the-politician-netflix-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
