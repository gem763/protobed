McCabe looks like he's going to be charged and prosecuted,\" he said. \"Think about how corrupt the senior levels of the FBI have been -- Two massively critical inspector general reports against [former FBI Director James] Comey, and McCabe has been under criminal investigation.\n\nUS ATTORNEY RECOMMENDS PROCEEDING WITH CHARGES AGAINST MCCABE, AS DOJ REJECTS LAST-DITCH APPEAL\n\n\"Why did CNN hire this guy?\" said Levin. \"They knew he was under investigation. This is, by the way, a rhetorical point.\"\n\nLevin, host of Fox News' \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" and former chief of staff to Attorney General Edwin Meese, said on his program McCabe has had a busy public life since leaving the FBI.\n\nHe pointed to McCabe's television appearances, including in his role as CNN contributor, and referenced his headlining of a Lancaster County, Pa. Democratic Committee banquet later this month.\n\n\"McCabe has been all over TV, he's been at Democratic events for fundraising... he wrote a book, made money from a book -- unbelievable.\"\n\n\"He didn't have a right to leak -- even against Comey's wishes,\" Levin continued. \"If he wanted to speak, he should've spoken on the record, but he didn't -- he's a coward just like Comey.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarlier Thursday, Fox News learned U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu recommended moving forward with charges against McCabe, despite an appeal to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen from the former FBI official.\n\nA source close to McCabe\u2019s legal team said they received an email from the Department of Justice which said, \"The Department rejected your appeal of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s decision in this matter. Any further inquiries should be directed to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.\"\n\nMcCabe spent 21 years with the FBI. He became the acting director in May 2017 after President Trump fired Comey.\n\nFox News' Jake Gibson and Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "Radio host and constitutional attorney Mark Levin said Thursday that CNN should never have hired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired from the bureau last year by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Levin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
