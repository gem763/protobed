Those responsible for violence should be held to account. Let the spirit of unity prevail across #Iraq,\u201d she said.\n\nThe protests over chronic unemployment and poor public services that began Tuesday have escalated into a broader movement demanding an end to official corruption and a change of government.\n\nThey have been largely spontaneous and led by mainly young male protesters who have insisted their movement is not linked to any party or religious establishment.\n\nThe protests have presented the biggest challenge yet to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, who came to power a year ago as a consensus candidate promising reforms.\n\nOn Friday the premier appealed for more time to implement his reform agenda in a country devastated by decades of conflict.\n\n\u201cThere are no magic solutions\u201d, he said.\n\nBut his pleas for patience appear to have underestimated the intensity of public anger, and several top figures have thrown their support behind the protesters.\n\nFirebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr \u2014 whose bloc of 54 lawmakers is the largest in parliament \u2014 called on the government to resign and for snap elections to be held under UN supervision.\n\nSadr\u2019s movement has the power and organisation to bring large numbers of supporters onto the streets.\n\nIraq\u2019s Shiite spiritual leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani used his weekly Friday sermon to urge authorities to heed the demands of demonstrators, warning the protests could escalate unless clear steps are taken immediately.\n\nAnd parliament speaker Mohammed al-Halbusi vowed to push for reforms over employment and social welfare, telling protesters \u201cyour voice is being heard\u201d.\n\nBut the protesters who have hit the streets over the last five days have been contemptuous of existing political factions in the country.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 The top UN official in Iraq deplored five days of violence during protests that has killed nearly 100 across the country and wounded", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/fb4036_an-iraqi-demonstrator-flashes-victory-sign-demonstration-in-baghdad-saturday-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
