What\u2019s the plan, Stan?\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere\u2019s no coherence. He has no foreign policy. He seems to act on a whim. \u2026 The way he is operating in Syria has made it highly unlikely that we would be able to repeat an event like [the Baghdadi raid] any time soon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden lamented that Trump\u2019s own friends and officials have essentially tricked him into leaving some troops in Syria by telling him he could control the oil there and referred to a U.S. official telling The Post: \u201cThis is like feeding a baby its medicine in yogurt or applesauce.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like dealing not with a commander in chief, but a whiner in chief,\u201d said Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre.\u201d\n\nSeveral outlets have reported that Trump allies including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) persuaded Trump to reverse his complete pullout of U.S. troops from northern Syria by showing him maps of the oil fields. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to control the oil fields and the money they make.\n\nAD\n\nObama administration officials always made clear the United States was not in Iraq to steal the country\u2019s oil, Biden said, because that\u2019s exactly what the terrorists allege in their propaganda. \u201cThere was a reason for that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s a recruiting tool.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBiden\u2019s argument for leaving some U.S. troops in Syria also puts him in disagreement with his main primary competitor, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who said at the last debate she would pull all U.S. troops out of the Middle East. Warren\u2019s campaign later clarified she would leave \u201cnon-combat\u201d bases, whatever that means.\n\nBiden said there\u2019s a middle ground between committing hundreds of thousands of troops to overly ambitious interventions and deploying the military for limited missions to lead coalitions and help local partners fight common enemies. In fact, he noted, that\u2019s how we got Baghdadi.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe death of [Baghdadi] is proof in the wisdom of the strategy, that without committing our troops to endless wars, you can still in fact protect our interests and the interests of friends and allies,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou need people on the ground. You need allies on the ground.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBiden said he worked to keep some U.S. troops in Iraq in 2011, but the Iraqi government simply wouldn\u2019t agree to acceptable terms. That\u2019s true, although many in the Obama White House at the time called the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq a campaign promise fulfilled.\n\nRegardless, Trump has yet to explain to anyone how his Syria pullout enhances U.S. security or what the plan is now for preventing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia and Iran from reaping the benefits. That total lack of strategy also undermines the security of U.S. allies, including Israel and Jordan, Biden said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Trump] has any sense of geopolitical concerns that exist, where interests lie, why we need allies and why we don\u2019t need forever troops,\u201d said Biden. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to understand that the ability of ISIS to reconstitute itself is real.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAssad will now have free rein to brutally take over the last few provinces of Syria still free from his control, Biden said. Iran will complete its long-sought project to control a land bridge from Tehran to Beirut. Israel will be dependent on Moscow for protection. Our allies will conclude that the United States can\u2019t be trusted to honor its commitments.\n\nLike Trump, Biden heaped praise on the U.S. national security professionals who planned and executed the mission to get Baghdadi. But Biden said Trump was simultaneously disrespecting those professionals by ignoring their advice and constantly attacking them in public and private, because of his perception they are undermining his agenda.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t take them seriously, apparently. He treats them like the \u2018Deep State,' \u201d said Biden. \u201cI can only imagine \u2026 what the pros must be thinking now. It\u2019s got to be an absolute morale buster.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBiden\u2019s plan to run on his foreign policy credentials is not without risk. The Democratic primary electorate and the country in general are weary of military interventions. But Biden is betting that Trump\u2019s actions on Syria have woken up more Americans to Trump\u2019s lack of knowledge and lack of strategy \u2014 and that voters still believe in American international leadership.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Biden is betting that Trump\u2019s actions on Syria have woken up more Americans to Trump\u2019s lack of knowledge and lack of strategy.", "authors": ["Josh Rogin", "Columnist Covering Foreign Policy", "National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZNLn2YMVuMef014xFynq5N6ra1U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WS3QTZHYJYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
