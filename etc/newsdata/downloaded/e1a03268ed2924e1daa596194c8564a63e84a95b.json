For nearly four years, however, Halabi has been denied his proper day in court, instead forced to endure an endless series of stop-go proceedings in which key witnesses are barred from testifying.\n\nHis most recent hearing on Wednesday was no different, quickly hitting a dead end soon after it began.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s hearing was cancelled shortly after it started because the witnesses were not present,\u201d Halabi\u2019s brother, Hamed, told Middle East Eye. \u201cThe prosecution then threatened that any witnesses who come from Gaza to give their testimony will be detained.\u201d\n\nThey do not want anyone to prove them wrong. All the eyewitnesses and even the officials at World Vision gave proof that he was innocent. But this is not what the prosecution is looking for.\n\nThe Israeli government has denied travel permits to crucial witnesses in the former charity worker\u2019s case, preventing them from leaving Gaza to give testimony in Israeli courts. Halabi\u2019s lawyer, Maher Hanna, says that guarantees he cannot receive a fair trial.\n\nOne of those witnesses \u2013 the owner of a company implicated in the alleged money transfer scheme \u2013 \u201ccould totally undermine the accusations they made against Muhammed,\u201d Hanna told the Times of Israel. \u201cHe has begged Israel to allow him to go to the court and testify, but they have not permitted him to do so.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso on rt.com Palestinians love living under occupation, ex-IDF chief declares, recycling apartheid talking point\n\nA father of five from Gaza\u2019s Jabalya refugee camp, Halabi has maintained his innocence since his 2016 arrest and refused to confess to the charges, according to his family, despite facing pressure and even threats from judges. His father said that at one his hearings, a judge promised \u201clong term imprisonment\u201d if Halabi did not admit to collaborating with terrorist groups.\n\n\u201c[The judge] threatened him and tried to force him to confirm the accusations in front of everyone,\u201d Halabi\u2019s father told Middle East Eye.\n\nHalabi\u2019s family also says he has suffered \u201chorrific torture\u201d at the hands of Israeli authorities during several interrogations, including beatings, humiliation and forced sleep deprivation.\n\nAlso on rt.com 1,700 Gazans shot by IDF face amputation due to funding crisis, UN warns\n\nA former employee at World Vision said Halabi\u2019s case was part of an ongoing attack on the charity\u2019s aid work in the Gaza Strip and other Palestinian territories.\n\n\u201cThere was a political attack on the organisation given that one of its main offices is in the United States,\u201d the employee, who wished to remain anonymous, told Middle East Eye. \u201cThe Israeli lobby in the US must have played a major role in impeding the work of the organisation.\u201d\n\nHalabi\u2019s father seconded that take, adding \u201cThey know very well that he is innocent, but they cannot release him after four years of interrogation and torture and prove themselves wrong.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Vigorous response\u2019: Israel strikes Gaza after Hamas drone \u2018drops explosive\u2019 on IDF vehicle\n\nLike this story?
