REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nWith more than 1,200 athletes from 97 countries competing in 14 disciplines, including 3X3 basketball, bouldering, beach tennis, beach handball, beach wrestling and wakeboarding, the five-day event is by no means a small affair.\n\nIt was initially to be hosted by San Diego but the American city pulled out over finances in May, with Qatar quickly stepping in to take over.\n\n\u201cIt has been an interesting couple of months for us but luckily we had almost all qualifications done,\u201d said Gunilla Lindberg, secretary-general of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC), founders of the event.\n\n\u201cIn principle, we just moved from one place to another. There were a lot of logistics preparations. I am impressed,\u201d Lindberg told Reuters in an interview.\n\nQatar organizers are repurposing many of the facilities, including hotels, used during last week\u2019s World Athletics Championships.\n\nBoth competitions face the issue of scorching desert temperatures in the Gulf state. Walking races and the marathon during the world championships began in the middle of the night to avoid the heat.\n\n\u201cWe looked at it before. Of course it is still warm. But the athletes at the beach games are more used to competing in warm weather,\u201d Lindberg said.\n\n\u201cWe also don\u2019t have long endurance competitions. The aquathlon is much, much shorter than a triathlon. When we had a team chiefs\u2019 meeting a month ago, it was 48 degrees Celsius. Now it\u2019s 34.\u201d\n\nThe event also hopes to fill the stands of the mostly temporary venues, mainly at Katara beach, and avoid the thousands of empty seats that embarrassed organizers at the World Athletics, by giving spectators free access to all venues.\n\nLindberg said ANOC would evaluate the World Beach Games later this year to determine their future.\n\nBut it is already planning an Oct. 15 talk with the International Olympic Committee and other sports organizations to discuss future cooperation.\n\n\u201cYes, it is a very crowded sports calendar. But we still think there is room for the competition. Not everyone can compete at the Olympic Games or the continental games.\u201d\n\nAmong the event\u2019s assets are its relatively low budget. Lindberg said the Qatar event would cost between $20 million and $25 million.\n\n\u201cWe want to open it up for smaller nations to be able to have a worldwide event without complicated venues and expenses. Here they put up provisional venues. It is a low-budget project,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe told them we don\u2019t want big opening ceremonies, big expensive venues. We want beach competitions where athletes are happy and enjoying themselves in their competitions.\u201d", "description": "The inaugural World Beach Games starting on Saturday in Qatar want to squeeze into an already crowded international sports calendar with what organizers hope is the right mix of sun, sea and a low budget.", "authors": ["Karolos Grohmann", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439154885&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990DY-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
