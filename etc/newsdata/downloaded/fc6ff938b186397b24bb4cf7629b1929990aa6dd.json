On this week's \"Face the Nation\", Defense Secretary Mark Esper provided new updates on that front.\n\nHere's the big takeaways from Sunday's episode of \"Face the Nation\" with Margaret Brennan\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper tells \"Face the Nation\" U.S. to evacuate Syria:\n\nU.S. \"preparing to evacuate\" remaining troops from northern Syria, defense secretary says\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper announced\n\nWhat Esper said: \"We find ourselves, we have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies, and it's a very untenable situation,\" Esper said. \"So I spoke with the president last night, after discussions with the rest of the national security team, and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria.\"\n\nWhy that matters: With a full blown U.S. retreat from Syria, ISIS footholds are now vulnerable again and Kurdish forces are left to fend for themselves against the onslaught from Turkey.\n\nSchiff says whistleblower may not need to testify in impeachment probe\n\nSchiff says whistleblower testimony \"might not be necessary\" in impeachment probe\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, suggested\n\nchairman of the House Intelligence Committee, What Schiff said: \"Given that we already have the call record, we don't need the whistleblower, who wasn't on the call, to tell us what took place during the call,\" Schiff said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, referring to the July 25 call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president. \"We have the best evidence of that.\"\n\nWhy that matters: While lawmakers were keen on hearing from the whistleblower directly, looking to protect the individual during possible testimony at great lengths, it shows that Mr. Trump's threats to expose his/her identity are being taken seriously.\n\nGOP lawmakers balk at Trump's Syria policy, Ukraine contact\n\nU.S. leaving Kurds \"to the wolves\" with \"weak\" Syria withdrawal, Kinzinger says\n\nRepresentative Adam Kinzinger and Senator Ted Cruz both parted ways with President Trump on two key issues: Syria and Ukraine. Kinzinger suggested that Mr. Trump was risking national security with his new Syria policy, while Cruz took issue with the president's rhetoric toward Joe Biden.\n\nboth parted ways with President Trump on two key issues: Syria and Ukraine. Kinzinger suggested that Mr. Trump was risking national security with his new Syria policy, while Cruz took issue with the president's rhetoric toward Joe Biden. What they said: Asked on \"Face the Nation\" whether Trump's comments about China probing the former vice president were \"appropriate,\" Cruz said \"of course not.\" He added, \"Elections in the U.S. should be decided by Americans and it's not the business of foreign countries, any foreign countries, to be interfering in our elections.\"\n\nFull interview: Senator Ted Cruz on \"Face the Nation\"\n\nKinzinger\n\nWhy that matters: Two Republicans publicly sparring with the president shows clear signs that the party is being pushed to its limit on defending Mr. Trump. When it comes to foreign policy matters, top brass, including Trump allies like Cruz, are not willing to part with their base and platforms.\n\nCBS News poll finds Americans want Trump to comply with inquiry\n\n\n\nWhile the White House has remained adamant that they will not comply with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's impeachment inquiry, a new CBS News poll\n\nWhat the poll found: Support for the inquiry itself remains distinct and relatively higher than belief that the actions deserve impeachment, an important separation to make. The nation remains split over whether or not President Trump should ultimately be impeached over his actions regarding Ukraine, with one in five feeling it is too soon to say.\n\nSupport for the inquiry itself remains distinct and relatively higher than belief that the actions deserve impeachment, an important separation to make. The nation remains split over whether or not President Trump should ultimately be impeached over his actions regarding Ukraine, with one in five feeling it is too soon to say. Why that matters: In principle, a majority of Americans (including most Democrats and independents) say a U.S. president should not be able to ask other countries for help with U.S. election campaigns. While Republicans' views were mixed on this, it shows a growing consensus that the American public is at odds with how the president is using his office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The president's new strategy in Syria has much of the political world, including members of his own party, rebuking his policies", "authors": ["Emily Tillett"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/13/8c748500-a705-4ead-94c8-d968c24a9792/thumbnail/1200x630/2590af90174fc24b6514411576e3fdaf/20191013-ftn-cam-2-esper-pretape-frame-29885.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
