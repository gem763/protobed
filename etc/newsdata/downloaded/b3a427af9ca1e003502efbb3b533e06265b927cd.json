Your attitude and engagement to fans is outstanding. Keep it up!\u201d\n\nMany Facebook users also jumped on the opportunity to continue fans\u2019 long-running petition for a Razer-made toaster. One of them wrote: \u201cI will tag (you in) anything about toaster XD.\u201d In response, Tan defiantly wrote: \u201cOK unlikely I\u2019ll follow then.\u201d\n\nAnother Facebook user wondered aloud how the lawyer-turned-entrepreneur manages to carve out time for fans despite his busy schedule.\n\nTan\u2019s (very prompt) reply to that comment was a cheeky: \u201cMaybe I should be working harder\u2026.nah\u2026\u201d\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - He said he wanted to \"track the latest news from our top fans\"..
