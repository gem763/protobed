Apple\u2019s $160 AirPods, for example, don\u2019t offer any features for blocking out or reducing noise from your surroundings and aren\u2019t sweat-resistant. They also don\u2019t come with tips in varying sizes to accommodate different preferences.\n\nThat all changes with the AirPods Pro, the company\u2019s newest wireless headphones that launch in stores on Wednesday and cost $250. The upgraded AirPods now support noise cancellation, using outward and inward-facing microphones to cancel out sound before you hear it. There\u2019s also an option to switch to transparency mode, which lets you hear sound from the world around you along with whatever content you may be listening to through the AirPods. And they\u2019re now sweat resistant, so you should be able to wear them during a workout or in light rainy conditions without worrying.\n\nWith the AirPods Pro, Apple is closing the gap between its popular earbuds and the competition, especially as the space continues to get even more crowded with newcomers like Amazon and Microsoft. By launching a pair of high-end headphones alongside its regular AirPods, Apple is also following a strategy its pursued with other products in recent years, like the iPhone and iPad.\n\nOverall, Apple\u2019s new AirPods offer meaningful improvements over the regular version that will make a bigger difference for most people than the jump between Apple\u2019s first- and second-generation AirPods. I\u2019d have to spend more time using them before I can make a judgment call, but this feels like the upgrade that owners who purchased AirPods back in 2016 have been waiting for.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief look at my first impressions after spending just a couple of hours with the AirPods Pro.\n\nDespite their different design, the AirPods Pro feel very similar to regular AirPods when worn \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nIf you already find Apple\u2019s standard AirPods to be comfortable, you can expect the AirPods Pro to fit just as well. But since the Pro earbuds are designed to cancel out noise, they fit a bit more snugly and securely than their predecessors since they properly seal your ear.\n\nCompared to the regular AirPods, you\u2019ll also notice that the AirPods Pro have a much shorter stem but a wider earpiece that\u2019s generally larger. They still feel just as lightweight.\n\nThe noise cancellation works well enough to make a difference during a loud commute or in a busy office.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nDuring my first hour with Apple\u2019s new AirPods, I wore them during a quick walk around New York City\u2019s Financial District and while I worked in my office.\n\nThe noise cancellation feature worked well enough to dull the sound of busy traffic and boisterous construction as I strolled around downtown New York. When I set up shop in my office\u2019s kitchen to work for the rest of the afternoon, the earbuds successfully drowned out the voices of coworkers chatting nearby.\n\nThe difference between the AirPods Pro and the regular AirPods in this regard is certainly noticeable: I could subtly hear the muffled voices of my coworkers in the background, but couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying with noise cancellation turned on using the AirPods Pro. I noticed when I switched to the standard AirPods that much more sound was able to get through and I was able to make out words and sentences.\n\nOne of my only gripes with Apple\u2019s standard AirPods has been that it can difficult to commute with them in New York City given how loud the subway typically is \u2013 especially as trains screech and grind to a halt. The AirPods Pro should help with this.\n\nIf you want to be able to hear what\u2019s happening in your surroundings, you can also kick the AirPods Pro into transparency mode. This can be done through the Control Center on your iPhone or by pressing and holding on a groove located on the AirPods Pro\u2019s stem.\n\nThe touch controls are responsive and more comfortable than some alternatives.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nAs previously mentioned, you can press and hold sensors located on the stems to perform certain actions through the AirPods Pro. A long press switches between transparency and noise cancellation mode, while a quick press pauses or plays music or answers a call. You can also press twice to skip forward or three times to rewind.\n\nAlthough Apple\u2019s original AirPods may have earned some ridicule back in 2016 because of their elongated stems, the AirPods Pro gave me a new appreciation for this design. It makes it easy to quickly find exactly where you need to press if you want to perform an action like pausing or switching to transparency mode without using your phone. Gesture options for other devices, like the Echo Buds, often entail pressing and holding on the part of the bud that fits in your ear, which I\u2019ve always found to be uncomfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell, but if you have an aging pair of AirPods, this may justify the upgrade.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nEven after spending just about two hours with the new AirPods Pro, I can tell that they improve on the originals in a few important ways.\n\nThe new design feels lightweight and comfortable and even more secure than their predecessors. And the noise cancellation is bound to make them much more useful compared to regular AirPods, especially for those who plan to use them in a noisy gym, during a bustling city commute, or to drown out distractions in a busy office.\n\nThe real question is whether or not they\u2019re worth the higher price, and that largely depends on what you\u2019re priorities are and how much you\u2019re willing to spend. Chances are, if you have an iPhone, you\u2019re probably already eyeballing a pair of AirPods over rivals like the Galaxy Buds and Amazon Echo Buds, both of which are priced at $130.\n\nI\u2019ll have to spend more time using them before providing a more definitive recommendation, but if that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll probably want to take a look at the Powerbeats Pro as well \u2013 they run on the same chip as the AirPods but offer longer battery life and are a bit cheaper.\n\nIf you\u2019re deciding between the AirPods and AirPods Pro, your choice will boil down to how important features like noise cancellation and wireless charging are to you. If you\u2019re the type of person that wears headphones throughout the work day, it might be worth spending the extra $50 to get noise cancellation compared to the $200 second-generation AirPods with the wireless charging case.\n\nBut if you just want the basic AirPods experience \u2013 headphones that connect to your iPhone quickly and effortlessly and offer decent sound quality, without frills like wireless charging, it may be worth sticking with the cheaper $160 standard pair.\n\nOur full review will have more details about how the AirPods Pro compare to the regular version, what the sound quality is like, and more.", "description": "Business Insider - Apple's new AirPods Pro offer noise cancellation, sweat resistance, and other enhancements that may make it worth upgrading from the regular buds..
