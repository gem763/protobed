REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina/Files\n\nThe United States on Friday imposed a new round of sanctions on Iran, some aimed at its central bank and sovereign wealth fund, following attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia that Riyadh and U.S. officials have blamed on Iran.\n\nIran denies involvement in the attacks, which initially halved oil output from Saudi Arabia. Responsibility was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement, an Iranian-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen\u2019s civil war.\n\n\u201cThis is a sign of U.S. desperation ... When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 has failed,\u201d Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in remarks shown on state television.\n\n\u201cBut this is dangerous and unacceptable as an attempt at blocking ... the Iranian people\u2019s access to food and medicine,\u201d Zarif said, speaking after arriving in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly next week.\n\nMeanwhile, unconfirmed reports on social media said a number of Iranian websites \u2014 including those of some petrochemical firms \u2014 were under a cyber attack. There was no immediate official comment, and the websites of the main state oil company NIOC appeared to be functioning normally. Residents said their internet access was not affected.\n\nThe fresh sanctions target the Central Bank of Iran, which was already under other U.S. sanctions, the National Development Fund of Iran \u2014 the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2014 and an Iranian company that U.S. officials say is used to conceal financial transfers for Iranian military purchases.\n\nZarif said he would meet on Wednesday with foreign ministers of the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was agreed with Britain, France, Germany China and Russia as well as the United States.\n\n\u201cAs we have said before, the United States can only attend if it returns to the (nuclear accord) ... and ends its economic war against Iran,\u201d Zarif said.\n\nThe United States withdrew from the accord last year and re-imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran.\n\n\u201cI hope the U.S. government realises that they are no longer the only economic superpower in the world and that there are many countries that want to benefit from the Iranian market,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said, according to state media.", "description": "Iran's foreign minister on Saturday denounced renewed U.S. sanctions against its central bank as an attempt to deny ordinary Iranians access to food and medicine, and said the move was a sign of U.S. desperation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432258147&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K05Q", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
