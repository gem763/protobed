If he falls short on the second reading vote, he has no way forward for his Brexit deal.\n\nThe EU would then offer to delay Brexit, potentially for even more than the requested three months. An election would probably be the only way forward - if Mr Johnson can get MPs to agree to it.\n\nIf he gets the second reading vote through but fails to get his debate timetable up, Brexit cannot happen by the end of this month. Mr Johnson would probably pull the legislation and demand an election to break the impasse. Again, there are no iron-clad guarantees he'll get the required votes in parliament to hold an election.\n\nIf he gets the second reading vote through and MPs agree to his timetable, he's still not out of the woods. A breakneck debate on amendments to his bill will follow, in which opposition MPs will try to reshape his Brexit deal.\n\nMr Johnson has warned that any attempt to add riders - such as a second referendum or a customs union covering the whole of Britain - would fundamentally alter his deal. He'd then probably again pull the bill and push for an election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if Mr Johnson does get the bill through in a form he can live with, and keeps his coalition of supportive MPs together, he's then got to power the bill through the House of Lords over the weekend - also a tall order, in a motley chamber given to ponderous proceedings and the odd filibuster.\n\nParliament is finally at a turning point on Brexit. AP\n\nAnd even if the does that, he's then got to persuade the European Parliament to reconvene for a special sitting next week - they're currently scheduled to be in recess - and get them to ratify the deal too.\n\nSo there's only a single, fragile route to a Halloween Brexit, and at least five points where the Brexit train could derail and push Britain towards a divisive and uncertain election.\n\nIt's a bare-knuckle ride ahead. Tonight Mr Johnson finds out if he's even been given a ticket.", "description": "If MPs back the British PM, he stands a chance of delivering Brexit next week.
