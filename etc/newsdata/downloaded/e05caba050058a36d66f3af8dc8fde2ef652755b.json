The Tigers received 1,476 points, two more than Alabama, for the closest margin between 1 and 2 since No. 1 Florida State was two points ahead of Auburn on Oct. 5, 2014.\n\nNo. 3 Ohio State was not far behind with 1,468 points. Eight points separating first from third is the fewest in the regular season since Dec. 3, 1979, when No. 1 Ohio State was 10 points ahead of No. 3 Southern California, with Oklahoma in between, two back of the Buckeyes.\n\nAlabama received the most first-place votes this week with 21. LSU and Ohio State both got 17 first-place votes. No. 4 Clemson received seven first-place votes.\n\nThe Alabama-LSU game is scheduled for Nov. 9 in Tuscaloosa, but the top of the rankings should be locked until then. LSU, Alabama, Ohio State and No. 5 Penn State are all off next week, and No. 4 Clemson is tuning up against Wofford.\n\nOklahoma became the third top-six team in the last three weeks to lose to an unranked team, falling at Kansas State and dropping five spots to No. 10.\n\nPOLL POINTS\n\nThere was a lot going on at the top of the ranking this week.\n\nThis is the second time this season the No. 1 team won and dropped out of the top spot. Preseason No. 1 Clemson was the first, back in late September. The last time it happened twice in a season with different teams was 2009, when Florida and Alabama dropped out in consecutive weeks.\n\nThe last time the No. 1 team did not receive the most first-place votes was Nov. 30, 2014, when No. 2 Florida State had 29 and No. 1 Alabama had 25.\n\nThe eight-point margin between the top 3 teams is the closest since 1978, when the weighting of the votes changed to its current format. The smallest margin in the top three in the current format previously was nine in the 1994 preseason poll \u2014 No. 1 Florida, 1,416; No. 2 Notre Dame, 1,414 and No. 3 Florida State, 1,407.\n\nGAMES OF THE CENTURY\n\nBarring some weirdness with the voters next week, Alabama-LSU will be the 26th 1 vs. 2 regular-season game, including conference championship games. The No. 1 team is 15-8-2, including LSU\u2019s 9-6 victory at Alabama in 2011, the last time 1 and 2 met in the regular season.\n\nThe advent of the Bowl Championship Series in 1998, and then later the College Football Playoff, have created frequent 1-2 matchups during bowl season. Overall, No. 1 is 28-21-2. After LSU and Alabama played as 1 and 2 in the regular season, they had a rematch in the BCS championship game in January 2012 won by the Crimson Tide.\n\nIN\n\n\u2014 No. 22 Kansas State returned to the rankings after a brief stint in September.\n\n\u2014 No. 24 Memphis also returned after a one-week stay earlier this month.\n\n\u2014 No. 25 San Diego State is the ranking for the first time since the final 2017 poll.\n\nOUT\n\n\u2014 Texas fell out of the rankings for the first time this season after losing its third game, this time to unranked TCU. The Longhorns\u2019 other losses were to LSU and Oklahoma.\n\n\u2014 Iowa State continues its yo-yo season, falling out of the rankings again after losing at home to Oklahoma State.\n\n\u2014 Arizona State is out again after being upset by UCLA.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nBig Ten \u2014 6 (Nos. 3, 5, 13, 14, 18, 19)\n\nSEC \u2014 5 (Nos. 1, 2, 6, 8, 11)\n\nBig 12 \u2014 3 (Nos. 10, 12, 22)\n\nAmerican \u2014 3 (Nos. 15, 17, 24)\n\nACC \u2014 2 (Nos. 4, 23)\n\nPac-12 \u2014 2 (Nos. 7, 9)\n\nMountain West \u2014 2 (Nos. 21, 25).\n\nSun Belt \u2014 1 (No. 20).\n\nIndependent \u2014 1 (No. 16).\n\nRANKED v. RANKED\n\nNo. 6 Florida vs. No. 8 Georgia. The World\u2019s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party will likely decide the SEC East.\n\nNo. 15 SMU at No. 24 Memphis. First on the line in the AAC West, maybe the country\u2019s most entertaining division.", "description": "The No. 1 vs. No. 2 game between Alabama and LSU in two weeks looks set, though the order of the Crimson Tide and Tigers changed in the AP", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Gerald-Herbert-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
