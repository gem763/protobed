The same caucus rules would apply to these satellite sites, and the events would happen on the same day as the traditional Iowa precinct caucuses.\n\n\u201cThey will show up, participation will happen just like it happens in a precinct caucus,\u201d Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price said in a conference call of the DNC\u2019s Rules and Bylaws committee.\n\n\u201cWe do know there are some parts of the country where there are high-density Democrats,\u201d Price said, singling out parts of Arizona and Florida where he said Iowans spend their winters. \u201cWe expect we might get an application there,\u201d Price said of Arizona.\n\nTraditionally, the first-in-the-nation caucus state has restricted caucus participation to those who show up in person to their local precincts. Caucuses, which take place in one evening, can stretch several hours.\n\nThe DNC had originally required both Iowa and Nevada to expand the accessibility of their caucuses but then scrapped a recent proposal to allow \u201cvirtual\u201d telephone-based voting. The new plan would allow satellite caucus sites in places such as factories and group homes, dependent on an application review by a special committee selected by the Iowa Democratic Party. Applications are due by Nov. 18.\n\n\u201cFor the folks in other parts of the country, we will, as part of the review process, determine whether there are a sizable number of Democrats who are there,\u201d Price said. \u201cFrom there, we will advertise them and work with folks to make sure they know this option exists.\u201d\n\nPrice said \u201caccessibility organizers\u201d would make steer advertising and public information to potential out-of-state sites.", "description": "The idea was floated as part of a larger plan to expand access to precinct caucuses.", "authors": ["Natasha Korecki"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b8/8a/7c3d6978480597acf41ff20233df/190723-bernie-sanders-gtty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
