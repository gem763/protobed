I've visited a lot of pop-ups in NYC, and this is one fans will love. It brings some of the show's most memorable moments to life, including a nod to Joey wearing all of Chandler's clothes and Monica's turkey head, which you can try on for yourself. (And, yes, I most certainly did.)\n\nRead more: Everything \"Friends\" is doing for its 25th anniversary\n\nEvery day from September 7 to October 6, fans will be able to walk through nine spaces dedicated to each of the show's main characters before arriving at the friend's local hangout to order coffee and sit in the iconic space for themselves.\n\nUnless you've already snagged a ticket to the event though, you're out of luck. The pop-up sold out in three hours when tickets went on sale in August. If you're a big fan, you can still swing by. The space has a store with plenty of \"Friends\" merchandise that's open to the public.\n\nIf you're not in town or won't be able to attend, keep reading to see what it's like inside.", "description": "I previewed the anticipated \"Friends\" pop-up that runs from September 7 through October 6 in NYC where fans can see original props from the show.", "authors": ["Kirsten Acuna"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72f420f4fc246bfc01c38f-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
