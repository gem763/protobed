Only 43 percent of Republicans said they expect the economy to improve, down 13 points from the prior quarter. Democrats have been dominated by pessimism about our economic process since the election even as unemployment continued to fall and economic growth exceeded expectations. Optimism among Democrats fell 5 points to 8 percent. Optimism among independents declined just 1 point to 19 percent.\n\nThis partisan reaction suggests that impeachment is playing a role in stifling confidence.\n\n\u201cThe poll was conducted amid intense discussion of impeachment over Ukraine,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman reported. \u201cA separate question found that 56 percent of Republicans are concerned about the negative effects of impeachment on the economy compared with just 26 percent of Democrats.\u201d\n\nWhile the outlook has turned dire, views on the current state of the economy are much less So. Forty-eight percent of the public say the economy is excellent or good, down from 51 percent in May. But that still meant that this number slipped into net negative because those who rate the economy only fair or poor rose to 49 percent, up a one-point from May.", "description": "While Democrats pushed impeachment, the share of Republicans who think the economy will improve over the next year dropped sharply. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Nancy-Pelosi-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
