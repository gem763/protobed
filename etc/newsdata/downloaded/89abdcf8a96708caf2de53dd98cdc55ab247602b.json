The Nationals had dropped four of six.\n\n\u201cI felt I\u2019ve been seeing the ball pretty decent,\u201d Turner said. \u201cToday all four at-bats, I had a good approach. The swing and timing was there as opposed to the last series. I feel good and hopefully roll it into tomorrow and keep going.\u201d\n\nMartinez rejoined the Nationals following a heart procedure that caused him to miss a three-game series at St. Louis. The 54-year-old was back in the dugout four days after a cardiac catheterization.\n\n\u201cI love being back,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cMuch better being in the dugout - a lot of fun. I enjoy every minute of it. Just watching these guys every day and what they do and how they go about their business, they have a good time. They play for each other, which is nice.\u201d\n\nBefore Miami\u2019s 100th loss, the team announced manager Don Mattingly had agreed to a two-year extension. Mattingly was in the final season of a four-year contract.\n\nThe Marlins became the third team to lose 100 games this season, joining the Baltimore Orioles and Detroit Tigers. Miami also had 100-loss seasons in 1998 and 2013.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be playing some good teams and teams that are in the playoffs (hunt) and that is good for us from the standpoint (of) motivation for us,\u201d Mattingly said.\n\nThe Nationals grabbed the lead for good on Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera\u2019s three-run homer off Robert Dugger (0-3) in the fourth inning.\n\nTurner\u2019s 15th homer gave Washington a 1-0 lead in the third. After Miami pulled within one in the sixth, Turner connected against Ryne Stanek in the seventh.\n\nAn\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez (10-8) pitched five-plus innings to reach double-figure victories for the fifth time in his career. Sanchez allowed four runs and six hits.\n\nFernando Rodney pitched a perfect seventh and Daniel Hudson got six outs for his fifth save in nine opportunities.\n\nStarlin Castro homered for Miami and finished with three hits. Isan D\u00edaz and Jon Berti each had two hits and drove in a run.\n\nDugger was charged with four runs and three hits in five innings in his sixth major league start.\n\nVictor Robles\u2019 RBI single gave Washington a 5-2 lead in the sixth, but Miami rallied in the bottom half. D\u00edaz singled home Neil Walker, and Castro scampered home on reliever Wander Suero\u2019s errant pickoff throw to first.\n\nHUDSON\u2019S WORK\n\nHudson recorded a two-inning save for the second time in three games. He allowed three hits and threw 19 of his 28 pitches for strikes.\n\nHudson was working with a pitch count of 30, and Martinez planned to pull the reliever after Miguel Rojas\u2019 at-bat. Hudson got Rojas to ground into a game-ending double play.\n\n\u201cI had a couple of days off, I didn\u2019t throw Wednesday and had an off day (Thursday) so I felt fine,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cI try to go out there and get as many outs as they want me to get.\u201d\n\nFRIENDLY WELCOME\n\nThe Nationals greeted Martinez with hugs when he met them in the dugout before Friday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cOur main concern was his health and we are so happy he is back,\u201d Robles said. \u201cWe felt his absence. He is a manager who always motivates us. You can sense it when he is in the dugout.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: 1B Matt Adams (sprained shoulder) continues to take batting practice but without a timeline for his return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (17-6, 3.49 ERA) has a 21-7 career record against Miami, including 3-0 this season.\n\nMarlins: RHP Jordan Yamamoto (4-5, 4.87 ERA) will make his first start since being activated from the injured list. Yamamoto was sidelined because of a right forearm strain.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Trea Turner welcomed back manager Dave Martinez with two big swings.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/nationals_marlins_baseball_88749_c0-187-4496-2808_s1770x1032.jpg?8fcd48afcc4bc89ecdd59e254fc5cd0d64cb4de4", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
