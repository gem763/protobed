REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Thursday cut its growth forecast for India for the fiscal year that began in April to 5.8% from 6.2% and said a weaker growth outlook will dampen the prospects for fiscal consolidation.\n\nThe ratings agency had lowered India\u2019s growth forecast to 6.2% from 6.8% in August.\n\nIndia\u2019s growth fell to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter led by weak demand for consumer products and stress in the financial sector, prompting the central bank to cut its 2019-20 growth forecast to 6.1% last week from 6.9%.\n\nMoody\u2019s forecast Asia\u2019s third-largest economy would grow 6.6% in fiscal 2020/21 starting next April.\n\n\u201cCompared with only two years ago, the probability of sustained real GDP growth at or above 8% has significantly diminished,\u201d the global ratings agency said in a note.\n\nThe agency expects the government to run a fiscal deficit equivalent to 3.7% of gross domestic product this fiscal year, compared with the government\u2019s target of 3.3%, following New Delhi\u2019s decision to cut the corporate tax rate, which will cost about 1.5 trillion rupees in tax revenues.\n\nIt also said that a long period of weak growth will hamper the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation plans.\n\n\u201cA prolonged period of slower nominal GDP growth not only constrains scope for fiscal consolidation, but also keeps the government debt burden higher for longer compared,\u201d it said.", "description": "Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Thursday cut its growth forecast for India for the fiscal year that began in April to 5.8% from 6.2% and said a weaker growth outlook will dampen the prospects for fiscal consolidation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439168849&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990H3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
