Why did this suspect do what he did?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWe are still looking to determine motive.\u201d\n\nAfter conducting 757 interviews and examining thousands of emails and online documents, police still don\u2019t know what led city engineer DeWayne Craddock to open fire, killing a dozen people and wounding four more, all but one of them a colleague. Police \u2014 who will take another six to nine months to complete their inquiry \u2014 have thus far found no evidence Craddock endured financial stressors or health problems or that he had sought mental-health treatment. They found no documentation of threatening encounters or physical altercations with his co-workers.\n\n\u201cHe was actually described by many that we interviewed as quiet, polite, a nice guy and a good listener,\u201d Gallagher said, a comment that elicited scoffs from some victims\u2019 family members.\n\nCraddock, who had worked for nine years at the city, began May 31, a Friday, in routine fashion: He arrived at the municipal center at 7:16 a.m., went to his desk and checked his email. In hindsight, the first clue of what lay ahead that day came about 10 a.m., when Craddock conducted Web searches for maps of Building 2 and the municipal center. At 10:31 a.m., Craddock, 40, emailed an unremarkable resignation letter to his bosses. One of them accepted it 15 minutes later, according to an unredacted email obtained by The Washington Post, informing Craddock when his last day would be.\n\nIn the afternoon he visited several job sites with two of his co-workers, police said, arriving back at the office shortly before 3:30 p.m. At 3:55 p.m. \u2014 minutes before he began shooting \u2014 Craddock sent a job-related email.\n\nThen, as the workweek neared its end, Craddock armed himself at his car with a pair of .45-caliber handguns, at least one equipped with a sound suppressor and extended magazine.\n\nHe first killed a contractor in the parking lot outside Building 2 of the sprawling Virginia Beach municipal complex, a cluster of government offices just east of a golf course. He then fatally shot a woman on her way out and used his government badge to access the second floor, where his rampage continued.\n\nAfter what Gallagher called a \u201chorrific\u201d gun battle with police, officers approached Craddock to arrest him. He\u2019d been shot but was still conscious \u2014 and kicking \u2014 when officers reached him on the other side of a door through which he had exchanged fire.\n\n\u201cWhen we took him into custody, he was fighting with us,\u201d Gallagher said. Nevertheless, he added, officers tried to render first aid to Craddock as best they could.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to save his life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat did not happen.\u201d\n\nHired as an engineer in 2010, Craddock received satisfactory evaluations from his supervisors until 2017 \u2014 the same year of his divorce \u2014 when he was placed on a \u201cperformance improvement plan,\u201d police said. In 2018 he received a written reprimand from a supervisor for his job performance and was given an \u201cImprovement Required\u201d evaluation, police said.\n\nIn 2019, Craddock was expected to receive a \u201csatisfactory\u201d performance evaluation, Gallagher said. However, shortly before the shooting, Craddock had a conflict with the city\u2019s purchasing department, Gallagher said, without elaborating on what the problem was. Two of Craddock\u2019s supervisors sided with Craddock in that dispute, police said at their briefing.\n\nAfter his divorce, Craddock had become isolated from his family, Gallagher said. Relatives described him as \"introverted,\" \"paranoid\" and \"uncomfortable around people.\" He owned five guns, all purchased legally, and had ordered body armor that didn't arrive in time for the shooting.\n\nTwo days after the attack, City Manager Dave Hansen, who has since resigned, announced that \u201ca very thorough review\u201d of the gunman\u2019s personnel file had revealed no problems.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, the perpetrator\u2019s performance was satisfactory,\u201d Hansen said, adding that Craddock \u201cwas in good standing within his department . . . there were no issues of discipline ongoing.\u201d\n\n\u2018He wants this so bad\u2019: A widower\u2019s quest for answers in Virginia Beach takes its toll\n\nThose statements angered some relatives of the victims, including Jason Nixon, who said that his wife, Kate, had \u201cwritten up\u201d the gunman for poor performance. Another time, Kate \u2014 a compliance manager in the public utilities department \u2014 had called Craddock a chauvinist who disrespected her because she was a woman and outranked him, her husband said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nixon said, police allowed him to view a few of his wife\u2019s journals, including one that mentioned Craddock several times. In some, she criticized him. In one case, for example, she wrote about his not finishing a job. People had complained, but Craddock hadn\u2019t returned their calls.\n\n\u201cHe was defiant,\u201d said Jason\u2019s sister, Mandy Nixon-Hammer, who read that notebook.\n\nHillard Heintze, a Chicago-based firm hired by the city to conduct an independent investigation, also delivered a progress report Tuesday on its work.\n\nArnette Heintze told the council his team had \u201ccontinually heard concerns\u201d from city employees complaining that \u201ca hostile work environment\u201d existed for city employees, specifically African Americans, who felt they \u201cwere being treated differently\u201d from other workers and were subject to harsher discipline. Craddock was black.\n\nTo further examine those concerns and assess whether they had contributed to workplace violence, Heintze said, the agency this week began a survey of all Virginia Beach employees. Heintze said the extensive concerns about the city\u2019s allegedly hostile office culture had created unanticipated work for his team, and along with other factors have led investigators to push back the delivery date for their final report from mid-October to mid-\n\nNovember.\n\nAs police displayed a slide with all of the victims\u2019 photos, tears streamed downed the faces of relatives sitting in the audience.\n\nBy the end of the presentation, several were left unsatisfied.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know really what the point of that briefing was other than to assure the public they\u2019re doing everything they can do,\u201d said Pat Gallagher, who lost his wife, Tara Welch Gallagher, in the shooting. \u201cI didn\u2019t get much out of it. It sounds like they have a ways to go.\u201d\n\nDebbie Borato, whose sister Missy Langer was killed, felt so furious after the presentation that she was shaking.\n\n\u201cRage,\u201d she answered when asked how she felt. \u201cRage.\u201d\n\nShe was upset that the police did not discuss the tense workplace environment her sister had described to her over the phone many times before the mass shooting and that Borato said she felt might have played a role in the incident.\n\n\n\nNixon was equally angry. He resented the police\u2019s description of Craddock as quiet and professional and was deeply disappointed that they didn\u2019t provide a motive.\n\nNixon couldn't understand why the police didn't mention the times his wife had allegedly written up Craddock. At one point during the presentation, he turned to his mother and said, \"That's bull----.\"\n\n\"I just want this to end,\" said Nixon, who earlier in the day had for the first time visited the site of his wife's killing. \"I just want answers. I want closure. And I can't get it until someone tells me the truth.\"\n\nAfter half a dozen interviews, Nixon stood in the center of the room, arms crossed, his voice hoarse.\n\n\"I was hoping for . . .\" he said, his voice trailing off. \"I was hoping for more.\"\n\nIan Shapira and Patricia Sullivan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Suddenly, a kind of hole exploded in my wall.\u2019\n\nHe never expected to be a single dad. Then a gunman in Virginia Beach made him one.\n\nRemembering the victims of the Virginia Beach mass shooting", "description": "Police still do not know why DeWayne Craddock killed 12 people at the municipal center on May 31, according to an interim report delivered Tuesday night", "authors": ["Michael E.
