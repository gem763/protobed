They show Trump was to be at the hotel on Dec. 21, 2007, and the club the following morning.\n\nThe records don\u2019t include anything about Zervos joining him in either place. But Zervos\u2019 lawyer Mariann Wang says the documents \u201cstrongly corroborate\u201d the former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant\u2019s allegations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lawyers for a former \"Apprentice\" contestant who accused President Donald Trump of unwanted kissing and groping in 2007 say records from his own calendar help support her claim.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jennifer Peltz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/10/18/apprentice_contestant_trump_25425_c0-142-2400-1542_s1200x700.jpg?e064e08ab136bcb39bb04f9762b785ac38ead450", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
