The HHHL one will have maximum read speeds of 8GB per second and the same write speed as the U.2.\n\nThe latest PCIe Gen4 SSDs will also come with two new technologies besides fail-proofing.\n\nEach will have SSD virtualisation software that divides a single SSD into 64 smaller units, allowing for multiple users to use it simultaneously and independently. This will allow cloud operators to offer more users services with the same SSD resources and also reduce the virtualisation workload of server CPUs as the SSD itself can handle the load.\n\nIn addition, the newest SSDs will have V-NAND machine learning technology. Using big data, it will allow an accurate reading of data during ultra-fast processing by reading the electricity difference between circuits and cells within a NAND level.\n\nDespite the recent downturn in the memory market where Samsung saw its operating profit halved for the second quarter, the company has continued to launch new products to try and cement its position as a market leader.\n\nIn August, Samsung began producing the industry's first 100-layer V-NAND chip aimed at enterprise SSDs.\n\nIn January, it shipped 1TB eUFS 2.1 aimed at smartphones.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nSamsung launches 5G integrated Exynos 980 SoC\n\nThe SoC combines an application processor and a 5G modem into one chip.\n\nSamsung launches 108 million pixel image sensor with Xiaomi\n\nSamsung's new Isocell Bright HMX image sensor aimed at smartphones boasts 108 million pixels and was made in collaboration with Xiaomi.\n\nSamsung produces SSD with 100-layer V-NAND\n\nSamsung continues to stay ahead of the pack by beginning production of the industry's first 100-layer V-NAND aimed at enterprise SSDs.\n\nSamsung begins production of upgraded 12GB DRAM\n\nThe new DRAM package will power upcoming flagship phones and consist of eight 12GB LPDDR5 mobile DRAMs that will run at a data rate of 5,500Mbps.\n\nGalaxy Note 10 is the perfect phone for power users says Samsung\n\nTaher Behbehani, GM & SVP, Samsung, talks with TechRepublic about the Galaxy Note 10's business features, like a better DeX experience, more integration with Microsoft apps, a new S Pen, and 5G.", "description": "Samsung's fail-in-place technology will allow its 30.72TB PCIe Gen4 SSDs to continue operating smoothly even if a NAND chip fails.", "authors": ["Cho Mu-Hyun"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/19/348b14b0-79f1-4d7e-8ec4-782c8fca82fb/thumbnail/770x578/926409afd1bbf2e1877a28841c1fe550/ssd-hhhl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
