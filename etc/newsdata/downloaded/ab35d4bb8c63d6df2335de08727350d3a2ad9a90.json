Arsenal fans made little effort to contain their fury as they watched their side blow a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Crystal Palace, a result which leaves them cut adrift from the top four in the Premier League.\n\nWhile Granit Xhaka became the main target of their frustrations \u2013 not that he helped himself by attempting to orchestrate the boos which greeted him as he trudged off the pitch with exaggerated slowness, this after the announcement of his substitution was met with an ironic cheer \u2013 the spotlight has turned firmly on Unai Emery in the aftermath.\n\nXhaka may have cupped his ear at the fans, torn his shirt off and marched straight down the tunnel, but it is Emery who had to face the music afterwards and who will ultimately answer for the dire state the team is in.\n\nThough Emery was keen to point to mitigating factors in his post-match presser \u2013 not least the late winner from Sokratis which was ruled out for an imperceptible foul from Calum Chambers in the build-up \u2013 Arsenal have only four wins from their first 10 games in the league and, for those who have been watching closely, the truth is that flatters them. It has been a dreadful start to the season, one which fits into a bigger picture of frustration and regression.", "description": "It didn\u2019t take a PhD in crowd psychology to see that the mood had turned at the Emirates this weekend.", "authors": ["Will Magee", "Jim White", "Jason Burt", "Luke Edwards", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000214333402-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqlyjLB990yNM1ZdswIy1277IA6ju3iZwFEpN0jIgyjrc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
