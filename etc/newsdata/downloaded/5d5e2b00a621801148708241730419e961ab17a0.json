The composition of those publishers is the following:\n\n\u201c200,000 of those are YouTube creators, 33,000 are website publishers or creators, 15,000 are Twitch streamers, and since we announced our support for Twitter tipping on August 1st, 28,000 Twitter accounts have joined to receive Basic Attention Tokens. \u201d\n\nBrave claims high user engagement\n\nThe browser launched its ads on an opt-in basis just over six months ago. Since then, the company reportedly concluded 385 campaigns on its platform and accumulated 97 million ad confirmation events. Brave also claims high user engagement rates with its ads:\n\n\u201cPlatform engagement is extremely high, with a click-through rate of 14% (the industry average is just 2%). More importantly, 12% of click-throughs result in page visits of 10 seconds or longer. There have been 2.36 million 10-second active page visits overall.\u201d\n\nOne campaign provided as an example by Brave is the ads bought by computer chip manufacturing giant Intel for its Intel Gamer Days 2019. In the initiative, the CPU producer used \u201cBrave Ads as a social driver to reward participation for spreading the word about the upcoming Gamer Days events.\u201d\n\nAnother example featured in the announcement was also the latest Brave Ads Grant, which was awarded to The Lupus Foundation of America. As part of the initiative, the foundation verified their website as a Brave Creator and allowed Brave Ads to drive people directly to their site to tip and auto-contribute, in addition to traditional contribution options.\n\nBAT price jumps\n\nAs of press time, cryptocurrency market data platform Coin360 shows that BAT \u2014 currently worth $0.226 per coin \u2014 has seen its value increase by about 11.65% over the last 24 hours.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in September, Brave browser has become more popular than its rivals such as Firefox, Opera and Chrome in Japan.", "description": "Brave browser now has 8 million monthly active users and 2.8 million daily active users, the company says", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNDkyM2Q0ODBmMDcyZGYyNGEzMDAyZDQ1YzBlNDkxOGYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
