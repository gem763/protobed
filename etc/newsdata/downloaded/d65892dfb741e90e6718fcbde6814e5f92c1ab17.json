Three of them live in Los Angeles and train in Fortnite at Gen.G\u2019s North American headquarters. Hannah, who\u2019s 17, is still in high school and lives at home. The women of Gen.G\u2019s Fortnite team were in New York City for the Fortnite World Cup Finals, the highly anticipated $30 million event that was held at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens, a 23,000-seat tennis stadium best known as the home of the US Open.\n\nNone of Gen.G\u2019s players were at the event to compete. Out of the nearly 200 players that participated in the Fortnite World Cup\u2019s solo and duos events \u2014 100 players in each, though some qualified for both competitions \u2014 no female players qualified to play in the main event. (Multiple female players competed in the Celebrity Pro-Am, including Soleil \u201cEwok\u201d Wheeler, a 13-year-old player who announced her signing to top e-sports team Faze Clan during the event.) Though the women from Gen.G, who play together in two separate duos teams, didn\u2019t compete at the event, it was important for them to be there. \u201cI never had [a female role model] growing up in the e-sports scene,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI want to be the role model that I never had for these people.\u201d\n\nFortnite, like colorful first-person shooter Overwatch, has one of the more diverse fan bases in the industry. The Fortnite World Cup was a testament to that: Arthur Ashe Stadium was filled with men and women, with families, with people young and old. In March, developer Epic Games told Engadget that its female player base at the time was estimated at \u201croughly 35 percent.\u201d Women are playing the game \u2014 and not just casually: women are competing in Fortnite at its highest levels. But despite that, women weren\u2019t competing in the solos and duos events at the Fortnite World Cup. The reasons are complex and entrenched.\n\nFans want to support women competing at the highest level, like Gen.G, and to see themselves in top Fortnite players. In New York, a fan called out to the Gen.G Fortnite team while they were walking into the YouTube Creator Lounge, an area set up amid the theme park-like atmosphere at the Fortnite World Cup. Over the noise of the crowd, Perez, Mann, and Gress did not hear the fan \u2014 but Reyes did. Most of the team was already in the lounge when Reyes noticed, but she gathered the group and took them on a mission: to find the young woman who was calling out to them for a picture. \u201cWe literally chased her down as a squad and had a conversation with her and thanked her for supporting us,\u201d Perez said.\n\nLike the Gen.G players, Wheeler wants to be a role model for the women who play the game. \u201cI hope to see more girl gamers play Fortnite,\u201d she told The Verge. \u201cThere are already pro girl gamers in Fortnite, and big girl streamers of Fortnite who play well. I hope that by me joining Faze, they will take their grind more seriously and believe in themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want as many girls to compete as possible.\u201d\n\nThe reasons why there were no women in the main event of the Fortnite World Cup are multipronged. The Fortnite World Cup\u2019s qualifying process was open to anyone above the age of 13, with rounds happening for 10 weeks before the main event. It was meant to bring meritocracy to the game: \u201cIf you can climb to the top, you\u2019ll unlock access to the Fortnite World Cup Online Open tournaments,\u201d Epic wrote in its announcement post. Players could grind in the Arena Mode to qualify for the Online Open semi-finals. Those who made it past the semis would enter the $1 million Online Open finals. The highest-ranked players from there were invited to the Fortnite World Cup.\n\nEpic said that 40 million players participated in the online qualifiers for the event. A gender breakdown of the participants hasn\u2019t been made available, but The Verge has reached out to Epic for more information. Perez estimated that the pool of women that participated was very low, with barriers like harassment or fear keeping women from competing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I want to change,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI want as many girls to compete as possible. We\u2019re all given the same opportunity for this, and I want everyone to capitalize on it. Part of the reason they don\u2019t is that women are afraid that they\u2019ll do bad, or don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re skilled enough, or that they\u2019ll be harassed. That\u2019s what we want to change.\u201d\n\nIt all goes back to an industry that\u2019s historically been uninviting to women, and though that\u2019s changing, it\u2019s been a slow process. We\u2019re seeing more women playing video games than ever before, but there\u2019s still a gap. And that gap feels especially wide when you look at the top levels of the competitive scene. There\u2019s a smaller pool of women trying to compete in Fortnite, and so it makes sense that there\u2019s a smaller pool of women at the elite level. It doesn\u2019t mean that women aren\u2019t as good as men or can\u2019t play at that level, though. Many of Gen.G\u2019s players have, in fact, played at the highest level and won a lot of money doing it. In October 2018, Perez placed fourth in the North American Fortnite Fall Skirmish and won $25,000 with her teammate. \u201cGetting fourth place was super rewarding because not only did we win $25,000, but it was cool to see myself \u2014 a woman \u2014 in the top 50 teams.\u201d\n\nWhen a woman is competing, she\u2019s usually faced with the added pressure of being the only woman. Women in the scene don\u2019t have the luxury of just being another player. \u201cBefore joining the Faze Clan, I was kind of well-known as the deaf girl gamer who got hosted by [Timothy \u201cTimtheTatman\u201d Betar],\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cAfter joining Faze Clan, it was like a validation of me being a Fortnite pro. I got a lot more followers, which is great to see. I hope to inspire many more.\u201d\n\nMost women in e-sports want to be treated like any other player, but plenty are embracing their roles as role models for women in the industry. \u201cRight now, it feels good. There\u2019s motivation from the World Cup,\u201d Mann said. \u201cBut the past few months have been on and off with emotions, a little more pressure because you want to qualify and be a figure for people. It\u2019s hard, I\u2019ll be honest.\u201d Perez said that the team members get criticized a lot more than the average male player because they\u2019re women signed under Gen.G, a tier-one organization. \u201cDay-to-day, we get tweets, clips, or people talk about us on stream very negatively when we kill them [in Fortnite],\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s just our average day, pretty much.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something that other women in e-sports, Fortnite included, experience. During the event, Perez tweeted directly at her fellow women playing Fortnite: \u201cI want to see you girls grind your heart out for the Fortnite Champion Series coming out!\u201d she wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s break the stereotypes and show we can compete too. Gaming is for everyone. Anyone\u2019s name can be on the big screen next year. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nHer message resonated with plenty of her fans, but the response was mixed. In the replies, there was a lot of support, but some people were saying the very same things that Perez believes discourage women from competing. \u201cI want to break the stereotype where women can\u2019t compete,\u201d Perez said. \u201cPeople are out here saying that there\u2019s a reason they didn\u2019t qualify and it\u2019s because they suck. No, it\u2019s because many of them are afraid to play.\u201d\n\nAmong the comments, some women spoke out about the harassment they, like the Gen.G team, face simply for being a woman. Sometimes, it\u2019s bad enough to drive women to not compete. \u201cOne of the main reasons I don\u2019t stream / even try to compete is because how much shit I get for being a girl,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019re trying our hardest to open these doors.\u201d\n\nThe support that Gen.G\u2019s Fortnite team gets from its organization, which fields e-sports teams in Overwatch, Apex Legends, and League of Legends, among others, is essential in their success. Mann told The Verge that the organization treats them the same as any other player group. The women practice at the same high-tech facility that the other teams do, living nearby in Los Angeles. They\u2019ve got the best computers and the highest-quality internet to use. There are coaches, support staff, and streaming facilities. But the help goes beyond just playing the game. Gen.G is especially interested in helping its players deal with the stresses of pro play, and that means therapy and sports psychologists.\n\nPerez said that a lot of professional gamers struggle with their mental health due to the pressure of competing at the highest level and in front of large audiences. Gen.G pays for mental health support, like therapy, which Perez said she has each week. \u201cIf you\u2019re not OK, it\u2019s going to show in your gameplay,\u201d she said. That support is necessary to create an infrastructure where everyone can succeed at Fortnite and other e-sports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying our hardest to open these doors for them, potentially get other women signed to other teams or even under Gen.G as well,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThat\u2019s just our biggest goal right now.\u201d", "description": "There were no women competing at the Fortnite World Cup Finals in New York City, but stars from e-sports teams like Gen.G and Faze Clan are looking to change that by inspiring a new generation of players.", "authors": ["Nicole Carpenter", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wpg5JxrW79-Hs9vRrE93cKsKq-o=/0x429:6048x3595/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18436923/Fortnite_WorldCup2019_PressDay_Candids_00006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-02"}
