Lewandowski is known as one of Trump\u2019s most fiercely loyal aides \u2014 a bare-knuckle political operative with few parallels in modern politics. And he\u2019s also cuing up a potential run for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire, which added a significant subplot Tuesday and perhaps gave him more reason to make a show.\n\nBut a show it was. Lewandowski began the hearing by repeatedly asking his questioners to read the specific portions of the Mueller report they were referring to. Even when they projected the words on the screen, he asked them to read the words anyway.\n\nWhen Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) insisted that Lewandowski read it himself and asked whether he was \u201cashamed\u201d of what was in the report, Lewandowski responded by dryly calling Swalwell, whose 2020 presidential campaign was rather brief, \u201cPresident Swalwell.\u201d\n\nIt was later in that exchange that Lewandowski mentioned his guns. Swalwell asked him whether he puts all of his notes about meetings with Trump in his safe, as he did when Trump asked him to deliver a controversial message to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Lewandowski responded, \u201cIt\u2019s a big safe, congressman. There\u2019s lots of guns in it.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier exchange with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), Jeffries asked Lewandowski whether he was a \u201chit man\u201d or a \u201cbag man\u201d for Trump. Lewandowski responded: \u201cI think I\u2019m the good-looking man, actually.\u201d\n\nRep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) got further than most in penetrating Lewandowski\u2019s stonewalling. He pressed Lewandowski on why he hadn\u2019t delivered Trump\u2019s message to Sessions asking the attorney general to criticize the Mueller probe as \u201cvery unfair\u201d to Trump. The report by then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III says Lewandowski \u201cdid not want to deliver the President\u2019s message personally\u201d and tried to get a Trump aide to do it (which the aide also declined to do).\n\nJohnson asked whether Lewandowski got \u201csqueamish\u201d or \u201cchickened out.\u201d Lewandowski responded that it wasn\u2019t any of that but simply that, \u201cI went on vacation.\u201d At another point, Johnson said: \u201cYou are like a fish being cleaned with a spoon. It\u2019s very hard to get an answer out of you.\u201d\n\nAnd at the beginning of the hearing, ranking Republican Douglas A. Collins (Ga.) accused the Democrats of prolonging the Mueller investigation. \u201cBut as long as we don\u2019t have time, we\u2019ll continue with rerun season,\u201d Collins said. \u201cPopcorn still tastes good. I don\u2019t know why we do this except maybe we just have \u2014 maybe a deficiency of flashbulbs. I don\u2019t know. Because we just like the show.\u201d\n\nThe whole thing might have culminated in this exchange, in which Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) attacked Lewandowski for granting the White House\u2019s request that he not talk about his conversations with Trump \u2014 via executive privilege \u2014 even though he wasn\u2019t a White House aide:\n\nRASKIN: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s privilege to waive because I don\u2019t think it exists, Mr. Lewandowski. I think the whole thing is imaginary. It\u2019s like the tooth fairy. LEWANDOWSKI: My children are watching, so thank you for that.\n\nWhatever Lewandowski\u2019s children \u2014 and any other viewers \u2014 got out of watching that hearing, it wasn\u2019t of much substance.", "description": "A proud day for democracy, all around.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-17-2019/t_d0172c74e5084418a370fc897ddd1b43_name_1c34d058_d980_11e9_a1a5_162b8a9c9ca2_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
