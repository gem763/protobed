She promised her parents she would go to recovery meetings and really make a change.\n\nWhile there, Ashley, now 29, met Jack, now 35, and as they supported each other through tackling addictions, they fell in love.\n\nNow they are married with a one-year-old son Jackson and Ashley, from Riverside, California, USA, has been clean and sober for over two years.\n\nShe said: \u2018Our relationship is so loving and so beautiful it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never experienced before. Neither of us could even imagine picking up a drink or drug because we know it would completely ruin every amazing thing we have going for us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I now have a life I would have never imagined I\u2019d ever have. I believed you couldn\u2019t live life without alcohol or drugs.\u2019\n\nJack and Ashley with their son Jackson and Ashley\u2019s daughter Rylann (Picture: MDWfeatures / @ashleydoherty.recovery)\n\n\u2018I finally have confidence and I\u2019m finally proud of myself. I\u2019ve never felt so peaceful and so happy in my entire life. It would have never happened if it weren\u2019t for recovery.\u2019\n\nAshley first tried alcohol for the first time at 13 and she loved how it made her feel.\n\nShe explained: \u2018My parents split when I was about seven years old and my mum was also in and out of rehab. Assuming those things had taken a toll on me as a little one, I grew increasingly angry and insecure as I got a little older. Alcohol and drugs helped me to numb all of those unwanted feelings and emotions.\n\n\u2018After that first drink, I couldn\u2019t stop. I drank myself into a blackout that night. The next day I couldn\u2019t wait to do it again. I loved the warm, numb feeling it gave me. And from that moment on it was downhill.\n\n\u2018Hanging around with older kids I was introduced to a lot of things early on, from huffing \u201cdust off\u201d and NOS, to smoking weed, and doing cocaine and ecstasy. Drinking before school in the parking lot, in class from a water bottle, leaving the school prom early to go drop ecstasy. For some reason, I never saw any of that as a problem.\n\nAshley at the height of her addiction (Picture: MDWfeatures / @ashleydoherty.recovery)\n\nSoon she was chasing that feeling and using weed, cocaine, ecstasy DMT, meth, oxycontin, cough syrup and painkiller pills at parties because she wanted to feel carefree after a difficult childhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe became addicted and when she had a car accident in 2011, she was prescribed Norco painkillers, causing her to spiral even further.\n\nAt 21, she fell pregnant and decided to give up drugs and alcohol throughout her pregnancy, but after Rylann was born, she was given Norcos for pain and when her prescription ran out, she wanted more.\n\nShe said: \u2018It was a miracle that I stayed away from alcohol and drugs that entire time. As soon as I gave birth to her and they gave me pain meds, it was back downhill again. I started abusing pills when she was two months old and continued breastfeeding the next year and a half while taking them.\n\n\u2018All the while her dad was smoking OxyContin and heroin. I was breastfeeding at the time but just told myself I\u2019m only taking a few so it can\u2019t be affecting my daughter through my breastmilk (though I\u2019m sure it was). I felt guilty and felt like a sh*tty mum but of course, I continued to take them.\u2019\n\nAshley with her daughter Rylann (Picture: MDWfeatures / @ashleydoherty.recovery)\n\nAshley soon fell into a dangerous spiral, doing what she could to take drugs, but she also became good at keeping it from her family. Even though she now had a baby to care for, she would do anything to continue feeding her addiction.\n\nShe added: \u2018That toxic relationship came to an end pretty quickly. I moved into my grandma\u2019s guest house with my best friend because I couldn\u2019t afford to be on my own especially with my daughter. They made sure I always had a job or was in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was a functioning addict, so they had no idea what was really going on behind closed doors. All I was concerned about was going out and getting loaded. Pawning my daughter off on whoever would take her. Paying her dad to take her so that I was free to do what I wanted. He was still using so I knew that if I offered to pay him to take her, he would.\n\n\u2018If someone couldn\u2019t take her, I would just bring the party to me. My daughter would wake up in the morning to find me still loaded from the night before and random strangers around the house. I thank God to this day that she was too little to remember any of that.\u2019\n\nAshley has been clean and sober for over two years now (Picture: MDWfeatures / @ashleydoherty.recovery)\n\nEventually, Ashley was kicked out of school and with no money left, she knew she needed to tell her family how bad her addiction had become.\n\n\u2018I knew my dad was going to lose it,\u2019 she said. \u2018I had reached my breaking point finally and asked him to get me into treatment.\n\n\u2018I stayed in treatment for 45 days. I felt like a whole new person. I welcomed the boyfriend I had when I went to treatment back into my life which was my first mistake. He got in my head and I started to believe that I wasn\u2019t an alcoholic, I just went to treatment for pills. I picked up a drink with him, and the rest of the night is a blur. I went on a drinking binge all over again.\n\nAshley and Jack with their pregnancy scan (Picture: MDWfeatures / @ashleydoherty.recovery)\n\n\u2018My family threatened to send me back to treatment but I promised I would go to meetings and get a sponsor so I did just that. I forced myself to get out of my comfort zone, get a sponsor and make friends at meetings.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere, Ashley met Jack, who had also recently come out of rehab. The couple knew they weren\u2019t meant to date but felt they had an incredible connection.\n\nThey slowly built a relationship while supporting each other through recovery and are now both clean and sober.\n\nAshley talks about her journey on her Instagram page @ashleydoherty.recovery and she wants to help other addicts turn their lives around.\n\nShe explained: \u2018It feels so good knowing I can possibly help and inspire other addicts like myself. For quite some time I felt like maybe my story leading to recovery wasn\u2019t as crazy as others because I never slammed drugs or ended up in jail etc and so why would people want to hear it. Since I\u2019ve decided to just share it anyway I\u2019ve realised how many people there are that can relate.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had people reach out to me to tell me how I\u2019ve been an inspiration to them and it\u2019s just an indescribable feeling. It just feels great knowing I can offer hope to others and show that it is so possible if you want it.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mum creates amazing homemade Halloween customes for little girl\n\nMORE: When does Costa\u2019s Christmas menu launch?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Ashley was addicted to drugs and alcohol but met her husband Jack at a recovery group and they have been clean and sober for over two years.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93922863_1572442979.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
