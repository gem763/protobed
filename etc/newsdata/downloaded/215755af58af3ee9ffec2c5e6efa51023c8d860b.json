Here's what to know to stay safe while hiking", "language": "en", "text": "Nature is beautiful, and also not be trifled with. Just take it from the man who took a wrong turn and got lost for nearly a week or, in a more extreme case, the composer who hoped to spend time with nature and got killed by a bear.\n\nFrom Everest to Hawaii, there have been several recent hiking horror stories that have gone viral.\n\nInsider spoke to experts to see what people should know before they go \u2014 and if getting mauled by a wild animal is really a common cause for concern (spoiler: it's not!)\n\nKaden Laga, 25, was found after five days lost in the woods. Search for Kaden Laga/Facebook\n\nPlan before you go\n\nWesley Trimble, the Program Outreach and Communications Manager at the American Hiking Society and Ben Lawhon, the education director at Leave No Trace, both offered suggestions and advice for hiking safely. It all boils down to planning.\n\nIn 2017, the National Parks Service reported 3,453 search and rescue incidents, 182 fatalities, and 1,500 injuries or illnesses in the great outdoors. This was actually a decrease from the previously recorded data, which counted 5,397 search and rescue missions in the 2015-2016 season.\n\nKyle Brittain, 27, was last seen on August 30 while hiking in Waipio Valley on Hawaii's Big Island. GoFundMe\n\nRead more: A 27-year-old hiker has been missing in a Hawaiian forest for more than a week\n\nWhile hiking mishaps may not be on the rise, it doesn't hurt to do your research so you can avoid getting lost \u2014 or worse. Being prepared is key, both men agreed.\n\n\"Plan ahead and prepare,\" Lawhon told Insider. \"So that means doing the homework before you ever leave your house whether that's an afternoon in your local park or a multi-day backpacking trip.\"\n\nTrimble suggested checking out the American Hiking Society's 10 Essentials of Hiking. The list's name is self-explanatory, sure, but it's important read-before-you-go stuff.\n\nHere's what the AHS suggests.\n\nAppropriate footwear Map and compass/GPS Extra water and a way to purify it. Extra food. Rain gear and extra clothing. Safety items: fire, light, and a whistle. First aid kit. Knife or multi-purpose tool. Sunscreen and sunglasses. Daypack/backpack.\n\nIn short, you can't plan enough.\n\nDon't believe what you hear: Bear attacks are rare\n\nNo matter how much you prepare, you still expose yourself to certain risks when you hit the great outdoors. But bears and other animal attacks should be pretty low on hikers' lists of concerns, both Trimble and Lawhon said.\n\nTrimble said that stories of animal attacks may seem common, but they tend to be \"more sensationalized\" because they play into our \"primal instincts.\"\n\nNot out t get you, despite what you think.

Well, that might take you six hours.\"\n\nMainly, it comes down to common sense \u2014 or perhaps a lack thereof.\n\n\"Oftentimes will want to hike to the bottom of the Grand Canyon,\" he continued. \"Yes, that's downhill all the way in, but it's all uphill all the way out. Obviously, people don't think through that and they don't also think about the fact that it's very, very hot bottom of the Grand Canyon in the summer. So [it's] being realistic about the type of experience you want and then matching that experience with the trip itself.\"\n\nNot a starter hike.

That way, if things don't go as planned, someone will know to alert authorities, if need be.\n\nSocial media exposes beautiful spots \u2014 but also might encourage inexperienced and unprepared hikers\n\nUltimately, both Lawhon and Trimble say that there's probably not an increase in hiking conundrums.\n\n\"Part of it is there are more people enjoying the outdoors. That's clear numbers continue to rise,\" Lawhon said. \"Anytime you have more people out, you have more potential for people to get lost or injured or stranded or stuck outside overnight.\n\nOh, what a world. iStock\n\nTrimble agreed. He said social media platforms, like Instagram, let people know about all the beautiful places out there in the world. But on the other side of that coin, it can lead to more people hiking without being adequately prepared because hiking, as he puts it, has a \"low barrier to entry.\"\n\nNature-focused Instagram accounts offer plenty of inspiration for wanna-be hikers. But be warned: You may see an irresistibly Instagrammable sunset, or cliff, or forest view, but not yet have the experience and skills to get to the spot safely.\n\n\"With greater exposure to these beautiful places more and more people want to get out and see these wonderful places,\" he said. \"But not all of them are prepared beforehand to make sure that they can be well-educated and be safe about being out on the trail.\"", "description": "Nature-focused Instagram accounts offer tons of inspiration for wanna-be hikers.
