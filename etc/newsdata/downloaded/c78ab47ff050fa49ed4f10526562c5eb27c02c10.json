But I wanted to ride Arcadia Queen.\u201d\n\nJames McDonald pilots exciting mare Arcadia Queen to an easy win last month. Getty\n\nOne of the beneficiaries of this clash is Melbourne-based jockey Michael Walker. The mercurial New Zealander has picked up the ride on Caulfield Cup favourite Finche in place of regular jockey Kerrin McEvoy, who will ride Redzel in The Everest.\n\nMcEvoy partnered Redzel to win the first two editions of The Everest, and it\u2019s the fifth favourite for the race again this year, so it\u2019s not hard to understand McEvoy\u2019s decision. And Walker is only keeping the saddle warm, with McEvoy confirmed to ride the import in the Melbourne Cup.\n\nTalking to AFR Weekend at track work at Caulfield this week, Walker says the Everest puts Sydney\u2019s jockeys in a particular bind.\n\n\u201cFor the Melbourne guys there are only a select few horses that will go for an Everest, so that makes it a little bit easier. But for the Sydney jockeys, you can see how many horses have come down from there for the Caulfield Cup,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hate to be in their position \u2013 I think it\u2019s a lot harder for them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker says top jockeys will generally try to retain the rides on the best horses, and it is the programs of these horses that decide where a jockey will ride.\n\n\u201cI can guarantee you the top jockeys know where their horses are going and how they\u2019re going,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got the right horse to win a million-dollar race, you\u2019ll travel.\u201d\n\nThe Everest isn\u2019t the only clash Racing NSW has created as it has pushed aggressively to shake Melbourne\u2019s position as the country\u2019s racing capital.\n\nClashes far from ideal\n\nThe Golden Eagle, a new $7.5 million race to be run for the first time this year at Randwick over 1600 metres, will also give jockeys a headache on November 2, when Flemington plays host to the prestigious Derby Day, with its four group ones.\n\nMark Guest, who manages McDonald, says the clashes are far from ideal for the industry and many of its participants. An easy solution, he says, would be to hold one meeting on Saturday and one on Sunday, giving both the chance to attract maximum attention \u2013 and all of the best riders.\n\n\u201cTime will tell if we made the right decision,\u201d he says of McDonald\u2019s decision to ride in The Everest. \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t have a decision to make.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChampion jockey Damien Oliver will stay in Melbourne on Saturday to take the ride on Mustajeer, the fourth favourite in the Caulfield Cup.\n\nNow in the twilight of his career, but still riding as well as anyone, Oliver takes a strategic view of the clashes.\n\n\u201cIt spreads the riding ranks a little thinner, so it gives more people more opportunities,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe participants are the winners in it, whether they\u2019re in Sydney or Melbourne. It\u2019s an extraordinary amount of money that The Everest is offering, but there\u2019s fantastic prizemoney on offer here.\u201d", "description": "Australia's top jockeys are torn between prizemoney and prestige on one of the biggest weekends on the racing calendar.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3531%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/aef1b932e00900632ba3e8aef220dbd4ac16126d", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
