Renault may back a proposal calling for his exit, a source close to the French carmaker said.\n\nNissan and Renault declined to comment. Mr Nada did not respond to requests for comment about the allegations.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe board discord at Japan's second-largest carmaker illustrates how the turmoil that followed Ghosn's downfall last year deepened with the departure of former CEO Hiroto Saikawa last month. Mr Saikawa was forced to step down after he admitted to being improperly overpaid.\n\nThe internal strife also has implications for Nissan's often difficult relationship with Renault.\n\nTension has since emerged between Masakazu Toyoda, the Princeton-educated former trade ministry official who chairs the nominations committee, and Hitoshi Kawaguchi, who is responsible for external affairs and is seen as having close ties to government, four people familiar with the situation said.\n\n\"The relationship is strained,\" said one of the people, all of whom declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Mr Toyoda and another outside director, Motoo Nagai, were against Mr Saikawa's abrupt resignation last month, given that the board had not yet found a replacement, the person said.\n\nThe Toyoda camp believes that Mr Kawaguchi played a role in helping to set the stage for former CEO Mr Saikawa's departure, the person said. Mr Kawaguchi is also seen as being supportive of acting chief executive Yasuhiro Yamauchi getting the job on a permanent basis, the person said, adding that Mr Toyoda was cautious about Mr Yamauchi.\n\nThe nominations committee is due to meet earlier in the day at Nissan's Yokohama headquarters, with the board itself due to meet in the afternoon.\n\nMr Nada has come under increasing scrutiny after The New York Times reported on Sunday he had received \"unjust enrichment\", citing a review by an external law firm hired by the carmaker.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported that some Nissan lawyers said that Mr Nada, who oversees Nissan's legal department and had previously worked closely with Ghosn on sensitive matters, needed to do more to avoid potential conflicts of interest.\n\nA Nissan spokesman declined to comment on both reports.\n\n\"If the Nissan board proposes calling for (Nada's) exit, Renault representatives will probably vote in favour of the proposal,\" said the source close to Renault. The French company has a 43.4 per cent stake in Nissan.\n\nReuters reported last month that Mr Saikawa's fate was sealed by two external directors who persuaded the board to oust the former Ghosn protege and spare the company more reputational damage.\n\nThe race for the CEO job has been narrowed down to a contest between Mr Yamauchi and former Nissan China chief Jun Seki, who are seen as front-runners, although India-born Ashwani Gupta and a possible external candidate remain in the mix, Reuters reported this month.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [TOKYO] The board of Nissan Motor Co will meet on Tuesday as a split has emerged over the scandal-hit carmaker's next CEO, putting the head of the nominations committee at odds with an influential executive, people familiar with the matter said. .
