Not only is it unloved and underreported, but even as stocks power higher feeding on a bunch of stimuli, including the adage that new highs beget new highs, there is much doubt in the air. There is another old Wall Street adage about climbing a wall of worry, but what about a wall of negative thoughts based on politics, not number-crunching?\n\nAll aboard\n\nEvery all aboard\n\nAnybody want to take this ride\u2019\n\nAnybody want to ride\n\nAll it takes is a nickel or a dime\n\n-Gap Band - \u201cParty Train\u201d\n\nUncle Charlie and the Gap Band were the best-selling R&B group in the early 1990s because of their unique funk and ubiquitous happiness in their music.\n\nThe market once again got stronger into the session and rallied to close at the highs yesterday, but there wasn\u2019t any joy or happiness. The only ubiquity is the disbelief and the theories about why the doom-and-gloom theories didn\u2019t work. And for the smartest mavens, this current leg higher is a part of the ultimate destruction prediction. I guess the higher it goes, the harder it falls comes into play. However, in all seriousness, I\u2019m a little tired of the curmudgeons being right even when they\u2019re wrong.\n\nAs a natural-born contrarian, I\u2019m thrilled the experts are downplaying the rally because there\u2019s a difference between hoping for destruction and coming to such a conclusion of fear or other emotional inputs. Toss in mainstream media, which has taken to the siren call of a recession - they use it for every report on the economy.\n\nDid you see all the reports on more Americans without health care insurers yesterday? Did you see any headlines on how many came out of poverty (a number remarkably equal to those that got off Medicaid), or the number of Americans working full-time jobs, otherwise known as the cornerstone of living?\n\nI didn\u2019t think so.\n\nWhy They Make the Big Bucks\n\nTo be sure, some folks are looking for a big pullback based purely on research, but the loudest voices are all tainted by animosity, not bottom lines or valuations. Of course, it\u2019s one thing to predict doom and gloom, but professional money managers must make their clients\u2019 money\u2026at some point.\n\nHeadlines from Global Money Managers in Bank of America Survey \u2018Fund manager cash levels hit highest point since 2009\u2019 February 2019 44% overweight cash 18% overweight emerging markets 14% overweight FAANG Six-month performance FB +8.7%\n\nAMZN +7.8%\n\nAAPL +23.1%\n\nNFLX -20.2%\n\nGOOG +2.3%\n\nSPX +6.8% \u2018Fund managers haven't been this bearish since the financial crisis thanks to the trade war\u2019 June 2019 21% of global fund managers are underweight stocks the lowest exposure since March 2009.\n\nMarket breadth was good on Tuesday. Yesterday, it moved to a level that underscored a scramble to get positioned in something.\n\nMarket Breadth NYSE NASDAQ New Highs 2,095 2,342 New Lows 830 789 New Highs 102 76 New Lows 6 12 Up Volume 2.73 billion 1.62 billion Down Volume 143 million 667 million\n\nRotation & More\n\nI think the rotation story got too much press yesterday, and money suddenly decided to test this market by finding stocks with the largest short positions.\n\nSemiconductors, coupled with Apple (AAPL), lifted Technology to the best performer by the closing bell.\n\nS&P 500 +0.72% Communication Services (XLC) +0.53% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +0.19% Consumer Staples (XLP) +0.36% Energy (XLE) +0.10% Financials (XLF) +0.57% Health Care (XLV) +0.99% Industrials (XLI) +0.93% Materials (XLB) +0.96% Real Estate (XLRE) -0.23% Technology (XLK) +1.04% Utilities (XLU) +0.99%\n\nWatch the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) today for a potential monster breakout.\n\nApproach\n\nAlso, Consumer Discretionary names were among the worst performers of the session yesterday. I sensed it was coming in part because the hype build-up was too fast. We asked subscribers to take a monster gain on Macy\u2019s (M) even though the idea was only a week old and put on a new tech idea in the model portfolio.\n\nAfter the close, a couple of retailers Oxford Industries (OXM) and Tailored Brands (TLRD) took it on the chin and reminded us that oversold bounces don\u2019t change underlying fundamentals even if they make for great trades.\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 2 1 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 1 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 3 2 1 Technology Utilities Cash 3 0 3\n\nIt\u2019s Happening\u2026\n\nLast night, President Trump reacted to a series of small Chinese overtures with one of his own, which sent equity futures higher.\n\nDonald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump\n\nTrump said the delay came \u201cat the request of the Vice Premier of China, Liu He, and due to the fact that the People's Republic of China will be celebrating their 70th Anniversary...\u201d\n\nDonald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump\n\n\u201c...on October 1st, we have agreed, as a gesture of good will, to move the increased Tariffs on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods (25% to 30%), from October 1st to October 15th. \u201c", "description": "Talk about a stealth rally.
