Yet none of the 2020 Democrats on the stage during Wednesday night\u2019s CNN climate town hall was talking about how to put this kind of coalition together.\n\nLet\u2019s start with nuclear energy.

Yet only Joe Biden\u2019s plan even allows for the possibility.\n\nAll of Biden\u2019s chief primary rivals see Mr. Burns everywhere they look. Elizabeth Warren came out explicitly against it, and Bernie Sanders\u2019 plan would actually stop the building of nuclear power plants and enact a moratorium on license renewals.", "description": "In the fantasy green world Democrats describe at the CNN climate town hall, we\u2019ll solve energy problems with zero pollution and millions of jobs.
