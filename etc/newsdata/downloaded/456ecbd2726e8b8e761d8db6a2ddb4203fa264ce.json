It will be implemented through a government decree.\n\nThe Treasury forecast in December that the web tax would yield 600 million euros in revenues from 2020.\n\nGualtieri also said Italy had just asked the European Commission to present a proposal on minimum taxation for companies across Europe.\n\nEU Economic Affairs Commissioner-designate Paolo Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister, has said he plans to oversee EU efforts to harmonize corporate taxes across the 28-nation bloc.\n\nHe has also said the EU will introduce a tax on digital services even in the absence of a global accord on a web tax.", "description": "Italy's economy minister sees web tax launch next year", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9719I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
