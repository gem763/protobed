I love the country; I love the food; I love the culture and what\u2019s better than playing the host country in a quarter-final? It\u2019s definitely something you need to embrace and I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nThat means embracing the desire of the local population of 126 million wishing to see you lose \u2013 and probably the vast majority of global rugby neutrals who have been entranced by the Japanese rugby fairytale.\n\nBut to Vermeulen it\u2019s just another rugby game, against a unique opponent, whom he knows well, having played club rugby in Japan (as well as in Europe and South Africa).\n\n\u201cThe club teams do everything at 100mph,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s training, it\u2019s fitness, the guys don\u2019t rest \u2013 the work ethic on the field, off the field is fantastic; it\u2019s a fantastic culture.\n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s coming but you\u2019ve still got to stop it. For the South Africans that have played here before we know a little bit \u2013 and it\u2019s better than the guys who haven\u2019t played here before \u2013 we\u2019re a little bit more suited, more equipped.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve still got to pitch on the day. That\u2019s the most important thing for us.\u201d\n\nSpringbok fullback Willie le Roux is also a veteran of Japanese club rugby and will be appearing for Toyota Verblitz after the tournament.\n\n\u201cAfter the 2015 Rugby World Cup I came over to play Top League in Japan and I really enjoyed it,\u201d Le Roux said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very open. When the people back home ask me how I would describe it I say it\u2019s like Sevens rugby played by 15-man teams; very quick; run from everywhere.\n\n\u201cIn the Top League sometimes there\u2019s not much structure and everyone just plays what they see, and it was fun; enjoyable.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese national team has far more structure under their New Zealand coaching team and although their victory over South Africa at the 2015 Rugby World Cup remains a constant theme for local media, the Springboks\u2019 41-7 victory in Kumagaya at the beginning of September perhaps has more relevance.\n\n\u201cJapan bring a different style of play,\u201d said Vermeulen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you\u2019re generally used to, but luckily we played Japan five weeks ago or so we\u2019ve experienced the style they play.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve said that they want to play a 50-minute ball-in-play game and that\u2019s a bold thing to say but it\u2019s also a good thing to chase.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve reached 39 minutes and a few seconds so far, so they\u2019re 11 minutes shy but you never know that might happen come Sunday.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019ve got a specific style, and they pride themselves on that style, and we also have our specific style. But we also need to adapt to their style and see what we can do to counter that.\u201d\n\n- SA Rugby\n\n", "description": "If any of the 248 players left in Japan from the eight World Cup quarter-finalists are feeling the pressure, Duane Vermeulen is not one of them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7745/d2b16defd5794f599b23ff93b88f941b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
