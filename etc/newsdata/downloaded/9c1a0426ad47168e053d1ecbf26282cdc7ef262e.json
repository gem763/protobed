Such a move would give Brown his salary, but take him off the team\u2019s active roster and forbid him from playing in games and practices.\n\nThe list has been used in the past to sideline Adrian Peterson, Kareem Hunt and Reuben Foster following their own personal scandals.\n\nAccording to Schefter, the Patriots \u201cwere caught by surprise\u201d in regards to the sexual assault allegations.\n\nAntonio Brown might have to wait longer than expected to make his Patriots debut.

Brown had previously forced his way out of the Raiders organization with an entire month of unhinged behavior, culminating in the team granting his request to be released.\n\nThe Patriots were likely bracing themselves to handle Brown and all of his behavior, but the allegations against the player might be a different story.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe allegations against Antonio Brown\n\nBrown was accused of three instances of sexual assault between 2017 and 2018 by his former trainer Britney Taylor in a lawsuit filed in federal court on Tuesday.\n\nTaylor reportedly knew Brown from their time together at Central Michigan, where she was a gymnast while he was a football player. She alleges in her lawsuit Brown did the following:\n\nExposed himself to her and kiss her without her consent during a training visit in Pittsburgh in June 2017\n\nMasturbated behind her while the two watched a church service on her iPad and ejaculated on her back in Miami, also in June 2017\n\nPushed her face-first into a mattress and forcibly raped her in Miami in May 2018 after she agreed to train him again with an assurance his sexual advances would stop\n\nIncluded in Taylor\u2019s lawsuit are screengrabs of Brown appearing to profanely brag about the second incident in an email.\n\nBrown denied all allegations in a statement released by his lawyer, and reportedly plans to countersue Taylor for civil extortion.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Antonio Brown was accused of sexual assault and rape the same day the Patriots announced they had signed him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bZ56hfvtYKYItMaPFv2xeA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MTYuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r4nRt0shyuARZYTyDgyYUg--~B/aD0yMTQ4O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/e5336780-2ef4-11e9-bd5d-0ca80ca62ba9", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
