After much discussion, responses of \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cyeah but what about\u201d, one surprise name comes up: Joe Marler.\n\nMarler wasn\u2019t supposed to be here, at least not in Japan. Following the shock decision to retire from international rugby, England moved on from Marler and Marler moved on from England \u2013 the prospect of an eight-week campaign away from his family and recent arrival of his third child was exactly what the Harlequins prop wanted to avoid this time last year.\n\nBut here the 29-year-old is, having started all three of England\u2019s pool games and back in the selection mix for Saturday\u2019s quarter-final against Australia after recovering from a niggling back injury that had ruled him out of the France match that never was.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFrom retirement to team of the tournament in 13 months. Not bad.\n\nBut there is a much bigger reason for Marler\u2019s change of heart than making any select XVs. \u201cI want to be part of a squad that wins a World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was part of the reason I came out of retirement. I could see the potential in this group and I wanted a taste of that. That's ultimately what's driving me on for the next couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Joe Marler (England) Not so long ago the loosehead was in international retirement, yet now he finds himself as one of just five players to have started all three of England\u2019s pool games. Marler stood up to take on responsibility in the absence of first-choice Mako Vunipola, and ensured that his absence did not become a weakness. AFP via Getty Images 3/16 2. Shota Horie (Japan) Arguably the player of the pool stage. Horie\u2019s familiar locks have made him famous for more than just his rugby skills, but it is what he is doing on the field that he deserves praise for. Standout performances against Ireland and Scotland tell you all you need to know about his form so far. Getty Images 4/16 3. Tadhg Furlong (Ireland) Furlong was outstanding against Samoa and has provided strong consistency across the pool stage to help Ireland get back on their feet. With most tighthead props being rotated game by game, it makes selection rather tricky to look for standout moments, but Furlong\u2019s two crunching runs in his most recent outing see him stand out from the rest.

AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe other part is that Marler feels he is in a much better place mentally than he was 12 months ago, when the pressures of playing for his country developed a resentment within him for international duty.\n\nNot only did Marler have to convince Eddie Jones that he wanted this opportunity, but he had to convince himself.\n\n\u201cIt hasn't been easy,\u201d he adds. \u201cI have worked my buns off to try and get back into an emotional and mental state capable of contributing to the squad the best I can. Physically, that has been even harder. You come out of it for a year and you forget how quick and fast they do everything, so it hasn't been easy and I am thoroughly enjoying myself.\u201d\n\nThree games into the tournament, there can be no doubting Marler\u2019s commitment to the cause. His performances on the field are matching those off it \u2013 although his early press conference theatrics have died down for what really is an open, honest and entertaining chat with the British and Australian press. And that\u2019s the thing with Marler, you never quite know what you\u2019re going to get, and sometimes he isn\u2019t entirely sure himself. To answer whether winning the World Cup, as is his want, would be life-changing, he ponders before answering: \u201cI never know whether to be arsey or not. Yes, it would be life-changing...in the sense that we'd have won the World Cup.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an apparent sign that he can still be at conflict with who he is and what is expected of him. Does he want to sit there and answer question after question about his passion, his desire and his mental health? Probably not, but then there is a side of him that enjoys it too. It is a way that he deals with pressure, a different type of pressure to what he faces when wearing the England or Harlequins shirt, but one that perhaps mounts when he least expects it \u2013 in a media huddle, a hotel room away from home, or a changing room when suddenly enough is enough. Sometimes it\u2019s the thought of defeat that can lead to those feelings, which brings Marler to an interesting topic: Cardiff 2013, when England looked to have the Six Nations Grand Slam in their grasp only to have 10 bells knocked out of them by Wales in a humbling 30-3 defeat, that cost them not only the clean sweep but the championship altogether.\n\n\u201cEach individual is different,\u201d he says when asked about how you deal with that pressure to win. \u201cJonny Wilkinson used to speak about the thing that drove him most was the fear of failure, the fear of losing, and that worked brilliantly for him. He was one of the best players ever to play the game.\n\n\u201cJamie George, for example, is Mr Positive, Mr Energy all the time, he doesn\u2019t focus on any of that because that brings him down and he has negative thoughts with it. He constantly thinks about enjoying the moment, the next job. Everyone is different but as a group, as a collective, we focus less on the fear factor, more on the opportunity and the challenge.\n\n\u201cI am more on the spectrum of: I will control what I can control and what will be will be. I\u2019ll give 100 per cent in whatever role I have to play for the team and that\u2019s all I can do. If you expend energy on stuff you can\u2019t control, you\u2019ll be knackered. I am better at that now [compared to 4 years ago] in terms of my mindset.\n\n\u201cI have been involved in teams when we have come close [to that nerve-wracking stage]. I was involved in the 2013 England team where we went down to Wales for the Grand Slam and the feeling amongst the group I remember being really nervous. We were so close, we had just got to win this game.\n\n\u201cOther teams I have been involved in let nerves overcome them and caved in and allowed those nerves to become negative. I don\u2019t feel that in this group. You may turn to me on Sunday and say 'you ballsed that up Joe' if we end up losing, but I don't feel that in this group. I feel the boys embrace that nervousness and use it as a positive energy to drive us on and have a bring it on mentality.\u201d\n\nIt has been a rollercoaster 12 months for Marler, and in fact a rollercoaster career that you sense has involved many more dark days than he lets on. But if England do come unstuck on Saturday and crash out of the World Cup, there will be few who say this time he hadn\u2019t given it his all.", "description": "In a bar, just outside the seaside surf resort of Aoshima, two rugby writers were discussing who should wear the No 1 shirt in the \u2018team of the tournament\u2019 being published the following day.
