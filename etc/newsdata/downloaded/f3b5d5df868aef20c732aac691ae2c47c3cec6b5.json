I am still in shock and wonder how they even came past my CV,' Ms De Assis told News.com.au\n\nTyanna (pictured) was chosen for the role after considering 70,000 applications\n\n'It's crazy. I am still in shock and wonder how they even came past my CV,' Ms De Assis told News.com.au.\n\nShe applied for the job by sending her resume and cover letter across in an email, writing 'Most entertaining PA you will ever have' in the subject line.\n\nNaturally it caught Mr Lepre's attention and he decided to offer her a phone interview, before cementing her position in his company six weeks ago.\n\nWhile she hasn't travelled yet trips to Europe and South America are soon to be scheduled into both of their diaries, living up to Mr Lepre's promise of being a 'dream job'.\n\nMatthew Lepre, who makes $120,000 a month from four successful e-commerce stores, wanted to hire someone to oversee his companies while enjoying luxurious travel arrangements for $52,000 (base rate) a year\n\nWhile she hasn't travelled yet trips to Europe and South America are soon to be scheduled into both of their diaries, living up to Mr Lepre's promise of being a 'dream job'\n\n'Tyanna has experience working for CEOs and directors and is knowledgeable about social media. She is a perfectionist which is perfect for this role and is detail and task-oriented,' Mr Lepre said of his new assistant.\n\nShe has spent much of her life working in public relations and as an office manager, so is used to pencilling in appointments and speaking to clients across continents.\n\nBeing the same age as her boss also makes communication easier.\n\n'The bonus is we don't get sick of each other - sometimes we have to sit together for nine hours straight - we're both scatter brains, we jump from one thing to the next, but it works because I am very OCD and I make sure I get everything down,' she told the publication.\n\n'Tyanna has experience working for CEOs and directors and is knowledgeable about social media. She is a perfectionist which is perfect for this role and is detail and task-oriented,' Mr Lepre said of his new assistant\n\nIn April Mr Lepre told FEMAIL he had received thousands of interested emails from potential employees, with 75 per cent of them coming from women\n\nFrom what he could tell many of the job hunters were millennials (aged between 23 and 37), with the majority being women from Australia, followed by the United States, UK, Italy, South America and Asia\n\nWhat did he want? * A down to earth person that wants the job to learn and not so much for the lifestyle. * This isn't a 9-5 job. I am not looking for someone who wants regular office hours. The role involves a lot of travelling and therefore normal office hours don't really apply. However, there are the perks of days off in amazing countries. * Great at thinking on their feet while on the go. Often days when we are travelling require lots of tasks to be done at once - from confirming travel arrangements to finalising coaching meetings that I have with my clients via Skype - life on the road never stops.\n\nIn April Mr Lepre told FEMAIL he had received thousands of interested emails from potential employees, with 75 per cent of them coming from women.\n\nFrom what he could tell many of the job hunters were millennials (aged between 23 and 37), with the majority being women from Australia, followed by the United States, UK, Italy, South America and Asia.\n\n'A lot of people who are applying say in their application that they are working the 9-5 rat race and want to escape corporate life and are ready to bring the skills they have learnt to this role, while travelling the world with me,' he said.\n\nWhen the job title was first announced earlier this year Mr Lepre explained how the $52,000 salary his personal assistant would receive was just the beginning.\n\n'A lot of people who are applying say in their application that they are working the 9-5 rat race and want to escape corporate life and are ready to bring the skills they have learnt to this role, while travelling the world with me,' he said\n\nWhen the job title was first announced earlier this year Mr Lepre explained how the $52,000 salary his personal assistant would receive was just the beginning\n\n'Salary will be based on the person's experience but the base rate is in addition to travel and accommodation expenses. Health insurance benefits are paid for by me separately,' he said.\n\nHe said his new employee could expect to travel to a different country every few months so they'd need a valid passport for the next year.\n\nThe opportunity would allow the lucky applicant to experience the cultures of all these places as well as help him spread the word on how it's possible to live your dream life.\n\n'Travelling while I work has allowed me to live my ideal life and I want to give someone the opportunity to do the same alongside me,' Mr Lepre said.\n\nMr Lepre is an e-commerce mastermind - who makes a cool $120,000 a month - and he says business couldn't be better\n\nOne of the benefits of running a internet-based business is your office can literally be anywhere in the world\n\nHe said the sort of person that would be perfect for the job needs to not only love travelling but be able to carry out a host of other duties.\n\n'They should be computer savvy, have proven social media capabilities, organised, willing to learn and ambitious.'\n\nHe added the sort of person he really needs by his side should be someone who is willing to step outside their comfort zone.\n\nThe businessman is proof that taking risks can pay off; at 23 he dropped out of uni because he wanted to make it on his own.\n\nHe added the sort of person he really needs by his side should be someone who is willing to step outside their comfort zone (Tyanna pictured)\n\nIn the past year, Matthew Lepre has spent his time exploring Japan, Dubai, Hawaii\n\nHis success was built on his determination to learn as much as he could from the best professionals.\n\nMr Lepre lives the life many dream about but recognises that life at the top is busy - which is why having the right person at his side is a must.\n\n'I'm looking for someone to join in all of my adventures.
