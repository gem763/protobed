But obviously they figured it out! Here are the A-listers who made their 154-person guest list:\n\nAlaia Baldwin\n\nFirst things first, Hailey was the maid of honor in her sister Alaia Baldwin's wedding, so obviously she was there to watch Hailey say her \"I do.\" Their parents, Stephen and Kennya Baldwin, were also there. (Duh.)\n\nIreland Baldwin\n\nHailey is also super close to her cousin, Ireland Baldwin, who told everyone to leave Jailey alone when people were freaking out about their marriage last year. She was there and reports said she was also a bridesmaid. Oh, and her dad is Alec Baldwin, so count him in as well.\n\nKylie Jenner and Travis Scott\n\nAccording to TMZ, Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott scored an invite, which makes sense considering Justin and Travis have collabed before and Travis and Hailey have also modeled together. Hailey and Kylie are also friends and Hailey often comments on her IG pics and says things like, \"Please stop giving me the most baby fever\" under pictures of Stormi Webster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScooter Braun\n\nBy now, we all know that Justin and his manager, Scooter Braun, are thick as thieves and will stick with each other through anything, like that whole Taylor Swift drama. Oh, Hailey also stuck by Justin's side after Scooter came under fire for buying the rights to Taylor's music. So, yeah, they've got his back, and he was def there.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Kevin Mazur/MTV1415 - Getty Images More\n\nKendall Jenner\n\nBasically, Hailey and Justin are cool with the whole Kardashian family, so you can count Kendall in, too.\n\nCarl Lentz\n\nOkay, maybe not A-lister in the traditional sense, but Pastor Carl is a big deal in the church world, and he was at the rehearsal dinner. Some fans even think he's officiating the wedding, so don't expect him to sit in the pews or anything.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "Hollywood has fully descended on South Carolina.", "authors": ["Shannon Barbour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e0sxGH.05wqmXt.ADRAaew--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/c3d00a28f2d71cedf92e95ce2540eb33", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
