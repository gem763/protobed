Or, as a recently filed federal lawsuit alleges, inaction by DCFS employees \u201cdemonstrates an inhumane indifference to A.J.\u2019s safety and shocks the conscience.\u201d\n\nAnyone can file a lawsuit, and allegations are just that.\n\nBut there have been enough details released in this case to lend considerable credence to the substance of the claims made against two veteran DCFS employees, Carlos Acosta and his supervisor, Andrew Polovin.\n\n(If they are ordered to pay a monetary judgment, taxpayers will pick up the tab.)\n\nThe two remain on the state payroll, although they have been removed from the field and put on desk duty pending an internal investigation.\n\nThe primary wrongdoers in this case are what passed for A.J.\u2019s parents, Andrew Freund and JoAnn Cunningham. They have been charged with murder and are being held in jail while awaiting trial.\n\nAuthorities alleged these chronic drug abusers subjected the child to repeated beatings, freezing showers and long hours of confinement in a locked room.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Acosta and Polovin conducted cursory inquiries into A.J.\u2019s circumstances, ignored evidence of his physical abuse and wrongfully reported that two hotline callers raised \u201cunfounded\u201d questions about the child\u2019s safety.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on behalf of the child\u2019s estate, alleges that DCFS employees violated A.J.\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nAlthough there is no disputing that DCFS mishandled this case in the worst possible way with the worst possible outcome, that\u2019s a tough legal argument to take.\n\nThe child\u2019s lawyers are alleging that state employees had a duty to protect the child, a mandate they breached and for which they can be held accountable.\n\nCourts, traditionally, have been reluctant to ascribe such duties to public employees because of the almost unlimited liability it would create for the public. Nonetheless, the facts in this case are so egregious and the indifference to the child\u2019s safety so grotesque, these allegations could pass legal muster.\n\nWhatever happens, of course, won\u2019t bring back a boy who was failed by his parents and his supposed protectors at almost every stage of his short life.\n\nA.J. was a high-profile victim of the kind of intra-family violence DCFS was put in place to guard against. But he\u2019s just one of the many child-abuse casualties who make this agency\u2019s work - simultaneously - so important and so difficult, requiring the kind of care and concern that was horrifically absent when A.J. needed it most.\n\n___\n\nOctober 20, 2019\n\nThe (Carbondale) Southern Illinoisan\n\nCoal will live on, but we must embrace other energy sources\n\nThere was a time when coal was king in Southern Illinois.\n\nPeabody Energy\u2019s Monday announcement that the Arclar Complex in Saline County faces closure is just the latest indication that the king has abdicated.\n\nThe closure will cause 225 miners at Wildcat Hills Mine and the nearby Willow Lake Production Plant, a coal processing facility, to lose their jobs. That is a severe blow to Saline County\u2019s already depressed economy.\n\nThe official closing date is Dec. 14.\n\nThe mine fact sheet provided by peabodyenergy.com states the mine generated $150 million in direct and indirect income for the region. While it\u2019s impossible to nail down an exact dollar figure coming from the mine, it\u2019s inarguable that the loss of 225 jobs will have a devastating effect on Southern Illinois as a whole.\n\nCompany officials blamed the closure on \u201cuneconomic mining conditions.\u201d\n\nAs tortured as that turn of phrase might be, it is an overdue admission of reality. Generations of Southern Illinoisans fed their families through their labors in the coal mine. It was hard, dirty, illness-inducing work, but coal miners formed the sturdy backbone of the region. For that, we are forever grateful.\n\nAs much as we may hope otherwise, the current reality suggests that will never be the case again.\n\nDespite the heated rhetoric of naysayers, renewable energy sources are gaining an ever-increasing slice of the American energy market. Yet, Southern Illinois seemingly has never completely embraced that reality because, well, we owe so much to our coal mining ancestors.\n\nNow, realize that coal mining will not completely disappear from Southern Illinois in the next generation or two. Executives of local coal companies stated last year that if current coal reserves are mined at the current rate mines can produce coal for at least another 35 to 50 years.\n\nHowever, the number of men and women employed in the mines will continue to dwindle. The causes for that decrease will be numerous - the amount of energy produced by coal will continue to diminish as solar and wind technology advances, coal mines are becoming more automated, plus it takes fewer miners to produce the same amount of coal and, finally, the cost of producing and burning coal will continue to increase.\n\nPerhaps this latest closure will provide impetus for our state and federal legislators to concentrate their efforts on drawing solar and wind production plants to Southern Illinois, or to work with the local community colleges to initiate training programs for the solar and wind industry.\n\nSoutheastern Illinois College, located a stone\u2019s throw from the Arclar Complex, seems perfect for such programs. The school sits atop a hill overlooking farmland and coal mines. The site would be perfect for solar fields and its location seems perfect for windmills.\n\nThe time is ripe. The region needs jobs and the future looks bright for wind and solar.\n\nFinally, our hearts are with and men and women who lost their jobs. There are few things more devastating for a human being than to lose your livelihood. That is especially true if you are older than age of 50.\n\nPeabody Energy has stated it will stand by its employees, but coal companies haven\u2019t always made good on those promises.\n\n\u201cThe company will work with employees at both operations to try to place those employees who are interested and in good standing in positions at other Peabody operations in the Midwest,\u201d the company said in a letter to employees. \u201cEvery effort will be extended to provide information about job opportunities with other Peabody mines.\u201d\n\nThis newspaper will keep an eye on that situation.\n\nWhile those promises are good for individual miners, it doesn\u2019t address the immediate economic loss for Southern Illinois.\n\nThe king has no fix for that problem.\n\n___\n\nOctober 18, 2019\n\nChicago Tribune\n\nHow jobs-hungry Illinois can lure more \u2018unicorns\u2019 like Rivian, the electric truck upstart\n\nIllinois doesn\u2019t see many unicorns. But there\u2019s been a sighting in downstate Normal, where an electric truck manufacturer called Rivian operates out of the former Mitsubishi auto plant.\n\nA unicorn is a privately held startup company worth at least $1 billion. Rivian\u2019s unexpected rise is worthy of comparison to the mythological creature: The company, based in Michigan, arrived in Normal several years ago with mysterious plans to develop some sort of advanced vehicle.\n\nWho were the investors? What was the business model? Rivian founder RJ Scaringe has a doctorate from MIT but he wasn\u2019t big on answering questions. He did ask for money, though, seeking property tax incentives from Normal officials, who were desperate to replace the thousands of jobs lost when Mitsubishi bailed. Normal officials took a risk and supported Rivian. \u201cI do believe they are a credible organization,\u201d Mayor Chris Koos said in late 2016.\n\nRivian eventually unveiled prototypes and confirmed its heady prospects by attracting big-league investors. This year, Amazon led a group that put $700 million into the company. Ford followed with $500 million and a plan to co-develop an electric vehicle using Rivian\u2019s platform. Then Cox Automotive provided $350 million. Rivian, which is developing an electric truck and SUV, is now worth $3.5 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. Amazon has ordered 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles.\n\nA few days ago, Rivian held an open house in Normal to show off prototypes. The company has 156 employees and isn\u2019t scheduled to roll its first electric vehicles off the line for another year. But Scaringe says, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about thousands of jobs,\u201d according to the Tribune\u2019s Robert Channick. The company\u2019s getting $4 million in local incentives plus $49.2 million in state tax credits over 15 years if it meets employment and investment targets.\n\nIt all still feels slightly unreal - yes, like a unicorn - but that\u2019s the nature of the startup field, where money chases ideas, only some of which lead to profitable, sustainable businesses. What makes the Rivian story compelling is the company\u2019s decision to locate a promising high-tech operation in a shuttered downstate factory. Mitsubishi\u2019s departure in 2015 felt like a death in the family. Here we have a rebirth.\n\nIllinois shouldn\u2019t ever be scrounging for jobs and investment. This is a manufacturing state at the crossroads of America that boasts a highly trained workforce and superb higher education options.\n\nThe challenge in attracting businesses to Illinois is the state\u2019s reputation for an unfriendly business environment: high taxes, lots of regulatory red tape and a crushing government debt load scare away investors. Foreign vehicles companies and suppliers would rather locate in places like Indiana, a fiscally sound, right-to-work state.\n\nMitsubishi left Illinois because its business was ailing, but Indiana is home to Toyota, Subaru and Honda.\n\nNow here comes Rivian. The sooner Illinois makes itself more attractive to other employers, the more success the state will have creating jobs, and luring unicorns.\n\n___\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "October 21, 2019", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
