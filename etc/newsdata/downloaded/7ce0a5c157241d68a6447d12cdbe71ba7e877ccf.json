Yusaku Maezawa poses for a photo with his successor Kotaro Sawada and Yahoo Japan CEO Kentaro Kawabe during a news conference in Tokyo, Japan September 12, 2019. Kyodo/via REUTERS\n\nZozo\u2019s billionaire founder Yusaku Maezawa said he will step down as chief executive and sell most of his stake after a series of missteps which have slashed its market value by more than half from a peak last year of $14 billion.\n\nThe deal offers Yahoo Japan a chance to take the lead in Japan\u2019s 1.8 trillion yen online fashion space where Amazon and Rakuten Inc (4755.T) have struggled to make headway, and where Zozo\u2019s mall Zozotown controls around 50% of the market for mid- to high-end fashion.\n\nIt comes as investors have grown increasingly wary about growth prospects for Zozo - a more affordable, Japan-focused version of Britain\u2019s Farfetch Ltd (FTCH.N) - after a failed experiment with bespoke tailoring and clashes with brands over discounting.\n\n\u201cMy style may have been too top-down... It was the right time for a new CEO,\u201d Maezawa, a former punk band member, told a news conference, in which he began crying as he thanked shareholders and employees.\n\nYahoo Japan\u2019s offer of 2,620 yen per Zozo share represents a premium of around 21% versus Wednesday\u2019s closing price, but is 44% lower than its peak around a year ago. Zozo\u2019s stock ended up 13% on Thursday, while Yahoo Japan shares rose 2%.\n\nThe deal also comes at a time of change in Japanese tech, where Rakuten is launching wireless telecom services in a direct challenge to SoftBank Group Corp\u2019s (9984.T) cash-cow business and Amazon has embarked on an aggressive push into fashion.\n\nYahoo Japan, which will next month change its name to Z Holdings Corp, is a unit of SoftBank controlled by the investment conglomerate\u2019s telecoms unit SoftBank Corp (9434.T).\n\nWINDFALL\n\nFor Maezawa, it would bring a windfall of around $2.3 billion. He said he will sell a stake of around 30%, leaving him with about 6% in the company.\n\nThe entrepreneur is credited with creating a trendy, user-friendly website over a decade ago at a time of scepticism about whether Japanese consumers would buy clothes online. The site, whose early stores included A Bathing Ape, Hysteric Glamour and United Arrows Ltd (7606.T), still has few rivals.\n\nIn recent years, it is Maezawa\u2019s lifestyle that has attracted attention. Maezawa signed up as the first private passenger to be taken around the moon by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, and paid $110 million for a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting.\n\nHowever, fortunes have turned for Zozo and Maezawa, with the businessman selling part of his extensive art collection at Sotheby\u2019s, saying he has no money.\n\nZozo booked its first annual earnings decline in the last financial year, due mainly to a failed made-to-measure service. It distributed skin-tight bodysuits to allow consumers to upload measurements, but ended up with few orders and huge costs.\n\nZozo has also been hit by the departure of several brands, some unhappy with its discounting policies and others wanting to create their own e-commerce services. In March, it said it secured a 15 billion yen commitment line from banks.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nDressed in a white t-shirt emblazoned with the phrase \u201cLet\u2019s Start Today\u201d at the conference, Maezawa contrasted markedly with newly-appointed CEO Kotaro Sawada, who was dressed in a suit and tie and read his remarks from a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cYou may say I\u2019m the direct opposite of Maezawa, and you\u2019d be right,\u201d Sawada said, promising to keep the company interesting but bringing much-needed stability to management.\n\nThe deal comes at a turbulent time for Yahoo Japan, which recently ousted the chief executive of another investment, retailer Askul Corp (2678.T), over lacklustre results. Askul has requested Yahoo Japan dissolve its capital ties.", "description": "Yahoo Japan Corp <4689.T> said it will take over Japan's biggest online fashion retailer Zozo Inc <3092.T> for 400 billion yen ($3.7 billion), seeking to breathe fresh life into the business and compete better against the likes of Amazon.com .", "authors": ["Ritsuko Ando", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429039319&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0U4", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
