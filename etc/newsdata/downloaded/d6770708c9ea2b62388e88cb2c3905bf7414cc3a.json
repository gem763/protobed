Cook believed alcohol was to blame for social problems, and organized a special train to carry temperance supporters to a meeting 12 miles away, according to the Thomas Cook website.\n\nRelated content Thomas Cook collapses, leaving thousands of travelers stranded\n\nIn the following years, Cook continued to arrange railway trips for temperance societies and Sunday schools until the summer of 1845, when he organized his first commercial venture -- a trip to Liverpool.\n\nHe eventually moved beyond the UK into Europe and then further afield.
