The serial rapist and murderer was killed when he exploded his suicide vest after being unable to escape. The blast also killed his three children.\n\nNo U.S. service member was killed during the raid, but a military working dog was slightly injured in the blast. The dog made a quick recovery and was able to return to active duty.\n\nTrump declassified a photo of the dog in a tweet on Monday.\n\nWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi! pic.twitter.com/PDMx9nZWvw \u2014 Donald J.

The compound had been cleared by this time with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. Eleven young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured,\" Trump said in his announcement of al-Baghdadi's death. \"The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast.\"", "description": ".10/29/2019 11:00:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/290/df7ae3db-3687-4446-98db-4c49a40bcd8e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
