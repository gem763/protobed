But throughout this period, Ireland's rugby team continued to play under a single flag.\n\nIn 1998 the Good Friday Agreement helped bring peace to Northern Ireland. It was also around that time 21 years ago that Rory Best first pulled on an Ulster jersey.\n\nHe was a schoolboy back then, sporting rather more hair than he does today, but unchanging throughout Best's long rugby career has been the jerseys he wears on game days -- the white and red of Ulster, the provincial side based in the Northern Irish capital of Belfast, and the green of Ireland.\n\nBest, who will officially retire from rugby after captaining Ireland at the upcoming Rugby World Cup in Japan, played his final game for Ulster in May this year, ending an affiliation that's endured for over half his life.\n\nA post shared by Rory Best (@rorybest2) on May 19, 2019 at 3:35am PDT\n\nSaying goodbye was even harder than he anticipated.\n\n\"When actually the words came out of my mouth, I struggled a little bit because it has been such a big part of my life for so long,\" Best tells CNN World Rugby, reflecting on the media conference when he tearfully announced his retirement.\n\nThe notion of one-club loyalty may seem old fashioned in the current era of professional sport, but at Ulster it beats as strongly as ever.\n\nThe club is deeply embedded in the fabric of Belfast; boys growing up in and around the city dream of playing for Ulster, and players who step out on the turf of the Kingspan Stadium often do so for long swathes of their career.\n\nBest's teammate Darren Cave also retired at the end of last season having spent his whole career at Ulster. Alongside Andrew Trimble, he's the club's most-capped player with 229 appearances.\n\n\"I'm probably a little biased but from a sporting point of view, it's the biggest show in town,\" Cave tells CNN World Rugby.\n\n\"It's not like in England where you've got Premier League football and all that kind of stuff. Over here, this is the biggest professional sport there is in this country.\"\n\nBut it's not just in Belfast that rugby is held in such high esteem. Throughout a country so often association with division -- religious, political, and geographical -- the sport has proved a unifying force in Ireland.\n\nJUST WATCHED Blyde and Best on World Rugby Awards Replay More Videos ...

In 1987 members of the Irish team were caught in a bombing incident while traveling across the border to national team training in Dublin. While captain David Irwin escaped unscathed, his teammate Nigel Carr missed the World Cup with the injuries he sustained.\n\n\"It's a bit taken for granted for modern rugby players because thankfully we live in a time of peace,\" says Best.\n\n\"Back then it wasn't, but rugby meant so much to them that they still went, 'Nothing's going to stop me representing Ulster, nothing's going to stop me representing Ireland.'\"\n\nRugby has transcended Ireland's divisions: \"You just want the best players,\" Best continues. \"You don't care where they come from. And when you get the best players, you want them to give their all on the pitch.\n\n\"I think that is the wonderful thing about sport and obviously rugby with the all-Ireland team. But also with Ulster crossing the border as well. It's a really lovely aspect of sport that it doesn't matter.\"\n\nRory Best retired from Ulster at the end of the 2018-19 season.\n\nAnthem changes\n\nOf the nine counties in the province of Ulster, six are north of the border and three are south of it. That means a player like Tommy Bowe, who heralds from County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland, can become a local rugby hero in the north. He played for Ulster more than 150 times.\n\nCave, who represented Ireland 11 times, was born and raised in Belfast during the 1990s. While his parents studied at the city's university during The Troubles, he has only ever known Northern Ireland on largely peaceful terms.\n\n\"I never thought it was strange that somebody from Belfast or Northern Ireland would want to play for Ireland,\" says Cave.\n\n\"People can walk around and hand on heart say they're British but at the same time, go down to Lansdowne Road or the Aviva Stadium on a Saturday and cheer for Ireland.\"\n\nPhotos: RWC 2019 venues New Zealand beat Australia 34-17 to win its second straight Rugby World Cup at Twickenham Stadium, London in October 2015.

Whereas now we're going in to a period where we don't really know what the future is going to hold.\"\n\nThe border of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is currently open. Over a million vehicles a month pass between the two countries and the open border also facilitates trade between Britain and Ireland.\n\nJUST WATCHED The 9/11 hero whose legacy lives on through rugby Replay More Videos ...

Working on the farm figures in his plans after rugby, but when it comes to Brexit there are \"so many gaps in terms of the subsidies that need to be filled,\" he says.\n\nThen there's also the impact on the sport he's leaving behind: \"Is it just going to be, well the Irish team can stay as it is? Or is it going to be, well actually you know there's bits and pieces about freedom of movement and trade across the border that just leaves it untenable to do that?\n\n\"Then what happens to Ulster? Do Ulster have to break from the three other provinces? ... I know that politicians in Brussels probably don't really care very much about Ulster Rugby or Irish Rugby, but you would like to think that there'll be consideration given to the human element of it all.\"\n\nA spokesperson told CNN that the Irish Rugby Football Union \"like all organizations, has been looking at the possible impact Brexit might have\" but \"does not wish to engage in speculation on the possible outcomes and their potential impact.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Rugby in Japan: Cherry blossoms rise up Replay More Videos ...

As the World Cup gets underway and club players across Europe begin the new season, he says he won't be having too many regrets about his decision.\n\n\"I always remember hearing the phrase, 'Everybody wants to eat sausage but no one wants to see how it's made,'\" he says.\n\n\"So I'll miss the games, but I won't miss the buildup. I won't miss the worrying about selection, the injuries, the gym, the conditioning ... the physicality. Just what your body has to go through.\"\n\nAs for Best, there's the small matter of a World Cup to play in. Ireland has never won rugby's showpiece event, but goes into the tournament as the world's top-ranked team.\n\nFew would see the men in green as outright favorites to win in Japan, but this could be the team's best ever chance to become world champion.\n\nHow can Ireland achieve that? Best thinks the answer is quite simple.\n\n\"The first World Cup I went to, it wasn't an enjoyable experience because we went there thinking we were going to do well and we actually forgot to enjoy the fact that we're in a World Cup.\n\n\"I think that is the big thing -- how we get players and whatever management to enjoy the experience and ultimately deliver the best that they can deliver.\"", "description": "During a period of social and political turmoil, the sport of rugby saw Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland put differences aside.", "authors": ["George Ramsay", "Christina Macfarlane"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190627162256-ireland-rugby-huddle-new-zealand-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
