The president turned that into a laugh line at the expense of a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts who ended his bid for the presidency on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Dow is down 573 points perhaps on the news that Representative Seth Moulton, whoever that may be, has dropped out of the 2020 Presidential Race!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. (The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day 623 points down.)\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tweets caught most of his advisers and staff by surprise. His advisers have grown concerned that he is creeping perilously close to turning what they had hoped would be his signature issue into a liability. His moves risk scaring away voters, including some of his own backers.\n\nHis aides believe Mr. Trump is being urged on by Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, his trade advisers, who generally share the president\u2019s hostile view of China and who advocated a confrontational path with tariffs. Some said they have filled a void left by Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, who has not weighed in forcefully.", "description": "Mr. Trump\u2019s wild pronouncements on Friday renewed questions about his stewardship of the world\u2019s largest economy even as he escalated a trade war with China before heading to France for the G7 summit.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/23/us/politics/23dc-trump/23dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
