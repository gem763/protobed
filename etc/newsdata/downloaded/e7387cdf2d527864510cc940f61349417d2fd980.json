At the heart of the pushback are concerns about Facebook's huge user base and how it has managed its social network.\n\nAmong the issues Waters highlighted: failure to improve diversity in Facebook's leadership ranks; enabling housing discrimination through its ad platform; infringing on users' privacy; and facilitating foreign election interference.\n\nWaters also hammered Zuckerberg over the company\u2019s policy to exempt political ads from fact-checking, saying it could allow candidates to wage unchecked campaigns to discourage voting.\n\nShe said the impact of the policy \u2014 which has come under heavy scrutiny in Washington since its unveiling in August \u2014 \u201cwill be a massive voter suppression effort that will move at the speed of a click.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic lawmaker cited the policy in swiping at Zuckerberg\u2019s recent high-profile speech in which he sought to reaffirm Facebook\u2019s commitment to freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cYour claim to promote freedom of speech does not ring true,\u201d Waters told Zuckerberg, the sole witness testifying.\n\nZuckerberg \u2014 appearing on Capitol Hill for the first time since last April \u2014 stood by the company\u2019s stance, arguing that Facebook only derives a small share of its profits from political ads and that the decision to keep up misleading political ads is a matter of principle.\n\n\u201cThis really is not about money,\u201d he said. \u201cOn principle, I believe in giving people a voice. I believe that ads can be an important part of voice.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been besieged by controversy over its decision to host a misleading political attack at by the Trump campaign targeting Joe Biden. The former vice president and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), among other 2020 presidential contenders, have blasted the company over the move.\n\nBut the main focus of the hearing was Facebook's Libra project, which the company is trying to launch with other partners under the auspices of the Switzerland-based Libra Association. The effort suffered a big blow earlier this month when major financial institutions and tech companies including Visa, MasterCard and eBay walked back initial commitments to join the association.\n\nZuckerberg told lawmakers today that he believed the early partners distanced themselves from Libra \"because it's a risky project and there's been a lot of scrutiny.\"\n\n\"I actually don't know if Libra's gonna work,\" he said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/83/ab/fcad738a4efc82de0d667aa3677a/191023-waters-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
