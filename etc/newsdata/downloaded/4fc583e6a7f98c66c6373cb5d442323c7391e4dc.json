She was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe suspect opened fire outside the house at 3.30pm, blasting seven shots through the door and windows, in what seemed like a targeted attack, according to reports.\n\nPolice said that the gunman fired at least seven shots through the door and window of a home on the 3300 block of North Water Street in Philadelphia (pictured) at 3.31pm Sunday\n\n'No child should be murdered in their living room. It\u2019s just terrible,' Philadelphia\u2019s acting police commissioner, Christine Coulter, told the Inquirer.\n\n'The wanton gun violence, the disregard for people\u2019s lives or safety. To shoot into an occupied house is something I can\u2019t comprehend.'\n\nThe gunman also struck the child's 24-year-old mother with stray bullets in the head and the back. She was in a critical but stable condition on Sunday evening.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s acting police commissioner, Christine Coulter (pictured), said that she couldn't understand the gunman's 'disregard for people's lives or safety'\n\nStock image of Philadelphia police. The news of the toddler's death comes just hours after an 11-month old baby boy was shot four times when a gunman opened fire on the car he was travelling, riddling it with bullets. Despite some of them hitting him in the head and chest, he is now in a stable condition in hospital\n\nA contractor, who was working in the house, was hit in the stomach and is in critical condition.\n\n'It\u2019s heartbreaking,' Coulter told the paper.\n\n'Any crime, anybody shot is a horrible thing, but when people indiscriminately shoot and kill babies \u2014 it\u2019s unexplainable. I can\u2019t imagine.'\n\nThe news of the toddler's death comes just hours after an 11-month old baby boy was shot four times, including in the head and chest, when a gunman shot at the car he was sitting in.\n\nHe was rushed to hospital and listed as critical but in a stable condition on Sunday.\n\nThe girl was the 278th person to be killed in Philadelphia this year.", "description": "A toddler was killed inside her Philadelphia home on Sunday just hours after an 11-month old boy survived being shot with four bullets.
