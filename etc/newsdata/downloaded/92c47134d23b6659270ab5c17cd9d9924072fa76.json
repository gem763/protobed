There is no margin for error.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Tanna has repeatedly warned that EnergyAustralia may be forced to shut its Yallourn coal generator in Victoria early if it becomes unprofitable due to the hollowing out of daytime power prices by ample renewable energy.\n\nWhile Origin's Eraring coal plant, the country's largest generator, is more able to respond to the fluctuating market, Mr Calabria also said that market conditions could force it also to close earlier than the \"base case\" of 2032.\n\nHe argued that firm, unchanging rules would drive the needed investment in new firm capacity, pointing to the surge in new wind and solar plants as a result of the 2020 Renewable Energy Target.\n\nBut such investments have been scarce since Origin's Mortlake plant in Victoria in 2011 and AGL Energy's commitment to build its Barker Inlet plant in South Australia, which is replacing a retiring gas plant.\n\nMr Calabria said that in today's market, the government's Underwriting New Generation Investments (UNGI) scheme was the only thing that would drive investment in new on-demand power.\n\n\"But in the longer term, you've got to let the market do that and I don't see beyond those existing measures what it is that is giving confidence that we would invest further. Ultimately, we need to integrate an emissions reduction over time into the sector.\"\n\nGovernment intervention warranted\n\nThe federal government in August 2017 abandoned its National Energy Guarantee policy that would have set long-term goals for emissions reduction tied to an obligation to guarantee supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat came after the failure of several iterations of integrated climate and energy policy including the Clean Energy Target.\n\nInstead, Mr Taylor has overseen the introduction of an underwriting scheme for new on-demand power, the partial re-regulation of retail electricity prices, and advanced the government-owned Snowy 2.0 storage project, and is now threatening forced asset divestments.\n\nWhile the government has also introduced an obligation for retailers to guarantee reliable power, that measure has not been triggered after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) calculated that set reliability standards weren't likely to be breached.\n\nDr Schott said she was surprised the retailer obligation had not been triggered. But Mr Calabria said he wasn't convinced that it would in any case provide the signal for investment in new firm generation.\n\nMr Taylor argued that government intervention in the market was fully warranted because of the dire state of the market, evident from surging power bills as renewable power increased.\n\n\"In an ideal world, policymakers should design the market to focus on the needs of customers, and then let the market rip without any further changes,\" Mr Taylor told the Summit.\n\n\"But the extraordinary distortions we've seen in recent years need to be addressed with some urgency.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAEMO head Audrey Zibelman, who is responsible for keeping the lights on in the NEM Market, said intervention wasn't surprising if reliability was at stake.\n\n\"Governments cannot handle \u2013 because people can't handle \u2013 a power system that is uneconomic or not delivering reliability. \"I understand that ... No-one relishes intervening, we don't relish intervening, but we're not going to allow the system to go dark and so we need to get on with it.\"\n\nBut Ms Zibelman said government or regulatory intervention was not a long-term solution to encourage investment.\n\n\"I think we all agree innovation and markets are going to be much better than governments in both taking on the risk and making the right kinds of investments,\" she said.\n\nMs Zibelman also called for a long-term replacement for the Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader, saying the current system to find emergency supply each summer was not desirable and expensive.\n\n\"It's not feasible, it's dangerous and it's expensive,\" she said.\n\nSituation abnormal\n\nMerryn York of the Australian Energy Market Commission, the industry's rulemaker, pointed to all the different factors coming into play in the questions around new generation,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It is not actually happening despite there being signals that in normal circumstances would have driven investment,\" she said, pointing to \"high forward contract prices\" that in previous years would have been expected to have driven investment.\n\nDr Schott noted it was crucial that Australia didn't over-invest and over-build, however, as the country put in place a more modern electricity grid, because that would result in higher power bills for customers.\n\n\"The investment in all of these things will find their way onto customers' bills,'' Dr Schott said, while adding it was \"quite an urgent issue\" to get the transmission issue right.\n\n\"We've got a grid at the moment that's not fit for purpose,'' she said.\n\nPart of the problem was that large renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines were in rural areas and there was a ''long, skinny string'' to connect those into metropolitan areas where the large populations resided.\n\n\"That is really plaguing us at the moment''.\n\nHigher electricity bills were one of the original reasons why many households decided to install solar panels, resulting in some cities in Australia having the highest penetration of rooftop solar in the world.", "description": "The stalemate between government and business is stopping vital investment in new gas and pumped hydro that can smooth out intermittent wind and solar power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3271%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_179%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/752ff5a2f1450d9faae623e9192ef149528c32f8", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
