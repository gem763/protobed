Investing.com - U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed to win support for an early general election as MPs voted against his proposal for a Dec. 12 election. The government received 299 votes, well short of the 434 needed. Ahead of the vote, the DUP, which props up Johnson's government, said they would not be voting with the government. The vote comes just hours after EU leaders offered to delay Brexit until Jan. 31, and also gave the U.K. the option to leave early if they pass the Withdrawal Agreement. Johnson confirmed in a letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk that the U.K. had formally accepted the extension offer. It is the second defeat in less than a week for Price Minister Johnson after MPs last week thwarted his attempt to fast-track the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through parliament. rose 0.34% to $1.2865.\n\nNewsBreak: U.K. PM Johnson Fails to Win Support for Dec. 12 Election", "description": "NewsBreak: U.K. PM Johnson Fails to Win Support for Dec. 12 Election", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC6H0BP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
