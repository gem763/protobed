It came with seven dominant innings from Strasburg. It came with an offense that started and didn\u2019t stop, not for any Cardinals pitcher, until it had scored eight runs between the third and the seventh. And it came, in the end, with a promise: Take one more game from the Cardinals, just one in four tries, and go straight to the World Series. Only one team in history, the 2004 New York Yankees, had a 3-0 lead in a seven-game series and didn\u2019t win.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis was, at the start, the ballpark\u2019s first chance to host the National League Championship Series. A cool autumn day turned into a crisp autumn evening. News vans dotted the pavement around the park. Fans poured in off South Capitol Street, and Half Street, and every street leading here like a treasure map, finally solved, for a city to use as a guide to hoping in October. Their shirts and hats were a matching red. Their heads allowed the possibilities.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because the Nationals, their team, have been on a tear since Sept. 23. They won eight straight games to close the regular season. They have won 15 of their past 17, with just two losses to the Los Angeles Dodgers, whom they would eventually upset in the NL Division Series. The Nationals have now directly eliminated the Philadelphia Phillies, Cleveland Indians, Milwaukee Brewers and Dodgers from postseason contention or the postseason itself. They have gone from fringe contenders to a full-on buzz saw.\n\nSo, yeah, Monday was different.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnly Cardinals starter Jack Flaherty stood between Washington rolling and slowing down. The 23-year-old had an MLB-best 0.91 ERA in the second half. He attacks with a high-90s fastball and two breaking balls. But he was opposing Strasburg, who entered with a 1.32 ERA in 34 career postseason innings and who has paced the Nationals throughout their run. Flaherty\u2019s margin for error was minuscule when his outing began. Soon Strasburg made it disappear.\n\nStrasburg didn\u2019t tease at a no-hitter like the two Nationals starters before him. The Cardinals\u2019 first knock, a Marcell Ozuna double, came with no outs in the second. But Strasburg caught Ozuna in a rundown, sprinting to tag him between second and third, and soon sunk into a groove. Flaherty was sharp early on. He even flashed his shutdown stuff. Minor mistakes, though, were enough for the Nationals to run away. Flaherty yielded a leadoff single to Victor Robles in the third. Robles, in his first start since straining his hamstring Oct. 4, moved to second on Strasburg\u2019s sacrifice bunt.\n\nAdam Eaton soon bounced a two-out single through the middle. Robles raced home and, with that, the fans jumped into a familiar routine: Nationals score. They scream. Then they waited to do it again, like a bag of popping kernels, until Rendon and Howie Kendrick delivered. Rendon spoiled a two-strike slider and one-handed it into shallow left. Ozuna couldn\u2019t make a sliding catch, knocking the ball into foul territory, and Eaton sped in from first. Another scream. Juan Soto walked to extend the rally. Kendrick made the Cardinals pay for the mistake, whacking a two-run double to the wall into the right-center field gap, and that triggered the loudest scream yet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFlaherty had not allowed four runs in a game since July 2. He had not allowed four runs in the same inning since June 25. Now he had done both, in the span of a blink, and the Cardinals stared straight up a mountain. They had one run on five hits to that point of the series. They had to break through against Strasburg, a near-impossible task, and they couldn\u2019t. The Nationals scored twice more in the fifth on back-to-back RBI doubles from Kendrick and Ryan Zimmerman. They added another run in the sixth on Robles\u2019s solo shot.\n\nThe Cardinals got one back in the seventh, thanks to a Soto error in left, but Strasburg gritted out a strong finish. He put the Cardinals down with two final strikeouts, each with his change-up, and collected 12 total. All of them came on off-speed pitches. Nationals starters had then thrown 212/3 innings in the NLCS without allowing an earned run. Strasburg\u2019s teammates wrapped him in a group hug in the dugout. He smiled while sandwiched in a group of arms.\n\nThe Nationals scored another run in the next half-inning to erase any damage. They spent the night revving this town into delirium, suppressed by so many hollow years, and have spent three weeks checking teams off a lengthening list. Just ask the Phillies, Indians, Brewers and Dodgers how it feels. The Cardinals could be next.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo could a World Series berth.\n\nRead more:\n\nInning-by-inning recap\n\nby Sam Fortier\n\nNinth inning (Nationals 8, Cardinals 1)\n\nTanner Rainey locked down the save and delivered the Nationals a 3-0 lead in the NLCS.\n\nAD\n\nEighth inning (Nationals 8, Cardinals 1)\n\nFernando Rodney usually only does the bow-and-arrow after saves. He likely won\u2019t get any saves this postseason, so he made a special exception for a 1-2-3 eighth inning that included a pair of strikeouts. See ya.\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals did nothing with a two-out walk from Trea Turner. No matter. They have Tanner Rainey coming in to protect a seven-run lead in the ninth. The Nationals are three outs away from a commanding 3-0 lead in this NLCS.\n\nSeventh inning (Nationals 8, Cardinals 1)\n\nIf the Cardinals had nine of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez, maybe this series would be different. Mart\u00ednez didn\u2019t start the first two games \u2014 he\u2019s a poor fielder \u2014 but finally, down 2-0 in the series, Cardinals Manager Mike Shildt decided enough was enough and started his best hitter. He singled off Strasburg to leadoff the inning and later scored on a bizarre play by Juan Soto. The left fielder fielded a Paul DeJong line drive and, while he kept it in front of him, he slipped making a throw and, after he recovered and rifled a bullet in, the throw went wide and Mart\u00ednez sprinted home for the Cardinals\u2019 first run.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStrasburg escaped the inning with limited damage after that. He had a runner at first and second with one out and responded by striking out his old catcher, Matt Wieters, and then Dexter Fowler for the third time. He did not chirp at home-plate umpire Bill Miller running off the field. He let the cheers from Nationals Park do all the talking he needed.\n\nSTEPHEN STRASBURG STRIKES OUT THE SIDE IN THE 7TH!\n\n\n\nHe's matched his #Postseason career high with 12 on the night.#Strasmas // #STAYINTHEFIGHT pic.twitter.com/b07ofFXKL2 \u2014 Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 15, 2019\n\nNationals starters have pitched 21 2/3 innings in this series and not allowed an earned run. \u2014 Jesse Dougherty (@dougherty_jesse) October 15, 2019\n\n#Nationals starters so far in this series have thrown 21 2/3 innings.\n\n\n\nThey have walked three #Cardinals.\n\n\n\nThree.\n\n\n\nStrasburg didn't walk one tonight. That's a stinging indictment of the #stlcards offense. \u2014 Derrick S. Goold (@dgoold) October 15, 2019\n\nStephen Strasburg's 1.10 ERA is the 3rd-lowest in #postseason history (min. 6 starts).\n\n\n\nHe trails only Sandy Koufax (0.95) and Christy Mathewson (1.06). pic.twitter.com/cZ5uRHqhwB \u2014 MLB Stats (@MLBStats) October 15, 2019\n\nThe Nationals got that run back. Ryan Zimmerman and Howie Kendrick, 35 and 36, respectively, have been the most productive one-two punch in the Nationals lineup. They\u2019re 5-for-8 with four doubles and four RBI \u2014 about as prolific as the rest of the lineup combined. This is why Dave Martinez felt strongly about not changing his right side of the infield when he felt them going good.\n\n\"We old guys can still play.\"\n\n\n\n- Howie Kendrick after Game 1\n\n\n\n5-for-8, 4 2B, 5 RBI\n\n\n\n- Howie Kendrick and Ryan Zimmerman so far in Game 3#NLCS // #STAYINTHEFIGHT pic.twitter.com/4y1wbst6xD \u2014 Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 15, 2019\n\nSixth inning (Nationals 7, Cardinals 0)\n\nAD\n\nStephen Strasburg flat dominated the Cardinals in the sixth, striking out Paul Goldschmidt on three pitches and Marcell Ozuna on four. He dispatched the heart of the Cardinals and jogged back to the dugout as if this superlative performance in front of a raucous Nationals Park was easy.\n\nAD\n\nOh and if you had the Nationals\u2019 only two home runs of the NLCS coming from their center fielders (Michael A. Taylor and Victor Robles), buy a lottery ticket right now. This is Robles\u2019s first game back from injury, by the way, and he blasted an opposite-field homer in the sixth.\n\nFifth inning (Nationals 6, Cardinals 0)\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter who the Cardinals sent to the plate, Stephen Strasburg blew them away. He struck out Tommy Edman to start the inning, allowed a single to Paul DeJong but, when the Cardinals pinch-hit Matt Carpenter for Jack Flaherty \u2014 ending their ace\u2019s night at four innings, four runs allowed \u2014 he blew Carpenter away too. The left-handed hitter watched a curveball drop in and headed straight to the dugout. Dexter Fowler flied out to end the inning and Strasburg, not done mowing down opponents, jawed with home-plate umpire Bill Miller as he walked off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo of the Nationals oldest players, 35-year-old Ryan Zimmerman and 36-year-old Howie Kendrick, smacked two-out doubles to expand the Nationals\u2019 lead to 6-0 \u2014 as many runs as had been scored all series. Kendrick\u2019s case for NLCS MVP is almost as strong as Adam Eaton\u2019s, and for the Nationals, it\u2019s a good problem to have.\n\nHowie Kendrick has the most RBI (9) in a single #postseason for a player over 36 since David Ortiz (13) and Carlos Beltran (15) both did so in 2013 ...\n\n\n\nand Howie isn't done with October yet. pic.twitter.com/vPmIPPrALC \u2014 MLB Stats (@MLBStats) October 15, 2019\n\nFourth inning (Nationals 4, Cardinals 0)\n\nThe Cardinals mounted a mini-rally with two two-out singles, but Stephen Strasburg quickly dispatched it. He got Yadier Molina to fly out to center and he trudged back to the dugout having hurled four scoreless at 66 pitches.\n\nThe Nationals squandered a leadoff single by Kurt Suzuki \u2014 the catcher\u2019s first postseason hit in 18 at-bats \u2014 but it hardly felt like a big deal. The Nationals have already scored the most runs anyone has in one game this series (four) against the Cardinals ace who was supposed to be a stopper (Jack Flaherty). The Nationals boosted his pitch count to 78 and with his spot in the lineup due up in the fifth, might force him from the game.\n\nThird inning (Nationals 4, Cardinals 0)\n\nAnthony Rendon made the probable play of the night when he robbed the Cardinals of their second hit. Paul DeJong hit a rocket off Stephen Strasburg and Rendon, ranging to his left, dove to snag the ball as it went behind him. He scrambled to his feet and fired to first in time. Nationals Park got on its feet for the play and Rendon showed zero emotion. He spit sunflower seeds like he was sitting in the backyard on a lazy summer day.\n\nA 102.9 MPH bullet off the bat?!\n\n\n\nNo problem for Anthony Rendon. pic.twitter.com/yphuJVpGlx \u2014 MLB Stats (@MLBStats) October 15, 2019\n\nAdam Eaton just furthered his candidacy for NLCS MVP. His run-scoring single off Jack Flaherty in the third gave him three RBI in three games and plated the Nationals first run of the night \u2014 Victor Robles, who fought back from 0-2 to single up the middle against one of baseball\u2019s best pitchers in his first real at-bat in 10 days. Not bad. The Nationals have scored the first run in each of the three NLCS games so far.\n\nMarcell Ozuna has had a tough night. He got caught between second and third in the second then dropped a tough catch (and made a poor throw home) in the third. Anthony Rendon\u2019s double scored Eaton all the way from first.\n\nHowie Kendrick drilled a two-run double to right-center off Flaherty and confirmed, indisputably, that the Nationals are currently a buzz-saw. The Nationals have as many hits in the third inning of Game 3 as the Cardinals had in Games 1 and 2 combined (four).\n\nSecond inning (Nationals 0, Cardinals 0)\n\nStephen Strasburg allowed a leadoff double to Marcell Ozuna, but he got out of it in a way any high school baseball coach would appreciate. He got a groundball from the next batter, Jose Martinez, and turned to catch Ozuna between the bases. He made a fundamental play by running directly at Ozuna, who froze and ran neither toward third or back to second. Strasburg tagged out Ozuna, got pop-outs from the next two hitters and headed back to the dugout at 29 pitches.\n\nBill Miller\u2019s strike zone became an issue right away in the second when he punched out Howie Kendrick on this down-and-in two-seamer from Jack Flaherty. But now that the book is out there on the umpire, it\u2019s up to the hitters to adjust.\n\nThat down-and-in two-seamer is what Bill Miller called for strike three. It aggravated Howie Kendrick. Book is out there, hitters gotta adjust. pic.twitter.com/YmQ6SeQ0UM \u2014 Sam Fortier (@Sam4TR) October 15, 2019\n\nFirst inning (Nationals 0, Cardinals 0)\n\nStephen Strasburg matched Nationals Park\u2019s electricity in the first, striking out the first and last batter in a 1-2-3 inning. The right-hander did it on just 10 pitches and pounded the strike zone low and away, which will likely be a theme tonight with home-plate umpire Bill Miller\u2019s large zone. Nationals Park was on its feet for the last out in what promises to be a memorable first NLCS game in the District.\n\nJack Flaherty, the 23-year-old Cardinals starter who reminds those around the league of Max Scherzer, retired the Nationals in order in the first. He walked Anthony Rendon but navigated around it by coming back from 3-0 to strike out Juan Soto. The Soto Shuffle returned tonight \u2014 he stalked forward, grabbed his cup, stared down Flaherty \u2014 but none of it stopped the young right-hander from fanning him anyway.\n\nChildish Bambino even makes taking a pitch cool. pic.twitter.com/HhL3MCgaAT \u2014 MLB (@MLB) October 15, 2019\n\nPregame\n\nAn\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez got a big hand from Nationals Park. He carried a no-hitter through 7 2/3 in Game 1. Oh, to be a starter for the four days after a great outing.\n\nD.C. Washington is not from D.C., but now he embodies it. The man stood behind a microphone at home plate and delivered the first words of the first NLCS game in Nationals Park history. He hit the notes. He went up and got \u201cFor the land of the FREEEEEE\u201d and the crowd exploded.
