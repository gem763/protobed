To be clear, this alleged therapy is barbaric and inhumane, but repealing this law seemed to be the best path forward.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom had filed a federal lawsuit over ban in January on behalf of a therapist in Brooklyn, saying it violated free speech between a therapist and client.\n\nAlliance Senior Counsel Roger Brooks said that if the repeal goes through, the organization would \u201ccommend the move.\u201d\n\nHe called the law \u201creally quite extreme\u201d and pushed back against the idea that it was vulnerable only because of a more conservative Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a political issue as well-established First Amendment law,\u201d he said.\n\nA New York state ban that applies only to minors would still be in effect.\n\nThe therapy has been banned for minors in other states, as well. Brooks said there are currently challenges to some of those laws by other organizations, which he expected would continue.", "description": "Many believe a pending federal lawsuit filed by the Alliance Defending Freedom could have greater implications for LGBTQ people if the ban isn't lifted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7aca8b2400002e2a78d5a3.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
