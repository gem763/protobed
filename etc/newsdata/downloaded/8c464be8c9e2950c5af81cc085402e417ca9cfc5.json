John Bercow bows out of Brexit drama", "language": "en", "text": "LONDON \u2014 It was when Emmanuel Macron asked Boris Johnson to quieten down at the G7 summit that it became apparent John Bercow has become an international celebrity.\n\n\"Order!\" Macron said in a Gallic impersonation of the speaker of the House of Commons. \"Order, Boris!\"\n\nHaving enjoyed \u2014 for a speaker \u2014 hitherto unheard of levels of recognition thanks to his loud, long-winded, but occasionally game-changing chairing of the Commons' widely watched Brexit debates, Bercow announced on Monday he would be standing down on October 31.\n\nTo some MPs he is a hero of parliamentary democracy, to others a pompous self-promoter who has ridden roughshod over parliament's rules and allowed MPs to override the vote of the British people in the 2016 referendum.\n\nBut on his own terms, Bercow leaves on a high. As speaker \u2014 the (by convention) impartial chair of Commons proceedings \u2014 his personal mission since taking office in 2009 has been to put parliament at the center of British political decision-making after a period when, under Margaret Thatcher and then Tony Blair, it was often sidelined by powerful governments.\n\nBrexiteers accuse John Bercow not of trying to block no-deal, but to block Brexit altogether.\n\nOn Brexit, that mission has been accomplished. Rather than be steamrollered by Johnson's government into accepting that Brexit would happen, deal or no deal, on October 31, Bercow permitted opposition and rebel Conservative MPs to take control of the Commons timetable. That allowed them to bring in a fast-track law forcing a Brexit delay if no agreement is in place by mid-October.\n\n\"Throughout my time as speaker I have sought to increase the relative authority of this legislature,\" Bercow told MPs in his resignation statement, before booming: \"For which I will make absolutely no apology. To anyone. Anywhere. At any time.\"\n\nHis successor \u2014 who will be chosen in a secret ballot of MPs \u2014 will likely have to shepherd the House of Commons through further Brexit storms, unless Johnson defies expectations and strikes a deal with the EU in the next few weeks. They will also have to continue to stand up for the Commons at a time when Downing Street is seeking to play up conflict between parliament and the people.\n\nMission accomplished\n\nThe resignation announcement, however, was not a total surprise.\n\nBercow once said he would serve for nine years. When that timescale came and went last year \u2014 beset by bullying allegations (which he denies) and official reports condemning a toxic working culture for Commons staff \u2014 he said privately he would go in summer 2019.\n\nBut with Brexit postponed earlier this year to October, Bercow changed tack to say he would stay on to preside over what he called \"momentous events\" in parliament.\n\nFor Brexiteers, the decision was just another example of what they see as his failure of impartiality over Brexit. He revealed two years ago that he had voted Remain in the 2016 referendum and it is through this lens that many Leave-backers \u2014 and many members of Johnson's government \u2014 have viewed Bercow's judgments on the Commons' proper role in the Brexit drama.\n\nSome observers outside parliament also view that decision as a mistake. \"He is the first speaker to have allowed his political position on a key matter to become known. He revealed that he voted Remain. This, in my view, was unconstitutional,\" leading constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor told POLITICO, \"The speaker, like the queen, is required to be politically neutral. I hope that the next speaker returns to the traditional practice.\"\n\nBercow has defied conventional procedures to allow the majority view against no deal in the House of Commons to morph into a law that binds the government to indefinite extensions of the Brexit timetable unless an agreement is in place or the Commons changes its mind.\n\nCandidates to replace Bercow include any one his deputies: Labour's Lindsay Hoyle and Rosie Winterton.\n\nTo opponents, that too was out of order. \"The Speaker hasn\u2019t just bent the rules, he has broken them,\" Business Secretary and former leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom wrote in the Mail on Sunday this week. Her article also confirmed that the Tories planned to break with convention and stand a candidate against the speaker in his Buckingham constituency, in the south of England, at the next election \u2014 another consideration that may have factored in his decision to quit.\n\nBrexiteers accuse Bercow not of trying to block no-deal, but to block Brexit altogether. The speaker himself would claim he was just doing his job. As speaker he has always taken the view that if there is a majority for something in the Commons, it is his job to make it happen.\n\n\u201cHe has talked long before Brexit about how he is not bound by precedent,\" said Seb Whale, political editor of parliament's the House magazine, who is writing a biography of Bercow. \"He sees precedent as an informant rather than an instruction ... The extent to which he is being unconstitutional is overdone. He has been consistent across his career about not feeling bound by precedent.\u201d\n\n\"What you have to know about Bercow is he grew up in quite humble beginnings and was bullied at school,\" Whale added. \"You can see that in his role as speaker he sees himself as the bastion of the backbenchers, sticking up against the bully boys in government ... He has always been in favor of the minority against the majority.\"\n\nBumptious, objectionable, exemplary\n\nThe gratitude some MPs feel for that approach was evident in tributes to Bercow on Monday. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said that backing him for speaker in 2009 may have been her \"most important vote cast for the future of our country and our parliamentary democracy.\"\n\nA Conservative who, thanks to Brexit, ended up being better liked by opposition MPs than his own side, Bercow was, according to veteran Labour MP Barry Sheerman, \"bumptious, self-opinionated, right-wing, objectionable\" when they first met. \"I could say you haven't changed, but the fact of the matter is you have been an exemplary speaker,\" Sheerman said.\n\nCandidates to replace Bercow include any one his deputies: Labour's Lindsay Hoyle and Rosie Winterton; and Conservative Eleanor Laing. Labour's Chris Bryant has long had his eye on the role, while veteran Conservative Brexiteer Edward Leigh \u2014 who in his polite tribute to Bercow on Monday also noted that at times he had been \"infuriated\" by him \u2014 has also thrown his hat into the ring.\n\nOpponents of Brexit will hope the next occupant of the speaker's chair continues in Bercow's vein. For Labour's Clive Lewis, an advocate of a second referendum on Brexit, the decision is a vital one. \"The next speaker will ... need to be a defender of the legislature in an era of populist politics and strong authoritarian politics spreading all over the world,\" he said.\n\nWhoever it is, they will have a tough act to follow. Veteran Tory MP Keith Simpson, no fan of Bercow's, acknowledged that the speaker had succeeded in one thing.\n\n\u201cHe's pissed all over Boris\u2019 parade,\" Simpson said. \u201cHe has gone under his terms, there is no doubt about that.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
