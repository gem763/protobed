This game has become even more important for us.\"\n\nSpurs now face being without Lloris for an extended period of time as they wait to discover the full extent of the damage.", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Hugo Lloris suffered a gruesome arm injury vs Brighton", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Bt Sport", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465950.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League-AMEX-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
