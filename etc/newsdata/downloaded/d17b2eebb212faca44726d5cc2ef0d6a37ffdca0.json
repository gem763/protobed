Instead, they are civil allegations of misconduct, the judge ruled.\n\n\u201cWe went to law school on that one,\u201d said David Crump, an attorney for the economic development authority\u2019s board members.\n\nThe result is that the government officials no longer face the possibility of a year in jail or a $2,500 fine, Crump said.\n\nAD\n\nBryan Layton, the county\u2019s acting commonwealth\u2019s attorney, said Tuesday he has not ruled out pursuing civil penalties under the same charges. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to look into the possibility at this point, but it\u2019s certainly still out there, and I haven\u2019t ruled it out,\u201d he said.\n\nWarren County\u2019s government will still be scrutinized in the wake of the felony indictments of McDonald, her husband, Samuel North, and several others. Among other things, McDonald is accused of using authority funds to pay off credit card debts and buy properties through a limited liability company that she created with Sheriff Daniel T. McEathron. She has said she is innocent of those charges.\n\nAD\n\nMcEathron, who was also accused of wrongdoing in a lawsuit, killed himself in May.\n\nAD\n\nLayton\u2019s office and local activists say county officials should have stepped in earlier to stop the criminal activity that allegedly began shortly after a Northern Virginia developer arrived in Front Royal in 2014 with plans to turn a portion of the former Avtex Fibers Superfund site into a data center.\n\nThe developer, Truc \u201cCurt\u201d Tran, says he was an unwitting participant in the activities. Both he and McDonald are defendants in a lawsuit filed by the authority.\n\nA recall petition seeking to remove all five of the county supervisors from office is awaiting a late November hearing.\n\nAlbertson on Monday denied a motion by Layton\u2019s office seeking to have the supervisors immediately suspended from their duties until the petition, signed by 941 residents, is heard, according to attorneys.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe effort could nonetheless hurt some of the supervisors at the ballot box in next week\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cAnybody that has been involved in local politics needs to go,\u201d said Kristie Atwood, a local activist who has helped with the recall effort.\n\nSeveral supervisors did not return messages Tuesday, while others declined to comment.\n\nDemetrios Pikrallidas, an attorney for Supervisor Thomas H. Sayre (R-Shenandoah), said his client has been unfairly maligned. \u201cHe\u2019s been put through the wringer on this for no good reason,\u201d Pikrallidas said. He added that while Sayre publicly questioned McDonald about her activity as soon as he suspected something was wrong at the authority, it was difficult for public officials to know what was happening.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking people to basically oversee everything, and that\u2019s just not possible,\u201d Pikrallidas said. \u201cThere was some smoke there, but no one really saw the fire.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "A judge ruled that misfeasance and nonfeasance are civil violations under Virginia law.", "authors": ["Antonio Olivo", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Demographics In Northern Virginia"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FCcNrRKJAQ2mhe5ov-bTPWw-SCk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GRJ2TDWWKYI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
