To do so would hand Democrats a compelling argument that Trump bumbled his way into a war, according to one of the advisers.\n\nTrump\u2019s split-screen impulses on Iran have one constant, current and former officials said. He wants to best the legacy of former president Barack Obama.\n\nUnder that umbrella, the locked-and-loaded comment on Sunday comes from a desire to confront a tough adversary with greater toughness, something he says Obama failed to do. And the invitation to Iran to negotiate comes from Trump\u2019s thinking that he can drive a harder bargain than his predecessor.\n\nTrump particularly wants to show up traditional foreign policy hands and U.S. allies who point to the 2015 nuclear deal as a signature Obama achievement, people who have discussed Iran policy with him said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Msn.Com En-Xl Northamerica Northamerica-Top-Stories Trumps-Dual-Instincts-On-Iran-Big-Threats-And-An-Eagerness-To-Deal Li Bbkxlga"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
