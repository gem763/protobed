(I-Hwa Cheng/Reuters)\n\nAn intensifying Chinese government campaign to cut off Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic partners yielded another casualty on Friday as Taipei severed relations with the Pacific nation of Kiribati, reciprocating a step by the far-flung yet strategically important island state.\n\nThe move comes as Beijing seeks to isolate the Taiwanese government of President Tsai Ing-wen, who opposes closer political integration with the mainland, ahead of presidential elections Jan. 11 on the democratically ruled island. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has refused to rule out retaking it by force.\n\nSince Tsai took power in 2016, Beijing has used its growing influence and financial inducements to steadily pick off Taiwan\u2019s dwindling list of diplomatic partners. Most recently, the Solomon Islands this week switched allegiances from Taipei to Beijing, joining El Salvador, Panama, Sao Tome and Principe, the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso.\n\n[Solomon Islands recognizes Beijing as diplomatic stranglehold tightens around Taiwan]\n\nTaiwan said that Kiribati\u2019s government had notified it Friday that it was terminating relations. In response, Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it \u201cdeeply regrets and strongly condemns the Kiribati government\u2019s decision, which disregards the multifaceted assistance and sincere friendship extended by Taiwan to Kiribati over the years.\u201d\n\nThe statement said that Beijing had lured Kiribati into switching diplomatic recognition by promising full funding, rather than loans, for airplanes and commercial ferries. It said Beijing\u2019s aim was to destroy Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and force the island to accept a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement akin to the system of governance in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory.\n\n\n\nAn aerial view of Tarawa Atoll, Kiribati, in 2004.

(Richard Vogel/AP)\n\nTaipei said it was ending all bilateral cooperation and recalling diplomatic, technical and medical staff stationed in Kiribati.\n\nTaiwan split from the mainland in 1949 when Communist forces overran China, forcing the nationalist Kuomintang forces to flee to the island. Friday\u2019s move by Kiribati leaves only 15 nations that recognize democratic Taiwan as the legitimate government of China.\n\nChina, which vehemently opposes any moves toward Taiwanese independence, said Friday that it highly appreciates Kiribati\u2019s decision to reestablish ties with Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe support this important decision by Kiribati as a sovereign and independent nation,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters at a regular briefing. \u201cThere is only one China in the world, and the People\u2019s Republic of China government is the sole legal government representing the whole of China.\u201d\n\n[China takes aim at U.S. and Taiwan in new military blueprint]\n\nChina\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV relished in scoring two diplomatic coups in the same week.\n\n\u201cWhen it rains, it pours,\u201d it said in a \u201chot take\u201d post on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. \u201cHaving consecutively been told \u2018bye bye\u2019 has without a doubt shattered Taiwanese officials\u2019 glass heart.\u201d\n\nBeijing\u2019s drive to cut off Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic partners has fueled worries in Washington and among U.S. allies such as Australia. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a prominent critic of the Chinese Communist Party, said this week that he would explore ways to penalize the Solomon Islands for abandoning Taiwan.\n\n\n\nBetio Island, Tarawa Atoll, was the site of intense fighting during World War II when U.S. Marines forced back the Japanese militaryin November 1943. (AP)\n\nKwei-bo Huang, vice dean of international affairs at the National ChengChi University in Taiwan, said China\u2019s diplomatic campaign was an effort to thwart the Taiwan independence movement and disrupt the \u201cincreasingly salient supportive attitude of the United States toward Taiwan\u201d in recent years.\n\nKiribati occupies a strategic location in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, roughly halfway between the United States and Australia. The latter, along with Taiwan, has been a leading donor to Pacific nations, but Beijing is increasingly challenging that position in the Pacific as it woos small island states with promises of donations, loans and investment.\n\nGeng, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Friday that relations between China and Pacific island countries were enjoying \u201crapid development.\u201d\n\nRemote and sparsely populated, Kiribati spans a vast marine area and is home to rich fishing grounds. Yet it is underdeveloped even by Pacific standards and dependent on foreign aid, which contributed roughly a third of government finances in 2016, according to the CIA World Factbook.\n\nThe country is perhaps best known as the scene of bloody fighting during World War II, when American forces defeated the Japanese at the Battle of Tarawa. Later, the United States and Britain conducted nuclear tests in the archipelago during the Cold War, leaving a legacy of radioactive contamination.\n\nRead more\n\nSolomon Islands recognizes Beijing as diplomatic stranglehold tightens around Taiwan\n\nChina takes aim at U.S. and Taiwan in new military blueprint\n\nWhy Taiwan is watching Hong Kong very closely\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Kiribati switches allegiances as Beijing continues to pick off Taipei\u2019s diplomatic partners in an effort to pressure the government of Tsai Ing-wen.", "authors": ["David Crawshaw", "Asian Politics", "Geopolitics", "Especially North", "South Korea", "Southeast Asia", "Australia", "Gerry Shih", "China Correspondent", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_7Xx6woAr0P6VA7gq2BQtWEdEG8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OEFSMEG3PQI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
