Seiger said a meeting between the two parties depended on Sacoolas' willingness to return to Britain.\n\nSacoolas left Britain under a claim of diplomatic immunity that has become a point of contention between the two countries.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week urged U.S. President Donald Trump to reconsider a decision to let her claim immunity.\n\nTrump has said his administration would look into the matter, without offering details.\n\n\"It was a terrible accident,\" Trump told reporters last week. \"We're going to speak to her and we're going to see the person driving the car, the wife of the diplomat. We're going to speak to her and see what we can come up with so that there can be some healing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Maria Caspani, Editing by Bill Berkrot)", "description": "Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn spoke to media in New York during a visit intended put pressure on the Trump administration to have Anne Sacoolas to be sent back to face British investigators.
