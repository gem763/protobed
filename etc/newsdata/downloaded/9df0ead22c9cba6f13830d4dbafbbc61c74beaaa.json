Despite having no prior political experience, the 41-year-old won this year's presidential election by a landslide, promising to tackle corruption.\n\nTrump and Zelenskiy spoke by phone on July 25, during which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate the Biden family. Earlier, Trump had frozen nearly $400 million of aid to Ukraine, prompting his critics to accuse him of using the funds as leverage to pressure Zelenskiy to pursue the investigation. Zelenskiy denies being pressured.\n\n\n\n\n\nVIKTOR SHOKIN\n\nShokin became Ukraine's general prosecutor in February 2015. Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani allege that Joe Biden, as vice president, bullied the Ukrainian authorities to fire Shokin in March 2016 because he was investigating the activities of Biden's son Hunter at a Ukrainian gas company called Burisma.\n\nBiden and his son deny this version of events. During his tenure, Shokin's office was criticised by diplomats and anti-corruption activists as an obstacle to fighting corruption.\n\n\n\n\n\nYURIY LUTSENKO\n\nLutsenko succeeded Shokin as general prosecutor. This year he made a series of allegations to The Hill website in Washington that dovetailed with statements by Giuliani.\n\nThe statements, which were listed in the whistleblower report, included allegations that Ukrainian officials and a lawmaker had collaborated to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's behalf. He also alleged that the U.S. ambassador to Kiev had given him a list of people not to prosecute and that he was looking into Burisma and Biden's role at the company. He told Reuters last week he found no evidence of wrongdoing on Biden's part.\n\n\n\n\n\nRUSLAN RYABOSHAPKA\n\nLutsenko was fired after Zelenskiy became president. A former deputy justice minister who also worked at Transparency International briefly, Ryaboshapka became the new general prosecutor in August. He would lead any new investigation into the Biden family. Zelenskiy in his call with Trump boasted Ryaboshapka would \"100%\" be his person but this week stressed Ryaboshapka's office was independent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSERHIY LESHCHENKO\n\nA journalist turned lawmaker who in 2016 published details of off-the-books payments made by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich to Trump's then-campaign manager Paul Manafort.\n\nGiuliani has singled out Leshchenko as an enemy of Trump. He said Leshchenko's claims about Manafort were fraudulent and part of a conspiracy to help Clinton win the 2016 election. Leshchenko was an adviser to Zelenskiy during his campaign but quit after Giuliani's public statements about him.\n\n\n\n\n\nANDRIY YERMAK\n\nYermak is a Zelenskiy aide whose meeting with Giuliani, after Zelenskiy's call with Trump, was flagged in the whistleblower report. The whistleblower said U.S. officials characterized the meeting as a \"direct follow-up\" to the call.\n\n\n\n\n\nMYKOLA ZLOCHEVSKY\n\nZlochevsky founded Burisma in 2002. Zlochevsky headed Ukraine's Ministry of Environmental Protection from 2010-2012 and was a member of the Yanukovich's Party of Regions.\n\nIn 2012-2014, Zlochevsky worked as a deputy secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council which is in charge of all military and law-enforcement structures in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nMARIE YOVANOVITCH\n\nA career diplomat who had previously served as envoy to other ex-Soviet republics, Yovanovitch was the U.S. ambassador to Kiev until this year. Trump strongly criticised her in his phone call to Zelenskiy, and Zelenskiy agreed with Trump's criticism.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Alistair Bell)", "description": "Ukraine has become entangled in a political battle in Washington between President Donald Trump and the Democrats ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
