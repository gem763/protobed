According to Raw Story, this video was first posted by a Twitter feed called Passion Times which noted the woman in this clip was wearing an \u201cI love Hong Kong\u201d t-shirt. But the clip really took off on social media Monday after it was tweeted out by the Washington Examiner. The young woman, who appears to be American but claims to live in Hong Kong, lectured a small group of protesters about some signs and graffiti on concrete.\n\nAfter suggesting protests were a waste of time she asked, \u201cIs this okay? Is this respectful?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d one of the students replied.\n\n\u201cWhy not? If my mother saw me [write] this\u2026\u201d she said. After some back and forth she came to her point, \u201cViolence breeds violence, do you agree? Find me one case where violence led to a good solution?\u201d\n\nThe clip is very noisy at this point and one of the students who is looking away from the camera says something about freedom.\n\n\u201cSo the problem is, it\u2019s not the bad demands, it\u2019s you guys value freedom more than safety, do we agree?\u201d she said. She added, \u201cI think safety is more important than freedom. If you have a safe environment, you can communicate.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to say that \u201cold thinking\u201d like China\u2019s thinking even today, puts safety over freedom. At least she\u2019s honest about her own agreement with mainland China.\n\nThe problem with this lecture, obviously, is that valuing freedom more than safety, while not the Chinese way, is something close to the American way. The protesters in Hong Kong recognize that which is why some of them have been waving American flags during the protests. The idea that it would be better to succumb to Chinese totalitarian communism for the sake of preserving a dialogue overlooks one critical point: It wouldn\u2019t be a dialogue between equals. A master speaking to a servant is not a dialogue worth having.\n\nLast month, CBS News interviewed an anonymous student protester in Hong Kong who said, \u201cWe will give all we can give because we want to see a free world in our city and in our home. Freedom is never free and that is why we need to take the risks for the greater good for all the Hong Kong citizens.\u201d An American patriot couldn\u2019t have said it better. What a shame that this dopey woman is arguing against human freedom to a group of people on the verge of losing theirs.
