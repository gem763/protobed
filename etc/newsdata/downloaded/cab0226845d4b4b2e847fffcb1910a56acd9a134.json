No other city in the top ten saw a change to its score.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s Osaka was fourth, followed by three Canadian cities - Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto. Toronto was tied with Tokyo for seventh place. Copenhagen and Adelaide in South Australia rounded out the top 10.\n\nThe EIU\u2019s index ranks cities by five headline criteria. Stability and culture & environment are the two most important categories, weighted equally at 25% of the total. Healthcare and infrastructure are also matched at 20%, with education coming in last with a 10% weighting.\n\n\u201cParis in France is the highest-ranked city to have seen a deterioration in its stability score, owing to the ongoing anti-government gilets jaunes protests that began in late 2018,\u201d the EIU said of the French anti-government movement.\n\nParis slid six places to 25th, from 19th last year.\n\nThe culture and environment scores were reduced for many cities in poorer countries that are among the most exposed to the effects of climate change, including New Delhi and Cairo for their poor air quality.\n\nDamascus in war-torn Syria remained the worst-ranked city, below Lagos in Nigeria and the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, which swapped places.", "description": "Vienna has held off Melbourne to retain the top spot on the Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Index for 2019, further strengthening its reputation as the world's most pleasant city, while the 'gilets jaunes' protests hurt Paris' score.", "authors": ["Francois Murphy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
