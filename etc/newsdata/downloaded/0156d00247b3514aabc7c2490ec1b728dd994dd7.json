Throughout the ongoing chess match, the president has repeatedly demonstrated the qualities that made him a consummate deal-maker in the business world, validating the expectations that so many Americans had when they voted to send him to Washington in 2016.\n\nThe president has demonstrated that he knows when to be tough \u2014 as he has been with his strategic counter-tariffs \u2014 and when to extend a friendly hand. Since the U.S.-China trade talks opened, the president has made both grand professions of friendship towards China and harsh criticisms of Chinese leadership, carefully managing expectations so that Beijing would know that he\u2019s serious about achieving a trade deal, but only one that secures a genuinely level playing field.\n\nThroughout all of this, the president\u2019s critics have predicted that standing up to China would lead to imminent economic collapse, national humiliation, and certain electoral defeat, but he has drowned out the noise and stayed the course, committed to securing a historic trade deal that will define the 21st century.\n\nWhenever talks have appeared to reach a standstill, the president has skillfully brought China back to the table. Just recently, as a \u201cgesture of good will\u201d ahead of China\u2019s upcoming anniversary celebrations, the president pushed back scheduled tariffs by two weeks in response to a request from China\u2019s Vice Premier and chief trade negotiator, Liu He.\n\nPresident Trump understood that the symbolic weight of the 70th Anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China created an opportunity to demonstrate America\u2019s capacity for benevolence, and he used that opening to maximum advantage. As we approach the next round of talks, such displays of generosity are integral to the president\u2019s strategy of showing Beijing what it has to gain from a genuinely fair trade deal with the U.S., with our existing counter-tariffs serving to remind China\u2019s leaders of what their country has to lose if they continue to engage in trade practices that cheat the American people.\n\nAdditionally, President Trump\u2019s negotiating prowess has served him well in other negotiations, allowing him to score big wins with Mexico, Canada, the European Union, South Korea, and Japan.\n\nOn the domestic front, however, the Democrats have insisted on obstructing the president\u2019s agenda at every turn, even forfeiting their own policy goals in order to deny him political victories. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that President Trump negotiated to replace NAFTA, for instance, has been languishing for months because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has refused to bring the measure to a vote.\n\nOn the rare occasions when congressional Democrats have been willing to work with the president on bipartisan priorities, the results have proven spectacular. The historic FIRST STEP Act, for instance, achieved major criminal justice reforms that had eluded politicians from both parties for decades.\n\nBut on other issues of mutual interest, the Democrats have refused to even hold talks. Even when President Trump has invited Democrat leaders to the White House for face-to-face negotiations, they\u2019ve been more interested in putting on a public relations spectacle than in putting their shoulder to the wheel and getting things done.\n\nThe president has voiced willingness to work with the Democrats on gun control, immigration reform, infrastructure, and health care policy. But on each of those issues, the Democrats have decided that obstruction better serves their political interests.\n\nThat\u2019s no way to negotiate, but President Trump has faced far tougher negotiators than Nancy Pelosi, and he knows that it\u2019s sometimes better to abstain from talks with someone who doesn\u2019t want any deal than to seek them out for a bad one. As we watch the president continue to negotiate circles around Beijing, we can take comfort that this master deal-maker knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.", "description": "It\u2019s always fun to watch an expert at work, and .09/18/2019 3:24:46AM EST.", "authors": ["Ken Blackwell", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/256/176da027-e190-47f2-a5a3-ed0974377d9f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
