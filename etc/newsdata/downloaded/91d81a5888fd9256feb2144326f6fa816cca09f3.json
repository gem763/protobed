By Saturday afternoon, his concerns had deepened when he put in a call to Camp David, where Mr. Mulvaney was hosting moderate congressional Republicans for a discussion of issues facing them, including impeachment, and was told the consensus was he should reverse himself. Those moderates are among the votes Mr. Trump would need to stick with him during an impeachment.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see it being a big negative, but it certainly wasn\u2019t a positive,\u201d said Representative Peter T. King of New York, one of those at Camp David. He said the group told Mr. Trump\u2019s aides that sticking with the decision \u201cwould be a distraction.\u201d\n\nWith many members already unhappy with the consequences of the president\u2019s move to withdraw troops from Syria, and Democrats pressing their impeachment inquiry, Republicans on Capitol Hill were not eager to have to defend the appropriateness of the president\u2019s decision to host the Group of 7 meeting at one of his own properties.\n\n\u201cI think there was a lot of concern,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a member of the Republicans\u2019 leadership team. \u201cI\u2019m not sure people questioned the legality of it, but it clearly was an unforced political error.\u201d\n\nMr. Cole said he did not speak to the president directly about it, but expressed relief that Mr. Trump had changed his mind, and was certain that other Republicans felt the same way. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t need this,\u201d he said.", "description": "He knew Democrats would criticize him.
