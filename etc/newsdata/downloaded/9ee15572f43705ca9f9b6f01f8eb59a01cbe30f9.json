Another reviewer doesn\u2019t typically sleep on planes because he found it too hard to get comfortable. But he says that \u201call changed\u201d as soon as he found this pillow.\u201cIt really helped me to cinch it up to support my head from bobbing forward or to the side, all while being comfortable with the soft memory foam, instead of those lame pillows with beans/beads in them that don\u2019t have an adjustable front strap and don\u2019t give you much support.\u201d And one more agrees that compared to other options, this one is stellar. \u201cIt\u2019s nice enough that it\u2019s memory foam, but it\u2019s very thick (great for wedging your head between the seat and the wall of the train) and it\u2019s contoured in a way that fits nicely around the head and neck,\u201d he writes, though he does warn that it\u2019s bulky and so doesn\u2019t fit easily in a tight carry-on or suitcase. But it\u2019s okay: \u201cI can clip the pillow to the outside and don\u2019t have to worry about carrying it or accidentally dropping it.\u201d", "description": "The best travel pillows on Amazon, including memory foam pillows, microbead pillows, foldable pillows, pillows for lumbar support, inflatable pillows, compressible pillows, adjustable pillows and more.
