Influencers paid to sell the dream of bodily perfection to mere mortals on Instagram.\n\nSometimes, the mission of these detox tea brands is explicit \u2014 companies such as Flat Tummy Co, Skinny Mint and Slendertox make no bones about the endgame of drinking their concoctions. But for others, like Teami Blends or Bootea, the weight loss aspect of their wares is simply implied, hidden behind \u201cwellness\u201d terms that function under a thin veneer of euphemisms meaning \u201cthin\u201d.\n\nTeas which are thought to have aesthetic benefits are nothing new. Throughout history, teas including green and oolong have been hailed as a cure for all sorts of ailments, including weight loss. But how they are marketed has changed considerably.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cDetox\u201d, \u201cskinny\u201d and \u201ccleansing\u201d teas that promise weight loss are big business, endorsed by the likes of billionaire reality star Kylie Jenner and rapper Cardi B on social media, who boast 142 million and 48.4 million Instagram followers, respectively. Meanwhile, the hashtag #teatox garners over 870k posts on Instagram on side-by-side photos of a drinkers\u2019 detox \u201cjourneys\u201d.The retail value of the health and wellness market in the UK is worth over \u20ac24 million (\u00a321.6 million) and is likely to reach $15.5 billion (\u00a312.6 billion) by 2024 in the US. And it\u2019s not a surprise, given that several detox tea brands are charging well over \u00a310 for a packet. In many instances you can buy a long-lasting supply costing hundreds of pounds. But not everyone is keen to take a sip.\n\nDangers of laxative-inducing teas\n\nAs anyone who has struggled for several hours on the toilet with constipation will know, laxatives are a type of medicine that loosen stools and increase bowel movements. According to the NHS, there are four main types of laxatives, with one being stimulants that help the muscles that line the gut move stool along. Among the ingredients in such laxatives is senna, which is also know by its brand name: Senokot.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

While those with constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) might get relief from senna (it\u2019s available on prescription and to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets), those with healthy bowels are warned not to take it without speaking to a doctor or pharmacist in the first instance as a result of its health-altering properties.\n\n\u201cWhen taken in excess or chronically, laxatives can damage the gut lining along with causing nutrient depletion, dehydration and malabsorption,\u201d Charlotte Kinder, a British Association for Nutrition and Lifestyle Medicine (BANT)-certified nutritional therapist, tells The Independent. \u201cIn some cases, anal blisters along with anaemia or other nutrient-deficient disorders can also occur.\u201d\n\nCommon side effects of taking senna (which occur in more than one in 100 people, according to the NHS) include stomach cramps, diarrhoea, and discoloured urine. Rare but \u201cserious\u201d side effects of the laxative include severe raised, red, itchy skin. \u201cIn rare cases, it\u2019s possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to senna,\u201d states the organisation. Even detox teas that don\u2019t use senna contain natural diuretics such as dandelion root, which can cause dehydration. A quick scroll through online reviews for weight loss teas and you\u2019ll find several users complaining of common symptoms of both senna-based products and those containing natural diuretics. The side effects most frequently mentioned are stomach pains, gas and bloating, loose and foul-smelling stools, frequent urination and headaches.\n\n\u201cThe healthy colon is meant to contain a wide range of bacteria \u2013 and in this context \u2018detox\u2019 is a meaningless term.\u201d Dr Helen Fidler\n\n\u201cOnline sellers state that these are harmless, temporary side effects, and are simply a result of the tea removing all harmful toxins from the body,\u201d says Harriet Smith, a dietician registered with the British Dietetic Association (BDA). \u201cThey say that headaches are attributed to mild dehydration, and suggest that users drink plenty of water to overcome them. However, diuretic-induced urination combined with diarrhoea can quickly result in severe dehydration, which can be dangerous.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Bootea found itself under criticism after its \u201cTeatox\u201d teas were blamed for a string of accidental pregnancies (not-so-amusingly named as \u201cBootea babies\u201d) as its \u201claxative effect\u201d can stop the contraceptive pill from working.\n\nThe NHS states that if women have diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, they should count each day with sickness or diarrhoea as a day that they have missed the pill missed your pill. \u201cIf you can, you should carry on taking your pills at the normal time, but you may need to use extra contraception, such as condoms,\u201d it adds. In the FAQs section of the brand\u2019s website, the company acknowledge these risks, explaining that the teas \u201cmay affect the accuracy of the pill\u201d and warning consumers that they \u201ccan\u2019t comment\u201d on whether those conceiving, pregnant or breastfeeding should consume the tea. Your average PG Tips, this most certainly is not.\n\nDr Toni Hazell, a part-time GP and e-learning development fellow for the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), has further concerns. \u201cOveruse of diuretics and senna can upset the balance of sodium and potassium in the body \u2013 in extreme cases this can be fatal, as high or low potassium can upset the electrical activity of the heart,\u201d Dr Hazell explains. \u201cThere is no evidence that any of these slimming products work.\u201d\n\nDetox controversy\n\nThe word \u201cdetox\u201d has been welcomed into society\u2019s vernacular to describe everything and anything that\u2019s seemingly \u201cguilt-free\u201d: time spent at a spa, not checking your phone, a day without make-up and washing your hair. While the word can be used for those needing rehabilitation following substance abuse (alcohol, drugs etc) it appears to be a dangerous buzzword when used in a weight loss context.\n\n\u201cClearly, we all choose our drinks according to our personal tastes, but to market them as \u2018detox\u2019 when they frequently contain nothing more than cheap senna laxative is misleading,\u201d says Dr Helen Fidler, consultant gastroenterologist and member of British Society of Gastroenterologists (BSG). \u201cThe healthy colon is meant to contain a wide range of bacteria \u2013 and in this context \u2018detox\u2019 is a meaningless term.\u201d\n\nThe weight lost after drinking detox teas is water and faeces \u2013 not fat. \u201cDetox, in a health context, is ridding the body of toxins through clearing and elimination. Weight loss is ridding the body of body fat,\u201d explains Kinder. \u201cRecent research has shown that despite the growing popularity of detoxification for weight loss, there are limited studies that actually show these particular regimens are beneficial for long-term weight loss. They mainly work in the short-term through their associated low caloric intake. In fact, in the long-term those having lost weight on calorie-restricted, detoxification protocols tend to experience weight gain once a normal diet is resumed.\u201d\n\nSpilling the tea\n\nPutting the physical dangers or the semantics of \u201cdetox\u201d aside, the mental toll detox brands can have on users is insidious and can corroborate an already pervasive message that thin is king.\n\nAimee Victoria Long, 26, once used detox teas regularly, with Bootea being her preferred brand. \u201cI became obsessed,\u201d she tells The Independent. \u201cI was constantly nauseous and always on the toilet. I became addicted to that feeling. I went on to diet pills and other laxatives. Eventually I got admitted into a specialist eating disorders unit.\u201d\n\nLong is now a personal trainer with almost 70,000 followers on Instagram on which she shares images of healthy meals and videos of her workouts. Despite the healthy living ethos she promotes online, Long says she is inundated with offers from \u201cteatox\u201d companies asking her to promote their products for financial gain. \u201cI don\u2019t want to promote something that has a negative effect on other young women,\u201d she admits.\n\nRecent findings from The Mental Health Foundation reveal that one in eight adults has had suicidal thoughts because of the way they feel about their body. Molly Forbes, a body positivity campaigner and co-presenter on the Body Cons podcast believes that a huge element of the problem is the diet culture we live in.\n\n\u201cIt promotes unrealistic beauty ideals, a particular narrative that a healthy body only looks one way and presents diets, detox teas and \u2018quick fix\u2019 weight loss products as the answer,\u201d Forbes says. \u201cThe evidence points to the fact weight is a really nuanced subject, and there are many different factors that affect a person\u2019s weight \u2013 it\u2019s not just a simple case of how much they eat or how much exercise they do. She continues, adding that detox teas ignore additional factors, creating a culture of blame and preying on peoples\u2019 insecurities. \u201cThe mental health ramifications of this are huge, from disordered eating and full blown eating disorders to social anxiety, reduced quality of life and \u2013 as the Mental Health Foundation recently found out \u2013 even suicidal thoughts,\u201d the campaigner adds.\n\nIn recent months, several people have called out \u201cteatox\u201d brands and social media influencers out for using harmful ingredients in their products and exploiting the insecurities of people they advertise to.\n\nIn June, model Amber Rose \u2013 who was pregnant with her second child at the time \u2013 faced criticism for promoting a detox tea for pregnant women from the Flat Tummy Co. According to Rose, the tea is meant to help mothers on those \u201cbloated, nauseous, blah feeling days\u201d. In response, actor and body neutrality campaigner Jameela Jamil questioned whether the tea had received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, and has since labelled detox tea companies everything from \u201cgross\u201d to \u201cevil\u201d. \u201cDon\u2019t take diet advice from celebrities,\u201d reads one of Jamil\u2019s recent social media posts. \u201cThey don\u2019t give a f**k about you or your kidneys or your liver or your mental health. Unfollow, delete, repeat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people would think twice if they were aware of the science \u2013 or lack of \u2013 behind these frilly pink-packaged products.\u201d Emma Whittaker\n\nCampaigner Emma Whittaker recently started a Change.org petition to ban detox teas without a prescription after being heavy user herself and developing bulimia and mental health issues as a result. \u201cWhen I first started drinking the teas on the recommended dose my symptoms included severe stomach cramps, diarrhoea, constipation and extreme fatigue,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAfter over a month of drinking the teas, the original symptoms continued and I additionally began messing myself in public, experienced heart palpitations and ended up in A&E.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, Whittaker had grown reliant on \u201cdetox\u201d teas to go to the toilet. \u201cI was prescribed a low dose of laxatives by the doctor to help wean my body off them and ease horrible constipation,\u201d she explains.\n\nWhittaker is emphatic that social media blurred the reality of what such teas actually were. \u201cWhen celebrities and influencers endorse these medicinal products they never highlight the fact they can alter both your physical and mental health,\u201d she says. \u201cI think people would think twice if they were aware of the science \u2013 or lack of \u2013 behind these frilly pink-packaged products.\u201d\n\nIn the description of her petition, which has over 2,100 signatures, Whittaker writes: \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to look after our children, we shouldn\u2019t be marketing laxatives to them in pretty pink packaging.\u201d But it\u2019s not surprising influencers want to cash in on the financial profitability of detox teas. Many brands offer a flat fee for a picture although other brands operate a commission-based payment system.\n\nKatie Meehan, a beauty and lifestyle influencer and blogger who promotes equality and diversity to her 20,000 followers on Instagram, has been given plenty of opportunities to promote detox teas, but has turned them down. Meehan, who has spoken in Parliament on equality in education, says she has always been approached by email from one brand itself, which typically adopt a \u201chey babe\u201d tone is she believes is unprofessional and patronising. The influencer explains that the offers to promote the teas tend to be commission based, with the company offering her 10 to 20 per cent of what she sells.\n\n\u201cNot all campaigns need to use influencers with millions of followers,\u201d explains Thomas Walters, founder at Billion Dollar Boy (BDB), an influencer marketing agency which splits influencers into four categories: Celebrity (500k plus followers), Macros ( 100k plus), Mid (30k plus) and Micro (10k to 30k). These categories help to determine payment.\n\nWhile BDB aren\u2019t affiliated to a detox tea brand, their fees for talent per post for beauty products including Nars, Primark and Tangle Teeze typically range from \u00a325 to \u00a310,000. Meanwhile, reality star Kris Jenner once admitted her famous children can command a six-figure sum for one sponsored on social media. \u201cSometimes, if it\u2019s Kim [Kardashian], or if it\u2019s Kylie, it depends on what it really is,\u201d Jenner told CBS Sunday Morning in April of the fees for her daughters\u2019 posts. \u201c[If it\u2019s] a pharmaceutical product, if it\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to drink, or ingest, or put on your body, [the price goes up].\u201d\n\nBut are there any regulations in place about how much an influencer must know about a product or how much they must have used it before they can promote?\n\nAre detox teas ASA compliant?\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)\u2019s broadcast code prohibits the use of advertisements that \u201cmislead consumers by omitting material information\u201d.The ASA regularly enforces the removal of ads that make misleading or unsubstantiated claims about weight loss so how is it that the promotion of detox teas haven\u2019t been banned? \u201cThey must not mislead by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner,\u201d its code reads.\n\nForbes, who is also regularly approached by \u201cteatox\u201d companies including Teami Blends, with collaboration offers, believes this is because existing regulations are a grey area which detox tea companies exploit and shield under the term \u201cbody positivity\u201d. \u201cThese companies are co-opting body positivity because they can see how popular it is as a movement, and twisting it for their own marketing purposes,\u201d she says. \u201cBut their message isn\u2019t to accept your body. Their message is \u2018your body will only be acceptable if you use our products\u2019.\u201d\n\nHowever, Adi Arezzini, CEO of Teami Blends which has been promoted by Kylie Jenner and which sells products containing senna, disagrees. \u201cI do not believe in the type of marketing that makes a woman not feel amazing in her own skin,\u201d she says. \u201cPersonally, I am not a stick skinny woman and I do not promote that in our marketing.\u201d This is despite the fact that Teami Blends sells a \u2018Skinny Tea\u2019 and has before and after weight loss transformation pictures on its Instagram.\n\nNevertheless, Arezzini asserts that Teami isn\u2019t intended for long-term use, adding: \u201cThe purpose of the detox is to do a gentle cleanse of the body, removing toxins and helping the customer feel better overall.\u201d As for the brand\u2019s use of senna, the entrepreneur says that the plant has been \u201cused to for centuries as a holistic solution to digestion\u201d.\n\nNatasha Grano, 29, a London-based influencer with over one million followers on Instagram has promoted Skinny Mint tea in the past, a decision she stands by. Grano says she was once sent two months-worth of the tea, which she drank, despite Skinny Mint not checking up with her to see if that was the case. \u201cOnce I had [the tea] they left it over to me,\u201d says Grano, who was paid a four-figure sum in return for a picture and a video on social media. \u201cPeople call it a boxed laxative but I don\u2019t think so \u2013 if you use it properly it won\u2019t harm you,\u201d claims Grano. \u201cI had no negative effects, but I did need the loo quite a lot more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe future of the promotion of detox teas and actually, the existence of detox teas in general is uncertain and shaky,\u201d Emma Glazier\n\nSteven Curran, CEO of Bootea adds that under EU law, all food put on sale must be safe and fit for human consumption. \u201cTherefore, we ensure we provide all required warnings, guidance and due diligence demanded by relevant regulations and directives,\u201d Curran adds.\n\nBut for Kinder, the message is simple: \u201cThere can never be a replacement for a balanced diet and lifestyle for weight loss nor for long-term weight maintenance.\u201d\n\nThe future of detox teas\n\nWhile Instagram feeds continue to be littered with images of influencers promoting detox teas, it would seem that the tide is slowly turning when it comes not only to their prominence but acceptance online.\n\nEmma Glazier, global head of social media at creative agency Crowd, believes that this, in part, is because the ethics and transparency of brands are becoming increasingly important to consumers. \u201cThe future of the promotion of detox teas and actually, the existence of detox teas in general is uncertain and shaky,\u201d she notes.\n\nAccording to Glazier, 30 per cent of business-to-business (B2B) buyers will disengage from a brand whose values don\u2019t match their own and just as many consumers will stop shopping at retail companies whose ethics they don\u2019t agree with. If a brand wants to stay relevant, truthful, and be a success, they need to show their stance on people, ethics and the \u201cbig social issues\u201d of the day, she adds. \u201cIn other words, brands should have an altruistic purpose and brand values. Those who don\u2019t, will lose sales. As a matter of fact, 48 per cent of marketers agree that they have lost sales in the last two years because they haven\u2019t demonstrated a strong enough sense of brand purpose.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the only detox we all need is from who we follow on social media.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Skinny Mint, Slendertox, Flat Tummy Co for comment but have not received a response.", "description": "We\u2019ve all seen them: trim, tanned, perfectly-manicured;\u00a0posing in spotless marble-surfaced kitchens and caressing pastel-hued packets of detox tea like it\u2019s the latest \u201cmust-have\u201d fashion accessory.
