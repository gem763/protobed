That fire ranks as the state's deadliest on record.\n\nResponding to the latest windstorms over the weekend, PG&E turned off electricity to 970,000 homes and workplaces in 37 counties in northern and central California, encompassing millions of people across more than half of PG&;E's service area of 70,000 square miles.\n\nThat tally far surpassed the previous record planned outage of 730,000 customers during high winds two weeks ago.\n\nCalifornia regulators say they will open a formal probe into whether utilities companies violated any rules by cutting power to millions of residents over the weekend to reduce the risk of wildfires.

He is pictured last Thursday\n\nThe inquiry will examine utility compliance with agency regulations, as well as 'any resulting violations' and potential penalties, the statement said.\n\nFines of up to $100,000 per violation per day and additional penalties can be assessed for violations, agency spokesman Christopher Chow said. PG&E was previously slapped with a record $1.6 billion penalty for a deadly 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, California.\n\nBatjer also plans to reevaluate protocols for precautionary outages and how utilities can minimize them.\n\nResponding to the commission, PG&E said, 'We are constantly working to minimize the impact of these safety shut-offs while prioritizing public safety.' It said the blackouts' only purpose 'is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire in the communities that we serve.'\n\nPG&E acknowledged last week that a major wildfire in Sonoma County wine country erupted near a damaged a transmission tower owned by the utility at about the time a live high-voltage line carried by that tower malfunctioned.\n\nMeanwhile, the utility also said Monday that its power lines may have started two wildfires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nFires have been burning in Northern California's wine country since last week, and nearly 200,000 people remain under evacuation orders\n\nThe fires described in PG&E reports to state regulators match blazes that destroyed a tennis club and forced urgent evacuations in the town of Lafayette, about 22 miles east of San Francisco.\n\nPG&E told the California Public Utilities Commission that a worker responded to the first fire around 4:45 p.m. Sunday and was told firefighters believe contact between a power line and a communication line may have caused it.\n\nA worker went to another fire about an hour later and saw a fallen pole and transformer.\n\nContra Costa fire Department personnel on site told the worker they were looking at the transformer as a potential ignition source, a company official wrote.\n\nPowerful winds are driving multiple fires across Northern California and forcing power shut-offs intended to prevent downed power lines that can spark blazes. The company says the Lafayette blazes did not begin in areas designated as high risk for wildfire.\n\nTens of thousands of acres are currently on fire in Northern California, with nearly 200,000 people ordered out of their homes through mandatory evacuations.\n\nMeanwhile, fires are also raging in Los Angeles, with one blaze coming perilously close to the Getty Museum which houses artworks by Rembrandt, Manet and Monet.", "description": "The announcement on Monday did not single out any utilities by name, but the bulk of 'public safety power shut-offs' under scrutiny were implemented by Pacific Gas and Electric Co, a unit of PG&E Corp.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/06/20313440-0-image-a-9_1572330267751.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
