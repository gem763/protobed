(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen onetime governor Mike Pence and consultant Seema Verma ran Indiana\u2019s conservative health-care system, they found a creative way to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act when many other red states rejected it.\n\nNow, with Pence as vice president and Verma as the head of the federal Medicaid and Medicare programs, Indiana is again blazing its own path on health care, with the Trump administration\u2019s avid encouragement.\n\nLike other states, Indiana recently imposed work requirements on some of the state\u2019s 1.4 million Hoosiers who receive benefits under the health program for low-income Americans. But only a fraction of those Medicaid recipients, estimated at 70,000 people, will actually be affected, according to the state.\n\nIn fact, the state\u2019s secretary of health has made a bold promise that not a single person will lose coverage under its \u201cGateway to Work\u201d program.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt anybody, we\u2019re just making progress in Indiana in improving our health outcomes. We don\u2019t want to change that \u2014 that trajectory is important,\u201d Indiana Family and Social Services Administration Secretary Jennifer Walthall said in a recent interview.\n\nUnlike Kentucky, Arkansas and New Hampshire, Indiana isn\u2019t facing massive pushback against its version of work requirements \u2014 so far, there have been no legal challenges against it, unlike the ones that resulted in rulings barring their implementation in other states.\n\nThere so far has been no massive drop-off in coverage as there has been in Arkansas, where ultimately more than 18,000 enrollees \u2014 about one-fourth of those subject to work requirements there \u2014 were booted before a federal judge ruled against the state.\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing those rulings as it seeks ways to curtail parts of the ACA following Congress\u2019s failure to repeal and replace it. Work requirements surrounding Medicaid, which expanded dramatically under the ACA, are one way administration officials are seeking to put their stamp on the U.S. health-care system. While President Obama refused to sign off on work requirements, Verma\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has approved them in nine states.\n\nWalthall says her goal in implementing Indiana\u2019s work requirements isn\u2019t to lock people out of safety-net services but to instead prompt them to seek out such services.\n\n\u201cWe have to build a program that actually delivers those services, not makes it harder to get them,\u201d Walthall said.\n\nIf Arkansas and Kentucky were heavy-handed in imposing their work requirements, Indiana\u2019s program is more like a tap on the shoulder, advocates argue.\n\n\u201cWe are so different than those other states,\u201d said Susan Jo Thomas, executive director of Covering Kids and Families of Indiana, a leading group promoting enrollment in safety-net programs. \u201cThis is not your Arkansas work requirement, this is not your Kentucky work requirement.\u201d\n\nAs the battle over the ACA rages at the federal level, several Republican-led states are heeding calls from Verma to impose new work and volunteering requirements on Medicaid recipients for a program that covers 65 million low-income Americans. The Trump administration says the requirements encourage personal responsibility, but judges have blocked them as tens of thousands of people saw their coverage jeopardized or dropped entirely.\n\nIndiana \u2014 which has requirements that are more limited in scope and gradual in implementation \u2014 is emerging as a test case of whether it\u2019s possible to require work or volunteering hours to receive Medicaid without also prompting widespread confusion and coverage losses.\n\nOfficials here say the state is taking a different path, with Walthall vowing that the requirements, which technically went into effect in January, will be rolled out so gradually that no one currently receiving coverage will lose it.\n\nWalthall argues the purpose of work requirements is to identify the Medicaid enrollees who can take the next step toward self-reliance and give them a push in that direction. The idea \u2014 one Verma frequently touts \u2014 is that higher levels of employment and education are linked to better health and increased well-being.\n\n\u201cCan people access more education than they thought they would, can they access employment that they didn\u2019t think they could, can they be more engaged in their community and can that end up with improved health outcomes?\u201d Walthall said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to evaluate.\u201d\n\nNot everyone buys that argument. Fran Quigley, director of the Health and Human Rights Clinic at Indiana University\u2019s law school, said he believes work requirements will cause people to lose coverage and won\u2019t improve their overall health.\n\n\u201cLet me just be real blunt about this . . . this is a politically motivated lie,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are inevitably going to cut people in Indiana off of their health care.\u201d\n\nOthers argue work requirements are a means of increasing political support for Indiana\u2019s Medicaid expansion under the ACA. Republicans who dominate both state legislative chambers here are generally wary of anything related to Obamacare.\n\nTo gain GOP support for expanding Medicaid in 2015, Pence added a requirement for enrollees to contribute a monthly premium pegged to their income and shut them out of the program for up to six months if they failed to pay it.\n\n\u201cThere are political trade-offs being made here,\u201d said Kosali Simon, a health economics professor at Indiana University. \u201cWhat are ways to get business done in Indiana in a way that is politically successful?\u201d\n\nIndiana\u2019s work requirements will affect only about 5 percent of its Medicaid population: those who are in Indiana\u2019s expansion program under Obamacare, called the \u201cHealthy Indiana Plan\u201d (HIP). There are more than a dozen exemptions, including for pregnant women, those who are too sick to work and caregivers of young children.\n\nOfficials say many of those who would be affected may already be employed or involved in other activities that satisfy the requirements, including job searching, job training, volunteering or taking college courses.\n\nThe state is also slowly implementing the requirements. Although the conditions went into effect in January, enrollees didn\u2019t have to start reporting partial hours until July. A full 80 hours of eligible work will need to be reported a year from now to qualify for Medicaid coverage in the HIP program. Participants would lose coverage only if they fail to meet those requirements five or more months out of the year.\n\nFurthermore, there is no \u201clockout\u201d period for failing to meet the requirements, which would prevent someone who loses coverage from immediately reentering the program once they comply with it.\n\nWalthall says she\u2019s afraid enrollment in HIP will drop just because of \u201cfearmongering\u201d about work requirements.\n\nNo one has yet sued Indiana over the new limits \u2014 perhaps reflecting its go-slow approach. Verma said she wouldn\u2019t address Indiana specifically, given her work there in the past. She said letting states implement work requirements in different ways is crucial to discover how to do it well.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s different ways to approach this, and I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to allow different states to do this,\u201d Verma told reporters in August.\n\n\u201cThere are some lessons Indiana has definitely learned because we\u2019ve had a slow ramp up by watching what was done wrong in those [states],\u201d added Mark Fairchild, director of policy for Covering Kids and Families of Indiana.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell whether Walthall will be able to keep her promise of no one losing coverage, as enrollees have until year\u2019s end to report their work hours. Jim Gavin, a spokesman for Indiana\u2019s Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA), said \u201cthousands\u201d have reported working so far but the state isn\u2019t ready to share specific figures.\n\nOfficials insist they\u2019ve make sure everyone is aware of the new requirements. The FSSA communications team says it has sent 1.2 million emails to Medicaid expansion enrollees and disseminated digital and print ads specifically targeting them.\n\nMedicaid plans themselves are also involved in the effort. Kevin O\u2019Toole, president of Managed Health Services, one of four plans in Indiana that covers Medicaid patients, said his agency has mostly relied on email blasts to educate consumers.\n\nO\u2019Toole stressed that just 15 percent of his plan\u2019s 67,000 HIP members will be subject to the requirements. Of those, an estimated one-third are fulfilling the requirements already. He said the state seems receptive to suggestions, with officials including an exemption for homeless people at his group\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at how this program has been rolled out, there has been a great deal of advance communication and there\u2019s a tremendous amount of attentiveness,\u201d O\u2019Toole said. \u201cThey\u2019re really not trying to exploit people.\u201d\n\nWork requirements still don\u2019t belong in an ideal world for Thomas or Fairchild, who worry about any barrier to people who depend on safety-net programs. But both said they\u2019ve been impressed by the state\u2019s slow ramp-up and state officials\u2019 willingness to consider their concerns. They meet with Walthall on a near-weekly basis to share feedback.\n\n\u201cBy their statement of no one losing coverage, they\u2019ve taken on a pretty massive burden to make sure that happens, and that\u2019s something they\u2019re going to be held accountable for,\u201d Fairchild said.", "description": "The state health secretary vows no one will lose coverage under her plan.", "authors": ["Paige Winfield Cunningham", "National Reporter Focused On Health-Care Policy", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eX86BcGULGA-SDSlWGxHCCr--Fw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D62JVFSKFQI6PGD4IKVVORO3FY.jpg"}
