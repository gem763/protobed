Alongside images of the car, she wrote: 'This is a 59 plate (also known as 2009) Ford Fiesta - not a focus, not a clio and certainly not a flying carpet.\n\n'The car is grey - don't ask me what shade of grey it is, all I know is it's a special colour changing paint as it looks black when it's dark... as does everything else around it - funny that.\n\n'It is a 1.6 tdci (a diesel) - it's good on fuel - no this doesn't mean you can throw a fiver in it, break down after 80 miles then ring me saying I lied about the fuel economy - use your noggin.\n\nShe also admits that when she's sold cars in the past and has come across a lot of 'idiot's' who think the can take advantage of her because she's female\n\n'The car is a three door - one door on the left, one door on the right and a tailgate to the rear - you may use any of those doors to enter and exit the vehicle if you want to mix things up a bit.\n\nShe went on to say: 'The car is open to a full inspection - this can include seeing which awfully cheap lowering springs you could order off eBay for it.\n\n'How big the boot is to fit your sub woofer in, which you'll secure with a bungee and used red bull cans.\n\n'How many 99p blue bulbs you can fit into the interior lighting and of course, how many storage compartments there are to keep your grinder and 10bag for your career in herbal dealing.'\n\nThe motorsport mechanic took to Facebook and wrote a hilarious advert which has now racked up more than 44,000 shares\n\nThose who liked the post left comments congratulating her on such a funny advert calling it 'first class'\n\nShe went on to talk about the price of the car and what she wasn't going to accept anything other than that offer: 'So, the car is up for sale for \u00a32750 - that does not translate to any of the following...\n\n'I offer payment plans. I\u2019ll take \u00a3500. I\u2019ll hold onto it for 3 months whilst you save up your dole money.\n\n'I\u2019ll loan you the car with the promise you\u2019ll pay me for it to then have it returned to me by the old bill after it was used for a day light robbery (not my 1st choice for a getaway car I must say). Allow you to take it for a 3 day test drive.'\n\nWhile she also joked about experiences she'd had in the past when it came to test drives: 'Going back to test drives - if you can\u2019t show me proof of insurance, then I am more than happy to take you for a spin in the car. By spin, I mean take it around the block and demonstrate all gears work correctly, brakes work and throttle without any components falling off the car.\n\n'If at any point whilst I\u2019m driving, you decide to try and find chav FM on the radio, adjust my mirrors, press any buttons, or god forbid, attempt to speak to me, I will kindly leave you on the side of the road.\n\nLaura posted the funny advert for her brother's car (pictured) on Facebook and didn't hold back\n\nAt the end, she added: 'Last but not least, if you happen to be that absolute k***er who comes to view the car, realises I'm of the female kind and attempts to tell me how the car is broken in anyway shape or form, I promise to waste a minimum of 50 minutes of your time going along with your lies,\n\n'Purely for entertainment, s***s and giggles, making you think you're going to get the car for half the price, followed by mid conversation, shaking your hand and kindly telling you to p*ss off.\n\n'So yep... there you have it. Fiesta. Grey. Diesel. Goes brum. \u00a32750'\n\nOther social media users thought the post was hilarious. Clare Weatherston commented: 'That is first class, absolutely love it.'\n\nMatthew Garbett wrote: 'Love it.. that attitude not car.. fair play.'\n\nLaura revealed that despite all the attention form the post the car, a grey Ford Fiesta, has yet to sell\n\nWhile Nikita Isles wrote: 'Possibly the best add I've seen, the blue lights and sub woofer is spot on as well as the red bull cans.'\n\nElizabeth Gregory added: 'Love this, when we're selling ours can we contact you?'\n\nLaura admitted when selling cars in the past she seems to attract a lot of 'idiots.' She said: 'I posted it the way I did because I honestly hate selling cars due to the amount of idiots it seems to attract.\n\n'So I simply worded the advert in idiot terms and for some reason it just blew up. I had 130 shares which I was shocked about, then it shot up to just under 42,000 shares overnight.\n\n'I rang my brother and just said \"have you seen Facebook?\"He hadn't, so I told him to have a look.\n\n'He hung up to check the post then rang me back. His response was something along the lines of \"how on earth?!\" Followed by \"has it sold more to the point?'\n\nLaura revealed that despite all the attention the car has yet to sell.", "description": "Laura Jones, 26, from Coventry, who is also a supercar instructor and grid girl, was asked by her younger brother to help him sell his Ford Fiesta.
