REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng/File Photo\n\nReuters reported last week that India was considering curbing imports of some Malaysian products, including palm oil, after Kuala Lumpur criticized New Delhi for its actions in Kashmir.\n\nMalaysia is the world\u2019s second-largest producer and exporter of palm oil after Indonesia, and India is Malaysia\u2019s third-largest market for the oil.\n\n\u201cIf the (Indian) government launched a boycott or something like that, then we will have to work diplomatically or reduce the kind of action that they have taken,\u201d Mahathir was quoted as saying by Bernama.\n\nSome Indian traders said refiners had already stopped buying Malaysian palm oil for shipment in November and December, fearing higher import taxes or other measures.\n\nDespite the halt by traders, Malaysia had yet to receive any official statement from the Indian government on the possible restrictions, Mahathir said.\n\n\u201cThis is the reaction from the business community. Hence, we cannot react to their personal decisions,\u201d he said, according to Bernama.\n\nMalaysia on Tuesday said it would consider increasing imports of raw sugar and buffalo meat from India, as it looked to quell trade tensions.\n\nSources had told Reuters that New Delhi was considering curbing imports in response to Mahathir\u2019s remarks at the U.N. general assembly last month, when he said India had \u201cinvaded and occupied\u201d Kashmir, a disputed Muslim-majority region also claimed by Pakistan.\n\nIn August, India stripped its portion of the Kashmir valley of statehood and autonomy, clamped down on communications and carried out mass arrests.", "description": "Malaysia will work diplomatically with India if it decides to restrict imports of Malaysian palm oil, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Wednesday, according to the state news agency Bernama.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441390486&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0HQ", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
