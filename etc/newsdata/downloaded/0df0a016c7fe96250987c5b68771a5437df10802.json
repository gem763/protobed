Bezos apparently hopes that U.S. Congress will find Amazon\u2019s proposed regulations amenable... or otherwise be swayed by its army of lobbyists.\n\nPer Recode:\n\n\u201cOur public policy team is actually working on facial recognition regulations; it makes a lot of sense to regulate that,\u201d Bezos said in response to a reporter\u2019s question. The idea is that Amazon will write its own draft of what it thinks federal legislation should look like, and it will then pitch lawmakers to adopt as much of it as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of something that has really positive uses, so you don\u2019t want to put the brakes on it,\u201d Bezos added. \u201cBut, at the same time, there\u2019s also potential for abuses of that kind of technology, so you do want regulations. It\u2019s a classic dual-use kind of technology.\u201d\n\nBezos sagely added, \u201c[You can] have good things or you can have bad things.\u201d\n\nSurprise appearance by Bezos with surprise announcement about Amazon creating its own draft facial recognition laws to pitch to lawmakers https://t.co/MdWwkWZxgj pic.twitter.com/Rk8skdM3Dp \u2014 Jason Del Rey (@DelRey) September 26, 2019\n\nBezos did not elaborate, according to Recode, but Amazon Vice President of Global Public Policy Michael Punke did publish some ideas on the matter in February 2019 on an Amazon blog.\n\nThese mostly amounted to suggestions that police using the technology use human review of facial recognition results before making arrests, as well as issue transparency reports and post signage where the technology is being used.\n\nThe \u201cdual-use\u201d purpose of facial recognition tech that Bezos is referring to could be less euphemistically compared to the dystopian mass surveillance environment already reportedly emerging under the authoritarian Chinese government. It also does not take a genius to infer that when Bezos mentioned not wanting to \u201cput the brakes on it,\u201d he means putting the brakes on Rekognition.\n\nAmazon has already sold that tech to cops in Oregon and Florida, as well as reportedly pitched it to the fine folks at Immigration and Customs Enforcement who are putting tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants in concentration camps.\n\nThere is ample reason that U.S. Congress might, in fact, want to \u201cput the brakes\u201d on Rekognition and projects like it.\n\nA short list might include Rekognition misidentifying 28 members of U.S. Congress as criminals, reports it is plagued by racial and gender bias, Amazon\u2019s admission it does not and can not control abuse by customers, its seeming plans to integrate the software into home surveillance systems, and the fact that one of its most recent milestones was identifying expressions of terror on people\u2019s faces.\n\nAmazon\u2019s own employees have protested Rekognition and Amazon Web Services\u2019 other contracts with law enforcement. Orlando cops ditched their Rekognition contract after finding it rife with bugs.\n\nThere\u2019s also the inconvenience of the ongoing U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation into Amazon\u2019s business practices, which should make anyone wary of the company\u2019s intentions.\n\nIn any case, letting Amazon write the laws that will govern the use of its own software would be the opposite of unprecedented.\n\nGiven the U.S. government\u2019s track record on regulating Big Tech and the uncertainty of whether that pendulum will ever swing in the other direction, Bezos may find a receptive audience.", "description": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, is hoping that U.S. Congress will take him up on the offer to just let him write any potential facial recognition laws that could interfere with the rollout of Amazon\u2019s Rekognition tech, Recode reported on Thursday....", "authors": ["David Nield", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/d7ak9x1fnsntzghiduge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
