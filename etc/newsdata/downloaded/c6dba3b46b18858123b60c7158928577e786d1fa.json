In the first clip, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) could be seen on screen speaking at a rally, though her voice was muted under the video\u2019s narration.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go make that world,\u201d the narrator said.\n\nVICE referenced Jayapal\u2019s appearance in the video this month while reporting that AT&T had made $14 million from its business ties to ICE this year alone. ICE spent the majority of the money on cellular data and telematic devices provided by AT&T.\n\nJayapal\u2019s inclusion in the company's video was noteworthy, considering Jayapal has been one of the most vocal Democrats in Congress on issues related to ICE. When she first co-introduced legislation to eliminate the agency last year, Jayapal said the U.S. must figure out a way to enforce immigration laws \u201cwithout cruelty and abuse.\u201d\n\nDo you work at ICE or one of the companies that works with them? We want to hear from you. Email Leila Ettachfini from a non-work computer at leila.ettachfini@vice.com.\n\nSoon after VICE\u2019s report, Jayapal\u2019s office reached out to the company about its use of the congresswoman\u2019s image, which the company included without Jayapal\u2019s consent, one of Jayapal's aides told VICE.\n\nAT&T responded by saying it would remove the video and upload a new version that did not feature Jayapal, the aide added.\n\nAT&T has since made the video private on YouTube. Only those with special permissions can view it on the company\u2019s website, although it is still embedded on a page dedicated to AT&T\u2019s self-professed values. The text associated with the video remains there as well.\n\n\u201cStand for equality,\u201d it states. \u201cSpeak with your actions. Whatever a person\u2019s race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, physical ability or other characteristic, we respect and value them. We know that building a greater understanding of our differences makes us stronger.\u201d\n\nAT&T did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.", "description": "Rep.
