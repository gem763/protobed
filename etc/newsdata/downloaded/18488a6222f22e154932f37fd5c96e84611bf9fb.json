He Gets Stuck For 25 Minutes.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alessandra Tarantino/AP Alessandra Tarantino/AP\n\nThe pope was running late.\n\nFor seven excruciating minutes, thousands of gatherers on Sunday in St Peter's Square in Vatican City were anxiously waiting for Pope Francis to show up for his weekly address, which usually starts, like clockwork, exactly at noon. Questions and worries that something may be seriously amiss made many onlookers fret.\n\nBut finally, the window of the Apostolic Palace swung open and a smiling 82-year-old pontiff sent relief across the crowd.\n\nWhat explained the delay? The pope had been trapped in an elevator, an unfazed pontiff told the gatherers.\n\n\"I must apologize for the delay,\" said Francis, explaining that there was a drop of voltage in the elevator, causing it to stop.\n\nFrancis told the crowd he had been trapped in the elevator for 25 minutes, but intervention from firefighters \u2014 whether divine or not \u2014 saved the day.\n\n\"Thank God the Fire Brigade came,\" Francis said. \"Let's hear it for the Fire Brigade!\"\n\nThe pontiff then moved to his usual prayers and blessings. He ended his remarks by announcing that 13 church figures had been elevated to cardinals.\n\nThe Vatican did not clarify whether the pope was alone in the malfunctioning elevator, or if any of his aides were by his side when Francis was stuck.", "description": "Thousands of gatherers on Sunday in St Peter's Square were anxiously waiting for Pope Francis to show up for his weekly address, which usually starts, like clockwork, exactly at noon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/01/ap_19244398093245_wide-20c0d6cebd0473318240f918d0093ea69e33ef51.jpg?s=1400"}
