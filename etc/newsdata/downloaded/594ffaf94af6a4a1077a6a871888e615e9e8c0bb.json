Sheriff Allen says, however, that he\u2019ll be enforcing the law when it takes effect in January 2020. Now, a group of Second Amendment-supporting residents in Humboldt County say they\u2019re launching a campaign to recall the sheriff because he\u2019s not standing up for their rights.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking up a fight against me on something the Legislature has to do, and they think I have the authority not to follow the law,\u201d Allen said in an interview Wednesday with The Nevada Independent. \u201cI do oppose this law. However, it\u2019s my not my job to oppose a law; my job is to enforce the law.\u201d\n\nCommissions in Humboldt County approved a resolution earlier this month declaring the rural northern Nevada a \u201cSecond Amendment Supporting County\u201c, but the language is more vague than what we\u2019ve seen from other counties, where commissioners have actually directed that no public funds will be spent to enforce laws that infringe on the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nDawn Principe, who owns a gun store in Humboldt County, is helping to lead the recall efforts, which have 90 days to gather a little more than 500 signatures in the county of 16,000 people.\n\nAs they collect signatures, Principe says the Humboldt recall group members have been working with Stand Up Nevada, which plans to file to recall Gov. Steve Sisolak for his support of the new gun legislation. The group also is working with Nevadans Citizen Action Network, which is raising money to get an injunction to stop AB291\u2014 the bill that includes the red flag provisions and bans accessories such as high-capacity magazines and bump stocks.\n\nSheriff Allen, meanwhile, says he\u2019s not sure what he can do to address the concerns of residents, because he\u2019s bound to uphold the laws in the state.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking up a fight against me on something the Legislature has to do, and they think I have the authority not to follow the law,\u201d Allen said in an interview Wednesday with The Nevada Independent. \u201cI do oppose this law. However, it\u2019s my not my job to oppose a law; my job is to enforce the law.\u201d\n\nSheriff Allen is right, but he\u2019s also ignoring the fact that law enforcement has a great deal of discretion when it comes to enforcement. In southern Nevada, for example, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo has said his office won\u2019t arrest people who sell small amounts of cannabis, even if they\u2019re unlicensed. Of course, choosing not to enforce a law is a little different than not enforcing a court order. Still, there are other sheriffs around the country, including Weld County, Colorado Sheriff Steve Reams, who say they won\u2019t enforce any \u201cred flag\u201d orders, even if it means facing charges themselves.\n\nIf I were Sheriff Allen I\u2019d be working with other sheriffs around the state, as well as my county commissioners, to ready a legal challenge to Nevada\u2019s \u201cred flag\u201d law once it takes effect. In the meantime, I\u2019d use the existing language of the red flag law to not enforce any search warrants empowering deputies to enter homes and seize firearms. Under the terms of the new law, officers tasked with serving a search warrant and seizing firearms do not have to try to seize the firearms if \u201cthe health or safety of the officer or the adverse party is put at risk because of any action of the adverse party, the law enforcement officer is under no duty to continue to attempt to execute the search warrant and the execution of the warrant shall be deemed unsuccessful.\u201d I\u2019d argue that any attempt to seize someone\u2019s firearms through a \u201cred flag\u201d court order puts the health or safety of officers at risk, and the Sheriff\u2019s office won\u2019t be a party to them.\n\nIt sounds to me like the residents in Humboldt County who are leading the recall efforts want to hear their sheriff talk about how he\u2019s going to fight the law he says opposes, not how he\u2019s going to enforce it. Hopefully we\u2019ll see a united front on the part of several sheriffs and the other \u201cSecond Amendment sanctuary\u201d counties to challenge the red flag law in court, but in the meantime these sheriffs should expect to face judgment of their own in the court of public opinion.", "description": "The sheriff of Humboldt County, Nevada says he has no choice but to enforce the law, and some residents say they have no choice but to recall the sheriff.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/8/1dc8214e-7f55-4d35-afb9-90548667d9a6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
