We never had any interest in Syria's land and sovereignty,\" Erdogan added.\n\nOnce the YPG are removed, Turkish and Russian troops will conduct joint patrols in northern Syria within 10 km of the border, according to the deal.\n\nErdogan added that Ankara would also work with Moscow for the safe return of Syrian refugees now in Turkey.
