Another 31 people were injured.\n\nDuring the fatal accident inquiry, Sheriff Turnbull heard testimony from families, experts and eyewitnesses.\n\nIn his findings, he said there was \"no doubt\" that the crash had happened because the helicopter's engines \"flamed out\" due to a lack of fuel.\n\nThe fuel supply tanks had been depleted because Capt Traill had failed to ensure that at least one of the aircraft's fuel transfer pump switches was on.\n\n\"The central question for the inquiry is why did that happen?\" said Sheriff Turnbull.\n\n\"The answer is a simple one. Capt Traill ignored the low fuel warnings he received.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded\n\nHe said the accident would not have happened if the pilot had followed the normal procedure for dealing with low fuel warnings.\n\nThe Pilot's Checklist stipulated that he should land the aircraft within 10 minutes of a fuel warning.\n\nThe sheriff described Capt Traill's failure to follow that procedure as \"inexplicable\".\n\nHe said: \"Capt Traill took a chance that the low fuel warnings he received were erroneous.\n\n\"That was a conscious decision on his part. It was a decision that had fatal consequences for 10 people.\"\n\nSheriff Turnbull also said that the Eurocopter EC135, manufactured by Airbus, should have had a visible and audible warning which would activate when both fuel transfer pumps had been switched off.\n\nThe pumps, which were both switched off during the flight, supplied fuel from the main tank to the helicopter's twin engines.\n\nImage copyright Crown Office Image caption More than 100 people were inside the bar at the time of the crash\n\nSheriff Turnbull said: \"The circumstances of the accident are so unusual that it is improbable they will be repeated, even without the introduction of the safety actions taken since the accident.\"\n\nHe added that the tragedy \"changed forever the lives of many people\" and praised the dignity of those who attended the 32-day inquiry.\n\nSheriff Turnbull noted it was \"surprising\" that it took two years from the 2015 publication of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report on the crash to confirm that there would be no criminal proceedings.\n\nHe added: \"It took far too long to lodge a notice of inquiry in this case.\"\n\nSheriff Turnbull also observed the Crown Office's Helicopter Incidents Investigation Team were \"not sufficiently resourced\" to enable the FAI to start sooner.\n\nHe also noted that an FAI inquiry into the deaths caused by the Sumburgh helicopter crash in August 2013 was still to be held.\n\nClutha timeline", "description": "A sheriff says the crash happened because Captain David Traill ignored five low fuel warnings during the flight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07sh4kp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
