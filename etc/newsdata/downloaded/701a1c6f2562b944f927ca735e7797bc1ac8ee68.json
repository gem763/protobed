(Image: Ghost Recon Breakpoint)\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed games have gotten better and better at establishing a sense of place and filling that place with tons of satisfying, stealthy missions. After a few hours with Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Kotaku editor-in-chief Stephen Totilo is still mostly just thinking about how much he likes Assassin\u2019s Creed. On this week\u2019s Kotaku Splitscreen, we talk about his initial impressions of Ubisoft\u2019s latest, as well as the other stealth-focused open world games that he loves.\n\nFirst up, Kirk and I discuss the games we\u2019re playing. I\u2019m still on Fire Emblem: Three Houses but also tried two new tabletop games: Escape from Aliens in Outer Space and Sheriff of Nottingham. Kirk\u2019s tabletop group is still playing Betrayal Legacy, and Kirk is also playing the new Hitman level and Destiny 2: Shadowkeep.\n\nAfter a break (28:32), we bring on Stephen to talk about Ghost Recon Breakpoint, open world games, and how much we all love sidequests. We close with off-topic discussion (1:08:15) about Elementary, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Can You Ever Forgive Me? and Kirk\u2019s music pick.\n\nGet the MP3 here, or read an excerpt below.\n\nThere was a surprise update to Ghost Recon Wildlands, the one set in Bolivia that came out in 2017, earlier this year. Suddenly they\u2019re like, \u201cThere\u2019s this other Ghost,\u201d which is what the special agents in the Ghost Recon universe are called, and it\u2019s the Jon Bernthal character, whose name is escaping me right now, unfortunately.\n\nHe shows up and he has a mission for you, and you do a few things. They didn\u2019t say it flat-out at the moment, but within a couple days, they revealed that this was actually a tease for Breakpoint.\n\nThey\u2019ve been doing that now, where Ubisoft games will get this last-minute DLC or something. Division 1 did it for Division 2. I was speculating earlier this week on Kotaku that Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey hasn\u2019t really had its final update and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if next year they start teasing the next one of those.\n\nSo anyway, his group of Ghosts have overtaken the island. So, as opposed to the previous game where you go in with three AI buddies and you guys are all going through, doing the stealth shooting tactical stuff \u2014 it can be co-op if you prefer, instead of AI \u2014 you are solo in this one.\n\nI mean, you can co-op, but there\u2019s no other human characters by default. It\u2019s just you and your drone. More survival aspects. You can get tired, you have to drink water. You can bivouac, you can set it afire. And if you eat, you have a little bit of extra stat boost, I forget which type, the next time you go back into action. But if you read a book, a little handbook that you have, you can get more XP.\n\nMaddy: You become emotionally fulfilled, and then going back into action isn\u2019t as daunting.\n\nKirk: You engage your imagination!\n\nStephen: With literature that you\u2019re reading? No, it\u2019s tactical notes. It\u2019s the Clancy-verse, that\u2019s what you\u2019d be reading about.\n\nKirk: \u201cHow To Skin A Snake, And Eat It.\u201d\n\nStephen: Exactly. But basically, you\u2019ve got big skill trees, like you had in the previous game. They\u2019ve gone more heavy on the loot and the collecting, which can suspiciously be monetized. Weapon blueprints, all kinds of scored statistic-based armours that you can get, all of which you\u2019re constantly collecting and harvesting or whatever and can then get from an in-game shop.\n\nSome of the stuff you can buy optionally from the microtransactions shop instead. Although, I don\u2019t feel like you need to do any of that. It always has that question, though, of have they built in some of the grind?\n\nIt\u2019s open in terms of what you do. You can go after the main dude right away. Heather Alexandra\u2019s gonna review the game for us and she\u2019s trying to do that.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to do that Ganon in Breath of the Wild-style, go in your underwear and try to take him down with a stick. But she ran into a tank, so it\u2019s not working out so well.\n\nOtherwise, you can try to take down these various Ghosts that have gone rogue, who are on the island, or you can try to do other quests that are on the island. It seems like it could be interesting. It\u2019s a huge, vast world, I just haven\u2019t explored enough of it.\n\nLike Wildlands, the main character is this blank slate. The writing is pretty wooden so far. The whole thing is surprisingly austere. You have some Ubisoft games that have a lot of personality to them, more like the Far Cry games, some of the Assassin\u2019s Creeds or the Rayman games.\n\nKirk: Watch Dogs.\n\nStephen: But then you have these games that are much more stripped down, like Steep, which was pretty antiseptic. I would say Wildlands to an extent was like that, and I\u2019m getting some of that from Breakpoint too.\n\nKirk: Didn\u2019t Steep have the mountain that started talking to you sometimes? It was like this one weird flash of colour in an otherwise very beige game.\n\nI have a couple of questions. First of all, John Bernthal\u2019s name is Colonel Cole D. Walker.\n\nStephen: Oh yeah! Cole Walker! I just needed to think of some generic words. Cole Walker, that makes sense.\n\nKirk: Someone should just make a huge list of all the \u201caction man\u201d names that have ever existed. There are so many, and they\u2019re all very good. So, questions that I have. First of all, how\u2019s the gameplay? What is it like, in general, to go to an outpost of dudes and shoot the dudes?\n\nStephen: It\u2019s great, Kirk. [laughs] What a weird question. What is it like to go to a base and shoot the dudes?\n\nKirk: Love shootin\u2019 the dudes. I mean, that\u2019s what you do in the game, right?\n\nMaddy: How does it feel? How\u2019s the gunplay? Feel good? Feel powerful?\n\nKirk: Snuffing a man\u2019s life out? Watching him die?\n\nMaddy: [laughs] That is the game, though, right?\n\nStephen: As both of you know \u2014 listeners may not know \u2014 I play games in a strange way. One of the things I do is I spend too much time in menus trying to understand systems instead of just diving right into the gameplay.\n\nMaddy: You haven\u2019t actually shot anyone in the entire game yet.\n\nKirk: \u201cI have a really good understanding of the microtransaction store, but haven\u2019t really shot too many people\u2014\u201d\n\nStephen: They\u2019ve thrown this very weird version of a battle pass into it. I\u2019ve been interested in some of the quest structure and stuff like that. What I found is that I can\u2019t play it the way I played the previous game, which was the way I try to manage Kotaku, and the way that I most like playing an Assassin\u2019s Creed game.\n\nKirk: Shoot people from a distance?\n\nStephen: Point and have other people do the awesome stuff.\n\nMaddy: While you\u2019re doing sidequests that may or may not be relevant? Or is that too real?\n\nStephen: [laughs] Right. My favourite moment in any Assassin\u2019s Creed game is in Brotherhood or whatever, where you have that posse of assassins and you\u2019re just walking down the street all suave as Ezio.\n\nThen you just press that button to whistle and then suddenly your assassin brother or minions, whatever, jump off of a rooftop or out of a haystack and stab a person to death. And you just keep walking down the street without breaking a stride.\n\nThey\u2019ve taken that away from Assassin\u2019s Creed games, but what I liked in Wildlands is that you could, with either your character\u2019s sights with the gun or with the drone that you can fly into the air at any moment, you could tag up to three targets, and then you could either pull the trigger while shooting one enemy and then your three buddies would automatically shoot the other three targets.\n\nOr, you could not fire a shot at all, you just press the button and the three targets you tag would all be killed by your three buddies. You could do this in a super-stealthy way where you were never exposing yourself to danger, other than to just surveil, spot, and then say, \u201cOK, tag them, take them out.\u201d\n\nFor me, that was the best way to remain stealthy in that game, and I enjoyed playing it that way. Then I would take things on myself if the action got too hairy, or whatever.\n\nIn this case... you don\u2019t have the AI buddies yet, they\u2019re coming as I think free DLC. You instead are relying on your drone to fly around and zap each person that you tag. They\u2019ve made it an item, an expendable item, so you only get three sync shots and you have to collect more.\n\nSo, it\u2019s forcing me to do more direct engagement, actually sneaking up on enemies. I would actually say they\u2019re correcting for the way that I was playing. Sometimes you can object to that \u2014 \u201cThe developers should go the way the players go\u201d \u2014 but I feel like it\u2019s good and healthy that I\u2019m being incentivised to use my stealth skills.", "description": "Assassin\u2019s Creed games have gotten better and better at establishing a sense of place and filling that place with tons of satisfying, stealthy missions.
