She had a daughter in 1999, but the baby was taken away from her and sold to an animal park in China.\n\nHer legal victory brought international fame to the orangutan, and set a precedent for apes to be legally deemed people rather than property.\n\nBubbles\n\nUntil this week - nearly five years later - Sandra remained at the site of the zoo, which closed in 2016 following reports of animal cruelty. The zoo is now being rebuilt as an \"eco-park\" with improved living standards for animals.\n\nAn Argentine court approved her transfer to Florida's Center for Great Apes in 2017, though her journey was delayed by applications for US permits.\n\nThe 100-acre sanctuary is home to chimpanzees and orangutans which have been freed from circuses, labs, zoos and private collections. Michael Jackson's former pet chimpanzee, Bubbles, is among several famous residents.\n\nSandra will join 21 other orangutans, and will be free to move between 11 outdoor areas where the great apes live.\n\n\"We're eager to meet her, she's a lovely orangutan\" said Patti Ragan, the Center's founder.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Ms Ragan said she was happy that Sandra's story was bringing public attention to orangutans, one of the world's most endangered animals.\n\nBut she added that the sanctuary was working to ensure this heightened publicity wouldn't impact on Sandra's transition into her new home.\n\n\"We don't want any distractions,\" said Ms Ragan. \"We just want her to have peace when she gets here\".", "description": "Lawyers for Sandra the orangutan won a landmark appeal in 2014 which deemed her a \"nonhuman person\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9754/production/_109004783_3cc0afb1-113b-4fde-9d98-f2b235e108f8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
