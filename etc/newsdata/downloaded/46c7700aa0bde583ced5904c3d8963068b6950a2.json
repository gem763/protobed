However, his plans were scuppered due to Whitney\u2019s conflicted feelings over ex-fianc\u00e9 Callum \u2018Halfway\u2019 Highway (Tony Clay). Now \u2014 knowing that Callum will be a problem \u2014 evil Leo seemigly has plans to remove him from the equation.\n\nAfter discovering Callum had cheated on her with Ben (Max Bowden), Whitney was left devastated and thus headed off on her honeymoon on her own. Upon her return to Walford, it became apparent that she\u2019d had a whirlwind holiday romance, and viewers were shocked to discover that her new beau was none other than Leo \u2014 the son of paedophile Tony (Chris Coghill).\n\nOver the last few weeks, Leo has attempted to get closer to Whitney, and he\u2019s succeeded in doing so thus far, but tonight, he encountered an obstacle \u2014 and a pretty big one at that \u2014 as Whitney\u2019s feelings for Callum came to the forefront once more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeo surprised Whitney at E20 and, as a result, the pair had a drink together. Problems ensued rather quickly, as Callum and Ben arrived \u2014 evidently on a date \u2014 and Whitney\u2019s mood changed as a result. Nonetheless, Leo upped his game, as he quizzed Whitney about her exes, but she became overly emotional \u2014 and just as he was getting her to open up about Tony \u2014 a worried Callum approached to see if she was alright.\n\nLeo was fuming that Callum ruined his moment \u2014 but Whitney didn\u2019t mind, and thus she sent Leo to get her another drink. Leo knew instantly that Callum was going to be thorn in his side, as with him looking out for Whitney \u2014 not to mention her still harbouring feelings for him \u2014 getting close to her was going to be particularly tricky.\n\nWhitney attempted to kiss Callum, but he pulled away, informing her that he loves her only as a friend. An emotional Whitney then revealed that she feels as if she doesn\u2019t fit in anywhere, and Callum \u2014 sweet as ever \u2014 told her that simply isn\u2019t the case at all, but rather everyone else needs to fit in with her.\n\nTouched, Whitney decided to call it a night. Leo glared at Callum \u2014 the disdain apparent in his eyes \u2014 as he carried her out of E20. Before exiting the premises, Whitney informed Leo she\u2019s not ready for another relationship,\n\nThe episode came to a conclusion as a disgruntled Leo scrolled through Whitney\u2019s social media, before stopping at image of her and Callum from happier days. With Callum\u2019s full name on display in the picture, Leo stared at the phone screen \u2014 a plan seemingly forming in his head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCallum\u2019s going to be a problem for Leo for sure, so Leo will no doubt set about removing him from the picture \u2014 or, at the very least, from Whitney\u2019s mind.\n\nThe question is: how will he go about doing so? And what length is he willing to go to in order to carry out his plan?\n\nEastEnders continues on Monday 21st October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: A dark new storyline is revealed for Ben Mitchell as he takes revenge\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Martin Fowler in serious danger \u2014 but will he die?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "After his date with Whitney ended in disaster thanks to Callum, Leo set about seeking revenge.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/leo-king-and-callum-highway-in-eastenders_1571401389.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
