But it does not, as is sometimes thought, mean the heart stops \u00adaltogether. It signifies that the muscle is damaged and can no longer pump enough blood to meet the body\u2019s needs.\n\nThis condition, which \u00adaffects 1 in 5 adults \u2014 usually in the later years \u2014 can shorten life. But with proper treatment, people are living longer and better with heart failure.\n\n\u201cWe have more medications at our disposal today to improve quality of life for people with a weakened heart,\u201d says Guy L. Mintz, director of cardiovascular health and lipidology at Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.\n\nHere\u2019s what to do.\n\nTake preventive steps\n\nCoronary artery disease and heart attacks are major causes of heart failure, says cardiologist Tamara Horwich, medical director of UCLA\u2019s Cardiac Rehabilitation Program in Los Angeles. Managing your risk for problems \u2014 such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and Type 2 diabetes \u2014 that could lead to such conditions is the best way to protect the heart muscle from injury.\n\nPhysical activity five or more days a week and a healthy, plant-based diet are key. \u201cFocus on eating lots of vegetables and fruits [five or more daily servings] and limiting processed foods,\u201d Horwich says. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes, taking medication as prescribed could also cut heart failure risks, she says.\n\nKnow the signs\n\n\u201cHeart failure is a constellation of signs and symptoms that the heart is no longer pumping as it should be,\u201d Mintz says.\n\nCommon symptoms include shortness of breath during activity, such as going up and down stairs; swelling in the lower limbs or abdomen; and trouble breathing while lying flat. You may feel the need to prop yourself up with pillows to sleep.\n\nIf you experience such symptoms, see your primary care doctor, Horwich says. The physician may recommend tests such as a chest X-ray to look for fluid in the lungs and an electrocardiogram (EKG) to evaluate your heart\u2019s electrical activity. A cardiologist may confirm a weakened heart muscle via echocardiogram (ECG), which shows how well your heart pumps blood.\n\nManage the symptoms\n\nHeart failure usually can\u2019t be cured, but you may be able to alleviate symptoms by following your medication regimen and making lifestyle changes. So:\n\n\u25cf Quit smoking. Doing so can lower blood pressure and heart rate almost imme\u00addi\u00adately, which can ease shortness of breath.\n\n\u25cf Eat right. Stick to a diet rich in fresh fruits and veggies, whole grains, low-fat dairy, lean meat, fish, nuts, and legumes. Reduce your intake of processed food.\n\n\u25cf Watch your sodium. Though most \u00adexperts advise a low-sodium diet for heart failure, it has been neither proved nor disproved to cut symptoms. But salt helps the body retain fluid. \u201cIf you have a lot of congestive symptoms, such as swelling in your legs and feet, limiting your sodium intake to around 2,000 mg per day may help,\u201d Horwich says.\n\n\u25cf Get physical activity. It helps \u00adto reduce your heart\u2019s workload. Ask your doctor whether you might benefit from a formal exercise-based cardiac rehab program, which might be covered by insurance.\n\nKeep up with your meds\n\nTo keep symptoms at bay, it\u2019s essential to take your medications as recommended, and on time. For systolic heart failure (the heart pumps with too little force), meds might include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which open blood vessels and reduce blood pressure, or a newer combination drug, sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto).\n\nMeds for people with diastolic heart failure, where the heart can\u2019t relax enough to fill with blood between pumps, may include beta-blockers, to slow heart rate and decrease the strength of heart contractions.\n\nIn both cases, your doctor may also prescribe diuretics to reduce extremity swelling and fluid in the lungs.\n\nCopyright 2019, Consumer Reports Inc.\n\nRead More\n\nHeart disease progress is slowing or stalling, study says.
