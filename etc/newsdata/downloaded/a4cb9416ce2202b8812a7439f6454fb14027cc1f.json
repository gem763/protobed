News' \"Daily Pop\" show where he was promoting his new clothing, and during the segment, titled \"Shaquille O'Neal Shoots His Shot With 'Daily Pop' Guest Host Rocsi,\" O'Neal couldn't stop making flirtatious comments toward Rocsi Diaz, 35.\n\nIt all started when O'Neal, 47, was asked by co-host Carissa Culiner to show off his best modeling skills and share a \"little flirty fun\" for the cameras, which prompts O'Neal to stare and make \"eyebrow raises\" as well as \"call me\" gestures to Diaz.\n\n'SHARK IN THE CAGE' SHAQ PULLED FROM WATER AFTER PREDATOR WIGGLES THROUGH BARS OF ENCLOSURE\n\n\"I'm lost,\" Diaz said while laughing, before calling one of his looks \"sad and pouty.\"\n\n\u201cI could never be sad and pouty with you sitting there,\u201d O'Neal responded, before adding: \u201cShe\u2019s always in my DM\u2019s I just wanted you to know that.\"\n\n\u201cOh my god,\" a flustered Diaz said. \"Let's tell the truth.\"\n\nO'Neal, who was clearly trying to provoke a reaction, told Culiner that he couldn't tell her \"some of the things\" Diaz says, before claiming: \"You know what she says? She says, \u2018Even though I\u2019m Spanish, you know I like that chocolate\u2019. For real.\"\n\nSOPHIE TURNER'S FLIRTY COMMENT ON JOE JONAS' MAGAZINE PICTURE DRIVES FANS WILD\n\n\u201cAnd I tell her, \u2018Once you go Shaq, you never go back,'\" he added.\n\nDiaz let out a laugh before telling O'Neal to, again, \"tell the truth\" about their social media exchanges. The TV personality went on to explain that she messaged O'Neal to let him know that she'd be interviewing him and to \"make [her] look good.\"\n\n\"You did not tell me that... She didn't tell me,\" stated O'Neal, before commenting that Diaz owed him a date for not giving him a heads up.\n\n'BACHELORETTE' STAR MIKE JOHNSON LEAVES FLIRTY COMMENT ON DEMI LOVATO'S BIKINI SNAP\n\nAt the end of the interview, O'Neal laughed and confessed: \"I'm just playing, America. I'm just playing, America.\"\n\nThe interview left fans divided, with some criticizing O'Neal's behavior.\n\n\"Shaq\u2019s incessant flirting is making me uncomfortable. Let Rocsi work in peace. #dailypop,\" one person stated. \"Honestly, this was awkward and cringey,\" commented another individual.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile others thought O'Neal's comments were all in good fun. \"He was doing a flirty fun impressions, it was innocent,\" said one person.\n\nEchoed another: \"I watched this interview and it was all in fun.
