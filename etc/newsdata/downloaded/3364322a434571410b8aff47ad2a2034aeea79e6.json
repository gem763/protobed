By this measurement, workers in the highest-earning industries in San Jose and San Francisco struggle to afford median-priced homes, spending more than $200 a month on housing costs than they should.\n\nWhile these Silicon Valley metros are the only places where the estimated monthly housing payment for a median-priced home exceeds affordability standards, several other cities come close. The monthly payment was calculated assuming a 20% down payment and mortgage with a 4.25% interest rate.\n\nThe highest-paid workers in 10 other metro areas have less than $800 a month left over after covering housing costs, assuming they own a median-priced home, according to the LendingTree report.\n\nAn important note: Income figures used in this analysis are from 2017 and represent the median salary of an individual working in that industry, not the total income of a household. A dual-income household could likely afford a higher monthly payment. You can find the full methodology here.\n\nBelow are the metro areas where typical workers in the highest-paid industries \u2014 most commonly legal, architecture and engineering, and computers and mathematics \u2014 have the narrowest margin between what they can comfortably afford and what they likely pay for a home.", "description": "In some expensive housing markets, it can still be a stretch for even the highest earners to comfortably afford a home, a LendingTree report found.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8136e62e22af5d1d4cd178-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
