Urtula, also a Boston College student, jumped from the top of a parking garage at a Boston hotel on the morning of his graduation. His girlfriend of 18 months watched, prosecutors said.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins said the couple exchanged 75,000 text messages in the two months leading up to Urtula's death. She said 47,000 were sent from You to Urtula including perhaps \"thousands\" urging him to kill himself. Urtula's family was in town to attend his graduation when he died.\n\n\"Many of the messages clearly display the power dynamic in the relationship where Ms. You made demands and threats with the understanding that she had complete control over Mr. Urtula, both mentally and emotionally,\" Rollins said.\n\nNew law proposed: 'Conrad's Law' proposed in Massachusetts in response to Michelle Carter suicide texting case\n\nYou is currently in her native South Korea, Rollins said. She said authorities will look to extradite her to the United States if she does not voluntarily turn herself in. A grand jury returned the indictment charging You on Oct. 18.\n\nUSA TODAY was unable to immediately reach You or her attorney for comment.\n\nRollins said You's abuse was physical, verbal and psychological. She said You was aware of Urtula's \"spiraling depression and suicidal thoughts brought on by her abuse \u2013 yet she persisted, continuing to encourage him to take his own life.\"\n\nHer texts, according to prosecutors, included repeated abusive remarks for Urtula to \u201cgo kill himself\u201d to \u201cgo die\u201d and that she, his family and the world would be better off without him.\n\nThe new charge drew immediate comparisons to the high-profile case involving Carter, also in Massachusetts, who was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the 2014 suicide death of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III. Carter, who is serving 15 months in prison, was found guilty of pressuring Roy to kill himself in repeated text messages.\n\nRollins said You was tracking Urtula's location on the morning of his suicide, \"as she frequently did,\" on her phone. She said You went to the parking garage and was present when Urtula jumped to his death.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins More\n\n\"Abuse became more frequent and more powerful and more demeaning in the days and hours leading up to Mr. Urtula's untimely death,\" Rollins said. \"The abuse was witnessed by family and classmates of both parties and documented extensively in text messages between Ms. You and Mr. Urtula and in Mr. Urtula's journal entries.\"\n\nShe added: \"Students come to Boston from around the world to attend our renowned colleges and universities, eager to learn and experience our vibrant city. Their families and loved ones certainly do not expect them to face unending physical and mental abuse.\"\n\nCarter, now 22, was denied early release by the Massachusetts Parole Board in September. She's been in prison since February after being convicted in 2017.\n\nA strange connection: Suicide texting case: HBO film shows bizarre connection between Michelle Carter and 'Glee'\n\nRollins said there are \"similarities, of course\" with the Carter case but called it a \"separate and distinct case.\"", "description": "A former Boston College student was charged in connection with the suicide death of her boyfriend, drawing comparisons to the Michelle Carter case.", "authors": ["Joey Garrison", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iTMt9ZiTGdZ8hBxQb.6M3g--~B/aD01NzI7dz04NzM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/079dd062b926bfad19bcffff0c295881", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
