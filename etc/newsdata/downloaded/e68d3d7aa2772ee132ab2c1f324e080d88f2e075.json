Strictly Come Dancing fans pointed out Motsi Mabuse's 'fuming' reaction as Catherine Tyldesley and her professional partner Johannes Radebe were booted off the show on Sunday\n\nWhen the decision to save the presenter was announced, judges Shirley and Bruno Tonioli were seen clapping, while German-based dancer Motsi and Craig Revel Horwood engaged in a conversation instead.\n\nCatherine and Johannes performed their Cha Cha once again at the end of the show's Halloween Week, after scraping the bottom of the leaderboard with a score of 24 out of a possible 40.\n\nTaking to Twitter in their droves, viewers spotted the media personality's visible reaction, with 2017 Strictly contestant Chizzy Akudolu penning: 'Motsi is all of us right now... @MOTSI_MABUSE @jojo_radebe @Cath_Tyldesley #Strictly.' [sic]\n\nAnother added: 'Seconded. I am so cross about it. Motsi looked like she was fuming! Plus, are they marking up some and down others?

Shirley has hated Catherine since the start and had it in for her. Shirley needs her head testing! ITS A FIX - Mike can p**s off and so can Katya!'\n\nSomeone else raged: 'Have the judges been told to keep the BBC personality in? Catherine has been good each week, certainly better than Mike and had more potential. Poor and unfair decision in my opinion!'\n\n'What a fix!! MIKE BUSHELL?! What a load of s***e! You've ruined this year's competition for thousands of people including me and my mother!'\n\n'Motsi is all of us right now': Viewers didn't hold back sharing their thoughts on the show's latest edition\n\nMailOnline has contacted a BBC spokesperson and Mike's representatives for comment.\n\nMike defiantly appeared on BBC Breakfast to defend himself, already at rehearsals for his next dance.\n\nHe said: 'It's an entertainment show, we're all trying our best, you're not really competing against anybody else, you compete against yourself to try and learn to get better and better each week, even if its just learning a couple of new steps.\n\n'As a non-dancer all I can do is put the hours in, do my best and get through it. You have to rise above the abuse on social media, that's one of the sad things about social media.\n\nUproar: Fans slammed the outcome of Sunday's show\n\n'All you can do is do your best, accept the judges' decision and move on. Johannes and Catherine are lovely people, I didn't want to see them go but someone has to go.\n\n'It's like football - you have to accept the referee's decision. [The judges] are the best judges in the world, they do know what they're talking about, if they'd sent me home that would have been the best decision, I can't get involved in any of that.\n\n'I just have to concentrate on improving, and if Katya is happy with what I'm doing then I'm happy.'\n\nMoving on: On Monday, host Mike and his wife Emily (pictured earlier this year) hit back at trolls on Twitter who slammed the BBC Breakfast host after he was saved\n\nBiting back: 'Wow the abuse!
