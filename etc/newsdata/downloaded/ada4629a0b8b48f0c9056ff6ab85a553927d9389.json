Brace for lengthy delays", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Steve Levy went online to renew his Global Entry membership the second he found out his favorite airport fast pass had expired.\n\nThat was in early May. Four months later, the Seattle nonprofit director is still waiting. The $100 fee for the five-year membership showed up on his American Express bill several statements ago, but his Global Entry account still says \"pending review.''\n\n\"I'm stuck in the 'waiting for confirmation' black hole,'' Levy said. And stuck in the regular airport security lanes on every flight he's taken since May.\n\nGlobal Entry, a trusted traveler program from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that provides travelers with a speedier trip through customs when returning from international flights, also includes TSA PreCheck, a sister trusted traveler program. PreCheck allows passengers to go through a dedicated, usually quicker, security lane where they can keep shoes and coats on and leave laptops and approved liquids in their carry-on bags.\n\n\"Now I have to use three bins,'' Levy said. \"It's such a hassle. It's just ridiculous.''\n\nLevy's situation is not unique. Between 30% and 35% of Global Entry applications and renewals are taking 90 days or more to complete, a CBP spokesman told USA TODAY. The rest, he said, are completed within 15 days. (Full disclosure: My renewal took less than two weeks in late May.)\n\nIn a hard-to-find statement on its website, the agency warns applicants to expect \"significant delays'' in processing times \u2013 up to 100 days \u2013 and limited appointment times at enrollment centers. Travelers applying for Global Entry for the first time are required to do an in-person interview as are some travelers renewing their memberships.\n\nThe cited reasons on the website for the backlog: the 35-day government shutdown that ended in late January and the \"ongoing humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border.''\n\nTo offset the loss of some airport employees to the southwest border, the spokesman said, the agency has moved some workers from its Global Entry enrollment centers to frontline airport operations. CBP officers screen visitors and residents flying into the United States from abroad.\n\nAnother factor extending processing times: a spike in renewals due to a high volume of expirations. Global Entry memberships began to spike in late 2013 when PreCheck expanded to the general public and travelers weighed which security fast pass to buy. Global Entry, which also includes expedited customs processing upon arrival from international flights, is $100 for five years; PreCheck is $85.\n\nGiven the delays, CBP has extended the amount of time Global Entry members will retain their benefits, including PreCheck, past the expiration date as they await renewal. It is now a year instead of six months. The only caveat: You have to renew your membership before it expires.\n\nAn explainer: What's the difference between Global Entry, TSA Precheck and Clear?\n\nLove TSA PreCheck and Global Entry? Check your expiration date\n\nLevy jokes that he should get a prize since his wait time is now over the \"up to 100 days'' estimate on the agency's website.\n\nBut he's not laughing at the situation. Levy was so frustrated he appealed to his congresswoman, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.) in early August. Her office looked into it and was simply reminded about the extended processing times posted on the agency's website. The office was also asked by CBP officials to \"discontinue inquiries based on extended (Global Entry) processing times,'' according to an email sent to Levy.\n\nLevy wants to know why he simply can't keep his coveted TSA PreCheck benefits while his renewal application \"flounders in bureaucracy.'' (He would have had he started his renewal before it expired.)\n\nPolitical connections might not help. Cindy McCain, wife of late Sen. John McCain of Arizona was caught up in the delays earlier this year. In a post on Twitter, she said she put in her renewal online in late March and was still waiting two months later.\n\n\"Why is this taking so long?'' she said.", "description": "The Global Entry trusted traveler program has been plagued by lengthy application delays.
