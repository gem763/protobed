It was a kitchen explosion in Windows on the World. Nobody really knew what happened,\" Trump said, recalling \"great confusion\".\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut like so many Trump anecdotes, what he claims to have happened doesn't match the facts. Within 30 seconds of CNBC cutting to a live picture of smoke billowing out of the World Trade Center's North tower that morning, anchor Mark Haines was told that a source who worked in the towers had reported a plane crashing into the building as the cause.\n\nAt no point in time does Haines or anyone who was on-air with him mention the possibility of a boiler fire or an explosion at Windows on the World, the restaurant on the tower's top floor.\n\nTrump also repeated something today that he has said on numerous occasions over the years, most recently at a July signing ceremony for legislation to renew the federal 9/11 victims' compensation fund: he claimed to have gone to the site of the fallen towers to help.\n\n\"Soon after, I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could,\" he said.\n\nTrump said he \"spent a lot of time\" with 9/11 first responders at that July ceremony, but retired New York Fire Department Deputy Chief Richard Alles contradicted these claims in an interview with the New York Times.\n\n\u201cI spent many months there myself, and I never witnessed him,\u201d said Alles, who attended the July event. \u201cHe was a private citizen at the time. I don\u2019t know what kind of role he could have possibly played.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, as first responders desperately searched for fallen colleagues in the burning rubble of the collapsed Twin Towers, the man who would become the 45th president called into a local TV station \u2014 Seacaucus, New Jersey's WWOR \u2014 for an interview with anchors Brenda Blackmon and Rolland Smith.\n\nAsked if the towers' collapse, which killed 2,606 people and destroyed the entire World Trade Center site, had damaged his nearby office tower at 40 Wall Street, Trump prefaced his answer with a mention of the height of his building.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
