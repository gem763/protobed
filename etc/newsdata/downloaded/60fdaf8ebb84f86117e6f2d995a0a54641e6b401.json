The award is the largest in WTO history, nearly doubling the previous record set in 2002.\n\nThe long-awaited ruling comes as Trump had been looking to step up his trade war with the EU, having already hit the trade bloc with 25% tariff on steel and has threatened a $75 billion tariff on autos from Europe.\n\nThe tariffs would be the latest escalation in a decades-long standoff over EU-based Airbus and US-based Boeing, with each government claiming that the aircraft companies are illicitly aided by government funds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker have been locked in a broader trade dispute for more than a year, but progress toward a long-term agreement has proven challenging.\n\nIn a statement, the WTO said, \"the United States may request authorization from the DSB to take countermeasures with respect to the European Union and certain member States, at a level not exceeding, in total, $7,496.623 million annually.\"\n\nAirbus traded more than 1% lower on the news, while Boeing dropped 2.5%.\n\nIn 2004, the Bush administration accused the EU of illegally subsidizing Airbus with $22 billion worth of cash. Subsequently, the EU accused the US of doing the same, subsidizing Boeing with $23 billion illegally.\n\nIn 2011, the WTO ruled that both companies had been given unlawful assistance from the opposing governments.\n\nThe WTO ruling now means that goods such as cheese, linen and swordfish will become more expensive to export to the US, as well as aircraft part prices going up.\n\nAirbus' CEO recently said that the trade war between the EU and the US would be a \"lose-lose game,\" arguing that neither side will benefit from the hikes in tariffs.\n\nThe EU's own hike in tariffs will be ruled upon by the WTO early next year so it will be a while until the trade bloc can match Trump's trade war.\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley says WeWork's failed IPO marks the end of an era for unprofitable unicorns \u2014 and explains why it leaves the market's tech kingpins vulnerable", "description": "The World Trade Organization on Wednesday gave the Trump administration the green light to slap roughly $7.5 billion worth of tariffs on goods coming from...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d949c1541753201fd61898e-2000/rtsz76z.jpg"}
