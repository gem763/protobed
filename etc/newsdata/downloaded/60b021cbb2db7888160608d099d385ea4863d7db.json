As a teen, he would fuel his passion for technology and earn extra cash buying and selling gadgets online. But it was a lesson learned in his early twenties from enterprising icons Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey that set him on course for the big times. That lesson? Know your mission. Quek is co-founder and CEO of $550 million online consumer marketplace Carousell.

For Carousell, that meant building a platform to simplify buying and selling online, which, Quek said, plays into the company's wider mission to \"inspire every person in the world to start selling.\"\n\nYou've just got to love what you do and be obsessed about that problem you're solving Siu Rui Quek co-founder and CEO, Carousell", "description": "Carousell founder Siu Rui Quek had always been entrepreneurial.
