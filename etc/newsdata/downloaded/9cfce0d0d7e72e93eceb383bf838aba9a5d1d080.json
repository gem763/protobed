We look back at history and ask: Will they do it again? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nA hacker linked to the Iran government made more than 2,700 attempts to target email addresses belonging to a 2020 U.S. presidential campaign, government officials, journalists and prominent Iranians living abroad, the tech giant Microsoft said Friday.\n\nThe company said that four email accounts were compromised by the group it calls \u201cPhosphorous\u201d but none of those compromised accounts were associated with a presidential campaign or current U.S. government officials.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has notified the customers related to these investigations and threats and has worked as requested with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them,\u201d Tom Burt, Microsoft vice president for customer security and trust, wrote in a blog post.\n\nA company spokesman declined to identify which campaign or individuals Phosphorous targeted, but Reuters and the New York Times reported Friday that the hack targeted President Donald Trump's reelection campaign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump. (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP)\n\nTim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman for President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, initially declined to comment on whether it was targeted in the newly-revealed Iran-linked attack. But Murtaugh later added that the campaign has \"no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.\"\n\nThe targeted attacks come while anxiety about Russian interference in the 2016 election has not receded.\n\nIn March 2016, two cyber units of the Russian military agency called \"GRU\" sent hundreds of spear-phishing emails to email addresses associated with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The spear-phishing campaign allowed them to gain access to John Podesta's email accounts. Podesta was Clinton's campaign chairman.\n\nThe group WikiLeaks release more than 20,000 emails and other documents stolen from the hacks, three days before the Democratic National Convention. WikiLeaks then released more than 50,000 documents stolen from Podesta's personal email account in the month leading up to Election Day 2016.\n\nCampaign officials with former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders and author Marianne Williamson declined to comment, citing policies of not discussing security matters.\n\nIan Sams, a spokesman for the campaign of Democratic White House hopeful Kamala Harris, said the campaign has received \"no indication that our campaign is the one Microsoft referenced or that we have been targeted by this attack.\n\n\"But we have taken appropriate steps since the beginning of our campaign to protect ourselves against hacking attempts and will continue to do so,\" Sams added.\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock's and former Rep. Joe Sestak's campaigns confirmed they were not targeted. Dennis Willard with Rep. Tim Ryan's presidential campaign said they \"have no reason to believe that we were hacked.\"\n\nOfficials for the campaigns of Elizabeth Warren, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, as well as 9 low-polling Democratic candidates did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMicrosoft says Phosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over targeted accounts.\n\n\u201cFor example, they would seek access to a secondary email account linked to a user\u2019s Microsoft account, then attempt to gain access to a user\u2019s Microsoft account through verification sent to the secondary account,\u201d Burt said. \u201cIn some instances, they gathered phone numbers belonging to their targets and used them to assist in authenticating password resets.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft said it decided to publicize the hack, which it described as \"not technically sophisticated,\" because it felt it's increasingly important for the government and private sector to be transparent about nation-state attacks and attempts to disrupt democratic processes.\n\nThe company added that publishing the information would also help other organization\u2019s associated with election processes to be more vigilant.\n\nIran\u2019s is lesser known among U.S. adversaries for its cyberattack capabilities. Tehran\u2019s most notable suspected cyberattacks targeted Israel, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and U.S. in 2010 following a collaborative attack against Iran\u2019s nuclear program by the U.S. and Israel.\n\n\u201cThis series of attacks is notable for their lack of sophistication. The attackers didn\u2019t try to crack passwords or engage in phishing attacks,\u201d said Mike Chapple, associate teaching professor of IT, analytics, and operations at the University of Notre Dame, \u201cInstead, they took advantage of Microsoft\u2019s password recovery mechanisms, attempting to take over the secondary email accounts and phone numbers used to reset forgotten passwords.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/04/election-2020-campaign-government-officials-targeted-iran-hackers/3865817002/", "description": "No email accounts associated with campaigns were compromised in attempt by Iranian-government link hacker.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
