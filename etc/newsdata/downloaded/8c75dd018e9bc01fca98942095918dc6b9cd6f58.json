They were written by the company in late August and released by the regulator on Tuesday.\n\nRepresentatives for the Kaspars could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nAfter its investigation Novartis fired Avexis\u2019 Chief Scientific Officer Brian Kaspar and Senior Vice President of Research and Development Allan Kaspar for cause on Aug. 13.\n\nThe company also said its internal investigation was drawn out because of the Kaspars' \"lack of cooperation and categorical denial of the allegations.\"\n\nZolgensma - the world's most expensive drug - was approved as a one-time treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in late May.\n\nThe disease often leads to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death within months for babies born with the most serious Type I form. SMA affects about one in 10,000 live births, with 50% to 70% having Type I disease, and is the leading genetic cause of death in infants.", "description": "Novartis blames former Avexis executives for Zolgensma manipulation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8N1FM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
