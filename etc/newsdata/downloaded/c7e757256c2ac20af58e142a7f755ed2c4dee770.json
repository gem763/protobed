I would rather be dead in a ditch.\u201d\n\nBut challenged on whether he would therefore resign if the bill becomes law, as it is expected to on Monday, he simply restated his objection to an extension.\n\n\u201cIt costs \u00a31 billion a month, it achieves nothing,\" he said. \"What on Earth is the point of further delay? I think it\u2019s totally, totally pointless.\u201d\n\nHe repeated his call for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to tell his MPs to vote for a snap election on 15 October, to allow time for the victor to go to Brussels for an EU summit two days later with a mandate from voters to negotiate either a deal or an extension to talks.\n\nThe prime minister's comments came in a sometimes shambolic speech at a police training academy, where he struggled to remember the formal words of an arrest caution and was forced to cut his remarks short when a female officer had to sit down after waiting in the warm sun for his delayed arrival.\n\nThere was anger at his use of a line-up of rows of uniformed cadets as a backdrop for highly partisan remarks, with Wakefield MP Mary Creagh saying she was \"very unhappy\" about cadets being used as \"wallpaper for Johnson\u2019s party political stunt\".\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Carries on spouting when a recruit feels faint and sits down,\" said Ms Creagh. \"We saw today how Johnson treats the police.\"\n\nHero policeman Charlie Guenigault, who was injured in the London Bridge terror attack, said that the event sent \"the wrong message\" by giving the impression that officers were displaying their political allegiance.\n\nJo Johnson\u2019s resignation comes just six weeks since he faced fierce criticism for returning to the government despite having resigned last year to campaign for a second EU referendum.\n\nIn a tweet announcing his decision to leave the government and stand down as MP for Orpington, he said it was impossible to reconcile \u201cfamily loyalty and the national interest\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s an unresolvable tension and time for others to take on my roles as MP and minister #overandout \u201c\n\nThe prime minister paid tribute to his brother as \u201ca fantastic guy and a brilliant minister\u201d who had supported his domestic agenda, but added: \u201cJo doesn\u2019t agree with me about the EU. It\u2019s an issue which obviously divides families and divides everybody.\n\n\"But what I think Jo would agree is that we need to get on and sort this thing out.\"\n\nIt is understood that Jo Johnson informed the prime minister of his plan to resign in a phone call on Wednesday evening.\n\nOne Westminster observer immediately summed up his decision to walk out as sending the message: \u201cI\u2019m resigning to spend less time with my family.\u201d\n\nOthers pointed back to an interview Boris Johnson gave, a few years ago, in which he insisted he and his brother would never suffer a family schism like David and Ed Miliband.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do things that way, that\u2019s a very left-wing thing,\u201d the elder Johnson said.\n\n\u201cOnly a socialist could do that to his brother, only a socialist could regard familial ties as being so trivial as to shaft his own brother.\u201d\n\nIt appeared the final straw for Jo Johnson was his brother\u2019s decision to \u201cpurge\u201d 21 moderate Conservatives from the party for their rebellion to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAmong the exiled MPs were colleagues, such as Justine Greening, with whom he had \u2013 before the summer \u2013 been working to try to avert a crash-out from the EU.\n\nOne of the 21, former defence minister Guto Bebb, told The Independent that the resignation was \"absolutely devastating to the credibility of Boris Johnson\".\n\n\"In effect, Jo is saying he has wrestled with the choice between loyalty to his brother or loyalty to the national interest and has concluded that loyalty to the national interest has to come first,\" said Mr Bebb.\n\n\"This is Jo Johnson - who is a decent, honourable person - saying quite categorically that his brother is not acting in the national interest.\"\n\nMr Bebb said he expected opposition parties to exploit the schism between the brothers in the same way that Conservatives did the rivalry between the Milibands, in a way which would be \"very damaging\" to the Tory cause in the expected election.\n\nBut another former minister told The Independent: \"It's not the same. Ed Miliband was challenging his brother. Jo is vacating the scene. His decision to leave parliament makes clear he is not doing this to damage his brother.\"\n\nAnd former justice secretary David Gauke, who had the whip removed after rebelling on Tuesday, said: \"Lots of MPs have had to wrestle with conflicting loyalties in recent weeks. None more so than Jo. This is a big loss to parliament, the government and the Conservative party.\"\n\nShadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \u201cBoris Johnson poses such a threat that even his own brother doesn\u2019t trust him.\u201d\n\nThe resignation capped a horror 24 hours for the new prime minister, who has yet to win a Commons vote \u2013 while suffering multiple defats at the hands of MPs.\n\nThe Commons refused to grant Mr Johnson a snap general election, less than two hours after passing a bill designed to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.\n\nAn election could yet be granted for his chosen date of 15 October if the bill becomes law by Tuesday, but Mr Corbyn is facing a growing Labour revolt to delay it further.\n\nWhen he first resigned, in November 2018, Jo Johnson branded Theresa May\u2019s negotiations as a \u201cfailure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis\u201d.\n\nWarning Britain stood \u201con the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War\u201d, the younger Johnson added: \u201cThe democratic thing to do is to give the public the Final Say.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson has said he would \"rather be dead in a ditch\" than ask the EU for an extension to Brexit negotiations, but declined to say whether he would resign rather than do so.
