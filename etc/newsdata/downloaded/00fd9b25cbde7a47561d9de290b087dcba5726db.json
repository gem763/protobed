The burger, called the P.L.T. or \"Plant. Lettuce. Tomato.,\" will appear on menus in Southern Ontario for 12 weeks, starting on September 30.\n\nRead more: McDonald's is teaming up with Beyond Meat to roll out a veggie burger at 28 locations\n\nMcDonald's did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the UBS report.\n\nUBS notes that the P.L.T. is designed to taste \"like a regular McDonald's burger.\" The firm says that McDonald's is testing the burger in Canada because it \"has a good representation of North American and European customers w/ flexitarian preferences, where MCD believes there is more demand for the offering than among vegans/vegetarians.\"\n\nMcDonald's will use the test to see whether customers actually order a veggie burger, as well as check whether adding a P.L.T. creates issues with operations and the supply chain, according to UBS. Even if the test is successful, McDonald's might test the product \u2014 or other plant-based products, such as chicken \u2014 in more markets before determining whether it wants to roll out a plant-based product in the US.\n\nIn a call with investors in April, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook said that the chain was internally discussing vegan and plant-based menu items.\n\nHowever, before adding a new plant-based menu item, Easterbrook said, McDonald's needs to establish: \"Is there an additional complexity? And if there is, is that complexity worth it?\"", "description": "As McDonald's tests a plant-based burger with Beyond Meat in Canada, analysts are on the look out for more veggie burgers.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e27ef2e22af72737d9f38?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
