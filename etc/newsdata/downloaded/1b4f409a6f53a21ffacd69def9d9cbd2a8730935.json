If your stance happens to be somewhere in the middle of the issue, here\u2019s another way of looking at things: It might be a great time to update your sheets, either to sleep in or get busy between. Whether you pop the \u201clittle pink pill\u201d or not in the coming season, here are four amazing start-up, online-only bedding labels to peruse.\n\nBoll & Branch\n\nFounded by a husband and wife team last year, Boll & Branch sells sheets made of cotton sourced directly from local farmers around the world. Their sustainable linens come in simple whites, ivories, blues, and grays, with banded, pleated, and vintage-inspired trim.\n\nParachute\n\nManufactured in Tuscany, Parachute is focused on careful design\u2014from its oversize cashmere throws that cover an entire bed, to its envelope closures on pillowcases. The company also partners with the United Nations Foundation\u2019s Nothing But Nets antimalaria campaign. The designs are minimal and modern, with materials that range from sateen to linen.\n\nCrane & Canopy\n\nThis bedding site works directly with manufacturers who are also in business with top luxury department stores, offering similar products at much lower costs. Crane & Canopy offers the widest range of styles and colors of the start-up bunch.\n\nBrooklinen\n\nBrooklinen's offerings are made with neutral color palettes, like navy, gray, and white, and its sheet patterns only go as far as a thin pinstripe or window pane. The allure of this brand is certainly its technique and use of long-staple Egyptian cotton, which produces sheets and comforters that are softer than most.", "description": "The FDA has just approved the first female libido pill\u2014maybe it\u2019s time to consider buying some new bedding.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Brooke Bob", "Janelle Okwodu", "Madeline Fass", "Kellee Terrell", "Emily Farra", "Emma Specter"], "top_image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5892037b186d7c1b6493d048/master/w_2560,c_limit/female-libido-sheets.jpg", "published_at": "2015-08-19"}
