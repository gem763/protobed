REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese IT services firm SB Technology Corp (4726.T) booked a 41% rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, marking the season\u2019s first earnings report of dozens of SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) units watched for hints about the parent\u2019s financial health.\n\nThe firm, 48% owned by SoftBank Corp (9434.T), reported operating profit for the three months through September of 794 million yen ($7.29 million) versus 563 million yen in the same period a year prior. It attributed the rise to a shift from providing IT consulting for local governments to cloud services.\n\nThe company maintained its full-year profit forecast at 3 billion yen.\n\nSB Technology's share price has risen almost 8% year-to-date. In Tuesday trade, it ended down 0.8% whereas the benchmark Nikkei index .N225 closed up 0.5%.\n\nSoftBank founder Masayoshi Son spends much of his time managing the group\u2019s $100 billion Vision Fund while other businesses, such as Japanese telecoms network operator SoftBank Corp, are run day to day by trusted managers.\n\nThe entrepreneur has struggled to garner funds for a second major technology fund following the aborted public offering of office-rental firm WeWork. SoftBank has pledged $38 billion to Vision Fund 2, but recent investment setbacks and a shortage of available cash have cast doubt on that commitment.\n\nWeWork\u2019s parent, The We Company, withdrew the planned listing after ousting its chief executive officer, Adam Neumann. That decision put pressure on WeWork to find alternative funding, with analysts predicting that the company will need several billion dollars over the next few years.\n\n($1 = 108.9700 yen)\n\n(Corrects typo in the headline)", "description": "Japanese IT services firm SB Technology Corp <4726.T> booked a 41% rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, marking the season's first earnings report of dozens of SoftBank Group Corp <9984.T> units watched for hints about the parent's financial health.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446096843&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0DZ", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
