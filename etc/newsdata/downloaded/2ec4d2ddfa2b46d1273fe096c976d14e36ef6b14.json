So do some Democrats.", "language": "en", "text": "On one side is GOP President Trump, who routinely describes the news media as the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and has attacked political adversaries such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), along with government whistleblowers at the center of the current impeachment inquiry, by saying that they might be guilty of \u201ctreason\u201d for challenging him.\n\nAD\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee, just tried to tag a current Democratic presidential candidate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), as a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d Last month, meanwhile, the left-leaning San Francisco city council unanimously passed a resolution calling the National Rifle Association a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization.\u201d Although nonbinding, the resolution sought to \u201climit those entities who do business with the City and County of San Francisco\u201d from doing business with the NRA.\n\nAD\n\nSan Francisco has also issued a blacklist of 22 states that its municipal employees are banned from traveling to as part of their jobs. Or, reports the Los Angeles Times, from entering into \u201cany new contracts with companies headquartered\u201d in any of those states if the laws of those states do not comport with California\u2019s approach to reproductive rights.\n\nWhat is most striking about these pronouncements is the acquiescence that accompanied them: A recent New York Times account of Clinton\u2019s comments seemed to praise her as a \u201cmaster troll\u201d and speculated on her possible return to politics, rather than addressing the gravity of her attack on Gabbard (who first drew Clinton\u2019s ire by endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries).\n\nAD\n\nLeading Democratic contenders such as former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) stayed mum when it came to supporting Gabbard or condemning Clinton. Even on the outrageous NRA \u201cterrorism\u201d measure or the blacklisting, leading Democrats have been largely silent. It is doubtful they would be so quiet after a similar attack by a right-leaning city against, say, Planned Parenthood.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has similarly accused a couple dozen people and organizations of \u201ctreason.\u201d And when he has, Democratic leaders have been quick \u2014 and justified \u2014 in denouncing such declarations as inimical to our protections of free speech and the free press. Yet, when a prominent Democrat suggests that another Democrat is a Russian asset or a staunchly Democratic city punishes whole states for adopting opposing policies, the reaction is muted, if discernible at all. The reason is obvious: It\u2019s unpopular to be seen as defending the right of others to hold opposing views, particularly if those others are members of groups like the NRA.\n\nIn the same way politicians once failed to speak out against Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) until his popularity waned \u2014 and his damage to U.S. democracy had already been done \u2014 many Democratic leaders have now gone silent. For years, even President Dwight D. Eisenhower avoided publicly confronting McCarthy\u2019s red-baiting. It fell to Sen. Margaret Chase Smith (R-Maine), then a freshman, to break the silence, when she took to the Senate floor, beseeching her colleagues to stop \u201cthinking politically as Republicans and Democrats about elections\u201d and start thinking about \u201cindividual freedom.\u201d That\u2019s the thing about crying Russians! If others hesitate or object, they join the list of fellow travelers.\n\nAD\n\nIt was only a matter of time before someone such as Clinton used this sort of cudgel against another Democrat. The \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d it seems, is now a vast Russian conspiracy that just happens to include her political foes.\n\nAD\n\nIn the case of San Francisco\u2019s blacklists, the approach is sadly ironic: Hollywood, one of California\u2019s cornerstone industries, has done countless movies about the Red Scare period and the targeting of artists for their political beliefs. In the infamous 1947 \u201cWaldorf Statement,\u201d major studios pledged not to do business with any of the listed individuals as they sought to \u201celiminate any subversives\u201d from the movie business. Now, almost three-quarters of a century after the creation of the Hollywood blacklist, a major California city is blacklisting whole states and the NRA for their stances on hot-button issues.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed and Supervisor Vallie Brown have been lauded in some circles for their move to bar business associations with nearly half the states in the nation due to their \u201csevere anti-choice policies.\u201d Brown tweeted: \u201cOur +$12 billion budget should be spent on what we stand for and reflect our values.\u201d Breed declared: \u201cWe have to fight back. Just as we restricted spending with states that have laws that discriminate against LGBTQ people, we are standing up against states that put women\u2019s health at risk and that are actively working to limit reproductive freedoms.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s a slippery slope: What happens when other groups say their values are just as important, and therefore call for the blacklisting of states, too?\n\nAD\n\nLGBT rights, environmental protection, immigration and other areas of the law are all ground for sharp differences between states. Colorado may not be on the blacklist for having \u201csevere anti-choice policies\u201d but it is a major coal producing and oil fracking area. It is not hard to envision an environmentalist group seeking to blacklist Colorado for its \u201csevere anti-environmental policies.\u201d\n\nStates could find themselves in the same unwinnable position of actors in the Hollywood blacklist era who lamented: \u201cEvery time I thought I was off the list, someone new named me.\u201d And the San Francisco blacklist could easily result in retaliatory listings from right-leaning states over its pro-choice or other \u201csevere\u201d policies.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not about the underlying issues \u2014 I\u2019m more inclined to agree with left-leaning jurisdictions on environmental protection. Rather, it\u2019s about some parts of the country punishing others for supporting opposing views, or coercing states to \u201creflect our values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA democratic nation allows, even encourages, disagreement when it comes to policy choices. Indeed, different state approaches are protected in our system of federalism. San Francisco looks to punish states because of their policies on abortion or gay rights. But most of the state laws in question are currently constitutional and, until the Supreme Court declares otherwise, these states are exercising their right to take a different path.\n\nFor example, it would have been equally wrong for Alabama to ban doing business with California when it recognized same-sex marriage. States differed on the interpretation of the constitutional protections for same-sex marriage. I shared the view of California that such marriages are protected. Yet, states had a right to reach their own conclusions on that constitutional question until the Supreme Court finally resolved the question in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nTo be sure, there is nothing illegal or unconstitutional about a state or city exercising its right to limit state contracts or purchases. But that doesn\u2019t make it right, or wise, to set off this type of interstate economic warfare. By cutting off fellow states, these blacklists risk creating a new patchwork system of state-by-state barriers reminiscent of the Articles of Confederation period. That period, before the adoption of our Constitution, left the country balkanized by predatory and punitive state measures directed against other states.\n\nAD\n\nUltimately, boycotts like San Francisco\u2019s are not designed to change minds. They are designed to thrill local voters while punishing those who fail to conform to a mandated view. Before a new war between the states escalates, people of good faith can act to support the right of self-determination in these states and to end a cycle of boycotts and counterboycotts. States should enact reciprocity laws that impose boycotts on any state that boycotts other states or cities for policy disagreements. States should consider measures banning their municipalities from taking this type of action.\n\nSan Francisco has already banned roughly half of the nation for not adhering to its views of acceptable state policies. The only deterrent is to boycott San Francisco, which relies heavily on business generated by hosting conferences. The key to such measures is that they must be content-neutral. If a city or state engages in economic boycotts against other states over policy differences, that act should trigger immediate isolation from other states \u2014 not the particular issues at stake. This type of boomerang boycott law would be based on the common democratic values in our system, recognizing the right or states to have differing policies.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the McCarthy period, Julia Child was pressured by the sister of conservative firebrand William F. Buckley Jr. (a McCarthy supporter) to boycott Smith College (Childs\u2019s alma mater) until five suspected communists were fired from the faculty.\n\nAD\n\nChilds responded with a profound letter that read: \u201cIn the blood-heat of pursuing the enemy, many people are forgetting what we are fighting for. We are fighting for our hard-won liberty and our freedom; for our Constitution and the due processes of our laws; and for the right to differ in ideas, religion and politics. I am convinced that in your zeal to fight against our enemies, you, too, have forgotten what you are fighting for.\u201d\n\nSo, it seems, have many on the left in the \u201cblood-heat\u201d of our contemporary politics.\n\nAD", "description": "Smearing candidates and ill-conceived boycotts show that the left is also capable of forgetting what it should stand for.", "authors": ["Jonathan Turley", "Jonathan Turley Is The Shapiro Professor Of Public Interest Law At George Washington University."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bcXYlyBvBmDf0qFSOzxGshcW6cc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VHGJIHHPVUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
