She then went on to explain that learning your husband is a dirty, filthy cheat but working through it (which may well be commendable, incidentally, if motivated by love) is rather like the challenges that come with learning that your child is transgender (a word, I imagine, she had one of her aides explain in the car ride to the studio).\n\nIt\u2019s amazing, really. Hilary Clinton must be one of the most transparently disingenuous politicians to have ever lived. So much so that my own womanly \u201cgutsy\u201d is feeling rather queasy.", "description": "Hilary Clinton must be one of the most transparently disingenuous politicians to have ever lived.", "authors": ["Madeleine Kearns", "Andrew C.
