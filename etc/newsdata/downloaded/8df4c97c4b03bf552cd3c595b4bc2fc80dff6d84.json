Interest is so high that places on the tours could be rationed to control the numbers. \u201cWe might have to limit it to a few places per organisation,\u201d he said.\n\nTurnbull is keen to proselytise the success of the scheme to other councils but he is anxious to do so without compromising the privacy and good will of residents. \u201cWe are tying to share our knowledge and experience as much as we can and get the message out there that councils can do this, because we\u2019d like to see it replicated across the UK if not wider.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of the residents of the Goldsmith Street estate, Joe Harrington said: \u2018I find some of the interest a bit gross.\u2019 Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nFilmmaker Joe Harrington welcomes the interest in his new home, but urged visitors to respect the dignity and privacy of residents. He said: \u201cYes we live in really nice places, but that doesn\u2019t mean we are here to be gawped at.\u201d\n\nHarrington, who lives in a two-bed home with his partner and two young children, added: \u201cI strongly believe this place should be admired and people should come and revel in the achievement and see that council housing can be good and affordable.\u201d\n\nBut he said that some of the interest from visitors and media had been patronising.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like, \u2018I bet you\u2019re so grateful\u2019. I appreciate that it\u2019s rare and we\u2019re lucky, but they are not in a position to tell us we\u2019re lucky. I find some of the interest a bit gross.\n\n\u201cI appreciate that this is not my property and the council have a right to bring visitors. And so long as it is not a freak show to look at how the poor live, it\u2019s fine. But visitors need to remember these are people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nTurnbull said the council could not stop people coming to visit what are public streets.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are lot of people just wandering around taking photos. None of the residents have complained so far, but we recognise it could become an issue for them in the long term. We have a lot of good will at the moment from residents and we don\u2019t want to lose that.\u201d\n\nGail Harris, the council\u2019s deputy leader and cabinet member for housing, said: \u201cWe are aware of the impact that this attention could have on our residents and we trying to manage visits when we know about them.\u201d\n\nMichael Jones, the head of housing at York city council, visited Goldsmith Street in July and plans to build three similar estates in York with the same architects and to the same Passivhaus energy-efficient standards.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe site visit gave us the confidence to do it. I remember getting goosebumps walking around.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEveryone who is interested in housing should go.\u201d And he insisted this could be done without encroaching on residents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they are rightly proud but they don\u2019t want lots of strangers poking around. There are ways of visiting \u2013 you don\u2019t need to go and peer through people\u2019s windows. You can walk down the street and still experience it. It is really inspiring in every respect.\u201d", "description": "Council plans regular visits to Goldsmith Street, which won architectures\u2019 Stirling prize", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5bff3cf676a352fea87d6394eeb9fb20a42b622/0_251_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c16b9e1b7c3b9ec4c1ddbfcc0df5f9c8", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
