But before doing so, the duchess apparently spent some time at Thomas's Battersea attending a meeting all about mental health.\n\n\n\nAccording to People, Kate was present for the three-hour workshop, which was run by Hope Virgo, an author and mental health campaigner. The session apparently \"covered everything from body image issues to how pupils can emotionally support each other\".\n\nSpeaker Virgo told People that she even spoke to the duchess in person after the session. She revealed: \"Kate came up and personally spoke to me afterwards, which was nice. We spoke about the work that I do in schools, particularly for younger people, and we spoke about the importance of early intervention and prevention. She was very chatty and friendly.\"\n\nThe author also told People that the session was for children at the school between the ages of 11 and 13-years-old, and that it was \"about being kind to themselves and not constantly comparing themselves to everyone around them\".\n\nKate recently joined husband Prince William in dropping Princess Charlotte at school, alongside Prince George who has already attended Thomas's Battersea for a number of years.\n\nPhoto credit: WPA Pool - Getty Images More\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"Kate came up and personally spoke to me afterwards, which was nice\"", "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4qgUES9HNvoo2FVpsFFgzA--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/225a6a024ca2cc05929a56a6e7f6507b", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
