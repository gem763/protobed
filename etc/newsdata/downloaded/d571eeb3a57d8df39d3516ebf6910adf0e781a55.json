That is until the Impossible Whopper hit the market last month, with the idea catching like wildfire ever since.\n\n\"We know that about three-fourths of Americans are open to plant-based eating, yet only 1 in 4 actually purchase a plant-based alternative,\" Young said. \"So, the intent is fully there, but it hasn't necessarily been followed with action. We know the number one barrier to trying plant-based protein is taste. These consumers are still seeking the amazing taste, texture, and sizzling qualities of meat but want a better alternative for themselves and the planet.\"\n\nWhile MorningStar Farms has been in the business for some 45 years, Burger King has led the recent market expansion of plant-based burgers, and the payoff has been hard to ignore for competitors, with the Impossible Whopper predicted to contribute 6 percent to same-store sales growth at U.S. Burger Kings this quarter alone, according to the market research and investment firm Cowen.\n\nAccording to a recent Fox Business Network appearance by FAIRR Initiative Director Maria Lettini, corporate and consumer interest in the plant-based food market is expected to turn what is currently a $20 billion a year industry into a $100 billion industry over the next ten years.\n\nAccording to a press release announcing the new product line on Wednesday, MorningStar Farms already delivers roughly 90 million pounds of plant-based protein to consumers nationwide, with that number expected to grow once the new Incogmeato product line hits stores next year.\n\nNielsen data shows that when consumers first try MorningStar Farms plant-based products, they're more likely to come back for more due in part to improved tastes and textures, variety of meatless food options, and affordable prices, according to the company\u2019s press release.\n\nKellogg's MorningStar Farms corners a unique part of the plant-based burger market, as they offer a retail alternative to fast food companies like Burger King and KFC, who just introduced it's plant-based fried chicken alternative on Aug. 27.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMorningStar Farms\u2019 new Incogmeato products are set to hit retail freezers in early 2020, with the 4-ounce plant-based patties being sold in store\u2019s refrigerated meat cases and the plant-based Chik\u2019n nuggets and tenders being sold in the freezer aisle alongside tradition, meat-based chicken products.", "description": "Kellogg's-owned MorningStar Farms, the maker's of America's No. 1 veggie burger, are expanding their plant-based food portfolio as the market for meatless, plant-based burgers grows by the week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Kelloggs-MorningStar-Farms-Incogmeato-patties-and-chicken-tenders.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
