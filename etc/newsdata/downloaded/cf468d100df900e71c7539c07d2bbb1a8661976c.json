big and small - face tough new reforms from the regulator in an effort to drive up customer service standards and reduce the risk of failure.\n\nThe proposals will ensure fast growing energy firms can demonstrate they are able to take on additional customers effectively and meet industry obligations while also remaining financially viable, Ofgem says.\n\nIt comes on the back of a series of energy suppliers going bust in the past couple of years.\n\nThis is thanks to increased competition in the market which has led to some smaller companies unable to keep up the pace of more competitive firms.\n\nOfgem is cracking down on energy firms to ensure they provide better customer service\n\nAlthough this competition has led to generally cheaper deals for customers, there has been reports of complaints about the level of customer service some customers have received from certain suppliers.\n\nCustomers have also suffered from a lack of organisation and resources when a supplier has gone bust.\n\nMary Starks, executive director of consumers and markets at Ofgem, said: 'Our regulatory regime needs to be effective and proportionate in protecting consumers, while continuing to facilitate competition and innovation.\n\n'At this stage in the transition to a net zero emissions economy it is more important than ever that innovators can enter the market and prosper, driving benefits for consumers.\n\n'The new proposals will create more accountability in the market, require more responsible and appropriate behaviour from suppliers in the market and reduce the risk and costs to consumers associated with supplier failure.'\n\nOne of the new rules proposed for existing suppliers will allow Ofgem to request independent audits of suppliers' customer service operations and financial status.\n\nNew checks will also be introduced for growing suppliers prior to them hitting certain thresholds of customer numbers with the checks requiring them to make sure they have the operational capability to serve their customers.\n\nOfgem has said suppliers will be subject to new checks to ensure they can serve efficiently\n\nIf they then failed these checks, they would be stopped from taking any more customers on.\n\nOfgem said it 'wants to ensure customers are protected' from bad customer service and ensure any impact on the wider market is minimised.\n\nThe watchdog is also proposing further 'fit and proper' requirements which would ensure those in senior management roles are fit to carry out their duties and introduce a new principle which says suppliers have to be open and cooperative with the regulator.\n\nAnother reform is that suppliers will have to set out what would happen in the event of their failure including detailing any hurdles to an 'orderly exit'.\n\nOfgem has also said rules would be introduced to ensure that, when a supplier fails, certain consumer protections around debt collection practices remain in place.\n\nThey will be required to put in place arrangements to ensure that they would be able to cover a proportion of customers' credit balances and government environmental scheme costs if they failed.\n\nThis would not affect the protections already in place to cover all domestic credit balances when a supplier fails.\n\nGillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Today's announcement looks like good news for energy customers.\n\n'Ofgem's proposals should limit the costs to consumers of failed suppliers, as well as delivering better consumer protections.\n\n'We have seen a number of cases where customers in debt to failed suppliers were subjected to aggressive debt collection by administrators who were not bound by Ofgem rules.\n\n'Stopping this from happening will reduce the unnecessary stress and pressure placed on affected customers.\n\n'New requirements to protect customers' credit balances should go some way to limiting the costs left behind when firms collapse.'\n\nResearch from the charity estimates that recent supplier failures led to an additional \u00a3172million being added to bills.\n\nGillian adds: 'Most of these costs arose from companies leaving behind unpaid industry bills for renewable schemes.\n\n'The Government should legislate to require suppliers make these payments more regularly, and further limit the costs to consumers when these companies fail.'\n\nSo far, Eversmart, Solarplicity, Brilliant Energy, Extra Energy, Spark Energy, Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, Usio Energy, One Select, Our Power and Economy Energy have all gone bust in recent times.", "description": "The new rules will ensure fast growing energy firms can demonstrate they are able to take on additional customers effectively and meet industry obligations whilst also remaining financially viable.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
