Dubbed Uber Pet, the new feature will be available in select cities starting on October 16th.\n\nIt used to be that bringing a dog or cat in an Uber was unpredictable. Uber recommended customers contact their drivers before bringing pets in the car, but it\u2019s likely that many people didn\u2019t follow this advice. Surprise pets are among the many complaints that you\u2019ll hear from Uber drivers.\n\nDrivers have allergies or don\u2019t want to deal with shedding or clean-up. As a result, oftentimes, the ride would be canceled. Uber wants to reduce that friction with this new feature.\n\nNow, riders can select Uber Pet among the list of options before selecting a ride. A surcharge of $3 to $5 will be included in the upfront pricing when the option is selected in the app.\n\nMeanwhile, drivers who don\u2019t feel like shepherding creatures of the four-legged variety can opt out in the preferences section of the driver app. If, however, they choose to welcome those pets as passengers, they will be guaranteed to receive a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of the surcharge on top of their standard trip earnings.\n\nService animals, however, are exempt. Uber\u2019s policies \u2014 which is in accordance with state and federal law \u2014 are that service animals are allowed to ride at all times at no extra cost.\n\nUber Pet will be available to all customers starting on October 16th in the following cities: Austin, Denver, Nashville, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Tampa Bay.", "description": "Uber is experimenting with a new feature that aims to reduce cancellations as a result of customers bringing a pet along for the ride.
