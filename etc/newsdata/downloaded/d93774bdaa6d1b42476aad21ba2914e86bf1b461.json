The glamorous Hotel de la Coupole was designed by Bill Bensley -- the mastermind behind some of Asia's most stunning hotels, like Rosewood Luang Prabang and Cambodia's Shinta Mani Wild -- and resembles a luxurious European palace from the early 20th century.\n\nRelated content The paradise maker: Meet luxury resort designer Bill Bensley\n\nA throwback to the early 1900s\n\n\"The DNA of the hotel is the nostalgia of the French Indochine era of the early 1900s,\" says Jean-Pierre Joncas, Hotel de la Coupole's general manager. \"French haute couture blended with vibrant hill tribe ethnic colors.\"\n\nThe interior of the 249-key hotel reflects this DNA.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade and \"classic\" rooms adopt shades of mustard -- a typical color used in the French Indochine era, while other rooms feature bright orange and ruby red colors, inspired by Sapa's Hmong hill tribe.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nEmbroideries and patterns on some of the fabrics also pay tribute to Hmong culture. The chandelier in the lobby is inspired by a traditional Hmong hat.\n\nAntique objects -- including original storefronts from 1900s Paris -- are part of the hotel's elaborate interior.\n\n\"With the development of tourism, as an operator, we really want to educate our guests so that they respect the area and they respect the local cultures that they may be meeting for the first time,\" says Joncas.\n\n\"And on the other side, we do want to work with the locals and the local community... about how to preserve that culture and preserve their uniqueness.\"\n\nSome of the biggest highlights include an indoor spa and swimming pool, La Grand Bassin, that looks like a scene from a Wes Anderson movie, a 435-square-meter ballroom and a kids' club for the young ones.\n\nRelated content 30 of Vietnam's most beautiful places\n\nIn terms of dining, the hotel is home to a French restaurant with a local twist, a rooftop bar overlooking the mountains of Sapa and a French patisserie.\n\nHotel de la Coupole is a part of Accor Hotel Group's boutique MGallery Hotel series, which focuses on history, literature and culture.", "description": "Sapa is one of Vietnam's hottest tourist destinations thanks to stunning rice terraces and tribal culture.
