China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will be the focus of attention at next week\u2019s United Nations summit on climate action in New York, with Beijing promising more ambition when it comes to tackling global warming.\n\nChina has been under pressure to curb investments in coal, at home and overseas, but Chinese financial institutions have continued to support coal projects.\n\nBeijing said on Tuesday, in a position paper ahead of the U.N. meeting, that it would remain on \u201cthe clean energy and low-carbon development path\u201d but stopped short of setting new targets.\n\nChina has cut the share of coal in its total energy mix from more than 68% in 2012 to 59% by the end of last year, but overall consumption has continued to increase.\n\nChina had 1,160 GW of coal-fired power by the end of July, amounting to 62.8% of the its total installed capacity. A Chinese industry group has suggested total capacity could eventually settle at 1,300 GW.", "description": "China's total planned coal-fired power projects now stand at 226.2 gigawatts (GW), the highest in the world and more than twice the amount of new capacity on the books in India, according to data published by environmental groups on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
