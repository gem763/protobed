Police have illegally and unconstitutionally opened fire on the protesters,\u201d 22-year-old madrasa student Mahmudul Hasan told AFP at a rally in the capital Dhaka.\n\n\u201cIt is an extrajudicial killing. We seek justice.\u201d\n\nThe Hindu man whose Facebook account hosted the original messages and is from Bhola, was charged with inciting religious tension.\n\nBut Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called for calm Sunday and said the man\u2019s Facebook account was hacked by a Muslim person and used to \u201cspread lies\u201d.\n\nThousands of protesters who took part in the Bhola protest were being investigated, local police chief Enamul Haque told AFP, adding a police officer was also \u201cfighting for his life\u201d after he was shot by demonstrators.\n\nNo arrests have yet been made, he added.\n\nThis is not the first time alleged Facebook posts have sparked large-scale religious violence in the impoverished South Asian country.\n\nIn 2016, angry Muslims attacked Hindu temples in an eastern town over a Facebook post that allegedly mocked one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites.\n\nAnd in 2012, Muslim mobs torched Buddhist monasteries, houses and shops in the coastal Cox\u2019s Bazar district after a photo of the koran that was considered defamatory was put online by a young Buddhist.", "description": "Dhaka (AFP) \u2013 Thousands protested against police across Bangladesh on Monday, a day after at least four people died when officers fired on a crowd", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/19212f_protesters-streets-dhaka-angry-police-who-fired-on-crowd-on-sunday-leaving-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
