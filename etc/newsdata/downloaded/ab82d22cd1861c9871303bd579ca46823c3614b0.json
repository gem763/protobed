She became Peaches \u2014 a foul-mouthed electro-punk rapper in pink leather hot pants.\n\nWarning: This video contains strong language.\n\nIt was an act that was a bit too hot for Toronto at the time, so Peaches moved to Berlin where her sexually explicit songs found a much warmer reception. The moment she dropped her debut album, The Teaches of Peaches, in 2000, she became an instant icon with a list of celebrity fans that included the likes of Madonna, Pink, Yoko Ono and Iggy Pop.\n\nWhile Peaches' music and stage shows have become even more outrageous and explicit over the years, at the heart of her work remains a serious critique of the patriarchy, gender norms and the objectification of women. Those themes are on display \u2014 literally \u2014 in Peaches' new solo art exhibition running now in Hamburg, Germany until Oct. 20.\n\nAccompanying the art show is a touring live show, There's Only One Peach With The Hole In The Middle, featuring almost 40 musicians and performers presenting the past, present and future of queer feminism. It will be staged Dec. 28, 29 and 30 in Berlin.\n\nPeaches joined q's Tom Power from a studio in Berlin to tell us more about the exhibition and to reflect on her musical legacy.\n\nCheck out Peaches discussing her art show on her Instagram below.\n\nDownload our podcast or click the 'Listen' link near the top of this page to hear the full conversation with Peaches.\n\n\u2014 Produced by \u200bStuart Berman and Catherine Stockhausen", "description": "Peaches' first-ever solo art exhibition is running at the Kunstverein, one of the oldest art associations in Hamburg, Germany.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306115.1570043219!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/peaches.jpg"}
