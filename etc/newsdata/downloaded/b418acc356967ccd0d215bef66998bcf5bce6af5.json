He said the same grade was given to the Conservatives and the NDP.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May says other parties have been misleading voters but singles out the NDP for targeting her and her party. 1:34\n\nCBC News has analyzed almost 3,200 press releases and tweets from official party and party leader accounts since the start of the campaign.\n\nAccording to that review, about 40 per cent of the NDP's messages are negative.\n\nCBC's review also found that, while the Conservatives lead other major federal parties in the amount of negative attacks, the Liberals have grown increasingly negative as the campaign wears on.\n\nAlmost half (48 per cent) of Conservative communications have been negative or partly negative. The share of negative messages is 31 per cent for the Liberals, 18 per cent for the Greens and 14 per cent for the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which has run the most positive campaign.", "description": "Green Leader Elizabeth May said in a release Sunday that if her party is elected Monday, it will make sure this is the last federal government in Canada chosen by the first-past-the-post system.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323489.1571354876!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-greens-20191016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
