Murray sued the company in 2013 eventually being awarded $1.75 million in damages, according to a release by Murray\u2019s lawyers following the verdict in 2015.\n\nA judge would later reduce the settlement to $680,000.\n\n\u201cThis jury resoundingly told Johnson & Johnson that its actions were deliberate and malicious,\u201d Murray\u2019s lawyers, Thomas R. Kline and Jason Itkin, said in a statement. \u201cThe conduct that the jury saw in the courtroom was clear and convincing that J&J disregarded the safety of the most vulnerable of children. This is an important moment, not only for this litigation but for J&J, which is a company that has lost its way.\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson called the jury\u2019s decision \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d with the initial award given in the case.\n\n\u201cThis award for a single plaintiff stands in stark contrast with the initial $680,000 compensatory award and is a clear violation of due process,\u201d the company said in a statement, stating that it was prevented from \u201cpresenting a meaningful defense due to the court\u2019s exclusion of key evidence\u201d and that the plaintiff failed to prove the harm he was caused by their client\u2019s product.\n\n\u201cWe will be immediately moving to set aside this excessive and unfounded verdict,\u201d it said.\n\nThe decision is significant in that thousands of more cases against the pharmaceutical giant concerning Risperdal are waiting to be tried.\n\nThe jury\u2019s decision Tuesday is the latest legal setback for the company that was ordered by an Oklahoma judge in August to pay $573 million for its role in the opioid crisis.\n\nEarlier this month, the company reached a $20.4 million settlement with two Ohio counties over similar accusations.", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 A Philadelphia jury has ordered healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson to pay $8 billion in damages to a Maryland man who developed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
