(AP) - More than 488,000 people visited Glacier National Park in Montana in September, a 12.5% increase over the same month last year.\n\nThe Flathead Beacon reports that the National Park Service says so far this year 2.9 million people have come to the park, a 3.5% jump over 2018.\n\nThe strong September numbers come on the heels of a busy August, when more than 771,000 people visited Glacier.\n\nJust two months ago, year-to-date visitation was down more than 3%, with 1.6 million people coming to the park between January and July.\n\nOne likely reason for the spike in August and September visitation is that for the first time in three years, the park did not have a major wildfire.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Flathead Beacon, http://www.flatheadbeacon.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "More than 488,000 people visited Glacier National Park in Montana in September, a 12.5% increase over the same month last year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
