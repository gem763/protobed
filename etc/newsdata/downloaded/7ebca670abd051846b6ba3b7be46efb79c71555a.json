It\u2019s an uncomfortable truism.\n\nThe discussion around privilege is nuanced; it requires an understanding of dynamics within various communities and how those various communities interact with each other. Sometimes, when we\u2019re engaged in our almost ritualistic cycle of celeb backlash, commentary and fallout, it\u2019s easy to forget how the dynamics of marginalized groups can shift. Black hetero men, so often centered in our discussions surrounding racism, family, and community, can contribute to the marginalization of women and LGBTQ people in the community. One can become oblivious to that\u2014even in trying to fight \u201cthe good fight\u201d against bigotry. Recent headlines have made that clearer.\n\nBeing a black man in America means navigating the racism of the majority, but it also has to mean understanding how our position within our culture affords us power to stand over others in that culture. Two of entertainment\u2019s most successful and controversial comedians have faced recent criticism for their inability or unwillingness to recognize the latter.\n\nDave Chappelle and Kevin Hart have both been at the center of PR nightmares as the result of remarks they\u2019ve made about the LGBTQ community and LGBTQ issues. Those controversies were back under the spotlight recently. In August, Chappelle\u2019s latest Netflix special, Sticks & Stones, reignited what feels like an ongoing back-and-forth between the comic and the audience he seems to revel in provoking. And Hart, during this week\u2019s appearance on LeBron James\u2019 HBO series The Shop, sparked an uncomfortable exchange when rapper Lil Nas X explained why he\u2019d decided to come out just as he was breaking big with the No. 1 hit \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he was gay! So what?\u201d Hart interrupted as marketing executive Paul Rivera asked Lil Nas X about the decision.\n\nThe 19-year old shared why he thought it was important.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I was being forced. It\u2019s just like knowing growing up, I\u2019m growing up to hate this shit. I\u2019m not supposed\u2014\u201d\n\nHart abruptly interrupts him again.\n\n\u201cHate what? Why? Why are you growing up to hate?\u201d the comedy star asks.\n\n\u201cHomosexuality, gay people,\u201d Lil Nas X responded. \u201cCome on now, if you\u2019re really from the hood, you know.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to say: \u201cIf for me, the \u2018cool dude with the song on top of everything,\u2019 to say this at any other time, I\u2019m doing this for attention in my eyes. But if you\u2019re doing this while you\u2019re at the top, you know it\u2019s for real,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s showing it doesn\u2019t really matter, I guess.\u201d\n\nAs Hart recuperates from a serious car accident, his The Shop reaction was roundly criticized as tone-deaf. It highlighted what so many have tried to address as it pertains to homophobia: willful ignorance regarding a black man\u2019s ability to punch down.\n\nIn Hart\u2019s case, the \u201cwhy is it a big deal?\u201d reaction suggests that one doesn\u2019t understand why a high-profile young black man coming out is still important. Black men are under a racist scope in this country, and have been since before this country was a country; the reality of what it means to be black in America plays out in our lives daily.\n\nBut we must recognize how we can culturally, politically and fundamentally leverage our position within our own community against the most vulnerable in our community. A gay black man making it clear that he is gay is a revolutionary act when so much of what he sees every day tells him his existence is wrong.\n\nWearing a burqa in a conservative Christian town, growing your hair into an Afro when you\u2019re the only black woman in the office\u2014these are only seen as acts of defiance or antagonism because they fly in the face of so-called societal standards; similarly, a man telling his peers that he prefers men is only ostentatious because it subverts the inherent homophobia in our wider culture. That\u2019s why what Lil Nas X did made sense and remains necessary. But it\u2019s also why Hart needed to pretend he didn\u2019t understand why it matters.\n\nThe \u201cwho cares?\u201d refrain is always disingenuous. Hart\u2019s Oscar controversy from earlier this year, when the star decided to back out as host of the awards show after old homophobic tweets resurfaced, led to a reluctant, unofficial post-Oscar apology-refusal tour.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t be conveniently framed as a black man\u2019s forced humiliation at not bowing to some gay white Hollywood power, but more as Hart\u2019s defensive reaction to being made to face how his words helped marginalize those in his community who experience hate within that community constantly. Homophobia, obviously, isn\u2019t exclusive to the black community, but homophobia anywhere is detrimental.\n\nChappelle\u2019s latest Netflix special has sparked the expected controversy; his set takes aim at everything from Anthony Bourdain\u2019s suicide to the Jussie Smollett case\u2014but some of the reactions ignore how most of this is standard-issue Chappelle.\n\nIn the early 2000s, he joked about Elizabeth Smart\u2019s kidnapping, O.J., R. Kelly and Michael Jackson both in his stand-up and on his much-beloved sketch show. The acidity in his humor has always been a part of why it resonated. What\u2019s frustrating now is seeing how, in his mid-40s, he\u2019s decided to cling so tightly to ideas a man of his intelligence and insight should be evolving past.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that I can say the word \u2018n*gger\u2019 with impunity, but can\u2019t say the word \u2018f*ggot?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c In his hetero-privileged hand, the word can only wield oppressive power, not subversive redirection. \u201d\n\nWhen Chappelle relays the story\u2014that he was asked not to say \u201cf*ggot\u201d by Standards and Practices at Comedy Central during his Chappelle\u2019s Show run because he\u2019s not gay\u2014and ends the bit with \u201cI\u2019m not a n*gger, either,\u201d he\u2019s pointedly obscuring the harder, messier truth: that, just as Comedy Central is in no position to tell him he can\u2019t subversively use the N-word, he\u2019s in no position to decide who is or is not a \u201cf*ggot.\u201d Because in his hetero-privileged hand, the word can only wield oppressive power, not subversive redirection.\n\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d Most people do. And you have to see that in order to grasp why the black LGBTQ community has to be a part of how we see ourselves as black people.\n\n\u201cWhat I wanna say to Lil Nas X is that in no way shape or form should you have to defend [yourself],\u201d Hart shared on The Shop. \u201cWhen you have a voice and simply say \u2018this\u2019 [being gay], there is no back-and-forth about what \u2018this\u2019 is. Nothing else needs to be said.\u201d\n\nHart\u2019s words of so-called LGBTQ solidarity came after his refusal to host the Oscars and a subsequent backlash; while Chappelle seems to relish poking this particular audience at this point. When Richard Pryor famously announced he would no longer use \u201cn*gger\u201d in his set during his 1983 concert film Here and Now, it wasn\u2019t because of pressure or criticism\u2014not that he hadn\u2019t endured both. It was because of his personal conviction (and maybe had a stake in earning some goodwill following some personal setbacks), not because he\u2019d been publicly repudiated. Until and unless Chappelle, in particular, has a Pryor-esque epiphany, this is who he is.\n\nThere\u2019s always a need for comedy that makes people uncomfortable, but when it comes from a societal perch, it\u2019s more handily a tool to preserve the comforts of the status quo. Regarding Hart and Chappelle, criticism is warranted, but white liberals also have to accept that Black voices aren\u2019t beholden to their takes, and those Black voices are varied. There can be an eagerness to address these celebs without acknowledging that white privilege is still white privilege and can be brandished as such even from marginalized white folks. This particular discussion is being had with or without your positing what it all means. Our comics have always been ours, first and foremost, and their stories have always mattered. These guys will keep telling Black stories. Who will still be listening remains to be seen.", "description": "The two superstar comedians have come under fire for their insensitivity to the LGBTQ community.
