It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts\u2026 each act was mutual and completely consensual.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an upcoming book that was excerpted by Variety on Wednesday, Nevils alleges that Lauer raped her anally after she \u201cdeclined several times\u201d one night in his hotel room during the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia. She claims she consumed six shots of vodka before the encounter, which she said rendered her incapable of consent, and wept into a pillow during the assault.\n\nAfterwards, she alleges she was bleeding for days. Nevils said that the two had multiple sexual encounters following that night but that they were \u201ccompletely transactional\u201d due to the power dynamic inherent in their professional relationship.\n\nThe allegation appears in the soon-to-be-released book \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d by journalist Ronan Farrow, whose reporting was one of the major catalysts of the Me Too movement.\n\nLauer took a thinly-veiled shot at Farrow himself, saying the allegations are \u201cpart of a promotional effort to sell a book.\u201d\n\nThe former anchor was fired from the \u201cToday Show\u201d two years ago after several women went public with accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cFor two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations,\u201d Lauer wrote. \u201cAnd I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d", "description": "Matt Lauer on Wednesday vehemently denied a new rape accusation against him, calling the claim by his former NBC colleague 'false and salacious.'", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
