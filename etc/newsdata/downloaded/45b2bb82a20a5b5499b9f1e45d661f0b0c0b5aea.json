The paper is published by The Washington Post and when Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos bought The Post in 2013, Express ran the headline: \u201cBezos Buys Express! (oh \u2026 and the Washington Post too).\u201d\n\nSo when it came time to close down Express, the publication went out with an all-time great. Thursday\u2019s farewell edition depicted a trademark yellow Express box on its side and underneath the stark headline, \u201cHope You Enjoy Your Stinkin\u2019 Phones.\u201d\n\nAfter 16 years, The Post shut down Express, one day after informing staff of the decision.\n\nDan Caccavaro, the only editor in chief the paper has ever known, said when contacted by The Associated Press that he had been at a staff gathering the previous night that was \u201cmore like an Irish wake, a lot of laughing and crying and drinking.\u201d\n\nCaccavaro blamed changing consumer habits and said it had become increasingly rare to see subway riders reading Express or anything else printed on actual paper. The publication had once been a steady profit generator, but it barely broke even last year and ad revenue was trending downward. Circulation had dropped from a peak of 190,000 copies to about 130,000.\n\n\u201cYou kind of knew your time was limited,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I had no warning that this was coming now.\u201d\n\nThe closure drew a fierce reaction from The Post\u2019s union, which has engaged in tense negotiations with Bezos. The Washington Post Guild said in a statement that the 20 Express employees were fired Wednesday without warning. The employees had no Guild protections because they had not been allowed to join the union for reasons that the statement called \u201cbureaucratic fictions.\u201d\n\nThe statement urged management to find positions for the laid-off employees. Caccavaro, who also was let go, said he believes \u201cthere\u2019s a genuine effort\u201d underway to find new homes for his former staffers.\n\nThe Post, in a statement, called Express \u201can integral part of the morning commute for Washingtonians.\u201d It noted that the introduction of WiFi in Washington\u2019s Metro system had enabled riders to stay online during their commute and reduced the need for publications such as Express.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After 16 years, The Washington Post shut down Express, one day after informing staff of the decision.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ashraf Khalil"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/express_newspaper_83854_c0-410-4896-3264_s1770x1032.jpg?a1ae42f06fa93a78c97126641cdefe9e517cf265"}
