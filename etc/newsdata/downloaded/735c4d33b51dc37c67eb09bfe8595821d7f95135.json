I was told yesterday by my agent that the GM then went behind my back and shopped me around to teams, even after I asked him to keep me here! Crazy business. \u2014 Jamal Adams (@TheAdamsEra) October 29, 2019\n\nDouglas: Jets weren\u2019t shopping players\n\nDouglas told reporters after the trade deadline that he took calls on players, but ultimately didn\u2019t pull the trigger when the offers didn\u2019t match the value he placed on them.\n\nStory continues\n\nJets GM Douglas says there was 'no fire sale' as New York keeps Adams, Bell and Anderson at trade deadline.\n\n\n\nStory by @dwaz73 >> https://t.co/XNI81QiJWc pic.twitter.com/9c08GWd2xu \u2014 AP NFL (@AP_NFL) October 30, 2019\n\nHe also insisted that there wasn\u2019t a planned \u201cfire sale\u201d of Jets players and that the Jets weren\u2019t \u201cshopping\u201d on the trade market, with running back Le\u2019Veon Bell and wide receiver Robby Anderson also rumored to be on the block.\n\n\u201cI mean, I just want to reiterate, we were not shopping any of those players that were talked about today,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cYou guys see Jamal every day. He wears the \u2018C\u2019 patch for a reason. The guy\u2019s an absolute warrior. He\u2019s the heartbeat of this team and this defense. He\u2019s got the exact mentality, and I told him from the beginning, from my first day here, he\u2019s a mission statement guy.\n\nHe chalked Adams\u2019 angst up to a matter of miscommunication in an interview later with 98.7 ESPN.\n\n\u201cIn this case, it\u2019s a simple miscommunication,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cSomeone told him I was shopping him around. That\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nAdams appears unhappy in New York\n\nAdams, who was drafted under previous management in 2017, has sent multiple signals this season that he\u2019s not happy with the Jets, who sit at 1-6 after Sunday\u2019s loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nHe complained publicly after a Week 2 loss to the Cleveland Browns about being benched.\n\n\u201cI tried to anticipate a play, and I anticipated wrong,\u201d Adams wold WFAN in September. \u201cThey benched me.\u201d\n\nJamal Adams says he didn't demand a trade and that Jets management \"went behind my back\" in trade talks. (Steven Ryan/Getty)\n\nAdams then wiped any mention of the Jets from his Twitter profile. Where it once read \u201cdefensive back for the New York Jets,\u201d it was replaced with a religious quote. There is no mention of the Jets in his Twitter profile as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAdams canceled a weekly appearance on WFAN after being asked about the social media changes.\n\nAdams remains on his rookie contract with the Jets through 2020, and the team has an option for 2021, meaning Adams wouldn\u2019t be eligible for unrestricted free agency until 2022.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jamal Adams says he didn't demand a trade and that Jets management \"went behind my back\" in trade talks.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZJzTJ4q9GQ6dy9DTDj1Daw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pUtvvoYS5FvgfBKuWV9oOA--~B/aD0zNTU2O3c9NTMzNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/65c5e120-fa9c-11e9-bafa-600afd2032d2", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
