(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that it will not cooperate with House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, ratcheting up tensions between the legislative and executive branches amid an outcry from Democrats that the Trump administration is stonewalling their investigations.\n\nTrump personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said earlier Tuesday that he would not cooperate with House investigators and that he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d that anyone from the Trump administration would appear before a Democratic-led panel investigating the president.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s comments came hours after the State Department blocked a scheduled deposition by Gordon Sondland, a key figure in the Ukraine controversy, prompting three House committee chairmen to announce that they would issue a subpoena.\n\nThe Democrats said they viewed the move as \u201cobstruction of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d while President Trump sought to justify it by calling the House committees investigating him a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said he would invite Giuliani to appear before his panel to testify about \u201ccorruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine\u201d \u2014 a prospect that Senate Democrats said they would welcome.\n\n\u25cfPoll: Majority of Americans say they endorse opening of House impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\n\u25cfHouse Democrats consider masking identity of whistleblower from Trump\u2019s GOP allies in Congress.\n\n\u25cfDemoralized State Department personnel question Pompeo\u2019s role in Ukraine crisis.\n\nRead the whistleblower complaint | The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky |What\u2019s next in the Trump impeachment inquiry\n\n7:30 p.m.: McCarthy says Trump \u2018is right to call out this rushed process\u2019\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) issued a statement Tuesday night supporting Trump\u2019s decision not to cooperate with House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is right to call out this rushed process because Democrats refuse to protect the transparency and basic fairness that have been integral to previous impeachment proceedings,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Pelosi sent a letter to House Democrats defending the inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe President will be held accountable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen it comes to impeachment, it is just about the facts and the Constitution.\u201d\n\n7:00 p.m.: House Democrats subpoena Sondland\n\nThree House Democratic committee chairs sent a letter Tuesday night formally subpoenaing Sondland. The subpoena compels Sondland to testify at a deposition on Oct. 16 at 9:30 a.m and to produce documents by Oct. 14.\n\n\u201cIn light of Secretary Pompeo\u2019s direct intervention to block your appearance before our Committees, we are left with no choice but to compel your appearance at a deposition pursuant to the enclosed subpoena,\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, wrote in the letter.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Gowdy expected to join Trump\u2019s legal team\n\nFormer congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) is expected to join Trump\u2019s legal team as an outside counsel, according to a senior White House official who said Gowdy met with White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney earlier Tuesday.\n\nTrump has blessed the move, the official added.\n\nGowdy is a former chairman of the House Oversight Committee; he also led the two-year House investigation into the 2012 terrorist attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nLike many in Trump\u2019s inner circle, he has been a regular fixture on Fox News Channel, both before and after his departure from the House in January.\n\n\u2014 Josh Dawsey\n\n6:10 p.m.: House Democrats respond to White House: Letter \u2019won\u2019t halt Congress one iota\u2019\n\nSeveral House Democrats took to Twitter on Tuesday night to denounce the letter sent by White House counsel Pat Cipollone to House leaders.\n\n\u201cTrump and his enablers continue to argue that the Constitution is unconstitutional,\u201d Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.) said. \u201cThis letter could\u2019ve been written by the same authoritarian goons trump admires so much. It\u2019s garbage and won\u2019t halt Congress one iota.\u201d\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who had briefly pursued a 2020 presidential bid, said Trump\u2019s actions show he has \u201ca guilty conscience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to imagine what would happen if while driving you saw police lights behind you and instead of pulling over, you sped away,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think you can\u2019t do that, then it\u2019s clear why @realDonaldTrump can\u2019t do that. But he is.\u201d\n\nAnd Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) argued that the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry warrants yet another article of impeachment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m confused here: The House wants, but does not need, the WH to conduct an impeachment inquiry; and obstruction of an impeachment inquiry is, itself, can be grounds for impeachment,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n5:45 p.m.: Louisiana Republican running for governor calls for Pelosi\u2019s expulsion\n\nRep. Ralph Abraham (R-La.) filed a House resolution Tuesday calling for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be expelled from Congress, citing the ongoing impeachment inquiry targeting Trump.\n\nAbraham is locked in a heated race for governor, and his resolution targeting Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2014 a despised figure among GOP voters \u2014 comes just days before Louisiana voters go to the polls Saturday for the first round of voting.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s vicious crusade against our lawfully-elected President is nothing more than a politically-motivated witch hunt and it must be stopped,\u201d Abraham said in a statement. \u201cShe has disgraced the people\u2019s House and weaponized the Speaker\u2019s gavel for her party\u2019s political gain.\u201d\n\nRecent polls show Democratic Gov. Jon Bel Edwards is on the cusp of securing a second term Saturday by winning an outright majority. Abraham is trying to both keep Edwards under 50 percent and outflank GOP businessman Eddie Rispone to win the right to challenge Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff.\n\nOnly five members have been expelled from the House since its founding in 1789 \u2014 most recently Rep. James A. Traficant (D-Ohio), who was ousted in 2002 after his conviction on federal corruption charges.\n\nA Pelosi spokesman dismissed the letter as a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d meant to bolster Abraham\u2019s teetering campaign ahead of Trump\u2019s planned visit to the state Friday.\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n5:30 p.m.: White House press secretary says Trump \u2018has done nothing wrong\u2019\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham defended Trump in a statement shortly after the release of the letter to House leaders.\n\n\u201cThe President has done nothing wrong, and the Democrats know it,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cFor purely political reasons, the Democrats have decided their desire to overturn the outcome of the 2016 election allows them to conduct a so-called impeachment inquiry that ignores the fundamental rights guaranteed to every American.\u201d\n\nShe accused Democrats of holding closed-door hearings to \u201cdeny the president the right to call witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses, to have access to evidence, and many other basic rights.\u201d\n\n5 p.m.: White House says it will not cooperate with House impeachment inquiry\n\nIn a scathing eight-page letter to House leaders, Cipollone wrote that House Democrats\u2019 recent actions violate \u201cthe Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent.\u201d He criticized the impeachment inquiry as attempt to overturn the 2016 presidential election results and to influence the upcoming 2020 campaign.\n\n\u201cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,\u201d Cipollone wrote.\n\nPelosi has said repeatedly that the House does not have to hold a formal vote to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe effort to impeach President Trump \u2014 without regard to any evidence of his actions in office \u2014 is a naked political strategy that began the day he was inaugurated, and perhaps even before,\u201d Cipollone wrote.\n\n4:30 p.m.: Pelosi tells Democrats: \u2018The President will be held accountable\u2019\n\nIn a letter to the House Democratic Caucus, Pelosi urged her members to address the impeachment inquiry they\u2019re undertaking \u201csomberly and prayerfully.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe actions taken by the President over the past two weeks show a defiance of our Founders, with a total disregard for their wisdom and the U.S. Constitution,\u201d Pelosi wrote.\n\nThen, mocking a phrase he used to describe himself in a tweet, she wrote, \u201cIn his \u2018great and unmatched wisdom,\u2019 President Trump must know that no one is above the law. The President will be held accountable. When it comes to impeachment, it is just about the facts and the Constitution.\u201d\n\nPelosi also accused Trump of \u201cobstructing justice, abusing power and diminishing the office of the presidency,\u201d which she said makes it all the more important that the legislative branch of government perform its role.\n\n4 p.m.: No comment from Sondland\u2019s attorney on subpoena\n\nRobert Luskin, Sondland\u2019s attorney, said he had no additional comment to make about Democrats\u2019 plans to subpoena his client for testimony on Capitol Hill. Sondland\u2019s legal team will review any subpoena when it is served, he added.\n\n\u2014 Carol D. Leonnig\n\n3:40 p.m.: Clinton to Trump: \u2018Don\u2019t tempt me.\u2019\n\nHillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, responded to Trump\u2019s suggestion that she could win the nomination next year over Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job,\u201d Clinton tweeted.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump had mused that Clinton \u201cshould enter the race to try to steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nClinton is currently on a book promotion tour with her daughter and co-author Chelsea Clinton.\n\n3:30 p.m.: House panel asks court to enforce Mueller-related subpoenas, a step toward possible impeachment\n\nJustice Department lawyers urged a federal judge Tuesday to deny a House Judiciary Committee request for grand jury materials in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation, arguing that in hindsight, courts in 1974 should not have given Congress the Watergate grand jury \u201croad map\u201d that led to President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s impeachment.\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of Washington, D.C., expressed astonishment at the position, calling it one of several \u201cextraordinary\u201d stances taken by Trump administration lawyers to oppose House subpoenas and witness testimony in a gathering impeachment investigation.\n\nThe debate centers on the 1974 decision in Haldeman v. Sirica, ultimately upheld by the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which found that a congressional impeachment investigation and trial satisfy an exception to grand jury secrecy rules provided for a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Spencer Hsu\n\n3:15 p.m.: Pocan says individual who blocked Sondland testimony may have broken the law\n\nRep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) send a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday requesting information on who instructed Sondland not to testify.\n\nPocan cited Section 713 of Division D of Public Law 116-6, which prohibits the payment of salary to any \u201cofficer or employee of the Federal Government who prohibits or prevents \u2026 any other officer or employee of the Federal Government from \u2026 communication or contact with any Member, committee, or subcommittee of the Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe the person prohibiting Ambassador Sondland from testifying before the House Intelligence Committee is in violation of this statute, and that their salary should be withheld until Ambassador Sondland appears before Congress,\u201d Pocan wrote.\n\n3 p.m.: Former State Dept. attorney says White House can\u2019t legally block Yovanovitch from testifying.\n\nHarold Koh, a former State Department legal adviser and current Yale Law School professor, said he sees \u201cno basis to legally block\u201d former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch from testifying Friday.\n\nBut Trump, through Pompeo, could say \u201cyou\u2019ll never work for the U.S. government again,\u201d in which case she could potentially suffer other consequences. He noted how FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired just hours before he was set to retire with full benefits.\n\nIf she receives some kind of letter asking her not to testify, but does so anyway, she could be further instructed by that letter not to answer questions that would violate executive privilege or that require recitation of classified material, Koh said in an email to The Post. A claim of violation of classification laws could expose her to prosecution under the Espionage Act and other laws, he said.\n\n\u201cPresumably Ambassador Yovanovitch would just say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to testify about privileged and classified matters\u2019 and then go on to testify truthfully and at length about other conversations\u201d \u2014 particularly, he said, text chains with other officials similar to the text disclosed to Congress by former Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker last week.\n\n\u2014 Ellen Nakashima\n\n2:45 p.m.: Career diplomats tell Pompeo to defend Yovanovitch\n\nMore than two dozen career and political diplomats who at one time worked with Yovanovitch wrote to Pompeo asking him to defend attacks on Yovanovitch.\n\nYovanovitch, they wrote, \u201crepresents the finest in the Foreign Service,\u201d and described her work as \u201cexemplary.\u201d\n\nWhich is why, they said, they were so disturbed to learn that during Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, he disparaged her and said, \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch, who was called back early from her Ukraine post, is scheduled to meet with congressional investigators on Friday.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Yovanovitch deserves your unstinting support, as do other career diplomats who may become ensnared in the upcoming Congressional investigation and impeachment process,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAll employees of the Department \u2014 Foreign Service officers, civil servants, and political appointees \u2014 need to know that you have their backs against scurrilous political attacks and smears.\u201d\n\nThose who signed include ambassadors who worked in Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\n2:35 p.m.: Trump \u2018must stop stonewalling,\u2019 Biden says\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden responded to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to block Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, from testifying by arguing that the president should cooperate with lawmakers.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump must stop stonewalling Congress and fully cooperate with the investigations,\u201d Biden said in a tweet. \u201cThe American people deserve the truth.\u201d\n\n1:45 p.m.: Schumer says Giuliani must be under oath if he testifies\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday that if Giuliani appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his testimony must be under oath.\n\n\u201cWe welcome Mr. Giuliani testifying,\u201d Schumer tweeted. \u201cGiven the apparent depth of his involvement in the president\u2019s effort to convince foreign governments to investigate a political rival, he must testify under oath.\u201d\n\nSchumer was referring to Trump\u2019s effort to persuade the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\n1:30 p.m.: Giuliani says he won\u2019t testify in House, \u2018can\u2019t imagine\u2019 others will\n\nGiuliani said Tuesday that he would not testify in front of the House Intelligence Committee and that he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d that anyone from the Trump administration would appear before the panel led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) either.\n\n\u201cThe position I\u2019m stating is now the position of the administration,\u201d Giuliani said in an interview in which he revealed that the administration has written a letter that will be released soon saying that Schiff\u2019s committee is illegitimate.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t testify in front of that committee until there is a vote of Congress and he [Schiff] is removed,\u201d Giuliani said, referring to Republican calls for a full House vote on an impeachment inquiry and the removal of Schiff as the committee\u2019s chairman.\n\n\u201cLet them hold me in contempt. We\u2019ll go to court. We\u2019ll challenge the contempt,\u201d Giuliani added.\n\nA White House spokesman declined to comment on Giuliani\u2019s remarks.\n\nGiuliani, meanwhile, said that he is \u201cvery interested\u201d in accepting Graham\u2019s officer to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee but that \u201cthere are a lot of legal issues to consider.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraham wants me to lay out in one place, in one time the Ukrainian collusion and the Biden corruption,\u201d Giuliani said, adding that the idea for him to testify was not his. \u201cI appreciate Lindsey offering the opportunity to lay the whole case out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how public Giuliani\u2019s testimony would be, if it even occurs. A spokeswoman for the Senate Judiciary Committee said it has yet to be determined whether Giuliani\u2019s appearance would be open or closed to the public. The committee also has not decided whether senators or staff would question Giuliani, she said.\n\n\u2014 Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim\n\n1 p.m.: Jimmy Carter says Trump is stonewalling, advises him \u2018to tell the truth\u2019\n\nFormer president Jimmy Carter reacted Tuesday to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to block Sondland from testifying, calling it \u201ca departure from custom and what American people expect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s going to be another item of evidence used against him if he continues to stonewall and prevent evidence to be put forward to the House and Senate to consider,\u201d Carter said during an appearance on MSNBC.\n\n\u201cMy advice to him would be to tell the truth and also to cut back on his Twitter feeds,\u201d Carter told host Andrea Mitchell. \u201cAnd give the House of Representatives, and also the Senate and the general public, the evidence that we need to form a case either for or against him.\u201d\n\n12:20 p.m.: Harris, Feinstein say they have questions for Giuliani\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) on Tuesday highlighted a potential dilemma for Giuliani as he decides whether he wants to take up Graham\u2019s offer to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn a tweet, Harris responded to Graham\u2019s announcement on Twitter that he asked Giuliani to share his concerns \u201cabout corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I have questions,\u201d tweeted Harris, who has earned a reputation for her aggressive questioning of witnesses before the committee, including now-Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nWhile testifying would offer Giuliani a chance to advance Trump\u2019s unproven contention that Biden and his son were involved in corruption, it would also provide the opportunity for Harris and other Senate Democrats to probe Giuliani\u2019s role in pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, made that clear in a statement shortly after Harris\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cI welcome the opportunity to question Rudy Giuliani under oath about his role in seeking the Ukrainian government\u2019s assistance to investigate one of the president\u2019s political rivals,\u201d she said. \u201cDemocratic members have plenty of questions for Mr. Giuliani and this would give us an opportunity to help separate fact from fiction for the American people.\u201d\n\n12:10 p.m.: Trump takes another shot at Schiff\n\nTrump lashed out anew at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who he has previously said should be removed from office.\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t Adam Schiff been fully discredited by now?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cDo we have to continue listening to his lies?\u201d\n\nThe president didn\u2019t spell out what he considered to be lies by Schiff.\n\n11:40 a.m.: House committees to issue subpoena to Gordon Sondland\n\nThree House committee chairmen announced that they would issue a subpoena to compel testimony from Sondland, hours after learning he had declined to appear for a deposition at the direction of the State Department.\n\n\u201cWe consider this interference to be obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d the three committee chairmen said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe will be issuing subpoena to Ambassador Sondland for both his testimony and documents.\u201d\n\nSchiff, Engel and Cummings issued the statement after Sondland was a no-show on Capitol Hill.\n\nSchiff said that the Trump administration had also directed Sondland not to share text messages relevant to the inquiry, which focuses on a July phone call in which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\n11 a.m.: Jeffries sends a pointed warning to Trump on Twitter\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), a key member of the House Democratic leadership team, sent a blunt warning to Trump on Twitter late Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cObstruction of a constitutionally mandated impeachment inquiry is a high crime and misdemeanor,\u201d Jeffries wrote, referring to the standard for impeachment of a president\n\nHis tweet came about two hours after news reports that the Trump administration was blocking Sondland from appearing before three House committees.\n\n10:20 a.m.: Trump campaign manager welcomes Giuliani testimony\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale took to Twitter shortly after Graham announced his invitation for Giuliani to testify, seemingly voicing his approval.\n\n\u201cOpen up Pandora\u2019s box! Let the Democrats dirty secrets out,\u201d Parscale tweeted.\n\n10:15 a.m.: Graham say he\u2019ll invite Giuliani to testify on Ukraine corruption\n\nGraham said Tuesday that he would invite Giuliani to testify before his panel about \u201ccorruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has pressed Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, and the firing of the prosecutor who had investigated it.\n\n\u201cHave heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by @RudyGiuliani about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin,\u201d Graham wrote on Twitter.\n\nGraham knocked the \u201cbehavior\u201d of the Democratic-led House and said \u201cit is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns,\u201d Graham said.\n\n10:10 a.m.: Trump seeks to put focus on Hillary Clinton\n\nAmid the back-and-forth over his impeachment inquiry, Trump on Tuesday sought to put a spotlight back on the controversy over Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state.\n\nHe suggested that Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, could win the nomination next year over Warren.\n\n\u201cI think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOnly one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department declined to prosecute Clinton following an FBI investigation into her email practices.\n\n[\u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 vs. the \u2018corrupt human tornado\u2019: How Clinton and Trump can\u2019t seem to quit each other]\n\n9:50 a.m.: Trump\u2019s Republican allies defend administration, attack Schiff\n\nFive of Trump\u2019s Republican allies in Congress defended the administration\u2019s decision to block the deposition of Sondland and accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) of conducting an unfair investigation.\n\n\u201cThis is a kangaroo court and Chairman Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo,\u201d said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who joined his colleagues in speaking to reporters after Schiff made a statement on Tuesday morning.\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), another defender of the president, called the House inquiry \u201ca political charade\u201d and \u201ca clown show.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) asserted that the American people \u201chave a right to know who the whistleblower is,\u201d but added he has no plans to force their unmasking.\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n9:35 a.m.: Schiff says Sondland\u2019s failure to appear \u2018strong evidence\u2019 of obstruction\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said the decision to block Sondland\u2019s appearance is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of obstruction of Congress, potentially another article of impeachment against Trump.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Schiff said that the State Department not only blocked Sondland\u2019s appearance but is preventing him from turning over text messages relevant to the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress, a coequal branch of government,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe president and secretary of state are taking actions that prevent us from getting the facts needed to protect the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nSchiff did not take questions from reporters.\n\n9:25 a.m.: Trump says Sondland would have faced a \u2018kangaroo court\u2019\n\nTrump said blocking Sondland\u2019s appearance was justified because he was scheduled to be deposed by \u201ca totally compromised kangaroo court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,\u201d Trump said in a tweet.\n\n9:10 a.m.: State Dept. order to Sondland draws condemnation from Democrats\n\nThe State Department\u2019s move to block Sondland from appearing before congressional committees on Tuesday drew swift condemnation from Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the obstructionism of the White House that has been taking place since the beginning of the year,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a Judiciary Committee member, said in an interview. \u201cWe have a lawless, runaway executive branch of government, and the president has ordered wholesale defiance of the lawful demands of Congress.\u201d\n\nRaskin said that the administration\u2019s actions \u201ccan be reduced to an article of impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a certain sense they are digging their own impeachment pit if they thumb their nose at the people\u2019s representatives,\u201d Raskin said.\n\nRep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) said blocking Sondland amounted to \u201cobstruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cSondland is a key witness to the President\u2019s attempts to seek campaign interference from Ukraine,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cThe President is obviously terrified of what Sondland might tell Congress.\u201d\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said the Trump administration\u2019s move showed \u201cconsciousness of guilt.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn innocent president allows his team to be interviewed. But a guilty one blocks testimony,\u201d Swalwell tweeted.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) planned to address reporters about the issue at 9:30 a.m.\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n8:50 a.m.: White House blocks Sondland deposition\n\nThe Trump administration on Tuesday blocked a planned deposition by Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSondland was scheduled to be deposed by lawmakers about his activities as Trump urged Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nText messages made public last week show that Sondland, whose portfolio does not include U.S.-Ukraine relations, inserted himself into the effort to obtain a commitment from Ukraine to launch the investigations. At the time, the government in Kiev was eagerly awaiting the release of nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid and the arrangement of a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Zelensky.\n\n[Officials\u2019 texts reveal belief that Trump wanted probes as condition of Ukraine meeting]\n\nIn one text message, Sondland wrote that Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable,\u201d apparently referring to a clear demonstration from Ukraine that it would undertake the investigations.\n\nSondland worked closely with Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, to shape U.S. foreign policy around Trump\u2019s desire to investigate Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 presidential election to undermine Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Shane Harris\n\n7:45 a.m.: Murphy seeks to simplify the case for impeachment\n\nWith Republicans laboring to undermine the impeachment inquiry, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) sought to simplify the story line on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMorning all,\u201d Murphy wrote in a morning tweet. \u201c1. The President tried to conspire with a foreign country to destroy his political opponents. 2. He sent out a transcript verifying this. 3. His aide released text messages detailing the conspiracy. 4. This isn\u2019t allowed in a democracy. Have a great day.\u201d\n\n7:15 a.m.: Leading Republicans resurrect May video of Rep. Al Green\n\nLeading Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), have resurrected a video clip of Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) expressing concerns that Trump will be reelected if he\u2019s not impeached.\n\nIn a tweet on Monday night, McCarthy shared the video from an appearance by Green on MSNBC, quoting him saying, \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if we don\u2019t impeach this president, he will get reelected.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what it looks like when Democrats are being honest,\u201d McCarthy wrote.\n\nMcCarthy made no mention of the fact that the clip was from May, long before the controversy over Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky ignited.\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway also shared the video clip of Green on Twitter on Tuesday morning.\n\nGreen has been an advocate of Trump\u2019s impeachment since 2017.\n\n6 a.m.: In new poll, majority of Americans say they endorse opening of House impeachment inquiry of Trump\n\nA majority of Americans say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of Trump, and nearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step and recommend that the president be removed from office, according to a poll.\n\nThe findings in the Washington Post-Schar School poll indicate that public opinion has shifted quickly against the president and in favor of impeachment proceedings in recent weeks as information has been released about Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian government officials to undertake an investigation into Biden, a potential 2020 campaign rival, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\n[Power Up: Trump is on shaky ground when it comes to impeachment, our new poll finds]\n\nPrevious Post-Schar School or Post-ABC News polls taken at different points throughout this year found majorities of Americans opposing the start of an impeachment proceeding, with 37 percent to 41 percent saying they favored such a step. The recent revelations appear to have prompted many Americans to rethink their position.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Dan Balz and Scott Clement\n\n5 a.m.: Trump continues push for Schiff to be \u2018Impeached!\u2019\n\nAmid a spate of tweets and retweets that continued past midnight, Trump renewed his call for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to be removed from office.\n\nIn one tweet, Trump shared a video of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) saying he supports a resolution censuring Schiff for his handling of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have seized on an opening statement by Schiff at a hearing in which he provided an embellished version of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Schiff later said his statement was partly parody and that Trump should have recognized that.\n\n\u201cAdam should be Impeached!\u201d Trump wrote in his tweet.\n\nWhile House members can be expelled from the chamber, they cannot be impeached.", "description": "The U.S. ambassador to the European Union was ordered by the State Department not to testify Tuesday as a newly released Washington Post-Schar School poll finds public opinion has shifted quickly against the president.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/05NGBV9PJ0g5x_NlAoEMJR1lQmY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJWPX6XJZII6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
