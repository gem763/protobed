Democrats spent three years trying to prove Donald Trump is a Russian pawn. Mitch McConnell is \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d Third party candidates are a Russian plot. The Bernie Sanders movement is not just a wasteland of racist and misogynist \u201cBros,\u201d but \u2014 according to intelligence agencies and mainstream pundits alike \u2014 the beneficiary of an ambitious Russian plot to \u201cstoke the divide\u201d within the Democratic Party. The Joe Rogan independents attracted to the mild antiwar message of Tulsi Gabbard are likewise traitors and dupes for the Kremlin.\n\nIf you\u2019re keeping score, that\u2019s pretty much the whole spectrum of American political thought, excepting MSNBC Democrats. What a coincidence!\n\nDemocrats now are assuming the role once played by Republicans of the Tom Delay era, who denounced everyone opposed to the War on Terror as \u201cSaddam-lovers.\u201d In the midst of this in 2003, the Washington Post protested the way American journalism was \u201cinfected with jingoism and intolerance.\u201d That was after Rupert Murdoch\u2019s New York Post ran a headline, \u201cDon\u2019t aid these Saddam-lovers\u201d about \u201cappeasement-loving celebs\u201d like Laurence Fishburne, Tim Robbins, Samuel L. Jackson, Sean Penn, Danny Glover, and Susan Sarandon.\n\nToday, the New York Post is the paper crying out against the \u201csad, sick conspiracy theories\u201d about Gabbard (an \u201cAssad-lover\u201d instead of a \u201cSaddam-lover\u201d), but some of the other players are the same.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matt Taibbi", "Rollingstone.Com Politics Political-Commentary"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
