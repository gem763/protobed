Chinese state-run television and conglomerate Tencent (TCEHY) refused to air the L.A. Lakers vs. Brooklyn Nets preseason game emanating from Shanghai. And many Chinese businesses have cut ties or distanced themselves with the offending Rockets, including sportswear company Li-Ning.\n\nCould the controversy affect major associated brands like Nike?\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s much ado about nothing,\u201d says Susquehanna equity analyst Sam Poser, who specializes in footwear and apparel.\n\nPoser was a guest on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe Ticker.\u201d He noted that Nike\u2019s 30-year history in China is one of the reasons why the NBA drama is not likely to affect the company.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese consumer thinks of Nike as a global brand and doesn\u2019t think of it as a U.S. brand,\u201d he said. Nike views itself in similar terms. During the company\u2019s Q1 earnings call CEO Mark G. Parker said: \u201cNIKE is the brand of China for China.\u201d\n\nIn Q1, the company saw a 27% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis in the region. The swoosh brand has also maintained double-digit growth in China every quarter for more than 5 years.\n\nPoser says that even if Nike did see some spillover from the NBA political drama, the damage would be minimal, as basketball only accounts for about 12% of the company\u2019s total sales.\n\nBasketball - NBA China Games - Los Angeles Lakers v Brooklyn Nets - Shenzhen, China - October 12, 2019.

You want what you want, and if you can\u2019t have it, you might want it more \u2026 And that\u2019s probably why you saw how quickly they get this game on. Maybe the son of the premier said, look, dad, I want to watch basketball.\u201d\n\nPoser is referring to the fact that Chinese company Tencent, which initially pulled NBA games, resumed streaming two NBA games on Monday. The analyst also reminds Yahoo Finance that Nike manufactures a significant amount of products in the country.\n\nWhen asked how does a company like Nike navigate the potentially treacherous waters of operating in China, Poser said the company should \u201cJust keep doing what [it\u2019s] doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNike is just gaining a ton of momentum and we haven\u2019t heard anything from them. I think if we hear something from them, then a lot of these questions become more germane, but they\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\n\nReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
