Turkey agreed with the United States on Thursday to pause its offensive into northeastern Syria for five days to allow the YPG to withdraw out of a planned \"safe zone\". The fragile truce had so far held up. In a statement, the defense ministry said an attack by the YPG with anti-tank and light weapons had struck Turkish soldiers carrying out a reconnaissance and surveillance mission in Tel Abyad. It said the attack was retaliated, and added that Turkey remained committed to the truce deal despite the violations.\n\nTurkey says Kurdish militia kills one soldier in northeast Syria despite ceasefire", "description": "Turkey says Kurdish militia kills one soldier in northeast Syria despite ceasefire", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
