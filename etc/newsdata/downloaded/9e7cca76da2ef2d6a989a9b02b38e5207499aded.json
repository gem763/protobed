By contrast, government spending in Finland, the highest in Europe, stands at 57%.\n\nMr. Riedl released the numbers just hours before Mr. Sanders and fellow Democratic presidential candidates were to take the stage in Ohio for a primary season debate.\n\nMr. Sanders does call for tax increases but would find only about $23 trillion over the budget window, leaving the federal government deep in a hole, Mr. Riedl said.\n\nMr. Sanders has brushed aside complaints about the cost of his plans. He said he expects Americans to happily open their wallets to higher taxes to pay for his health care vision. He also predicted their savings through government-sponsored health care would more than offset the higher taxes they would pay to cover costs of the program.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
