The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\"\n\nOpponents of Brexit said they would continue to fight against any deal.\n\n\"The fight to stop Brexit is far from over,\" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said in a statement.\n\n\"Boris Johnson's deal would be bad for our economy, bad for our public services, and bad for our environment.\n\n\n\n\"The next few days will set the direction of our country for generations, and I am more determined than ever to stop Brexit.\"\n\nWhat is Boris's deal?\n\nBoris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker Getty\n\nThe full terms of the draft deal between London and Brussels were published by the EU this morning.\n\nUnder the agreement the UK would leave the EU and almost entirely cut its existing trade and customs relationships with the bloc.\n\nHowever, Northern Ireland would retain closer links on customs with the EU, in order to prevent the need for a hard border on the Island of Ireland.\n\nThe agreement is highly controversial and has been rejected by Johnson's Northern Irish governing partners so far, because of fears that Northern Ireland will be kept effectively permanently tied to the European Union.\n\nJohnson's opponents in London also fear the deal could allow the rest of the UK to diverge from EU rules and regulations on labour laws and environmental protections.\n\nHowever, under the agreement the UK would be obliged to maintain a \"level playing field\" with the EU, which may assauge the fears of some opponents.\n\nRegardless of the terms of the deal, icreasing numbers of members of the UK parliament still believe Brexit can be stopped and want to block the deal in order to make way for a second referendum.", "description": "The UK prime minister  secured agreement from the EU for a new Brexit deal on Thursday morning after days of talks.", "authors": ["Adam Payne", "Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da71bd5cc4a0a30023046b7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
