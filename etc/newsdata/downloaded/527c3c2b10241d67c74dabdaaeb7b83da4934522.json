She explained that the important focus would be against whom the sanctions were levied; in this case, Turkish interior, defense, and energy ministers.\n\nErdogan has repeatedly said that Turkey won't be stopped in its Syrian invasion; last week, Erdogan said in a speech that Turkey \"will never stop this step. We will not stop no matter what anyone says,\" the Associated Press reported \u2014 the same day Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the US had planned crippling sanctions against Turkey, but wasn't yet putting them into effect.\n\nErdogan has not cowed in the face of rebuke, telling European countries who criticized his decision to invade Syria that he would send Syrian refugees living in Turkey into Europe. Even after the sanctions were announced, Turkish troops continue their march into Syria, with video showing Turkish-supported forces in the city of Manbij, where nearby US forces recently departed. US and Turkish troops had engaged in joint patrols there, Reuters reports, part of an effort to convince Erdogan not to invade.\n\n\"Erdogan is not going to be intimidated right now by sanctions, because he wants a cordon sanitaire,\" Ambassador Theodore Kattouf, president of Amideast, told PBS Newshour, referring to the proposed buffer zone that Erdogan wants in northeastern Syria. \"And it won't take him forever to get that done.\"\n\nTurkey wants to establish a so-called \"safe zone\" along the Syria border with the intent of resettling millions of Syrian refugees. The country views Kurdish soverneigty as a threat and is wary of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, because of their ties to the Kurdistan Worker's Party that Turkey and the US consider a terrorist organization.\n\nSo far, the sanctions seem to be having little effect on Turkey, either militarily or economically, although the US has threatened further sanctions and called for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nAccording to The Financial Times, the Turkish Lira was actually up against the dollar on Tuesday after sanctions \u2014 including a return to 50% tariffs on Turkey's steel exports and stopping \"a $100bn trade deal\" between the two countries \u2014 took effect.\n\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat who along with Sen. Lindsey Grahan (R-S.C.) suggested much stronger sanctions against Erdogan and the Turkish military last week, called Trump's sanctions \"pathetic,\" adding that Trump still plans to meet Erdogan in November. According to the Department of Commerce, Turkey's steel exports to all countries only account for 7.6% of its total exports, and the US market made up 5% of Turkey's steel export sales.\n\n\u2014Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen) October 14, 2019\n\nBut it's unclear if further sanctions will stop Turkey's invasion, as Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute told Reuters.\n\n\"The only thing that will stop them is if the regime or the Russians move in significant numbers to where they stop.\"", "description": "Trump's sanctions are doing nothing to stop Turkey's invasion into northern Syria. One Democrat urging stronger sanctions called them \"pathetic.\"", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da607e8cc4a0a0c4d5987c5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
