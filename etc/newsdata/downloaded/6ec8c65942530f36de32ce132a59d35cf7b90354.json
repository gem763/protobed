He was 78.\n\nThe Raiders and Pro Football Hall of Fame announced Brown's death but did not reveal a cause. He had been dealing with cancer.\n\n\"The entire Hall of Fame family mourns the loss of a great man,\" Hall of Fame President David Baker said in a statement. \"Willie Brown was the epitome of the Raiders motto of 'commitment to excellence' that was integral to the team's sustained success. He embodied virtues like passion, integrity, perseverance and always led by example. His character, on and off the field, made all those around him better.\"\n\nAl Davis acquired Brown for the Raiders in a trade from Denver in 1967 in one of the best moves he made during his Hall of Fame career running the Raiders.\n\nBrown went on to have a brilliant career over 12 years with Oakland, highlighted by his 75-yard interception return for a touchdown against Minnesota that helped the Raiders win their first Super Bowl following the 1976 season.\n\n\"His legendary performance on the field changed the way the cornerback position was played and his valued guidance as a coach, mentor and administrator permeated the organization and touched countless individuals both on and off the field,\" the team said in a statement. \"Willie's loss will leave a tremendous void, but his leadership and presence will always be a major part of the fabric of the Raiders Family.\"\n\nBrown was one of the game's best lockdown cornerbacks and fit perfectly in Davis' preferred bump-and-run style of defense on the Raiders. He intercepted 54 passes, was a first-team All-Pro five times in the AFL and NFL and made the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1984.\n\nHis most memorable play came in the Super Bowl against the Vikings on Jan. 9, 1977. With the Raiders leading the game 26-0 in the fourth quarter, Brown intercepted a pass from Hall of Famer Fran Tarkenton and raced for the score, prompting the iconic radio call from Raiders announce Bill King: \"He looks and throws ... intercepted by the Oakland Raiders Willie Brown at the 30, 40, 50 ... he's going all the way! ... Old Man Willie! ... Touchdown Raiders!\"\n\nBrown retired two seasons later. He was an assistant coach for the Raiders from 1979-88, was head coach at Long Beach State in 1991, coached at Jordan High School in 1994 and returned to the Raiders when they moved back to Oakland in 1995 as director of staff development.\n\nBrown was a regular presence around the team during that time, working with the cornerbacks and in more recent years announcing the team's picks during the annual NFL draft.\n\nOwner Mark Davis called Brown \"one of the greatest to ever play the game.\" He thanked Brown for how he treated his mother and Al Davis' widow, Carol Davis. Mark Davis said Brown always helped Carol Davis up and down the stairs on the plane, joined her for dinners on the road and came to her birthday and Mother's Day dinners each year.\n\n\"It was Willie who was her best friend,\" Mark Davis said. \"We loved and will miss you Willie.\"\n\n\"Going to miss you Willie! I'll never forget when you called my name on that stage to welcome me into the Raider family 4 life! Prayers to his family,\" quarterback Derek Carr wrote on Twitter .\n\nBrown played his college ball at Grambling under the great coach Eddie Robinson. He was undrafted after leaving school and was cut by the Houston Oilers in his first training camp in 1963.\n\nHe then signed with Denver and became a starter midway through his rookie year and was an AFL All-Pro in his second season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
