Tomorrow some 12,000 troops, 213 missile launchers, 105 aircraft will take part in fresh drills\n\nHe added that strategic bombers will also fire cruise missiles at test targets at several firing ranges.\n\nEarlier this month Russia's military published a video showing a test launch of the Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile from the Plesetsk base in the Arkhangelsk region.\n\nAccording to the Defence Ministry statement, the launch was successful, with the missile hitting its target in the Kamchatka region of Russia's Far East.\n\nThe RT-2PM2 Topol-M can carry a single warhead with an 800-kt yield, making it more than 50 times more powerful than the bomb dropped by the US on Japan that wiped out Hiroshima.\n\nRussia has expanded the scope of its military drills in recent years amid rising tensions with the West.\n\nHowever, the latest nuclear drills, dubbed Thunder 2019, are 'defensive' and not aimed against other states, Ilyin said, according to TASS news agency.\n\nThe general said: 'The strategic command and staff drills Thunder 2019 are aimed at practising the issues of training and employing strategic forces amid a threat of an aggression.\n\nRussia's Defence Ministry said that the latest war games will feature practice launches of missiles.

Foreign contingents will not be involved in the drills.'\n\nThe announcement comes as President Vladimir Putin visited Saudi Arabia to seal oil deals and use his influence to defuse rising tensions in the Gulf.\n\nThe meeting with King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman comes following attacks on Saudi oil installations that Riyadh and the US have blamed on Iran - an ally of Moscow.\n\nRussia has attempted to keep a foot in both camps - proposing missiles to Riyadh to defend itself, while at the same time warning against 'hasty conclusions' regarding Iranian involvement.\n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad, who was kept in power by Russian military might, was this week asked to help protest the Kurds from a Turkish bombardment after the US pulled out of the north of the war-torn country.", "description": "The Kremlin said three days of military exercises will begin tomorrow and involve 12,000 troops, 213 missile launchers, 105 aircraft, 15 surface warships and five submarines.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19699230-0-image-a-112_1571066808390.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
