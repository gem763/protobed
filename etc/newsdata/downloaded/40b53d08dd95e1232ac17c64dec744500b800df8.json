Impatient, even?\n\nI only ask because a new study intimates that technology's quest toward giving us everything from knowledge to burgers right now may be injecting a painful impatience into our veins.\n\nThe study of 2,000 Brits, performed on behalf of stationery company BIC, insists that the majority of respondents pointed to their gadgets as the prime source of their agitation.\n\nA dark picture is painted of humans' newly discovered proclivity to curse their machines and, who knows, the gods that made them.\n\nThe data-driven and congenitally curious might wonder, though, whether these British respondents are really all that impatient at all.\n\nYou see, in this study, it took an average of 22 seconds for people to express frustration if their TV or computer doesn't start streaming a movie properly.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm more of a 6 to 8 seconds sort of human. If Netflix or Amazon isn't immediately delivering, my toes begin to make involuntary curling motions, as does at least one of my lips.\n\nAnd then there's these Brits' apparent threshold for a webpage to load. It takes 16 seconds before they, I don't know, raise an eyebrow or emit a gentle snort.\n\nHaving grown up -- involuntarily -- in that country, I know that Brits embrace a legend for their ability to confront adversity with a stiff upper lip.\n\nI have a feeling, though, that if this study was repeated here in the US, the average patience breaking point would be around 2.7 seconds.\n\nThen again, it seems that the new, tech-incited swathe of impatience is sweeping the most cherished aspects of Brits' lives.\n\nThey're only prepared to wait 28 seconds for their kettles to boil, before they boil over themselves.\n\nOf course, this survey was set up to show that Brits have a remarkable tolerance for the arrival of a handwritten letter. They'll allegedly wait 3.8 days before getting annoyed their letter hasn't arrived.\n\nYet this survey surely highlights an accidental truth.\n\nCreating an expectation of instant delivery creates an increased inner pressure for instant gratification. We receive emails or other electronic messages and we feel compelled to reply instantly. And if someone, for whatever reason, doesn't reply to our messages instantly, we begin to twitch.\n\nSimilarly, the invention of Twitter and its ilk has created a demented repository of instant reaction that reveals a troubling impatience of thought and an even more troubling view of the truths of human character.\n\nTechnology creates the expectation that everything should move more quickly, as if this somehow makes humans more productive.\n\nIs it a surprise, then, that our patience runs out more quickly, too?", "description": "A survey suggests says that in our society of immediacy, our patience runs out within seconds.
