Hanks unveils his Mr. Rogers at festival", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - Ever since it was first announced, the idea of Tom Hanks playing Mr. Rogers has seemed like dream casting, a match as snug as a warm zip-up sweater.\n\n\u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,\u201d starring Hanks as the host of \u201cMister Rogers Neighborhood,\u201d premiered Saturday night at the Toronto International Film Festival, revealing a nuanced and layered performance by Hanks that goes well beyond the cardigan.\n\nThe film, which will open in theaters Nov. 22, isn\u2019t a Fred Rogers biopic but dramatizes the true story of magazine journalist (Matthew Rhys, playing a fictionalized version of writer Tom Junod) who went to Pittsburgh to profile Rogers for Esquire magazine.\n\nDirected by Marielle Heller (\u201cThe Diary of a Teenage Girl\u201d), \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d focuses on how an encounter with the hyper-sensitive, open-hearted Rogers transformed the cynical New York reporter. Hanks\u2019 performance is only a part of the drama, but his gentle, whole-body transformation into Rogers drew thunderous applause from festival audiences and rave reviews from critics. \u201cHanks isn\u2019t just good - he\u2019s transporting,\u201d wrote Variety.\n\n\u201cWe never make fun of Fred. We slow down to listen to him,\u201d Hanks said following the film\u2019s screening. \u201cIt was always going to be, I think, deconstructing the myth of it to show he was a regular guy who went out for Chinese food. At the same time, there is this mystery. What\u2019s his motivation?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the most wonderful things, too, is he was actually an ordained minister who never mentioned God on his show,\u201d Hanks said.\n\nHeller, whose \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d earlier this year garnered Oscar nominations for its leads (Melissa McCarthy, Richard E. Grant), questioned the idea that Hanks - \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d - was so naturally suited the part of Rogers.\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s this kind of thing that happens where everyone goes, \u2018Oh yeah, I love Tom Hanks. I love Mr. Rogers. This makes perfect sense,\u2019 \u201d Heller said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy performance to give. That\u2019s not something that Tom just walks in and puts on a sweater. That is an incredibly raw and vulnerable performance.\u201d\n\nThe life of Rogers, who died at age 74 in 2003, was last year chronicled in the documentary \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor\u201d - a film Hanks cited as part of his extensive research watching tapes of Rogers. With $12.4 million in ticket sales, it was the year\u2019s highest-grossing documentary, and its success suggested a widespread desire many feel to reconnect with Rogers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason that everybody feels so connect to him right now. I don\u2019t know. Some collective consciousness thing where we all want Mr. Rogers in our life right now, myself included,\u201d Heller said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could have pinpointed what that was when I started out on this journey. But the world feels pretty desolate right now and divided and angry.\u201d\n\nThe role could have easily tipped into saintly reverence, something Heller and Hanks were urged to avoid by Rogers\u2019 wife, Joanna Rogers. Her husband\u2019s altruism, she maintained, was hard work and not easily divined. Hanks said he regretted not absorbing Rogers\u2019 teachings earlier.\n\n\u201cI wish that when my son was three years old that he and I sat down and watched half an hour of \u2018Mr. Rogers\u2019 a week,\u201d said Hanks. \u201cI would have better understood the role of a parent in saying to their children: \u2018It\u2019s all right if you\u2019re sad.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe 63-year-old actor added, though, that his wife, Rita Wilson, is less enamored with how he has adopted the sayings and songs of Rogers.\n\n\u201cWhen my wife and I get into it, and when we\u2019re done with whatever subject matter got us all heated up,\u201d Hanks said, \u201cI\u2019m now driving her insane because I sing: \u2018It\u2019s good to talk/ It\u2019s good to share the things we feel/ It\u2019s good to talk.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ever since it was first announced, the idea of Tom Hanks playing Mr. Rogers has seemed like dream casting, a match as snug as a warm zip-up sweater.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Coyle"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/2019_tiff_a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood_90526_c0-411-4200-2859_s1770x1032.jpg?40e6dc6059659993ad4eccdad4a343fe38779705", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
