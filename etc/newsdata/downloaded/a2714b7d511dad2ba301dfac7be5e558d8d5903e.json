Her eight-piece backing band, all decked out in red and black, played with a soulful subtly that bolstered Brittany Howard's tender songs about her family \u2014 stories of a mixed-race child growing up in Alabama.\n\nAll the songs performed at the Tiny Desk come from Jaime, an album Brittany Howard dedicated to her sister who died at the age of 13 from a rare form of eye cancer, the same disease that has left Brittany Howard partially blind in one eye. On these songs (and in particular at this Tiny Desk Concert), there is more nuance than I've heard in Brittany's past projects, including her work with Alabama Shakes and Thunderbitch. The music has a sense of wonder and playfulness, even when the subject is heavy, as in \"Georgia.\" She tells the audience that it's a tale of \"a little young, black, gay girl having a crush on an older black girl and not knowing what to say and how I was feeling.\"\n\nBrittany Howard knows how to tell a story, to foster empathy and understanding and, in this intimate setting, the songs feel at home. The connection with the audience felt visceral as I looked around the room and into the eyes of my workmates and their friends. Even a small child in the arms of their parent screamed at the appropriate moment during the climax of Brittany's song, \"Baby.\" It gave us all a good laugh just when the weight of the words felt the heaviest.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Stay High\"\n\n\"Georgia\"\n\n\"Baby\"\n\n\"Goat Head\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nBrittany Howard: vocals, guitar; Nate Smith: drums; Alex Chakour: guitar; Brad Allen Williams: guitar; Zac Cockrell: bass; Lloyd Buchanan: keys; Paul Horton: keys; Shanay Johnson: vocals; Karita Law: vocals\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame, Beck Harlan, CJ Riculan; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Laura Beltran Villamizar/NPR", "description": "The Alabama Shakes singer and guitarist brought an eight-piece backing band to the Tiny Desk for a set of deeply personal and affecting songs.", "authors": ["Bob Boilen"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/10/howard_wide-e3880a2e2bde0a4d0a6393bf2094697af70df088.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
