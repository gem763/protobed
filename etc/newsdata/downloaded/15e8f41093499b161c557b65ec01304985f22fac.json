They will become the first line of defence in conservation.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yendegaia national park in the far south, to which the Tompkins Foundation donated land in 2013. Photograph: Tompkins Conservation\n\nWhile the main hubs of Chilean Patagonia \u2013 Punta Arenas, Puerto Montt, Balmaceda, and the Torres del Paine national park \u2013 already have well-established tourist infrastructure, Tompkins hopes communities across the region will see the Route of Parks as an opportunity to start tourism ventures for all budgets. \u201cWe want backpackers and people who can only afford to camp \u2013 we want an assortment of offers.\u201d\n\nA team from the foundation has already travelled around Patagonia visiting towns and villages to talk about the reason for the parks\u2019 existence \u2013 to \u201cthrow the brake on the extinction crisis\u201d by restoring the landscape to its natural state and where necessary reintroduce endangered species \u2013 and to encourage local people to establish tourist services that will create income for communities and contribute to the long-term preservation of wild habitat.\n\nThe Tompkins Foundation has developed trails and infrastructure in two of the five new parks, Parque Patagonia and Pumal\u00edn \u2013 the former has two small lodges, three campgrounds and a visitor centre; the latter has nine cabins and a network of campgrounds. But the aim is for communities to develop low-impact accommodation, guide and transport services, cultural tours and more around all the parks.\n\nAs a result, vast swaths of Patagonia such as the spectacular but overlooked Ays\u00e9n region will become more accessible, taking the pressure off Torres del Paine, where the W trail is so busy in peak season that travellers have complained of overcrowding.\n\nUK-based travel company Pura Aventura, which has been selling holidays to Patagonia for 20 years, said the work of the Tompkins Foundation was a game-changer for tourism. \u201cFrom our point of view it\u2019s very exciting that an organisation with the heft of Tompkins is opening this [region] up because it means an almost endless supply of extraordinary places become accessible in a way that\u2019s not going to be harmful. It\u2019s about being able to travel in good conscience,\u201d said co-owner Thomas Power.\n\nCan the world's most ambitious rewilding project restore Patagonia's beauty?

The launch of the route \u2013 which is broken down into different itineraries on the website \u2013 follows the creation of five new national parks and the expansion of three others, all in Chilean Patagonia after the Tompkins Foundation handed over a million acres to the Chilean state \u2013 the largest private donation of land ever.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cerro Castillo, in the national park of the same name.\n\nThe handover was the culmination of 25 years of strategic land acquisition by Kristine and Douglas (who died in a kayaking accident in 2015), aimed at returning farmed land to its natural state and creating wildlife corridors. The Foundation also owns land in Argentina, where its flagship rewilding project is seeing species being reintroduced to the newly created Iber\u00e1 national park in the north-west. In January, three jaguars will be introduced. In total the Tompkins\u2019 philanthropic work amounts to $345m.\n\nTompkins said she was still shocked at the successful outcome of her and her husband\u2019s vision which began in 1991 with the purchase of 200,000 acres at the toe of Re\u00f1ihu\u00e9 Fjord in what is now Pumal\u00edn national park. \u201cWe made the outrageous proposal to create five parks and expand three more and I\u2019m still dumbfounded that it reached its conclusion.\u201d\n\nAs a result 91% of Chile\u2019s protected land is in Patagonia.\n\nOver the decades a multitude of rewilding projects have included removing 25,000 sheep and 500 miles of fencing in what is now Parque Patagonia, the recovery of endemic species including guanacos, Andean deer, and Darwin\u2019s rhea and encouraging well-managed agriculture to serve as biophysical buffers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Crossing a footbridge in Pumali\u0301n national park.

The next phase is ensuring its long-term protection by setting up Amigos de los Parques (Friends of the Parks), a scheme to encourage Chileans to feel a pride in their national parks system; a private-public fund to ensure the parks are properly maintained; and the establishment of the Route of Parks to promote the region locally, nationally and internationally.\n\nTompkins said she was conflicted when it came to tourism. She believes it can be a force for good where it contributes to the restoration of nature, but should be managed with stricter controls. \u201cTourism is by nature skimming the cream off the natural and cultural top. [Visitors] need to leave more behind than just paying for a dinner. Personally, I think there should be more tourism taxes. And then the government has to know how to use that money.\u201d\n\nLooking back over 25 years of philanthropic work, she said her proudest achievement was the creation of Kaw\u00e9sqar national park, a vast region of mountains, forests, glaciers, fjords, lakes, wetlands and valleys of the west coast. The Tompkinses owned 28,000 hectares of it and used it as leverage to persuade the state to give 4 million hectares to form the second-largest national park in Chile (after Bernardo O\u2019Higgins). About 26,000sq km of surrounding water is also protected.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Parque Nacional Queulat, Patagonia\n\nFuture conservation work will focus on areas where land meets sea with the aim of winning protection for marine areas. Ever ambitious, Tompkins is going for the highest level of protection there is: \u201cWe are trying to get waters established as no-take zones.\u201d\n\nAlongside the continued conservation work across the region, Tompkins said she wanted to position the foundation as a supporter of the youth climate activism movement, both financially and in terms of direct involvement. \u201cI personally want to be involved and I want my teams to be involved. We should be joining the marches. If there is no march in an area where we work, we should help support one.\n\n\u201cI listened to Greta\u2019s speech at the United Nations summit and I can\u2019t remember feeling this way in over 30 years. It\u2019s brilliant. I have zero faith in governments but I see hope in the work we do and in Greta and her pals. We have to join them [young people]. If we have any moral compass this is the time and I will be there.\u201d\n\n\u2022 See a comprehensive map of the Route of Parks", "description": "Patagonia\u2019s dramatic wildernesses are opening up to visitors, but the growth in tourism will be married to conservation and locals\u2019 needs, says the woman behind the project", "authors": ["Isabel Choat"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a2f2cdde020ce58a977d926a671e2cfea1ceb1d/0_242_5295_3178/master/5295.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdb67a4e0bbcde8d1c4560e2a60fff2f", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
