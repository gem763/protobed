His critics within his party have included Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator Mitt Romney, and the late Senator John McCain. But still, many Republican members of Congress have chosen not to criticize the president publicly. Even despite various reports that it's a very different story in private.\n\nBut Trump's recent pulling US military support of the Kurds, and the aftermath, has caused near-universal outrage.\n\nEven some of Trump's most steadfast defenders have slammed the decision. It's unclear how many of them have chosen not to support the president for re-election anymore. But apparently there's at least one.\n\nShimkus formally withdraws his support\n\nJohn Shimkus has been a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives since 1997. He has frequently been an ally of the Trump administration. Including during the Mueller investigation and more recently, when the scandal over Ukraine emerged.\n\nBut apparently the move to leave the Kurds behind is a bridge too far. Politico reports that Shimkus requested his name be removed from the Trump re-election campaign's list of supporters. Shimkus hasn't said if he's throwing support behind any of Trump's challengers in the Republican presidential primary. The field of challengers currently stands at three. Former Governor Bill Weld, former US Representative Joe Walsh, and former Governor and US Representative Mark Sanford.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most.

He has also said he's 'saddened,' 'heartbroken' and 'embarrassed.' Shimkus also seems to be showing something of a break over Ukraine, saying that he's troubled by the reports.\n\nShimkus is a long-time veteran of the U.S. Army. He graduated from West Point and served for nearly 30 years, between Active and Reserve status. An Army Ranger, he retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nHas been in politics for 30 years\n\nShimkus was elected a trustee of Collinsville Township, Illinois, in 1989. Soon after, he was elected treasurer of Madison County, Illinois.\n\nHe first ran for Congress in 1992. Shimkus lost that year to the Democratic incumbent, Dick Durbin. Durbin has since moved onto the Senate and is the current Senate minority whip. Shimkus later won the seat in 1996. He initially represented the 20th District of Illinois.\n\nThe area has been re-districted twice, becoming the 19th District and now the 15th District.\n\nThe district is a vast one, covering much of the Illinois borders with Indiana and Kentucky. It also extends through part of central Illinois over to suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri, where Shimkus hails from.", "description": "His decision comes after Trump opted to leave Kurdish allies behind in Syria.", "authors": ["Asmir Pekmic", "Susan B.", "Read More On The Same Topic Samantha Spencer", "Former All-Star Andy Etchebarren Dies At Age", "Canada", "Incumbents Have Historically Bad Showing In The Northwest Territories", "Injury-Ridden Grinnell Pioneers Football Team Forfeits Remainder Of Its Season"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/10/os/b_1200x630/gop-congressman-drops-support-for-trump-over-despicable-syria-image-via-abcnewsyoutube_2337345.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
