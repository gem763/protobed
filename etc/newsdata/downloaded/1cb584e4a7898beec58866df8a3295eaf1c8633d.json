We talked about Otto.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump invited Mr. Warmbier\u2019s parents, Fred and Cindy Wambier of Cincinnati, Ohio, for the dinner at the White House last Saturday night. Otto Warmer died in 2017 shortly after the Trump administration gained his release from captivity in North Korea, where he spent 17 months in prison after being convicted of trying to steal a propaganda poster.\n\nHe died at age 22 after being returned to the U.S. in a coma. North Korea has denied he was mistreated.\n\nMr. Trump praised his top hostage negotiator and newly appointed national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, but said the previous administration should have pressed sooner for Mr. Warmbier\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cPeople should have moved faster,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe was there for a long time. With hostages, you have to move fast. Sometimes it\u2019s just too late. We got him [Mr. Warmbier] home but he was in horrible, horrible condition.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
