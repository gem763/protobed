Fantasy owners were treated to a glimpse of the future as a pair of burgeoning fantasy aces, Zac Gallen and Chris Paddack, traded zeroes into the late innings of this contest. Gallen, whom the Diamondbacks acquired from the Marlins at the trade deadline earlier this summer, authored the most dominant performance of his young major-league career in this one, carrying a no-hit bid into the seventh inning before giving up a one-out single to Manny Machado. He allowed only four base runners and recorded eight strikeouts over seven scoreless frames. He was credited with a win thanks to the efforts of Ketel Marte, who clobbered a go-ahead grand slam -- his 30th round-tripper of the season -- in the bottom of the seventh inning. The 24-year-old righty has allowed three earned runs or fewer in 13 consecutive starts to begin his big-league career and owns a pristine 2.50 ERA, 1.23 WHIP and 82/32 K/BB ratio across 68 1/3 innings of work. Simply put, he looks like a potential upper-echelon fantasy starter for years to come.\n\nNot to be outdone, Paddack, the 23-year-old Padres\u2019 rookie sensation held up his end of the bargain whiffing eight batters over 5 2/3 scoreless frames of his own. He racked up a whopping 11 swinging strikes, including six on just 24 changeups, in just 90 pitches. The Texas native has tailed off a bit in the second-half, after a remarkable start to the year, but has bounced back nicely in his last two starts, allowing just one run over 12 1/3 innings with a 16/2 K/BB ratio during that span. He owns a sparkling 3.54 ERA, 1.02 WHIP and 137/29 K/BB ratio across 129 2/3 innings (24 starts) this season. There may not be a pitcher in the big leagues with a higher long-term ceiling than Paddack if it all comes together.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass.

It\u2019s about whether or not you get back up and keep grinding. After coughing up a six-run lead in the ninth inning against the Nationals on Tuesday night, suffering one of the most devastating losses in recent memory, it would\u2019ve been easy for the Mets to roll over in an afternoon matinee nearly 12 hours later. Led by rookie sensation Pete Alonso, who clobbered his major league-leading 45th round-tripper of the season, the Mets responded with an electrifying 8-4 victory on Wednesday to keep their playoff hopes alive, remaining fewer than five games (four and a half to be exact) out of the final Wild Card spot in the National League.\n\nThe 24-year-old first baseman launched a towering solo shot to left field off Nationals\u2019 starter Anibal Sanchez -- who was lit up for a season-high seven runs over five frames -- in the fifth inning to give the Mets a commanding three-run lead in Wednesday\u2019s intra-divisional series finale and also reclaim solo possession of the big-league lead in long balls. He\u2019s now one home run ahead of both Angels\u2019 slugger Mike Trout and Dodgers\u2019 sensation Cody Bellinger. He\u2019s also two clear of Brewers\u2019 standout Christian Yelich. With 23 games remaining in his rookie campaign, Alonso is only seven big flies shy of Aaron Judge\u2019s single-season rookie record of 52, a mark he established two years ago. He owns a remarkable .267/.367/.593 triple-slash line with 86 runs scored, 45 home runs, 105 RBI and one stolen base in 594 plate appearances this season.\n\n\u201cIt feels pretty good,\u201d Alonso told reporters after the contest regarding his ownership of the home run lead entering the late stages of the regular season. \u201cI feel really, really fortunate. I\u2019m really happy with how I\u2019ve been performing, and this year\u2019s not over yet. I just need to keep on playing well, capitalizing on good pitches, and keep trying to help this team win.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Alonso\u2019s latest exploits, the Mets also got an additional boost from the return of veteran second baseman Robinson Cano, who went 3-for-3 with a pair of RBI and runs scored -- reaching safely in all four of his plate appearances -- in his first game since August 4. The injury-plagued 36-year-old infielder missed the last four weeks with a torn hamstring, but stuffed the stat sheet with a pair of singles and a two-run homer in the fourth inning of this one. When he\u2019s fully healthy, he\u2019s still a difference maker at the plate.\n\nReynolds Rallies Pirates Past Marlins\n\nRookie outfielder Bryan Reynolds has quietly served as the Pirates\u2019 primary offensive table setter for the duration of the 2019 campaign. The unheralded 24-year-old has flown under the radar in comparison to the flashy names headlining this season\u2019s exceptional rookie class, but he managed to grab a few headlines on Wednesday night, propelling Pittsburgh to a 6-5 comeback victory over the Marlins. He delivered the first walk-off hit of his major-league career, slicing a two-run, walk-off single to shallow left field off newly-minted Marlins\u2019 stopper Jose Urena in the bottom of the ninth inning, lifting the Pirates to their fifth win in their last six contests. As if his late-inning heroics at the plate weren\u2019t enough, he was also responsible for the defensive highlight of the evening, making a remarkable diving grab in the left-center field gap to rob Magneuris Sierra of extra-bases back in the sixth inning. He won\u2019t win the National League\u2019s Rookie of the Year Award, thanks to the surreal campaign put together by Mets\u2019 phenom Pete Alonso, but he\u2019s put together one of the most remarkable rookie seasons in recent memory. His .332 batting average ranks second in the major leagues, trailing only Nationals\u2019 superstar Anthony Rendon (.338), this season. He has a realistic chance to become the first rookie to win a batting title in the National League. He owns a sublime .332/.398/.525 triple-slash line with 75 runs scored, 14 home runs, 62 RBI and a pair of stolen bases in 470 plate appearances.\n\nAL Quick Hits: Astros GM Jeff Luhnow said Wednesday morning on Houston's SportsTalk790 that George Springer (head, neck) \"may need a day or two.\" Barring a setback, he could potentially return to action before the end of this week \u2026 Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Gio Urshela (groin) will likely be activated from the injured list on Sunday \u2026 Luis Severino (shoulder, lat) will make another rehab appearance Friday with Double-A Trenton \u2026 Giancarlo Stanton (knee) reportedly headed to the Yankees' spring training complex on Wednesday to begin facing live pitching \u2026 Max Kepler left Wednesday's game against the Red Sox with soreness in his upper chest area \u2026 Mookie Betts went 4-for-5 with a pair of home runs and five RBI to power the Red Sox past the Twins \u2026 Jorge Soler walloped his 40th round-tripper of the season in the Royals\u2019 victory over the Tigers \u2026 Franmil Reyes went 2-for-3 with a two-run homer to propel the Indians past the White Sox \u2026 Tim Anderson went 3-for-5 with a two-run dinger in the losing effort \u2026 Shane Bieber whiffed nine batters over seven innings to collect his 13th win of the season in that contest \u2026 Nick Wittgren came on in relief of Brad Hand to record his fourth save of the year in that one \u2026 Aaron Judge belted his 20th round-tripper of the season in the Yankees\u2019 win over the Rangers \u2026 Tanner Roark struck out six batters over 6 2/3 scoreless innings in a win over the Angels \u2026 Nomar Mazara is dealing with tightness in his oblique \u2026 Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto announced Wednesday that J.P.
