There are tentative signs that the selling phase may be over, although this could change very quickly in the event US-China trade talks collapse.\n\nOngoing US-China trade uncertainty has been among the reasons the Reserve Bank of Australia has been cutting aggressively in recent months, hurting the Australian dollar. That\u2019s because China is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, so what happens at the world\u2019s second largest economy matters greatly for Down Under. But mild expectations that there will be some sort of a deal at the conclusion of this week\u2019s meeting between trade representatives of the US and China has helped to put a stop in the selling for now.
