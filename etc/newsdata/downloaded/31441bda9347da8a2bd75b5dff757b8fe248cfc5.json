(Reuters) - Arm Holdings, the semiconductor technology firm owned by Softbank Group Corp (9984.T), still plans to return to the public markets by 2023, its chief executive said on Tuesday.\n\nArm Holdings Inc Chief Executive Simon Segars speaks at the company's annual user conference in San Jose, California, U.S., October 8, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Nellis\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at Arm\u2019s annual user conference in San Jose, California, CEO Simon Segars said \u201ca lot of things need to fall into place\u201d before the company can return to the public markets. However, the 2023 goal date for a relisting set by Softbank chief Masayoshi Son remains unchanged.\n\nThe Japanese telecommunications carrier acquired the British chip firm for $32 billion (26.2 billion pounds) in 2016. Last year, Son said it aims to re-list Arm within five years.\n\nThe returns on Softbank\u2019s Arm investment have taken on increasing importance as some of the investments made by Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund, such as Slack Technologies (WORK.N) and Uber Technologies (UBER.N), have performed poorly on the public markets.\n\nSoftbank Group is locked in talks with WeWork over a new $1 billion investment to enable the shared office space company to go through a major restructuring, Reuters reported on Monday. Sofbank is the largest shareholder in WeWork, which had to abandon an initial public offering last week because of investor concerns about how it was valued and its business model.\n\nSoftBank has been reluctant to plough more cash into WeWork but now believes that a fresh investment is necessary in order to have any hope of salvaging the investment it has already made, a source told Reuters.\n\nSegars, who is on Softbank\u2019s board of directors, declined to comment on the WeWork situation or other Vision Fund matters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not spending my days worrying about what is going on at Vision Fund. My primary focus is on delivering an Arm strategy,\u201d Segars said. \u201cThe Vision fund is going to do what it needs to do.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Arm, the dominant supplier of technology for mobile phone chips, has seen slow revenue growth with the declining smart phone market while new fields such as automotive chips have yet to begin growing quickly.\n\nSegars said Arm has purposely taken steps like boosting headcount, which has increased costs, to pursue opportunities that will pay off years later, rather than in the next quarter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been investing our profits in growing the company,\u201d Segars told reporters.", "description": "Arm Holdings, the semiconductor technology firm owned by Softbank Group Corp <9984.T>, still plans to return to the public markets by 2023, its chief executive said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438601455&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971VW", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
