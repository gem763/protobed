This is about love for America, certain people hate our country,\" he tweeted on Tuesday, while repeating the same message to a rally on Wednesday.\n\nInternational condemnation has rained down over the comments. British Prime Minister Theresa May called them \"completely unacceptable\". New Zealand's leader Jacinda Ardern said she \"completely and utterly\" disagreed with Trump.\n\nWhile usually refraining from commenting on other countries' domestic politics, Merkel on Friday had markedly sharp words about Trump's latest attacks.\n\nQuestions over racism are particularly sensitive in Germany given its Nazi past, and the government routinely speaks out forcefully in favour of tolerance and diversity.\n\nMarked differences\n\nTrump and Merkel's relationship had been strained from the start, with the US leader haranguing the German chancellor even before he took office.\n\nDuring his election campaign, the US property mogul called Merkel's decision to take in a million asylum seekers a \"catastrophic mistake\" and suggested that she was \"ruining Germany\".\n\nWhile Merkel had shared a visibly warm relationship with former US president Barack Obama, her contact with Trump has been formal and firm.\n\nBesides the striking differences in their personalities, the trained German physicist with a deliberative approach and the brash US billionaire known for his Twitter outbursts also have contrasting views and stances on policies.\n\nSetting the tone in her first phone call with Trump after he took office, Merkel offered cooperation, but also reminded him of democratic values.\n\nThat unusual warning led some commentators to suggest she had taken on the mantle of the \"leader of the free world\", a title usually reserved for US presidents.\n\nSince then, Trump has repeatedly ripped into Germany for failing to pay its \"fair share\" for transatlantic defence.\n\nHe has also lashed out against Germany's vital export industry which he claims is harming US producers.\n\nThe fraught ties and Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris climate accord led Merkel to draw the startling conclusion that the US may no longer be a reliable partner for Germany and the European Union.\n\nEurope must step up as a player in world affairs, Merkel said in 2017, signalling that the EU needs to take control of its destiny in the Trump era.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
