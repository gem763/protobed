It has also invested heavily in compliance to fight financial crime and money laundering, an issue that has shaken the Nordic bank industry.\n\nThe Stockholm-based bank said it planned to cut annual spending by about 1.5 billion crowns (\u00a3121 million) and booked restructuring charges of 900 million crowns in the third quarter.\n\nDented by the charge, net profit fell to 3.57 billion crowns (\u00a3287 million) from 4.11 billion crowns last year.\n\nAnalysts had expected earnings of 4.11 billion crowns, according to Refinitiv data. But the estimates did not include restructuring charges.\n\nShares in Handelsbanken, down marginally this year, fell 2.5% by 1002 GMT, reversing initial earlier gains on Wednesday.\n\nNordic banks shares were broadly weaker, which a banking analyst blamed on higher-than-expected costs for anti-money laundering measures, signs of an economic slowdown and tough competition.\n\nHandelsbanken's strategy of expanding west rather than east, primarily in Britain, mean it has not become embroiled in Baltic money laundering scandals that have engulfed Nordic rivals Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> and Swedbank <SWEDa.ST>.\n\nBut the Swedish lender, which has retained a large network of independent branch offices, has faced criticism over mounting costs for modernising IT systems and its overseas expansion.\n\nChief Executive Carina Akerstrom, who took the helm this year, had said in July that an ongoing review of the bank's operations was likely to result in job cuts.\n\nThe bank said on Wednesday it would gradually wind down its relatively small business in Asia and pull out of Germany, to focus instead on Nordic markets, Britain and the Netherlands.\n\nHandelsbanken said it would also increasingly focus on areas where it already had a strong presence, such as mortgage lending and services for small- and medium-size companies.\n\nIt said it expected two thirds of cost cuts to be carried out by the end of 2020 with the final third implemented in 2022. It said the moves would shave about 500 million crowns off revenues.\n\nThe bank said it expected development spending in 2020 to remain at the 2.1 billion to 2.2 billion crown level anticipated for this year. It also said costs to combat money laundering would rise to around 1.2 billion crowns this year from 600 million in 2018.\n\nJP Morgan said in a research note that Handelsbanken's restructuring plans were \"a step in the right direction\" but predicted cuts to average earnings estimates.\n\nThe bank's total costs, a closely watched metric, were also affected by restructuring charges. Total costs rose to 6.28 billion crowns from 5.16 billion crowns in the same period a year ago, higher than analyst forecasts for 5.46 billion crowns.\n\nAll Sweden's top three banks published results on Wednesday.\n\nSEB <SEBa.ST> reported higher-than-expected third-quarter net profit amid robust corporate demand for its advisory services and lending business. Its shares also fell 2.9%.\n\n\"Despite a softening macroeconomic environment and a seasonal slowdown, clients remained active in the third quarter,\" said SEB Chief Executive Johan Torgeby said.\n\nRival Swedbank's dipped 6.5% after the bank said net earnings would fall more than expected due to costs to address money-laundering issues this year.\n\nNordea, which moved its headquarters to Finland from Sweden last year, is due to publish its earnings report on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Niklas Pollard and Colm Fulton; Additional reporting by Johan Ahlander; Editing by Johannes Hellstrom and Edmund Blair)", "description": "Handelsbanken  said on Wednesday it would cut 800 jobs and pull out of Asia and Germany as it seeks to cut costs after restructuring charges dragged down the Swedish bank's third-quarter earnings.
