They\u2019re seeking lower nurse-to-patient ratios and say they\u2019re being forced to work overtime.\n\nIn preparation for the strike, the 618-bed hospital reduced services. Chief nurse Debra Albert says the hospital moved dozens of babies and children under intensive care to other hospitals.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The University of Chicago Medical Center prepared for a walkout by about 2,200 nurses by diverting ambulances and moving patients.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
