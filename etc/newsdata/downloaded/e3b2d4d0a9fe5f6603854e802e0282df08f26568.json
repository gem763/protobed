Bernie Sanders won one of the most coveted endorsements in the Democratic presidential primary this week from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a political coup that some pundits theorized could inject fresh life into his fading campaign.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBoth Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren made an aggressive pitch to the star freshman congresswoman, an influential voice among young Democrats.\n\nBut, while the 78-year-old Sanders was in a Nevada hospital after a heart attack, Ocasio-Cortez called to say she was coming aboard his campaign, months before she was expected to issue an endorsement, according to Politico. She\u2019s expected to formally announce her decision at a rally in Queens, New York on Saturday afternoon, which The Washington Post first reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAnother member of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d of four liberal congresswomen, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, also endorsed Sanders. Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib is expected to endorse the 2020 hopeful, as well.\n\nThe high-profile endorsements come amid Warren\u2019s surge in early-state and national polls, as Sanders falls to a distant third.

He has a hard ceiling of support, and an endorsement by the least popular politician in the country only cements that.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Both Sanders and Massachusetts Sen.
