Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite futures were all up about 0.1%.\n\nOf course, some individual shares move even when things look serene.\n\nSoftware provider Zscaler \u2019s stock (ticker: ZS) was down almost 19% in premarket trading after the company reported results for its fiscal fourth quarter. Earnings were stronger than Wall Street anticipated, but sales and forecasted earnings for next year came in below the Street\u2019s estimates.\n\nGameStop (GME) shares were down almost 16% after the company reported second-quarter numbers. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 11.6% from the second quarter last year.\n\nMallinckrodt (MNK) shares, on the other hand, rose almost 14%. The stock has ranged from $1.50 to $3.88 over the past five trading days as the company deals with litigation over the opioid crisis.\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) shares could move after the company announced it was selling some Baker Hughes (BHGE) stock. The sale will take GE\u2019s stake in the energy services company below 50%, changing the accounting treatment and generating a noncash charge. The new accounting treatment doesn\u2019t affect cash flow, however, and GE has said repeatedly it would dispose of its Baker stake in an orderly manner. The cash coming in is likely earmarked for debt reduction. GE shares were down 0.2%.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) shares slipped 0.7%. Oppenheimer downgraded the shares to Hold. Analyst Rupesh Parikh has a $300 price target for shares, very close to where the stock is trading today.", "description": "U.S. stock-index futures were marginally higher.", "authors": ["Al Root"], "top_image": "https://asset.barrons.com/public/resources/images/ON-CZ759_Mornin_OR_20190506093506.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
