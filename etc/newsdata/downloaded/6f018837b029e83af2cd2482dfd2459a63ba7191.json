Instead of leaning over and vocally asking your girlfriend or boyfriend, the LoveSync button does it for you. Essentially, there are two buttons \u2014 one for you, and one for your partner. If you\u2019re feeling horny, you tap your button to store your desire for a set period of time. If your partner also taps their button during the time period then both buttons will glow to signify a match.\n\nThe button may seem like a seamless way to start a heavy night of passion, especially if you don\u2019t want to talk to your partner beforehand for whatever reason, but there are a couple of problems with the button\u2019s existence.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re feeling like you could be gettin\u2019 down for some action, you anonymously tap your button,\u201d the page reads. \u201cYour desire will be stored for a set time period. No risk of rejection here, and no pressure on your partner \u2014 if only one of you tap, nothing happens.\u201d\n\nAccording to LoveSync, seemingly the new frontrunner for sex therapists of the year, here are the conditions in which it is okay to have sex with your partner:\n\nIf you push a button and they push a button\n\nIf you push a button and they do not cancel their request for sex\n\nIf your partner is actually the one to hit the button and not the cat or a book falling off a shelf or something.\n\nUh... that\u2019s it.\n\nThese set of buttons seem like they\u2019re designed for a traditional monogamous couple, so it\u2019s not exactly anonymous. Either you or your partner are horny; it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a third person in this equation. But it does bring up a particular quandary; as anyone with an Amazon Dash button and a cat, dog, or toddler will tell you, accidents happen. Sometimes, a button gets pressed over and over again, and you wind up with 10 cases of toilet paper because your cat got bored and started using the button as a toy. The same thing could happen with this button. Having a cat hit a button repeatedly, without your partner knowing, could send an awkward message about you being horny at 2:30 in the afternoon.\n\nLoveSync\u2019s Kickstarter campaign page states that \u201cIt provides the most benefit for couples who tend to not be as frequently outward about their sexual desires, but even those with above average drive have room to improve.\u201d This may be a good starting point for people who aren\u2019t comfortable or able to pick up on nonverbal cues, but it should only be the first step \u2014 everything should lead back to communication.\n\nAn FAQ section for the campaign goes into additional details about the product, including noting that although \u201cLoveSync will significantly reduce the number of failed foreplay attempts targeted at trying to find out if your partner is \u2018in the mood,\u2019 foreplay itself is an important psychological and physiological aspect of healthy sex.\u201d The FAQ section, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t include advice about simply talking to your partner about why there are so many failed foreplay attempts between the both of you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re also settling for suboptimal sex.\u201d\n\nThis is the main issue with LoveSync\u2019s strategy: it might be an easier way to let your partner known that you want to have sex, but doesn\u2019t fix the fundamental issue at hand. Talking about sexual relationships, and what your partner wants or needs to have a fulfilling sexual experience, is key to having a fulfilling sex life. It\u2019s not just about having more sex, as LoveSync\u2019s Kickstarter page boasts, it\u2019s about having better sex. Kate McCombs, a sex educator, told HealthLine this in 2017.\n\n\u201cWhen you avoid those vital conversations, you might avoid some awkwardness, but you\u2019re also settling for suboptimal sex,\u201d she said.\n\nLoveSync turns sex in an intimate relationship into a quantifiable activity, instead of one that should be centered around the quality of a couple\u2019s sex life. Healthy sexual relationships are borne out of healthy and openly communicative partners. Simply tapping a button and hoping your partner will tap back, like some kind of morse code in a dark room, doesn\u2019t fix the problem, it temporarily puts it on hold.\n\nAnd if your partner chooses to hold their button down for four seconds and \u201ccancel your desire,\u201d you\u2019ll be left thinking about what\u2019s going on inside their head instead of simply having a conversation.\n\nSeriously, just talk to your partner the next time you want to have sex and are unsure if they\u2019re up to it \u2014 and save yourself $50 in the process.\n\nCorrection: The article has been updated to clarify how the buttons work. Pressing a button does not send \u201ca signal to your partner\u2019s button, basically asking if they\u2019d also like to have sex\u201d as previously stated.", "description": "A Kickstarter campaign for a set of buttons \u2014 designed for couples to use when they want to have sex \u2014 isn\u2019t a great solution for sexual relationship issues.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Feb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g-Ofvi-BZNYUHUpYgtxR6PMshRo=/0x0:1257x658/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13752744/Screen_Shot_2019_02_11_at_4.54.52_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-02-11"}
