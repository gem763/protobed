PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - Charlie Morton hopes to start the Tampa Bay Rays\u2019 comeback in the AL Division Series against the Astros, two years after pitching Houston to its first championship.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve leaned on him so heavily, and he\u2019s kind of risen to every challenge, every task we ask,\u201d manager Kevin Cash said Sunday.\n\nAfter getting Verlandered and Coled by the Astros\u2019 aces, the wild-card Rays trail 2-0 in the best-of-five series, which resumes Monday at Tropicana Field. Summer acquisition Zack Greinke starts for Houston, trying to reach its third straight AL Championship Series.\n\nMorton won Game 7 of the 2017 AL Championship against the New York Yankees, starting with five scoreless innings, then won Game 7 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers by allowing one run over the last four innings. He beat Oakland in last week\u2019s AL wild-card matchup to improve to 3-0 with a 0.64 ERA in winner-take-all games.\n\nHe faced his former team twice during the regular season, winning at home 4-2 on March 29 and losing 15-1 at Houston on Aug. 27.\n\n\u201cYou play team like the Astros the Yankees, the Red Sox, the Dodgers, and there\u2019s a mystique and about them. You know that those teams are really good,\u201d Morton said.\n\n\u201cFor me, there\u2019s really no mystery with the Astros. It\u2019s just kind of they are who they are to me. I mean, I know those guys pretty well, on and off the field,\u201d Morton said. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of the challenges they present. I know what they\u2019re made of. I\u2019m just going to go out there \u2026 and try to make pitches and challenge them.\u201d\n\nAstros manager A.J. Hinch played down the significance of facing one of his former pitchers in such an important game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through that. I don\u2019t think it changes a ton other than the stage is a little bigger,\u201d Hinch said.\n\n\u201cI mean, obviously, we will always remember him fondly and with good memories. He\u2019s done a lot in this organization,\u201d the manager added. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re at the time of the year where we can get past that pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nMorton is 3-2 in eight career postseason appearances.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to ask another big one of him \u2026 and have all the confidence in the world he can go out there and give us an opportunity to quiet a really good offense,\u201d Cash added, \u201cand let our offense find a way to get going.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay struck out 23 times while scoring one run with five hits over 14 2/3 innings against Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole in the first two games. The Rays are hitting .177 with two extra-base hits overall.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen the last two games against Houston, they had it on their side with Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole. They\u2019ve kind of been there, done that - both of them,\u201d Cash said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got a guy that the irony is that he was a part of that group, but he\u2019s doing it in a Rays uniform now. So that helps.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay is in the playoffs for the first time since 2013, when the Rays made the last of four postseason appearances within a six-season span under former manager Joe Maddon.\n\nCenterfielder Kevin Kiermaier is the only player remaining on the roster from that team, however Cash said there\u2019s enough experience in the clubhouse that the young Rays understand that the team\u2019s singular focus right now has to be Game 3 - not what it will take to rally and win the series.\n\nGreinke, the 2009 AL Cy Young Award winner, is 8-1 with 3.02 ERA in 10 starts since being acquired by the Astros at the trade deadline. In his last regular start, the right-hander came within two out of throwing a no-hitter against the Seattle Mariners.\n\nCash said facing Greinke will be different, though not any easier, than going against Verlander and Cole.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just as good as them, he just gets there in a different way,\u201d the Rays manager said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the power, but what he lacks with the power with the fastball, her certainly can mix pitches with the best of them. Very, very unpredictable.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Astros believe their experience in playing potential elimination games will be beneficial with the series shifting to Tropicana Field.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I take the most pride in is our ability to stay in the moment and just play today\u2019s game,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not celebrating until we get three wins in this series. We\u2019re not going to take it for granted. We know across the way those guys are really good and they know how to win. This is a tough place to play.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Charlie Morton hopes to start the Tampa Bay Rays' comeback in the AL Division Series against the Astros, two years after pitching Houston to its first championship.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Fred Goodall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/alds_astros_rays_baseball_18259_c0-170-5396-3316_s1770x1032.jpg?65f5cd1e2794826dbc844264cad627dbafbb6224", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
