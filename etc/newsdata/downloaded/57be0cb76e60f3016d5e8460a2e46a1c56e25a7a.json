Very soon the couple would also have two healthy baby girls of their own whom they named Anita and Maryna.\n\nBut when Chris and Jorina got divorced, Chris married Cathy.\n\nAnd in 2016 Cathy shot Chris.\n\n'Robbery'\n\nFor Anita Brits (28) this nasty chapter of her and her sister\u2019s lives finally ended when Cathy (32) was sent to prison for 20 years on Tuesday for murdering their father. He was shot in the head on April 11, 2016. Cathy alleged there\u2019d been a robbery at the house.\n\nFor a long time, Anita says, she had no answers to her questions \u2013 until Cathy, who\u2019s in the meantime become pregnant with her second child, finally spilt the beans and admitted her guilt.\n\n\u201cShe admitted she\u2019d killed him because she was involved in an extramarital affair,\u201d Anita told YOU on Wednesday\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy that it\u2019s over now because the trial opened up all the old wounds again. I was feeling sorry for her child; she\u2019s messed up the life of another child.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t feel sorry for her. Even if she\u2019d been given the death sentence, it wouldn\u2019t bring back my father.\u201d\n\nAnita says she and her sister, Maryna Roets (27), were in court when Cathy was sentenced.\n\nPremeditated murder\n\nMaryna says Cathy, who stood trial on charges including the premeditated murder of Chris and the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, was sentenced to a total of 45 years, but will serve just 20 of those.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to feel; it\u2019s still a jumble of emotions.\u201d\n\nYOU reported earlier that Cathy was 18 years old when Chris and Jorina separated. When Cathy was 20 she fell pregnant and moved into the house with Chris, who was concerned about her.\n\nHowever, their relationship took a romantic turn and Cathy\u2019s child was barely a year old when Chris married her.\n\nThen, in 2016, she shot and killed him, pretending it was a robbery and even involving Jorina (now 58) in the crime.\n\nLips are sealed\n\nJorina had been behind bars for just more than a year for obstruction of justice when she was released and placed under house arrest. In terms of her parole conditions she\u2019s not allowed to talk to the media.\n\nBut Maryna says her mom testified in court that she\u2019d helped Cathy to make the murder scene look like a robbery because she was afraid Cathy would kill her too.\n\nThe two sisters say they\u2019ve forgiven their mom for her part in the crime and accept that she became involved in the mess because of Cathy..\n\n\u201cCathy never looked sorry to me in court,\u201d Anita says when asked whether Cathy has any remorse about the murder. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t believe she was capable of doing a thing like this.\u201d\n\nAnita says her life has been hell for the past three years. Not only did she have to come to terms with the death of her father, but in the meantime her husband, Armand, who was a key witness in the case, was killed in a car accident. She and Armand were the first people on the scene of her dad\u2019s murder.\n\nChris was sitting on his couch watching television when he was shot in the head.\n\nJorina, who was visiting Cathy at the time, apparently was instructed afterwards to throw out the contents of all the cupboards to make it look as if the house had been robbed.\n\n\"One day I'll probably be able to forgive Cathy, because that's what the Bible commands, but forget? Never. I'll never talk to her again; I'll never visit her in jail,\" Anita says.", "description": "Three years after a Brakpan woman shot and killed her husband, who was also her adoptive dad, in their home, she\u2019s been jailed for an effective 20 years by the High Court in Pretoria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8853/0b9b6fc2356547719f05e053d5f36e7b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-12"}
