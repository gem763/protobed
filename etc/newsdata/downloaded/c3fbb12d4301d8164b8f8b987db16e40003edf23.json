Add Interest\n\nShe made headlines for her romance with Kaitlynn Carter and new connection with singer Cody Simpson. Now, she's got a message for everyone: Back off and let her have some fun.\n\nIn a lengthy Instagram story message and Twitter post, Cyrus acknowledged that people feel \"invested\" in her relationships because they've watched her grow up, but now that she's an adult, she wants to be able to make choices without any judgment.\n\n\"Men...are RARELY slut shamed,\" she said. \"They move on from one beautiful young woman to the next MOST times without consequence. They are usually referenced as 'legends,' 'heartthrobs,' 'G,' 'Ladies' Man' etc...where women are called s----/w-----! I am trying just to THRIVE/survive in a 'man's' world...if we can't beat 'em, join 'em.\"\n\nShe added, \"Can't I just have a kiss and an acai bowl?!?!\"\n\nThat's a reference to a photo Cyrus put on her Instagram story of herself sitting on Simpson's lap. It's captioned, \"Can a girl not get a f------- acai bowl and a morning make out session in peace?!?\"\n\nCyrus went on to say, \"This 'dating' thing is new to me too. I've never been an 'adult' ... woman experiencing this ... I was in a committed relationship for almost all my teens and early 20s ... and 'meeting/trusting' people in my position is really tuff.\"\n\nShe then made a request.\n\n\"I have a great life I wouldn't trade for 'privacy,' but PLEASE don't make this awkward for me! ... Get used to me dating -- this is where I am at!\" she wrote, ending with the hashtag \"HotGirlFall.\"", "description": "Miley Cyrus has a message for everyone: Back off and let her have some fun.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/miley-cyrus-gty-ps-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
