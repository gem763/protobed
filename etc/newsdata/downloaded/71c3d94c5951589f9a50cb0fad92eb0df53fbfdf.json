During the Six Nations his preferred midfield trio was Owen Farrell at fly-half with Manu Tuilagi and Slade outside him. Slade\u2019s knee injury has been untimely but Jones has now settled on George Ford, Farrell, who resumes the captaincy, and Tuilagi as his preferred midfield. This is the third time they start together as a trio, having done so to impressive effect against Ireland in the warm-up series and Tonga previously.\n\nUp front, Joe Marler starts at loosehead with Mako Vunipola set to make his second comeback from the hamstring injury he suffered in May\u2019s Champions Cup final from the replacements bench. His first was against Ireland in August but he lasted just a few minutes before hobbling off again. Nowell meanwhile, has not played at all since suffering a knee injury in the Premiership final but before England flew to Japan, Jones had this match in mind for both he and Vunipola to make their comebacks and like Slade both are set for their first taste of action in Japan.\n\nLawes can consider himself unfortunate to miss out the XV but falls victim to the depth England have at lock and the form with which Maro Itoje and Kruis are playing, not to mention their Saracens connection with the hooker Jamie George. Completing the tight five is Kyle Sinckler while again the back-row consists of Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Billy Vunipola. Lewis Ludlam is rewarded for a fine showing against the USA with a place on the bench, meaning there is no Mark Wilson in the matchday 23. Like Slade, Wilson established himself as a key figure during the Six Nations but he too has been hampered by an untimely knee injury.\n\nIn the backs Ben Youngs wins his 92nd cap at scrum-half to become England\u2019s third most capped player and he will be joined by Dan Cole as and when his Leicester team-mate comes off the bench. Jonny May and Anthony Watson take their place on the wings while Elliot Daly continues at fullback as one of five players along with Marler, Curry, Billy Vunipola and Ford to start all three of England\u2019s matches.\n\nLuke Cowan-Dickie is providing cover at hooker on the bench, Willi Heinz at scrum-half, but with Slade and Nowell both returning to the 23, there is no place for Jonathan Joseph despite impressive showings in both matches so far. Jones said: \u201cWe are in Tokyo for the first time and the players are excited to be here and have had a good week\u2019s preparation so far. We know Argentina are a very good team and our players will be ready for the game.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Lobbe cautious of flattery from \u2018very, very clever\u2019 Eddie Jones Read more\n\n\u201cArgentina is a completely different team from others we have played so far in the pool stages and are always about the physical contest. This week it\u2019s about getting our game right, our set piece in a good place and making sure defensively we are organised and ready to find ways to score points against them.\u201d\n\nEngland: Elliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell (captain), Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Joe Marler, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje, George Kruis, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola.
