And there are also things you see around you in your world every single day, and you wonder to yourself, 'Why is that happening?'\n\nHost Paul Haavardsrud explains what CBC Radio's new national show and podcast is about. 1:04\n\nWell, the point of our show is to connect the dots between those things.\n\nWe'll start with that economic or monetary or financial force \u2014 really, anything that touches money at all, and money pretty much touches everything \u2014 and connect that back down to your life.\n\nWhat can people expect when they listen to the show?\n\nWe look at the world through the lens of money, that's our story driver.\n\nA lot of people, in my experience, have this sort of vague sense that business is important, but they also think that there's a barrier to accessing that kind of information.\n\nAnd what we want to do is remove that barrier \u2014 making some of these ideas accessible to people by, week after week, showing people that there isn't that barrier between the business section and the rest of the newspaper.\n\nIt's all just stories and those stories affect our lives.\n\nHow did the idea for the show come about?\n\nTracy [Johnson, the show's executive producer] and I have been talking to the afternoon audiences at CBC across the country for years. But we only had five, six minutes a day, to talk about different stories. And we kept wanting a chance to go deeper on those stories and broaden them out, to be able to tell larger stories and have the time to treat them with the complexity and nuance that they deserved.\n\nWe felt that both of us could do it in an accessible way and a conversational, casual way and entertaining way, even. And we thought, well, how can we do that? And then a show seemed like a natural outlet.\n\nIn your view, what's the missing piece in our financial literacy in Canada? Is there one thing people should know about that they don't?\n\nI think the missing piece \u2014 and I say this as someone who has worked for business sections of a number of different newspapers \u2014 is the, 'So what?' Why does this matter to me as a Canadian?\n\nIf you're writing a 12-inch newspaper column, sometimes you can forget to bring it home to people. Either you get into jargon, or you're writing for a more specialized reader, and that's the missing piece \u2014 the accessibility piece. And accessibility always comes back to asking that question, 'So what?'\n\nMaybe you don't answer it very well. But if you at least ask it every single time, then more often than not, you're going to get something that does hit people where they live.\n\nWhat are some of the topics listeners can expect to hear about on the Cost of Living this upcoming season?\n\nOur first show is going to look at the trade war \u2014 China, the U.S., Canada, all the uncertainty there. We have a feature on the Toronto International Film Festival, which I think might surprise some people. We have a story coming up on Maggi sauce. We have pieces coming up on lobbying, vaping, billboards, the carbon tax.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "Produced out of Calgary, CBC Radio's new national show and podcast is deciphering the \"economics of everyday life.\"", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268687.1567526301!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/paul-haavardsrud-cost-of-living-host.jpg"}
