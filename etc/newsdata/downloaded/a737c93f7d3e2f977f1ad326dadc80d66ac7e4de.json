Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nOn Sunday\u2019s \u201cShark Tank,\u201d there was no winner winner, chicken dinner for two fried-chicken entrepreneurs. They turned down a dream of a lifetime.\n\nJonathan and Deborah Torres are the creators of Atlas Monroe, a product that may taste a lot like chicken but isn\u2019t. Made with wheat, it\u2019s a vegan twist on the fried chicken formula that left the sharks surprised.\n\n\u201cThis batter is extremely tasty,\u201d shark Lori Greiner said. \u201cIt\u2019s got some zip to it.\u201d\n\nAfter Deborah\u2019s father was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, the whole family decided to switch to a raw vegan diet. Ninety days later, they were in the kitchen trying to develop better-tasting food.\n\nJonathan and Deborah Torres, entrepreneurs from San Jose, California, with a plant-based version of fried chicken make a shocking decision on \"Shark Tank\" Oct. 6.

But their reluctance to share sales figures didn\u2019t win the two an ally in Shark Kevin O\u2019Leary: \u201cIt\u2019s never good when you don\u2019t give us the numbers, you know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have celebrities,\u201d Deborah said. \u201cWe have influencers vouching for us, telling the world it\u2019s the best they ever had without us ever paying anyone a dime. We were the first and only vegan company to be invited to the National Fried Chicken Festival.\u201d\n\nAccording to Deborah, their yearly sales were $63,000, net sales were $70,000, and gross sales were $76,000\n\nThe numbers confused the sharks.\n\n\u201cWait that doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d shark Mark Cuban said. \u201cYour numbers are backwards. You can\u2019t have $70,000 in sales and make $63,000.\u201d\n\nFor O\u2019Leary and fellow shark Barbara Corcoran, the confusion, along with a high valuation, was too much.\n\nViewing primer: 'Shark Tank': All your burning questions, answered\n\n'Shark Tank' secrets: Life-changing moments on an assembly line of product pitches\n\nMark Cuban, who says he went vegetarian three months ago, was ready to offer a deal on Sunday's \"Shark Tank.\" (Photo: Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY)\n\n\u201cAsking for $500,000 for 10% is ridiculous,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cYou\u2019re not that clear with your numbers. Just being honest with you. You\u2019re not worth $500,000. I\u2019d have to have 120% of the company.\u201d\n\nCorcoran thought they came on the show too early into their business: \u201cIf you were to come here and have orders or some proof. You have compliments and intent, but you don\u2019t have orders.\u201d\n\nThe Torreses insisted they did have orders, as well as a potential deal with a mega restaurant to push their product. That along with their margins was enough for Cuban to offer them a deal.\n\n\u201cI went vegetarian three months ago,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cThis is important to me. I love products I can eat.\u201d\n\nCuban initially offered them $500,000 as a line of credit for 30% of business, but he then decided to partner with guest shark Rohan Oza. Their offer was $1 million for the entire company with a 10% royalty for the Torreses. They would do all the heavy lifting and put up any financing Atlas Monroe needed.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing moment in 'Shark Tank' history,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cYou came in with a very confusing pitch. Now you have a million-dollar offer by two behemoths who can execute.\u201d\n\nBut the Torreses weren\u2019t willing to give up their company. They turned down the deal, leaving O\u2019Leary scratching his head.\n\n\u201cThe fact you guys are even offering a million dollars let\u2019s me know you do understand what we are worth,\u201d Deborah said.\n\nAs they walked away empty-handed, Jonathan promised viewers would see them on \u201cShark Tank\u201d again one day: \u201cWe're probably going to be there sitting next to them soon.\u201d\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/07/shark-tank-vegan-fried-chicken-entrepreneurs-wouldnt-bite-offer/3893466002/", "description": "On Sunday\u2019s \u201cShark Tank,\u201d there was no winner winner, chicken dinner.
