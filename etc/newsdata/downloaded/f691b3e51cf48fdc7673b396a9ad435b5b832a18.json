But are these masks and tools efficacious, and, more importantly, safe in untrained hands?\n\nWe earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article\n\nResearch has proven LED treatments to effectively treat a multitude of skin concerns, but the results are cumulative, meaning you won\u2019t see long-term benefits from that single salon trip you treat yourself to once a year. If regular appointments aren\u2019t an option, an at-home device could be the answer.\n\n\u201cAt-home LED devices are an excellent way to bring a normally in-office treatment to the comfort of your home,\" says Dr. Maryam Zamani, oculoplastic surgeon and founder of MZ Skin. \u201cThese at-home devices will not be as strong as the LED used in a clinic setting, but they do have similar benefits. Whereas professional treatments can last 10-20 minutes, at-home treatments are typically slightly longer.\"\n\nWhat is light therapy?\n\n\u201cLight therapy, or LED treatments have been around for over 30 years and were originally developed for astronauts to help with tissue healing and repair,\u201d explains Dr. Zamani.\n\nAccording to dermatologist Dr. Dennis Gross, the benefits of LED light therapy are manifold. They include treating acne, regulating natural oil production, stimulating collagen and elastin and minimising redness and wrinkles. Certain wavelengths have even been shown to reduce dark spots and uneven skin tone.\n\nAs the spectrum of light used does not include UV, there's no risk of damage \u2013 and you won't get a tan.\n\nHow does light therapy work?\n\n\u201cLED therapy uses light in the visible spectrum \u2013 including blue, yellow, amber and red \u2013 as well as light beyond the visible spectrum to penetrate different depths of skin. As the light wavelength increases, so does the depth of penetration,\u201d explains Dr. Gross. This light is absorbed by receptors in the skin, just like topical skincare, and each colour of light stimulates a different response in the skin. LED is suitable for use on all skin types and tones.\n\nAs Dr. Zamani adds that one of the primary benefits of LED therapy is the absence of downtime and discomfort \u2013 in fact, skin often looks positively glowing as soon as you slip out from behind the mask. What\u2019s more, the healing properties of LED also make it ideal for use after in-office procedures, such as peels, lasers and microneedling.\n\nHow to perform a LED treatment at home\n\nToday, there's a small but growing list of options when it comes to at-home light therapy devices. For a complete facial treatment, a mask is the most obvious investment, but the emergence of targeted 'wands' and smaller (more portable) treatment lights is especially interesting for treating areas of acne-prone skin.\n\nAs LED treatments deliver cumulative results, commitment is key. As Debbie Thomas, laser aesthetician and celebrity facialist says, \"just owning a device won\u2019t give you any results!\"\n\n\n\nWhile instructions will vary depending on the device you choose, LED treatments are usually light on labour. \"The good thing about LED masks is they are pretty simple to use and generally only need around 10 minutes of dedicated time,\" explains Thomas. While a mask offers more 'slip on and relax' appeal, \"wand devices are designed to be held over your skin for 20-30 mins, so it's normally a toss-up between an aching arm or boredom that leads a dedicated skin warrior to fall out of love with their new skin gadget.\"\n\nWhat colour LED do I need?\n\n\n\nRed: The majority of at-home LED masks offer a red light setting. At the lighter end of the spectrum, red light works to soothe inflammation and redness, while deeper shades penetrate the skin further to prompt cellular repair and circulation, resulting in a plumper, more vibrant complexion.\n\n\n\nBlue: This antibacterial light is used to kill the bacteria that leads to breakouts, making it ideal for treating acne-prone skin. Blue light also helps purify the skin and regulate oil glands.\n\nAmber: Less common in at-home devices, this shade works to revitalise the skin, reducing any swelling and increasing radiance.\n\nInfrared: Invisible to the naked eye, this light penetrates deeper than any other colour in the spectrum. It combats the signs of ageing by replenishing dermal and epidermal cells, stimulates the natural production of collagen and elastin, and speeds up the recovery process.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A professional-grade facial at home", "authors": ["Roberta Schroeder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RgDVeaUhB5G0Xp4Q_7I4Kw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/11b7060e407cfd4a15b93ad7307caee7", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
