An actress completely naked is meant to represent her and pushes the obscenity to a change of sex during the performance.\u201d\n\nLa Monnaie director Peter de Caluwe has been unimpressed by the criticism and said that the show will go ahead as planned. He defended Castelluci\u2019s artistic choices and said in a statement this week he was \u201cstupefied\u201d by the association\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cAs soon as all symbolism has been removed, a naked woman stands on stage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a revolutionary representation of Joan of Arc. Immediately after she was put to death, paintings and statues represented her half-naked.\u201d\n\nCo-produced with the Lyon opera house, \u201cJoan of Arc at the Stake\u201d was premiered in the French city two years ago, triggering protests from far-right militants who clashed with police before the last performance.\n\n\u201cLa Monnaie is particularly committed to freedom of expression,\u201d de Caluwe said. \u201cWe respect the opinions of others, but we ask them to show the same respect to us.\u201d", "description": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 A Christian association is trying to prevent Brussels opera house La Monnaie from staging a production of Arthur Honegger's oratorio", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
