Even our fantasies aren't safe from the virtue police\n\nAl-Khalili said that though we face huge challenges in the coming decades, we ultimately need science \u201cto save humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite all the problems and the issues facing humanity in the 21st century, now is still the best time to be alive because of the advances in medicine and technology our lives are easier, richer.\u201d\n\nAsked about the communication gap between researchers and the public, Al-Khalili said it would be hugely beneficial if more scientists stepped out of their labs and offices and engaged with the wider social sphere about their work and its potential applications. However, he also pointed out that it\u2019s not fair to expect someone who has dedicated many years to intricate, detailed research to be able to condense it all into a simple soundbite.\n\nAl-Khalili also discussed issues which have long fascinated science fiction writers and fans: teleportation and time travel. However, he says he\u2019s not convinced either is possible in practice \u2013 or at least not within his lifetime.\n\nWatch the full interview here:\n\nLike this story?
