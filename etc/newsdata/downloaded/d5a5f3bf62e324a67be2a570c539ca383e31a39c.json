The decision came just two days after acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyTrump says his Doral resort will no longer host G-7 after backlash CNN's Anderson Cooper mocks WH press secretary over Fox News interview Trump accuses media, Democrats of going 'crazy' over G-7 at his Miami resort MORE announced that the annual event would be held at the Miami-area resort next June.\n\nDespite arguing that Trump would not profit from the gathering, Mulvaney's announcement sparked widespread concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest for the president. Many asserted the move represented a violation of the Constitution's Emolument Clause, which bars federal officeholders from accepting payments from foreign countries, U.S. states or the federal government.\n\nTrump dismissed those concerns in a series of tweets late Saturday night, saying he was willing to hold the G-7 at \"no profit, or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA.\" But he acknowledged that he would no longer consider holding the event at the Trump National Doral because of the concerns.\n\n\"The Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\" Trump tweeted. \"Therefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020.\"\n\nWarren was among several Democratic lawmakers to call the Trump administration's initial move an example of \"corruption.\" She and other members of Congress have continually raised issues with the president's frequent use of his properties throughout his presidency.\n\nLast month, Warren released a policy plan addressing conflicts of interest in government, calling the Trump White House \u201cmost corrupt administration of our lifetimes.\u201d", "description": "2020 presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro on Saturday dismissed the significance of President Trump reversing his decision to hold next year's Group of Seven (G-7) summit at one of his properties in Florida, saying that the p", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/biden_warren_buttigieg_10152019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
