Next is Sweden with 13, followed by Australia with 12 and the US with 11.\n\nThe prize, which is worth SEK 5m (\u00a3400,000), was founded by the Swedish government to honour the memory of Pippi Longstocking\u2019s creator. It goes to a children\u2019s author, illustrator, oral storyteller or reading promoter from anywhere in the world, whom a jury of experts deem to be \u201cworking in the spirit\u201d of Astrid Lindgren.\n\nThe writer and translator Daniel Hahn, one of the UK\u2019s nominees, said the strong showing from British authors reflects the vigour in children\u2019s books publishing in the UK. \u201cWe produce a lot of good work,\u201d he said, \u201cbut also, significantly, we export a lot of it.\u201d\n\nThe fact that there are almost twice as many contenders from the UK as there are from the US may be to do with the way the nominations are sourced, he added, but the prize puts British writers and illustrators \u201cin an international context\u201d.\n\n\u201cYes, there might be 20 of us,\u201d Hahn said, \u201cbut there are also over 200 people on this list from other countries, most of whom are usually comprehensively ignored over here.\u201d Creators such as Allan Ahlberg, David Almond, Quentin Blake, and Shirley Hughes appear alongside writers of a similar stature from all over the world, he said. who are entirely unknown in the UK. \u201cI\u2019d challenge even a real children\u2019s books expert in the UK to recognise a quarter of the names on this list. It\u2019s a reminder of the extraordinary range of what\u2019s out there, but also, I\u2019m afraid, of our own extraordinary insularity.\u201d\n\nFormer winners include Philip Pullman, cited for writing that \u201cstands firmly on the side of young people, ruthlessly questioning authority and proclaiming humanism and the power of love whilst maintaining an optimistic belief in the child even in the darkest of situations\u201d, and US author Jacqueline Woodson, who the jury said \u201cintroduces us to resilient young people fighting to find a place where their lives can take root\u201d.\n\nCandidates are nominated by organisations from all over the world, with 2019\u2019s UK contenders also including Frances Hardinge, Theresa Breslin, Patrick Ness, Jan Pienkowski and Katherine Rundell.\n\nThe winner of the prize will be announced in March next year. This year\u2019s laureate, Belgian author Bart Moeyaert, said the award was \u201clike a huge hug\u201d; judges had praised his body of work for \u201cportray[ing] relationships at crisis point with a cinematic immediacy, even as his complex narratives suggest new ways forward\u201d.\n\n\u201cLiterature broadens your mind and opens frontiers,\u201d Moeyart said. \u201cLiterature gives you a language to express yourself and say what you mean. Literature can make you feel angry, and that\u2019s important, because it forces you to think.\u201d", "description": "The \u00a3400,000 Astrid Lindgren award rewards work \u2018in the spirit of\u2019 the Swedish author and this year\u2019s nominees range from Argentina to Zambia", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e7273a46ba4108dc3450d301953980de1de9f0/0_118_2966_1780/master/2966.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca6507da11c418c2f7d20539a56fbf93", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
