We have the rule of law.\u201d\n\nRafi was lured to the roof of the seminary, where her attackers pressed her to withdraw the complaint she had filed with the police. When she refused, she was tied up and set on fire.\n\nShe sustained burns to 80% of her body and died in hospital five days later on 10 April.\n\nHer death caused outrage and highlighted an alarming rise in sexual harassment cases.\n\nProtesters in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, demonstrated for several days, seeking \u201cexemplary punishment\u201d for the killers.\n\nSheikh Hasina, the prime minister, promised to prosecute all those involved.\n\nRafi had gone to police in late March to report sexual harassment, and a leaked video showed a police chief registering her complaint but dismissing it as \u201cnot a big deal\u201d.\n\nAt the time, police had said one of the 18 people initially arrested had accused the school\u2019s principal of ordering the attack.\n\nSupt Mohammad Iqbal, who led the police investigation, said the headteacher told them to put pressure on Rafi to withdraw the case and kill her if she refused.\n\nIqbal also said some of those arrested were Rafi\u2019s classmates and they had tied her up with a scarf before setting her on fire.\n\n\u201cThe plan was to pass the incident off as a suicide. But it fell through after Rafi managed to come downstairs while on fire because the scarf burnt and freed her hands and feet,\u201d he said.\n\nActivists said the murder exposed a culture of impunity around sexual crimes against women and children, and the risks of reporting harassment.\n\nProsecutions are also rare in cases of rape and sexual assault. After the killing, Bangladesh ordered 27,000 schools to set up committees to prevent sexual violence.\n\nDefence lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict. The case was fast-tracked, with the hearing taking 62 days.", "description": "Nusrat Jahan Rafi was set on fire after refusing to withdraw sexual harassment allegation", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eab0e502bb02dd2aaa6f8e7e8acb778e874a628/63_0_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a545ecd5071350ec3728767f8aa560c", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
