Bill Weld, who is challenging President Trump in the Republican primaries, proclaimed Monday that the president committed treason through his controversial phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- adding that the punishment for treason is death.\n\nThe statement drew a swift rebuke from the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cThe media\u2019s affliction with Trump Derangement Syndrome has driven them into an actual discussion of the proposed execution of the President of the United States,\u201d communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News. \u201cIn severe cases of TDS such as this, immediate consultation with a physician is recommended.\u201d\n\nLONG-SHOT GOP PRIMARY CHALLENGERS TO HAVE THEIR OWN DEBATE THIS MONTH -- MINUS TRUMP\n\nWeld was responding to claims that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden -- the son of former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden -- and threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine as leverage. Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cTalk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election, it couldn\u2019t be clearer. And that\u2019s not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason,\" Weld said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"It\u2019s treason pure and simple. And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death. That\u2019s the only penalty.\u201d\n\nWeld then referred to impeachment as a possible alternative to a criminal case, stating, \u201cThe penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.\u201d\n\nWeld\u2019s mention of the death penalty later ignited a conversation about the \u201clegal framework\u201d of the claim. Weld again said, \u201cThe only penalty for treason is death, it\u2019s spelled out in the statute.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. Code does list the death penalty as a punishment for treason, Weld\u2019s claim that it is the only penalty is false. Treason is covered by 18. U.S. Code \u00a7 2381, which says that a person guilty of treason \u201cshall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\u201d\n\nWhen Fox News asked Weld\u2019s campaign about this, they did not immediately respond.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWeld's comments came during a joint television appearance with the two other longshot Republicans challenging Trump in next year's primary: former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh. They have joined together to protest the canceling of GOP presidential primaries in some states in 2020.", "description": "Former Massachusetts Gov.\u00a0Bill Weld, who is challenging President Trump in the Republican primaries, proclaimed Monday that the president committed treason through his controversial phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky --\u00a0adding that the punishment for treason\u00a0is death.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/donald-trump-bill-weld-Reuters-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
