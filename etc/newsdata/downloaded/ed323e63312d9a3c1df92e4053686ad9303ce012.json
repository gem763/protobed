USA TODAY\n\nLeonard Williams has a new team, even though he'll be playing in the same state and the building he has called home for more than four years.\n\nAhead of the NFL's trade deadline on Tuesday, the Giants on Monday acquired Williams from the Jets for a pair of draft picks: a 2020 third-round pick and a 2021 fifth-round pick, a person with knowledge of the deal confirmed to NorthJersey.com and USA TODAY Network Northeast. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was not yet official.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter was the first to report the news.\n\nWilliams, a 2015 first-round selection for the Jets, had underwhelmed in his four-and-a-half seasons with the team, totaling 17 sacks over that span. While he had been a consistent presence on the field, starting all but one game in his time with the Jets, Williams suffered through spells of inconsistency and lacked production.\n\nAs the Jets transitioned to Gregg Williams as the team\u2019s defensive coordinator, Leonard Williams struggled to find his fit in the 4-3 scheme. This season, Williams has 20 total tackles but no sacks.\n\nIt\u2019s also a curious move for the Giants. Though the two teams play in the same market, they rarely work together. This is the first trade between the franchises in their respective histories, according to Pro Football Referen\n\nWilliams, 25, is playing in his fifth-year option in 2019 that pays him $14.2 million in base salary and is set to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. The Giants, therefore, will have an eight-game lease on Williams and can determine what to do with him after that.\n\nWilliams joins a crowded defensive line room that already has young players who are stepping up nicely in Dexter Lawrence, Dalvin Tomlinson, and B.J. Hill.", "description": "DE Leonard Williams was traded by the New York Jets, but he won't have to move far, as he lands with the New York Giants.", "authors": ["Art Stapleton", "Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
