Or should I reach out to my previous and current workplace pension providers? Do I also need to file a tax return?\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK YOUR PENSION QUESTION\n\nSteve Webb replies: It\u2019s great to hear from someone relatively young who is keen to get moving on pension saving!\n\nThe short answer is that I would be surprised if you need to worry too much about exceeding tax relief limits.\n\nAs you know, most people can put \u00a340,000 per year into a pension and receive tax relief on their contributions.\n\nSteve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below\n\nAs well as being allowed to put \u00a340,000 each year into a pension, you can make use of unused allowances from the three previous years \u2013 a process known as \u2018carry forward\u2019.\n\nAssuming that you have been contributing into \u2018pot of money\u2019 or \u2018defined contribution\u2019 pensions, what you need to look at is the total amount that you and your employer paid in to your pension in each of the last three financial years (16/17, 17/18 and 18/19).\n\nYou should be able to find this amount on your annual pension statements, or ask your pension provider for the figures if you cannot find them.\n\nIf the amount was below \u00a340,000 in any year, then the balance can be brought forward to the current year and added to the \u00a340,000 limit for this year.\n\nTo give an example, suppose you and your employer paid in \u00a310,000 in 16/17, \u00a320,000 in \u00a317/18 and \u00a330,000 in 18/19. This would leave you \u00a330,000 \u2018spare\u2019 allowance from 16/17, \u00a320,000 spare from 17/18 and \u00a310,000 spare from 18/19, a total of \u00a360,000.\n\nThis can be added to your \u00a340,000 for this year giving you a total limit of \u00a3100,000 in contributions for the current year. I should add that you can only go up to 100% of your total income (including bonuses) for this year, so if your income plus bonuses was, say, \u00a390,000, that would be your limit.\n\nIf you are putting this money into a personal pension, the pension provider will only claim basic rate tax relief on your behalf.\n\nSince you are a higher rate taxpayer, you would need to fill in a tax return to claim any higher rate relief to which you might be entitled.\n\nBut if there is any way of making these contributions through your workplace pension, it is possible that you might be able to pay the money in \u2018gross\u2019 and get all the tax relief immediately. The best thing to do would be to check with your workplace pension scheme to see if this is possible.\n\nOne important thing to note is that the \u00a340,000 limit (or the \u00a3100,000 limit in my example) includes employee contributions, employer contributions and any tax relief paid in to the pension. So the key figure is the actual gross amount received by the pension.\n\nFinally, although I can\u2019t give you personalised financial advice, I was surprised to see a young person talking about investing in cash 'for retirement'.\n\nAlthough investing in cash is very low risk, with inflation running at around 2 per cent and interest rates below this you are guaranteeing a real terms loss every year, potentially for decades to come.\n\nWhilst you are right that the stock market could go down, there are ways of investing across a range of assets which can reduce your overall risk without locking in to negative real returns for years to come.\n\nAlso, employees who use a Lifetime Isa to save for retirement - as opposed to just saving to buy a first home - over using their work scheme will miss out on employer contributions into their pension.\n\nThe above point won't apply to you, because you are maxing out your annual allowance through contributions to your workplace pension on top of saving into a Lifetime Isa.\n\nBut it is worth noting for the sake of other readers who may be choosing between using their work pension and a Lifetime Isa for retirement saving - the former gets you free money from an employer, while the latter does not.\n\nIn your case, given the amounts of money you are considering investing, it would be well worth having a session with a financial adviser to see if there is a better option.", "description": "I'd like to make the most of carrying forward my annual allowance for the last three years which has been substantially under-utilised.
