Taking the form of a poignant and funny memoir, the play recounts Schreck\u2019s participation in American Legion contests in which students tested their mastery of the U.S. Constitution. Over the course of 100 minutes, Schreck manages to vibrantly animate a document that some people may have consigned to the dry parchment archive of their memories.\n\nIn the spirit of civic-minded outreach that Schreck\u2019s play engenders \u2014 and certainly, as it reaches a city that uses the document as a kind of daily how-to manual \u2014 we asked some leading American figures in politics, media, the arts and the law about what the Constitution means to them.\n\nNancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), speaker of the House of Representatives\n\nIn their great wisdom, our Founders enshrined our most sacred freedoms in the First Amendment, which is the guardian of our democracy and of all the liberties that come after it. In the People\u2019s House, we are entrusted with the sacred responsibility to protect those liberties for the American people, and to advance a future that honors both the words of our Founders and the well-being of generations to come.\n\nBarbra Streisand, Oscar-winning actress, director, singer\n\nThe 14th Amendment of our Constitution actualized what many of the Founders wanted, promoting equal protection under the law for all Americans. If I could, I would end the antiquated electoral college. Twice in the last 20 years the popular vote winner was denied the presidency. This is an assault on our democratic principles, where the dictum should hold true: one person, one vote.\n\nLuis A. Miranda Jr., board chairman of the Latino Victory Fund and founding partner of the MirRam Group; father of Lin-Manuel Miranda\n\nFirst in our Bill of Rights \u2014 Congress shall make no law \u201cabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\u201d \u2014 because it is key to our future as a nation. It is no surprise that every time I hear [President Trump] say or see him tweet, \u2018The Fake and Corrupt Media is sooo bad for our Country, The Enemy of the People!,\u2019 I cringe. Our society relies on an honest and dependable press. And sometimes a negative press review can close a Broadway show or derail a promising political career. But it also can move a country like Puerto Rico to get rid of corruption or portray pain so vividly that millions are moved to show generosity, as they did in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Our Founders got it right.\n\nLaurence Tribe, professor at Harvard Law School\n\nTo me, the Constitution is more verb than noun. Less a bequest from a few inspired but flawed white men than a challenge to build \u201ca more perfect Union,\u201d a fairer and more equal nation, from their hopes and ideals \u2014 and from the dreams of those who marched and fought and died to make those ideals real.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), three-term member of Congress\n\nIn Congress, I am proud to represent New York\u2019s 21st District, home of the battles of Saratoga, Fort Ticonderoga and Fort William Henry, one of the geographic cradles of the American Revolution. My husband and I live in Schuylerville, named after the Schuyler family, who were so brilliantly depicted in the musical masterpiece \u201cHamilton.\u201d Honoring our nation\u2019s founding history fought for and envisioned by the \u201cyoung, scrappy, and hungry\u2019\u201d is part of our daily lives. Given this fabric of history embedded in Upstate New York, my district truly cherishes our Constitution. Of particular personal meaning to me this year is the 19th Amendment, recognizing women\u2019s suffrage, which was passed by Congress 100 years ago. Perhaps lesser known than the Revolutionary-era characters depicted in \u201cHamilton,\u201d suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton, author of the Declaration of Sentiments presented at the Seneca Falls Convention, hails from my district and was born in Johnstown, N.Y. Her extraordinary advocacy for women\u2019s suffrage leading to the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution is one of the cornerstones of history that empowers me to serve in the hallowed halls of Congress today.\n\nDeborah F. Rutter, president of the Kennedy Center\n\nI have a strong memory of a conversation with my father when I was a young person, sharing important family values. That conversation was about humanity and equity: \u201cPlease remember, all people are created equal, and everyone deserves equal opportunity,\u201d he told me. This, for me, is the foundation of my identity, my pursuits and beliefs \u2014 initially around my own personal opportunities and then, over time, how that impacts others and the communities I live in, as well as my chosen profession. My father instilled in me the belief that I, as a woman, deserved every opportunity, and ultimately this is true for all people, no matter their background, race or religion. The Constitution, to me, upholds those values, guides these principles and protects these freedoms. To draw a straight line, the Constitution is the foundation of my personal beliefs and the very essence of my identity as a woman, wife, mother, daughter, American.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund\n\nThere is no passage in the Constitution that has done more to shape our modern conception of what it means to be American than the 14th Amendment, one of the three amendments ratified after the end of the Civil War. It guarantees birthright citizenship, articulates the promise of equality, and fundamentally reorders the relationship between the federal government and the states, empowering Congress to pass laws to protect us against the prejudices of the states. Although these guarantees were focused on protecting African Americans (the vast majority of whom were newly freed slaves in 1868), they have come to embody the rights that all Americans regard as inalienable. Since the amendment\u2019s ratification, these guarantees have been the basis upon which the political, economic and social fabric of this country have been transformed many times over.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNicolle Wallace, author and anchor of MSNBC's 'Deadline: White House'; White House communications director under President George W. Bush\n\n\u201cThe President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States . . .\u201d\n\nAt this moment of extraordinary rancor, this is (or in my opinion should be) the most clarifying phrase of the Constitution. For all of our disagreements about the current occupant of the Oval Office, I worry that we forget that a president\u2019s most solemn duty is to the men and women who give their lives to protect everything we hold dear.\n\nWhen a president errs, his critics have a constitutionally protected right to criticize him at the top of their lungs. But when a president doesn\u2019t seem to understand history or the gravity of the office he occupies, we are in uncharted territory.\n\nWhat the Constitution Means to Me, by Heidi Schreck. $49-$169.
