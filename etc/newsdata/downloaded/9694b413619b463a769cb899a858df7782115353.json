The lure of 50 per cent off is heightened when the sale is opposite a departure gate, where the agony of missing out on the perfect pair of x, y or z is magnified by the inaccessibility of Heathrow Terminal 3 if I change my mind halfway home. (One of the three bags in Copenhagen materialised after a snap decision to buy a discounted Royal Copenhagen breakfast set and birch cedar-scented candles.)\n\nThe lure of an airport sale can make a mess of carry-on baggage systems. Bloomberg\n\nFanciful last-minute duty-free purchases over the years have included knee-high leather boots with matching handbag (JFK, New York); cushions and a throw from Shanghai Tang (Hong Kong); and multiple pairs of Tod\u2019s shoes (60 per cent off, Rome Fiumicino).\n\nI once bought an antique iron at a street market en route to the airport in Yangon, Myanmar. The Silk Air cabin crew deemed it a dangerous object and locked it in the galley, where it should have stayed, according to my fuming spouse.\n\nIt\u2019s as if the words \u201ccarry-on\u201d make me want to prove just how much I can shoulder.\n\nSomewhere over Europe, my husband decides something akin to an exorcism is required. We spend the flight home assessing the contents of my many handbags, which takes several time zones and turns up a mini-pharmacy, two jumpers, a raincoat, and a small library of magazines and books.\n\nDespite his withering glances, nothing appears superfluous to me, not even the cashmere beanie in case we transit via Minsk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn touchdown back in Sydney, he casts a final censorious look at my hand luggage, which has been augmented by an irresistible purchase or three in Dubai, including a large brass incense burner.\n\n\u201cNext time we\u2019re flying Ryan Air,\u201d he mutters, adding that you have to pay a fiver for more than one piece of carry-on with the discount carrier.\n\nAs if that would stop me.\n\nYour mind unpacked\n\nPsychologist Judith Fein explains what your packing style says about your personality.\n\nThe Minimalist: No-nonsense, organised person who needs to be in control of their life. Always tends to look good, but can have trouble expressing their feelings.\n\nThe Worrier: Packs a week before the trip, then throws more things in at the last minute. Worriers are usually \u201cno-frills\u201d, but tightly wound. You are smart, sensitive, and probably have been hurt.\n\nThe Last-Minute Packer (chaos style): Packing makes you anxious; postponing it makes you even more anxious. Once on the road, you realise you\u2019ve packed all wrong and only wear a fraction of it. You\u2019re charming and fun, but deep down, anxiety rules.\n\nThe Last-Minute Packer (organised style): You know how to plan and act. You have an illusion of control and are upset when things get out of hand. You sometimes have trouble in relationships because you\u2019re more head than heart. You are whimsical and often afraid of rejection.", "description": "Not everyone can swan around the globe with just a tiny backpack and a smug air.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5978%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/06980ed6ad6b3e33d2a103e7240f093ef4d47da8", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
