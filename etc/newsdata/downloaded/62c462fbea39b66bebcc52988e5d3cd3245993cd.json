In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., John Roman, a senior fellow with NORC at the University of Chicago, an independent social research institution, explained that the latest crime statistics reflect an encouraging continuation of a long-term trend.\n\n\u201cIf you are under the age of 40, you\u2019ve never been safer than you are today,\u201d Roman said.\n\nWhile the United States is safer than it has been for as far back as many Americans can remember, some cities are even safer, with violent crime rates less than half the current national rate. Using data from the FBI, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed violent crimes rates \u2013 a population-adjusted measure of incidents of rape, robbery, homicide, and aggravated assault \u2013 to identify America\u2019s safest cities. Only the 294 midsize and large cities tracked by the FBI with populations of at least 100,000 were considered.\n\nDangerous cities: The Midwest is home to many of the towns in the US with higher violent crime rates\n\nAffordable cities: This is where everyone wants to live right now\n\nThe cities with the lowest violent crime rates tend to share several other socioeconomic characteristics as well \u2013 notably, economic prosperity. \u201cThe more affluent a place is, the less crime there is on average,\u201d Roman said. Indeed, the vast majority of the cities on this list have a low unemployment rate and a high median household income \u2013 some even rank among the wealthiest places in the country. Here is a look at the top 25 richest cities in America.\n\nMany of these cities have capitalized on existing features \u2013 whether that means marketing a natural waterway or vista as a tourist destination \u2013 or industries built around a local university. \u201cSuccessful cities market their assets and build around their assets,\u201d Roman said.\n\nWith a healthy economy and safe streets, the population in the vast majority of cities on this list is growing rapidly. \u201cGrowing cities tend to grow because they\u2019re perceived as safe, and that safety compounds in a virtuous cycle,\u201d Roman said. \u201cSafe places get safer.\u201d Here is a look at America\u2019s 25 fastest growing cities.\n\nBoca Raton, Florida.

For reference, there were 369 violent crimes for every 100,000 people nationwide the same year. The city, located along the coast of southeastern Florida, has 46 parks, a well-regarded public school system, and a healthy job market. As is often the case in cities on this list, Boca Raton is a relatively affluent city. Most area households earn at least $76,000 a year \u2013 far more than the comparable median income nationwide of $57,652.\n\n49. College Station, Texas\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 203.3 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 1\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 31.8%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 2.9%\n\nCollege Station is a small city that is home to the main campus of Texas A&M University. Of the four classifications of violent crime \u2013 rape, robbery, homicide, and aggravated assault \u2013 rape is the only one with a higher than typical incidence rate in College Station. There were 65 reported rapes for every 100,000 people in the city, compared to about 43 per 100,000 nationwide.\n\nMeanwhile, the murder rate in College Station is less than 1 per 100,000, well below the national rate of 5 per 100,000.

Similarly, the city's murder rate is less than one-fifth the national murder rate of 5 per 100,000.\n\nMore often than not, safe cities are relatively affluent. In Clovis, the typical household earns $68,682 a year, about $11,000 more than the typical American household.\n\n47. Rochester, Minnesota\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 194.0 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 5\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 10.4%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 2.2%\n\nRochester is the safest city in Minnesota and one of the safest nationwide.

For reference, there were about 627 violent crimes for every 100,000 in St. Paul \u2013 the second safest city in the state.\n\nCrime rates tend to be lower in cities with better economic opportunities, and in Rochester, there are jobs available for nearly everyone who wants one. The city's annual unemployment rate is just 2.2%, well below the 3.9% national unemployment rate.\n\n46. Henderson, Nevada\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 188.3 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 15\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 9.1%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 4.4%\n\nHenderson is the only city in Nevada with a population of at least 100,000 with a violent crime rate below the national rate of 369 incidents per 100,000 people. By far the safest city in the state, Henderson has an annual violent crime rate of 188 incidents per 100,000 residents. The next safest city in Nevada is Sparks, with a violent crime rate of 496 incidents per 100,000 people.\n\nCities with low rates of violent crime tend to have better economic opportunities and smaller shares of the population that are struggling financially. Henderson is the only city reviewed in Nevada where fewer than one in every 10 residents live below the poverty line.\n\n45. Torrance, California\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 181.7 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 2\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 7.2%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 3.8%\n\nA small city of 147,000 located about 15 miles south of Los Angeles, Torrance is one of 14 cities in California to rank among the safest nationwide. There were only 182 violent crimes in Torrance for every 100,000 people in 2018, half the national violent crime rate of 369 incidents per 100,000 people.\n\nProperty crimes \u2013 another broad FBI classification that includes infractions like motor vehicle theft, burglary, and larceny \u2013 are also relatively rare in Torrance. There were just 1,838 property crimes reported for every 100,000 people in the city in 2018, well below the national rate of 2,200 per 100,000.\n\n44.

There was only one homicide in the southeastern Florida city in 2018, or 0.6 murders for every 100,000 people. Nationwide, the annual murder rate stands at 5 homicides per 100,000 people. Including other crimes like aggravated assault and robbery, the overall violent crime rate in the city is just 181 per 100,000 people, about half the national rate of 369 per 100,000.\n\nLike most other safe U.S. cities, the vast majority of those living in Pembroke Pines are financially secure. The city's 8.4% poverty rate is well below the comparable 14.6% national rate.\n\n43. Centennial, Colorado\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 180.9 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 2\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 4.3%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 2.8%\n\nThere were only 181 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in Centennial, Colorado, a small city just southeast of Denver. Non-violent crimes like motor vehicle theft and burglary are also not especially common in the city. There were 1,754 property crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018, well below the national property crime rate of 2,200 per 100,000.\n\nWealthier cities tend to be relatively safe, and Centennial is one of the wealthiest cities in the country. Over half of all households in the city have an income of over $100,000 a year, well above the median household income nationwide of $57,652.\n\n42. Sterling Heights, Michigan\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 180.4 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 2\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 12%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 3.8%\n\nThe eastern Michigan city of Sterling Heights is the only city in the state to rank among the safest in the country. There were only 180 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in the city in 2018 \u2013 a stark contrast to Detroit, located roughly 20 miles to the south, and its nation-leading violent crime rate of 2,008 incidents per 100,000 people.\n\nEconomic opportunities appear to be much more widely available in Sterling Heights than in Detroit. The 2018 unemployment rate in Sterling Heights was just 3.8%, while it was 9% in Detroit.\n\n41. Provo, Utah\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 175.4 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 2\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 25.4%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 2.7%\n\nHome to Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, is one of several college towns to rank among the safest cities in the country. There were only 175 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in the city in 2018, by far the lowest rate of any city with a population of at least 100,000 in Utah and well below the 369 per 100,000 national rate.\n\nRobbery, a component of violent crime, is especially uncommon in Provo. Just 22 robberies were reported in the city in 2018 \u2013 or 19 robberies for every 100,000 people, a fraction of the national robbery rate of 86 per 100,000.\n\nSimi Valley, California.

There were only 166 violent crimes reported for every 100,000 people in 2018, less than half the national violent crime rate of 369 per 100,000.\n\nLike in many of the safest cities, Scottsdale residents are relatively wealthy. The typical Scottsdale household earns $80,306 a year, far more than the national median household income of $57,652. Similarly, just 8.9% of residents live in poverty, compared to the 14.6% national poverty rate.\n\n38. Stamford, Connecticut\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 165.1 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 3\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 9.3%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 3.7%\n\nStamford, Connecticut, is the safest city of 100,000 or more residents in Connecticut and the broader New England region. There were 165 violent crimes reported for every 100,000 people in the city in 2018, well below the 369 per 100,000 national violent crime rate. Meanwhile, New Haven, located about 40 miles east of Stamford, is one of the most dangerous cities in the country, with a violent crime rate of 842 incidents per 100,000 people.\n\nAs is often the case in the safest American cities, Stamford is growing rapidly. In the last decade, the number of people living in the city climbed from 119,500 to 132,000, a 10.5% increase. Over the same period, the total U.S. population grew by 6.6%.\n\n37. Sunnyvale, California\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 163.8 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 1\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 6.6%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 2.2%\n\nSunnyvale is a city of about 156,000 in California's Silicon Valley area.

In Sunnyvale, most households have an income of over $118,000 a year, more than double the national median household income, and the annual unemployment is just 2.2%, well below the 3.9% national rate. Safe streets and a strong economy may explain the city's rapid population growth. Over the last decade, the number of people living in Sunnyvale spiked by 17.8%, well more than double the national population growth of 6.6% over the same period.\n\n36. Rancho Cucamonga, California\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 161.9 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 1\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 8.4%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 3.1%\n\nRancho Cucamonga's violent crime rate of 162 incidents per 100,000 is among the lowest of any mid- to large-sized American city. As is typical of safer American cities, joblessness and financial hardship are not common in Rancho Cucamonga. Just 3.1% of area workers were unemployed in 2018, and 8.4% of the population live below the poverty line \u2013 compared to the 3.9% national unemployment rate and the 14.6% national poverty rate.\n\nRancho Cucamonga is located just 20 miles east of San Bernardino, one of the most dangerous cities in the United States.

Wealthy areas tend to have lower crime rates on average, and in Santa Clara, there were just 162 violent crimes for every 100,000 people, well below the 369 per 100,000 national rate.\n\nWhile violent crimes are relatively rare in Santa Clara, property crimes like larceny and motor vehicle theft are not. There were 2,907 property crimes for every 100,000 people in the city in 2018, compared to a much lower national property crime rate of 2,200 per 100,000.\n\n34.

While there were 941 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents in Washington, D.C. in 2018 \u2013 more than twice the national violent crime rate \u2013 Alexandria is one of the safest cities in the country. There were just 160 violent crimes reported per 100,000 Alexandria residents in 2018, compared to the national rate of 369 incidents per 100,000 Americans.\n\nWhile the relationship between wealth and crime is complicated, wealthier areas tend to have lower crime rates. In Alexandria, the typical household earns $93,370 a year, about $36,000 more than the national median household income. Similarly, just 2.2% of the Alexandria labor force is unemployed, far less than the 3.9% national unemployment rate.\n\n33.

Adjusted for population, there were just 159 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents, the least of any midsize or large city in Idaho and less than half the national rate of 369 incidents per 100,000 Americans.\n\nThe low prevalence of crime may be a pull factor for the new residents moving to Meridian. From 2009 to 2018, the population of Meridian grew by 45%, nearly seven times the 6.6% national growth rate and among the highest growth rates of any city nationwide.\n\n32. Coral Springs, Florida\n\n\u2022 2018 violent crime rate: 155.2 per 100,000 people\n\n\u2022 2018 homicides: 1\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate: 10%\n\n\u2022 2018 unemployment rate: 3.3%\n\nCoral Springs is a city of approximately 135,000 residents in Broward County located about 50 miles north of Miami.

Crime is disproportionately concentrated in low-income areas and Coral Springs is one of the wealthier midsize cities in both Florida and the U.S. as a whole. The typical Coral Springs household earns $70,768 a year, far more than the national median household income of $57,652.\n\n31.
