Worse, it's boring. (Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)\n\n[Complete college football scoreboard and schedule for Week 3]\n\nThe optimism hadn\u2019t faded at UCLA at this time a year ago. Not quite, anyway. The Bruins had just gotten trounced 49-21 at Oklahoma, right in line with expectations for the pairing of a perennial playoff contender against a program starting over.\n\nStill, Coach Chip Kelly was supposed to invigorate the Bruins, just as he had Oregon a decade ago. An encore in the college game was possible after his sabbatical in the NFL. Surely, by the time Oklahoma made the return trip to the Rose Bowl in a mere 53 weeks, Kelly would have worked his magic and achieved a degree of relevance.\n\nInstead, UCLA is 3-11 under Kelly. The Bruins are worse than irrelevant, more so than losses to Cincinnati and San Diego State to open this season suggest. They fall short of a more stringent standard than wins and losses. They are boring, No. 126 nationally in total offense (239.5 yards per game) and tied for 119th in scoring offense with a pair of 14-point outings.\n\nOh, and Oklahoma is still Oklahoma, facing UCLA again Saturday night in Pasadena as a three-possession favorite. It would leave UCLA with consecutive 0-3 starts for the first time since 1919-21 \u2014 the program\u2019s first three years of existence.\n\n[Today's college football viewing guide]\n\nThis was not what UCLA thought it was getting for its five-year, $23.3 million investment in Kelly. While patience is an underutilized virtue, the results are so far out of line with Kelly\u2019s reputation at the college level that it\u2019s already fair to wonder if he can turn things around.\n\nThere was reason for the Bruins to be hopeful about their future at this time last year. Now? Saturday\u2019s announced crowd of 36,951 (or roughly 55,000 shy of capacity) wasn\u2019t exactly a vote of confidence from UCLA fans.\n\nGrad transfer of the week\n\nThe graduate transfer rule is a worthy form of college football free agency, and it has altered how rapidly a program can reverse its fortunes. Take one look at former Virginia Tech quarterback Josh Jackson\u2019s impact at Maryland for the latest bit of evidence.\n\n[2-0 Maryland was throttled by Temple last year, but the Terps say everything\u2019s changed]\n\nIn Kentucky\u2019s case, the offseason arrival of former Troy quarterback Sawyer Smith provided valuable insurance in case something happened to junior Terry Wilson, who last year led the Wildcats to their first 10-win season since 1977.\n\nWell, something did happen to Wilson, who suffered a season-ending knee injury Saturday against Eastern Michigan. In steps Smith, who has some experience in these matters. He took over at Troy when Kaleb Barker was lost midway through last season with a knee injury, led the Trojans to a 5-2 mark and was the MVP of the Dollar General Bowl.\n\nKentucky (2-0) should have a decent idea whether Smith can provide an encore by month\u2019s end. Florida comes to Lexington on Saturday, with trips to Mississippi State and South Carolina the following two weeks. Nonetheless, Smith\u2019s experience and suddenly expanded role is a reminder the value of a graduate transfer doesn\u2019t have to materialize in time for the start of season.\n\nFive with the most at stake in Week 3\n\n1. Florida State. The Seminoles followed their flop of a second half against Boise State with a one-point escape against Louisiana-Monroe. A miserable showing at Virginia would be the third piece of evidence a turnaround isn\u2019t coming in Year Two for Willie Taggart.\n\n[Virginia is surging, FSU is reeling entering ACC matchup turned upside-down]\n\n2 and 2a. Arizona State and Michigan State. A pair of Power Five unbeatens meet on the back end of a home-and-home. The Sun Devils won, 16-13, last year at home in what at the time was hailed as a pivotal start to the Herm Edwards era. The jury\u2019s still out; Arizona State is 7-6 since then. Meanwhile, it\u2019s the toughest test yet in 2019 for the Spartans, who handled Tulsa and Western Michigan with little trouble the last two weeks.\n\n3. Central Florida. The Knights are 27-1 since the start of the 2017 season, with the lone loss in last year\u2019s Fiesta Bowl to LSU. Stanford, which gets quarterback K.J. Costello back from a head injury, may be as well-equipped as anyone on UCF\u2019s schedule to deal it a regular season loss.\n\n[UCF football and its fans are \u2018still fighting the fight against the Power Five\u2019]\n\n4 and 4a. Iowa and Iowa State. In addition to determining who claims the Cy-Hawk Trophy for the next 12 months, this is also a pairing of teams expected to finish in the top half of their respective leagues. Iowa (2-0) has already dusted off Miami (Ohio) and Rutgers by a combined 68-14 margin, while Iowa State has had two weeks to get ready after surviving a triple-overtime scare against Northern Iowa.\n\n5 and 5a and 5b. Miami, South Florida and Tennessee. All three are 0-2, and all three get FCS teams they would be wise to pulverize on Saturday simply to stem their early-season criticism (especially Tennessee). Miami plays host to Bethune-Cookman, South Florida welcomes South Carolina State and Tennessee meets Chattanooga in what all three hope are get-well-now games.\n\nRead more:\n\nAlabama is penalizing students for leaving football games early.
