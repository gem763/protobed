Graham said in a statement Monday that a vote on the rules regarding the impeachment inquiry \u201cis a bit like un-ringing a bill as House Democrats have selectively leaked information in order to damage President Trump for weeks.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina senator credited his and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-KY) resolution, which reportedly has the support of 50 Republican senators, except for Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Mitt Romney (R-UT), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming response House Democrats heard from the American people and Senate Republicans in support of my resolution forced their hand,\u201d Graham contended. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an acknowledgment of the success of our efforts last week.\u201d\n\nGraham said:\n\nThe American people have been outraged by the unfair nature, and lack of due process House Democrats have given to President Trump. I take pride in the fact that our vigorous response to their underhanded tactics ended up making the House Democrat position untenable. Today, they were forced to change course.\n\n\u201cFinally, I look forward to reviewing their proposal and ensuring it provides President Trump with the rights and privileges Republicans afforded former President Clinton during the 1998 impeachment process,\u201d he said.", "description": "Lindsey Graham said Monday that Republicans \"forced\" the Democrats' hand, making them vote on the rules regarding an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Lindsey-Graham-Resolution-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
