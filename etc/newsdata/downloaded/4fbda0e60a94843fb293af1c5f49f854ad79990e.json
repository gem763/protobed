Here's How He First Came to Power", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s not hard to see why Robert Mugabe, whose death was announced Friday, would have wanted control.\n\nIn 1965, the area in Africa then known as Rhodesia \u2014 the colonialist name for the region that\u2019s now Zimbabwe \u2014 had established a new regime in the wake of British colonial rule. When the country\u2019s white-supremacist leaders declared its independence late that year, TIME noted that it was \u201cthe first nation in history to launch itself into a world all but unanimous in its hostility.\u201d The U.N. also called it an \u201cillegal racist minority regime.\u201d\n\nBy the time a decade had passed, it was clear to all \u2014 except maybe some white Rhodesians who were in denial \u2014 that the regime would not last much longer in the face of guerrilla resistance at home and disapproval around the globe. In a desperate attempt to stall the coming change, black activists were routinely jailed. Robert Mugabe, a one-time schoolteacher who had become a radical guerrilla, was one of them.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Ian Smith finally conceded that he would allow the nation\u2019s black majority to assume control of their own country, Mugabe was an obvious contender for leadership. But there was conflict over how exactly the transition would take place: \u201cFor years black nationalists have been divided between relative moderates, such as Bishop Abel Muzorewa and the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, and the more extreme forces, which now call themselves the Patriotic Front, headed by Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe,\u201d TIME noted in 1977. \u201cThe moderates, while willing to accept a gradual transfer of power, have also been insisting that black Rhodesians be allowed to choose their leaders in free elections. But the Patriotic Front wants first to take power and then hold elections.\u201d\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nIn 1978, the moderates won. Mugabe and his fellow Patriotic Front leader, Joshua Nkomo, swore they would not accept gradual change. They would keep fighting. Violence rippled throughout the area for about a year more before a compromise was reached. The country would host elections.\n\nIn early 1980, after a bloody campaign and election, Mugabe, then 56, emerged victorious. TIME reported:\n\nundefined\n\n\u201cWe are beginning a completely new chapter with the hope that there will not be any victimization of anybody for political reasons,\u201d Mugabe told the magazine in an interview that week. When he visited the U.S. later that year, the leader of what had become Zimbabwe was greeted with cheers.\n\nWhat Mugabe did with control, however, was less easy to explain.\n\nEven among the cheering and an initial economic boom, guerrilla violence in Zimbabwe didn\u2019t end. And in the years that followed, Mugabe\u2019s grip grew tighter, and his feud with former ally Nkomo threatened to disrupt the entire nation in its wake.\n\nOnly about four years after Zimbabwe\u2019s independence, Mugabe \u201cdeclared his intention to transform the former British colony into a one-party Marxist state,\u201d as TIME put it.\n\nViolence and corruption marked the land-redistribution plan he implemented. Rivals were beaten. Protests were kept quiet. In the face of authoritarian rule and disasters like drought, the population suffered mightily. In 2007, TIME summarized that his \u201crule has yielded 1,700% inflation, an 80% unemployment rate and average life expectancy of 35, the lowest in the world.\u201d\n\nWhen Mugabe lost an election in 2008, he demanded a recount, from which his opponent Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew, and followed that by shutting down international aid within the nation. Even after agreeing in 2009 to share power with Tsvangirai \u2014 who would be the Prime Minister to Mugabe\u2019s President \u2014 he refused to cede power for nearly a decade more, eventually resigning in 2017.\n\n\n\nAnd, all along, Mugabe \u2014 having once fought so hard for power \u2014 held onto it.\n\n\u201cOnly God who appointed me,\u201d he said in 2008, \u201cwill remove me.\u201d", "description": "What Mugabe did with his power, however, was less easy to explain", "authors": ["Lily Rothman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c0QELV6CVmxSGatmY.BsFg--~B/aD05NjU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/6ce0e68ed9228e92c7eec673c9425299", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
