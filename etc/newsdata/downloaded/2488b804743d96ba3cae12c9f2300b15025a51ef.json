You have Apple and Samsung at the top, LG in a distant third, then Motorola, and maybe the occasional wildcard option like Google and OnePlus collectively making up less than ten percent. If that\u2019s all you see when you enter a phone store, you could be forgiven for having lost interest in phones altogether.\n\nAs this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress demonstrated in acute fashion, however, there is a ton of interesting stuff going on outside the States \u2014 and a whole lot of it is coming from China. 2018 was the year that Chinese manufacturers made a firm claim to be producing the most exciting and experimental phone hardware in the world, with wild designs from the likes of Oppo and Vivo. Others are competing on different terms, making phones of surprising quality at prices American buyers could only dream of. And going forward, Huawei and Xiaomi have demonstrated some of the most attractive foldable phone designs yet.\n\nBut for a long and complex list of reasons, barely any compelling Chinese phones go on sale in the US beyond those from OnePlus, a company whose key designs invariably show up in Oppo phones months earlier. And while it\u2019s technically possible to import Chinese phones, we wouldn\u2019t often recommend it unless you\u2019re confident that you won\u2019t run into any issues with unfamiliar software or LTE bands.\n\nJust in case you\u2019re interested, though, here\u2019s what you\u2019re missing in the US right now.\n\nXiaomi Mi 9\n\nXiaomi\u2019s flagship Mi series tends to combine high-end specs, conventional design, and low prices, and that\u2019s certainly the case with the latest entry. The Mi 9 has a notched 6.4-inch OLED display, a Snapdragon 855 processor, up to 12GB of RAM, an in-screen fingerprint scanner, and a triple-camera system with three separate focal lengths.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much groundbreaking about the Mi 9 itself unless you care about wireless charging speed, but Xiaomi\u2019s ability to price a 6GB of RAM/128GB of storage variant for just 2,999 yuan (~$450) continues to be the company\u2019s key advantage. The Mi 9 makes even OnePlus phones look questionably priced, never mind Samsung and Apple.\n\nXiaomi Mi Mix 3\n\nThe Mi Mix is a higher-end line for Xiaomi, and ever since the original model has always been about achieving the most bezel-free design possible \u2014 no notches allowed. That tradition continues with the Mi Mix 3, which uses a magnetic slider mechanism to raise the selfie camera from behind the uninterrupted screen.\n\nThere are certainly tradeoffs with this approach. The Mi Mix 3 is thicker than you\u2019d expect for a phone with just a 3,200mAh battery, and the mechanism isn\u2019t always easy to operate one-handed. You\u2019ll also have to wait until May for the 5G version if you want a larger battery and this year\u2019s Snapdragon 855 chip, and who knows how that\u2019ll turn out.\n\nBut at a starting price of 3,299 yuan (~$475) for a 6GB/128GB model, the Mi Mix 3 is still at least as compelling a value proposition as the Mi 9. Especially if you hold a personal vendetta against notches.\n\nHuawei Mate 20 Pro\n\nYou can\u2019t ignore the political pressure Huawei faces in the US, but the simple fact is that the Mate 20 Pro is a big deal virtually everywhere else. Huawei\u2019s latest flagship is an extremely good handset with an impressive Kirin 980 SoC, a strong triple-camera setup, an excellent curved OLED display, both 3D face-scanning and an in-display fingerprint sensor, and a massive battery that delivers class-leading endurance.\n\nIf hardware were everything, the Mate 20 would have a very strong claim to be the best phone in the world. Unfortunately, it is not, and Huawei\u2019s EMUI software remains one of the least elegant examples of a heavy-handed Chinese Android skin; Xiaomi\u2019s MIUI blows it away in terms of usability. If you can get over the software and the \u00a3899 (~$1,200) price, though, this phone is a serious contender.\n\nHonor View 20\n\nHuawei sub-brand Honor\u2019s latest flagship has the same EMUI drawback, but no-one can complain about the price. Launched a couple of months ago, the View 20 has the same Kirin 980 chip as the Mate 20 Pro alongside a couple of smartphone firsts: a hole-punch LCD and an intermittently great 48-megapixel camera. You also get a large 4,000mAh battery and even a headphone jack.\n\nAll of this comes in at \u00a3499 (~$650), and there\u2019s very little to point to on the View 20 that renders it less than flagship-class. Sure, the Mate 20 Pro has wireless charging, a better camera, and an OLED screen, but overall the View 20 would be an impressive device at any price \u2014 let alone one this reasonable. It\u2019s also the only phone on this list that should eventually get a US release, though we\u2019ll see how that turns out.\n\nVivo V15 Pro\n\nThe V15 Pro is Vivo\u2019s newly announced mainstream flagship, and it brings some of the company\u2019s high-end features from last year to a more accessible device. There\u2019s a 32-megapixel pop-up selfie camera, a speedy in-display fingerprint sensor, a 48-megapixel main camera, and \u2014 of course \u2014 an OLED screen with no notch and barely any bezels.\n\nThis is also the first phone to use Qualcomm\u2019s new mid-to-high-end Snapdragon 675 processor, and performance has been impressive in my testing. At around $400, this is an extremely compelling mid-range device if you can deal with the Micro USB port and lack of wireless charging.\n\nVivo Nex\n\nIf you prefer the smaller pop-up selfie camera design to Oppo and Xiaomi\u2019s more elaborate mechanisms, the highest-end option is still the original Nex. The Vivo Nex has a Snapdragon 845, a 4,000mAh battery, a giant 6.6-inch notchless screen, and both USB-C *and* a headphone jack.\n\nVivo\u2019s subsequent full-screen phones have been more refined in various ways, with improved in-display fingerprint sensors, better-quality selfie cameras, and more sensible screen sizes. But as one of the most decadent and feature-packed phones ever created, the original Nex still makes a statement \u2014 iridescent rainbow-dot pattern and all.\n\nVivo Nex Dual Display Edition\n\nThe Nex Dual Display Edition, on the other hand, makes the original Nex look positively restrained. Its solution to the problem of where to put the selfie camera on a bezel-less phone is\u2026 not to have one at all. Vivo just stuck another screen on the back so you can use it as a viewfinder when the regular camera is pointing at you. The camera is also surrounded by a colorful light-up \u201cLunar Ring\u201d that cuts into the second screen.\n\nThis mostly works fine, apart from the multiple times a day you\u2019ll find yourself taking the phone out of your pocket and staring at a blank screen because the \u201cswitch screens\u201d and \u201cwake\u201d buttons swap functionality based on the phones\u2019 orientation and yet are indistinguishable by feel. But if you want the world\u2019s best selfie phone and don\u2019t mind that it might also be the world\u2019s most fragile phone \u2014 at least until foldables arrive \u2014 this could be for you.\n\nOppo Find X\n\nEven though it was announced the best part of a year ago, the Oppo Find X is arguably still the most beguiling Android phone around. Its curved notchless screen and unique motorized sliding design, where the entire top panel of the phone rises up to reveal a 3D face scanner and selfie camera, make it the most convincing attempt yet at achieving the all-screen dream.\n\nOppo later released the Find X Lamborghini Edition, which keeps the same basic specs but bundles some passable wireless earbuds and introduces one legitimately cool feature. Super VOOC makes use of a custom dual-cell design that allows you to go from 0- to 100-percent charge in just 35 minutes \u2014 an unbelievably fast time for a 3,400mAh battery. The Find X might still be using a Snapdragon 845, but it still feels cutting-edge.\n\nOppo F11 Pro\n\nOppo announced the F11 Pro this week, and it\u2019s similar to Vivo\u2019s V15 Pro: 48-megapixel camera, pop-up selfie camera, headphone jack, Micro USB. It also has maybe my favorite gradient color scheme since China seemingly decided a year ago that all phones should look like this.\n\nThe F11 Pro is a little lower-end than the V15 Pro, though: there\u2019s no in-display fingerprint sensor, the selfie camera is 16 megapixels, and the processor is a MediaTek Helio P70. That\u2019s reflected in the lower price of ~$350, which means it still offers pretty great value for anyone who doesn\u2019t need the highest-end specs around.\n\nRealme 3\n\nThere are literally countless budget Chinese phones I could have included here for the exact same reasons \u2014 this Realme 3 is just the most recent example. Realme is an India-focused brand spun out of Oppo, and its products make our US-targeted \u201cBest cheap phones you can buy\u201d article from last year seem sort of embarrassing.\n\nSure, if you have $180 in the US you can get that LG K30 with chunky bezels, a 5.3-inch LCD, a 2,800mAh battery, 32GB of storage, and 2GB of RAM. Realme 3 customers in India, on the other hand, get a modern-looking 6.4-inch LCD with a tiny notch, a 4,230mAh battery, 32GB of storage, and 3GB of RAM for about $125. It\u2019s also just $30 more for 4GB of RAM and doubles the storage to 64GB.\n\nThough at least the K30 has USB-C.", "description": "The American smartphone market is an increasingly boring place to be.
