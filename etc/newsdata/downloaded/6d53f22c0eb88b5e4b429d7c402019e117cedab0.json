He said the report contained \"numerous factual inaccuracies of a material nature\" and was \"fundamentally flawed\".\n\nAccording to Business Day, in court papers filed on Wednesday, Ramaphosa said the Public Protector acted \"outside of her authority\" and \"lacked jurisdiction\" to investigate the funds which were paid into the CR17 campaign. He reportedly said those donations did not implicate the state, public administration or public affairs in any manner whatsoever. \"They are donations made to a campaign.\"\n\nREAD: Ramaphosa takes Public Protector's 'fundamentally flawed' report on urgent court review\n\nRamaphosa said there were no factual foundation for any suspicion of a prima facie case of money-laundering and Mkhwebane used the law defining corruption to make her \"wholly incompetent\" finding of potential money-laundering about his campaign, Business Day reported.\n\n\"Corruption and money-laundering are two legally distinct concepts. By confusing these two statutes, the public protector has shown a grave misunderstanding of the law,\" he reportedly said, adding that it was \"gravely concerning\" that she appeared to be unable to distinguish between the two.\n\nA number of Mkhwebane's reports have either been set aside or taken under review.\n\nAccording to Business Day, a total of 30 Public Protector reports have been taken on review to date.\n\nIn addition, her fitness to hold office is being examined by Parliament's justice and correctional services portfolio committee.\n\n'Incompetent'\n\nAfter being in office for more than two years, Mkhwebane has faced criticism for some of her reports, and it has been said that she is \"incompetent\" and that her credibility has \"plummeted\".\n\nMkhwebane previously said that her office was going through \"testing times\" and that the institution was faced with attacks from every angle, including the \"most unfair reporting in the media\".\n\nOn July 22, The Constitutional Court agreed with the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria that her entire ABSA/Bankorp investigation was flawed, and that Mkhwebane had not been honest during her investigation.\n\nIn a devastating ruling, the court set aside her report, as well as the remedial action she had recommended, and ordered her to personally pay some of her opponents' legal costs.\n\nPublic Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan also filed court papers on July 10, in an urgent bid to interdict remedial actions in a report released by Mkhwebane on July 5.\n\nALSO READ: Gordhan files review of 'dishonest, reckless' Mkhwebane\u2019s 'rogue unit' report\n\nThe papers were filed in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday and are in response to Mkhwebane's report on SARS and conduct by Gordhan, particularly surrounding the so-called \"rogue unit\".\n\nIn May, Gordhan filed a separate review application of a report by Mkhwebane that relates to the early retirement of former SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay.\n\nIn May, the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria ruled that Mkhwebane failed in her duties to investigate and report on the Vrede dairy project in the Free State.\n\nJudge Ronel Tolmay ruled that Mkhwebane's report was unconstitutional and invalid, and set it aside on the grounds that she failed in her duties to investigate and report on the controversial project.\n\nThe High Court said the Public Protector acted irrationally by neglecting a complaint laid in May 2016 regarding the project.\n\nAccording to Business Day, Ramaphosa's application for an interdict to suspend Mkhwebane's remedial action is scheduled to be heard on August 12.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
