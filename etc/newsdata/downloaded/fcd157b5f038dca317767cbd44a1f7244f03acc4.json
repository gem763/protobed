In real life today, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is panicking and telling us the oceans are rising and the end of the world is near because of climate change.\n\nBoth warnings of doom and gloom are equally melodramatic and overwrought.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. \u2013 who pretends she\u2019s an expert on climate, energy and the superiority of her beloved socialism \u2013 has been receiving a lot of criticism for her statement last week claiming that because of climate change, Miami may not exist in a few years.\n\nAOC APPEARS TO CLAIM MIAMI WILL BE GONE 'IN A FEW YEARS' BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nSpeaking at an NAACP forum to drum up support of her radical multitrillion-dollar Green New Deal that would bring economic disaster to the U.S., the freshman congresswoman said:\n\n\"What is not realistic is not responding to the crisis \u2013 not responding with a solution on the scale of the crisis. \u2026Because what's not realistic is Miami not existing in a few years. That's not realistic. So, we need to be realistic about the problem.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of nots. Or not.\n\nTo lose Miami or not to lose Miami, that is the question.\n\nWell, my advice to the good people of Miami and their friends and relatives in other parts of the country is to take what Ocasio-Cortez says with a grain \u2013 make that a ton \u2013 of salt. She has absolutely no idea what she is talking about.\n\nKeep in mind that Ocasio-Cortez said not too long ago that the world would become unlivable in 12 years unless we made massive changes \u2013 including some that are scientifically impossible \u2013 to all our energy choices and the way we live our lives. When her prediction of the end of the world drew ridicule, she backpedaled and said she was only being sarcastic.\n\nSure she was.\n\nStatements like those by Ocasio-Cortez make the climate change crusade looks as hyperbolic and devoid of science as many know it is. Even people without advanced degrees in climatology or geology (like AOC herself) know her absurd statements are demonstrably untrue. A few years is a relatively short period of time, and for her statement to be even remotely true, we would need to see evidence of rising waters every single day.\n\nHow will Miami, or all coastal cities, succumb to the seas? Will it be a slow encroachment \u2013 a constant rise of tides that every day inch higher and higher? Because if that\u2019s the case the locals should be able to observe tomorrow, or next week, something measurably different in their coastal surroundings than they do today.\n\nOr will Miami be flooded like it was in the movie \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow,\u201d in which a giant wave washes over the city? If this happens, where would the wave originate? It must be from the melting ice caps, something we hear about constantly, right?\n\nDon\u2019t bet on it.\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years since former Vice President Al Gore said on this video: \u201c\u2026 some of the models suggest \u2026 that there is a 75 percent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during summer, during some of the summer months, could be completely ice-free within the next five to seven years.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month a group of climate change activists en route to document the vanishing ice needed to be rescued halfway between the North Pole and Norway. Their boat, the Malmo, got stuck in ice.\n\nThere is another way to create such giant waves: King Triton can generate them. For those of you not familiar with his majesty, he is the king of the seas in the Disney cartoon \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d The cartoon came out in 1989 \u2013 the same year Ocasio-Cortez was born. Perhaps the congresswoman can subpoena King Triton to testify before Congress.\n\nAccording to Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 and many other Democrats, including some presidential candidates \u2013 climate change is the most important issue facing us today and no sacrifice is too great and no program too costly to fight it. It is the equivalent of an earlier generation\u2019s fight in World War II \u2013 or maybe even bigger.\n\nI have to disagree.\n\nLast year in America more than 70,000 people died of opioid overdoses. Every night more than 500,000 homeless people sleep on our nation\u2019s streets. Each day 20 of our military veterans and active-duty military service members commit suicide on average \u2013 maybe one of them while you are reading this.\n\nNone of these issues is granted the same soaring rhetoric of moral consequence as climate change, let alone hours of televised presidential town halls like the recent seven-hour marathon on CNN.\n\nAnd while there are real human, material and moral needs in America, there is also much to celebrate, especially in an industry that is repeatedly and willfully maligned by the left-wing climate warriors: the fossil fuel industry.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLast year New Mexico had a budget surplus of $1.2 billion, thanks to oil and gas revenue. When leftists clamor for funding programs to benefit children, the poor, migrants and other groups, this is where the money comes from. Employment in this field continues to grow at 1.7 percent and most of these jobs do not require expensive four-year college degrees.\n\nAll this while carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 the very \u201cpollutants\u201d that give climate activists nightmares \u2013 continue to decrease. I don\u2019t see anyone applauding this.\n\nSaying Miami will be gone in a few years is a silly comment that deserves criticism. But more so, the effort to brand climate change a moral crisis worthy of bankrupting our economy and eliminating the jobs of millions of Americans needs to stop.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe fossil fuel industry is not America\u2019s enemy, and political leaders like AOC should either temper their words or reject the very oil, gas, coal, electricity, plastic, and inexpensive food and material goods that make help America the greatest place on Earth.\n\nAnd as for Miami, I have confidence the city will be around for a very long time to come \u2013 even long after Ocasio-Cortez has retired from public life.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DANIEL TURNER", "description": "Rep.
