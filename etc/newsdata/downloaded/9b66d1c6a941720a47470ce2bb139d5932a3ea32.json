So they do it.\u201d\n\nThe visits that have drawn perhaps the most scrutiny are those by officials of foreign governments. Their frequency has led to allegations that Mr. Trump is violating the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution by accepting foreign government funds.\n\nThe single biggest known tab was paid by the government of Saudi Arabia, which disclosed that it spent $190,273 at the Trump hotel in early 2017, as well as an additional $78,204 on catering.\n\nThe hotel has on an almost daily basis drawn visits from foreign officials. This week it was Imran Ismail, the governor of a Pakistani province who was in Washington to meet with the State Department and members of Congress to discuss human rights issues in Kashmir, among other topics. The visit was first noticed by Zach Everson, who runs the 1100 Pennsylvania newsletter.\n\nJose Manuel del Gallego Romualdez, the Philippine ambassador to the United States, explained his own reasoning for scheduling an event at the hotel last year.\n\n\u201cThe Trump hotel may have some political undertones because it is associated with the U.S. president,\u201d Mr. Romualdez wrote in a column in a Philippine newspaper. \u201cBut since several other embassies have also held their national day celebrations at the Trump hotel, which were well attended \u2014 I decided \u2014 why not do it there, too.\u201d", "description": "To ethics lawyers, the most extraordinary aspect of the daily merging of President Trump\u2019s official duties and his commercial interests is that it has now become almost routine.", "authors": ["Eric Lipton", "Annie Karni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/us/politics/08dc-trumphotels-p1sub/08dc-trumphotels2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
