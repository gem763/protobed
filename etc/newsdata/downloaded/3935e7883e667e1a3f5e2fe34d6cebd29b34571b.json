The 27-year-old singer glowed as she posed in a plunging red-and-white dress with matching red lipstick\n\nGomez opened up to Ryan as she wore a striped sweater.\n\nThe host asked how she feels dropping these heartbreaking songs back to back; both fully acknowledge that they are about her heartbreak over Bieber.\n\nJustin broke up with Selena in March 2018, started dating Hailey in May 2018, proposed to her in July then wed her in September. In early October he wed her for a second time.\n\n'I think I feel a sense of relief, it's been four years since I've been working on this album,' began Selena.\n\nFeeling better: This sighting comes just after the Texas native told Ryan Seacrest she feels 'relief' after sharing her feelings after her ex Justin Bieber started dating 22-year-old model Hailey Baldwin after their March 2018 split\n\nBack when they were happy: They dated again from November 2017 until March 2018\n\nThen this happened: Two months after Justin and Selena split, he started seeing Hailey. They wed in September 2018 and had a formal wedding earlier this month\n\nShe added, 'It\u2019s actually perfect timing because I was going to release it two years ago and none of the words that I\u2019m speaking would have existed.\n\n'So taking a moment to actually feel the feelings that I\u2019ve gone through, it\u2019s just \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m just so grateful that it\u2019s out. It\u2019s weird too because I wrote this song over a year ago \u2026 and it\u2019s like I feel completely different from when I wrote it. ... It\u2019s such an interesting feeling.\n\n'It's more beautiful for me because I know exactly where I was when I wrote it and how I felt.\n\n'It would have been too hard to release it when it was written, now it's fun, I am smiling. It's all the feelings right? It's everything from happy to emotional to realizing it and being frustrated. I wanted to validate all those feelings.'\n\nShe has moved on: 'I think I feel a sense of relief, it's been four years since I've been working on this album,' began Selena. 'It's actually perfect timing, because I was going to release that two years ago. None of the words that I am speaking would have existed but now I feel the feelings I have gone through'\n\nSo much pain: Ryan asks her about seeing Justin with Hailey and how difficult that must have been. 'I have actually experienced that a million times before, that's very unfortunate,' she said. 'I had become numb to it and it would be stupid if I didn't acknowledge it, it's extremely real,' she said\n\nRyan asks her about seeing Justin with Hailey and how difficult that must have been.\n\n'I\u2019m really grateful too because I\u2019ve actually experienced that a million times before and that\u2019s the unfortunate part about what I do,' she admitted.\n\n'It\u2019s all very real to me and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just entertainment for other people; but I think I had become numb to it and it would be stupid of me if I didn\u2019t acknowledge what I had felt because it would be inauthentic and that\u2019s everything I claim to be and do.\n\nNew art: Selena, seen with SiriusXM Hosts Tony Fly and Symon, told Ryan, 'I also described this negative space and take steps back.' She added she waited so long to 'express what I felt' because she wants to express 'exactly' how she felt. 'This is where it turns into art,' she said\n\nJust doing what all artists do: And Gomez added that the reaction shocks her because everyone writes about something they felt and the biggest topic is love so it only makes sense that she would write about her heartbreak\n\nReady to talk: Here she is seen on air on the Sirius show on Thursday\n\nAll a go: She was on Hits 1 Hollywood; the star was asked over and over about Lose You To Love Me\n\n'I know there are thousands of people \u2026 who have felt this feeling and it\u2019s extremely real, and on top of the social media and everything, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in my position or someone else\u2019s because you\u2019re always going to somehow find this negative space and that\u2019s why I have to be careful and I just have to take steps back and just focus on what I\u2019m doing and nobody else.'\n\nShe added she waited so long to 'express what I felt' because she wants to express 'exactly' how she felt.\n\n'This is where it turns into art,' said the brunette.\n\nAnd Gomez added that the reaction shocks her because everyone writes about something they felt and the biggest topic is love so it only makes sense that she would write about her heartbreak.\n\nHonest approach: She was also seen on the same day on the Ryan Seacrest radio show\n\nOver him: She added her favorite video was The Heart Wants What It Wants, and now she gets to release Lose You To Love Me which is like a bookend. 'From going from there to where I am now is the greatest feeling,' she said, making it seem as if she is happy to finally be over Bieber once and for all\n\n'I think that\u2019s why I\u2019ve waited this long to express what I\u2019ve felt... I\u2019m always going to be honest with people. I\u2019ve never not been.\n\n'I might not be overly chatty about it all the time, but this is where I\u2019m able to release it. This is where it turns into art. \u2026 It actually shocks me,.\n\n'Because everyone writes about something they felt \u2026 and the biggest topic is love, and, in a way, it\u2019s not something negative. It\u2019s actually something positive that I was able to experience that was as beautiful and ugly as it was. I think it\u2019s beautiful I\u2019ve been able to turn this into a new chapter.'\n\nLose You To Love Me is a black and white video shot on and it comes off as very 'raw,' she agreed.\n\nThe second video with all the choreography was used with several Phones taped to the walls and 'everywhere really,' she said.\n\nA bow out: She added Look At Her Now is her going into bigger and better things. These two new songs are about 'wrapping up a chapter in a pretty little bow'\n\nShe added her favorite video was The Heart Wants What It Wants, and now she gets to release Lose You To Love Me which is like a bookend.\n\n'From going from there to where I am now is the greatest feeling,' she said, making it seem as if she is happy to finally be over Bieber once and for all.\n\nThe two have a very long history - they started dating in 2011.\n\nShe added Look At Her Now is her going into bigger and better things.\n\n'All I know is these two songs were me wrapping up a chapter in a pretty little bow,' she stated.\n\nAnd she added that the rest of the songs on the album are about how she is now and promised, 'I've saved the best for later.'\n\nThe day before she told E! News: 'I wrote [Lose You To Love Me] over a year ago. It's obviously a very emotional song for me.'\n\nYup it's about him! The star onfirmed Lose You To Love Me is about ex Justin Bieber as she told E! News that it was written over a year ago and it's 'obvious' she had been 'going through something at the time'\n\nYes, it is obvious: In the song she says the man who broke her heart replaced her after two months; Bieber started seeing Hailey two months after their split\n\n'It's interesting to see how far I've come from that point to now,' she added.\n\n'Me sharing my story is exactly what I've always done. I can't be unauthentic. I can't pretend that I'm not going through something when it's obvious that I had been.'\n\nSelena - who was involved in an on/off relationship with Justin over a number of years - hopes her fans can relate to her new single.\n\nShe shared: 'It's one of those songs where I just feel like it's out, it's released and I hope that girls and guys all over the world can feel supported. That's a feeling everyone's felt.\n\n'That was something that I needed to do for myself regardless of what was [going to] come after.'\n\nMeanwhile, a source recently said that Selena's single is 'obviously' about Justin.\n\nThumb's up: Meanwhile, Selena's friend Taylor Swift called the Los You To Love Me song 'perfect.' Taylor, Justin and Selena in 2011\n\nThe brunette beauty doesn't mention Justin by name in the song, but according to an insider, the track relates to the 'Love Yourself' hitmaker rather than The Weeknd, who Selena has also dated.\n\nThe source explained: 'Although the song Lose You to Love Me was co-written and a collaboration, Selena was very involved in writing and creating it, and the song is obviously about Justin.\n\n'Her fling with The Weeknd did not inspire the song - their relationship was much more short-lived and not deep enough to inspire it.'\n\nShe has now been linked to 26-year-old Niall Horan.\n\nMeanwhile, Selena's friend Taylor Swift called the Los You To Love Me song 'perfect' and a 'triumph.'", "description": "This sighting comes just after the Texas native told Ryan Seacrest she feels 'relief' after sharing her feelings after her ex Justin Bieber started dating 22-year-old model Hailey Baldwin after their split.", "authors": ["Heidi Parker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20147334-0-image-a-111_1571943863483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
