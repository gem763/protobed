Photo: Courtesy of the vendor\n\nWe\u2019ve been coveting a pair of Uggs slippers ever since we learned Andre Leon Talley can\u2019t live without his. Back in the early days of the Strategist he told us: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like them. I didn\u2019t want to wear Uggs for years. I thought, \u2018Oh, Uggs.\u2019\u201d But: \u201cOnce you put on an Ugg, you never turn back.\u201d They\u2019re often just a little too pricey to justify, but right now this pair of pale-pink mule slippers (that are a wee bit Elle Woodsian, and which Jennifer Lawrence, Dakota Johnson, and Zendaya have been photographed wearing), are half off. The \u201csheepskin sockliner\u201d apparently wicks moisture away so your dogs don\u2019t start sweating, and the \u201cTreadlite by Ugg\u201d outsole means you can hustle down the stairs or retrieve the newspaper outside without slipping. Note: They run big, so it\u2019s suggested you order down a size.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
