REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\nDubai-based Emirates has 150 of the 350-400-seat model on order, of which eight were originally slated for delivery next year, and has yet to firm up orders for 40 of Boeing\u2019s mid-size 787 jets.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest operator of long-haul aircraft is also in talks to complete an order for 70 Airbus jets, with both sets of negotiations in focus ahead of the Dubai Airshow in November.\n\nBoeing suspended load testing on its new 777X in September, when media reports said a cargo door failed a ground test. There have also been issues with its General Electric (GE.N) GE9X engine, the largest ever produced for an airliner.\n\nThe plane was originally due to enter service with Emirates in June 2020. In an interview, Clark said Emirates no longer expects to receive the first 777X before \u201cApril or the second quarter\u201d of 2021.\n\n\u201cThat has conditioned everything else,\u201d he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Airlines 2050 conference in London.\n\n\u201cFirst of all I want to know when the thing\u2019s going to come,\u201d he said. \u201cOur fleet plans are very much driven by when these aircraft are going to be delivered to us.\u201d\n\nThe airline\u2019s capacity growth is being held back by the delivery delays and will resume only \u201cwhen I get some visibility on all this\u201d, Clark said.\n\nA Boeing spokesman said the U.S. manufacturer was working through its \u201cdisciplined development process\u201d to prepare the 777-9 for its first flight and delivery to launch customers.\n\nIn September, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said it was \u201cworking towards entry into service (of the 777X) by the end of 2020,\u201d subject to the availability of engines.\n\nThere has been speculation that Emirates could defer or reduce 777X orders, or else downgrade some to the smaller 787.\n\nClark told the Seattle Times in June that Emirates was discussing a combination of 777Xs and 787s that may preserve overall numbers but substitute some jets and defer others.\n\nINDUSTRY PROMISES\n\nPlanemakers already face pressure over late deliveries of smaller aircraft, with Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX grounded following two accidents and Airbus\u2019s A320neo hit by industrial delays. But the November air show is expected to test airlines\u2019 leverage in negotiations for some of the industry\u2019s biggest jets.\n\nWhile Boeing tries to finalise its 787 deal, Airbus will be hoping to complete an order for 40 similar-sized A330neo and 30 A350 jets which Emirates tentatively ordered in February when Airbus decided to halt production of its flagship A380.\n\nAsked about the status of new Airbus orders, Clark stressed the importance of keeping costly assets working reliably.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve probably heard me say in the industry, I want aircraft that will give me 99.9% dispatch reliability from day one. Until they can contract for that, we\u2019re not going to take them.\u201d\n\nAn Airbus spokeswoman said the A330 family has a dispatch reliability - or the proportion of departures without technical problems - of 99.4%, with the A350 already at 99.9%.\n\nClark said the aerospace industry had \u201cover-promised\u201d in recent years, placing jets in the market before they had the technical maturity to deal reliably with hot Gulf conditions.\n\n\u201cThe engines in particular have got to be able to do that, and I\u2019m not quite sure they are there yet.\u201d\n\nHe also said Emirates would begin flying to Mexico City as planned on Dec. 9, despite a successful challenge by Delta Air Lines\u2019 (DAL.N) partner Aeromexico against a bilateral government pact underpinning the new route.\n\n\u201cThis is Aeromexico and Delta making life difficult for us,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThere will be a legal wrangling going on, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re going to fly.\u201d\n\nDelta referred queries to Aeromexico which had no immediate comment.", "description": "Delivery delays to Boeing's 777X jetliner are holding back Emirates' growth and could partially affect the Gulf carrier's broader fleet requirements, airline President Tim Clark said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Laurence Frost", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442033816&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G22J", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
