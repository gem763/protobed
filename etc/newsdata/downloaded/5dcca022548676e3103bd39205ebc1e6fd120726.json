I telephoned Julie's house and I got no reply, I just thought oh she's slept in.\n\nI drove down the house and when I got there the curtains were closed, the doors were locked and my gut feeling just felt something wasn't right.\n\nJulie's brother investigated and found the house was unusually clean, prompting the pair to phone the police.\n\nDespite 'bragging' about her death, Billy was not sent to prison as an 800-year-old law prevented him from being re-tried after being found not guilty\n\nAnn became emotional on new BBC 2 series 'Catching Britain's Killers: The Crimes That Changed Us' where she opened up about her daughter's death, which would finally challenge this ancient 'double jeopardy' law\n\nAnn continued: 'Looking at the house now, when I'm back to that day all the emotions are back there again. Thinking that was the day I came down and she just wasn't there.'\n\nPolice originally treated Julie's case as a missing person, and three months after her disappearance her family decided to move her son Kevin back into her home with his father.\n\nAnn told: 'There was a smell. I'd gone down the house on the lunchtime to see if he'd got rid of the smell, and he opened the door and he said, \"it's getting worse\".\n\n'So I went and had a look myself. At that point i'd worked in an operating theatre for 20 years and I just knew what the smell would be.'\n\nViewers took to Twitter to praise Ann for being 'truly inspirational' after spending the best part of two decades fighting to bring her daughter's killer to justice\n\n'I'm going up the stairs to the bathroom inside I'm screaming please god don't let it be Julie.\n\n'As I leaned over the bath to smell the wall and where it was loose, it wobbled and the smell became stronger, so I pulled it open. She was under the bath.\n\n'She was my daughter, at least she was found. But you knew that your worst nightmare was coming true .'\n\nAfter her mutilated and partially decomposed body was found, it was discovered that Julie's body had been subject to 'violent sexual assault.'\n\nPolice began investigating by collecting evidence gathered from semen found on Julie's bed and began looking into her private life.\n\nAnn Ming appeared on new BBC 2 series 'Catching Britain's Killers: The Crimes That Changed Us' where she revisited the house her daughter disappeared from\n\nShe became emotional while looking at the home that she found her daughter's mutilated and partially decomposed body was found behind a panel on the bath\n\nIt was found that Dunlop, a violent individual, was the prime suspect after evidence against him including fingerprints were found on Julie's keys, located under the floorboards.\n\nIn May 1991, Dunlop stood trial for Julie's murder in Newcastle Crown Court but was not found guilty because the jury failed to come to a conclusive verdict, after Dunlop claimed that evidence had been planted against him.\n\nRevisiting the courthouse, Ann admitted: 'I can picture him just down there. I didn't think I'd feel this funny, but I suppose it's because it's taking you back. We sat here.\n\n'You wanted to shout down \"why are you saying things like that?\". But you can't, and it's horrible.'\n\nAnn is seen revisiting Newcastle Crown Court where in May 1991, Dunlop stood trial for Julie's murder in but was not found guilty as the jury failed to come to a conclusive verdict\n\nAnn became emotional while revisiting the courtroom and reflecting on the trial of her daughter's killer admitting 'I can picture him just down there'\n\nNine years after Julie's murder, in 1997, Dunlop stabbed his ex-girlfriend with a carving fork and beat up her lover, and was sentenced to seven years in prison for grievous bodily harm.\n\nWhile in prison, the killer bragged to a guard that he had murdered Julie but would never be able to go to prison for it because of the, 'double jeopardy' law meaning an individual couldn't be re-tried once they'd been cleared of the crime.\n\nRevealing what her lawyer told her at the time, Ann recalled: 'He said \"we know he's bragging, but nothing can be done because of the double jeopardy law\".\n\n'You just felt in a state of limbo there was no closure and he was walking free bragging he'd killed her.\n\n'There was nothing you could do, you can't bring her back but you want justice.'\n\nAfter 15-years of campaigning from Ann, in 2006, 17 years after her death Dunlop was found guilty and jailed for life for the murder of Julie Hoggs\n\nWith the help of Brian Mckenzie, a leading police officer the mother began campaigning, determined to change the law and see her daughter's killer face justice.\n\nAnn campaigned alongside the family of murdered black teenager, Stephen Lawrence.\n\nEventually, a letter written to her MP got her an appointment with then home secretary Jack Straw and few weeks later, a retrospectively applying bill was passed, which meant Dunlop would once again go on trial.\n\nIn 2006, 17 years after her death, Dunlop was found guilty and jailed for life for the murder of Julie Hoggs.", "description": "Julie Hogg's mother Ann Ming from Teeside became emotional as she retold the story of her daughters brutal murder and her battle for justice on the BBC2 show Catching Britain's Killers.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/08/19824698-0-image-a-14_1571296849856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
