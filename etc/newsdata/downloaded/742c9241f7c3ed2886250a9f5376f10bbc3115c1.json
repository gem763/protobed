Although their offense is heavily left-handed, they don\u2019t exactly mash right-handed pitchers. Verlander doesn\u2019t have platoon splits either. Anything short of seven innings and nine strikeouts would be disappointing. It\u2019s not hard to imagine this turning into a complete game shutout. If Verlander has one weakness this year, it\u2019s home runs. He\u2019s allowed a career-worst 1.54 HR/9.\n\nAlso Consider: Chris Bassitt, Yu Darvish, Andrew Heaney, Joey Lucchesi\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nPete Alonso \u2013 New York Mets (vs Drew Smyly)\n\nStory continues\n\nAlonso is the top hitter in the slate thanks to his massive power and matchup against an eminently homer prone pitcher. Smyly is a fly ball pitcher who has allowed 2.76 HR/9. While he\u2019s been better since joining the Phillies, he\u2019s still allowed over 2.00 HR/9. Although the entire Mets stack is viable, Alonso is by far the likeliest Met to answer with a deep fly. In fact, he\u2019s projected for just shy one half a home run. That\u2019s unheard of. He\u2019s also one of the best dollar-for-dollar values among top hitters.\n\nAlso Consider: Wilson Ramos (value), Brian McCann (value), Cody Bellinger, Freddie Freeman, Shohei Ohtani, Paul Goldschmidt\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nGavin Lux \u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers (vs Tyler Beede)\n\nLux has yet to supply his owners with the gaudy stats we\u2019re craving. It\u2019s only a matter of time. He\u2019s a hard contact and line drive machine. Beede has shown no ability to limit hard contact. In fact, his 46.4 percent hard contact rate is third worst among pitchers with more than 90 innings (Adrian Sampson and Jhoulys Chacin are worse). Lux projects comparably with all the best non-Altuves at the position and comes at a massive discount.\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Altuve, Nick Solak (value), Ty France (value), Jeff McNeil\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nJ.D. Davis \u2013 New York Mets (vs Drew Smyly)\n\nDavis is right there with his teammate Alonso when it comes to value, projection, and potentially massive ceiling. He projects to supply a one-in-three chance for a home run, and there are multiple alternative ways for him to deliver helpful production thanks to his role in the heart of the lineup. As a ground ball hitter, he has an additional advantage versus a fly ball guy like Smyly.\n\nAlso Consider: Alex Bregman, Justin Turner, Josh Donaldson, Solak (value)\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nAlex Bregman \u2013 Houston Astros (vs Yusei Kikuchi)\n\nBregman was also the top value at third base. If you\u2019re playing on a platform where he qualifies at both positions, he fits better at shortstop. There are comparably projected third basemen tonight whereas none of the shortstops are within a point of Bregman.\n\nAt the heart of this recommendation is a juicy matchup between Bregman and an exploitable Mariners pitching staff. Kikuchi, a southpaw, has coughed up 2.06 HR/9 to go with a 5.36 ERA. When it comes to inducing whiffs and strikeouts, he\u2019s well below average. Bregman\u2019s combination of discipline, contact skills, and power with a mid-lineup role promises multiple avenues to DFS gold.\n\nAlso Consider: Trevor Story, Corey Seager (value), Amed Rosario (value), Trea Turner, Jonathan Villar\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nMike Trout \u2013 Los Angeles Angels (at Dylan Covey)\n\nThere\u2019s never much to say about Trout. He\u2019s the second-best hitter tonight, although he\u2019s also the most expensive bat. It\u2019s worth your while to pony up the cash as he\u2019s very like to deliver a saucy performance against Covey and a bad White Sox bullpen at homer friendly Guaranteed Rate Field. He\u2019s projected for a little better than one-third of a home run.\n\nJaylin Davis \u2013 San Francisco Giants (at Tony Gonsolin)\n\nIf you want to afford a smattering of the very expensive players listed above, you\u2019re going to need a bargain basement player who doesn\u2019t force you to sacrifice production. That\u2019s Davis. He\u2019s a low-angle, hard contact machine who managed to hammer 35 home runs in 541 minor league plate appearances this season. That\u2019s quite an accomplishment for somebody with a near-50 percent ground ball rate. Davis is in luck tonight. He\u2019ll face a fly ball pitcher at Dodgers Stadium. While the park isn\u2019t known as a homer haven, it\u2019s one of the best venues for a certain type of fly ball labelled a \u201chigh drive.\u201d There\u2019s around a one-in-four chance Davis will go deep tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Mike Trout, Bellinger, Ronald Acuna, Yordan Alvarez, J.D. Davis (value), Willie Calhoun (value)", "description": "Brad Johnson finds the best MLB DFS Plays for Saturday, September 7.
