None have neat solutions, nor do they ignore complexity. Their approaches are all utterly different, in an exhibition that has painting and sculpture, film and digital imagery, theatricality and documentary, horror and humour.\n\nWith the help of 40 volunteers, Oscar Murillo brought his audience of 23 clothed and painted papiermache figures to Margate from his London studio by train, in wheelchairs. Now the figures sit, in their workclothes, in rows of church pews, in front of a huge gallery window overlooking the sea. Except the view is obscured by a huge black drape that partially sags open, giving a small view on to the sky. Dumbfounded, expectant, laughing, gawping and bemused, they stoically wait for work, to travel, for something. Some have metal pipes driven through their stomachs, stuffed with burned corncobs and ashes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Oscar Murillo\u2019s papier-mache figures.

Between these curtains hangs John Watson Nicol\u2019s 1883 oil painting Lochaber No More, depicting a Scottish couple surrounded by their few possessions (and a dog) on the deck of a boat taking them from their homeland to America during the Highland Clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries. Murillo\u2019s figures have a world behind them but nothing, not even the sea or the possibility of escape, before them. Bringing these figures to Margate, he strands them at the edge of the world.\n\nTai Shani takes us even further, to a voluptuous imaginary city whose fantastical architecture, all pink and laid out with ziggurats and cylindrical columns, resinous puddles and spheres, lies at our feet. Overhead dangle bejewelled udders and fleshy asteroids. A huge arm and outstretched green hand comes to rest in the middle of the spotlit metaphysical architecture. I am reminded of Giacometti\u2019s surrealist 1932 sculpture The Palace at 4am, rejigged for a sci-fi space opera.\n\nShani\u2019s tableau cries out for living, breathing, moving bodies. For now, we have a stage, filled with sculptural elements, an ambient soundscape by Let\u2019s Eat Grandma, a video of a speaking head, whose words can be heard on headphones. There will be live performances of Shani\u2019s long, 12-part DC: Semiramis at Turner Contemporary over three evenings in November.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest DC: Semiramis by Tai Shani.

The book describes a city as sanctuary, an allegorical space for real, imaginary and mythical women from the past, present and future. Were it not for all the sex and violence, Shani\u2019s is an almost childlike invention. Her cast of self-replicating characters impregnate themselves, slide lubriciously between genders, between life and death. Hugely disarmed by performances I saw at the last Glasgow International at Tramway, I couldn\u2019t make sense of what I saw and heard, yet it stayed with me. Shani\u2019s city sprawls, psychologically as well as physically. Without live performers, it is a bit arcane and lifeless.\n\nHelen Cammock\u2019s 2018 film The Long Note is, at an hour and 39 minutes, too long. Some of the longueurs \u2013 the camera sliding over the old cannons on Derry\u2019s city walls, rainy views under a bridge crossing the River Foyle, and pylons in the mist \u2013 feel unnecessary. Focusing on the role of women in the Derry peace movement and in civil demonstrations and violence, The Long Note is full of silences and protests, news footage of petrol bombings and water cannons, humour, song and sadness. The interviews are its core.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A still from Helen Cammock\u2019s The Long Note. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nBernadette Devlin McAliskey, the former MP and civil rights leader, talks about her encounters with feminists in the US in the 1970s. \u201cMy introduction to feminism was of white middle-class Americans who had women of colour cleaning their houses. It was the women of colour who gave me another way of looking,\u201d she says. As McAliskey speaks, the camera slides away to Nina Simone, who walks to a piano, sits, and sings the 1960s civil rights anthem I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free, with a rising anger as the song progresses. There is such weight in this segue, but such telling moments get buried in this overlong work.\n\nAll three works in Lawrence Abu Hamdan\u2019s installation derive from the investigation he took part in, with Amnesty International and the Forensic Architecture group (who were nominated for the last Turner prize), into conditions in the Syrian regime prison of Saydnaya, outside Damascus. Prisoners were blindfolded and kept in brutal solitary conditions. Speaking was punishable by death. The prison became a torture and execution centre, and more than 13,000 people are estimated to have died there since 2011.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lawrence Abu Hamdan. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nSound became the only way prisoners could begin to ascertain where they were and the space they inhabited. Hunger and sensory deprivation kept them cowed. Their guards played tricks on them by opening and closing doors, funnelling noise from one part of the prison to another, amplifying the sound of assaults. Working with former prisoners, Abu Hamdan had to resort to stock BBC and Warner Brothers sound effects, and to use foley artist techniques to help them remember \u2013 and describe \u2013 the aural world they had occupied. Abu Hamdan\u2019s \u201cearwitness\u201d testimonies led the artist to rethink space in terms of its acoustic properties, and the way sounds are recalled in memory, and how a mnemonic as much as an original sound can trigger memory in an \u201cacoustic flashback\u201d.\n\nHere, we, too, are in a darkened room, with sounds moving around and through us. Images and text scroll across a glass screen in the centre of the darkness. There is a directness to all this that makes the complexity of his work both unhinging and accessible. Images and text scroll across a glass screen in the centre of the darkness. As much as he has been involved in collaborations with NGOs, and has purposed his work as an investigative tool, Abu Hamdan\u2019s art opens up a world to us, and makes us encounter it and begin to perceive it differently. This is why I think he should win this year\u2019s Turner prize.", "description": "Turner Contemporary, MargateFleeing figures wait, a city cries out for people, Derry women fight for peace, and an earwitness hears tortured Syrians \u2026 we give our verdict on this year\u2019s gripping show", "authors": ["Adrian Searle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44e10eff1f17d3e2dd5f554719c396a475ea175a/0_115_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=61c8047a2ba1a00b84ad878c6e4dd43a", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
