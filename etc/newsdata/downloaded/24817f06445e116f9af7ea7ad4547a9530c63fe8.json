Whereas Amazon started relatively early and also didn't have as much of an enterprise presence; they just had longer to build it out.\"\n\nIn the bigger picture, Google Cloud is making the right investments in hiring and infrastructure \u2014 and it's poised to go from an $8 billion cloud business today to nearly $17 billion in revenue in 2021, the Deutsche Bank research analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note for clients.\n\n\"It's money well spent, and I think they will be able to scale to margins that look more to AWS in the next three to five years,\" Walmsley told Business Insider. \"We don't think, looking three years from now, they'll get to AWS on the same scale, but we think they can get to attractive margins on a three to five year basis.\"\n\nNew hires\n\nUnder Kurian, Google Cloud plans to triple its sales force, in a move seemingly taken from his former employer Oracle. To help manage all that growth, Google Cloud has made some key hires.\n\nKeirstead highlights said the former SAP exec Robert Enslin, Google Cloud's president of global customer operations, is a key hire. Others include Amit Zavery, a vice president and the head of platform, from Oracle; Europe, Middle East, and Africa President Chris Ciauri from Salesforce; Sunil Potti, an engineering vice president, from Nutanix; and Yanbing Li, an engineering vice president, from VMware.\n\nThose hires are a good start, the Deutsche Bank analysts said: It's not cheap to attract hires of that caliber, they said, but it's a worthy investment in helping signal to would-be customers how serious Google Cloud is about winning their business. However, the analysts said, that doesn't automatically translate into winning those big deals.\n\nRead more: Here are 12 of the most important executives leading Google Cloud as it takes on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure\n\nThe 'larger-deal wins are likely to come'\n\nKeirstead sees rising interest from Fortune 500 companies, making him \"confident that the larger-deal wins are likely to come.\"\n\nKeirstead said he hasn't heard about many Fortune 500 companies fully embracing Google Cloud, but winning large deals against AWS or Microsoft will take time. Some of Google Cloud's recent major customer wins include HSBC, Mayo Clinic, Macy's, and KeyBank.\n\nKeirstead said that he recently attended a Google Cloud event in New York City with mostly financial services and banks in attendance. He said that while it's true that most of them weren't Google Cloud customers, there's something to be said for the fact that these old-school institutions were at least taking it under serious consideration.\n\n\"They tend to be cautious buyers that move relatively slowly,\" Keirstead said. \"This will be one of the last big markets that Google Cloud will end up going after. We took some comfort in the fact that some very large banks were there, evaluating Google Cloud.\"\n\nAnother aspect Google Cloud will have to fix is cultural. While Google has traditionally focused on the technology above all else, Walmsley said, it will have to learn how to take customers' concerns more seriously and act on them.\n\n\"That's something culturally that may still encumber them,\" Walmsley said.\n\n'Currying favor' with developers\n\nUnder the legacy IT model, it was the chief information officer or chief technology officer who made major technology decisions, like picking which cloud to use. However, as evidenced by Microsoft's purchase of GitHub, cloud providers are becoming aware that it's increasingly developers who drive IT spending.\n\nHe said, in this sense, Google has an advantage because it's active in open source, the community of developers who write software that's free for anyone to use and download. Google engineers often contribute code to popular projects \u2014 the popular cloud project Kubernetes was even created at Google.\n\nIn comparison, while Amazon's cloud is known as being developer friendly, it has a reputation for using open-source code without giving anything back, Keirstead said. He said that, anecdotally, smaller startups were increasingly looking at building on Google Cloud rather than AWS, which he takes as a reflection of Google's strength in open source.\n\n\"Currying favor with and providing good functional software to the developer community is fairly essential and becoming a big strategy for the cloud providers,\" Keirstead said.\n\nWith developers on Google Cloud's side, Keirstead says what's left is to grow its sales.\n\n\"If they can scale up the leadership team and close the sales gap with Microsoft and Amazon, I think that's all they need to have a legitimate market share in that space,\" Keirstead said.", "description": "From new leadership hires to efforts to triple its sales force, here's why analysts say big companies and banks are starting to consider Google Cloud.", "authors": ["Rosalie Chan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d362214100a2429bd11fa03?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
