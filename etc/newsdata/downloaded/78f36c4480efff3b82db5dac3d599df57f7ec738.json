REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - The date of entry into service of Boeing Co\u2019s ultra-long-range 777-8 wide-body airliner will depend partly on customer demand, an executive said, with the planemaker hoping to win an order from Qantas Airways Ltd to supply the plane for Sydney-London flights.\n\nQantas (QAN.AX) has said it could purchase Boeing\u2019s (BA.N) 777-8 or the rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA) A350-1000 for the world\u2019s longest-ever commercial flights, with hopes of delivery from late 2022.\n\nBoeing said in August it had pushed back the entry into service of the 777-8 beyond its earlier plan for 2022. The larger 777-9, due to enter service first with a shorter range, has faced engine-related delays.\n\n\u201cOur timetable on the 777-8 obviously is still under consideration for when it actually enters service,\u201d Darren Hulst, a senior marketing executive at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told reporters in a telephone briefing from Sydney on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBut it is really more of when the combination of the demand from our customers and how it aligns with the design and production for the 777X as a program,\u201d he said.\n\nHe declined to comment on whether an order from Qantas would accelerate Boeing\u2019s plans for the 777-8, which Boeing also plans to develop as a freighter. Emirates and Qatar Airways have already placed firm orders for the 777-8.\n\nBoeing has put forward a \u201ccompelling offer\u201d to deal with any delays to the 777-8 in its contest against Airbus for planes for Sydney-London flights, Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in August, without providing further details.", "description": "The date of entry into service of Boeing Co's ultra-long-range 777-8 wide-body airliner will depend partly on customer demand, an executive said, with the planemaker hoping to win an order from Qantas Airways Ltd to supply the plane for Sydney-London flights.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441347020&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F08P", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
