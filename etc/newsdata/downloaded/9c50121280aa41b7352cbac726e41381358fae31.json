Mick Jagger And Donald Sutherland Blame President Trump For 'Ruining The World'", "language": "en", "text": "Rolling Stone star Mick Jagger and actor Donald Sutherland took aim at President Donald Trump during the Venice Film Festival on Saturday, the Hollywood Reporter reported. The two men were asked what they thought of activists outside of the red carpet protesting climate change and anti-immigration policies. That's when the bashing began.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely behind that,\u201d Jagger said about the protest. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re doing that because they\u2019re the ones who are going to inherit the planet. We are in a very difficult situation at the moment, especially in the U.S., where all the environmental controls that were put in place \u2014 that were just about adequate \u2014 have been rolled back by the current administration so much that they are being wiped out.\"\n\n\u201cThe U.S. should be the world leader in environmental control but now it has decided to go the other way,\u201d Jagger said, referencing President Trump's decision to pull of the Paris Accord Agreement.\n\nSutherland chimed in, saying the regulations under President Barack Obama \"were barely adequate\" and now Trump is tearing them apart.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re my age, when you\u2019re 85 years old and you have children and grandchildren, you will leave them nothing if we don\u2019t vote those people out of office in Brazil, in London, in Washington,\u201d Sutherland said, referencing President Donald Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \u201cThey are ruining the world. We have contributed to the ruination of it, but they are ensuring it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jagger, he's concerned about political division and where it will lead\n\n\"n so many countries, including my own [England] this last week\u2026 but particularly the U.S, it\u2019s a bit of a sea change. It is not about manners,\u201d Jagger said, adding that he feared \u201cwhere all this polarization and rudeness and lying [is going to lead us].\"\n\nThe two men were at the Venice Film Festival promoting their new film Burnt Orange Heresy.", "description": "Talk about a Hollywood hot take..09/08/2019 19:25:16PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/208/3ea15abc-1972-4fb6-9ac4-165e41c03231.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
