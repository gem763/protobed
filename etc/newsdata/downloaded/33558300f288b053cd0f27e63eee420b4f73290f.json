General Assembly in New York. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nPresident Trump opened his must-see-TV meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday with a self-aware joke.\n\nSomehow, the Miss Universe pageant and Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails soon came up, but not until after Trump had disarmed the crowd with a bit of the old razzmatazz.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made me more famous and I\u2019ve made him more famous,\u201d Trump said to startled laughter in a bland hotel conference room lined with Cabinet officials.\n\nIn the back were reporters poised to shout questions about whether the president had improperly leaned on the new Ukrainian leader to seek out dirt on one of Trump\u2019s leading challengers for reelection.\n\nA White House transcript of a phone call between the two leaders had been released hours earlier, recording Trump asking Zelensky for \u201ca favor.\u201d The call is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry announced Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and marks the latest wrenching plot shift in Trump\u2019s operatic tenure.\n\n\u201cWe spoke a couple times, as you probably remember,\u201d Trump cracked.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019d like to hear every single word, and we give them every single word, and then they\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, about today?\u2019 \u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI think the press would probably like to stay in the meeting, but we have lots of witnesses,\u201d he continued, an apparent reference to the Cabinet officials in the room as well as the phalanx of White House staff that records, transcribes and annotates conversations like the one he had in July.\n\nZelensky, a comedian and television star before he was elected this year, also tried to keep the mood light by noting that \u201cit\u2019s better to be on TV than by phone, I think.\u201d\n\nOn paper, Trump\u2019s day Wednesday looked like a normal, busy presidential trip to the annual U.N. meeting. He convened leaders to talk about the plight of Venezuela, signed a preliminary trade agreement with Japan and met with the leader of El Salvador in addition to the headliner sit-down with Zelensky.\n\nBut the fast-moving story regarding the phone call, the subsequent whistleblower complaint and the unfolding impeachment inquiry dominated the day as it has dominated Trump\u2019s entire stay here, which will wrap up Thursday morning. For as much as Trump complained that the rest of his agenda is ignored in favor of what he labeled \u201ca hoax,\u201d he animated it with further unsubstantiated claims Wednesday that Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, had improperly profited from his father\u2019s government role with business dealings in Ukraine and China.\n\nDemocrats said the transcript reveals a brazen effort by Trump to jump-start corruption investigations he hoped could hurt Biden, and to link Zelensky\u2019s compliance with U.S. military aid Trump had put on hold.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.\n\nHunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nStanding alongside Trump, Zelensky insisted Wednesday that \u201cnobody pushed me\u201d to investigate.\n\n\u201cI think you read everything,\u201d Zelensky said as he and Trump faced the cameras.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved\u201d in U.S. elections, Zelensky continued, as Trump smiled beside him. \u201cNo, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call. It was normal.\u201d\n\nTrump chimed in: \u201cIn other words, no pressure.\u201d\n\nThe meeting on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly was arranged before The Washington Post first reported a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s behavior with a foreign leader who turned out to be Zelensky.\n\nA copy of the whistleblower complaint was delivered to Congress on Wednesday, in between Trump\u2019s meeting with Zelensky and a news conference closing out his packed three days of diplomacy here.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pressure anybody,\u201d Trump said at the news conference, which began with a rambling opening monologue that included references to his promised border wall with \u201canti-climb panels\u201d and a complaint about \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d who stymie his agenda.\n\nTrump kept the Zelensky meeting on his schedule and stuck to the plan to have reporters witness the first few minutes as part of a nothing-to-see-here-folks approach. He had a willing partner in Zelensky, although the young leader appeared a bit pained.\n\nZelensky repeatedly tried to steer the conversation back to his priorities \u2014 the anticorruption platform that got him elected and the five-year-old proxy war with Russia in his country\u2019s east. He said he wants to reclaim Crimea, the territory Russia seized in 2014.\n\nTrump\u2019s praise for that agenda and for Ukraine itself took an odd turn when he said \u2014 falsely \u2014 that a Ukrainian contestant won the Miss Universe contest when he owned it. An Associated Press fact check notes that a Ukrainian woman has never won the Miss Universe title, although several finished in the top 10 during Trump\u2019s tenure from 1996 to 2015.\n\nTrump also noted, \u201cIf you remember, you lost Crimea during a different administration, not during the Trump administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. So you have chance to help us,\u201d Zelensky responded, perhaps sensing that Trump might take things in a dark direction.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I do. But that was during the Obama administration that you lost Crimea, and I didn\u2019t think it was something that you should have,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut that was done a long time ago, and I think it was handled poorly. But it\u2019s just one of those things.\u201d\n\nTrump frequently holds a mirror to his predecessor\u2019s administration to make the claim that he is performing better. Although he claims Obama\u2019s weakness allowed Russia to take Crimea, he also suggests that it is settled business.\n\nAs he has elsewhere, Trump used the sit-down with Zelensky to claim that while Obama sent his country \u201cpillows and sheets\u201d to help fend off Russian aggression, he is sending antitank weaponry.\n\n\u201cBoy, that was a nice question. I like that question,\u201d he said to laughter when a reporter asked whether deleted email messages from Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state might reside somewhere in Ukraine.\n\nTrump mused that indeed they might, and repeated his charge that Clinton was trying to hide something.\n\n\u201cHow she got away with that one is just \u2014 but it\u2019s one of many. And it\u2019s corrupt government. Because we have corruption also, Mr. President,\u201d he told Zelensky. \u201cWe have a lot of corruption in our government.\u201d", "description": "\u201cHe\u2019s made me more famous and I\u2019ve made him more famous,\u201d Trump jokes of the leader at the center of a House impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vAFWJS_-N19LHN83AjPPsAU049A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZQENPWW72AI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
