Europe is now underperforming by a bigger margin than at any time since late 2017.\n\nThat corresponds with a move lower in the euro from around $1.20 to below $1.09. The euro hit a low of $1.03 in January 2017.\n\nEuro zone manufacturing surveys last week were the most recent to miss expectations - although so have some in the United States - and a Reuters story on Monday on German economic institutes preparing to slash German economic growth forecasts again sent the euro hurtling lower.\n\n(GRAPHIC - CESI and EURUSD: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6791/6722/CESI%20and%20EURUSD.png)\n\nMONEY MARKET PRESSURES\n\nRuctions last month in the U.S. \"repo\" market - a market for short-term funding - may also explain why dollars are so in demand.\n\nInterest rates in the $2.2 trillion market for repurchase agreements rose as high as 10% on Sept. 17 as demand for overnight cash from companies, banks and other borrowers exceeded supply.\n\n(GRAPHIC - US overnight repo and libor-OIS spread: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6792/6723/US%20overnight%20repo%20and%20libor-OIS%20spread.png)\n\nBanks and investors called it the most serious disturbance in the U.S. money markets since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\n\nWhile the jury is out on the significance of the spike in repo rates, concerns about a shortage of short dated dollar-denominated funding have increased.\n\nDemand for offshore dollars has also grown sharply, according to cross-currency basis swaps, an agreement in which one counterparty borrows one currency from another institution and lends the same value in a different currency.\n\n(GRAPHIC - Money market pressures and DXY: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6793/6724/Money%20%20market%20pressures%20and%20DXY.png)\n\nRATE EXPECTATIONS\n\nAnd then there is the relatively high yield investors earn on U.S. government bonds versus those in the euro zone.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve has launched a rate-cutting cycle this year, so has the European Central Bank, and expectations are that U.S. rates will remain far higher than other developed markets for the foreseeable future.\n\nMoney markets on balance expect a 25 basis point rate cut to the current Fed rate of 2% in October, but that would still leave rates far above the -0.6% of the euro zone.\n\nOvernight index swaps in the United States all yield more than 1.5% out to a 1-year maturity.\n\n(GRAPHIC - Money market expectations: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/US-EUROPE-RATES/0H001QXB68QL/eikon.png)", "description": "King dollar reigns supreme as U.S. outshines the euro area", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF90348_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
