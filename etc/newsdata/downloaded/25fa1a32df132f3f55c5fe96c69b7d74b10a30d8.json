As fires rage 300 miles north, Southern California\u2019s Getty fire has burned over 600 acres in West Los Angeles and is poised for greater destruction. The area is scrambling to grapple with its own potentially catastrophic weather, as a potentially record-setting Santa Ana wind event sweeps in Tuesday night.\n\nCal Fire officials are saying the Kincade fire could burn for \u201cweeks if not months\u201d\u2014unusual considering that the normal summer wildfire season was considered \u201ccalm.\u201d The National Weather Service, in an unprecedented move, has issued an \u201cextreme red flag warning\u201d for residents of much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties near the Getty fire due as winds pick up and threaten to spread the fire farther, faster.\n\nOn top of all of this, nearly one million California residents are without power after the Pacific Gas and Electric Company shut off power in hopes of preventing additional fires from starting. The company has been accused of being responsible for multiple major fires, including two over the weekend in the Bay Area, when compromised power lines and high winds combined to dangerous result in spite of intentional blackouts in nearby areas.\n\nIf you feel like California\u2019s problem with wildfires keeps getting worse, you\u2019re right. Fifteen of California\u2019s 20 largest fires on record have occurred in the past two decades, and scientists find climate change to be the unambiguous cause fueling these fires to become bigger and more destructive.\n\nA study published in July found the amount of land wildfires burn in California annually has increased by 500 percent since 1972. The researchers analyzed nearly 40,000 wildfires over that time period and found an increase in daytime temperatures was a major factor in why more land was burning.\n\nThe researchers believe that California\u2019s warm season days have seen temperatures increase by nearly 3 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1970s. While other environmental factors are also at work, at the most basic level the increase in temperature contributes to an arid environment\u2014meaning the plants and soil become dried out\u2014which makes it so fires are more likely to consume larger areas.\n\nAlex Hall, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences and director of the Center for Climate Science at UCLA, tells The Daily Beast that temperature increases driven by climate change are certainly a major factor.\n\n\u201cEspecially in the last five years, there\u2019s been a dramatic increase in the intensity of wildfires. That is, in part, driven by an increase in temperature,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThe winds tend to be drier, and they are more likely to spread fire. Warmer temperatures also dry out vegetation more quickly.\u201d\n\nThe state has also experienced longer dry seasons recently. California\u2019s fire season used to start part-way through the summer and end sometime in the early fall when the wet season began. As we\u2019re seeing now, the dry season has at times extended into November or December in recent years, expanding the opportunities for catastrophic fires to engulf large parts of the state.\n\n\u201cThe moment when the rainy season begins is the moment when the fire season largely comes to an end, so there is definitely a timing factor there,\u201d Hall said, noting that there is some variability in the start of the rainy season from year to year.\n\nBut more precipitation can complicate things even further. During wetter years, there\u2019s more opportunity for vegetation to grow, creating fuel that could burn during the next dry year. In a study published in Nature Climate Change last year, Hall examined this phenomenon, finding that California experienced \u201cextreme wetness during the 2016\u20132017 winter\u201d after a number of dry years. The state went on to experience disastrous fires in the years that followed.\n\nCalifornia saw its costliest and most destructive fire season in the state\u2019s history in 2017, which was followed by another costly and destructive fire season in 2018.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge swing between the summer and the winter, in terms of precipitation in California, and then there are huge swings from winter to winter in how much precipitation is received,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThat variability is projected to increase in the future due to a changing climate.\u201d\n\nScientists expect that dry years in California will soon be drier and the wet years will soon be more wet. Hall explained that there could be multiple wet winters in a row, allowing growth to lay in wait.\n\nWhile some effects of California\u2019s destructive fire cycle appear now to be inevitable, what we can try to do now is mitigate the severity events like the fires raging in both halves of California.\n\n\u201cA certain amount of climate change is inevitable,\u201d Hall said. \u201cBut that certainly doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t do anything about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Because if we don\u2019t, the outcomes are just far worse.\u201d", "description": "California's wildfire season is stretching out as both Northern and Southern California burn.", "authors": ["Thor Benson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572395263/191029-Hatmaker-fire-california_zwzcvy", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
