Ah! I remember my first technology lesson as if it were yesterday. I had saved up to visit the Paris rep cinema that had been screening, for the previous 17 years, the full-length cut of Sergio Leone\u2019s Once Upon a Time in the West. Otherwise unviewable in those pre-digital days, it was venerated rightly by spaghetti cineastes as a holy relic and I thought I needed, more than anything on Earth, to see it.\n\nI made my way south from the Gare du Nord along the Rue St-Denis, where, a revelation to my innocent eyes, freelance technological instruction was openly available everywhere. The tutors draped themselves over elegantly distressed ironwork balconies, taunting potential customers with Commodore Amiga 1000 manuals and disconnected Hewlett-Packard Vectra keyboards. It was, in 1985, the most decadent sight I had ever seen. My technological ignorance weighed heavily upon my adolescent mind and, I do declare, I pooled my summer savings and took some lessons there. Lie la lie! Lie la lie lie lie la lie!\n\nIt was not my finest technological experience, but it was my first. And a huge and terrible weight was lifted from me. In the end, I had to wait a further two decades to see that definitive Leone cut. And the delay, as I learned in the intervening years on my own terms, only made the experience sweeter.\n\nAs many have pointed out, whether our prime minister had a sexual relationship with a woman he then recommended for public funding isn\u2019t the story here. Neither is the fact that Arcuri\u2019s alleged \u201cbest friend\u201d, the former Steve Bannon protege and disgraced alt-right agitator Milo Yiannopoulos, maintained to the Daily Mail last week that he had seen bruised evidence of the couple\u2019s encounters. Well, he would, wouldn\u2019t he? Milo is $2m in debt and likes attention.\n\nNeither is the story Arcuri\u2019s claim, on 5 October, to the Daily Mirror, that she could \u201cmake men trip over their dicks\u201d, and the attendant mystery of who these clumsy men might be, with their freakishly long, and yet hazardously flaccid, penises? The real story, and I say this as someone who is by no means Turds\u2019s greatest fan, is that in abandoning his purported relationship with Arcuri, our obviously emotionally tortured prime minister may be throwing away his one true chance for happiness. Like the doorstepped passersby provoked by Turds\u2019s name into uncharacteristic profanities \u2013 \u201cThat filthy piece of toerag!\u201d \u2013 Turds\u2019s uniformly betrayed ex-wives and unspecified child-rearing former mistresses can now barely mention him without vomiting into empty cradles.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Barely suppressed giggly hysteria and infatuated eye contact\u2019: Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri at a technology conference in July 2013. Photograph: Innotech Network/YouTube\n\nAnd any moments of supposed tenderness we are encouraged to witness between Turds and his current partner are crudely stage-managed. The notorious garden furniture long-lens tableaux vivant, released the day after Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop-gate, saw Turds\u2019s blond bob became mysteriously much longer overnight, like a magic cress tub sown with human hair.\n\nBut compare these dreary images to footage of joint public appearances by Turds and Arcuri, at various technology events. Observe the barely suppressed giggly hysteria and infatuated eye contact of two young people totally and undeniably head over heels in love. No footage of Turds with any other woman matches these stolen moments for pure untrammelled emotion. Even as a rampant Remainiac, would you allow your political prejudices to deny the restless Turds perhaps his only chance at such obvious and incalculable joy?\n\nLove is like lightning. It burns everything it touches and it rarely strikes twice. What gnawing need is there in the void of Turds\u2019s soul that drives his corrosive ambition, immolating his family, his friends and even the nation he purports to represent?\n\nSatan, in Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, acknowledges \u201conly in destroying I find ease\u201d and releases Sin and Death into the world out of spite, just as Turds has unleased the forces of Brexit. Could the love of Arcuri plug the black hole in Turds\u2019s heart that is sucking us all to our doom, and making our nation the most hated, and pitied, on Earth? Unless Turds steps back from the void he himself has opened, he will grow old to be remembered as the worst prime minister Britain ever had, a competition in which, at last, he will finally triumph over his old Etonian rival David Cameron, who is merely the second worst prime minister we ever had.\n\nLike the lonely audio-diarist of Beckett\u2019s Krapp\u2019s Last Tape, will a defeated Turds, still in tragic denial, continue to resist the truth that Arcuri could, maybe, have been the one that saved him? \u201cPerhaps my best years are gone. When there was a chance of happiness. But I wouldn\u2019t want them back. Not with the fire in me now. No, I wouldn\u2019t want them back.\u201d\n\nLike Edward VIII, another famous lover and sometime friend of fascists, Turds could walk away from the ambition that will never fulfil him, and may consume us all, and take instead eternal comfort in the arms of love. In time, the axe wounds of Brexit can and must heal. In the meantime, Turds would do well to reflect on the wise words of that undying romantic Philip Larkin: \u201cWhat will survive of us is love.\u201d\n\nStewart Lee\u2019s new book, March of the Lemmings, is available now, as is a download of his last standup show, Content Provider.
