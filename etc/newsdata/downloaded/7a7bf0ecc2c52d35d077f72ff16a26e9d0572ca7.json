It is indoctrination rather than education.\u201d\n\nRead Full Article\n\nThe Trump Investigations: Top Articles\n\nTrump Repeatedly Urged Ukraine to Probe Biden's Son, Wall Street Journal\n\nFuror Then: Trump-Russia. Furor Now: Trump-Ukraine, Daily Beast\n\nRussia Penetrated FBI Spying Throughout Obama Years, Yahoo News\n\nNew York Prosecutors Subpoena Trump's Taxes, Associated Press\n\nNew Support for Yalie's Old Charge vs. Kavanaugh, New York Times\n\nDems Want Kavanaugh Impeachment After New Charge, Washington Post\n\nNYT Editor's Note Walks Back Report on Kavanaugh Charge, Fox News\n\nNY Times\u2019 Handling of Kavanaugh Story Draws Wide Criticism, Politico\n\nOther Noteworthy Articles and Series\n\nQatar-Funded Group Influences K-12 Schools With Big Donations\n\nDaily Caller\n\nA U.S.-based organization funded by Qatar and tasked with furthering the allegedly terror-linked country\u2019s national vision is openly influencing K-12 public school curriculums across America. The Washington-based Qatar Foundation International has disbursed more than $30 million to U.S. public schools to fund Arabic language programs. Schools that accept the grants are required to give access to students, documents show. A legal loophole allows it to avoid registering as a foreign agent, but experts say the group has gone over the line by pushing overt propaganda.\n\n6 Men Tell of Being Sexually Assaulted in the U.S. Military\n\nNew York Times\n\nOn average, about 10,000 men are sexually assaulted by men in the American military each year, according to Pentagon statistics. Overwhelmingly, the victims are young and low-ranking. Many struggle afterward, are kicked out of the military and have trouble finding their footing in civilian life. For decades, the problem has been marked by silence: the silence of victims too humiliated to report the crime; the silence of authorities unequipped to pursue it; the silence of commanders who believed no problem existed; and the silence of families too ashamed to protest. This article relates the experiences of six whom the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs has formally recognized as victims of service-connected sexual assault.\n\nDeadly Fungus, Bacteria Thrive in Nursing Homes\n\nNew York Times\n\nPublic health authorities fear that nursing homes are becoming breeding grounds for C. auris, a germ so virulent and hard to eradicate that some facilities will not accept patients with it. In New York City, for example, 396 people are known to be infected and another 496 are carrying the germ without showing symptoms. In Chicago, half of patients living on dedicated ventilator floors in the city\u2019s skilled nursing homes are infected with or harboring C. auris on their bodies. These patients often cycle back and forth between nursing homes and public hospitals, which can spread the problem. Public health experts say that nursing homes and long-term hospitals are a dangerously weak link in the health care system. They are often understaffed and ill-equipped to enforce rigorous infection control yet continually cycle afflicted patients into hospitals and back again.\n\nMillions of X-Rays, Med Data Viewable Online\n\nProPublica/Bayerischer Rundfunk\n\nMedical images and health data belonging to millions of Americans, including X-rays, MRIs and CT scans, are sitting unprotected on the internet and available to anyone with basic computer expertise. The records cover more than 5 million patients in the U.S. and millions more around the world. In some cases, a snoop could use free software programs, or just a typical web browser, to view the images and private data. This article says reporters \u201cidentified 187 servers \u2014 computers that are used to store and retrieve medical data \u2014 in the U.S. that were unprotected by passwords or basic security precautions. The computer systems, from Florida to California, are used in doctors\u2019 offices, medical-imaging centers and mobile X-ray services.\u201d\n\nIs Ocean Cleanup Botching the Science of Plastic Pollution?\n\nWired\n\nConcerns that the plastic bag you use today be choking fish in the middle of the ocean next year appear to be misplaced. A new study \u2013 although probably not the final word on the subject \u2013 reports that plastics ejected at the coast tend to stick to the coast. This suggests that cleanup efforts should focus on those areas. After all, biodiversity is especially high around the coasts: Think of bustling reefs. The findings raise doubts about the massive efforts of an outfit called Ocean Cleanup, which is focusing its efforts on the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the middle of the ocean.\n\nRepo Men Have Built a Private Surveillance System\n\nVice News\n\nThe Repo Man is turning into Big Brother thanks to a new tool, the Digital Recognition Network. It\u2019s a private surveillance system crowdsourced by hundreds of repo men. They've installed cameras that passively scan, capture, and upload to the network's database the license plates of every car they drive by. The coast-to-coast network is available to people and companies focused on tracking and locating people or vehicles. Highly sensitive information about car owners can be made available to anyone who has access to the tool.\n\nWar on Vaping Will Lead More People to Cigarettes\n\nCity Journal\n\nThe war on nicotine vaping seems to spew ever more smoke than fire. The latest example: public health officials, politicians, and media reacting to a recent outbreak of respiratory illness among vapers of marijuana by failing to warn the public in a clear manner. Instead of explaining the specific danger from vaping a certain kind of THC-infused oil, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and politicians like New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told the public to stop using any kind of electronic cigarette. In City Journal, science writer John Tierney says that's like responding to an outbreak of food poisoning by telling people to stop eating.\n\nAn Eagle Scout's Deadly Fentanyl Empire\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAaron Shamo was a clean-cut Eagle Scout from Salt Lake City who dropped out of college but became a millionaire before his 30th birthday. The internet helped drive his success, but he was no Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. Instead, he made his money deepening the country\u2019s opioid crisis by selling the cheap and dangerous drug fentanyl as oxycodone. At his recent trial resulting in his conviction, prosecutors detailed how white powder up to 100 times stronger than morphine was ordered online from China; shaped into perfect-looking replicas of oxycodone tablets in a press that thumped in Shamo\u2019s basement; and resold online to opioid abusers who paid with their lives.\n\nHow NASA Missed Asteroid Headed for Earth\n\nBuzzFeed\n\nThat was close! In late July an asteroid hurtled just 40,400 miles over Earth \u2013 five times closer than the moon \u2013 became the largest space rock to come so close in a century. But perhaps more alarming than the flyby itself is how much it caught NASA by surprise. The asteroid was the size of a football field, but still our genius scientists and their fancy toys didn\u2019t spot it until about 24 hours before its relatively narrow miss of everyone\u2019s favorite planet. If it had entered and disrupted in Earth\u2019s atmosphere over land, the blast wave could have created localized devastation to an area roughly 50 miles across. This may energize Congress to spend $40 million to design a dedicated surveillance satellite equipped with an infrared telescope to spot incoming asteroids without facing the hassles of weather, the moon, or peering through the obscuring atmosphere like telescopes on the ground.", "description": "RealClearInvestigations' Picks of the Week Sept. 15 to Sept. 21, 2019\nFeatured Investigation:Woke History Is Making Big Inroadsin America's High Schools\nUnder the banner of \u0093ethnic studies,\u0094...", "authors": ["September"], "top_image": "https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/rcinv-home-logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
