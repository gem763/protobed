Pictured: The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall walk through Poundbury in 2016\n\nAnd any extension not only requires normal planning permission from the local council but Duchy approval too.\n\nIn the two-part programme, which airs tonight at 9pm, one resident confessed: 'It's a bit sort of a Marmite place, where you either love it or hate it.'\n\nAnother said: 'I don't think it has soul. It's unlike anywhere else I've been in Dorset,' while their friend told the camera: 'There's a lot of rules and regulations. Like for instance, some people can't even have satellite dishes.'\n\nBut it wasn't all criticism for the project, which first began construction in 1993 and is set to be completed in 2026.\n\nIn the programme, Prince Charles: Inside The Duchy Of Cornwall, the royal (pictured in the documentary) expressed his hopes to still be alive to witness the completion of the project\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, around 3,800 people were living in homes across Poundbury, above\n\nOne shop owner compared the village, which reverts back to architecture prior to the end of the 20th century and prides its self on sustainable building, to a 'film set'.\n\nThe Poundbury stipulations These are the following rules that residents in Poundbury must follow if they are to live there: To not paint or decorate the exterior of the property in any different colours without the consent of Prince Charles\n\nNot to make any alterations or additions in or to the exterior of the property without planning permission and approval from the duke\n\nTo not erect any additional fencing or walls around the property\n\nNot to remove any trees or shrubs which are planted within the boundary of the home\n\nFor no signboard advertisement placard, or house name to be placed in the windows of any houses or on the exterior without approval of the prince\n\nNo caravans or boats should be brought onto the property or placed in the parking spaces Source: Poundbury Management Company (MANCO)\n\n'When you come for the first time it feels like a film set and you can't really believe anyone lives here,' she revealed.\n\nCharles said the idea behind Poundbury was to build a community rather than 'another housing estate' but acknowledges it was met with criticism.\n\n'Everybody was against it, and in the end I was determined to stick to my guns,' he said.\n\n'I got on regardless of the endless criticism... because I've always believed in the long-term.\n\nThe Princes of Wales, who inspects the area twice a year, added: 'I wanted to make sure that this time we did it in a more sustainable way.'\n\nCharles expressed his hopes to still be alive to witness the completion of the project and reflect on his efforts.\n\nWith pride in his voice, he explained: 'I want to be able to potter round on a stick in my dotage saying: \"Did I help to do this?\"'\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, around 3,800 people were living in 1,700 homes across Poundbury, and 35 per cent of housing must be affordable for rental or shared ownership.\n\nThe Duchy estate was established by Edward III to provide a private income for his son and heir to the throne Edward, later known as the Black Prince, and its purpose remains the same today.\n\nEpisode one of Prince Charles: Inside The Duchy Of Cornwall airs at 9pm on ITV on Thursday.", "description": "Speaking on ITV's Prince Charles: Inside The Duchy Of Cornwall, residents bemoaned the many regulations that must be followed when living in the model idyll, set up by Prince Charles in Dorset.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/14/20134382-0-image-a-35_1571925323369.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
