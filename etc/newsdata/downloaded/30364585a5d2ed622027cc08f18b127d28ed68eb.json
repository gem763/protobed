But the buds, which were available Tuesday for $129, aren't important because they're wireless. Rather, it's because they pump the tech giant's Alexa voice assistant directly into consumers' ears.\n\nWith on-board Alexa voice integration, you can use the Echo Buds to do everything you'd do with a standard Echo, while on the go; whether that's checking sports scores, getting updates on deliveries, or making phone calls. The Buds themselves also pack Bose's Active Noise Reduction technology and audio passthrough capabilities to let you better hear what's going on around you.\n\nThe Echo Buds come with attachable wing tips to help them stay securely in your ears.

Others who tried my pair, however, found that they offered decent audio that, if anything, was a bit too low and lacking in bass.\n\nFit and sound quality\n\nThe Echo Buds, like many of the current crop of wireless earbuds on the market, come in a storage case that doubles as a charger. The case, which is matte black and sports the familiar Amazon arrow logo, is significantly larger than both the cases for Apple's $159 AirPods and Samsung's $129 Galaxy Buds.\n\nThe Echo Buds put Alexa in your ear, but the fit can be finicky.

The Galaxy Buds get six hours.\n\nTo use the Echo Buds, you'll need to download the Alexa app for your Android or iOS device. The setup process is as seamless as setting up a new Echo speaker and includes a video tutorial explaining the different features available with the Buds.\n\nAmazon didn't make the Buds as distinct looking as, say, Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods, but unlike the standard AirPods, the Buds are water resistant.\n\nIn the box, Amazon includes small, medium, and large ear tips that you can slide on and off the Echo Buds, as well as option wing tips to better secure them in your ear. The ear tips are key to getting the best sound out of the Buds, since a tighter seal in your ear ensures better audio quality.\n\nBut regardless of which tip I used, I wasn't able to find one that comfortably fit my ears. I even tried mixing the tips between ears, using a large in one, and a medium in the other, but still couldn't find the right fit.\n\nA view of the Echo Buds without their wing tips.
