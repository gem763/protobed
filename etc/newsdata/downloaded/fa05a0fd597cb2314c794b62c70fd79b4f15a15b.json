So we should treat her as simply another member of the London tech community.\u201d\n\nIt is understood the redacted name of the adviser is due to be released to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as it decides whether to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct in public office against Johnson.\n\nAn official at the Greater London authority formally referred the allegations to the IOPC last month because Johnson headed the mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime as part of his role. It is expected to make a decision on whether to investigate by the end of October.\n\nThe prime minister has insisted \u201cfull propriety\u201d was followed and he has no interest to declare over Arcuri.\n\nThis week, Arcuri confirmed she shared a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with Johnson, but she insisted she was not given favourable treatment by the then mayor or his officials. She also denied that \u00a3126,000 in public money she was awarded was related to her friendship with Johnson.\n\nIn an interview with ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, she also recalled the first time she met Johnson at a gathering of venture capitalists in 2011. The Guardian has uncovered pictures of the event that took place exactly eight years ago on Friday. It was prosaically marked in Johnson\u2019s official diary as a five-minute speech at the Landmark Hotel, Marylebone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jennifer Arcuri said Johnson \u2018changed the complete energy of the room\u2019 when he spoke to the gathering in October 2011. Photograph: Jim Varney\n\nArcuri\u2019s recollection of the event is more vivid. She told ITV: \u201cI turned around and there\u2019s this guy that walks in the room with his hair all disheveled and his shirt\u2019s untucked and papers that looked like something I pulled out of my pre-schooler\u2019s backpack. And he comes across the room and he proceeds to speak. And suddenly he turns the entire room of grovelling, curmudgeoned, angry men into howling schoolgirls.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt was just electrifying to see that kind of personality, change the complete energy of the room. So that\u2019s when I was like, \u2018who is this guy? I gotta go say hi\u2019. And I walked right over and I said, Mr Johnson, my name is Jennifer Arcuri. I would really love it if you\u2019d come speak at my venture capital event.\u201d\n\nJohnson went on to speak at four events run by Acuri\u2019s start-up company, Innotech, and she claims visited her Shoreditch flat up to 10 times. The pair also went on three EU-funded trade missions to Kuala Lumpur, New York and Tel Aviv.\n\nDuring the Kuala Lumpur trip in December 2014, Arcuri met Johnson\u2019s half brother Max, who was then based in Hong Kong for Goldman Sachs. She was pictured by the mayor\u2019s tech ambassador, Eileen Burbidge, with Johnson\u2019s younger brother alongside one of the mayor\u2019s deputies, Richard Blakeway, at the UK high commissioner\u2019s residence in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nEileen Burbidge (@eileentso) at high commissioner's residence in Kuala Lumpur, l to r @davisonandy, Rick Blakeway, @maxjohnson_27 @jennifer_arcuri pic.twitter.com/OO7L2niYzT\n\nA selfie by Arcuri at the same event showed her with Max Johnson and Gordon Innes, the then head of L&P.\n\nA letter from the prime minister\u2019s lawyers sent on Monday said that the London assembly\u2019s oversight committee had no right or remit to investigate his relationship with Arcuri.\n\nThe committee asked Johnson to explain how grants and privileged access to trade trips were awarded to Arcuri during his time as mayor.\n\nThe letter, which was leaked to HuffPost, said the oversight committee \u201cis not and should not be in effect a standards body\u201d and that \u201cthey may be exceeding their remit or overstepping the mark by requiring this information of our client\u201d.\n\nThe committee chair, Labour\u2019s Len Duvall, has asked for legal advice about whether the watchdog can discuss the letter at an open meeting next Wednesday.\n\nThe meeting is also expected to decide whether the committee should use its powers to summon the former mayor to answer questions in person, as it did over his failed garden bridge project.\n\nAllen Simpson, strategy and corporate affairs director at L&P, said: \u201cWe have received an information request from the IOPC and are complying with it in full. We will continue to do so.\u201d", "description": "Picture revealed as files relating to misconduct claims due to be handed to police watchdog", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1daf1c326f66a0fb73464bb89b5d531e36734802/362_65_2927_1756/master/2927.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e32a5982c420936150652c7be43eca4f", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
