Important questions remain about the British proposals. There is a lot of work to be done ahead of #EUCO on October 17/18. \u2014 Mark Rutte (@MinPres) October 5, 2019\n\nOfficials in Brussels have suggested the proposals may be part of Johnson\u2019s positioning for an election, as the U.K. prime minister continues to maintain the only options are his new proposal or a no-deal Brexit.\n\nLate on Friday, Johnson tweeted: \u201cNew deal or no deal - but no delay. #GetBrexitDone #LeaveOct31.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1180148038649700358?s=20\n\nThat\u2019s despite legislation passed by British MPs obliging the prime minister to apply to Brussels for an extension if no deal is reached by October 19.\n\nTalks between London and Brussels on Johnson\u2019s proposals are set to continue Monday, amid reports the EU rejected a request for discussions over the weekend.\n\nThe Guardian on Saturday quoted a senior EU diplomat as stating: \u201cIf we held talks at the weekend, it would look like these were proper negotiations. The truth is we\u2019re still a long way from that. We need to work out quickly whether there is the opportunity to close that gap.\u201d\n\nA European Commission spokeswoman said Friday: \u201cWe will meet again on Monday to give the UK another opportunity to present its proposals in detail,\u201d according to the Guardian. The spokeswoman said the proposals did not \u201cprovide a basis for concluding an agreement.\u201d", "description": "Dutch prime minister spoke with his UK counterpart on Saturday.", "authors": ["Thibault Larger"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/h_54798404-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
