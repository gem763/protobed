Former Bellator light heavyweight champion Davis handled Albrektsson for the majority of two rounds before he bullied and finished the Swede late in Round 3.\n\nThe first round was the closest of the three, but still was largely dominated by Davis. In the second round, \u201cMr. Wonderful\u201d dropped Albrektsson with a punch.\n\nDavis really took over in the third, big-brothering his opponent. After landing a series of vicious picks, Davis muscled Albrektsson to the ground against the cage. A series of punches and elbows followed. The strikes didn\u2019t stop raining down until referee Kevin MacDonald had seen enough and called off the fight at the 3:06 mark of Round 3.\n\nIn his post-fight interview, Davis made a plea to the Bellator brass to make a light heavyweight grand prix happen in the near future. The victory is Davis\u2019 fourth in his past five fights.\n\nBellator 231 was a first for Albrektsson. The Swedish light heavyweight made his promotional debut after winning his RIZIN debut in April. The loss to Davis snapped a three-fight win streak.\n\nThe light heavyweight bout was the Bellator 231 co-main event at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn. The main card aired on Paramount and streamed on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nUp-to-the-minute Bellator 231 results include:", "description": "The bout between Phil Davis and Karl Albrektsson served as the co-main event of Bellator 231 at Mohegan Sun Casino.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Matt Erickson", "Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/phil-davis-bellator-231.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
