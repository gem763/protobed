I\u2019m from the West. Out here, we ride for the brand.\u201d\n\nHe added that he and the president had lunch or a private Oval Office meeting every week both were in Washington, and \u201cwe had very open discussions.\u201d\n\nMr. Mattis, a former four-star Marine general, spoke as his new book, \u201cCall Sign Chaos,\u201d was about to be released. Until now, he has remained largely silent about his time in the administration, which he joined at its outset in 2017, as well as his decision in December 2018 to resign. He quit in part because of a disagreement with Mr. Trump about the president\u2019s desire to pull all American troops out of Syria, but also, as he made clear in a resignation letter, over ongoing disagreements about Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of America\u2019s allies.\n\nWhile Mr. Mattis was at the Pentagon, some Trump allies thought he slowed or blocked some of the actions the president wanted to take, including sending American soldiers to the Mexican border, withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and implementing a ban on transgender soldiers in the military.\n\nWithout discussing specific examples, Mr. Mattis denied trying to deflect the president\u2019s order. Instead, he said his approach was to \u201cgo in, do your best, give straight-up advice.\u201d In his book, he writes that he resigned when his \u201cconcrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with our allies, no longer resonated.\u201d\n\nMr. Mattis declined to discuss his specific assessments of Mr. Trump or his administration: \u201cI owe them a time of silence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re dealing with very, very difficult issues.\u201d Later, he added: \u201cSo while I\u2019ll talk about strategic issues, I\u2019m not here to speak ill of a sitting president.\u201d\n\nHe was frank, however, in discussing some of America\u2019s security challenges, and the political system that confronts them.\n\nHe had, for example, harsh words for Russia and its behavior. He noted that after the end of the Cold War, while a Marine commander, he participated in training for joint peacekeeping missions with Russian troops. \u201cThose days are long gone,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia with its invasion of Georgia, invasion of the Ukraine, has proven to be an authoritarian state that wants a veto authority over the nations along its periphery.\u201d\n\nOf China, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible for us to say that they would be authoritarians at home and somehow internationally they would be respectful of other people. You can\u2019t square that circle.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nHe also was critical of President Obama\u2019s attempt to withdraw American troops from Iraq, which he described as an example of \u201cpoor strategic decision-making.\u201d Mr. Mattis was in command of U.S. troops in the region at the time.\n\nMr. Obama \u201cunderstandably wanted to end that war,\u201d he said, but acted \u201cagainst military advice, against the intelligence community\u2019s advice. My point is that you may want a war over, you may even declare a war over, but the bottom line is the enemy gets a vote. And instead of ending that war, we in effect restarted it when we pulled our troops out of Iraq.\u201d\n\nWhile Defense secretary, Mr. Mattis also argued for keeping a robust American troop presence in Afghanistan, and he declined to estimate how long he thinks U.S. forces will need to remain in that country. The Trump administration is trying now to broker peace talks between the Afghan government and the Islamist forces of the Taliban movement.\n\nBut he said that terrorism will continue to be a threat until its \u201croot causes\u201d are eliminated. \u201cThis is simply something we\u2019re going to have to accept, as unpalatable as that is. It\u2019s going to take a while.\u201d\n\nWhile at the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis was part of an unusual governing alignment in which former generals held top civilian government posts; besides Mr. Mattis, John Kelly served as both secretary of Homeland Security and White House chief of staff, and H.R. McMaster as national security adviser. Mr. Mattis didn\u2019t venture a judgment on how that experiment worked out: \u201cI think that is something history will have to judge.\u201d\n\nWrite to Gerald F.
