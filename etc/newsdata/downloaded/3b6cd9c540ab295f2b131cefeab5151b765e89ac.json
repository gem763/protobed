Only Underground trains will run, and they will be suspended on Christmas Day along with all other rail services nationwide.\n\nGWR long-distance services to Exeter, Plymouth, Bristol, Cardiff and Swansea will start and end at Reading. South Western Railway will run extra services between Reading and London Waterloo.\n\nAfter 23 December, no Night Riviera sleeper trains will run between Paddington and Penzance for the rest of the year.\n\n\u201cServices will resume on Wednesday 1 January,\u201d says GWR.\n\nAlthough some Paddington services will start up on Saturday 28 December, only two of the four lines from the station will open due to track work between London and Reading.\n\nHeathrow Express and TfL Rail links to Britain\u2019s busiest airport will also be affected, with a reduced service from Saturday 28 December.\n\nProblems for travellers to and from South Wales will be exacerbated by the closure of the line west of the Severn Tunnel.\n\nThe main link between England and South Wales, through the tunnel, will close from the end of service on Christmas Eve through to Friday 3 January.\n\nWork will take place at various locations between Severn Tunnel Junction and Bridgend, west of Cardiff.\n\nBuses will replace trains between Bristol Parkway, Newport, Cardiff Central and Bridgend.\n\nSome Valley Line services will run through Cardiff Central, but CrossCountry links from Birmingham will be replaced by buses.\n\nKing's Cross and Northeast England\n\nOn the East Coast main line, the morning of Friday 27 December will bring disruption at a time when many passengers would plan to travel after a two-day shutdown.\n\nTrains will be disrupted up to lunchtime to and from the southern terminus, London King\u2019s Cross area, closing some lines on Friday morning. LNER, Grand Central and Hull Trains services will be cancelled or run with extended journey times.\n\nThameslink and Great Northern services will also be affected.\n\nNetwork Rail says: \u201cMajor upgrade work will take place, upgrading and simplifying the track layout around the station for the first time in 40 years.\n\n\u201cTwo new lines will also be added, increasing the number of services that can run to/from the station, as well as allowing for faster train services.\u201d\n\nSoutheast England\n\nThe High Speed One line from London St Pancras to Ashford in Kent and beyond will be closed from the last trains on Christmas Eve, re-opening on Sunday 29 December. Other, slower trains will continue.\n\nOn Greater Anglia, New Year\u2019s Day will be the worst affected. Track work at Colchester will sever the main line between London Liverpool Street and Norwich. There will also be disruption from 27 to 31 December.\n\nThe Stansted Express service will run on Boxing Day \u2013 when most UK rail services are suspended \u2013 but only to and from Tottenham Hale, on the Victoria Line of the London Underground.\n\nJourneys to and from Liverpool Street station will take longer between 27 and 29 December due to line closures at Bethnal Green in east London.\n\nSouthend and its airport will once again be disconnected by rail from London, due to the long-running work on overhead wires. Buses will replace trains between Shenfield and Southend Victoria, and also between Wickford and Southminster, from Friday 27 December to New Year\u2019s Day inclusive.\n\nScotland\n\nIn Scotland, services west and north from Edinburgh will be disrupted from the end of service on Christmas Eve to 29 December because of work at Haymarket station \u2013 the station serving the west side of the city centre.", "description": "Millions of rail passengers face disruption to journeys across Britain over Christmas and New Year as a result of engineering work.Many travellers to and from the capitals of England, Wales and Scotland will be adversely affected.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FmD1vYHsUwxa31taSFRTww--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/56dc8d9975fa4a707c3699382d7463ef", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
