Many criticised the film for glorifying misogyny and a man who is unapologetic about assaulting women. The conversation about the film\u2019s influence is once again dominating the headlines, because of the recent death of a woman who was shot dead by a man she rejected.\n\n\n\nNikita Sharma was gunned down by Ashwani Kashyap, who was a fan of the film. His social media pages, including Facebook and TikTok (where he had a sizeable following) were full of references to the Shahid Kapoor starrer.\n\nIn one of his last videos, he repeated the dialogue from the film: \"Jo mera nahi ho sakta, usse kisi aur ke hone ka mauka nahi doonga (Who is not mine will not be someone else\u2019s either).\u201d\n\nSandeep Reddy Vanga defends \u2018Kabir Singh\u2019 again\n\nSandeep gave an interview to Mid-Day where he once again defended the film by saying that it did not endorse murdering women.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for the girl and her family. It is unfortunate that people have lost their lives. As filmmakers, we are responsible for our craft and need to consider the repercussions, but never have my films [endorsed] killing anyone. Kabir Singh or even Arjun Reddy [the Telugu original] never [supported] murder,\" said the filmmaker, who had earlier said that the accusations of sexism will not affect his work.\n\n\u201cThe man in question seems to have some psychological issue. Such people often look up to Bollywood celebrities, sportspersons or politicians. If you see Shahid\u2019s character in the film, he is a self-destructive person who is harming himself more than anyone else,\u201d the filmmaker added.\n\nThis is not a sufficient response\n\nWhile filmmakers have the right to tell all kinds of stories, and bring flawed characters to the big screen, it is irresponsible to glorify an evil which is rampant in our society. The 2018 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) released by the Union health ministry, found that 31% of Indian women have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence at the hands of their partners. When a mainstream film starring big-name stars, normalises violence against women, it becomes part of the problem. Women like Nikita Sharma are part of the damage caused, and it\u2019s high time filmmakers like Sandeep Reddy Vanga and stars like Shahid Kapoor start making amends, instead of offering weak explanations.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Kabir Singh director Sandeep Reddy Vanga has responded to the death of a woman, whose murderer was reportedly inspired by the film.
