Lawmakers were allowed to see the complaint the evening before acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was set to testify to Congress about it.\n\nThe complaint is at least in part related to a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump prodded Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden. The White House released a rough transcript of that call Wednesday morning.\n\nHouse Democrats emerging from a secure room would not divulge details of the complaint, but described it as disturbing and urgent. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said it \u201cexposed serious wrongdoing\u201d and \u201ccertainly provides information for the committee to follow up with others.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Rep. Eric Swalwell told CNN that the whistleblower \u201claid out a lot of other documents and witnesses who were subjects in this matter.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers did not learn the identity of the whistleblower, according to one person familiar with the complaint who was granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nA Democratic member of the panel, Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, said the whistleblower \u201clays out the situation very logically\u201d and \u201cis both acknowledging the things that he or she knows and doesn\u2019t know, which is a hallmark of a credible document.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 who on Tuesday fully endorsed an impeachment investigation in light of the Ukraine revelations \u2014 and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also viewed the complaint. Schumer said he is even \u201cmore worried\u201d now than he was before reading it and \u201cthere are huge numbers of facts crying out for investigation.\u201d\n\nMost Republicans were quiet or defended the president as they left the secure rooms. But at least one Republican said he was concerned by what he had read.\n\n\u201cRepublicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there\u2019s no \u2018there there\u2019 when there\u2019s obviously a lot that\u2019s very troubling there,\u201d said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a GOP member of the Senate intelligence panel who has been an occasional critic of Trump. He added that \u201cDemocrats ought not be using words like \u2018impeach\u2019 before they knew anything about the actual substance.\u201d\n\nTrump, whose administration had earlier balked at turning over the complaint, said Wednesday afternoon that \u201cI fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information\u201d and that he had communicated that position to House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nThe rough transcript released by the White House on Wednesday showed that Trump prodded Zelenskiy to work with the U.S. attorney general and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nLawmakers said they needed to see the complaint, not just the memo about the call, as they investigate the president and whether his actions were inappropriate. Pelosi on Tuesday said that if Trump abused his presidential powers, it would mark a \u201cbetrayal of his oath of office.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if the complaint will eventually be made public. Both Republicans and Democrats have called for it to be released.", "description": "Democrats who reviewed a secret whistleblower complaint involving President Donald Trump Wednesday called it \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and said it gives them new...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS080_schiff_ZG_20190925210747.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
