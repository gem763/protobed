Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect $1.28 a share on revenue of $3.59 billion.\n\nTexas Instruments Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi blamed the outlook on ongoing trade uncertainties with China and customers holding back purchases.\n\n\u201cOur sense is that customers are just far more cautious than they were certainly a year ago, but even 90 days ago, and many of them talk about the caution,\u201d Lizardi said.\n\n\u201cThey mention the trade tensions that we know have been happening, and have been kind of accumulating over the last three or four quarters, and the consistency of that breadth of weakness supports that this is a macro situation that is driving the further weakness that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d the CFO told analysts.\n\nAnalysts, however, kept on pressing for more details of the outlook, and Lizardi addressed the frustration, stressing the weakness was broad-based.\n\n\u201cI can sense that you collectively are unsatisfied with our answers and I understand that,\u201d Lizardi told analysts. \u201cWe have close to 100,000 different customers and we still have about 100,000 different products. It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint any one thing.\u201d\n\nCustomers \u201cbecome more cautious and they pull back, and we are at the very end of a long supply chain, and when the ones at the very front pull back, it becomes a traffic jam,\u201d said Lizardi.\n\n\u201cSo our sense is that is what\u2019s happening in the marketplace, but we\u2019ll see what other companies will report over time and we\u2019ll get a clear picture over the next several weeks, and really quarters, because this thing, we\u2019ve been in it for now four quarters, and it\u2019s going to be longer than that,\u201d the CFO told analysts\n\nThe company reported third-quarter net income of $1.43 billion, or $1.49 a share, compared with $1.57 billion, or $1.58 a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue declined to $3.77 billion from $4.26 billion in the year-ago quarter, marking the fourth quarter in a row of declining revenue.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast earnings of $1.42 a share on revenue of $3.82 billion.\n\nShares of other chip companies also fell after hours. Intel Corp. INTC, -0.23% shares fell 2%, with the chip giant reporting earnings Thursday.\n\nON Semiconductor Corp. ON, -1.08% shares fell 4%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.20% shares declined 2.5%, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -1.62% slipped 1.8% and Micron Technology Inc. MU, -1.24% shares fell 2.2%.\n\nShares of Skyworks Solutions Inc.

AVGO, -0.73% shares fell 2.2%.\n\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, -0.77% closed down 0.8% Tuesday, and is up 39% for the year, compared with a nearly 20% rise in the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.36% and a 22% gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.72%.", "description": "Texas Instruments Inc. shares dropped in the extended session Tuesday after the chip-maker\u2019s outlook fell well beneath Wall Street estimates, and other...", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HC538_texasi_ZG_20190123182028.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
