The indictment will then be made public.\n\nGooding Jr., 51, was arrested in June after the woman, who has not been named, phoned police claiming that he grabbed her breast in front of his girlfriend while he was drunk at the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar in Manhattan.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. raises his eyebrows as he sits in court on Thursday.

He will return on October 15\n\nIt is unclear if the accuser will testify. Prosecutors are being tight-lipped about what evidence they plan to submit.\n\nGooding Jr.'s lawyer, Mark Heller, previously said the video footage will exonerate him.\n\nThey submitted a motion to dismiss the case earlier this year, claiming the woman - who they said had a 'troubled mentality'.\n\n'I frankly am shocked and horrified that this case is being prosecuted.\n\n'Mr Gooding has not acted inappropriately in any shape or form.'\n\nHeller claimed security videos would exonerate Gooding, adding: 'Nothing in the video could even be considered ambiguous and I am shocked and horrified that this case is being prosecuted.'\n\nThe case was due to begin in September but it was delayed at the request of prosecutors who said they needed more time to collect video evidence.\n\n", "description": "The 51-year-old actor was already charged with forcible touching and misdemeanor sexual abuse for allegedly groping a woman's breast at a nightclub in Manhattan in June", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19543422-0-image-a-51_1570719638751.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
