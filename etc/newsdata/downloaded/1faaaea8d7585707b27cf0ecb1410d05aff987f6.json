I think we both knew, without saying anything, that it would be difficult to hold on to my job.\n\nThe team had been poor. I\u2019d made some wrong decisions on team selection. The crowd hadn\u2019t been happy. I can\u2019t say I was surprised when, 45 minutes into the drive, the phone rang and I saw my boss\u2019s name flash up in the darkness.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had a chat with the owner and we think it\u2019s time to make a change,\u2019 he told me. It was a brief conversation. I didn\u2019t argue with him. The club have given me a go. They\u2019ve been fair and good to me.\n\nIt was an emotional call for me because I\u2019ve invested my life in Chesterfield and the job there in the last six months or so. But was there an element of relief when I put the phone down? Yes, in a way I think there probably was.\n\nWaking up at 4.30am, sometimes heading out with the dog in the dark country lanes to clear your mind, struggling to fill the 11 places in the team, feeling like you\u2019re putting square pegs in round holes.\n\nAllen believed he could turn results around after beating big-spending Salford in the league\n\nIt\u2019s not been the easiest of times, even though I\u2019d always believed that we could turn the corner, especially when we beat big-spending Salford a few weeks ago.\n\nYou need perspective in all things, especially when you\u2019re playing the casino wheel of football management. Just under two years ago I had a dodgy heart and wondered how I was going to live. But the small details of the past few days have been hard.\n\nWhen you\u2019re the manager, a sponsor can\u2019t get a car to you quickly enough. When you\u2019re no longer the manager, they want it back ASAP. We\u2019ve been renting a house near Melton Mowbray so we\u2019ve had to trigger the termination agreement.\n\nWe\u2019ve had to clean the house, organise removals, begin the process of ferrying stuff out. It helps that we\u2019d kept our house down south.\n\nI have had a lot of text messages from some of the people I\u2019ve come to know. Not just players. Staff at the club and some of the local journalists who I think I forged an understanding and a good, honest working relationship with.\n\nI\u2019ve had messages from other managers. Two younger managers have asked me in to watch their training and see if I might be able to help them in some way. Of course I want to help.\n\nBut I can\u2019t pretend that there isn\u2019t a sense of isolation at a time like this. For day after day, your phone never stops ringing or bleeping with messages.\n\nPlayers, colleagues, managers wanting to buy or sell players, journalists wanting stories.\n\nAllen joined the club in the summer on leaving Barnet following relegation from League Two\n\nThen suddenly, at a stroke, all of that stops. You\u2019re suddenly sitting on a sofa, trying to source a removals lorry, while you watch the results come in. I can\u2019t pretend that there isn\u2019t a feeling of deep isolation when you drop off the merry-go-round.\n\nThe brief time in Chesterfield has surprised me in many ways. For all the challenges, the club and its support base have been different to perhaps any other I\u2019ve known.\n\nIt\u2019s a tight-knit, hard-working industrial town where they love their football, tell it how it is and are very, very passionate about the team they\u2019ve been supporting for years.\n\nThe club\u2019s got stuck in a cycle of struggle, dropping two leagues in two seasons before this first season in non-League. Stabilising that kind of situation doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nThe fans deserve better. I find myself leaving the place as a Chesterfield fan. I will definitely return as a supporter one day and by that time I hope this corner will be turned for them.\n\nAllen will now take a month's break and go on holiday with his wife Lisa to relax and unwind\n\nThis year has reminded me how quickly things can turn in football. Everything that\u2019s happened at Chesterfield is down to me and nobody else. I chose the players and brought them in.\n\nYet it\u2019s hard to believe things have come to this after the amazing run we had at Barnet back in the spring, when I went back to the club as they looked doomed to relegation and helped them to such an incredible run that we just lost out on survival on the last day of the season.\n\nI\u2019ll take a one-month break now, starting with a week or so in the sunshine somewhere with Lisa. Then I\u2019ll be looking for another opportunity.\n\nIn the first instance, I guess it might be a relegation fight somewhere. But I\u2019ve got a taste for the other end of the table in management. I\u2019ve won two championship titles and know how incredible that feels. I want a third and I\u2019m still determined to get it.\n\nMartin Allen was talking to Ian Herbert", "description": "MARTIN ALLEN: We were just approaching the Leicester turn-off on the M1 on Boxing Day night when I received the call to say that it was over.", "authors": ["Martin Allen For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/30/21/7966430-0-image-a-35_1546207071579.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-30"}
