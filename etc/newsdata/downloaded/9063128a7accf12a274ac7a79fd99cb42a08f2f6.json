Now he \u2013 and hundreds of thousands of other residents \u2013 are confronting another dilemma: No homeowners' insurance.\n\n\"Our insurance companies are saying, 'We're done with you!'\" he said.\n\nLike many other residents, DuPell's home is located on the so-called \"interface\" between suburb and woodland, where California's dry brush and beetle-ravaged trees stand side-by-side with expensive homes worth an average of half a million dollars. Given this scenario, property-casualty insurance companies are refusing to insure more than 350,000 homeowners in 10 counties seen as vulnerable to fires, according to published reports.\n\n\"We are seeing an increasing trend across California where people at risk of wildfires are being non-renewed by their insurer,\" said state Insurance Commissioner Richard Lara in a statement.\n\n\"Holding us hostage\"\n\nAmong their concerns, consumer groups says, is that loss of coverage could create a domino effect of declining home values because it's impossible to obtain a mortgage without homeowners insurance. That could scare potential buyers, as well as make it tougher for current homeowners to refinance their properties.\n\n\"The insurers have to come up with a better response than simply canceling policies,' said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a San Francisco-based advocacy group. \"They are holding us hostage, because you have to buy their product.\"\n\nInsurance Commissioner Lara has been meeting with local leaders in the 10 counties affected by this and, by all accounts, getting an earful. Nearly a quarter of a million homes are located in the fire-ravaged areas.\n\nCalifornia wildfire forces Six Flags evacuation\n\nThe latest data from the California Department of Insurance shows that property-casualty coverage for homes and businesses was already becoming harder to find due to fire losses in 2015 and 2017. That pattern continued in 2018, when 10% of property owners lost coverage.\n\nBut that was only the prelude. Last year was the most devastating for fires in the state's history, with 103 lives lost and 2 million acres scorched. In other words, the 10% of non-renewals doesn't begin to measure what Lara calls \"the full impact \u2026 linked to the devastating 2018 fires.\" This is likely to be felt later in 2019 and well into the future.\n\nLara said that the situation for homeowners may get a lot worse because \"not being able to obtain insurance can create a domino effect,\" driving down home sales and starving local communities of property tax revenues. \"Without action \u2026 we could see communities unraveling,\" he warned.\n\nOne solution is to raise insurance rates, but rate increases take time to get approved. \"Insurers are now filing with the state for multiple rate hikes,\" Bach said. And it's more than likely they'll get huge increases.\n\n\"We paid out more than $26 billion in claims from the 2017 and 2018 wildfires,\" said Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California. \"With years of repeated wildfires, we're now facing 'a new normal.'\"\n\nAnd that new normal could mean a triple or quadruple increase in premiums. DuPell points out that his neighbor \u2013 ironically himself an insurance agent \u2013 saw his annual homeowner's insurance rate skyrocket from $1,200 to $4,000. And he could be one of the lucky ones.\n\nInsurance of last resort\n\nHomeowners who can't buy regular insurance wind up in California's \"FAIR\" plan, a last resort for purchasing property coverage. This plan is typically much more expensive than a traditional homeowner's policy and offers bare-bones coverage that doesn't normally include theft, wind, water or earthquake damage, Bach said. Between 2015 and 2018, there was a 177% increase in homeowners residing in the state's 10 \"high risk\" counties who were forced into the FAIR plan.\n\nIn the past, regular insurers told homeowners they could lower their premiums \u2013 or avoid going into the state's FAIR plan \u2013 by building a \"defensive dome\" around their properties. That involved clearing away brush, trees and bushes; moving lawn furniture; spraying fire retardant; and replacing cedar shake roofs and other burnable substances with non-flammable products.\n\nIrma Corona (R) comforts neighbor Gerryann Wulbern in front of the remains of Wulbern's home after the two returned for the first time since the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, U.S. November 22, 2018.

It's possible that Bach and others may advocate for a radical solution that's been used to pressure insurers in other states that threatened to bail out: Deny them the right to sell profitable auto insurance policies unless they retain homeowners' insurance policies.\n\nIn the interim, Bach suggests the following plan of action for California homeowners in regions impacted by fires:", "description": "Insurance companies are saying, \"We're done with you,\" one resident says, while others face soaring costs", "authors": ["Ed Leefeldt", "Ed Leefeldt Is An Award-Winning Investigative", "Business Journalist Who Has Worked For Reuters", "Bloomberg", "Dow Jones", "Contributed To The Wall Street Journal", "The New York Times.
