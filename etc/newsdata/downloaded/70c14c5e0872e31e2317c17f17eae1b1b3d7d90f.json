More than one in six people now holiday alone, according to an October 2018 ABTA report. But the industry has yet to fully embrace single travellers.\n\nExtra charges on hotel rooms and cruise cabins are common. On coach tours, for example, you could pay a hefty single supplement and then be given a worse room than customers who are travelling in a couple or who choose to share a twin room.\n\nTelegraph Travel expert Gill Charton explains that coach tour operators in the UK and Europe tend to use older resort hotels. In such establishments, solo travellers can find themselves in \u201cshoebox-sized single rooms tucked away in unfavourable corners of the hotel.\u201d Whereas, in newer hotels, single rooms tend to be small doubles or standard doubles with a full-sized bathroom.\n\nIt can be worth negotiating for a better room or rate when travelling alone. An ABTA spokesperson said that most hotel rooms and cruise ships have been designed based on double-occupancy as this is where demand has been. It said solo travellers should be aware of the following:\n\nHolidaymakers travelling alone will usually be given a discount on the price of a double room, but it might not be half the price of a shared room\n\nGet larger discounts by being flexible about travelling outside of peak periods when hotels and travel companies offer good deals on double rooms\n\nBook early to secure single rooms\n\nLook out for single supplements when it comes to package holidays Credit: Getty More\n\nABTA said that companies are doing more to cater to the needs of single travellers, including negotiating with hoteliers to provide more flexibility and lower rates wherever possible.\n\n\n\nMore companies are adding rooms, tours and trips for those holidaying solo. Cruise companies, meanwhile, are adding more solo cabins to ships and more itineraries to suit solo passengers, it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, previous research by Telegraph Travel has found that single travellers are still being let down by the travel industry. We conducted some spot research into the extra costs they face; focusing on holidays where single travellers are most likely to pay more, and how to avoid these charges.\n\nCoach tours: look out for companies using newer hotels\n\nAs of September 26, certain coach tours were found to charge single travellers almost as much as, or more than, a quarter of the full cost of the trip.\n\nCoachholidays.com, for example, listed a 16-day Wonders of Sicily and Sorrento tour departing on July 4, 2020 at \u00a31,871 per person. For single travellers wishing to have their own room single room, there was an added supplement of \u00a3534.\n\nShearings, which offers coach breaks in the UK and Europe, said that on its UK coach tours to Shearings-owned hotels the single-supplement is \u00a35 per night.\n\nA solo coach trip to Hadrian's Wall?
