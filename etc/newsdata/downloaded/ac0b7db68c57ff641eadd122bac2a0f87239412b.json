Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel agency, collapsed last week leaving more than half a million people stranded around the globe. Turkey's Tourism Ministry had said it was working with the Finance Ministry to extend a loan package to businesses affected by the collapse. The Advisory Council, including members of Turkey's tourism associations, said businesses should be offered a much bigger loan package than the government's planned 50 million euros - and that it should have long maturity terms, low interest rates and a grace period of three years. Smaller businesses should be prioritized while giving out loans, the council added.\n\nThomas Cook owes Turkey's tourism sector $381 million - council", "description": "Thomas Cook owes Turkey's tourism sector $381 million - council", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF902CS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
