The lab itself and its six occupants are safe and the need to replace the battery will not affect its scientific operations.\n\nNASA scheduled its first all-woman spacewalk last spring, but had to reschedule due to a shortage of medium-sized space suits, according to the AP.\n\n\u201cVery good that we have 4 expert spacewalkers on board to shoulder this tough task. They are the A-team!\u201d tweeted Anne McClain, who was originally scheduled to spacewalk with Koch in March before the suit-sizing issue.", "description": "NASA has pushed its planned first all-female spacewalk up at least three days, after a power system failure at the International Space Station,\u00a0according to The Associated Pres", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/nasa_042811getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
