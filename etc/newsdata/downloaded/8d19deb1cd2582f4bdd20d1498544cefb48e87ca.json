Brown\u2019s former trainer accused Brown of three incidents of rape and sexual assault.\n\nSince that initial accusation, more stories about Brown\u2019s behavior have emerged. A report from Sports Illustrated revealed another alleged instance of Brown engaging in sexual misconduct.\n\nThis allegation came from a woman Brown hired to paint his house. While the woman was working, Brown reportedly walked up to her naked, with only a small towel covering his genitals. Brown is also being sued by various people \u2014 including a doctor and trainer \u2014 for failing to pay for services.\n\nSome of Brown\u2019s apparel can still be found on Nike\u2019s website, according to the Globe. Brown\u2019s shoes, however, no longer appear on the company\u2019s website.\n\nThe NFL has launched an investigation into the allegations against Brown. The league met with the trainer who accused Brown of sexual assault Monday. On Wednesday, the Pittsburgh district attorney announced its office would not pursue charges against Brown due to a statute of limitations issue.\n\nDespite those allegations, Brown played during New England\u2019s Week 2 win over the Miami Dolphins. Brown caught four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown in that contest.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nStory continues\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
