They lost to newly-promoted Swiss Super League side Servette and Genoa in the first two games.\n\nThere were issues with Sylvinho's instructions. The full backs were told not to advance over halfway.\n\nWingers Memphis Depay and Bertrand Traore were told to come inside, which wasted striker Moussa Dembele, given he is a player who can get onto the end of crosses and finish off chances. Without full backs supporting Depay and Traore on the flanks, there was not enough attacking thrust.\n\nThe way the team was set up did not seem designed to get the best out of Dembele\n\nSylvinho had his full backs operate in a conservative way, which is not acceptable at Lyon\n\nFor a club that demands a forward-thinking approach on the back of their success in the 2000s, it was never going to go down well.\n\nBy the time they went to Arsenal and won, doubts were already creeping in. As one French source told Sportsmail, that Emirates Cup win was seen behind the scenes as 'the tree that hides the forest'.\n\nIt was followed by heavy losses against Liverpool and Bournemouth.\n\nWhen they lined up for their first game of the season, the basis of a good team was there. Depay and Dembele, with Traore alongside them in a 4-3-3, the sort of forwards the majority of Ligue 1 would envy.\n\nThey did win the Emirates Cup, but there was a sense that they were papering over the cracks\n\nCesc Fabregas was sent off early doors for Monaco and Lyon were rampant, winning 3-0.\n\nTheir second match against Angers went even better. Houssem Aouar, the next prospect from the academy, began the scoring and Dembele and Depay bagged a brace each to give them a 6-0 win.\n\nThat partnership of Dembele and Depay had six goals between them and they were top of the table. It was, in retrospect, the pride before the fall.\n\nThe start had matched what president Jean-Michel Aulas had wanted from this campaign. Finally, he thought, he had a team to make Lyon champions again and wrest the crown from PSG.\n\nDepay and Dembele started well as part of a front three, scoring six in their first two games\n\nBut a fluke loss to Montpellier changed things. Sylvinho clearly panicked at a 1-0 defeat defined by a wonder-strike.\n\nHe dropped Dembele, at that stage top scorer. Depay moved to centre forward, a position he has rarely played in his career. Sylvinho had clearly decided that the pair would not play together, despite the success of the opening two games.\n\nDraws with Bordeaux and Amiens followed. They then lost to PSG, drew with Brest, lost to Nantes and, finally, suffered a derby defeat against Saint-Etienne.\n\nThe only positive of that run was a 2-0 win against RB Leipzig in the Champions League, although they were also held to a draw in that competition by Zenit St Petersburg.\n\nBut a loss to Montpellier, courtesy of a fluke strike, saw Sylvinho change his outlook\n\nReally, the key issue comes back to that decision to drop one of Depay or Dembele for every game Lyon played.\n\nSportsmail understands Sylvinho did not manage the situation well, with neither particularly happy at the level of rotation they had to deal with. There was little justification in the choice either.\n\nThe Brazilian, who as previously an assistant manager to Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan and then working with his country of birth, is not thought to have explained the decision to either in a way that settled them down.\n\nDepay was keen to play centrally, but there is a sense that a stronger manager would have sacrificed the former Manchester United winger's desire for the benefit of the team at large.\n\nHe would only select one of Depay and Dembele up front, which was a problem for both\n\nThe pair started the clash with PSG in mid-September but Lyon went down 1-0 at home\n\nThe mentality of how the team set up was also a problem. Lyon fans would not accept a team that did not take the game to the opponents, and neither did the public at large.\n\nWhen drawing with recently promoted Brest, Sylvinho took Dembele off to bring Depay on rather than playing them together. He also subbed Jeff Reine-Adelaide off for a defensive midfielder, which caused frustration.\n\nThe biggest problem though, was what impact Sylvinho's chopping and changing was having on how Aulas likes to run Lyon. Or at least, how he usually does, given Sylvinho was an appointment made by sporting director and compatriot Juninho in the first-ever hands-off approach to bringing a coach in from the 70-year-old.\n\nAulas has long had success signing potentially talented players for cheap and selling them to Europe's leading lights for huge fees. For example, they signed Ferland Mendy in 2017 for \u20ac6million (\u00a35.3m) and sold him in June this year for \u20ac53m (\u00a346.9m) to Real Madrid.\n\nJean Michel-Aulas saw the values of some of his star players diminishing before his eyes\n\nJuninho was a hero to the Lyon fans as a player but he is under intense pressure\n\nWhen it comes to the current crop, the plans are the same. The hope with Dembele, bought for \u00a319.7m from Celtic, is that he can fire Lyon to trophies, establish himself with France and then move on at the right time for the right price.\n\nIt should work. Manchester United have been keeping an eye on him but it reached farcical levels on Sunday night when they sent a scout to watch him against Saint-Etienne only for him to start the game on the bench.\n\nHis price was dropping before Aulas' eyes.\n\nAouar, the big thing from the academy and viewed as the successor to Nabil Fekir, has also not been impressing in Sylvinho's system. That will not alert any of the teams sniffing around the Parc Olympique Lyonnais.\n\nManchester United have sent scouts to watch Dembele, only to see him dropped to the bench\n\nAulas was never likely to rest on that for long and that played a big part in his decision to let Sylvinho go. Not that he was Aulas' man \u2013 Juninho made the call.\n\nJuninho has been under fire for his decision making. He had little impact in the transfer market and his first appointment as manager has lasted just 11 competitive games \u2014 the lowest total for a coach ever.\n\nSylvinho's reign is also the first time a manager has lasted less than a full season at Lyon since 1988, the start of Aulas' second year as president.\n\nIt is notable now that the names being linked to the post \u2014 Arsene Wenger and Laurent Blanc \u2014 are Aulas' targets, not Juninho's.\n\nArsene Wenger and Laurent Blanc are the two men who have been linked with the job\n\nThey are tried and tested and while neither would be expected to catch up with PSG, who are 12 points ahead, they represent fairly certain options that will stabilise and move the team forward.\n\nNeither are anywhere near as green as Sylvinho.\n\nAnd when your rivals are Saint-Etienne, this might be a lesson for Lyon when it comes to managerial appointments going forward \u2014 it's worth avoiding Les Verts.", "description": "AMITAI WINEHOUSE: It is easy to forget that Lyon were Paris Saint-Germain without the billions within the last 15 years.
