Sports, the arts, music, science, education, the media, business.\n\nIt\u2019s a can-do city that has always had a certain entrepreneurial spirit, a robust confidence, a self-assured swagger.\n\nThose are characteristics held in high esteem by traditional Tories. In fact, they\u2019d like to claim a monopoly on them if they could.\n\nHowever, those attributes run through the DNA of a place that is fiercely loyal to Labour. This is partly because the city cares deeply about the pockets of poverty on its streets, knows that they have been exacerbated by the Tories\u2019 austerity, and would like to see them tackled.\n\nThe council is no longer a one party state, as it was a few short years ago, but there are still just four opposition members. In none of the other northern metropolises is Labour\u2019s dominance so complete.\n\nThis year\u2019s curtailed Tory conference will see a party frantically trying to hold itself together as Brexit tears it apart, and when we look at Manchester\u2019s history, there lies another grand issue that threatened the same. The city was the birthplace of the Manchester Liberals, who extolled the virtues of free trade and campaigned against the protectionist corn laws that kept food prices artificially high to the benefit of Tory farmers.\n\nThe city\u2019s famous adoptive son Richard Cobden, was one of the leaders of that movement, and also signed the first modern free trade agreement, the Cobden-Chevalier treaty, with France.\n\nThe irony is clear. Boris Johnson will be the star turn of a gathering of people who fetishise \u201cfree trade\u201d and yet want to drag Britain out of the biggest free trade zone the world has ever seen. Instead, his government seems determined to throw up walls with its biggest trading partner.\n\nCobden must be turning in his grave.\n\nManchester hasn't hosted the Tories with unchecked enthusiasm. The protests against it have been loud and passionate and on Johnson\u2019s watch the party has morphed into something still more deserving of them.\n\nThe party that called itself \u201cconservative\u201d has died. In its place is something much worse: a nationalist cult in thrall to a prancing bully who flirts with, and frequently crosses into the fetid swamp of the extreme right. A leader who is willing to flippantly dismiss the threats and intimidation experienced by colleagues, threats which sometimes quote him directly.\n\nThis flawed and spoiled man\u2019s latest performance in the House of Commons was grotesque. But no less foul was the baying mob behind him. He maintains his position in part because he is surrounded by a corps of enablers who have no more shame than he has.\n\nManchester may yet witness worse from him, new lows as he seeks to fire up the radicalised pensioners who form the bedrock of his support and will hang on his every rotten word.\n\nThe city is famous for the downpours that lash in from the Atlantic. Not for nothing does it call itself \u201cthe rainy city\u201d.\n\nIt will need a deluge for the ages to clean away the poison that Johnson and his friends will pour forth for however many days they manage to cobble together.\n\nAs he tried to head off today\u2019s latest revolt by MPs, Johnson claimed the conference was important to the city\u2019s economy. I think it would happily manage without his dirty money.\n\nNo doubt the good, liberal and true protestors of this great northern powerhouse will gather in numbers to give voice to that.", "description": "You have to feel for Manchester.
