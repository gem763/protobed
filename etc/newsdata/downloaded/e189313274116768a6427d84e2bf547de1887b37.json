By more or less tricking the game into thinking all players are in the same room, it\u2019ll let you remotely play with your friends generally local-only multiplayer games.\n\nValve published on its developers-only Steamworks site a note about the upcoming feature, first noticed by PCGamer. The note quickly made its way to the Unity developer forums.\n\n\u201cYour local multiplayer games will soon be improved with automatic support for Remote Play Together on Steam,\u201d it reads. \u201cAll local multiplayer, local co-op, and split-screen games will be automatically included in the Remote Play Together beta, which we plan to launch the week of October 21.\u201d\n\nThe pending launch was later confirmed by Valve\u2019s Alden Kroll:\n\nToday our team announced another great new platform feature that will be built into Steam: Remote Play Together. This will allow friends to play local co-op games together over the internet as though they were in the same room together. https://t.co/jEZyGoXEfc \u2014 Alden Kroll @ PAX Australia (@aldenkroll) October 10, 2019\n\nSo how does it work? If you\u2019ve ever used PS4\u2019s remote play (which lets you push PS4 games to your smartphone) or cast a game from your PC to an Nvidia SHIELD, it\u2019s a bit like that\u2026 just tweaked for multiplayer. One player hosts the game on their computer; Steam sends a stream of the visuals to everyone else, capturing controller/keyboard input and sending it back to player one. As far as the game knows, everyone is sitting around the same screen.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, of course, that some games will almost certainly fare better than others here. While streaming tech is only getting better, it inherently introduces latency \u2014 and in plenty of games, latency kills. Hopefully Valve makes it clear to players that this is all pretty unofficial; if a game isn\u2019t playable because of latency or anything else remote play brings into the mix, it\u2019s not really the developer\u2019s fault. Valve says developers can opt out of the beta feature if they see fit.\n\nValve says Remote Play Together will officially support up to four players in one game, and notes that the experience will only be as good as the connections of everyone involved.", "description": "Co-op video games are wonderful.
