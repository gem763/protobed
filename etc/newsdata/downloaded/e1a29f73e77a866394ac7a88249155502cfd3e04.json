Now if only more Democrats could have the courage to see that truth as well.\n\n\u201cWhat does it say that Fox News is nicer to me than the lefties are? What does it say that the conservatives are nicer to me? \u2026 It\u2019s such a bizarre world,\u201d Williams said, as Mediaite noted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the left was as mean as the right \u2014 they are.\u201d\n\nShe also chastised the \u201ccondescending attitudes\u201d of the left toward people of faith.\n\nOnce upon a time, politics in this country wasn\u2019t about hatred of the opposing party, but about shared love of country with disagreements on how to express that love in the political world.\n\nDemocrats put country first, partisanship second \u2014 at least, most of them did. John F. Kennedy had a love of America. He didn\u2019t deny America\u2019s greatness. He didn\u2019t use his political platform to purposely shatter the Constitution, hush opposing views, destroy conservatives.\n\nToday\u2019s Democrats?\n\nThey\u2019re the party of anger, hate, resistance, intolerance.\n\nThey detest President Donald Trump; deny any good he\u2019s done for this country.\n\nThey\u2019re disgusted with the American citizens who support Trump, to the point of wishing them violence.\n\nThey abhor the Constitution, in its intended form of limited governance, and want nothing more than to completely kill its spirit of rugged individualism and replace it with the collectivism of socialism.\n\nAnd they actively use and exploit the media and public schools and courts and political offices for their purposes of propaganda and destruction.\n\nWilliamson, part of that system, has now had a taste of what that system breeds. And she doesn\u2019t like it. A-ha, Ms. Williamson. Congratulations on the removal of blinders. Welcome to the world of uncomfortable truths.\n\nNow go forth and spread the word.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
