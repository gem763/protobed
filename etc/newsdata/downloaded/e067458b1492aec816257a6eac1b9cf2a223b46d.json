The government had said it would go ahead with its plan by the end this week, and on Monday gave the day and time of the exhumation.\n\nThe late dictator's family will attend the removal of his remains from the monument's central basilica at 1030 (0830 GMT) on Thursday, the government said in a statement.\n\nHe will be buried alongside his wife in the Mingorrubio El Pardo cemetery north of Madrid.\n\nThe Valley of the Fallen mausoleum holds the bodies of 34,000 Spaniards who died during the war, including many from the losing Republican side whose bodies were moved there during Franco's rule without the permission of their families.\n\nNeither media nor the general public will be allowed to watch the proceedings, in preparation of which the government shut the Valley of the Fallen.\n\nThe location of Franco's tomb continues to fracture Spanish opinion with 43% in favour of the move and 32.5% against, according to a poll published by El Mundo last week.\n\nSpain is facing its fourth election in four years in November and moving Franco's remains from the state mausoleum had long been a Socialist pledge.
