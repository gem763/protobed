The #FridaysforFuture school strikes are arguably the most dedicated and sustained direct action in a generation. School pupils have kicked off an international movement committed to addressing the injustices, mass extinctions and environmental damage caused by climate change \u2013 while also building global networks, speaking out in public and holding the adults around them to account.\n\nAs more adults and institutions join the protests, it seems the agency of these young people is finally being recognised. But conversations about climate change still appeal to authorities for answers \u2013 whether calling for politicians to act, or for people to listen to scientists.\n\nOf course, listening to experts and holding politicians to account is an important part of what climate activists need to achieve. But it\u2019s not the only part. As the schools strikes continue to gain momentum, it\u2019s time to think about how young people can be meaningfully involved in shaping the future of our planet.\n\nUnfortunately, there are still significant barriers preventing children from making their voices heard in democratic societies \u2013 not least the way they are represented in the media. As academics interested in children in politics and culture, we\u2019re exploring these issues as part of a project called Europe and the Child - Crisis, Activism, Culture. So far, we\u2019ve found that cultural images of children involved in activism reveal adult desires and anxieties, rather than providing real empowerment.\n\nAre you listening?\n\nSwedish activist Greta Thunberg captured the world\u2019s attention when she was invited to address world leaders at the UN conference on climate change in December 2018, at just 15 years of age. Since then, her school strikes have become a global phenomenon. Through international media coverage and meetings with high-profile political figures, Thunberg has brought the climate emergency into view, right at the heart of political power in the West.\n\nThunberg has explained that her actions were inspired by by the Parkland students\u2019 protests against gun violence, while the school strike model builds on the walkouts and sit-ins by African-American students during the civil rights era.\n\nThunberg is not the first young person to address the UN climate conference. Kathy Jenil-Kijiner, a Marshall Islands poet and activist, has called for urgent action as rising sea levels threaten her home, as has young diplomat Yeb Sano from the Philippines. Global climate injustice cannot be fully understood without listening to, and empowering, young people from around the world.\n\nThunberg\u2019s role as spokesperson for the younger generation is fraught with difficulties. As a child herself, Thunberg has insisted that the blame for the current climate emergency \u2013 and the responsibility for fixing it \u2013lies with older generations. Yet adults and establishment figures have repeatedly sought to position her either as a prophet and a child saviour, or as a naive puppet of interested parties.\n\nFor example, writer and activist Naomi Klein praised Thunberg for her moral clarity, arguing that she is one of the youth voices that has \u201cburst through the bureaucratic language with which we shield ourselves from the reality of the stakes, the extraordinary stakes of our moment in history\u201d, and that young people have found a sense of agency in Thunberg\u2019s school strikes, and her insistence that no one is too small to make a difference.", "description": "From media coverage to story books, children are consistently represented as prophets or puppets in the midst of climate emergency.
