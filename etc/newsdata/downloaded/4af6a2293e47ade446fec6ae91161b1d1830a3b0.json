The agency sent up a second medium spacesuit in October.\n\nNasa unveils spacesuits to be worn by first woman on the moon Read more\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important because of the historical nature of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Koch said ahead of the spacewalk. \u201cIn the past, women haven\u2019t always been at the table. It\u2019s wonderful to be contributing to the space program at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role. That can lead in turn to increased chance for success.\u201d\n\nKoch, who has been on the ISS since March, was first out the hatch, followed by Meir, carrying a tool bag. During the five-and-a-half-hour spacewalk, the astronauts remained attached to handrails on the exterior of the ISS using harnesses and pairs of metal carabiners. These are sequentially clipped and unclipped to ensure that the astronauts cannot float off into space.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christina Koch and Jessica Meir step out of the ISS in a still image taken from Nasa video on 18 October.

Researchers are collecting extensive biomedical data on the impact of spaceflight on Koch\u2019s body.\n\nThe majority of data available is on male astronauts, but there is some evidence that there are sex differences in responses to a space environment. One study found that women are more likely than men to experience faintness as a result of \u201corthostatic hypotension\u201d, a cardiovascular issue. Men appear more prone to vision changes caused by spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (Sans).\n\nPreviously, 14 women and 213 men have carried out spacewalks. The first woman was the Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who went outside the USSR\u2019s Salyut 7 space station in 1984.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nasa unveiled the prototype for a new spacesuit that could be worn by the next crew, expected to include a woman, to land on the moon. The suit is designed to give a customised fit to the individual astronaut, whatever their shape or size.\n\n\ufeff", "description": "Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, tasked with replacing faulty device at International Space Station, embarked on \u2018historic\u2019 effort", "authors": ["Hannah Devlin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5c3dd3a118c354d7989642f2a6b5108924d82fd/242_0_3258_1956/master/3258.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9e18e29b94258e0ad391aac4d7199938", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
