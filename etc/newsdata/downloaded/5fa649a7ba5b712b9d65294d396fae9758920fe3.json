REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nLawmakers opposed to the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union on Oct. 31 without an orderly transition arrangement are drawing up plans to try to legislate to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to rule out a no-deal exit.\n\nJohnson has said his efforts to strike a new withdrawal agreement with the EU would be hampered by any attempt in Westminster to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHe has limited lawmakers\u2019 flexibility by suspending parliament for about a month before the Brexit deadline, and if they do pass legislation, senior minister Michael Gove on Sunday refused to guarantee it would be heeded.\n\nCorbyn will say Johnson\u2019s move to shut down parliament is \u201can attack on democracy which will be resisted\u201d, according to excerpts of a speech he will make in Salford, north England.\n\n\u201c(On Monday) the shadow cabinet will be meeting to finalise our plans to stop the disaster of No Deal ahead of the return of parliament (on Tuesday),\u201d he will say, referring to a meeting of senior Labour figures.\n\n\u201cWe are working with other parties to do everything necessary to pull our country back from the brink.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Gavin Williamson backs threat to deselect rebel Conservative lawmakers\n\nJohnson told the Sunday Times that the choice for lawmakers was either to side with Corbyn, who \u201cwanted to scrub the democratic verdict of the people - and plunge this country into chaos\u201d, or with those who \u201cwanted to get on with it\u201d.\n\nCorbyn, however, will say the battle to stop a no-deal Brexit is not a struggle between those who want to leave the EU and those who want to stay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a battle of the many against the few who are hijacking the referendum result to shift even more power and wealth towards those at the top,\u201d he will say.\n\nLabour said the threat of a no-deal Brexit was adding to what it said was the damage already done to industry by nine years of Conservative government.\n\nThe government said Corbyn was only offering \u201cmore delay and uncertainty\u201d.\n\n\u201cOnly Boris Johnson and the Conservatives can provide the leadership Britain needs, leave the EU by 31 October, whatever the circumstances, and deliver the change British people voted for,\u201d said Conservative deputy chairman Paul Scully.\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said on Sunday the party\u2019s plan, which will be published on Tuesday, had one \u201cvery simple\u201d aim: to stop Johnson taking Britain out of the EU without a deal, if necessary by forcing him to extend the Brexit deadline again.\n\nBritain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks during an anti-Brexit demonstration at George Square in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, August 31, 2019.
