Narita.\u201d\n\nLocated just a 15-minute drive away from Narita Airport\u2019s Terminal 2, Ready to Flight! Narita is perfectly placed to accommodate travelers looking for somewhere to stay near the airport. And according to Lion Real Estate, the Tokyo-based property management company behind the renovation, travelers who stay here will be able to immerse themselves in the nostalgia of a Japanese school environment while also experiencing both the history and the future of Narita City.\n\nInside, a number of old classrooms have been preserved for visitors to enjoy as public spaces to walk through or relax in. Old fixtures like shoeboxes have also been repurposed into new furnishings and design pieces, to highlight the fact that everything old can be new again.\n\nThe school is well equipped with a variety of different rooms to accommodate not only individual guests, but large groups as well. In addition to having a large gymnasium and a music room (which can be privately used at a cost of 3,000 yen per hour), the complex also has a tatami room, a rooftop area with views of the night sky, and a cafe and bar area, where prices for drinks and snacks start at 300 yen.\n\n\u25bc There\u2019s also a kitchen and library space that\u2019s free for guests to use.\n\nGuests can choose to sleep on futons in a dormitory style room for 3,000 yen or a private room for 4,000 yen per person per night. Shower and toilet facilities are shared, and guests can check from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m., with later check-ins available with prior notice.\n\nThe new lodging aims to be \u201can inn where you can prepare for a journey\u201d, with an airport shuttle service and plenty of room for your luggage, and a place where you can \u201cdiscover a new you\u201d, with a variety of activities on offer, including camping events on the grounds.\n\nDespite opening to the public on 1 October, Ready to Flight! Narita will have its \u201cgrand opening ceremony\u201d from 11:00 a.m. on 14 October, with the Mayor of Narita and Narita City Council members in attendance. It\u2019s clear that the local council is keen to support the rejuvenation of the school buildings and the neighborhood around it, and we can too, by making a booking online to go back to school.\n\nIt\u2019s a great way to support the local community and experience the charm of everyday Japanese life, even on a budget.
