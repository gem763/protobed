He was the main architect behind India's dominance in the sport during the late 1920s and 1920s.\n\nHe was known as the magician who could make his hockey stick a magnet that attracted the ball and made it dance to his tunes. In a career spanning over 20 years, Dhyan Chand made the world fall in love with hockey, and mastered the game to make it his own.\n\nWho was Dhyan Chand?\n\nBorn in Allahabad, Dhyan Chand joined the army at a very young age and would later on making his name in the game of hockey. His mesmerising skills and wizardry with the hockey stick made him the household not only in India, but around the world, too.\n\nEarly Life\n\nIndia's greatest hockey player Dhyan Chand (born Dhyan Singh) was born on August 29, 1905, in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nPTI\n\nDhyan Chand's father worked in the British Indian Army, and he played hockey for the army. Dhyan Chand had two brothers \u2013 Mool Singh and Roop Singh. Chand had to migrate a lot early on in his life, because of his father's numerous army transfers, and they were on the move so much so that he had to terminate his education after only six years of schooling.\n\nDon't Miss\n\nThe family finally settled down in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh. When he was young, Dhyan Chand had no interest in hockey, but he had a inclination towards wrestling. He used to sometimes play hockey with his friends, but that as about it.\n\nEarly Career\n\nOn his 17th birthday in 1922, Dhyan Chand joined 1st Brahmans of the British Indian Army. It was only after he joined the army that Chand's interest in hockey began to grow drastically. Chand exclusively played army hockey tournaments and regimental games. Chand was ultimately selected for the Indian Army team which was to tour New Zealand.\n\nThe team that made their journey to New Zealand showed great grit, determination, and played some sizzling hockey to garner praise form all around. The team went on to win 18 matches, drawing 2 and losing only 1. Though, there are no official record of the same, but it is said team including Dhyan Chand were giving a rousing applause during the tour.\n\nAfter the team returned from the New Zealand, Chand was promoted to Lance Naik in 1927.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAfter successfully lobbying for reintroducing field hockey in the Olympics, the newly formed Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) made preparations to send its best possible team for the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. Three years before the mega event, an Inter-Provincial Tournament was held to select the team members.\n\nThe team consisted of five teams - United Provinces (UP), Punjab, Bengal, Rajputana and Central Provinces. Dhyan Chand was given the permission by his regiment to play for the United Provinces team. The United Provinces started the tournament with Chand as their centre-forward and Marthins playing inside-right.\n\nIt turned out to be a be a fruitful partnership as the duo terrorised their opponents with trickery and fast passing moves. The understanding between the two blossomed and each attacking play saw them on the wavelength. The IHF assembled the final squad in Bombay that included Dhyan Chand and Center-half Broome Eric Pinniger as the captain.\n\nCome 1928, Indian team made their way to Netherlands. After having performed very well in the exhibition tournaments prior to the Olympics, the team was buoyant and confident of doing well. And it was also the time when Dhyan Chand really came to life. The same Dhyan Chand who would go on to mesmerise and craft his way to being one of the greatest players to ever grace the game of hockey. .\n\nIt was a start of something truly special - a reign that would see Indian team absolutely dominate the hockey circuit for decades to come.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn the first game India team hammered Austria 6-0, with the masterful tactician Dhyan Chand scoring 4 of those goals. It was the shadow of things to come as in the next three matches India scored 20 goals to enter the final.\n\nIndia came into the final as hot favourites, and with Dhyan Chand fascinating with his skills and setting the stage alight, it was a tailor made occasion for him and team India to set a marker and create history. The final was not going to be easy and with Netherlands impressing as well in the games prior to the final, it was a mouthwatering contest that could have gone either way.\n\nBut with Chand on song, he was always going to be the difference. His trickery and surreal ability was too hot to handle for the host Netherlands, his two goals giving India a 3-1 win to seal a historic gold medal. Chand finished with a goal tally of 14.\n\nIt was the making of Dhyan Chand and in the next few years he would go on to become the most revered player. Dhyan Chand with a hockey stick was a treat to the eyes. In 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, India went on to repeat the heroics of 1928 by winning the gold. Chand again was the star of the show scoring a ridiculous 12 goals, that include 8 in the game against USA which India won 24-1.\n\n1936 Berlin Olympics and Final Years\n\nAs destiny would have it, the Berlin Games was to be Dhyan Chand\u2019s third and last Olympics at the age of 31, for he had decided to retire. Undoubtedly at the peak of his prowess, he was handed the Indian team\u2019s captaincy.\n\nIndia won all their three league matches and hammered France 10-0 in the semifinals and Germany 8-1 in the gold medal match. Dhyan Chand established himself as the greatest hockey player of the time and ended the Berlin Olympics on a high with a tally of 11 goals.\n\nAfter retirement, he taught at coaching camps at Mount Abu, Rajasthan. Later, he accepted the position of Chief Hockey Coach at the National Institute of Sports, Patiala, a post he held for several years. Chand spent his last days in his hometown of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\nChand died on 3 December 1979 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. He was cremated at the Jhansi Heroes ground in his hometown, after some initial problems in getting clearance. His regiment, the Punjab Regiment, accorded him full military honours.", "description": "Dhyan Chand was an Indian hockey player and often regarded as one of the greatest hockey players in history.
