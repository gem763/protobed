CBD 'boost effectiveness of the drugs'", "language": "en", "text": "It's said to fight off anxiety, muscle aches and insomnia - but now a study suggests CBD oil may also hold the key to fighting superbugs.\n\nResearchers have found the trendy health supplement can strip away the ability of bacteria to resist being killed by antibiotics.\n\nBacteria release tiny compounds which help them transport nutrients and build up a defence to medications.\n\nBut CBD oil \u2013 part of a booming market in the UK and US \u2013 was shown to prevent E. Coli from producing the so-called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs).\n\nThis boosted the ability of antibiotics to kill off the bacteria and stop them from multiplying, the University of Westminster researchers claim.\n\nCBD has long been believed to have anti-bacterial properties, but it was not clear how this mechanism worked.\n\nNow scientists believe by inhibiting the production of OMVs, it breaks down bacteria's defence and allows the body to fight it off. But experts say trials in humans are now needed to investigate further.\n\nCBD oil may hold the key to combating superbugs because it blocks bacteria from producing a key compound (stock)\n\nThe study found one micrometre of cannabis oil reduced the production of so-called OMVs by an average of 73 per cent and five micrometres by 53 per cent. CDB's effect on staphylococcus aureus, though, was minimal\n\nHealth bosses have repeatedly warned antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the biggest threat to modern medicine.\n\nBacteria learn to adapt and become drug resistant when people take incorrect doses of antibiotics or if they are given out unnecessarily.\n\nThe problem is propelled by the fact that no new antibiotics have been developed in decades.\n\nAround 700,000 people already die yearly due to drug-resistant infections including tuberculosis (TB), HIV and malaria across the world.\n\nPublic Health England says around 5,000 in England die due to superbugs every year.\n\nResearchers led by Dr Sigrun Lange, a senior lecturer in molecular pathology, grew E. Coli in a laboratory and treated the bacteria with antibiotics.\n\nThey applied one micrometre of cannabidiol to the bacteria and assessed what effect it had after an hour.\n\nThey then did the same with a higher dose, five micrometres, of CBD oil.\n\nThe five antibiotics used were erythromycin, vancomycin, rifampicin, kanamycin and colistin - all of which are used to treat bacterial infections.\n\nThe lesser dose of CBD oil reduced the production of OMVs by an average of 73 per cent, while the stronger amount brought the number down by 54 per cent.\n\nIn some cases, E. Coli has been able to adapt and resist vancomycin - also used to treat skin and blood infections, meningitis and bone and joint infections.\n\nBut in this study, the CBD oil was shown to prevent the bacteria from defending itself against the drug.\n\nDr Lange said: 'The antibacterial properties of cannabis oil have been known for some time, but no one knew how it worked.\n\nShe said that previous research suggested CBD oil was a 'potent' regulator of OMVs.\n\nDr Lange added: 'We have now demonstrated that cannabis oil is very effective at increasing antibiotic effects through changes in membrane vesicle composition and release in bacteria.\n\nWHAT IS CBD OIL AND IS IT LEGAL IN THE UK? CBD oil is a legal cannabinoid that can be sold in the UK. CBD contains less than 0.2 per cent of the psychoactive substance THC. Although the oil has been thought to have some medicinal properties, including relieving inflammation, pain and anxiety, there is no conclusive science. Suppliers in England and Wales have to obtain a licence to sell CBD as a medicine. Manufacturers are able to avoid the strict regulation by selling it as a food supplement - ignoring the lengthy process of gaining a medicinal licence. CBD products comes in many forms, the most popular being an oil - which users spray under their tongue - or gel tablets which melt slowly in the mouth. Government advisers at the MHRA found that CBD has a \u2018restoring, correcting or modifying\u2019 effect on humans. Cannabis oil, which is different to CBD oil because it contains THC - the compound that gives users a 'high' - is illegal under UK laws. Billy Caldwell, from Castlederg, Northern Ireland, made headlines last April when he became the first Briton to be prescribed it on the NHS. Cannabis oil, which reportedly has no side effects, influences the release and uptake of \u2018feel good\u2019 chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin.\n\n'Our findings highlight that cannabis oil application, in conjunction with antibiotic treatment, may be an interesting addition to the development of new antibiotics to help reduce antibiotic resistance, especially given that antibiotic resistance is on the rise and predicted to be a global health disaster.'\n\nBut the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, only showed CBD oil to be effective on certain types of bacteria.\n\nWhen they applied the same amount of cannabis oil to staphylococcus aureus, a harmless bacteria found on the skin, it had little effect on OMV production.\n\nResearchers believe it is because staphylococcus aureus is a gram-negative bacteria.\n\nThe primary difference between gram-negative and gram positive bacteria is the thickness of their cell walls.\n\nThe researchers told MailOnline: 'Thin walled bacteria (gram-negative) are known to release overall more numbers of membrane vesicles and also more different types of membrane vesicles than thick-walled bacteria (gram-positive).\n\n'Particularly in thin-walled bacteria, which also release more vesicles, CBD was found to be a very potent inhibitor of membrane vesicles.\n\n'CBD was also found, in combination with the different antibiotics, to have more bacterial killing effects than when the antibiotics were used alone.\n\n'Some effects on making thick-walled bacteria more sensitive to antibiotics was also observed by the team in this study.\n\n'This indicates that CBD, in combination with specific antibiotics, may be used to selectively target bacteria to make them less antibiotic resistant.'\n\nDr Mikael Sodergren, consultant hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust hailed the study as promising and called for clinical studies in real patients.\n\nDr Sodergren, who is also managing director of Sapphire Medical Clinics, added: 'This is an interesting study that adds to the body of evidence that illustrates CBD can help the body to fight infections.\n\n'The next step is now to set up clinical trials to provide the evidence of benefit in real patients.\n\n'As the threat of antibiotic resistance in wider population increases it is encouraging that the development of novel antibiotics and test adjuvant agents such as CBD is taking place.\n\n'Sapphire Medical Clinicians will monitor this closely to see what benefit patients could seek from this promising development.'", "description": "Researchers from the University of Westminster found CBD oil significantly reduced E.
