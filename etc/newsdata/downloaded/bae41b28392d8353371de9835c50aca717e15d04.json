REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nThe Swiss star played aggressively throughout the 86-minute, second-round match, winning 81 percent of his points at the net. Federer won 91 percent of his first-service points, never faced a break point and finished with eight aces and zero double faults.\n\n\u201cServe was solid. I was hitting my spots and really was never in trouble there,\u201d said Federer, who came back from 4-1 down in the tiebreak.\n\nFederer, seeking his 29th career ATP Masters 1000 title, admitted he was thinking about his 2015 loss to Ramos-Vinolas before the match.\n\n\u201cWatched highlights. Remember how it felt. I had my chances. I won many more points that time than I lost, so I should have actually won that match,\u201d Federer said. \u201c... To play him again in the same circumstances, basically I knew (he) could be dangerous, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m very pleased how I was able to control the match out there today.\u201d\n\nA two-time Shanghai champion (2014, 2017), the 38-year-old Federer will face either No. 13 seed David Goffin of Belgium or Kazakhstan\u2019s Mikhail Kukushkin for a spot in the quarterfinals. Goffin beat France\u2019s Richard Gasquet 6-2, 6-3 on Tuesday and Kukushkin eliminated Serbian Miomir Kecmanovic on Monday.\n\nIn other second-round play, Italy\u2019s Fabio Fognini knocked out three-time Shanghai champ Andy Murray of Scotland 7-6 (4), 2-6, 7-6 (2) in three hours and nine minutes.\n\nMurray served for the match at 5-4 and 6-5 in the deciding set, but couldn\u2019t put away the 10th-seeded Fognini. Fognini will face either No. 7 seed Karen Khachanov of Russia or Taylor Fritz in the third round.\n\nNo. 3 seed Daniil Medvedev improved to 25-3 in his last 28 matches with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over British qualifier Cameron Norrie in just 55 minutes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying my best to keep the form I have,\u201d said Medvedev, who leads the ATP with 55 wins in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s really not easy, because as soon as you relax a little bit, the results will start to fall. That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying not to relax.\u201d\n\nOther winners Tuesday included No. 11 seed Matteo Berrettini of Italy, No. 15 seed Nikoloz Basilashvili of Georgia, Australia\u2019s John Millman and Canadians Vasek Pospisil and Felix Auger-Aliassime. Poland\u2019s Hubert Hurkacz upset No. 9 seed Gael Monfils of France, 6-2, 7-6 (1).\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Four years after a stunning second-round loss to Albert Ramos-Vinolas at this venue, No. 2 seed Roger Federer defeated the Spaniard 6-2, 7-6 (5) on Tuesday at the Shanghai Masters in China.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438497882&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF97196-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
