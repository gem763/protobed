REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nThe Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee issued the subpoena in consultation with two other House panels and said in a statement that Giuliani had acknowledged on television that he asked the government of Ukraine to \u201ctarget\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nDemocrats have been moving quickly since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced last Tuesday that she was formerly launching an impeachment inquiry. On Friday, the three committees announced that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been subpoenaed, and depositions scheduled for five other State Department officials.\n\nOn Monday, Giuliani was asked to hand over documents related to Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden, a top contender for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump as the Republican president seeks re-election in 2020.\n\n\u201cOur inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the President in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President,\u201d the committee chairmen said in a letter to Giuliani.\n\nThey said Giuliani had stated that he had evidence such as text messages and telephone records, indicating that other Trump administration officials might have been involved in the scheme to put pressure on Ukraine to become involved in the 2020 election.\n\nGiuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nForeign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said letters were also sent seeking documents and setting deposition dates for three Giuliani associates, including businessman Lev Parnas and real estate investor Igor Fruman, who, according to various media accounts, helped introduce Giuliani into top Ukrainian political circles.\n\nA letter was also sent to Semyon \u201cSam\u201d Kislin, a Ukrainian immigrant who has had business ties to Trump and served on Giuliani\u2019s city economic development corporation when Giuliani was mayor of New York.\n\nParnas\u2019 deposition was set for Oct. 10, Fruman\u2019s for Oct. 11 and Kislin\u2019s for Oct. 14.\n\nIn a letter, the committees asked the three to advise them by 5 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 1, about whether they intended to comply with their requests for documents and to appear for the deposition.", "description": "U.S. House of Representatives Democrats investigating whether to impeach President Donald Trump on Monday issued a subpoena to his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, seeking documents related to dealings with Ukraine by Oct. 15.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435653701&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1D3", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
