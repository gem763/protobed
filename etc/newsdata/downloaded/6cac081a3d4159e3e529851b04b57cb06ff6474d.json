Sometimes it's good, but a lot of times, you don't really feel that it's the Arsenal how we know it, with the passion and a few players who make the difference.\n\n'It's different. It's difficult to say if it's better or worse, well better, of course, is always shown in trophies, which aren't there at the moment.\n\n'On one hand, there are so many clubs who have improved so quickly to a high level, whereas Arsenal, maybe improved, but not to that level.\n\n'It's hard, it's difficult, it hurts sometimes because you feel about Arsenal that they should do better, but I'm still hoping.'\n\nBergkamp was part of two Double winning sides and the famous Invincibles during his time at Highbury.", "description": "The Dutchman was part of the last Arsenal side to lift the Premier League title in 2004, the third of three league trophies he won during his time in England.", "authors": ["James Dutton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19545106-0-image-a-106_1570719938741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
