Though I love the movie, and I\u2019m glad this last-minute rerelease got me off my bum to see it in a cinema a second time, I\u2019d like to issue a clarifying warning to anyone thinking of buying a ticket: manage your expectations!\n\nThe new footage isn\u2019t added scene work. It\u2019s two gags, a throwaway moment that gets a little stretched out and one thing that\u2019s pretty cool but completely unnecessary. Moreover, they bookend the movie \u2013 two bits before the studio logo and two bits after all the closing credits have run. These are DVD bonus features and nothing more. But, again, these are DVD bonus features for one of the best movies of the year.\n\nQuentin Tarantino won't censor Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for China \u2013 report Read more\n\nThe first of the four moments is a fake commercial for Red Apple cigarettes, the fictional brand that has appeared in many previous Tarantino films. There already was a spoof Red Apple commercial that rolled alongside the closing credits; if you ran to the rest room as soon as DiCaprio\u2019s Rick Dalton entered the Polanski-Tate house you may have missed this the first time. But this one is in color, and is a few talking heads biting into a red apple, and then smoking a Red Apple cigarette. It\u2019s just as banal and annoying as an actual television ad from 1969, so, in terms of \u201cworld-building\u201d, it\u2019s great.\n\nThere\u2019s also a nice punchline at the end, when \u201cBurt Reynolds \u2013 Actor\u201d (played by James Marsden) shows up to endorse the smokes. Marsden had been announced as playing Reynolds before the movie debuted at Cannes but was cut, so this is a nice \u201cthere he is!\u201d for hardcore Marsden-heads, who probably do exist somewhere.\n\nThe second fake ad is for Old Chattanooga beer, which is Pitt\u2019s Cliff Booth\u2019s brand of choice in the film for when he\u2019s making mac and cheese and watching Mannix with his dog. Tarantino and his team really nailed the look and feel of old commercials; the film stock, the voice over, the shot of the six-pack covered in crushed ice do provide some nostalgic comfort to those who remember American television of a previous era. I wish I could grab one and yank its old, sharp, unsafe pull-tabs right now.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth.

I\u2019ll take this opportunity to say that if you liked it a lot the first time and were on the fence about seeing it a second time: go. This is a gorgeous movie that deserves the big screen, and watching it without wondering when it will break from history \u2013 and who will live or die \u2013 is a rewarding experience. The craftiness of the screenplay really struck me this time. I picked up on more of the symmetry between the three storylines of Dalton, Booth and Margot Robbie\u2019s Sharon Tate. There was also more time to study all of the 1969-era billboards on those California roads.\n\nWhen all the closing credits ended, the third, longest and best added scene began. It\u2019s a \u201cfinished\u201d sequence from the pilot to Lancer, the show-within-the-film that Dalton co-stars in. We watch a stagecoach roll into town and Luke Perry in a powder blue suit gets out. He sees his brother (Timothy Olyphant) and they verbally spar with one another. \u201cDon\u2019t call me brother!\u201d is clearly meant to be Lancer\u2019s catchphrase.\n\nSince there is no inherent drama in the scene (it has no relevance to the actual story of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood) it\u2019s hard to care about what\u2019s being said. It\u2019s essentially just a dry scene set on a western-dressed backlot. However, the little girl Julia Butters (the one who tells DiCaprio \u201cthat was the best acting I\u2019ve seen in my life\u201d) gets more screen time, and this is, as Ben Kingsley says in Schindler\u2019s List, \u201can absolute good\u201d.\n\nWhen the scene ends, the hyperactive director Sam Wanamaker (played by Nicholas Hammond) shouts \u201clook out Hayley Mills!\u201d\n\nThe final added scene is the only one that feels like cheating. At the beginning of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood there\u2019s a clip of Dalton\u2019s old television show Bounty Law. Here we see it again, only longer. More Michael Madsen sounding tough. Shrug.\n\nThe one thing I can say in its defense is that when the \u201cshow\u201d cuts to commercial, we get an announcement saying that Bounty Law is brought to us by Red Apple cigarettes (naturally) but also by Hostess Brands\u2019 Twinkies, America\u2019s Favorite Snack Cake. There\u2019s maybe some kind of twisted poetry to one of the best movies about how the pop culture confection gets made ending with a pitch for a sugary sponge.", "description": "A longer version of the director\u2019s hit Tinseltown Oscar front-runner has hit US cinemas with 10 more minutes of questionable action", "authors": ["Jordan Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b44afbbd99b42b4d1a41ab4230d8226d7ad7d54a/0_330_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=808a051e6866d9dfc2f059e415bd5c51", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
