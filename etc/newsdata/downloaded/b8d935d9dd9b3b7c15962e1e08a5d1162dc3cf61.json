Out of sheer curiosity, I tallied the numbers up and was shocked to realize that I spent three long, lonely months of last year living in hotels and cramped airplane seats. When I told my wife, she suggested I start paying rent to Manchester Airport rather than our landlord.\n\nMake no mistake, travel is lonely. Technology dulls the sting somewhat, but when you\u2019re in a country where roaming isn\u2019t free (as a Brit, I can use my phone unrestricted in 27 other EU countries \u2013 for now), it\u2019s difficult. And then I got the Skyroam Solis X. This 4G travel hotspot lets you use the internet from over 130 countries without racking up a hefty cell phone bill. You can choose to pay based per gigabyte (1GB costs $9), or by the day (24 hours of usage costs $9).\n\nIt also comes with some features I\u2019ve never really used \u2013 or understood, for that matter. It packs an 8MP camera, allowing you to take hands-free selfies. There\u2019s also a smart assistant that works with IFTTT, and you can use it as a power bank to charge your gadgets, although this inevitably cuts into your Internet time.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not particularly attractive, either. With my glasses off, the Skyyroam Solis X looks a bit like the unholy lovechild of a hockey puck and a high-visibility jacket. I\u2019ve often joked that it\u2019s the official travel accessory of the Gilets Jaunes movement.\n\nBut despite those flaws, I\u2019ve found this portable router to be an invaluable travel companion. There\u2019s something genuinely comforting about being able to video chat with my wife when we\u2019re separated by time zones. All I have to do is press the \u201con\u201d button on my Skyroam, wait a few minutes for it to power up and connect to the local cellular network, and then can I see her face.\n\nAnd on multiple occasions, the Skyroam has proven to be a professional lifesaver. In August, I was sat on the terrace of a rustic caf\u00e9, high in the Swiss Alps. As I looked over the pacifying vista of vineyards and Lake Geneva, I had the unwelcome revelation that I was about to miss an important news embargo. Oh, and there was no Wi-Fi. The Skyroam saved my bacon. And the connection was annoyingly faster than what I\u2019d get at home. I was getting 42Mbps, which was more than adequate for filing copy.\n\nThe Skyroam Solis X costs $180. You can also rent it at certain airports. That said, if you were to invest in a unit, I\u2019d recommend you instead opt for the cheaper Skyroam Solis Lite, which retails for $120. It\u2019s virtually the same product, except without the camera and smart assistant. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nOn the rare occasions I get to travel for fun, I\u2019m always accompanied by my wife. We typically vacation in the US, where my wife lived before immigrating to the UK. And as you\u2019d expect from a nauseatingly loved-up newlywed couple, we like to watch the same in-flight movie together.\n\nIn the past, we used a cheap headphone splitter that we bought from a random Amazon vendor. Although this worked well, it was a bit tricky when one of us needed to go to the restroom.\n\nEnter the RHA Wireless Flight Adaptor, which lets you connect two pairs of Bluetooth headphones to a standard 3.5mm output or one of those awkward two-pronged jacks you only see on aircraft.Hailing from Glasgow, RHA is a rising audio tech brand. Its headphones come highly rated, but the Wireless Flight Adaptor is the company\u2019s first foray into accessories.\n\nIt\u2019s a fairly nondescript square of plastic. Squint, and it looks a bit like a scaled-down version of a Square card reader. Its internal battery can broadcast for 16 hours, or continuously when plugged-in via the USB-C connector.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a vastly more comfortable way of watching movies while ensnared in the misery of coach. When I\u2019m traveling solo, I don\u2019t have to remember to bring a wired cable with me. And when I\u2019m heading stateside with my wife, I can pass the time watching Two Broke Girls with my wife\u2019s head on my shoulder. Bliss. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse. Follow us on Twitter and sign up for our newsletter for even more recommendations and exclusive content.
