REUTERS/Henry Romero\n\nThe massive, partly-built brewery has been a bone of contention with local protest groups, which argue it will cause water shortages in one of the driest regions of the country.\n\nLopez Obrador told a regular news briefing that authorities should not be granting permits to create dairy areas and build breweries in the north of Mexico where water is scarce.\n\n\u201cJust imagine the authorization they gave to build a big plant to produce beer in Mexicali. No,\u201d the president said, without mentioning Constellation Brands by name.\n\n\u201cIf someone wants to produce beer - in case it\u2019s necessary - in the southeast, that\u2019s where the Papaloapan is, the Grijalva, the Usumacinta,\u201d he added, naming several major rivers in Mexico. \u201cThat\u2019s where 70% of the country\u2019s water is.\u201d\n\nLopez Obrador raised the subject of the brewery when discussing what his government was doing to protect the environment. In March, he said he would have a study carried out on how the Mexicali plant affected water supplies in the area.\n\nThe president did not speak further on the brewery, but said there should be more \u201chorizontal development\u201d in Mexico, where the south has long lagged behind the north economically.\n\nTaking office in December, Lopez Obrador pledged to revive Mexico\u2019s sluggish economy. But his cancellation of a new Mexico City airport and criticism of investments agreed under the previous administration has alarmed business leaders.\n\nConstellation, the U.S. producer of Corona and Modelo beers, has said the plant will not threaten local water supplies. The company unveiled the project in January 2016 with a price tag of $1.5 billion, saying it would take 4 to 5 years to build.\n\nA veteran leftist, Lopez Obrador maintains the previous six governments were tainted by \u201cneo-liberal\u201d economics that served to enrich a corrupt political and corporate elite.\n\nLast month he said he had forced a group of infrastructure companies to accept reworked terms for several natural gas pipeline contracts, saving the public $4.5 billion.", "description": "Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday criticized the location of Constellation Brands Inc's planned brewery in the northern border city of Mexicali, in the latest swipe at a major investment agreed before he took power.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433021131&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1KV", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
