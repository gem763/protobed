I grew up frequenting Costco's rival, Sam's Club, in my Louisiana hometown, and I'm also no stranger to Costcos in the US.\n\nRelated: I'm a die-hard Costco fan who shopped at Sam's Club for the first time \u2014 and I know which store I'll continue to visit\n\nBut I recently decided to check out one of the Costco stores in the Sydney area to compare the supermarket to its American counterpart.\n\nThe moment I stepped foot in the store, I immediately felt as if I had journeyed 8,800 miles back home to the US.
