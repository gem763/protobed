Captain Nik Ledgerwood converted after goalkeeper Connor James was unable to parry.\n\nA series of heavy tackles defined a first half that the Cavs had the better of, keeping the Eddies from recording a shot on target.\n\nPhysical play continued in the second frame as the Eddies found more space on the break. Striker Tomi Ameobi had the best chance of the game in the 70th minute when Edem Mortotsi played him in on goal. Ameobi struck the ball straight at Cavs 'keeper Niko Giantsopoulos.\n\nFC Edmonton's fortunes would change soon after, however, when Jeannot Esua was given a red card for shoving a Cavs player after a whistle.\n\nGiantsopoulos would save the match for the Cavs late, when a diving stop on a Diouck free-kick. James would follow up with his own big save in injury time after a one-on-one with Cavs forward Dom Malonga.\n\nYork9 shuts out Pacific to claim tight road win\n\nYork9 FC is back in the win column, as they snapped a five-game winless streak by beating Pacific FC 2-0 on Wednesday night at Westhills Stadium.\n\nEnding their four-match road trip on a high note, the Nine Stripes leapfrogged their West Coast foes to seize fourth place in the CPL's Fall competition.\n\nThe home side had the upper hand, with 10 shots, although their failure to put many of them on target (only three) meant that they never truly challenged York9 goalkeeper Nathan Ingham.\n\nThe second half seemed slated to go down much the same way, with neither side taking control. On the back of a ten-minute run of pressure from Pacific, though, it was York9 that broke the deadlock just after the hour mark.\n\nFullback Morey Doner made the run up the right flank, dispatching his marker with deceptive stepovers, and he fired in a cross for Rodrigo Gattas to catch with his head. Although Pacific's Mark Village saved the initial shot, Simon Adjei was right on the doorstep to bury the chance for York9.\n\nPacific's comeback attempt was a valiant one, with Noah Verhoeven and Jose Hernandez coming in to try and draw the home side level. Again, though, it was the Nine Stripes who struck after Pacific failed to convert the chances they created. Finding the ball at the top of the box, Simon Adjei stepped around his defender with some tricky footwork and slotted a low shot past the near post to put the game to bed, securing three much-welcomed points for York9.", "description": "Cavalry FC captured Al Classico bragging rights on Wednesday, beating their Albertan rivals FC Edmonton 1-0 at Clarke Stadium.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280453.1568256846!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cpl-091119.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
