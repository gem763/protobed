But he was shouting that I was a fascist, apparently.\u201d\n\nWest Midlands police confirmed a 36-year-old man had been arrested outside the office on Yardley Road in Acocks Green, Birmingham.\n\nThe incident came after Phillips tabled an urgent question to the Commons on the subject of inflammatory language.\n\nPhillips has frequently spoken about the abuse she has received at the hands of internet trolls, including threats of rape.\n\nAfter the prime minister, Boris Johnson, denied accusations that his language was being appropriated by abusers, Phillips shared an image of a death threat she had received on paper that read: \u201cIt was rather prophetic that Boris Johnson should say: \u2018I would rather be found dead in a ditch.\u2019 That is what will happen to those who do not deliver Brexit.\u201d\n\nA statement by West Midlands police said: \u201cPolice were called to reports of a disturbance outside an address on Yardley Road in Acocks Green, Birmingham just before 2.25pm this afternoon [26 September].\n\n\u201cA 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and possession of cannabis. He\u2019s been taken into police custody and will be questioned in due course.\u201d", "description": "Man allegedly tried to smash windows after Phillips tabled urgent question in the Commons on inflammatory language", "authors": ["Jamie Grierson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ccec4474ee6b18282e35e81d5f3e13331f8b1e6/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=14e7bf24e07491dc2736fd6e88cc3fc2", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
