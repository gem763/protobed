Mandatory Credit: Jesse Johnson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 The New York Yankees used 155 different lineup combinations during the regular season.\n\nBut in the American League Division Series, they only used one.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily the combination they thought they\u2019d use \u2014 or even have, for that matter \u2014 come playoff time.\n\nBut that\u2019s how baseball works.\n\nYou always have to be ready for anything \u2014 in this case, an MLB-record 30 different players on the injured list with a total of 39 different IL stints.\n\nAnd that means having depth.\n\nJust take a look at the team\u2019s Opening Day lineup \u2014 Brett Gardner CF, Aaron Judge RF, Giancarlo Stanton LF, Luke Voit DH, Miguel Andujar 3B, Gary Sanchez C, Greg Bird 1B, Gleyber Torres 2B, Troy Tulowitzki SS \u2014 and compare it to its postseason lineup below.\n\nQuite a difference.\n\nYet, the at-bat quality. The ability to control the strike zone. The ability to do damage. And the ability to wear opposing pitchers down with long at-bats. That all remains the same for manager Aaron Boone\u2019s \u201csavages in the box.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees led the majors with 943 runs, and ranked second with 306 homers during the regular season. And they followed it up with 23 more runs and five more homers during their three-game sweep of the Minnesota Twins.\n\nThe Bronx Bombers now face the Houston Astros in the ALCS, four wins away from their first World Series appearance in a decade. And they\u2019ll have to overcome a ridiculously good pitching staff that includes Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke to get there.\n\nStory continues\n\nCole, in particular, has been brilliant, posting 11 straight double-digit strikeout performances (including playoffs). He is 18-0 with a 1.66 ERA in his last 24 starts (also including playoffs). A scout who has seen him pitch this season referred to Cole as a \u201cone-in-a-million arm.\u201d \u201cRight up there with the deGroms and Scherzers,\u201d the scout said. \u201cHe\u2019s been pretty special.\u201d A combination of high velocity, late movement and precise location makes him so.\n\nThe Yankees selected the 29-year-old righty \u2014 a fan of the Bombers growing up \u2014 in the first round of the 2008 MLB Draft but never even got a chance to negotiate with him (despite a reported $4 million signing bonus that awaited) because Cole was dead-set on attending UCLA.\n\nThey then tried to trade for him a decade later, but wouldn\u2019t include emerging youngsters Torres or Andujar in a package with the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was certainly understandable at the time (the Pirates went for Joe Musgrove and Colin Moran over a Yankees\u2019 package built around Clint Frazier and Nick Solak). And now they could look to him again in free agency depending on what happens the rest of the way.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s how GM Brian Cashman and the rest of his vaunted front-office staff assembled the October starting nine:\n\n1. 1B D.J. LeMahieu: signed last offseason for two years, $24 million\n\n2019 Salary: $12,000,000\n\nIt seemed like an odd fit at the time. And the splits suggested LeMahieu benefitted a ton from hitting at Coors Field.\n\nBut in reality, LeMahieu turned out to be one of the best free-agent signings in franchise history, hitting .327 with 26 homers and 102 RBIs in an All-Star age-30 campaign for the ages.\n\nCashman credits assistant GM Mike Fishman, director of quantitative analysis David Grabiner and director of baseball operations Matt Ferry for selling him on LeMahieu. In particular, Cashman said of the analytics-reliant Fishman: \u201cHe should be everyone\u2019s go-get No. 1 GM candidate. He\u2019s as smart as they come.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur pro scouting side confirmed that he could play first and third and was very athletic,\u201d Cashman said of LeMahieu, who wound up playing all over the infield and cementing himself in the leadoff spot. \u201c(Special assistant to the GM) Jim Hendry had him when he was with the Cubs. He spoke highly of D.J.\u2019s character as a baseball rat. Everything matched up.\u201d\n\nAnd it certainly worked out. No need for Manny Machado or Bryce Harper after all.\n\n2. RF Aaron Judge: No. 32 overall selection in the first round of the 2013 MLB Draft\n\n2019 Salary: $684,300\n\nYankees ownership reluctantly extended Nick Swisher the $13.3 million qualifying offer in November 2012 upon convincing from Cashman.\n\n\u201c\u2018What if he accepts it?\u2019\u201d they asked.\n\n\u201c\u2018No, he\u2019s not going to accept it because he\u2019s going to get a multi-year deal elsewhere,\u2019\u201d replied Cashman, who had good intel on the situation.\n\nSwisher did get a multi-year deal elsewhere \u2014 from the Cleveland Indians.\n\nAs a result, the Yankees got a compensation pick in the form of Judge, one of three-first rounders the team selected that year (3B Eric Jagielo, SP Ian Clarkin).\n\nVP of domestic amateur scouting Damon Oppenheimer ultimately pulled the trigger on the raw slugger out of Fresno State with massive help from his department.\n\nFrom there, Judge began to script a storybook beginning to his career, ascending to the role of superstar, leader and franchise player.\n\n3. CF Brett Gardner: No. 109 overall selection in the third round of the 2005 MLB Draft\n\n2019 Salary: $7,500,000\n\nRead Tim Brown on how the Yankees found him. It seems unfair to summarize it here.\n\nBut just think about the role Gardner was supposed to be playing now: fourth outfielder/defensive replacement/pinch-runner.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way baseball works,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cThings never work out as choreographed.\u201d\n\nAnd there are some things that can\u2019t be explained.\n\nBecause seriously: How could a 36-year-old veteran who often fades in the second half go from projected odd-man out following the Encarnacion deal to posting a career-high 28 homers, filling in admirably for Aaron Hicks in center and hitting right in the heart of the order?\n\nIt\u2019s quite a comeback story.\n\n4. DH Edwin Encarnacion: acquired via trade from the Seattle Mariners with cash on June 15 in exchange for Juan Then\n\n2019 Salary: $21,666,666 ($8 million covered by Yankees)\n\nThis one was the perfect storm.\n\nThe Yankees were more in the market for a pitcher \u2014 not a veteran impact hitter \u2014 but they ended up being in the right place at the right time, with Seattle looking to rebuild and shed salary.\n\nThe Mariners agreed to pay $8,397,849 of the remaining $16,397,849 Encarnacion was owed.\n\nPlus, Then, a 19-year-old pitcher, wasn\u2019t considered a top prospect in New York\u2019s farm system.\n\nIt added up to the Yankees acquiring Encarnacion, who has a history of delivering in clutch moments.\n\nAgain, Cashman credited his analytics staff for putting the wheels in motion on the move.\n\n\u201cWe knew what he\u2019s capable of because we\u2019d seen it first-hand, obviously, with Toronto, Cleveland and Seattle,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cIt was just how he would fit? And so we were willing to play on it under certain circumstances, and those circumstances played out right for us.\u201d\n\nWith all the injuries the Yankees endured, Encarnacion quickly went from luxury to necessity. And in October, nothing has changed in that regard.\n\n5. LF Giancarlo Stanton: acquired via trade from the Miami Marlins with cash on Dec. 11, 2017 in exchange for Starlin Castro, Jorge Guzman and Jose Devers\n\n2019 Salary: $26,000,000\n\nIt\u2019s pretty well-documented at this point.\n\nDerek Jeter\u2019s Marlins were looking to gut their roster and get out of their massive remaining commitment to Stanton \u2014 the reigning NL MVP at the time \u2014 whom they still owed $295 million over 10 years.\n\nCashman and Marlins GM Michael Hill had their first talks about the slugger at the GM Meetings. At the time, the Yankees were pursuing Shohei Otani but didn\u2019t land him, turning Cashman\u2019s attention toward Stanton.\n\nStanton ultimately vetoed trades to the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals via his no-trade clause before agreeing to go to The Bronx. The blockbuster deal \u2014 which the Bombers felt was simply too good to pass up after Jeter\u2019s attempt to strong-arm Stanton failed \u2014 became official during the winter meetings.\n\nThe Marlins will pay the Yankees $30 million if Stanton doesn\u2019t opt out following the 2020 campaign.\n\nTwo years in, it\u2019s a move the organization probably regrets \u2014 although no one has ever admitted so publicly.\n\nGranted, Stanton can quickly change the narrative with a couple big hits in the next round (or two).\n\n6. 2B Gleyber Torres: acquired via trade from the Chicago Cubs with Adam Warren, Billy McKinney and Rashad Crawford on July 25, 2016 in exchange for Aroldis Chapman\n\n2019 Salary: $605,200\n\nThe Yankees won. The Cubs won.\n\nIt\u2019s how blockbuster deals are supposed to work.\n\nChapman helped Chicago snap a 108-year World Series title drought. And Torres has emerged as a superstar \u2014 albeit with more power than expected \u2014 just like everyone anticipated. The key, of course, was Cashman convincing ownership it was time to sell.\n\nAs has been written in this space before, the Yankees pursued Torres as an international free agent in 2013 before losing out to the Cubs. But they were eventually able to get their man, prompting Cashman to call the team\u2019s director of international scouting, Donny Rowland, and exclaim: \u201c\u2018We got him! We finally got him!\u2019\u201d\n\nTorres posted a team-high 38 homers during the regular season and added another against the Twins \u2014 the first playoff homer of his career.\n\nAgain, he\u2019s only 22. Also, the Cubs would do it all over again. The payoff was worth it for both sides.\n\n7. C Gary Sanchez: signed as an international free agent on July 2, 2009 for $3 million\n\n2019 Salary: $669,800\n\nA decade ago, Cashman traveled to Boca Chica, Dominican Republic to work out Sanchez and sign off on his bonus.\n\n\u201cHe was going to see the Mets later that afternoon, and we agreed (to terms) before he did,\u201d Cashman recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 Because I didn\u2019t want (former Mets GM) Omar Minaya to work him out.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees were ultimately the beneficiaries of adding one of the best offensive catchers in baseball. Sanchez has also improved behind the plate as well.\n\nAnd the depth of their lineup really shows with a hitter as impressive as Sanchez hitting seventh.\n\n8. SS Didi Gregorius: acquired via three-way trade from the Arizona Diamondbacks on Dec. 5, 2014 in exchange for Shane Greene\n\n2019 Salary: $11,750,000\n\nVice president of baseball operations Tim Naehring was highest on Gregorius, who was thrust into the spotlight from the start, having to replace a franchise icon in Jeter.\n\nAfter a slow start to his career in pinstripes, Gregorius\u2019 development has been extremely impressive, as he\u2019s evolved into a two-way sensation at short.\n\nComing off Tommy John surgery, the 30-year-old veteran ended this season in a massive slump, though, and there have been outside rumblings that the Yankees may look to move on from the pending free agent.\n\nYet Gregorius has rediscovered his swing so far in October, perhaps the team\u2019s most impactful player in the first round (four hits, one homer, six RBIs).\n\nHe\u2019s certainly making a strong case to stay \u2014 or get paid elsewhere \u2014 if he can keep it up.\n\n9. 3B Gio Urshela: acquired via trade on Aug. 4, 2018 from the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for $25,000; ultimately stuck with Yankees on a minor-league deal which contained a spring-training invite\n\n2019 Salary: $547,177\n\nNo Machado. No Andujar. No problem.\n\nBut the craziest part of it all: any team could\u2019ve picked up Urshela in the Rule 5 Draft this offseason.\n\nRegardless, the Yankees got him on the cheap \u2014 and then kept him on the cheap.\n\nUrshela was able to transform his swing and post a career-high .889 OPS after posting a combined .589 OPS in parts of three seasons with Cleveland and Toronto.\n\n\u201cI remember talking to Aaron (Boone) at the batting cage in the first week of spring games,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cAnd he told me, \u2018I think this guy is for real.\u2019 And I was like, that\u2019d be great if he was. But no one expected him to be Manny Machado.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees have incredible resources at their disposal \u2014 and also use them well.\n\nSure, they\u2019ve had their fair share of misses on players. But there have also been plenty of hits.\n\n\u201cBaseball is a six-month season, but putting together a roster is really a 12-plus months a year job,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why every aspect is important \u2014 from the domestic amateur side to the international amateur side to pro scouting to analytics to player development. All of them are so vital to put together what we have here.\u201d", "description": "The Yankees hit five homers and scored 23 runs in their three-game sweep of the Minnesota Twins in the ALDS.
