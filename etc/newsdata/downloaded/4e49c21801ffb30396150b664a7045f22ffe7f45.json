The American president, facing a growing clamour for his impeachment, used his address to the United Nations General Assembly as a partisan stump speech to rally his base ahead of his 2020 re-election bid. Trump railed against globalism, which he claimed had \u201cexerted a religious pall over past leaders causing them to ignore their own national interests\u201d.\n\nMorrison leaning into Trump might have a strange logic \u2013 but it's a risky strategy | Katharine Murphy Read more\n\nThe Australian prime minister\u2019s arguments were more nuanced.\n\nHe said isolationism and protectionism were not in the national interest. Australia must always seek to have a responsible and participative international agency in addressing global issues, engaging in what he called \u201cpositive and practical globalism\u201d, he said.\n\nBut Morrison said it did not serve the national interest \u201cwhen international institutions demand conformity rather than independent cooperation on global issues\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe world works best when the character and distinctiveness of independent nations is preserved within a framework of mutual respect,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis includes respecting electoral mandates of their constituencies.\n\n\u201cGlobalism must facilitate, align and engage, rather than direct and centralise, as such an approach can corrode support for joint international action.\u201d\n\nMorrison on Thursday night paraphrased the 2001 sovereignty credo of the former Liberal prime minister John Howard \u2013 we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come \u2013 declaring that under his prime ministership, in foreign policy terms, \u201cwe will decide our interests and the circumstances in which we seek to pursue them\u201d.\n\nHe said Australia would take a more proactive role in setting global standards underpinning commerce, investment and exchange. \u201cWe cannot afford to leave it to others to set the standards that will shape our global economy.\u201d\n\nMorrison said he had asked the department of foreign affairs to undertake a comprehensive audit of global institutions and rule-making processes where Australia had the greatest stake.\n\nHe said the world had entered a new era of strategic competition and there were \u201ccontinuing security threats from terrorism, extremist Islam, antisemitism, white supremacism, and evil on a local and global level\u201d.\n\nHe contended pragmatic international engagement, based on the cooperation of sovereign nation states, was \u201cbeing challenged by a new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies\u201d \u2013 although he didn\u2019t give concrete examples.\n\nMorrison said complexities on the world stage coexisted with polarisation within and between societies, and an \u201cera in which elite opinion and attitudes have often become disconnected from the mainstream of their societies, and a sense of resentment and disappointment has emerged\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister said we lived in an era of \u201cinsiders and outsiders, threatening social cohesion, provoking discontent and distrust\u201d.\n\nBut he counselled in favour of optimism. He said we were not the only generation to face complexity and adversity. Morrison said he grew up under the threat of nuclear Armageddon, his parents endured the second world war, and his grandparents the first world war.\n\nMorrison said at every stage of our history, Australia had played its part as a force for good, in partnership with those who shared our outlook and our values.\n\nAustralian PM says China must step up on climate change as 'newly developed' nation Read more\n\nHe said the key to prospering through the transitions \u201cwas individual, like-minded sovereign nations acting together with enlightened self-interest\u201d. The US had played a critical role \u201cbinding together the liberal democracies of the western world\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo preserve this legacy in the face of the uncertainties of our modern world, we must approach the future with the same optimism, confidence and resolve, of previous generations, and through our commitment to the values and beliefs that have always guided our way,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\nMorrison also dug in behind the rationale he floated in last week\u2019s address to the Chicago Institute for Global Affairs that China was now a newly developed economy, not a developing one. He said China\u2019s rise had changed the world \u201cso we would expect the terms of its engagement to change too\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why when we look at negotiating rules of the future of the global economy, for example, we would expect China\u2019s obligations to reflect its greater power status,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a compliment, not a criticism. And that is what I mean when describing China as a newly developed economy.\n\n\u201cThe rules and institutions that support global cooperation must reflect the modern world. It can\u2019t be set and forget.\u201d\n\nIn conversation with Lowy Institute director Michael Fullilove, Morrison said Australia\u2019s currently fractious relationship with China would be managed \u201cin the national interest\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd by being incredibly consistent: we know where our lines are, we know where our benefits are, we know what we share, we know where we disagree \u2026 we are careful in the way we engage, in what we say and what we do. We don\u2019t concede, we don\u2019t step back.\u201d\n\nHe said he would be happy to accept an invitation to visit Beijing, an honour not afforded an Australian prime minister for more than three years \u201cbut I\u2019m not waiting by the phone, and nor should an Australian prime minister be\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf they would like to invite us to come to China, we\u2019d be happy to go \u2026 we should be careful about over-interpreting some of those events ... it\u2019s not troubling me.\u201d\n\nMorrison said while the Chinese government\u2019s overt demonstrations of force this week \u2013 the massive military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the PRC and the forcible crackdown on Hong Kong demonstrators \u2013 were \u201chard to miss\u201d, he said was \u201cconstantly surprised by the surprise\u201d that has greeted China\u2019s rise to economic and military eminence.\n\n\u201cThis is the inevitable result of the path that we deliberately got on [engaging China in the broader global economy a generation ago], so I think it is important in responding, not to get too emotional or outraged that this has occurred, but simply to practically understand that this is where the world\u2019s economy has got to.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Global institutions must not be put above the authority of nation states, PM says in major foreign policy speech", "authors": ["Katharine Murphy", "Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9e0fd6a8cbd389b37a52c208bf4b8dda6b94726/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=53512d7c2ea57eef872c47ac4a08d357"}
