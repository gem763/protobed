Pictures/Trailer image via YouTube)\n\nThe depiction of a man\u2019s descent into insanity is alone worth the price of admission.\n\nWhen I saw that the New York Times and The New Yorker had run columns berating the new Joker movie, criticizing it not simply on cinematic grounds but instead insisting that the film amounted to a clandestine defense of \u201cwhiteness\u201d in an attempt to buttress the electoral aim of \u201cRepublicans\u201d \u2014 this is a Todd Phillips movie we\u2019re talking about! \u2014 I assumed that the film must have been good. Dangerously good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy optimism was tempered by a more respectable source \u2014 my colleague Jim Geraghty \u2014 who expressed his concern that \u201ca certain segment of America\u2019s angry, paranoid, emotionally unstable young men will watch Joaquin Phoenix descending into madness and a desire to get back at society by hurting as many people as possible and exclaim, \u2018finally, somebody understands me!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile the film does chronicle a loner who commits mass violence \u2014 a story with unfortunate real-life corollaries \u2014 Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck will not be anyone\u2019s role model, even \u201cparanoid, emotionally unstable young men.\u201d\n\nPhoenix\u2019s Fleck is not Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker. Ledger\u2019s Joker was competent \u2014 evil, but evil in a way so debased, so wry, and so maniacally deft that he left you impressed. He was edgy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArthur Fleck, the name given to Phoenix\u2019s Joker, is pathetic by contrast. Fleck cannot hold down a job. His speech is riddled with a childish timbre and stochastically interpolated bouts of laughter. He lives with his mother in a dilapidated tenement, and he jaunts about the city of Gotham with his emaciated frame and serpentine posture. He has no navigable social skills, and his mental illnesses are worn plainly on his face, which cannot help but broadcast his internal disorder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nViewers, even \u201cemotionally unstable\u201d ones, are unlikely to find Arthur Fleck a compelling champion. Fleck is not, by any measure, a cunning mastermind; it is evident that he is not even the master of his own faculties.\n\nFleck\u2019s story is one of disaffection and madness. He feels invisible, suffering at the hands of invisible demons in a rundown Gotham apartment. The world, to his dismay, continues to turn about him as if he didn\u2019t exist. His disaffection grows. It culminates in Fleck\u2019s televised admission that he slayed three men on a subway. When the host bristles at his admission, Fleck tells him that the host cares only because the victims were rich. The host, Fleck insists, would walk over his corpse without giving second thought if he, and not the rich men, were left dead. People like him, Arthur avers, suffer on the peripheries, never countenanced by the ruling class or the material and political \u201chaves,\u201d except when they\u2019re useful as props.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat scene is Fleck\u2019s lone moment of lucidity in the film. The rest of the film puts his madness on plain and pitiable display. He scribbles in his notepad with a juvenile penmanship, spelling words incorrectly, jotting down hackneyed lines fitting of a child. He has a pseudobulbar affect \u2014 bouts of laughter that interrupt his speech \u2014 and the incongruity of that laughter gets him punched in the face more than once. Behind the laughter is a plain helplessness and despair, a visceral insanity that comes momentarily to the fore. When Fleck is having a pseudobulbar episode, he\u2019ll hand those around him a card laminated with clear packing tape, which apologizes for his unpropitious laughter. It says, in all-capital letters, \u201cI have a condition.\u201d At the bottom of the card is a pitiful solicitation that the card be returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat struck me most about the new Joker film was its honesty \u2014 an honesty that frequently rendered it hard to watch, an honesty that felt more edifying than entertaining. It did not, to the credit of director Todd Phillips, defer to tropes, or rely on clich\u00e9s. You felt neither undue sympathy nor undue contempt for Fleck, whose evil deeds and pathetic incompetence rendered him a complicated moral figure. It was an accurate depiction of a man\u2019s descent into madness, a descent so often marred by angst and discordance that it\u2019s hard to keep moral score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was brazenly honest in its portrayal of Fleck\u2019s mental illness. Director Todd Phillips no doubt heard the now-banal preachment of the psychological establishment, who warned him not to link Fleck\u2019s mental illness to violence \u2014 \u201cthe movie may stigmatize mental illness,\u201d to quote the typical hand-wringing of one reviewer in the genre.\n\nPhillips was honest \u2014 often excruciatingly so \u2014 in spite of great pressure to be dishonest about the contours of madness. It was painful to watch Fleck\u2019s descent into insanity because of how biting and accurate it was. Fleck\u2019s world caves in on itself, suffocated by what Chesterton calls \u201creason in the void\u201d \u2014 a self-contained world of paranoia and illogic, one whose internal tensions become manifest slowly and then at once. As men go bankrupt, so too they go mad: \u201cGradually, then suddenly.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a portrayal that alone is worth the price of admission.", "description": "You felt neither undue sympathy nor undue contempt for Arthur Fleck, whose evil deeds and pathetic incompetence rendered him a complicated moral figure.", "authors": ["John Hirschauer", "Kevin D.
