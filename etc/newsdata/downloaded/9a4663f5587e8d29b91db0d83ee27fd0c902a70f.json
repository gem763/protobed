But according to New York Times business journalist Binyamin Appelbaum, the president\u2019s \u2018over emphasis\u2019 on Powell and the Fed may be misguided.\n\n\u201cTrump is so fixated on Jerome Powell and the Fed and what they\u2019re going to do, when really the problems in our economy are much broader. It\u2019s the uncertainty about trade, it\u2019s the absence of intelligent fiscal policy, the absence of investment in infrastructure, in research, and in growth. Our lens is focused on the wrong place ... We need to start talking less about monetary policy and more about all of the other things the government can and should be doing\u201d Appelbaum told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Final Round.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a news conference following the Federal Reserve's two-day Federal Open Market Committee Meeting in Washington, U.S., July 31, 2019. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger More\n\nSince World War II, Appelbaum says politicians have come to emphasize economic growth above almost everything else. In his new book, \u201cThe Economists\u2019 Hour: False Prophets, Free Markets and the Fracture of Society,\u201d Appelbaum discusses the U.S. economy and how economists have gained influence and power over the years.\n\n\u201cMaybe Milton Friedman\u2019s most important legacy was convincing policy makers that the central bank is really the only arm over government that can regulate economic growth \u2014 they have the power and that we need to rely on them. I think that needs a reconsideration.\u201d Appelbaum said. In his book, he notes that markets are constructed by people, for purposes chosen by people \u2014 and that people can change the rules.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned from history that when politicians make the Fed an arm of short term policy goals, they\u2019re constantly trying to stimulate growth \u2014 that doesn\u2019t work out well for the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nAll Markets Summit 2019 More\n\nSara Dramer is an associate producer at Yahoo Finance.
