As a result, I have asked to withdraw and I thank the leadership of the Met for graciously granting my request.\u201d\n\nIt sounded unlikely that he would ever be back to perform with the company.\n\n\u201cI am happy that, at the age of 78, I was able to sing the wonderful title role in the dress rehearsal of \u2018Macbeth,\u2019 which I consider my last performance on the Met stage,\u201d he said. \u201cI am grateful to God and the public for what they have allowed me to accomplish here at the Metropolitan Opera.\u201d\n\nThe Met issued a statement that seemed to suggest that the company had asked him to go. \u201cThe Metropolitan Opera confirms that Pl\u00e1cido Domingo has agreed to withdraw from all future performances at the Met, effective immediately,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Met and Mr. Domingo are in agreement that he needed to step down.\u201d\n\nThe accusations against Mr. Domingo were first reported in August by The Associated Press, which wrote that he had pressured women into sexual relationships, and sometimes professionally punished those who had rebuffed him. (In addition to being a star singer, Mr. Domingo has held leadership positions at Washington National Opera and Los Angeles Opera, the companies where many of the accusers met Mr. Domingo.) The news agency\u2019s initial report cited nine women, all but one of whom had been granted anonymity; a subsequent report cited 11 more women, one of whom was named.\n\nThe Domingo case roiled the Met, which is still recovering from the firing of its former music director, James Levine, last year amid accusations of sexual misconduct. In the #MeToo era, it also raised ongoing questions about how institutions deal with accusations of sexual harassment or abuse, even those that emerge outside their walls . And it posed a test for Mr. Gelb, who saw his initial decision \u2014 to go forward with Mr. Domingo\u2019s performances as investigations into his conduct progressed elsewhere \u2014 grow increasingly untenable amid a growing outcry within his company.", "description": "The star singer, accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct, dropped out of Verdi\u2019s \u201cMacbeth\u201d and indicated he would not return to the Met.", "authors": ["Michael Cooper"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/arts/24DOMINGO2-promo/24DOMINGO2-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
