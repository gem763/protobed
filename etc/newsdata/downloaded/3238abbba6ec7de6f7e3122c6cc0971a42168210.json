Canadian McKinnon beat out American Dawn Orwick, and Denmark\u2019s Kirsten Herup Sovang, who took silver and bronze behind McKinnon.\n\nDr. Rachel McKinnon, who was born a man, also won the 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships in Los Angeles in 2018, among other events.\n\nBut not everyone was thrilled by the big win.\n\nJennifer Wagner-Assali, a competitor who lost to McKinnon in the past \u2014 but did not race last weekend \u2014 called McKinnon\u2019s win \u201cunfair,\u201d the Times reported.\n\n\u201cIt was an unfair race, and I accepted that when I pinned on the number, and I tried to do my best to overcome the unfairness,\u201d Wagner-Assali said of McKinnon\u2019s dominance over natural-born female racers.\n\n\u201cI do feel that hard-fought freedoms for women\u2019s sport are being eroded. If we continue to let this happen, there will be men\u2019s sports and co-ed sports, but there won\u2019t be any women\u2019s sports,\u201d Wagner-Assali added.\n\nWagener-Assari also said that if men claiming to be women continue to dominate women\u2019s sports, then many young girls won\u2019t even bother to get into sports. \u201cI see little girls competing . . . and I don\u2019t want them to have to fight this issue,\u201d she said\n\nMcKinnon, though, rebuffed the charge that she was dominating the women\u2019s sport. \u201cI haven\u2019t won any Olympic medals. I haven\u2019t won any elite world championships,\u201d McKinnon said.\n\nBefore Sunday\u2019s race, McKinnon defended the right of transgenders to compete alongside natural-born women saying that \u201cpreventing trans women from competing is denying their human rights.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Transgender Cyclist Rachel McKinnon continues to smash women's cycling records, the latest being a \"world record\" in the women's 200m sprint.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Screenshot-9-2-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
