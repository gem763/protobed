In a series of Tweets, the president also singled out NBC news anchor Lester Holt for not including his efforts in the MSNBC \u201cJustice For All\u201d program, a series investigation on criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cWhen all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cI got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn\u2019t come close.\u201d\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\n\u2026.A man named @VanJones68, and many others, were profusely grateful (at that time!). I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. Guys like boring\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026..the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it\u2026And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cGuys like boring musician John Legend and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2013 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. \u201cAnchor\u201d Lester Holt doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it\u2026And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump!\u201d\n\nBoth Teigen and Legend responded, with Teigen asking the president why he couldn\u2019t even refer to her by name, calling his Tweets his \u201c9th meltdown of the day.\u201d \u201cLol what a pussy ass bitch,\u201d Teigen wrote on Twitter. Tagged everyone but me. An honor, mister president.\u201d She also encouraged fans to get the hashtag # PresidentPussyAssBitch trending.\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nLuna, remember the night before your first day of school?

He wrote, \u201cImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody\u2014ANYBODY\u2014will praise you. Melania, please praise this man.
