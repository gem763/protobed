Princess Beatrice\u2019s wedding will be a not-so-royal affair", "language": "en", "text": "Cape Town \u2013 Princess Beatrice is getting ready to say \"I do\".\n\nThe daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York, is set to marry Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\n\nAt the time of their engagement, no details had officially been released, but, of course, the rumour mill\u2019s been spinning ever since the announcement was made.\n\nSo here\u2019s everything we\u2019ve heard so far about the upcoming nuptials of Princess Beatrice to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\n\nWHEN AND WHERE\n\nWhile many have been speculating that the 2020 nuptials will be a destination wedding, the Duchess of York confirmed to Press Association, \"It can only be Britain.\"\n\nWhile the mother of the bride didn\u2019t give the exact location, one would think it will be at St George\u2019s Chapel \u2013 the same place Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla, Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan and her younger sister, Princess Eugenie got married to Jack Brooksbank. But we did say the rumour mill is spinning, so we\u2019ve also heard the wedding could take place at her parent\u2019s home.\n\nA NOT-SO-ROYAL AFFAIR\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that, because Beatrice is ninth in line to the throne, she isn\u2019t compelled to follow royal protocol \u2013 she didn\u2019t even have to ask permission from the queen to get engaged. So although Princess Eugenie opted to have the full royal wedding affair complete with a kiss on the chapel stairs, Princess Beatrice has reportedly chosen not to.\n\nOne of Beatrice\u2019s friends has revealed that the princess is looking to have something slightly more lowkey. She explained, \"There have been three big royal weddings there [at St George\u2019s Chapel] in the past year or so and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what Bea wants. Edo has a child, there\u2019s the situation with his ex, and Beatrice might just feel something more lowkey might be more fitting.\"\n\nWith that many are saying Beatrice is considering other venues \u2013 with a marquee at her parents\u2019 home, the Royal Lodge at Windsor, as one \u2013 and although we\u2019re sure royal fans will get to see the couple at some point, there will reportedly be no carriage ride and no reception at Windsor Castle after either.\n\nTHE TIARA AND THE DRESS\n\nAccording to HELLO!, though Princess Eugenie looked regal in the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik tiara made up of green stones and diamonds and gifted to the Queen Mother before it was passed down to Queen Elizabeth, many think Princess Beatrice may wear her mother\u2019s diamond and platinum scroll tiara.\n\n(The Duchess of York on her wedding day in 1986.

But then again, Bea isn\u2019t afraid to take risks with her fashion choices, wearing colourful, printed pieces with statement accessories before \u2013 and she\u2019s certainly got a list of designers she often steps out in.\n\nMSGM, Alberta Ferretti, Self-Portrait, Valentino, Mary Katrantzou and Roksanda are just a few of the big names Beatrice could choose to design the perfect dress.\n\nGUESTLIST\n\nOf course, the entire royal family will probably be invited to the wedding (fingers crossed Archie gets the honour of ring bearer), but so too will a long list of celebrity guests if any of the other royal weddings are anything to go by.\n\nRobbie Williams and his wife, Ayda Field, Ellie Goulding, Karlie Kloss and Misha Nonoo \u2013 who is also close friends with Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry, are all very close to the royal. POPSUGAR reports Robbie Williams even refers to the princess as \u201csis\u201d, while Ellie, Karlie and Misha all vacayed with Bea in Jordan last year, reports Town & Country.", "description": "Here's everything we know about Princess Beatrice's upcoming wedding to Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8923/346b902636cf42ea81c27fe21a56ce2e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
