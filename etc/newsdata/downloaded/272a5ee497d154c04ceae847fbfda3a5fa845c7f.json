That is higher than Cloudflare\u2019s elevated range: The company had stated a target of $12 to $14 earlier in the week, after starting the process seeking $10 to $12 a share. The company, which specializes in a cloud-based network platform that promises security, enhanced performance of business-critical applications, and \u201celiminating the cost and complexity of managing individual network hardware,\u201d will raise at least $525 million in the offering with an initial valuation of $4.4 billion.\n\nCloudflare plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol \u201cNET.\u201d Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan are lead underwriters on the deal with another eight banks acting as co-managers, and they will have access to an additional 5.25 million shares. Proceeds of the deal will be used to for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe IPO comes just a few months after cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD, +0.80% went public in June. While CrowdStrike shares are trading 111% above their IPO price, the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security HACK, -0.47% is up 13% for the year while the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO, +0.03% is up 30%, and the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY, +0.12% is up 18%, compared with a 22% gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.30%.\n\nHere are five things to know from the company\u2019s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nCloudflare sees itself ahead of the curve compared with many big players\n\nThe San Francisco-based company said its service blocks 44 billion cyber threats from 20 million internet properties daily, and that it is better suited to today\u2019s cloud environment. Security patches are no longer hardware-based \u201cBand-Aid boxes,\u201d and even if they were, they would be incapable of scaling and are largely incompatible with cloud-based architectures.\n\n\u201cThis is forcing a major architectural shift in how enterprises address security, performance, and reliability at the network layer,\u201d Cloudflare said. \u201cThe functionality provided by companies such as Cisco Systems CSCO, -0.20%, Juniper Networks JNPR, -0.20%, F5 Networks FFIV, -0.72%, Check Point Software CHKP, -1.15%, Palo Alto Networks PANW, -2.41%, FireEye FEYE, -0.14%, Riverbed Technology and others is being elevated, abstracted and unified into the cloud.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis transition has created a vast opportunity both in expanding the market to address underserved businesses and replacing Band-Aid box vendors, and the budget spent on their increasingly obsolete devices, in the enterprise,\u201d the company said. \u201cCloudflare is leading this transition.\u201d\n\nExpenses are outpacing revenue growth\n\nIn 2018, Cloudflare reported a loss of $86.1 million on revenue of $192.7 million, compared with a $10.7 million loss on revenue of $134.9 million in 2017. So while revenue grew 43%, expenses skyrocketed 711%. That appears to have been due to a big jump in general and administrative expenses, which jumped to $85.2 million in 2018, from $20.3 million in 2017\n\n\u201cWe expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth as well as due to additional costs associated with legal, accounting, compliance, insurance, investor relations, and other costs as we become a public company,\u201d Cloudflare said in its filing.\n\nA growing unicorn\n\nBack in 2012, Cloudflare was already valued at $1 billion based on $72 million in funding, according to The Wall Street Journal. Since then, the company received $150 million in Series E funding from Franklin Templeton Investments in March, for 176,000 Class B shares, pushing the valuation to $3.1 billion, based on $332.1 million in total funding, according to Crunchbase.\n\nEarly investors stand to make out like bandits, with lots of power\n\nAs is the case with many tech unicorns, Cloudflare is offering Class A shares in the IPO, which are currently dwarfed in number by Class B shares, which carry 10 votes compared with the one vote that a Class A share commands.\n\nWhen Cloudflare had its Series A funding round in 2009, Pelion Ventures and Venrock invested a total of $2.1 million in the company. Should Cloudflare\u2019s valuation come in at $3 billion, that would mean about $1 billion for Pelion and Venrock, or about 500 times their original investment. When it comes to voting power, Pelion Ventures has 20.6% of voting shares, and Venrock has 19.1%.\n\nNew Enterprise Associates, which invested $20 million in Series B funding in 2011, controls 22.7% of voting shares, which would come to about $681 million in a $3 billion valuation, or about 34 times the original investment. In 2015, Fidelity Investments put in $110 million in a Series D round for 14.3 million one-vote Class A shares.\n\nIn Cloudflare\u2019s management, Chief Executive and Chairman Matthew Prince controls 19.8% of voting shares, and Chief Operating Officer Michelle Zatlyn controls 6.6% of voting shares.\n\nThe company can\u2019t please everyone\n\nCloudflare dropped 8chan as a customer in August, condemning the unmoderated message board as \u201ca receptive audience for domestic terrorists\u201d following recent mass shootings, and this appears in the company\u2019s \u201crisk factors\u201d section. Cloudflare noted that it was not the first time a customer elicited scrutiny after a violent attack.\n\n\u201cWe also received negative publicity in connection with the use of our network by 8chan, a forum website that served as inspiration for the recent attacks in El Paso, Texas and Christchurch, New Zealand,\u201d Cloudflare said. \u201cWe are aware of some potential customers that have indicated their decision to not subscribe to our products was impacted, at least in part, by the actions of certain of our paying and free customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cConversely, actions we take in response to the activities of our paying and free customers, up to and including banning them from using our products, may harm our brand and reputation,\u201d the company said. \u201cFollowing the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, we terminated the account of The Daily Stormer. Similarly, following the events in El Paso, Texas, we terminated the account of 8chan. We received significant adverse feedback for these decisions from those concerned about our ability to pass judgment on our customers and the users of our platform, or to censor them by limiting their access to our products, and we are aware of potential customers who decided not to subscribe to our products because of this.\u201d", "description": "Cloudflare Inc. is looking to be the next big tech company to go public, and investors who climbed on board a decade ago stand to reap huge rewards.", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP990_cloudf_MG_20190822134128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
