Fight your way through the drone of bureaucratic prose and you\u2019ll discover very specific forecasts for hundreds of energy prices and quantities over the next 30 years. Among its many predictions, this year\u2019s report claims that in 2050 the price of Brent Crude will be $107.94 per barrel.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know whether the authors are doing the bidding of some Matrix-like computer or whether they offer this level of specificity as a kind of inside joke \u2014 is $107.94 more believable than $108? But of course no one takes this faux precision seriously. For lots of fundamental reasons, energy prices are nearly impossible to predict. Economists have a hard time figuring out what\u2019s going to happen next month, let alone in 30 years.\n\nBut the AEO is still worth reading. In fact, the AEO has been spectacularly spot-on about one critical forecast: More than five years ago they predicted that, today, the U.S. would not be fighting a bloody war in the middle of a terrible recession.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey didn\u2019t present it quite so boldly \u2014 they didn\u2019t come right out and say, \u201cWe won\u2019t have a war\u201d \u2014 but that was the intended meaning of their forecast. A few years ago, those faceless economists laboring away in the bureaucratic basements at the Department of Energy came to a realization: They figured out that radical new technologies on both the demand and the supply side would fundamentally alter the American economy by shifting the role that energy plays in it.\n\nEnergy conservation used to mean nagging your kids about turning out the lights. But, as the AEO quite accurately predicted, technology has dramatically reduced energy demand. Our proliferation of microchips and circuit boards isn\u2019t sucking down electricity, fortunately; these devices are telling other energy-powered gizmos how to be more efficient. Your car is basically a computer with an engine. If it weren\u2019t, your fuel mileage would be about 50 percent higher than it is today.\n\nIn part because of massive, tech-enabled improvements in energy efficiency, the 2019 AEO forecasts that between now and 2040, the economy will grow 10 times faster than the demand for energy. (Their models predict that if GDP grows at 1.9 percent per year, energy demand will increase by only 0.2 percent per year.)\n\nOn the supply side, the AEO documented the revolution in how oil and gas is produced. In the oil patch, \u201ctight oil\u201d describes light, sweet crude \u2014 the best kind \u2014 embedded in shale or sandstone. Geologists long suspected such formations were full of oil, but until the fracking revolution, no one knew how to get the valuable substance out. We do now. In 2010, tight oil represented about 15 percent of U.S. production. In 2015, it was slightly over 50 percent, and the AEO predicts it will represent almost two-thirds of oil production by the end of this decade. This is oil and natural gas we otherwise would have bought from foreigners.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with buying things from foreigners \u2014 provided you\u2019re not buying essential stuff from unstable trading partners. Unfortunately, that\u2019s exactly what the U.S. was doing before the technological revolution in energy. In 1973, the U.S. imported over 6 million barrels of oil per day, much of it from the Middle East. When the Yom Kippur War broke out that October, the resulting oil embargo increased prices by almost 400 percent. That was followed by a recession and a ramp-up of political and military involvement in that troubled region.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nContrast that with what happened this past September, when a drone strike on Saudi oil facilities removed almost 6 million barrels per day from world production. In the first full day of trading after the attack, prices went up by about 13 percent. But that was a one-day wonder, and markets quickly figured out that there was plenty of oil sloshing around the world. Prices are now a bit lower than they were a couple of days before the attack.\n\nNone of this means that America is now an energy island in a stormy sea. We should take bipartisan joy in the fact that our scientists and engineers have made us more secure. That said, global energy markets still matter in two crucial ways.\n\nFirst, energy is a globally traded commodity, which means we pay about the same price as everyone else in the world. If something sends world prices soaring, Americans will still have access to domestically produced energy but at a higher price. (There are, by the way, a few ill-informed politicians who want to try to isolate American energy markets by limiting exports. For reasons too complex to explain here, this is a spectacularly bad idea that probably wouldn\u2019t work anyway).\n\nThe second, more important point is that energy is still critical to global economic growth and America is still part of the global economy. American energy independence means that chaos in world energy markets won\u2019t disrupt our access to energy, but a major disruption caused by, say, a war in the Middle East would have a huge impact on important allies and trading partners such as Japan and the European Union. If global energy disruptions send important parts of the world into recession, the U.S. will suffer.\n\nThere\u2019s one more thing about those AEO reports that merit praise: In their own quiet way the mid-level civil servants at the Department of Energy are issuing a bipartisan challenge to the energy ideologues. On the progressive left, many pundits and politicians describe fracking as a kind of uniquely malevolent force without any redeeming social value. On the right, energy conservation is often derided as either a fantasy of tea-sipping, bird-watching environmentalists or a sinister attempt to insert the government into our ordinary lives. The report makes it clear that without fracking and energy conservation, we would never have achieved the energy independence we enjoy today.\n\nMemo to the Department of Energy: Thanks for letting us know.\n\nMichael L.
