REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\n\nDALLAS (Reuters) - The world economy is going through a \u201cfragile\u201d period, but odds of a U.S. recession over the next year remain \u201crelatively low,\u201d Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cGlobal growth is decelerating ... We are in this tenuous period,\u201d Kaplan said, but the United States \u201ccan skate through this\u201d without a downturn given strong consumer spending and a strong job market.\n\n\u201cIf the consumer stays strong, we are not going to have a recession,\u201d Kaplan said in comments to the Dallas Business Club.\n\n\u201cThe thing we are watching is whether decelerating global growth, weak manufacturing in the United States, and weak business fixed investment in the United States \u2013 if that weakness spreads through the rest of the economy, and if it spreads enough so that in six months you see a weak job report or two, and all of a sudden consumer confidence gets a little shaky, then you could have the start of a more severe downturn.\u201d\n\nBut Kaplan said at this point he felt the United States would avoid that outcome.\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates twice this year, most recently last week when the central bank lowered its target rate to a range of between 1.75 percent and 2 percent. Kaplan is not a current voter on interest rate policy but said he supported both moves.\n\nThat has now put monetary policy at a level he considers \u201ca little accommodative,\u201d meaning it should support spending and investment and guard against a slowdown.\n\nKaplan said at this point he is \u201cagnostic\u201d about whether further rate cuts will be needed.", "description": "The world economy is going through a \"fragile\" period, but odds of a U.S. recession over the next year remain \"relatively low,\" Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433950093&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P00C", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
