REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte/File Photo\n\nRelations between Australia and China have deteriorated in recent years amid accusations that Beijing is meddling in domestic affairs and Australian fears that China is seeking undue influence in the Pacific region.\n\nAustralian lawmakers had sought to improve the relationship by refraining from public criticism of China in recent months but Peter Dutton, the minister for home affairs, said Australia would not be silent despite the importance of their trading relationship.\n\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth more than A$180 billion ($122 billion) last year.\n\n\u201cWe have a very important trading relationship with China \u2013 incredibly important,\u201d Dutton told reporters in Canberra.\n\n\u201cBut we are not going to allow university students to be unduly influenced, we are not going to allow theft of intellectual property, and we are not going to allow our government bodies or non-government bodies to be hacked into,\u201d he said.\n\nChina\u2019s embassy in Canberra did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Beijing has previously denied any improper activities, accusing Australia of adopting a \u201cCold War mentality\u201d.\n\nReuters reported earlier this month that Australian intelligence had determined China was responsible for a cyber-attack on the national parliament and three largest political parties before a general election in May, according to five people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry denied involvement in any hacking attacks and said the internet was full of theories that were hard to trace.\n\nThe attack on Australia\u2019s parliament and political parties came as hackers were also targeting the country\u2019s most prestigious university, an official report by the Australian National University (ANU) showed, which stoked fears that China could influence research and students.\n\nThe ANU said last week its investigators were unable to identify who was responsible for the cyber-attack earlier this year.\n\nForeign students are worth about A$35 billion a year to the Australian economy, with Chinese students accounting for about a third of that figure.\n\nAustralian universities are financially dependent on overseas students, raising fears that foreign governments could exert undue influence.\n\nAs a result, Australian universities will now be required to work with security agencies to ensure they guard against undue foreign interference.", "description": "China is behaving in a way that is inconsistent with Australian values by targeting political parties and universities in Australia, a senior government minister said on Friday in comments that threaten to further inflame bilateral tensions.", "authors": ["Colin Packham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439582875&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0GD", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
