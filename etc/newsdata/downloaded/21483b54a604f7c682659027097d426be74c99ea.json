These labels tend to be more about food quality, not safety,\u201d said Elise Springuel, program coordinator at Food Link, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that redistributes unsold food to low-income households.\n\n\u201cSo many different labels contribute to the confusion, which means people are often hesitant are try food that is still perfectly good,\u201d Ms. Springuel told The Washington Times.\n\nRecent years have seen increasing pressure on the FDA, the USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency to better address the country\u2019s food waste problem.\n\nRecent reports by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the National Institutes of Health and environmental advocacy groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council have documented the amount of edible food that ends up in U.S. landfills.\n\nThe estimate of 130 billion pounds of food annually wasted comes from a 2014 USDA study and a 2017 report by the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nAlthough the USDA and the EPA in 2015 agreed to work together to cut food waste in half by 2030 (the FDA joined the effort in 2018), a GAO report released in June blasted the agencies for making little headway, especially in terms of setting common goals.\n\nThat report also underscored the expiration labeling problem but also noted that the FDA was backing food industry efforts to standardize expiration labeling.\n\nLast May, the FDA announced it was supporting the standardized use of \u201cBest If Used By\u201d \u2014 which the Grocery Manufacturers Association also endorsed.\n\nIn a response to the GAO\u2019s latest report, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue wrote that food labels were one of six \u201cpriority actions\u201d the agency is pursuing.\n\nLast month, Reps. Chellie Pingree, Maine Democrat, and Dan Newhouse, Washington Republican, introduced legislation aimed at standardizing date labels. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat, introduced a Senate companion bill.\n\n\u201cWith this piece of legislation, we can help ensure food is being used and eaten, rather than thrown out due to confusion,\u201d Ms. Pingree said in a statement.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
