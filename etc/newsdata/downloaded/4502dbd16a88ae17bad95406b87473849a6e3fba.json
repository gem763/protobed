We saw against the United States that if we are not at our best for 80 minutes we could pay a heavy price.\"\n\nOnly four players - centre Sofiane Guitoune, hooker Camille Chat, lock Paul Gabrillagues and wing Alivereti Raka - remain from the side struggled for most of their match against the USA.\n\nThey were only ahead 12-9 with 15 minutes to play before a late rally blew the score out to 33-9.\n\nAgainst Argentina they led 20-3 before falling behind and needed a late drop goal to win 23-21.\n\n\"We're unbeaten but we haven't exactly set the world alight,\" said coach Jacques Brunel.\n\n\"Tonga play with a lot of force, they are very aggressive and enterprising. It's a big challenge.\"\n\nThree members of the current French squad and two Tongans played in the classic battle eight years ago.\n\nMaxime Medard, who starts at fullback on Sunday, as well as Guirado and Picamoles played for France, with Ntamack's father Emile the assistant coach. Flank Sione Kalamafoni and centre Siale Piutau turned out for Tonga.\n\n\"It was probably the best win of my career,\" said Piutau, now Tonga's captain, adding it also helped to have six members of his match-day 23 based in France.\n\n\"They understand the mindset and psyche of French players. when we beat them in 2011 we had a lot of players who played alongside the French boys and it's definitely a benefit for us.\"\n\nFrance and Tonga both lost two pool matches in 2011, but France progressed because of superior bonus points and they went all the way to the final, where they were beaten 8-7 by New Zealand.", "description": "France go into their clash with Tonga looking to produce a dominant performance that will keep them on track for a Rugby World Cup quarter-final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8457/8a7726f54cae4e059ef6cfca003868be.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
