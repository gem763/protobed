He successfully convinced several prestigious, peer-reviewed journals to publish articles which were anything but scholarly. In one, he analyzed \u201cdog rape culture,\u201d in another, he republished portions of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf, spruced up with academic buzzwords.\n\nThis may sound like an off-color prank, but it was a serious effort to expose a grave problem on college campuses. Boghossian\u2019s hypothesis was simple: the leftist fixation on intersectionality and what he termed \u201cgrievance studies\u201d have led to a sharp decline in the quality and rigor of scholarship within the discipline.\n\nBoghossian and his two colleagues, Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsey, made headlines in 2018 for completing an investigation into how lax some humanities journals had become.\n\nThe trio wrote and submitted twenty \u201choax\u201d articles to several prominent academic journals in various academic fields, including gender and queer studies, that the researchers felt were most influenced by progressive ideology rather than objective research.\n\nWhen seven of their \u201cfake\u201d studies were published after undergoing the purportedly-scrupulous \u201cpeer-review\u201d process, Boghossian and his team released a report demonstrating how ideologically-driven academia has become. It brings to mind the \u201cSokal hoax\u201d of the mid-90s, when a New York University physicist submitted a similarly \u201cfake\u201d study which also ended up being published.\n\nPSU\u2019s Internal Review Board then sanctioned Boghossian for \u201cfabricating data and studying human subjects, specifically the various journal editors, without their consent.\u201d\n\nThe Internal Review Board seems to have missed the purpose of the professor\u2019s study.\n\nThe censure led directly to the ban Boghossian now faces. The academy seems more interested in making an example of him than acknowledging the concern about a lack of quality control in the field of \u201cgrievance studies,\u201d which his efforts unveiled.\n\nIt is not as if citizens are unaware of the issues plaguing higher education.\n\nFrom the oft-referenced replication crisis in the social sciences (wherein academic studies cannot be reproduced by unaffiliated researchers), the insane cost of college, and the liberal bent of a staggering percentage of university professors, many students would do well to reconsider the value of attending college over trade schools or other similar, skill-developing opportunities.\n\nBoghossian\u2019s study revealed the dangerous road that academia is sprinting down. He cited \u201cconstructivism\u201d\u2013the idea that truth is temporally and culturally situated\u2013as the main culprit infecting academic research, especially within the humanities.\n\nThe research team noted that \u201cradical constructivists tend to believe science and reason must be dismantled to let \u2018other ways of knowing\u2019 have equal validation as knowledge-producing enterprises.\u201d This idea could be what is driving many academic journals down the ideological rabbit hole.\n\nAs Boghossian and his team stated in their study, \u201cAs we progressed, we started to realize that just about anything can be made to work, so long as it falls within the moral orthodoxy and demonstrates understanding of existing literature.\u201d\n\nScholars across the world agreed with the authors\u2019 motives and conclusions, and wrote to PSU\u2019s vice president for research administration in support of Boghossian. Even Alan Sokal, the NYU scientist who got into hot water for his similar effort in 1996, defended the beleaguered Portland professor, writing:\n\nIt seems to me that it would be a grave injustice to punish Professor Boghossian for a violation of the letter of the [Research Misconduct Policy] that did not constitute in any way a violation of that policy\u2019s purpose and which moreover was undertaken with the goal of serving, and which did, in fact, serve the public interest\u2026\n\nUnfortunately, but unsurprisingly given the university administration\u2019s reaction, many of Boghossian\u2019s fellow professors at PSU were not as supportive. In an anonymous letter to the editor in the university\u2019s newspaper, the anti-Boghossian group wrote:\n\n[T]he \u2018hoaxes\u2019 are simply lies peddled to journals, masquerading as articles. \u2026 Chronic and pathological, unscholarly behavior inside an institution of higher education brings negative publicity to the institution as well as the honest scholars who work there. Worse yet, it jeopardizes the students\u2019 reputations, as their degrees in the process may become devalued.\n\nBoghossian\u2019s aggrieved colleagues seem to have missed the entire point of his study, and may prefer for their students to learn from such indoctrination.\n\nChristina Hoff Summers, noted scholar and critic of modern feminism, described Boghossian\u2019s hoax project as an \u201ceye-opening experiment,\u201d the results of which \u201craise serious questions about the methods of several seemingly legitimate academic journals.\u201d\n\nShe went on, according to Campus Reform, to \u201caddress the accusation of improperly studying human subjects, saying \u2018This charge is hard to take seriously. By its very nature, the parody rules out the possibility of consent: It is the view of the [Internal Review Board] that academic journals should be shielded from critical or irreverent scrutiny?\u201d\n\nPSU stated in its disciplinary letter that it is willing to give Boghossian another chance to conduct research, if he completes a required \u201cprotection of human subjects training\u201d course and otherwise satisfies the university\u2019s administration.\n\nHowever, for a non-tenured professor who himself acknowledges he does not \u201cfit the mold\u201d of the \u201cideological community\u201d on campus, the odds of him being permitted to resume his research may be slim.\n\nBoghossian\u2019s experiment highlights the problems of groupthink in any environment, especially academia.\n\nIf humanities professors are going to be more interested in placating popular opinion rather than exposing shoddy academic practices bordering on charlatanry, then we should stop describing our humanities\u2019 departments as bastions of truth.\n\nTruth is objective, not subject to the prevailing winds of academia and the left at large.\n\nStifling academic debate, exercising a heckler\u2019s veto over messages that do not fit within an ideology prescribed by liberal academics, and promoting shoddy \u201cresearch\u201d that supports that ideology, will not advance the search for truth, which should be the ultimate goal of any serious academic institution.\n\nAll it will do is perpetuate irrationality and ignorance.", "description": "Evidence is mounting that political ideology is corrupting the liberal arts.\n\nAccording to Campus Reform, in late July, Portland State University\u00a0accused\u00a0one of its professors, Peter Boghossian, of \u201c\u2018questionable ethical behavior\u2019 and banned him from conducting academic research.\u201d", "authors": ["Jason Snead", "Commentary By", "Senior Policy Analyst", "Summer Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation", "Administrative", "Research Assistant", "Meese Center"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-500765051.jpg?itok=mEOEWFOH"}
