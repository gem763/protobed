(Justin Lane/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nThe now-famous phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s inexperienced new president has upended politics in the United States.\n\nHere, not so much.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, the popular former television comedian who took office in May, has gotten a pass so far from most of Ukraine\u2019s political establishment over a rough White House transcript of the getting-to-know-you phone call in which Trump proposed he open a criminal investigation against the son of one of his rivals.\n\nIt might not say much for his adherence to the rule of law that he appeared amenable to the suggestion, analysts say. But in Ukraine, it\u2019s hardly shocking. And, importantly, he hasn\u2019t actually done anything about it since he hung up the phone.\n\n\u201cThis scandal is not affecting Ukrainian politics at all,\u201d said Sviatoslav Yurash, a Zelensky ally in the Rada, or parliament. \u201cAmerican politics isn\u2019t on top of the agenda.\u201d\n\nBut some members of the Rada appear ready to turn up the heat. Prominent among them is Oleksiy Honcharenko, a member of former president Petro Poroshenko\u2019s party. Honcharenko told The Washington Post on Sunday that \u201csources\u201d within the government have told him Ukraine has both a transcript and an audio recording of the call \u2014 and he plans to ask Zelensky to release them.\n\nThe chances of that happening are slim, which raises the possibility that Honcharenko is merely trolling. He said he plans to hold an informal hearing later this week.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing a stunt,\u201d Yurash said. \u201cSome people like that.\u201d\n\n[In U.S.-Ukraine dealings, Russia is never far away]\n\nThe president\u2019s press secretary, Yulia Mendel, declined to comment on the existence of a record of the call.\n\nHoncharenko said he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in the transcript or tape, if either exists, but he thinks what\u2019s known so far about the phone call is bad enough.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who was preparing [Zelensky] for this conversation,\u201d he said, \u201cbut 100 percent they made a mistake.\u201d\n\nHe said Zelensky should have deflected Trump\u2019s suggestion that he investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter and returned to issues that are actually important to Ukraine, such as military aid, sanctions on Russia and the effort to arrange a settlement in the breakaway regions in the east. He should not have agreed with Trump\u2019s criticism of Western European leaders, on whose goodwill Ukraine depends.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re a part of American elections, and I don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cUkraine has problems enough without this.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced an impeachment inquiry, stemming from the disclosure of the phone call.\n\nAnother member of parliament, Alyona Shkrum, argued that the scandal really dates to Poroshenko\u2019s presidency, when Rudolph W. Giuliani began meeting with Ukranian prosecutors and making inquiries about the Bidens. She said Zelensky shouldn\u2019t be blamed for it.\n\nStill, she said, the affair has put Ukraine into \u201ca whirlpool.\u201d She warned that the country, which has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress in its conflict with Russia, could manage to alienate both Democrats and Republicans if it isn\u2019t careful in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nUkraine needs to take the high road, she said, and show that it\u2019s doing so. \u201cWe need to prosecute people according to our laws, and not according to the political benefit of a person in another country.\u201d\n\n[Ukrainian lawmakers seek new probes into allegations at \u2018epicenter\u2019 of U.S. political battles]\n\nYurash defends Zelensky. It was a get-acquainted phone call, he said, and nothing in the conversation was \u201cthat bad.\u201d Zelensky wanted to establish a rapport with the leader of a country that has the most powerful military and biggest economy in the world.\n\n\u201cBoth are flattering each other, trying to make a good impression. Is that a criminal offense? No, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Yurash said. \u201cOf course he has spent the time talking about key issues that Trump wanted to raise and raising his own issues. Whether he was pristine in everything he said, well, obviously not.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, he said, Zelensky is determined to move Ukraine toward the rule of law.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine, that\u2019s the biggest question: How do you battle corruption, and whether you are effective in battling corruption.\u201d\n\nThe press here has focused on the implications for the rule of law, asked how independent Zelensky will be from U.S. influence, and explored what Zelensky\u2019s responses to Trump mean for relations with Western European countries.\n\n\u201cUkraine, in this situation, once again is not a subject, but an object,\u201d wrote Yulia Mostovaya, one of Kiev\u2019s leading journalists, and the wife of an unsuccessful presidential candidate, Anatoliy Hrytsenko. \u201cUsing the fears and ambitions of Ukrainian politicians, both Democrats and Republicans turned them into clubs for their domestic political golf.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a leak here revealed secret payments to Paul Manafort, then Trump\u2019s campaign manager. Now, Republicans have been pushing Ukrainian prosecutors to pursue the Bidens.\n\n\u201cMaintaining support from both American parties is critical to Ukraine,\u201d Mostovaya wrote in Zerkalo Nedeli, or Mirror of the Week. \u201cAnd not only because today no one can predict the outcome of the 2020 U.S. elections.\u201d Ukraine needs friends in both the White House and Congress.\n\nThe Rada is scheduled to take up next year\u2019s budget this week, and turn to the contentious issue of land reform \u2014 subjects more relevant to most people here.\n\n\u201cUkrainians don\u2019t get the essence of the [phone call], who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Konstantin Batozky, a political analyst. \u201cWe\u2019re not the ones who published the account. It\u2019s America.\u201d\n\nAnd Zelensky is still enjoying a honeymoon with the voters, Honcharenko said with a sigh. A request by Trump to bring political pressure on a prosecutor? \u201cPeople didn\u2019t hear something that\u2019s unbelievable to them,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more\n\nFormer Ukraine prosecutor says Hunter Biden \u2018did not violate anything\u2019\n\nIn gambit for Trump, Giuliani engaged parade of Ukrainian prosecutors\n\nUkraine isn\u2019t Washington\u2019s top priority, but it\u2019s sparking another Washington scandal\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "One member of parliament wants to know: Is there a tape of that conversation?", "authors": ["Will Englund", "Assignment Editor On The Washington Post'S Foreign Desk", "A Veteran Moscow Correspondent", "Natalie Gryvnyak", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ujmxJl2eirbGYkOVWW-QzWwYbII=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MS6HF5HC4AI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
