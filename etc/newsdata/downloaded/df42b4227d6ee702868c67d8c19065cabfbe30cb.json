Then Bill Clinton became president, and his behavior exemplified neither.\n\nIn 1998 he was impeached by a partisan G.O.P. House. But he survived the drama \u2014 and could have easily been re-elected to a third term absent the 22nd Amendment \u2014 for three reasons. His opponents overreached. The country was doing fine. And his supporters could be remarkably creative or brazen (when they weren\u2019t simply mute) in excusing behavior they would never have tolerated from a Republican.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to think of that episode now that the shoe is on the other foot.\n\nFirst, about the overreach: In 1998, Republicans didn\u2019t merely oppose Clinton and his policies. They hated him, every bit as much as Democrats hate Donald Trump. Right-wing radio was then about as influential as left-wing Twitter is today, and it generated the same kind of visceral and obsessive passion.\n\nClinton hatred played itself out in the interminable Whitewater investigation, which uncovered some wrongdoing and questionable dealings while inuring much of the country to murky presidential scandals. Think of it as the forerunner to the Mueller inquest.", "description": "Can Democrats and Republicans learn from the mistakes of 1998?", "authors": ["Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/opinion/04stephensWeb/04stephensWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
