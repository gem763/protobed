The norovirus is a contagious virus that causes gastrointestinal illnesses. It's most commonly associated with contaminated food, but can also be transmitted from one person to another and it can even be spread through the air when an infected person vomits or flushes a toilet. Although it is not related to influenza, it is sometimes referred to as a 'stomach flu.' According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year an estimated 20 million Americans become infected with the virus, leading to approximately 800 deaths.
