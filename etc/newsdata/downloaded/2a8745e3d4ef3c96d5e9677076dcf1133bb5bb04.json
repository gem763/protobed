Researchers have uncovered a number of Android apps filled with adware, which have been downloaded about eight million times in total. Here are the offending apps and how to remove them.\n\nHow Can You Tell If An App Is Malware? There are a lot of apps you can download on Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store. That\u2019s obvious. What\u2019s not so obvious is that even though both companies do a pretty good job of (mostly) catching bullshit apps, there are still plenty that sneak through because they just toe the line between scammy and barely helpful. Read more\n\nResearchers at ESET have detected 42 apps on the Google Play Store belonging to the same adware campaign. At the time of discovery, half of those apps were still available but the ESET researchers reported the detected apps to Google and they've since been deleted.\n\nThe research outlines that while the apps do function how they advertised, they also contain adware, which allows the apps to pop ads up in other apps such as Facebook and Messenger. The offending apps included Smart Gallery, DU Recorder, Free Radio FM, Heroes Jump, Water Drink Reminder and SavelInsta.\n\nImage: ESET\n\nThe apps make up a family which ESET researchers call Android/AdDisplay.Ashas. They all work the same way in that once the app is opened, it sends data about your phone to the offender's server. That data includes device type, OS version, language, number of installed apps, free storage space, battery status and whether you have the Facebook and Messenger apps installed. It then determines how and where to place ads on your device.\n\nThe following packages are included:\n\ncom.ngocph.masterfree\n\ncom.mghstudio.ringtonemaker\n\ncom.hunghh.instadownloader\n\ncom.chungit.tank1990\n\ncom.video.downloadmasterfree\n\ncom.massapp.instadownloader\n\ncom.chungit.tankbattle\n\ncom.chungit.basketball\n\ncom.applecat.worldchampion2018\n\norg.minigamehouse.photoalbum\n\ncom.mngh.tuanvn.fbvideodownloader\n\ncom.v2social.socialdownloader\n\ncom.hikeforig.hashtag\n\ncom.chungit.heroesjump\n\ncom.mp4.video.downloader\n\ncom.videotomp4.downloader\n\nboxs.puzzles.Puzzlebox\n\ncom.intatwitfb.download.videodownloader\n\ncom.doscreenrecorder.screenrecorder\n\ncom.toptools.allvideodownloader\n\ncom.top1.videodownloader\n\ncom.santastudio.headsoccer2\n\ncom.ringtonemakerpro.ringtonemakerapp2019\n\ncom.hugofq.solucionariodebaldor\n\ncom.anit.bouncingball\n\ncom.dktools.liteforfb\n\nnet.radiogroup.tvnradio\n\ncom.anit.bouncingball\n\ncom.floating.tube.bymuicv\n\norg.cocos2dx.SpiderSolitaireGames\n\ngames.puzzle.crosssum\n\ndots.yellow.craft\n\ncom.tvngroup.ankina.reminderWater\n\ncom.hdevs.ringtonemaker2019\n\ncom.carlosapps.solucionariodebaldor\n\ncom.mngh1.flatmusic\n\ncom.tvn.app.smartnote\n\ncom.thrtop.alldownloader\n\ncom.anthu91.soccercard\n\ncom.hugofq.wismichudosmildiecisiete\n\ncom.gamebasketball.basketballperfectshot\n\ncom.nteam.solitairefree\n\ncom.instafollowers.hiketop\n\nWhat should I do if I've got one installed?\n\nThe best thing to do is to just delete it. Adware won't necessarily steal all your money like malware but it can annoy users, drain their device's battery and still gather sensitive personal information.\n\nMalware fatigue is likely setting in for some as another alert is issued for Android devices. While it's easy to brush the news aside, it's good to be mindful of the commonly-uttered phrase: If you don't pay for the product, you are the product.\n\nWatch Out For This Battery-Draining Android Bug Google Assistant has been crowned the smartest digital phone assistant many times over. But it turns out there's one thing it's not particularly great at: switching itself off to prevent screen burn-in. Yikes. Here's what causes the bug and how to fix it.
