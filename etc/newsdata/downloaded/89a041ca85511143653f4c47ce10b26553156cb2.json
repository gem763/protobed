According to Karpf, it initially received nine likes and zero retweets. And he did not tag Stephens in it. Nevertheless, Karpf soon received a complaining email from Stephens in which the columnist berated the professor for setting a new low for online discourse. In an interview with MSNBC, Stephens later claimed that the bedbug tweet was an example of \"dehumanizing\" rhetoric that called to mind various totalitarian regimes likening their enemies to insects.\n\n.@BretStephensNYT on quitting Twitter after being called a \"bedbug\": \"Analogizing people to insects is always wrong \u2026 Being analogized to insects goes back to a lot of totalitarian regimes in the past.\" pic.twitter.com/Iyh9PpK2HS \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) August 27, 2019\n\nStephens' complaining email was not just addressed to Karpf. He also copied the offices of George Washington University Provost Forrest Maltzman. In other words, Stephens complained to Karpf's boss. This is stunning hypocrisy from Stephens. In a May 17 Times op-ed, Stephens\u2014who regularly inveighs against political correctness run amok on college campuses and elsewhere\u2014castigated \"all those who recklessly participate in the search-and-destroy missions of the call-out culture.\" Stephens specifically criticized students at Harvard, Middlebury, and Yale for \"alleging an invisible harm in order to inflict an actual one.\"\n\n\"In place of an eye for an eye, we have professional destruction for emotional upset,\" wrote Stephens. \"Careers and reputations built over decades come to ruin, or nearly so, on account of a personal mistake or a disfavored opinion.\"\n\nYet Stephens is now engaged in exactly the same kind of attempted canceling of Karpf.\n\nTo be sure, Stephens maintains that he had no desire to get Karpf in any trouble. But, as Stephens well knows, inviting university administrators to take a hard look at students and professors who said or did something controversial is a dangerous game. Administrators routinely engage in censorship as part of their efforts to placate squeaky wheels.\n\nI've often enjoyed Stephens' work, and I agree with him that many young people are all-too-eager to destroy people for venial sins. (In fact, I wrote an entire book on this subject!) But informing the provost was a lapse in judgment.\n\nBret Stephens is not a bedbug. But he might be a delicate snowflake.\n\nProvost Maltzman released the following statement Tuesday afternoon affirming Karpf's right to academic freedom.", "description": "The New York Times columnist emailed a professor to complain about a mean tweet\u2014and cc'ed the provost.", "authors": ["Ira Stoll", "David Bernstein", "Billy Binion", "Matt Welch", "Cathy Young", "Jacob Sullum", "C.J.
