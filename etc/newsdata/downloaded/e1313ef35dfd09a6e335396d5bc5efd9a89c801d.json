As the one-year anniversary of Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue attack approaches, and an anti-Semitic shooting in Germany on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar focuses attention anew on the rising tide of global hate crimes against the faith, Jewish and Muslim groups in the U.S. are forging durable alliances in pushing back against crimes targeting their respective communities. (AP Photo/Mel Evans)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Muslim groups helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to help Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue recover after a gunman killed 11 people there, one year ago this week. The Jewish congregation mounted its own fundraiser for New Zealand's Muslims after a white supremacist shooter killed 51 people at two mosques there in March.\n\nSuch outreach between Jews and Muslims often draws widespread attention only in the immediate wake of tragedy. But as both faiths grapple with a rise in reported hate crimes and fears within their communities of being attacked for their beliefs, Jews and Muslims are forging bonds that rely on shared personal values to help combat anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\nFor Sheryl Olitzky, 63, the \"aha moment\" that inspired her focus on Jewish-Muslim connections came almost a decade ago on a trip to Poland, when she asked a guide why she saw no locals in the head-covering garb of devout members of either faith.\n\nOlitzky, who was married at Tree of Life synagogue, recalled being stunned by the exclusionary response she heard and telling herself that \"I could not change history, but I could rewrite it by changing the future\" and working to prevent further episodes of discrimination against Jews and Muslims.\n\nWhen the grandmother of seven returned home to New Jersey, however, it took several months for her to realize that, despite living in an area with \"a fairly substantial number of Muslims and Jews,\" she had no Muslim friends.\n\n\"I said, 'I believe ignorance is a primary driver of hate, and it's time, if I want to make change that I get to know Muslim women',\" Olitzky said.\n\nWhen Olitzky was introduced to Atiya Aftab, a Muslim attorney and adjunct professor at Rutgers University, their partnership took off as the nonprofit Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom. What began as a meeting of six Muslim and six Jewish women at Atfab's home now counts more than 170 chapters in 32 states and Canada, according to Olitzky.\n\nThe Sisterhood devotes much of its attention to education and shared experiences that can deepen ties between its members, with its fourth annual trip this year taking dozens of Muslim and Jewish women and teenage girls to Germany and Poland. But a vow to fight hate crimes that target their respective communities is also woven into the group's foundation, with a \"rise and respond\" primer for speaking out against anti-Semitism and Islamophobia released this year .\n\nOther members of the two faiths have created formal alliances as well. The Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council was established by the American Jewish Committee and the Islamic Society of North America in the first days after President Donald Trump's 2016 election \u2014 following a campaign where Trump repeatedly stoked public fears of Muslims.\n\nMJAC is co-chaired by two business executives, one Jewish and one Muslim. The group opened regional affiliates after a 2017 spike in reported hate crimes that included the death of Heather Heyer, killed while demonstrating against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nAJC Director of U.S. Muslim-Jewish Relations Ari Gordon said that some themes common in episodes of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are \"definitely linked.\" The same man who allegedly attacked a synagogue in Poway, Calif., this spring was also linked to a fire set at a nearby California mosque, Gordon pointed out.\n\nHate crimes reported to the FBI have risen for three years running, according to official statistics, with Jews and Muslims ranking as the top two targets of religiously motivated incidents. But underreporting is seen as a significant obstacle to effective tracking of the problem. Heyer's death, for example, was not included in the federal database although the man who drove his car into the crowd where she stood pleaded guilty to hate crimes charges.\n\nMJAC has championed bipartisan legislation in Congress designed to improve the tracking of hate crimes \u2014 but its work has stayed in that domestic policy lane, steering clear of U.S. policy toward the Israel-Palestine conflict that has been a longtime divider of Jews and Muslims.\n\n\"We don't put that issue on the side because it's not important; quite the opposite,\" Gordon said, adding that MJAC aims to demonstrate that the two faiths \"can work together for mutual benefit and build trust despite this disagreement.\"", "description": "Muslim groups helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to help Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue recover after a gunman killed 11 people there, one year ago this week.
