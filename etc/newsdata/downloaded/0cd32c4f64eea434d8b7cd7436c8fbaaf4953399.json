In Scent Memories, the Cut asks people about the scents they associate with different times in their lives.\n\nNext up is Dior\u2019s master perfumer, Fran\u00e7ois Demachy, creator of the new scent Joy by Dior Eau de Parfum Intense, an ode to the concept of light. The Cut caught up with Demachy to talk about the smell of the passage of time, ephemeral happiness, and the scent he made for himself.\n\nMy first scent memory is: My mother, for sure. My mother liked to wear two perfumes. One was Chanel No. 5 and the other was Miss Dior. I spent 20 years at Chanel and now I\u2019m at Dior, so it\u2019s very funny. My mother was a pharmacist. I remember her selling a suntan lotion and an eau de cologne. I remember smelling the samples of the cologne with my mother.\n\nHappiness smells like: Happiness or joy is linked to light. Just look outside! In many religions, you can find the association between light and joy. Joy is ultimately subjective, and not the same for everyone, but light is universal. I think of notes which by their very essence are linked to light, like roses and neroli.\n\nFriendship smells like: There is an expression in French that when you don\u2019t like someone, we say we can\u2019t smell them. It also means, we can\u2019t stand them. Some people will never smell bad to you.\n\nRegret smells like: It\u2019s about the passing of time. The smells that evoke regret are old-fashioned, like carnations. They\u2019re ones which aren\u2019t used very often anymore.\n\nSuccess smells like: Champagne. Not only because of its smell, but because of the quality of it. It\u2019s bubbly \u2014 it\u2019s as ephemeral as success.\n\nVacation smells like: When we make perfume, we think about how smell affects your brain and memory. To remind you of a sunny day, we use raw materials like coconut which are in suntan products. Your brain remembers. For me, I think of suntan and salt.\n\nA pleasant surprise smells like: I can\u2019t put my finger on one specific thing. I think a posy of flowers, filled with roses, rather than a jasmine which is more fleshy and sensual. Maybe the centifolia rose is too serious, so it would be some damascena roses.\n\nThe worst smell is: I don\u2019t like the smell of cumin. I know that it\u2019s good sometimes in perfume, but it\u2019s quite difficult for me to use. Otherwise, I don\u2019t like the smell of a plucked chicken. After you pluck the chicken, you put the chicken on a spit. The smell of the burning flesh is unbearable.\n\nSunday morning smells like: Time. We take our time to do things. For breakfast, I take time to linger. If I were to make a perfume based on this idea, I would use orange blossom. It\u2019s already in cosmetics, so it evokes the time we take for ourselves.\n\nMonday morning smells like: Eau de cologne. I use a special cologne I made just for me. Since I\u2019m a perfumer, I don\u2019t want smells I put on myself to stay too long on my skin. It\u2019s very simple, and relaxed. I made it without any musk, so it stays on the skin one hour and then it disappears.\n\nI smell like: My scent smells like bergamot, lemon, bitter orange, and also grapefruit. I love grapefruit \u2014 it\u2019s something between citrus-y and also very sour. It helps me to wake up in the morning.\n\nJOY BY DIOR Eau de parfum intense $100 at Dior Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Talking about scents, fragrances, and the connection between smells and memories with Francois Demachy, Dior\u2019s Master Perfumer.", "authors": ["Kathleen Hou"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/16/16-scent-memories.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
