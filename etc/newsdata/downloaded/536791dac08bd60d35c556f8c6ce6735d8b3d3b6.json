Trump\u2019s request is part of a secret whistleblower complaint in the intelligence community that is said to involve Trump making an unspecified commitment to a foreign leader, according to two people familiar with the complaint.\n\nThe sharp accusations between Trump and Biden elevated the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as a potentially significant new issue in the presidential race, and offered voters a preview of what is likely to be an extraordinary general election contest if Biden were to win the nomination.\n\nThe controversy has focused on whether Trump manipulated foreign policy \u2014 a military aid package to Ukraine had been delayed at the time of the phone call \u2014 to pressure the country\u2019s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to take action to damage Biden\u2019s election bid.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump sought to deflect attention from that question by accusing Biden of acting improperly as vice president in calling for the ouster of a Ukranian prosecutor who had overseen an inquiry into corruption related to the oligarch whose company employed Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump described his conversation with Zelenskiy as \u201cperfectly fine and routine.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone \u2018bust\u2019 on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign.\n\nIntensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, Trump said the real problem was Biden and questions about what the president described as \u201cthe Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son.\u201d\n\nReferring to his conversation with Zelenskiy, Trump said: \u201cNothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster.\u201d\n\nNo evidence has surfaced to support Trump\u2019s claim that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general\u2019s dismissal. But some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine could complicate his father\u2019s diplomacy there.\n\nThe issue strikes a particular nerve for Biden, who has long feared putting his family under the harsh spotlight of a presidential campaign. During a two-minute encounter with reporters on Saturday morning, he grew irate, angrily insisting that he had never spoken with his son about any overseas work.\n\n\u201cYou should be looking at Trump,\u201d Biden said. \u201cTrump is doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nEven as they avoided mentioning Biden, other Democratic presidential candidates moved quickly to capitalize on the new dynamic in the race. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who rarely mentions Trump in her stump speech, opened her remarks at a cattle call on Saturday afternoon by excoriating both the president and congressional Democrats.\n\n\u201cHe has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,\u201d she told a crowd of 1,200 cheering Democratic voters gathered in Des Moines for an afternoon of primary speeches. \u201cIt is time to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now.\u201d", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Allegations that President Donald Trump courted foreign interference from Ukraine to hurt his leading Democratic rival, Joe Biden, dominated presidential politics Saturday, as Biden demanded a House investigation of Trump's phone call in July with Ukraine's leader and as Trump", "authors": ["Lisa Lerer", "Reid J.
