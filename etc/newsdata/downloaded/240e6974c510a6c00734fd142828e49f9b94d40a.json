He ran the person\u2019s identity through databases and found out there was an administrative warrant from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement asking he be held for pickup by deportation officers.\n\nThe police officer then checked the warrant in a county database, saw it was valid, and called the deportation officer, who said he could respond quickly and take custody.\n\nFairfax Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler Jr. said that violated county police policy, which is not to check on administrative warrants, almost all of which are from ICE. Chief Roessler on Tuesday said he was suspending the officer, though after an outcry he reversed the decision Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have one of the best police forces in the U.S. and I have confidence that our officer will represent us well throughout his career,\u201d the chief said in a statement.\n\nThat was a major departure from the day before, when the chief said the officer had \u201cdeprived a person of their freedom, which is unacceptable.\u201d He also said the officer had harmed the image of Fairfax within the community.\n\nThe whiplash responses could leave the chief open to lawsuits from all sides, analysts said.\n\nChief Roessler\u2019s statement that the illegal immigrant was \u201cdeprived\u201d of freedom suggests a civil rights violation, which could lead to a lawsuit.\n\nBut the chief\u2019s reversal suggests the county will defend the officer\u2019s actions as following up on a valid warrant, thus poking a hole in the reasons for the suspension.\n\nSheriff Jenkins in Culpeper recently fought a legal battle over detaining illegal immigrants for ICE to pick up, and won the case. He said that provides legal backing for any Virginia department that wants to cooperate with ICE detainers.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t know Chief Roessler and considers the Fairfax Police, with whom he\u2019s worked for years, a great agency. He also said he understands the bounds of policy.\n\nBut in this instance the officer\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t deserve punishment.\n\n\u201cThis is a street level situation where you literally have an [ICE] agent who says \u2018I\u2019m on the way, can you hold him?\u2019 That certainly meets the reasonableness standard,\u201d Sheriff Jenkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a legal issue, it\u2019s a policy issue in this situation. \u2026 I would always look at the officer\u2019s position and say was he trying to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
