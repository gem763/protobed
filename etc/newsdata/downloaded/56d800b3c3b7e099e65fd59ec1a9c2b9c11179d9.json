Perhaps Pelosi will schedule a vote on USMCA this year, but that strikes us as a political bridge too far...ratify Trump's signature trade achievement while calling for his impeachment?\n\nKrueger notes that the outlook for the other major piece of potential legislation \u2014 a bill to lower prescription drug prices \u2014 is similar to that of Trump\u2019s trade deal with Mexico and Canada. \u201cIf you believe in the second interpretation (Pelosi will pass at least one thing for her vulnerable members), drug pricing could get done,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut we are very skeptical.\u201d\n\nLike what you're reading?
