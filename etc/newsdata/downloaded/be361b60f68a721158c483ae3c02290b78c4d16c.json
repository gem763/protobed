The hosts played with the flair and verve that have been a highlight of this tournament, but they were eventually crushed by the power of the Springboks up front and in the tackle.\n\nJapan v South Africa: Rugby World Cup 2019, quarter-final \u2013 live! Read more\n\nIt was, though, a player who would be considered small even by Japanese standards who stood out throughout, the scrum-half Faf de Klerk, whose defensive awareness in the opening half when Japan dominated possession, precise box-kicking and opportunism in attack took the Springboks one step closer to the final they covet.\n\nThe first half was a captivating contrast between the frenzied movement of a Japan side that swarmed around the field and the strong green line that kept its shape, thundered into tackles and looked to feed off mistakes.\n\nAfter 30 minutes, South Africa had attempted 90 tackles to Japan\u2019s 16 yet they led 5-3, the score at the break. The Springboks should have had two more tries but Lukhanyo Am\u2019s pass out of the back of his hand to Makazole Mapimpi after Damian de Allende\u2019s break hit the wing\u2019s leg while de Allende made it over the line on 40 minutes only for the referee Wayne Barnes to rule that he had been held not in a tackle but by the prop Jiwon Koo who fell on him.\n\nSouth Africa took the lead after three minutes, the fourth time in five matches that Japan had conceded the opening try. The Springboks had a scrum 25 metres out on the left and de Klerk, whose sweeping in defence thwarted a number of home attacks, spotted that Japan were hiding their fly-half Yu Tamura on the right wing and fired the ball to Mapimpi.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Makazole Mapimpi dives for the line to score the opening try for South Africa.

South Africa had little time to build on the lead before their prop Tendai Mtawarira was sent to the sin-bin for a tip tackle on his opposite number Keita Inagaki.\n\nWales come from behind to beat 14-man France in World Cup quarter-final Read more\n\nHe may face a citing having driven the prop into the ground. Had Inagaki not cushioned his fall with his left elbow, he would have landed head first. It gave Japan a numerical advantage for 10 minutes that they looked to exploit by moving the ball at the point of contact, bringing in runners from deep and switching the direction of attack.\n\nThere was nothing that South Africa did not expect, but what was different was Japan\u2019s kicking game. It exposed Willie le Roux who, after being upended by Michael Leitch, was beset by uncertainty under the high ball. In contrast, Japan\u2019s back three dealt with everything put in the air by Handre Pollard, correcting the hosts\u2019 greatest weakness in the pool stage.\n\nFor all their slick passing and movement off the ball, Japan struggled to put their wings into space. Kenki Fukuoka got away once, but no matter how much South Africa were stretched defensively, they never snapped. The home side\u2019s trickery was rehearsed when the Springboks needed to be infected with doubt.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Japanese players contemplate defeat at the final whistle.

The crowd roared but, slowly at first, the energy started to drain out of the home side and the Springboks took the direct route after the break and wore down Japan up front. Three Pollard penalties extended their lead to 11 points before de Klerk barked orders to his forwards as a scrum rumbled forwards 15 metres into the home 22, on hand to receive the scoring pass to settle the contest.\n\nSouth Africa added a third try after Japan lost an attacking line-out to Pieter-Steph du Toit and a swift counterattack finished with Mapimpi scoring at the other end.
