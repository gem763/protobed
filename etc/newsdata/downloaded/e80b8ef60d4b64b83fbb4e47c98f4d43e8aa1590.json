Which one is best?\n\nWhen you are an overseas voter, you have two options to vote \u2014 by proxy or postal. If you happen to be in the UK the day of the election you can also go and vote in person.\n\nYou'll be asked to make your choice when you register to vote.\n\nA proxy vote is cast in the last constituency you lived in, so the person you choose to be your proxy must drop off your ballot at the correct polling station.\n\nThe coalition group of British citizens living in the EU, British in Europe, recommends Brits to favour vote by proxy rather than by post.\n\n\"Following the issues of getting postal ballots to Brits in the continent in time to return, the best thing to do is cut out the international post element, especially once Christmas post is factored in,\" Kathryn Dobson from British in Europe said.\n\n\"We have made a series of recommendations that the UK Government should consider to improve the ways that overseas electors vote in UK elections,\" the UK's electoral commission told Euronews.\n\n\"These include exploring the possibility of overseas electors printing off their own ballot papers and returning them to their returning officer and voting in embassies or consulates. Any changes to the law are a matter for the UK Government and Parliament to consider.\"\n\nHow do postal votes work?\n\nTo apply for a postal vote then you can print and fill out this form and send it to your electoral registration office.\n\nPostal votes must be returned to the local authority or polling station by 10 pm on polling day, the electoral commission said.\n\nIf a proxy voter cannot make it to the polling station, they can also send in the ballot by post.\n\nTo apply for a proxy vote you need to download and send in this form to your former local electoral office by either email or post.", "description": "The most important is making sure you are still registered to vote.", "authors": ["Cristina Abellan Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/76/58/1000x563_cmsv2_743baa6e-93e5-543f-9977-cab77071cdd2-4267658.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
