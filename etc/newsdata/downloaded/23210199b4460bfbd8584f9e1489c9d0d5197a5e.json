It also hides when the account holder is active on Instagram or when they\u2019ve read a direct message.\n\nThe company also separately announced today that it\u2019s rolling out a new feature that\u2019ll leverage AI to flag potentially offensive comments and ask the commenter if they really want to follow through with posting. They\u2019ll be given the opportunity to undo their comment, and Instagram says that during tests, it encouraged \u201csome\u201d people to reflect and undo what they wrote. Clearly, that \u201csome\u201d stat isn\u2019t concrete, and presumably, people posting offensive content know that they\u2019re doing so, but maybe they\u2019ll take a second to reconsider what they\u2019re saying.\n\nInstagram has already tested multiple bully-focused features, including an offensive comment filter that automatically screens bullying comments that \u201ccontain attacks on a person\u2019s appearance or character, as well as threats to a person\u2019s well-being or health\u201d as well as a similar feature for photos and captions. The features are much needed, but they might not actually do much to prevent teens from harassing each other. In a report in The Atlantic last year, reporter Taylor Lorenz wrote that teens often create entire hate accounts dedicated to bullying specific people more than they bully on a main feed. Users can report these accounts, but that could require time to see any action taken. These new features, at least, are immediate and more helpful, if that\u2019s where the bullying is happening.", "description": "Instagram is launching a test soon that\u2019ll give users the power to essentially \"shadow ban\" a user from their account, meaning the account holder can \"restrict\" another user, which makes their comments visible only to themselves.
