Here's what to look for to gauge Cable\u2019s path going forward.\n\nGBP Weekly Chart\n\nFirst, however, it\u2019s necessary to understand where sterling is coming from, in order to attempt to figure out where it\u2019s going next. While it\u2019s true that the pound lost as much as a third of its value leading up to \u2014 and in the aftermath of \u2014 the Brexit vote in mid-2016, Cable was already in a clear downtrend from the time of the 2008 crash, from which the UK never recovered.\n\nPolitical uncertainty has been the prime mover of the country\u2019s currency, overshadowing better-than expected economic activity. Still, the pound has been falling since its April 2018 high.\n\nUK GDP Growth Rate Chart\n\nIn the above chart, of the UK's since 2014, it's clear that growth has been mostly steady. Only recently has expansion shriveled and plunged even as political factors\u2014Brexit-deal optimism\u2014propelled sterling higher, contrary to the country's worst growth since 2013.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the pound jumped yesterday to close above both the 200 DMA and 50 WMA, as well as slightly above the downtrend line since the Apr. 18 high, for the first time. At this point, the currency is hovering at those levels, as traders wait for further clues about the path to the much sought-after deal between the UK and the EU.\n\nNote, the pound paused above the medium-term downtrend line, which also happens to be the top of the short-term rising channel. And to emphasize just how sensitive this price level is, the 200 DMA/50 WMA showed up, making this a trend intersection.\n\nWill the short-term uptrend reverse the medium-term downtrend, giving pound bulls an opening to take up the long-term downtrend since the crash of a generation, currently at 1.4000? Will a Brexit deal slip through Johnson\u2019s fingers, pushing the pound back toward record lows below 1.2000?\n\nAnother leg up, which held after a pullback above the short-term rising channel top and broken 2008 downtrend line confluence, would dramatically increase the odds for a medium-term reversal. Alternatively, a long red candle would suggest a return to the bottom of the short-term rising channel, and if that broke, would retest the 1.2000 level.\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nConservative traders should wait for a trend resolution as described in the previous paragraph.\n\nModerate traders could go long on an upside breakout of the short-term rising channel, followed by a pullback for a better entry and not necessarily for proof of support. Or they'd short if the long red candle materializes, following a return-move for reduced exposure but not necessarily for retesting the trend's integrity.\n\nAggressive traders may move on an upside breakout or the long red candle.\n\nTrade Sample \u2013 Long Position Setup\n\nNote: A trade sample is just a sample, not a trading lesson; it provides a crude sample demonstrating the basic principles to take into account, not trading advice\n\nEntry: 1.2900\n\nStop-Loss:1.2800\n\nRisk: 100 pips\n\nTarget: 1.3200\n\nReward: 300 pips\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3", "description": "Forex Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: GBP/USD.
