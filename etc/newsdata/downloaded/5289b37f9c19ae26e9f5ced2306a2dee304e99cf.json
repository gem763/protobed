In contrast, the bright center of NGC 7714 appears to be undergoing a burst of new star formation.\u2019\n\nThe galactic horror crash started about 150 million years ago and should continue for several hundred million years.\n\nThis will probably lead to the creation of one single galaxy.\n\nAn illustration showing what an Earthling might see when Andromeda collides with the Milky Way\n\nIt\u2019s long been known that Andromeda will smash into humanity\u2019s home galaxy in the future.\n\nAstronomers recently uncovered new details of this galactic mega beasts murderous past.\n\nA team from the Australian National University has discovered large \u2018streams of stars\u2019 which indicate Andromeda munched several smaller galaxies within the past few billion years.\n\nIt may even have \u2018gobbled up\u2019 galaxies 10 billion years ago when it was first forming.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018The Milky Way is on a collision course with Andromeda in about four billion years.,\u2019 said Dr Dougal Mackey, from the ANU Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So knowing what kind of a monster our galaxy is up against is useful in finding out the Milky Way\u2019s ultimate fate.\n\n\u2018Andromeda has a much bigger and more complex stellar halo than the Milky Way, which indicates that it has cannibalised many more galaxies, possibly larger ones.\u2019\n\nThe scientists analysed clumps of stars called globular clusters to reveal \u2018signs of ancient feasting\u2019.\n\n\u2018By tracing the faint remains of these smaller galaxies with embedded star clusters, we\u2019ve been able to recreate the way Andromeda drew them in and ultimately enveloped them at the different times,\u2019 Dr Mackey added.\n\nThe scientist believes Andromeda also fed in two different directions, pulling in material from two sides.\n\n\u2018This is very weird and suggests that the extragalactic meals are fed from what\u2019s known as the \u2018cosmic web\u2019 of matter that threads the universe,\u2019 said Professor Geraint Lewis from the Sydney Institute for Astronomy and University of Sydney School of Physics.\n\n\u2018More surprising is the discovery that the direction of the ancient feeding is the same as the bizarre \u201cplane of satellites\u201d, an unexpected alignment of dwarf galaxies orbiting Andromeda.\n\n\u2018This deepens the mystery as the plane must be young, but it appears to be aligned with ancient feeding of dwarf galaxies. Maybe this is because of the cosmic web, but really, this is only speculation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019re going to have to think quite hard to unravel what this is telling us.\u2019\n\n\u2018We are cosmic archaeologists, except we are digging through the fossils of long-dead galaxies rather than human history.\u2019\n\nScientists recently worked out how long we\u2019ve got until the Milky Way smashes into Andromeda \u2013 and you don\u2019t need to be too worried just yet.\n\nIt\u2019s now believed this will happen in 4.5 billion years time, rather than 3.9 billion years into the future.\n\nAstronomers used data from the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia satellite to study the movements of Andromeda.\n\nThey said the collision will happen later than expected and will also be \u2018less destructive\u2019, with the two galaxies hitting each other in a \u2018glancing blow\u2019 rather than a head-on collision.\n\n\u2018This finding is crucial to our understanding of how galaxies evolve and interact,\u2019 said Timo Prusti, ESA Gaia Project Scientist.", "description": "Humanity's starry home is doomed to smash into a neighbouring 'cannibal' galaxy called Andromeda.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-10-at-10.58.44-695c_1570703150.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
