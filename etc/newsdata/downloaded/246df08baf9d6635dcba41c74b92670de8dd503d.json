Bakkt allow for a few things, but none require piling in on launch. \u2022More robust $BTC borrowing/lending markets to form \u2022Legitimize the asset \u2022Ease manipulation concerns (oracle risk, basis risk) \u2022Potentially disrupt some of OTC market functions,\u201d he noted.\n\nBakkt =/= a Binance IEO.

But, Bakkt actually launching before the year\u2019s end sets a good precedent entering 2020. As brokers get ready, it will likely see more volume,\u201d he explained.\n\nBakkt isn't showing a whole lot of bitcoin volume on its first day of trading, no fireworks as many expected.
