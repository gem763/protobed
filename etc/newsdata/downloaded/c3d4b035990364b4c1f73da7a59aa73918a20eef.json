is held in September, provides designers with the opportunity to display their spring/summer designs for the following year.\n\nBy sharing their designs far in advance of the season, fashion designers can dictate which sartorial trends are likely to prove a hit among consumers in the forthcoming months.\n\nWhen is it?\n\nThe spring/summer London Fashion Week is taking place this year from Friday 13 September until Tuesday 17 September.\n\nIt immediately follows New York Fashion Week, which is being held in the Big Apple from Friday 6 September until Saturday 14 September.\n\nMilan follows London from Tuesday 17 September until Monday 23 September, with Paris scheduled to take place last from Monday 23 September until Tuesday 1 October.\n\nFor the full London Fashion Week schedule, click here.\n\nWhere does it take place?\n\nLondon Fashion Week is due to be held at BFC's show space at The Store X, a showroom located at 180 The Strand in the capital.\n\nAre tickets available to buy?\n\nFashion weeks are traditionally invite-only events, exclusive only to selected members of the press and fashion industry, stylists, influencers and celebrities.\n\nHowever, this year London Fashion Week has become the first of the \"Big Four\" to invite members of the public to purchase tickets for the highly-anticipated fashion fixture.\n\nFashion aficionados can buy standard tickets for \u00a3135, granting them access to catwalk shows, access to BFC's Positive Fashion Exhibition, a complimentary drink, a complimentary LFW tote bag and access to a Positive Fashion Talk.\n\nThose who wish to emulate their favourite A-list celebrities can buy front row tickets for \u00a3245.\n\nIn addition to access to the front row of catwalk shows, the two exhibitions and a complimentary drink, this ticket also provides guests with access to a VIP lounge and a tote bag filled with freebies.\n\nIn August, the BFC announced that fashion brands House of Holland and Self-Portrait would stage public-facing shows at London Fashion Week on Sunday 15 September to ticket holders during three different time slots: 10am, 1pm and 4pm.\n\nFor more information on London Fashion Week tickets, click here.\n\nWho is invited to attend?\n\nIn addition to members of the public, who can this year purchase tickets for London Fashion Week for the first time, the audience at the five-day event will consist of a plethora of buyers, fashion journalists and trend forecasters.\n\nA myriad of celebrities will also receive invitations to attend certain shows, many of whom will have previous connections to featured designers.\n\nIn February, stars including the cast of hit Netflix series Sex Education, former Love Island contestant Eyal Booker and radio presenter Clara Amfo were spotted at autumn/winter shows at London Fashion Week.\n\nWho are the designers to look out for?\n\nLondon Fashion Week will mark the return of British fashion designer Molly Goddard to London Fashion Week, seven months after wowing the crowds in the capital with her ethereal, pastel-coloured autumn/winter collection.\n\nGoddard was brought into the spotlight in 2018 when one of her designs was worn by Killing Eve antagonist Villanelle, played by English actor Jodie Comer.\n\nOnly time will tell if Goddard's latest offering will make as bold a statement on the catwalk as her previous striking designs.\n\nAlso making an appearance for a third consecutive season is Victoria Beckham, who launched her eponymous fashion brand in September 2008.\n\nBeckham made her debut London Fashion Week appearance this time last year, her husband David Beckham and their four children all sitting in the front row in support of the matriarch.\n\nRixo, the unassuming brand of the moment, will be holding its presentation on the second day of the fashion event.\n\nThe London-based label has proven increasingly popular among fashion fans thanks to its bright, eye-catching prints and flowing fits, ideal for the soon-to-be-over summer wedding season.\n\nKeep up to date with The Independent's London Fashion Week coverage here.", "description": "Now that the summer is drawing to a close, followers of
