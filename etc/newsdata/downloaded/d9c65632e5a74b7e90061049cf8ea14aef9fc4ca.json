It\u2019s a question we should ponder in all seriousness.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith regard to Syria, the Russians are being pulled deeper into that region and soon will draw bright \u201cred lines\u201d that must never be crossed. In Hong Kong, the authoritarian government of the People\u2019s Republic of China soon may make those lines blood red.\n\nThis is not a game. It\u2019s not an academic exercise, or a Hollywood movie. There will be no referees to throw a flag, no professors to give a do-over, and no rewrites with happy endings. Russia and China are two dictatorial, ruthless regimes rapidly reaching the point where they no longer will negotiate or cave to U.S. demands.\n\nIn the worlds they rule, to cave in to populist pressure regarding \u201crights and liberty for all\u201d is tantamount to a self-inflicted death sentence.\n\nIf pushed into a corner, they will spring out in a vicious attack to protect that which they cannot lose \u2014 even if such an attack steps directly upon the tripwire. That should petrify us all.\n\n\u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d is the slogan of the moment for those looking to put a dictatorial government in its place. But it also has become a cottage industry, with potential to make millions of dollars for entrepreneurs who are happy to profit off millennials protesting from the safety of cities other than Hong Kong.\n\nIn a perfect world, we all want to stand with Hong Kong in its aim to remain free of China\u2019s aggressive overreach. But our world not only is far from perfect, it\u2019s getting more dangerous by the day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProtesters, celebrities, self-absorbed media personalities and U.S. politicians are conveniently \u201coutraged\u201d that the National Basketball Association, Hollywood, certain corporations and a long list of others might put profit before the oppressed people of Hong Kong.\n\nIn a perfect world, that would never happen. In the real world we inhabit, it has been going on since the first days of commerce and profit. Nazi Germany benefitted from such deals with the devil, as have rogue nations and tyrants before and since.\n\nIs it right? No. Will it ever stop? Not as long as human frailties and greed exist.\n\nI suspect that most people who order Stand with Hong Kong t-shirts have no idea of what they are protesting.\n\nIn a nutshell, the protests in Hong Kong started in June against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China. The city leaders of Hong Kong soon agreed to suspend the extradition bill, but the protesters then demanded \u201cfull democracy\u201d for Hong Kong. Full democracy, for a city in a communist nation.\n\nFor those who might not remember, in 1997 Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the communist government of China. The communist leaders recognized that Hong Kong had been Westernized to a large extent and, even though it was now under their rule, they allowed it to retain more rights and autonomy than in the mainland, a hybrid government known as \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d\n\nWith all of the flaws \u2014 and outright atrocities \u2014 associated with the leadership of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Hong Kong was a functioning first-world city in many ways.\n\nWe all want full democracy for every human being, everywhere on earth. But what price are we willing to pay to try to force that to happen in totalitarian nations and rogue states?\n\nHong Kong is, in fact, a city of communist China. Will the protesters around the world next demand full democracy for Beijing? Will they travel to North Korea and demand it for Pyongyang? What about Damascus \u2014 will they travel there to march in the streets against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian protectors?\n\nConflicts and wars in the Middle East have been bottomless pits of quicksand that have sucked the life out of invading or protecting nations for centuries. The situation in Syria regarding the Kurds is now a pressure-cooker put on fast-boil by Turkey\u2019s incursion and Russia\u2019s actions. What price are we willing to pay if that top blows off, or if we nudge that top off?\n\nWords are cheap but lives are precious. There is evil in the world, and people who foster and control such evil. Sometimes, as with Hitler and the Nazis, such evil must be confronted at any cost in a quest to stop it.\n\nThis is not about appeasing such evil. It is about knowing the differences and enacting policies commensurate with the crime or the threat. Hong Kong and Syria could be tripwires for the truly unimaginable. Our leaders must recognize that reality and act accordingly.\n\nDouglas MacKinnon, a political and communications consultant, was a writer in the White House for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W.
