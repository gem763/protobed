The officials weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe agreement could lead to migrants from third countries obtaining refuge in El Salvador \u2013 even though many Salvadorans are fleeing their nation and seeking asylum in the US. A Salvadoran delegation has been in the US this week discussing the matter.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest effort by Donald Trump to force asylum seekers in Central America to seek refuge outside the US. Immigration officials also are forcing more than 42,000 people to remain in Mexico as their legal cases play out and have changed policy to deny asylum to anyone who transited through a third country en route to the southern border of the US.\n\nTrump officials to move to impose near-total block on asylum seekers at border Read more\n\nThe agreement would be another step by the Trump administration aimed at stopping the flow of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.\n\nMcAleenan also signed a so-called \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement with Guatemala, but officials in that country are still working out how it would be implemented.\n\nThe arrangement with El Salvador was not described as a \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement, under which nations agree that their respective countries are safe enough and have robust enough asylum systems, so that if migrants transit through one of the countries they must remain there instead of moving on to another country.\n\nThe US officially has only one such agreement in place, with Canada, but has been working toward others in Honduras and agreed to the one in Guatemala that has not yet been implemented.\n\nThe Trump administration this year threatened to withhold all federal assistance to three Central American countries unless they did more to end the migrant crisis.\n\nThe move was met by stiff resistance in Congress as experts had said that the cuts would likely only exacerbate the number of migrants seeking to make the hazardous journey to the US because of a further lack of resources.\n\nIn June, the state department announced that the Trump administration was reversing some of the cuts but would not approve future aid to those nations. The state department said then that about $370m from the 2018 budget will not be spent and instead will be moved to other projects.\n\nThe gang-plagued El Salvador is among the world\u2019s deadliest countries, with one of the highest homicide rates on the globe.\n\nAccording to a 2018 state department report, human rights issues included allegations of \u201cunlawful killings of suspected gang members and others by security forces; forced disappearances by military personnel; torture by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of government respect for judicial independence\u201d.\n\nMany people who flee from El Salvador have said they and their families were threatened by gang members. Teenagers often are pressured to join gangs and have had their lives and their families threatened if they refuse. Some young women are forced to become the girlfriends of gang members, facing rape or murder if they refuse.\n\n", "description": "Deal could lead to migrants obtaining refuge in El Salvador, one of Central America\u2019s most violent countries", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21f51a833a562c8a3b6f0e407dc57121f6ca2dd8/0_0_6232_3740/master/6232.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=345c9b693ac91ec31574f1d6f2fcec31", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
