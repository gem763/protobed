It isn\u2019t Apple Inc., Visa Inc. or even PayPal Holdings Inc. It\u2019s Google.\n\nThe Alphabet Inc. unit has for years tried to diversify its revenues beyond advertising by pushing into new fields like cloud computing and hardware. While its profits remain healthy, it needs new ways to make money as the specter of regulation looms at home and around the globe. Its booming new business in the world\u2019s largest untapped digital market could be the engine of expansion that it has been looking for.\n\nIn India today, the company has one of its fastest-growing hits ever with Google Pay, a two-year-old app that millions of consumers are using to spend and transfer tens of billions of dollars.\n\nResembling a chat app and available in local languages, Google Pay was the most downloaded financial technology app world-wide last year, according to SensorTower, a research and marketing firm for the app industry.\n\nIndian consumers use it to buy train tickets, pay bills and can even purchase lunchtime meals from street vendors. Tiny mom-and-pop shops around the country now display a logo with a large \u201cG\u201d and Google\u2019s blue, red, yellow and green colors, signaling that merchants accept payments via the app.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s good reason for Google being bullish,\u201d said Satish Meena, a New Delhi-based analyst with research firm Forrester. \u201cThey\u2019re getting good traction. The opportunity in India is massive.\u201d\n\nThe app has been downloaded more than 180 million times since it launched in September 2017 and in the first half of this year, it clocked more downloads world-wide than PayPal or its Venmo app. It also outpaced Alipay, from Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, data from SensorTower showed.\n\n\u201cIndia is setting the global standard on how to digitize payments,\u201d Caesar Sengupta, Google\u2019s vice president for its Next Billion Users initiative and payments, said Thursday at an event in New Delhi. In the past year, the service has processed transactions worth more than $110 billion on an annualized basis via the government\u2019s popular real-time payments platform, he said.\n\nAnalysts estimate Google Pay is now used as much as or more than any other service, including apps backed by Tencent and Paytm, which counts among its investors Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., SoftBank Group Corp. and Alibaba.\n\nGoogle offers other payment systems branded Google Pay around the world, but Google Pay in India is the only service of its kind offering real-time payments without the use of credit or debit cards between individuals and businesses.\n\nShop owners can display a printed QR code for shoppers to scan, or two individuals can open the app, hold their phones together and use audio pairing to connect and make payments.\n\nHundreds of millions of Indians are entering the digital economy for the first time thanks to inexpensive mobile data and smartphones. Cash still rules, but most Indians have bank accounts and for simple payments they are skipping plastic and going straight to mobile.\n\nThe catalyst for mobile-payment growth came in 2016, when India\u2019s government nullified the largest-denomination cash notes in circulation to curb corruption. That triggered a crunch and consumers had to stand in long lines for ATMs. Many downloaded mobile wallets like Paytm\u2019s, learned more about digital payments and became comfortable making them.\n\nGoogle, sensing an opportunity to get a digital payments foothold in the country of 1.3 billion, has used its massive war chest to capture users with an advertising blitz and cash awards.\n\nThe value of mobile payments in India is well behind China\u2019s, but is ahead of the U.S. The value of mobile payments could nearly double to hit $450 billion a year by 2023, according to a 2018 report from Morgan Stanley , with Google wringing as much as $4.5 billion annually out of the business should it introduce advertising or other new services.\n\nGoogle has an early lead but isn\u2019t without challenges. The biggest one on the horizon is Facebook \u2019s WhatsApp. The platform has 400 million users in India, more than any other country, and it rolled out a trial payments service to a million users in February 2018.\n\nA street vendor in New Delhi, who sells fruit and other snacks, accepts Google Pay and other mobile payment options.

WhatsApp says it adheres to those rules and hopes to be able to fully launch the service to all users in India in the coming months.\n\nAnalysts say that Google, having fully launched Google Pay before the guidelines were issued, hasn\u2019t been affected. A Google spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Google Pay\u2019s adherence to data localization guidelines.\n\n\u201cOne year ago no one knew about this app,\u201d said Surender Singh, a sales clerk in a New Delhi smartphone shop.\n\nWhile customers still use rival apps, Google Pay\u2019s usage is surging more than others, with nine or 10 people a day using it at his shop to buy items like chargers and headsets, spending as much as $40 per transfer, he said.\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t have credit cards or cash, they use Google Pay,\u201d said Mr. Singh.\n\nWrite to Newley Purnell at newley.purnell@wsj.com", "description": "The leading player in the battle for mobile payments in India isn\u2019t a Chinese firm, Apple, Visa or PayPal.
