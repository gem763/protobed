Yet EU sources insist Johnson\u2019s envoy, David Frost, has barely started to touch on concrete proposals.\n\nWriting for his former employer, the Daily Telegraph, on Monday, Johnson expressed optimism for a deal, but offered no details, saying: \u201cI believe passionately that we can do it, and I believe that such an agreement is in the interests not just of the UK but of our European friends. We are working flat out to get one.\u201d\n\nDescribing Johnson\u2019s meeting on Monday with the European commission president as \u201can important milestone\u201d in the talks, Raab told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that complaints about a lack of detail were \u201cjust part and parcel of the tactical posturing that goes on in any negotiation\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe EU know our position. Lots of the detail has been talked through at both technical and political level, and actually the framework, as I have just described it, is very clear.\n\n\u201cOf course, the nature of these negotiations is that there will be a tendency to try and rubbish things we put forward in order to exact further demands. We\u2019re not going to get involved in that.\u201d\n\nRaab argued that the EU\u2019s complaints about a lack of detail masked an unwillingness in Brussels to move on its own positions. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear on all of this in the talks, and we\u2019ll continue to flesh out and be able to respond to any questions.\n\n\u201cBut of course at some point the EU is going to have to put up it hands and say: \u2018OK, we know that there\u2019s the requirement for some pragmatism and flexibility to get this deal over the line.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnson has until the European council summit in mid-October to reach a deal or he will be compelled under a newly passed backbench-instigated law to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline beyond 31 October, something he has vowed he will not do.\n\nDowning Street\u2019s hopes of a deal centre on finding a technical fix under which Northern Ireland would remain converged with the Republic of Ireland in some sectors, notably food and agriculture, while arrangements for other goods would involve avoiding checkpoints at the border.\n\nThis operation would only come into force at the end of a transition period triggered by a deal, currently slated to finish in December 2020. On Sunday the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, argued this deadline could be extended for a year or two to give more flexibility.\n\nBut this idea was dismissed by Raab: \u201cNo. It\u2019s not something under consideration.\u201d\n\nHe argued repeatedly that it was up to the EU to shift.\n\n\u201cWe want to see some finality to this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has got to that moment in time, as we lead into the October council, for the decisions to be made. We\u2019re willing and able to do a deal on the grounds I\u2019ve described. The question now is whether the EU has got the political will to meet us to get that deal, which is good for both sides.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, an EU source expressed exasperation at what they said was a continued lack of detailed negotiation, saying Johnson seemed more focused on political stunts, such as using a newspaper interview to compare himself to the Incredible Hulk.\n\nThey said: \u201cIt all makes it look like it\u2019s a bit of a joke. We are talking about something extremely serious. The consequences of no deal will be extremely serious and it looks like this is being treated as a game in which you are the hero sort of story rather than [dealing] with real lives.\u201d", "description": "Foreign secretary says complaints about lack of detail mask unwillingness to move", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "John Harris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12bce85a7e956fda1f6512704e7f28179fe3de81/701_97_3130_1877/master/3130.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bcd8d43db1985081473983df992dfa04", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
