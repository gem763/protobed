REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, usually a vocal ally to President Donald Trump, has repeatedly criticized Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria.\n\nGraham told media outlet Axios in an interview published on Wednesday that the sanctions would strike the Turkish economy and military. He predicted the Senate could marshal the votes to override any potential presidential veto.\n\n\u201cWho the hell supports Erdogan over the Kurds?\u201d Graham told Axios, referring to Turkey\u2019s president. He predicted \u201ca devastating ripple effect\u201d from Turkish action in Syria.\n\nGraham warned that Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the troops opened the way for a Turkish strike on Kurdish-led forces long allied with Washington.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s doing this completely against everybody else\u2019s advice. He will get 100% of the credit if he knows something the rest of us don\u2019t. And he\u2019s going to get 100% of the blame. There\u2019ll be no middle ground,\u201d Graham said.\n\nIn a tweet on Tuesday, Graham warned Ankara of \u201csanctions from hell\u201d if it moved into northern Syria. \u201cWide, deep, and devastating sanctions,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen said in a post on Twitter that a bipartisan sanctions bill was being finalised on Wednesday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Turkish military and Syrian rebel allies launched an operation in Syria on Wednesday with air strikes. It will be supported by artillery and howitzer fire.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the operation aimed to eliminate a \u201cterror corridor\u201d along the Turkish border.\n\nAnkara has branded the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists because of their ties to militants who have waged an insurgency in Turkey.\n\nErdogan said the offensive would aim to eliminate threats from the YPG and Islamic State militants, and pave the way for Syrian refugees in Turkey to return after the formation of a \u201csafe zone\u201d in the area.\n\n\u201cErdogan is not our friend and Congress will push back. We\u2019re not giving Turkey a green light in Congress and we\u2019re not going to abandon the Kurds. If the president does so, we won\u2019t,\u201d Graham said in an interview on Wednesday with Fox News Channel.", "description": "A leading U.S. Republican senator said he plans to introduce a package of \"devastating\" sanctions to hit Turkey over its military operation in northeast Syria, expressing concerns over the fate of Kurds in the area.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438945641&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981F9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
