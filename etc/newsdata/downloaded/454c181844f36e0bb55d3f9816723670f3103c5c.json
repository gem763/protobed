That's after incomes have been adjusted for household size, since smaller households require less money to support the same lifestyle as larger ones.\n\nAbout half of American households, 52%, were considered middle-class, while 29% were lower-class. The median income of middle-class households was $78,442 in 2016. For lower-income households, it was $25,624.\n\nThese numbers are in 2016 dollars and scaled to reflect a three-person household.\n\nPew looked at various household sizes. Here's the minimum amount you'd have to earn each year to be considered upper-class, depending on the size of your family:\n\nHousehold of one: Minimum of $78,281 to be upper-class\n\nHousehold of two: Minimum of $110,706 to be upper-class\n\nHousehold of three: Minimum of $135,586 to be upper-class\n\nHousehold of four: Minimum of $156,561 to be upper-class\n\nHousehold of five: Minimum of $175,041 to be upper-class", "description": "About one-fifth of American adults live in \"upper-income households,\" according to a 2018 report from Pew Research Center.
