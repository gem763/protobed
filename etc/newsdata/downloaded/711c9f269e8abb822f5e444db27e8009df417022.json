A dollar amount for the value of the land in question was not disclosed.\n\nTalking Point Sidewalk had asked Waterfront to allocate 190 acres of land for development. The agreement will see Sidewalk develop only the 12-acre plot Waterfront had originally proposed. The tentative deal will also see data from the smart city treated as a public asset, instead of being collected by an independent organization, as Sidewalk had proposed. Once approved, the parties will have until spring 2020 to agree on a full development plan, or sign a new agreement further extending their timeline.\n\nThe two sides have been in negotiations since the release of Sidewalk Labs\u2019 Master Innovation and Development Plan (MIDP) in June, and have until Thursday to finalize an agreement that would allow the project to move forward.\n\nThough Waterfront\u2019s board will need to approve the agreement on Thursday morning, that is expected to be a formality.\n\nSidewalk\u2019s MIDP had requested that Waterfront, the organization tasked by three levels of government with oversight of the redevelopment of Toronto\u2019s lakeshore, allocate 190 acres for an area it called the IDEA District. The company proposed it lead the development of 16 per cent of that land, including the Quayside plot and a western portion of Villiers Island. The agreement will see Sidewalk develop only the 12-acre plot Waterfront had originally proposed at what multiple sources called \u201cfair market value.\u201d\n\nThe Sidewalk MIDP had proposed the creation of an independent Urban Data Trust that would oversee the collection of all data produced by the smart city. However, the two parties have also agreed in principle that any data obtained in the proposed smart city would be treated as a public asset. As a result, Sidewalk Labs, an urban innovation firm owned by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, will be considered a vendor with no proprietary access, sources said.\n\nAfter Sidewalk released its MIDP in June, Waterfront Toronto board chair Stephen Diamond wrote an open letter addressing several of the organization\u2019s early \u201cconcerns.\u201d They included Sidewalk\u2019s proposals to expand the plan beyond the 12-acre Quayside neighbourhood and to extend public transit into the area.\n\nDiamond\u2019s letter also said Waterfront would need additional information to determine if Sidewalk\u2019s data collection and governance proposals complied with the law and with his agency\u2019s own digital governance principles.\n\nIn August, the two parties announced they would extend their agreement until March 2020 to allow more time to negotiate a deal, but added a termination provision requiring them to settle their differences on the issues identified in Diamond\u2019s letter by October 31.\n\nHaving now tentatively resolved those issues, the two parties have until spring 2020 to agree on a full development plan or sign a new agreement further extending their planning timeline.\n\n\u201cWaterfront Toronto has pushed for a realignment on these critical issues in order to ensure that we have met our mandate to the public good, before determining if the MIDP can proceed to an evaluation,\u201d said Andrew Tumilty, a spokesperson for Waterfront Toronto.\n\n\u201cThese discussions continue, and to be clear, tomorrow, our Board of Directors is scheduled to meet to decide on whether or not these issues have been resolved, and the MIDP can proceed to a formal evaluation,\u201d said Tumilty.\n\nSidewalk Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nShare the full article!

As the controversy grew, Waterfront suffered several high-profile departures, and Sidewalk\u2019s privacy adviser resigned.\n\nHowever, it has continued to enjoy the support of a range of high-profile backers, including former Toronto mayors Barbara Hall and Art Eggleton and urban theorist Richard Florida.\n\nWith files from David Skok", "description": "The deal limits the development to Toronto\u2019s Quayside, and makes data a public asset", "authors": ["Amanda Roth", "Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Quayside01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
