That\u2019s what and how they tattooed holocaust survivors. Should have thought this one through.\"\n\n\"Yikes really strong Holocaust vibes,\" contributed one of her followers.\n\nAnother mused: \"Remember when having numbers tattooed on your forearm was not so cool? Times changed. Good.\"\n\nSome who were not keen of the likeness added: \"Seems scary- like numbers tattooed during the Holocaust. I don\u2019t like this\" and \"Is anyone else a little bothered by the fact that she got a series of numbers on her forearm? Is the Holocaust really that far removed from our reality? Anyone??\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nA social media user urged: \"Chrissy, I know you didn\u2019t mean to evoke this with your tattoo, but I encourage you to look up the history of holocaust tattoos - a series of numbers forcibly given to people held in concentration camps to identify them. This has potential to be very offensive, even if that was not your intention.\"\n\n\"@chrissyteigen I respect your symbolism and it's your body to do what you want with but this makes me think of the Holocaust and the numbers they'd write\" contributed a follower.\n\n(Image: Barcroft)\n\nA Instagram user asked: \"Is it just me or does this look like concentration camp numbers that they would tattoo on ppl?\"\n\nHer husband John Legend penned below the gallery: \"The ultimate mnemonic device!\"\n\nChrissy, who is never one to shy away from responding to social media comments, is yet to respond to the comments.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
