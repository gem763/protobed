Some of the tweets were up for about 30 minutes before Twitter took them down.\n\nThe tweets included messages such as \u201cHitler is innocent\u201d and, using a vulgarity, asked \u201cbald skeleton head tramp,\u201d apparently referring to Dorsey, to unsuspend certain accounts.\n\nTwitter says it\u2019s investigating. The company suspended accounts that the hacker or hackers retweeted while they had control of Dorsey\u2019s account. Twitter also suspended the account that appeared to be responsible for the hack. Based on some of the tweets sent from Dorsey\u2019s account, a group called Chuckle Squad was likely responsible.\n\nThe incident comes as Twitter and Dorsey have promised to improve the \u201chealth\u201d and civility of discourse on the social media service, cracking down on hate speech and abuse. Long criticized for allowing bad behavior to run rampant, Twitter has been trying to rein in the worst offenders, banning accounts that violate its terms and making others less visible.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Conservatives also complain of bias. Last year, the company permanently banned right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars show for abusive behavior.\n\nThis is not the first time Dorsey has been hacked. In 2016, his account was taken over by the hacker group OurMine, which also attacked other high-profile social media accounts.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Racist and vulgar tweets were sent Friday afternoon to his 4.2 million followers", "authors": ["Barbara Ortutay"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/twitter-jack-dorsey-hacked.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
