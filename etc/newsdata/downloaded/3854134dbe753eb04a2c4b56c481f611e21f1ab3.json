So I\u2019m happy with it and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be stimulating at this time,\u201d Marks told CNBC in an interview. \u201cTen years later, do you want to cut rates to extend an economic expansion which is the longest in history? Some question, I question whether that\u2019s a legitimate goal.\u201d\n\nThe Fed should be controlling inflation and supporting growth to create jobs, but not stopping a recession, he said. Not that he\u2019s worried too much about the latter, citing consumer strength, even as the manufacturing sector struggles with trade-war angst.\n\nOpinion: Two-thirds of these corporate insiders see a U.S. recession by end 2020\n\nIt\u2019s also not the Fed\u2019s job to bail out an ailing stock market, says Marks.\n\n\u201cOK, so you want to create jobs, OK maybe you want to prevent recessions, which I don\u2019t think you can do in perpetuity. But do you want to cut rates because the stock market is going down? I think that\u2019s totally illegitimate,\u201d says Marks.\n\nRead: Billionaire investor says Elizabeth Warren as next U.S. president would be a disaster for markets\n\nThe market\n\nDow YM00, +0.17%, S&P ES00, +0.18% and Nasdaq NQ00, +0.30% futures are inching up.
