Swann, a 67-year-old former NFL star who was an All-American wide receiver for the Trojans, could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nFolt praised Swann\u2019s \u201chistoric contributions\u201d to USC, citing the school\u2019s five national championships in various sports since he took the helm in 2016 and record-high graduation rates for athletes.\n\nBut with USC firmly at the center of the nationwide college-admissions cheating case, it has been a turbulent year for the Trojans. Folt took over as the president at USC in July, promising to \u201cget it right\u201d and figure out the best management team to support her. Prosecutors say USC officials helped facilitate admission to the private university for more than two dozen students as recruited athletes, often when those teens weren\u2019t competitive players. Four former USC employees\u2014three coaches and an athletic-department administrator\u2014have been charged in the scheme. Many of the families were admitted before Swann took over the athletics department, and a person familiar with the matter has said his predecessor, Pat Haden, is of interest to investigators. However, Swann was athletic director when a number of families gained fraudulent admission to the school as purported rowers and other athletes, prosecutors say. Though prosecutors have described USC as a victim in the case, the school actually profited from it in some ways. Singer\u2019s clients allegedly paid more than $1.3 million to USC accounts controlled by former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel between 2014 and 2018, mainly an account for the USC Women\u2019s Athletic Board. And a bank account that funded the water polo program received payments totaling $250,000, prosecutors say. Heinel has pleaded not guilty. Her attorney, Nina Marino, said last week, \u201cDonna performed her job in accordance with Pat Haden\u2019s (and later Lynn Swann\u2019s) expectations as well as those of the USC administration.\u201d Swann\u2019s resignation came just days after USC\u2019s football program returned to the Top 25 in the Associated Press poll following a 45-20 victory over Stanford. The Trojans, who failed to make the preseason Top 25 for the first time since 2001, are ranked No. 24 in this week\u2019s poll. Folt said Dave Roberts, currently a special advisor to her, would serve as interim athletics director and named a committee to conduct a national search for a permanent replacement. \u2014Jennifer Levitz contributed to this report.
