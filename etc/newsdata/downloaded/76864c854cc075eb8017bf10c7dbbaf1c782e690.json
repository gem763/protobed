They argue his centrist politics and elder-statesman status are a difficult fit with a primary electorate that is leaning progressive.\n\n\u201cFor a very long time, he's been the superficial front-runner,\u201d said Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko, who served as an aide on Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonState cites 38 people for violations in Clinton email review Trump campaign to hold rallies in Mississippi, Kentucky Biden struggles to reverse fall MORE's 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cA lot of his policies are not progressive enough. This isn't 1998 and this isn't 2008. He's spent too much time focused on thinking he has to run mainstream to be elected.\u201d\n\nBiden still has strong support among African American voters, who could still be his political salvation.\n\nWhile he is behind Warren in polls in New Hampshire and Iowa, he has a healthy lead in South Carolina.\n\nBut it\u2019s hardly clear that Biden will retain that edge, and other centrist candidates believe they now have a shot of overtaking him.

Both candidates raised more than $1 million the day after the debate.\n\nThe unaffiliated Democratic strategist said the current status of Biden\u2019s campaign should be sending alarm bells throughout the former vice president\u2019s headquarters.\n\n\u201cPeople are seeing an array of candidates. There are folks who are ready to pick up the anti-Elizabeth Warren mantle like Pete Buttigieg and if they don't reverse course soon, it's going to be all downhill from here. The question is how steep is the decline?\u201d the strategist said.\n\nParkhomenko said Democrats are worried Biden is not pushing back on Trump as his campaign advertised.\n\n\u201cHe needs to own every one of these moments and fight back. He needs to do that consistently. His response to Trump has been slow and inconsistent. That inconsistency has given people pause and concern. ... You see the numbers eroding,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman for the former vice president declined to comment.\n\nBiden has consistently cast himself as the candidate best positioned to defeat Trump in 2020, and electability has always been at the center of his message.\n\nYet, as Trump and his allies ripped Biden over his son\u2019s business in Ukraine, Biden aides realized their candidate was not punching back hard enough.\n\nThey shifted last week, showing off a more aggressive Biden, who last week called for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThey\u2019ve also sought to use the story to their advantage, arguing that the Trump attacks illustrate the president\u2019s fear of facing Biden in November.\n\nBiden aides use a drum emoji on social media to bolster their candidate\u2019s statement that he\u2019ll beat Trump \u201clike a drum.\u201d\n\nBiden, during a campaign stop in Ohio this week, responded to Trump\u2019s taunts by telling him to \u201crelease your tax returns or shut up.\u201d\n\nBut, to some, the attacks have come too late and with less intensity than they had anticipated.\n\n\u201cHe missed some real opportunities to own the whole narrative,\u201d another Democratic strategist said. \u201cTheir response seems a little off at times.\u201d\n\nSeparately, donors have complained that Biden isn\u2019t doing the kind of outreach he should be doing to cultivate relationships with longtime check-writers. Some donors and fundraisers have complained privately that they heard from Biden at the outset of the campaign and then there was no follow up from him.\n\nOther donors to the campaign say they are worried about Biden\u2019s strategy when it comes to Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how smart it is to have everything riding on South Carolina,\u201d one said.\n\n\u201cIf Warren does well in both states, she\u2019ll easily have the momentum,\u201d the donor added, referring to Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nBiden\u2019s hiccups have created openings for Buttigieg and Klobuchar \u2014 and maybe even former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg Michael Rubens BloombergDemocrats' debate divisions open the race to new (or old) faces Judge Judy: Bloomberg as president could help US heal Bloomberg: Voters must demand 2020 Democrats explain how they will implement their plans MORE, who has also discussed jumping into the race in case Biden\u2019s support declines.\n\n\u201cThe race to replace Trump will eventually come down to one progressive, Warren or Sanders and one moderate. Biden or Buttigieg,\u201d said Democratic strategist Brad Bannon. \u201cMayor Pete is within striking distance of Biden in Iowa and the former vice president\u2019s campaign could unravel quickly if he falters there.\u201d\n\nBannon said Buttigieg \u201cdistinguished himself in the last debate by offering a more compelling criticism of 'Medicare for All' than Biden did,\u201d and more errors like this could cost him the nomination.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is cruising to a bruising unless he can reverse the free fall he\u2019s been in since he announced back in the spring,\u201d he said.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign is hitting major bumps at a critical moment in the 2020 campaign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoe_101719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
