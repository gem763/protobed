The white house blaming Iran. The question now, what does this new move from the Pentagon mean for the future of this crucial and volatile region? ABC's Stephanie Ramos is here with more. Stephanie, good morning. Reporter: Whit, good morning. After placing sanctions on Iran, president trump held a meeting with his senior advisers to consider options to retaliate against Iran, deciding to give Saudi Arabia full support by supplying weapons and sending U.S. Forces. After last weekend's attack by Iran on Saudi oil fields, president trump is deploying U.S. Troops and air and missile defense systems to Saudi Arabia. Defense secretary mark Esper calling it a first step. We think for now that would be sufficient, but that doesn't mean there could be additional deployments as needed. Reporter: Esper adding Saudi Arabia and the uae requested this international support to help protect critical infrastructure. The U.S. Now planning to expedite weapons purchases to the Saudis. The United States has a responsibility to protect our citizens and our interests in the region. Reporter: The department of defense says this decision comes as Iran has become more confrontational in the region detaining tankers in the strategically important strait of hormuz as well as shooting down a U.S. Drone. In the face of the sustained maligned behavior, the united States and other countries have demonstrated great restraint in hopes that Iranian leadership would choose peace and reverse Iran's steep decline into isolation and economic collapse. Reporter: The U.S. Is now calling on its allies to support Saudi Arabia and consider providing additional defensive support and, guys, this is still a very delicate situation and just the beginning. It'll be a hot topic at the U.N. This week. No question about that. Stephanie, thank you very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The president\u2019s decision was made in response to recent attacks against a Saudi oil refinery.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190921_gma_ramos_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
