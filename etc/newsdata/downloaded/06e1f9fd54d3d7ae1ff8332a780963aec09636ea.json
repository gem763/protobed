Her new quest to create her own publishing house is short-lived, though, thanks to an astounding offer from Charles (Peter Hermann): Should she return to run the Millennial imprint, he\u2019ll award her with a large stake in the company, or enough to give her a seat on the board. \u201cYou\u2019re family, Kelsey, I knew that the day you sacrificed everything that you wanted to save us,\u201d he warmly tells her, much to her surprise. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t family, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d Who wouldn\u2019t say yes to that? Our girl is coming home!\n\nThis boomerang back to power is mirrored in Duff\u2019s professional life, with the actress recently announcing that she\u2019ll reprise her iconic (and we don\u2019t use that adjective lightly) role as Lizzie McGuire in a new Disney+ series. Lizzie, now 30 years old and living in Brooklyn, is apprenticing for a famed interior designer and engaged to a man who somehow isn\u2019t Gordo. (Gasp!) But, as Duff shared with us in a few exclusive details, Lizzie is soon \u201cforced out\u201d of New York and heads West to sort out her life. Between this and her Younger money moves, we had a lot to discuss with her. Here\u2019s what we learned \u2014 and, no, she\u2019s not as devastated as we are about Gordo.\n\nAs we talked about last year, I was so excited to see a young woman usurp an older dude for a position of power, especially one that was so deserved. So did it bum you out that Kelsey lost it under those technological circumstances?\n\nAbsolutely. The poor girl went through it this season. The show does such a good job at tackling the truth and peppering in all of these nuggets of what\u2019s going on socially, what\u2019s acceptable, and what isn\u2019t. It sucks. She got beat up pretty bad. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that she had to step down because of that. It seems women aren\u2019t allowed to make mistakes anymore. In this day and age, everything is documented and publicly known. Part of it is great, I guess, to uncover truths when that needs to happen. But human beings are human beings. It\u2019s not like Kelsey was doing anything that inappropriate. I hate that a young woman put in a position of power, who already has a little tinge of something impure about it \u2014 like, how she got the job as publisher and how they placed her there \u2014 ended up taking the fall for some pretty big stuff.\n\nKelsey has consistently been undermined by Charles, even when she was his boss, so I thought his offer of the board seat was telling of their relationship. What did that moment mean to you?\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough. I think what he did to her this season was really dirty and unfair. I\u2019m always so hard on Charles, but I love Peter Hermann. [Laughs.] The way they write Charles, I\u2019m always like, What the hell? He\u2019s always out for himself. He proposed to Liza at someone else\u2019s wedding! And he gave Kelsey that deal in a church at someone else\u2019s wedding! Be better! He\u2019s totally out for himself and doing what\u2019s good for himself. Hilary, personally, isn\u2019t happy with it!\n\nWhat would be the fair thing for Charles to do, then?\n\nPart of me is like, he should give Liza and Kelsey their own publishing house. Empirical is dead in the water, they need to move on. I know it\u2019s a family company, but it\u2019s not holding up.\n\nIf Charles means what he said about Kelsey being family, do you think she looks at him the same way? Perhaps as a father figure?\n\nI think it\u2019s a dysfunctional father figure, and I hope Kelsey figures that out next season. She has a lot of respect about how she\u2019s gotten to where she\u2019s gotten, and in the past, Charles has been pure, focused, and loving. But then this big shift happened when he fell in love with Liza. He got off track and now it\u2019s purely dysfunctional. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s ungrateful and she doesn\u2019t care about him, but I hope next season Kelsey doesn\u2019t stay.\n\nWhere do you hope she goes? It\u2019s interesting, because the question of ego comes up a lot in the finale, especially in regards to how Kelsey wants to move her career forward \u2014 she wants to work for herself on \u201csomething she owns,\u201d even if some people are cautioning her against it. Does her attitude strike you as egotistical?\n\nShe\u2019s definitely a little egotistical and it\u2019s a key thing that drives her, but she doesn\u2019t ever do it to hurt other people. She\u2019s very conscious of other people\u2019s feelings and what\u2019s fair. She\u2019s a fair fighter. She doesn\u2019t have any more interest in Quinn \u2014 she strayed just for a second and thought maybe it could become something. I do think she\u2019s going to go out on her own, though, and I\u2019d love to see her do that. She\u2019s a millennial and she\u2019s ambitious and she wants to own her own company, and that\u2019s the way it should work now. Everyone\u2019s fighting for not working for \u201cthe man\u201d and creating their own success.\n\nI\u2019m really looking forward to Kelsey\u2019s first day on the board, where I imagine she\u2019ll walk into a baker\u2019s dozen of dads in suits.\n\nThey\u2019re all going to be scratching their heads, thinking, How the hell did you get in here? You lost?\n\nI also think it\u2019s incredible that you\u2019ll be pulling double \u201c30-something in Brooklyn\u201d duty with Lizzie McGuire. Why was this the right time for you to come back to Lizzie? Hilary, I screamed!\n\nIt\u2019s been in talks for so many years with Disney, and I kept a great relationship with them. It\u2019s so great that I can talk about this now! [Laughs.] I obviously love Lizzie so much. We\u2019re connected and tethered at the soul for life. It just wasn\u2019t right until now. I wasn\u2019t excited or moved with any of the ideas I heard, or I wasn\u2019t coming up with any ideas myself to pitch. I didn\u2019t just want to come back because everybody loved her from a moment in time that stuck with them for a lifetime. I never thought, Revival shows are a thing, so I guess we\u2019ll do this one.\n\nFinally being in my 30s, it felt like a good time to revisit her. It\u2019s a complicated stage. That\u2019s what people loved about Lizzie so much \u2014 that phase of becoming a teenager. It\u2019s such a complicated but fun part of time to navigate. She was everyone\u2019s best friend. She was faced with every challenge that was relatable. Now, I think stepping into the role as a 30-year-old trying to navigate life is equally interesting. Or more specifically, waking up on your 30th birthday and thinking, This isn\u2019t how I planned this to look, what do I do now? That\u2019s an interesting story to me, and that\u2019s a good journey I want to go on with everyone again who was there for her preteen years.\n\nWill the show be set entirely in New York?\n\nShe\u2019s not going to stay in Brooklyn too long, actually. That\u2019s where she\u2019s been, but she\u2019ll be coming back to Los Angeles. She\u2019s forced out of New York. She\u2019s like, I can\u2019t be here anymore.\n\nAre you as devastated as the nation that she isn\u2019t with Gordo?\n\nYou know what, I don\u2019t know if I was as devastated by that.\n\nWhat!\n\nAh! I feel like them not being together is what was so good \u2026 it\u2019s that one person that you\u2019re like, Was he the one? Is it ever going to be? You\u2019re always kind of wondering. We wanted it to hurt everyone a little bit, and it\u2019ll continue to hurt. I really hope he\u2019s going to be involved. We\u2019ve been planning out the season and coming up with what everything looks like, and it\u2019s so important for him to be there for part of it.", "description": "Hilary Duff talked to Vulture about the Younger season six finale, as well as the return of Lizzie McGuire on Disney+.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/03/03-hilary-duff-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg"}
