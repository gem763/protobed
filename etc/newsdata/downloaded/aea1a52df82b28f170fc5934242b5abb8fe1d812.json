The night before, he was probably a bit quieter than he normally is. He's normally running around the house shouting, singing, annoying people, but he just sat there and then he went out for a bit. My mam said: 'I think he's a bit nervous for tomorrow.' I just said he'll be fine. From the first day he came in for pre-season he's been outstanding. All the lads would say that as well. He deserved his chance.\n\nMatt, did you get a good night\u2019s sleep before the United game?\n\nML: Better than I thought. I woke up pretty early and thought I\u2019d try and get back to sleep but it\u2019s playing on your mind, playing in the Premier League against Man Utd. It\u2019s like Christmas morning, as stupid as it sounds.\n\nThe brothers both featured in the recent victory over Manchester United Credit: getty images More\n\nIt must be special to spend your whole life with somebody and then step out onto a football pitch with them?\n\nSL: It\u2019s been amazing. I think to be able to do it as brothers, it just doesn\u2019t happen a lot. It fills us with pride. Just before the game, I looked across at Matty and I thought how worldwide the Premier League is and to have two brothers from North Shields at 19 and 21 starting a game is pretty crazy.\n\nYou have always been really hard-working, in football as well as at school. Why?\n\nML: It\u2019s a big thing that comes from our parents. They were pretty strict in school and if we got wrong [were told off] they weren\u2019t very happy. The way they brought us up, not just my mam and dad but as a family, nanna and grandpa and everything, they played a big part in how we grew up. They were pretty disciplined with us.\n\nIs it right you were both talented cricketers and might have gone down that path?\n\nSL: Matty was the best cricketer. I used to spend hours bowling at him and couldn\u2019t get him out. There was a time when he gave up football for a bit to see if he could make it at cricket. My dad had to have a little word with him saying \u2018I don\u2019t think you should do that\u2019. He made his own decision in the end. We do love our cricket.\n\nML: I remember when I was in the under-13s, I wasn\u2019t doing so well, but in cricket I was doing really well. People were saying I could go to the top. I told my dad I might concentrate on cricket and he gave me a clip round the ear for saying it, as if to say: \u2018There\u2019s not a chance that\u2019s happening.'\n\nSean, did you have the chance to go to Durham?\n\nSL: That was just recently, when I'd grown, I did get better at cricket and there was a finals day at Tynemouth. Some of the Durham coaches were asking the lads at Tynemouth, 'Who's that? Does he want to come and have a trial?'", "description": "They are two brothers with a shared childhood dream, the local lads who have given Newcastle United a timely lift after a summer of misery, but this is a story that should be cherished by football supporters everywhere.", "authors": ["Luke Edwards"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a_LeD1GhnYwu8ezRDG7YuA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00ODA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/9e8b14ea77e050bc22cd4a443d62d721", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
