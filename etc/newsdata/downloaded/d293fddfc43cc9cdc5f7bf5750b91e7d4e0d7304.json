Gavin Newsom outlines a three-part test that makes it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors who are not entitled to minimum wage and benefits like workers compensation.\n\nUber has argued that forcing its drivers to become employees would upend a business model that is built on flexibility. General counsel Tony West suggested to reporters that the ride-hailing company won\u2019t start treating its workers as employees come Jan. 1, instead defending its model if it faces legal challenges.\n\n\u201cJust because the test is hard does not mean we will not be able to pass it,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsom has pledged to sign the measure, but his office hopes to bring ride-hailing and meal delivery companies to the table with labor unions to negotiate a separate set of rules for workers who pick up jobs on their own schedules in the so-called gig economy.\n\nThe freshman governor faces a test of his ability to broker a compromise between powerful interest groups in Silicon Valley and organized labor. Steve Smith of the California Labor Federation, a sponsor of the legislation, said the companies so far haven\u2019t made acceptable proposals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to creating the conditions for (negotiations) to happen,\u201d Newsom spokesman Nathan Click said.\n\nIf Newsom signs the legislation, it could have national implications as politicians and businesses confront the shifting nature of work.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has indicated interest in pursuing a similar measure, and almost all the Democratic presidential contenders have offered similar proposals at the federal level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s forced the nation to take a look at what the future of work is going to look like,\u201d Democratic Assemblyman Ian Calderon of Whittier said in supporting the bill.\n\nThe measure would enshrine in law a 2018 California Supreme Court decision that makes it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors instead of employees. While the court\u2019s decision has set legal precedent since last year, the legislation provides enforcement tactics to the state and to city attorneys, who could sue companies they believe are failing to comply.\n\nBut Uber UBER, +1.46% , Lyft LYFT, +2.38% and delivery companies such as DoorDash and Postmates aren\u2019t ready to concede.\n\nUber and Lyft have already dumped $60 million into a committee for a ballot measure next year if Newsom doesn\u2019t broker a deal. They have said the ballot measure would set a base hourly wage, give workers access to benefits they can take with them to other companies and allow drivers to collectively bargain without making them employees.\n\nDoorDash, the meal delivery company, also has pledged $30 million.\n\nLyft spokesman Adrian Durbin would not comment on whether Lyft shares Uber\u2019s position that it will not reclassify its workers come Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cWe are fully prepared to take this issue to the voters of California to preserve the freedom and access drivers and riders want and need,\u201d Durbin said in a statement.\n\nThe legislation is likely of intense interest to the companies\u2019 investors \u2014 both Uber and Lyft are publicly traded. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors that the firm expects gig economy companies to push back and find middle ground.\n\nThe measure lays out a three-prong test to decide if workers can be labeled as contractors: The worker must be free from control of the company, perform work \u201coutside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business\u201d and be engaged in an independently established trade, occupation or business of the same nature of the work they are performing.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t perfect, but I think this goes a long way to protecting workers, legitimate small businesses, legitimate businesses that play by the rules, and we, as taxpayers, that have to clean up the mess when these businesses don\u2019t provide enough for their workers,\u201d said the bill\u2019s author, Democratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, her voice shaking with emotion.\n\nHer legislation had been the target of intense lobbying efforts, not just from gig economy companies. Because it would affect all job sectors, many have successfully pushed for exemptions.\n\nJobs excluded from the new test include doctors and dentists; licensed lawyers, architects, engineers and accountants; commercial fishermen; travel agents, marketing consultants, graphic designers, grant writers and others.\n\nCritics say by writing so many exceptions, the Legislature is unfairly picking winners and losers.", "description": "California lawmakers sent the governor a bill Wednesday that would give new wage and benefit protections to workers at so-called gig economy companies such...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR149_ab5_ca_ZG_20190911175136.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
