But obviously, if we have to, we will.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not willing to compromise on what we know is right and what we know we deserve and have already earned.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Best in the world: Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe win FIFA player of the year awards at Milan gala (VIDEO)\n\nThe US women\u2019s national team issued a lawsuit against US Soccer back in March, alleging gender discrimination with regard to earnings and working conditions.\n\nDiscussions between the two parties continued until August when they reached an impasse, and a trial date has been set for May 2020. The timing could prove a distraction ahead of the team\u2019s preparations for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, but it\u2019s something that Rapinoe says may be necessary to get the desired result.\n\n\u201cIt's certainly not ideal and it will take attention away and energy and effort away from what our actual job is, which is to play,\u201d she admitted.\n\n\u201cThis team also is very good at multitasking and taking a lot on its plate at all times.\n\n\u201cObviously we just went to the World Cup having filed the lawsuit a couple of months before and having to deal with that pressure.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com U.S. women's team celebrates World Cup triumph in New York City (VIDEO)\n\nBut, for now, Rapinoe has a different target in her sights, as she looks to capture her first National Women\u2019s Soccer League title. Her team, Reign FC, takes on North Carolina Courage in the NWSL semi-finals, and Rapinoe said she\u2019s relishing the cut and thrust of club soccer, where she faces her US teammates on a regular basis in club competition.\n\n\u201cWe all really enjoy going back to our respective club teams and having that rivalry with the other teams,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to two finals and I haven\u2019t won one yet so it\u2019s kind of on the bucket list.\u201d", "description": "FIFA women\u2019s player of the year Megan Rapinoe said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d that the US women\u2019s national team can strike a deal with US Soccer over their gender discrimination lawsuit, but also warned they're ready for a legal fight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da71548203027288639c8d8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
