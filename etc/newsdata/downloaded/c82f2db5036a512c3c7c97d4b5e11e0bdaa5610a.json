He is the firm's largest investor with 58 million shares worth $96bn.\n\nThe online shopping company revealed on Thursday evening that profits had fallen to $2.1bn during the three months to September, their first decline in more than two years.\n\nThis triggered a sharp sell-off of Amazon's shares during after-hours trade. Shares fell as much as 9pc last night, putting the company in line to see up to $80bn wiped from its overall market value.\n\nAmazon had said the 25pc profit decline had been down to a major investment in expanding its one-day delivery service, which Mr Bezos said was the \"right long-term decision for customers\".\n\nThe company said profits are likely to continue slipping in the fourth quarter as it is planning to spend around $1.5bn on one-day shipping, almost double the amount it spent in the three months to the end of June.", "description": "Jeff Bezos is set to lose his crown as the world's richest man, after an unexpected drop in profits at US internet titan Amazon sent shares spiralling.", "authors": ["Hannah Boland", "Robin Pagnamenta"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000211741500-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLiZnSJs8x6dOfuqFtiWqEYiWzUquApN372zGD-WHdjI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
