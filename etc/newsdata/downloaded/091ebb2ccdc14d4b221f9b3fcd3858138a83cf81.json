Ice losses from Antarctica have increased sea levels by almost 8mm (1/3 inch) since 1992, with two-fifths of this rise coming in the last five years alone. The finds mean people in coastal communities are at greater risk of losing their homes and becoming so-called climate refugees than previously feared. They are the result of a major climate assessment known as the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (Imbie). In one of the most complete pictures of Antarctic ice sheet change to date, an international team of 84 experts combined 24 satellite surveys to yield the results. Study co-leader Professor Andrew Shepherd, of Leeds University, said: 'We have long suspected that changes in Earth's climate will affect the polar ice sheets.\n\n\n\nOne of these calving events produced another usual phenomenon, a neatly rectangular ice berg the size of Delaraware called A-68.\n\n'The berg was so clean-cut that it was reasonable to assume it might have very recently calved from the Larsen C ice shelf,' NASA said, referring to another ice sheet near the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\n\nThe iceberg was spotted on October 16, 2018, during a flight for Operation IceBridge -NASA's long-running aerial survey of polar ice.\n\nDuring that day's survey of glaciers and ice shelves along the northern Antarctic Peninsula, scientist Jeremy Harbeck spotted the compelling berg.\n\nNot only were the edges of the iceberg extremely straight, but the two corners appeared 'squared off' at right angles.\n\nScientists used images from Landsat 8 and the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 to trace the berg back to its origins.\n\nThe berg cruised all the way north and through a narrow passage between the A-68's northern tip and a rocky outcrop near the ice shelf known as Bawden Ice Rise. NASA/UMBC glaciologist Chris Shuman likens this zone to a nutcracker.\n\nA-68 has repeatedly smashed against the rise and caused pieces of ice to splinter into clean-cut geometric shapes.\n\nBy November 2018 the iceberg had moved out of the rubble zone and into open water.\n\nShuman said: 'Now it's just another iceberg on its way to die.'\n\nA second rectangular berg, known as a 'tabular' iceberg, was spotted off the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, near the Larsen C ice shelf and close to the first one.\n\nIt is part of a large 'field of bergs NASA experts may have recently broken off the shelf, and say the sharp angles and flat surfaces are evidence the break occurred very recently.\n\nThe breakup produced a number of striking, tabular ice bergs.\n\nIn an interview with LiveScience, NASA scientist Kelly Brunt said 'tabular icebergs are rather like fingernails that crack of, giving them sharp edges.\n\nThe largest observed ice berg in the world, the B-15, was calved from Antarctica in March of 2000 and measured more than 4.200 square miles.\n\nBy last year, B-15 had drifted north toward South America and lost almost all of its mass, diminished to just 50 square nautical miles.", "description": "New images taken by the ESA's Copernicus Sentinel satellites shows two major new cracks in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
