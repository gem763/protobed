It reads:\n\nCharles Moore recounts the life of Britain's first female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher (pictured leaving Downing Street) in a third volume\n\nYou have no enemies, you say?\n\nAlas! My friend, the boast is poor;\n\nHe who has mingled in the fray\n\nOf duty, that the brave endure,\n\nMust have made foes! If you have none,\n\nSmall is the work that you have done.\n\nCombative to a fault, revelling in the battle, defiant to the end, happy to have made enemies because how else would the mighty task she had set herself of changing Britain for the better ever get done?\n\nHere is the very essence of the lady who proudly boasted she was not for turning.\n\nHer father, her role model, had dared her to be a Daniel in the lions\u2019 den, and she had not disappointed. Her experience was that the lions always backed off.\n\nYet the sheer weight of those enemies accumulated over 11 fiery years and three terms as Prime Minister would, in the end, be her downfall. Not the obvious enemies, though \u2014 the Galtieris and Scargills. They were successfully fought and consigned to history.\n\nIt was the foes closer to home, her colleagues and supposed friends, who, Brutus-like, plunged in the knife, leaving her shattered by the speed and venom of her defenestration.\n\nMargaret Thatcher's (pictured with her husband) reputation was highly damaged by a revamp of local taxation that was appallingly managed and presented\n\nHer demise was \u2014 as this outstanding, hugely readable biography shows \u2014 pure Shakespearean tragedy. The very virtues that made her great were also her vices. Inevitably, hubris led to nemesis.\n\nThis final part of Moore\u2019s trilogy \u2014 from Thatcher\u2019s record-breaking third general election victory in 1987, through to her ejection from office in November 1990 \u2014 is the denouement where, for all the hard-won success that had gone before, she got her comeuppance.\n\nParadoxically, the rest of the world adored and admired the Iron Lady. On a trip to Armenia, of all places, locals held up a banner declaring: \u2018You are the most beautiful and famous prime minister in the world.\u2019\n\nRonald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev agreed, in thrall to her strength of personality and purpose (though some other leaders begged not to sit next to her at state dinners because they knew she would lecture them non-stop).\n\n120 Number of hair appointments Mrs Thatcher had in a year\n\nAt home, however, she was losing the public\u2019s confidence, especially those in the \u2018just managing\u2019 category who had been her avid supporters. The poll tax \u2014 a revamp of local taxation that made sense on the surface, but was appallingly managed and presented \u2014 did much damage to her reputation.\n\nIt led to riots on the streets that left her baffled \u2014 as she saw it, she was simply preaching common sense. Opinion polls showed a slump in support for her, confirmed by losses in by-elections. Tory MPs, fearing for their seats, were whispering and levelling blame at her as an albatross around their necks.\n\nWhat really sank her, though, was not the poll tax. It was the contentious issue that, like Blackpool in a stick of rock, still runs through the heart of Tory party politics \u2014 Europe.\n\nThatcher grew increasingly sceptical of Britain getting too close to Brussels. \u2018We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain,\u2019 she thundered, \u2018only to see them reimposed [by] a European super-state\u2019. But her growing intransigence set her on a collision course with the bulk of her colleagues.\n\nMargaret Thatcher (pictured) would belittle and bully senior Cabinet figures including Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson\n\nThe very strength of her character that beguiled those foreign leaders had long caused serious ripples in her own Cabinet. These now became a tidal wave of resentment.\n\nShe didn\u2019t hold back, belittling and bullying senior Cabinet figures such as Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson, often in front of colleagues. She stopped bothering to listen, closing discussion on one contentious matter with an imperious \u2018I must prevail\u2019.\n\nFeeling excluded, miffed members of her Cabinet took to plotting behind her back \u2014 which became the sorry hallmark of the whole era.\n\nThe final whodunnit drama, told grippingly by Moore even though we know the outcome, was not an edifying one, as cabals of muttering male colleagues ratted on her. A deep current of misogyny underlay their actions, as it had throughout her political career.\n\nIn a challenge to her leadership of the party by Michael Heseltine, she won the first ballot by a comfortable margin, but was just four votes short of the numbers required for an out-and-out victory.\n\nA second ballot was necessary, in the run-up to which the politicking was feverish and deeply personal.\n\nOne of Margaret Thatcher's (pictured) aides discovered that she didn't have any money in her bank account after she left Downing Street\n\nCollectively, they wanted her gone, but nobody had the balls to tell her to her face. In one-to-one meetings with her, senior figures such as Kenneth Clark unctuously offered their personal support, but with the warning that \u2018most of the Cabinet think you should stand down as you are going to lose big\u2019.\n\nMoore is scathing in his condemnation. They couldn\u2019t even stab her in the front. But, seeing how the wind was blowing, she bowed to the inevitable and stood down \u2014 though she rightly never lost the feeling that she had been betrayed by turncoats; cast out by a coup.\n\nMoore concludes that the manner of her fall was a disaster which created \u2018an unforgettable, tragic spectacle of a woman\u2019s greatness overborne by the littleness of men\u2019.\n\nAs for the lady herself, the shock of leaving Downing Street, her home for the past 4,227 days, was immense. Moore draws a poignant and painful picture of what he calls \u2018the lioness in winter\u2019, shorn of her power, claws clipped and utterly lost.\n\nA personal assistant, Amanda Ponsonby, accompanied a teary Margaret and Denis from Westminster to their house in suburban Dulwich and found the fridge empty, not a scrap of food in sight. Days before, Mrs T had been dining in style with world leaders; now \u2018she and I sat in the kitchen. She was completely broken\u2019.\n\nHERSELF ALONE by Charles Moore (Allen Lane \u00a335, 1072 pp)\n\nAnd not just broken, but broke. \u2018There was no money in her bank account,\u2019 one of her aides discovered, \u2018and I mean no money.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019d paid for everything out of her prime ministerial salary. Denis, it seems, though comfortably off in his own right and beamingly proud of her, never voluntarily put his hand in his pocket for her from 1979 (when she became PM) to the day he died 24 years later.\n\nThrust back into everyday life, she struggled, baffled by the TV remote and direct dialling on the telephone. There\u2019d always been others to deal with such trivialities. When the hot water didn\u2019t work, she rang her ex-adviser Charles Powell, rather than a plumber, to fix it.\n\nShe struggled with being out of the loop. Why hadn\u2019t the U.S. secretary of state phoned her about Iraq? Why had her access to classified documents been revoked? Every morning, she\u2019d listen to some major problem being aired on the radio news at 7am, and, by 10am, had worked out a solution, but no one wanted to know.\n\nShe told a senior civil servant who came to visit that she woke feeling depressed, realising she was no longer prime minister. \u2018She couldn\u2019t get used to not taking decisions.\u2019\n\nThe money and domestic problems solved themselves. Old friends and admirers were generous, there was a massive book deal for her memoirs and she went on to earn a small fortune on the international lecture circuit. But the hurt she felt never really went away.", "description": "Charles Moore recounts the life of Margaret Thatcher in a third biography.
