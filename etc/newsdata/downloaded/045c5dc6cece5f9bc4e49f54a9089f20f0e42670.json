Until now.\n\nMonths after telling Time magazine he would \u201clove to broaden\u201d his core group of supporters, Trump appeared here on Monday for his first autumn campaign rally not tied to a congressional Republican candidate. This time, it was all about him and his ability to connect with new voters.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn New Mexico, that includes Hispanics \u2014 a demographic group the president repeatedly addressed during his hour-plus speech, touting economic gains that Hispanic communities have seen under his administration and their ability to understand border security \u201cbetter than other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot too long ago, I saw where the Hispanics were up with me in a poll \u2014 up by 17 percent \u2014 because the Hispanic Americans, they understand they don\u2019t want criminals coming across the border,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cThey don\u2019t want people taking their jobs.\u201d\n\nAccording to data provided by the Spanish-language network Univision, nearly half of New Mexico\u2019s newly registered voters in 2018 were Hispanic. Republicans in the state saw a 23 percent increase in Hispanic registrants from 2014 to 2018 \u2014 and Trump campaign officials said their internal numbers reflect that trend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve over-performed with the number of Hispanics showing up to rallies each week, and the polling we\u2019ve done today shows we can clearly win the state,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale told POLITICO as he mingled with supporters who arrived early for the president\u2019s rally. Asked why he has so far refused to release those figures publicly, Parscale said it\u2019s too early in the cycle to be parading out positive poll numbers.\n\nBut if the Trump campaign is trying to exercise caution in its effort to court voters outside the president\u2019s base, Monday marked an odd start. As a series of openers took the stage to rile up fans before the president arrived \u2014 including Sheriff Tony Mace of Cibola County, a Latino Trump supporter \u2014 they stressed the need for a border wall and cultural assimilation. When Trump took the stage, he returned to old campaign tactics \u2014 lobbing insults against The New York Times, CNN and The Washington Post, and making broad claims about his Democratic opponents and their positions on immigration, guns and abortion.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

If I had to put money on it, I don\u2019t think he will,\u201d Ramiro said, standing in line with a group of friends who joined him for the rally.\n\nArturo Perez, an undocumented immigrant from Juarez, Mexico, who was granted legal status under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act and later became a U.S. citizen, said he voted for President Barack Obama in 2012, but is open to supporting Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open to both parties as long as the policies make sense,\u201d Perez said, adding that none of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls had caught his attention yet.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats say the tax cuts aren\u2019t working for the regular person,\u201d Perez said. \u201cGuess what. I am a regular person and my salary is the highest it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign is betting that Hispanic voters like Perez will join independent voters in states like New Hampshire and Maine, where they believe the Democratic field\u2019s progressive policy prescriptions are less attractive, to widen the base the president can count on next November. On Monday, Trump said he also expected to expand his appeal among \u201cVenezuelans and Cubans\u201d in parts of Florida, which is largely seen as his firewall in 2020.\n\nParscale, for one, thinks the president is well on his way to a resounding reelection victory with the help of voters who either didn\u2019t back him or weren\u2019t eligible to cast ballots in 2016.\n\nPointing toward members of the media, he said on Monday, \u201cThey have in their little brains that we are shrinking, but right now the president\u2019s approval is over 50 [percent].\u201d His reference was to a survey released hours before Trump\u2019s rally by the polling group Rasmussen Reports \u2014 which has often been accused of having a bias toward conservative candidates and causes \u2014 putting the president at 50 percent approval among likely U.S. voters.\n\nTrump later said he couldn\u2019t see how the Land of Enchantment could vote for anyone but him next November, claiming that Democrats want to turn New Mexico \u201cinto a sanctuary state\u201d and can no longer compete with the wage growth American workers have seen under his administration.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing better than any state in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do I lose New Mexico? Explain that one. We\u2019re here for a number of reasons, but we\u2019re here because we really think we\u2019re going to turn this state.\u201d\n\nOther polls tell a different story about Trump\u2019s race to reelection \u2014 one that suggests the president will face an uphill battle as he takes his campaign message to other nontraditional battleground states in an effort to expand his base. A Morning Consult poll released in late August, for instance, found that Trump\u2019s net approval rating had decreased substantially in every key swing state since he took office.\n\nAccording to the president\u2019s critics, those numbers alone explain why Trump is venturing into New Mexico \u2014 a state that has voted Republican only once since 1992. With sinking approval ratings in states he carried in 2016 and a growing exodus of suburban women from the Republican Party, they say Trump has to make up for the support somewhere.\n\nBut Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M), who is retiring next November, said his state was an unusual place for the president to begin that effort.\n\n\u201cWhen [Trump] visits New Mexico tonight, he\u2019ll be visiting a state where we know that our diversity makes us stronger,\u201d Udall wrote in a tweet ahead of the rally here.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, you could learn a thing or two from New Mexico,\u201d he added. \u201cStop using your platform to divide us and incite bigotry. Show some real leadership.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico joins Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada and Minnesota as states the Trump campaign is targeting after the president lost them to Hillary Clinton in 2016. To win each state, Trump will have to capture new voters.\n\nOn Monday, hours after his campaign announced a series of new hires on the ground here, Trump said he was up for the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe will campaign for every vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to win in 2020.\u201d", "description": "Even the president\u2019s most ardent supporters are skeptical of his campaign\u2019s base-growing strategy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/62/fb/d8de67f1448684e3d4df89ae1bc5/190916-trump-rally-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
