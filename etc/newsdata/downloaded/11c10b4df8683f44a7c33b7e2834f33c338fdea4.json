Seems fitting.\n\nThe duke and duchess began their day by departing from Lahore Airport, where Middleton rocked a cream kurta by Elan (not available to the public until later this year) which featured navy blue piping. She paired the look with white trousers and nude J. Crew \u2018Lucie\u2019 high heels.\n\nSee the full look below.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the ensemble? Her Smythson Panama East West Zip Tote.\n\nThe roomy bag isn\u2019t what we're used to the duchess carrying, as she usually opts for a nude clutch or teeny evening bags.
