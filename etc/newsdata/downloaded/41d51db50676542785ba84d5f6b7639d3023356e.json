REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nBarnier spoke as Britain was headed for a Dec. 12 national election that Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes will unlock the Brexit stalemate after his factious parliament refused to swiftly ratify his divorce deal with the EU.\n\n\u201cThe risk of Brexit happening without a ratified deal still exists,\u201d Barnier told a speech in Brussels. \u201cWe still need to prepare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn all member states, there is a big difference in preparedness between bigger companies and SMEs. It\u2019s not time to become complacent. Work with SMEs in particular needs to continue,\u201d he said, referring to small and medium enterprises.\n\nHe said a no-deal split could happen at the end of January, if the British parliament failed to ratify Johnson\u2019s deal and London did not get another delay on the divorce.\n\nIt could also happen at the end of the status-quo transition period envisaged after Brexit until the end of 2020, Barnier said, if no new trade deal is agreed between the two sides by then and no extra time is given to achieve that.\n\nThe Frenchman warned there was precious little time between the Brexit day and the end of 2020 to agree a new trade deal.\n\n\u201cIt will be a difficult and demanding set of negotiations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time we have at hand to conclude this negotiation will be extremely short, 11 months.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of our geographic closeness and our economic independence... we want to have solid guarantees on the level-playing field aspects.\u201d\n\nBarnier warned the bloc will only give Britain as much access to its single market after Brexit as is justified by London ensuring that EU rules and standards are preserved.\n\n\u201cWe will keep a close watch and be extremely vigilant on ... social rights, environmental protection, state aid and obviously on issues of taxation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want zero tariffs, zero quotas and zero dumping.\u201d", "description": "The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday the risk of Britain's chaotic departure from the bloc without a divorce agreement still existed, and that future trade talks would be \"difficult and demanding\".", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446576529&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1AW", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
