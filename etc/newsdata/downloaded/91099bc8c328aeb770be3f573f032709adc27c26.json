Donald Trump announced that he is removing the U.S. signature from the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and requesting the Senate end its advice and consent process on the treaty and return it to him. Heritage Foundation Pres. Kay Coles James released the following statement lauding Trump\u2019s decision:\n\n\u201cThe United States should only be party to agreements that advance our national interests and strengthen America on the global stage. The Arms Trade Treaty does neither. It would only constrain law-abiding nations and is incapable of reining in bad actors. The president has made the right and responsible decision, and one that Heritage analysts have long advocated. His action defends the Constitution and the sovereignty of the United States and ensures that its arms export policies remain where they belong: in the hands of the American government and the American people.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Today, Pres.\u00a0Donald Trump announced that he is removing the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
