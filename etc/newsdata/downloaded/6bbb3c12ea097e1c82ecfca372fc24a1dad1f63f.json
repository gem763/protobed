Speaking after the competition's inaugural draft, Kirsten offered up his insistence on taking regular time away as a potential reason for being overlooked.\n\n'It would have been a great opportunity, very exciting. I wouldn't have flown across the world if it wasn't,' he said.\n\n'I've always wanted to be involved in English cricket. I only came over because I was excited by the opportunity. I didn't get a huge amount of feedback so the only thing I can think of is that I was fairly high risk.\n\n'My kids are little and I placed a huge importance on being able to see them as regularly as I could.\n\nKirsten will now turn his attentions to coaching new hundred ball franchise Welsh Fire\n\n'But I discussed it with my wife, we've done it before with India so we know the space, and we said \"we'll make it work if we can\".\n\n'It is hectic, without a doubt, probably 250 days year away from home. I'd love to get back in to international cricket but I'm not bothered by the decision, everyone makes the call they need to.\n\n'It's great to be part of The Hundred, actually. I was going to lose that if I got the England job and this will be exciting.'\n\nKirsten will be in charge of England World Cup winners Jonny Bairstow and Liam Plunkett at the Cardiff-based team, and also added Australia pair Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc during the televised draft.", "description": "Former South Africa and India coach Gary Kirsten lost out to Chris Silverwood in his bid to become the new England cricket coach after Trevor Bayliss left the post this summer.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/00/20011660-0-image-a-64_1571698821801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
