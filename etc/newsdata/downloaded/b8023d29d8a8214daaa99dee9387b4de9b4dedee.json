Bit weird\u2026\n\n.@jodiecomer was only 4 years old the last time @BenAffleck and #MattDamon worked together for #GoodWillHunting, but she\u2019ll star alongside the two in Ridley Scott\u2019s new film #TheLastDuel: \u201cIt\u2019s insane\u201d #NYCC pic.twitter.com/8KlqCAKVTt \u2014 MTV NEWS (@MTVNEWS) October 8, 2019\n\nAsked if she was aware just how big her age gap with Matt and Ben was, the actress joked: \u2018No, but I\u2019m going to bring that up.\u2019\n\nLaughing, she continued: \u2018I\u2019ll let you know how that goes down. Probably lose my job.\u2019\n\nWhile little is known about The Last Duel beyond its vague plot outline, many people admitted to feeling a little uneasy about the film when it was announced in July, due to its perceived use of female trauma to further the male characters\u2019 stories.\n\nIn particular, many fans were disappointed to hear that Jodie was attached to the project, having played such an iconic, independent woman in Killing Eve.\n\n\u2018Oh, neat, so she\u2019s playing the daughter of one of them, that is so- *checks notes* oh, the wife,\u2019 one wrote, \u2018She\u2019s playing the WIFE of one of them. FUN.\u2019\n\nOh, neat, so she's playing the daughter of one of them, that is so- *checks notes* oh, the wife. She's playing the WIFE of one of them. FUN. https://t.co/sVFQOc2nDQ \u2014 Rachel Hawkins (@LadyHawkins) October 9, 2019\n\nQueen Jodie deserves so much better than those middle-aged, middle-of-the-road frat boys pic.twitter.com/daUg45Wi0b \u2014 Sami Feminist Killjoy Lee (@divasamilee) October 9, 2019\n\nI love you Jodie but the plot is horrible and you can do so much better than this pic.twitter.com/f7KdoH2ixg \u2014 Shippers Gonna Ship (@kemalineee) October 9, 2019\n\nHowever, Jodie only had good things to say about the project, explaining: \u2018To work with Ridley, it\u2019s just insane. When I read the script, I loved the script.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The character is this remarkable woman who risked her own life and reclaimed her life in the process and I\u2019m so excited, honestly.\u2019\n\nOK Jodie, we\u2019re trusting you on this one\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
