Fans had yet to see the newborn until Wednesday when Fox posted a picture to Instagram of her lying next to Journey. USA TODAY\n\nMegan Fox and husband Brian Austin Green shared a rare Halloween treat this weekend.\n\nThe family was in Disneyland and decked out for the holiday, and Fox, 33, actually managed to get some photos of all three kids: Noah, 7, Bodhi, 5, and Journey, 3.\n\nOf course, she had the usual mom lament. She posted several photos to Instagram, along with the caption, \"Halloween at @disneyland is always the most fun but can I get ONE family photo where everyone is looking at the camera and making a semi normal face ??\"\n\nIn the first photo, the actress and her sons pose in front of a Ferris wheel, with red dragon Journey obviously more interested in something else.\n\nWant your Halloween horror-filled or Not-So-Scary? Pick your poison at Disney or Universal\n\nMore: Megan Fox is raising a confident son who 'loves' wearing dresses, doesn't care what others say\n\nThe other two photos show the family a little more put together, with Journey in Dad's arms and Mom in her flower-decked mouse ears. Noah is wearing an awesome witch costume complete with hot-pink wig. Bodhi's costume might be a skeleton (?).\n\nGreen, 46, wore the tried-and-true father costume: jeans and a black tee.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/13/megan-fox-shares-sweet-halloween-photos-kids-brian-austin-green/3971163002/", "description": "Megan Fox and husband Brian Austin Green shared a rare Halloween treat this weekend: photos of their three kids, Noah, 7, Bodhi, 5, and Journey, 3.", "authors": ["Susan Haas", "Published P.M.
