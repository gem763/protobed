And, wow, look at that! Look at that! Hey, is that Darth Vader up there?\"\n\nIt is Darth Vader up there!\n\nA Medusa and Darth Vader peer down from the upper heights of the National Cathedral. CBS News\n\nCrane your neck at the cathedral, or even take one of their gargoyle tours, and you might also see a wild boar, a turtle, a dragon, or one of the roughly 1,200 other roof dwellers.\n\nOne of Alonso's creations was his \"girl,\" a Medusa.\n\n\"But you didn't look at her?\" asked correspondent Faith Salie.\n\n\"No, we just put her up in place.\"\n\nBut many of the Medusa's neighbors, like Darth Vader, aren't really gargoyles\u2026\n\n\"A gargoyle officially must spew water or be able to do so,\" said Janetta Rebold Benton, a professor of art history at Pace University in New York, who has written about these hair-raising hobgoblins. \"I describe them as glorified gutters. If you look like a gargoyle in some sort of a monstrous or fantastic way but you cannot spew water, you are officially a 'grotesque.'\n\n\"They're fascinating,\" said Benton. \"And I think it goes along with the whole appeal of things that are just a little awful, a little bit frightening, a little bit creepy \u2013 the extreme edge of what we accept. And it's part of human nature, curiously.\"\n\nA dragon perched on the National Cathedral. CBS News\n\nThe word gargoyle comes from the French gargouille, which means \"to gargle.\" \"And that is, of course, what a gargoyle does; it spits water from its throat,\" Benton said.\n\nAncient civilizations like the Greeks were carving water spitters over two thousand years ago, but Benton said gargoyles really came alive in the middle ages.\n\nBesides water control, they've been said to ward off evil and to frighten passers-by into piety. Some even think of them as monstrous angels, created to delight God.\n\nCarver Walter S. Arnold told Salie gargoyles have always stuck their necks out to push cultural boundaries. \"I think the bishops knew that, if you didn't give us the outlet on the outside of the cathedral, we'd be sticking a caricature of the bishop behind the altar,\" he laughed. \"So, they defined that you have to behave here, and you can talk about life and culture and society out there.\"\n\nCarver Walter S. Arnold creating a new creature. CBS News\n\nArnold has carved dozens of gargoyles and grotesques for the National Cathedral, and for him, the joy of creating them lies in the whimsy they inspire.\n\n\"Most of what carvers do is much more formal,\" he said. \"Whereas gargoyles, for me, are more like jazz. There's a concept and you can improvise and just kind of discover what's in the stone as I go along.\"\n\nHe often collaborated with sculptor Jay Hall Carpenter, who's designed more than a hundred of these creatures for the National Cathedral.\n\nOne design that Carpenter and Arnold created together was called \"The Crooked Politician.\" \"He's tampering with the scales of justice,\" said Carpenter.\n\nPretty apt for a gargoyle that looks over Washington, D.C.!\n\nThis crooked politician gargoyle is right at home at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. CBS News\n\nAs we look up in wonder at these haunting, devilish, cheeky creatures, Janetta Rebold Benton suggested what we should consider as we gaze skyward: \"Consider the fantastic. Consider the appeal of things that you cannot fully understand today, things that perhaps will ultimately have an explanation. And even if they don't, enjoy them just for the pleasure they convey.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Aria Shavelson.", "description": "The mischievous creatures that decorate the upper reaches of the National Cathedral, in Washington, D.C., range from the menacing (Medusa, Darth Vader) to the cheeky (a crooked politician)", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/26/e0d528a5-0f97-4d07-a2c7-d246081cebba/thumbnail/1200x630/ebba3dd2d0ba809315df50a42a8f69be/gargoyles-the-crooked-politician-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
