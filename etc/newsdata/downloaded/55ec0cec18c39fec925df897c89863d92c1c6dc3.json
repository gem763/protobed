He returned from the injured list Sunday as rosters expanded, yet the play of those who replaced him means he returned to a limited role \u2014 starting against some left-handers but probably mostly coming off the bench.\n\nOn Sunday at Nationals Park, the future didn\u2019t matter to the franchise\u2019s foundation. The present was enough. Zimmerman delivered one of the brightest moments of his season \u2014 a 437-foot moonshot home run to left field in the sixth inning \u2014 to push the Nationals to a 9-3 victory that secured a series sweep of the Miami Marlins and gave Washington its ninth win in 10 games.\n\nIn Zimmerman\u2019s first trip through the team\u2019s post-homer dugout dance line, he pantomimed using a walker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old,\u201d the 34-year-old said, grinning. \u201cDancing\u2019s not really my thing, but [I] got to do it.\u201d\n\nHis teammates, who jokingly called him a September call-up, appreciated the effort.\n\n\u201cObviously his body has taken a hit, but he\u2019s working at it,\u201d Anthony Rendon said. \u201cEach and every day, he\u2019s been [in the minor leagues rehabbing], so for him to grind back to it and his first day hit a ball like that, it was awesome. We loved it when he danced.\u201d\n\n[Analysis: Sean Doolittle is a great teammate, but the Nationals need him to be a great closer, too]\n\nThe distance between the starring role Zimmerman once held and the player he is now is apparent. His blast was a small piece of the team\u2019s win, and it came an inning after Rendon broke his franchise record for single-season RBI with 111. Rendon is a National League MVP candidate, a heightened version of the sweet-swinging third baseman that Zimmerman was in the early days of this franchise.\n\nThe record was a small nod to the torch of franchise cornerstone that has passed from Zimmerman to Bryce Harper to Rendon. Juan Soto \u2014 the 20-year-old phenom who could be next in line if Rendon departs in free agency \u2014 added two doubles and a home run.\n\nZimmerman downplayed his return, saying he felt good, calling it \u201cfun\u201d to be back on the field and promising he would do whatever it took to win. But his teammates respected what it took to get here. Manager Dave Martinez praised his diligent work in rehab and said the home run \u201creally electrified everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cZim has a lot left to give when he\u2019s healthy,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe get a guy back now in a pivotal point where, if he can get hot in [the middle of the lineup], he can carry us.\u201d\n\nThis cloudy day in Nationals Park felt slightly cooler, somewhat charged. It was the first day of September, and the playoff push that had seemed far off suddenly felt near. The NL wild-card game, which the Nationals are angling toward as the home team, was exactly one month away.\n\nThe significance of the day did not overwhelm Martinez. There were more players in his clubhouse \u2014 seven players rejoined the team, including Sean Doolittle, Jeremy Hellickson and Zimmerman \u2014 yet his mind-set stayed the same. Martinez preached the desire to go 1-0 and reiterated that everyone understood \u201cwe need to win the game at hand \u2014 every day.\u201d\n\nThen again, nothing has derailed Martinez from his message this season. Perhaps that\u2019s a major reason the Nationals, once the second-worst team in the NL at 19-31, are now in position to contend. The Chicago Cubs\u2019 loss Sunday means the Nationals hold a 4\u00bd -game cushion for the top wild-card spot.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; probably should have fired Davey,\u201d Zimmerman deadpanned when asked to explain the turnaround. Then he added, seriously, \u201cThat\u2019s why you play 162.\u201d\n\n[Boswell: The Nats simply can\u2019t let Anthony Rendon \u2014 his bat, his glove, his personality \u2014 get away ]\n\nOne of the other major reasons \u2014 the rotation \u2014 showed up Sunday. Patrick Corbin mixed fastballs and sliders to mow down the Marlins\u2019 lineup his first time through. He ended the fourth inning by striking out Garrett Cooper for the second time, his seventh of the game and 200th of the season. The Nationals have three pitchers (Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Corbin) with at least 200 strikeouts for the first time in franchise history and are the first NL team to have such a trio since the Houston Astros in 1969.\n\nEverything changed in the fifth when the Marlins jumped on Corbin\u2019s slider and fastball to seize a 3-2 lead. In the left-hander\u2019s previous outing, Tuesday against the Baltimore Orioles, he allowed two runs in the first inning and then watched as his teammates flailed at the plate. This time, he needn\u2019t have worried.\n\nRendon\u2019s two-run shot in the bottom of the fifth gave the Nationals the lead back, and they wouldn\u2019t relinquish it. Zimmerman had his homer in the sixth, a two-run shot. Catcher Yan Gomes homered in that inning, too, and the bullpen and defense ensured the lead held. Zimmerman did his part defensively, ranging for throws and looking spry as he chased foul balls down the right field line. He went so hard that Martinez spoke to him about being cautious.\n\n\u201cI have to tell him, \u2018You\u2019re not 22, 23,\u2019 \u201d Martinez said. \u201c \u2018Just push back a little bit and do smart things and not try to play 100 mph every pitch, every single at-bat, because we need you on the field.\u2019 \u201d\n\nZimmerman wants to be here, too. This group reminds him of 2012. He understands as well as anyone in the organization that this team\u2019s success up to now means nothing, but still: Something feels different. Zimmerman explained the mood in the dugout when the Nationals trail \u2014 no adversity feels too great \u2014 and, in that way, described his own season.\n\n\u201cYou just have that feeling that you\u2019re going to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cJust got to keep it going.\u201d", "description": "The franchise icon, fresh off the injured list, slugged a two-run homer as the Nats won, 9-3, for their ninth victory in 10 games.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RTD-zkT8APNSFB7b1afh6C0CUBo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NVULJSWM7QI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
