Yet hedge funds Elliott Management Corp. and Knight Vinke have just succeeded in squeezing a high price from the one keen buyer of their combined 21% holding, the Finnish utility Fortum Oyj.\n\nInvestors sitting on the other 30% not already owned by Fortum can only look on in dismay and ask how they missed out.\n\nFortum made a takeover bid for Uniper in 2017 but had to settle for a stake just below 50% after it emerged that Moscow had an effective veto on it gaining control (the German company owns a water facility in Russia and Fortum is controlled by the Finnish state, hence Russia\u2019s right to block the deal).\n\nAll of a sudden, something has changed. Fortum sees a potential path to Russian approval, although it won\u2019t say precisely what it is. The Finnish company has agreed therefore to pay 2.3 billion euros ($2.5 billion) for the position held by Elliott and Knight Vinke. That would give it a 71% stake, assuming Russia\u2019s approval is forthcoming.\n\nFor Elliott, it\u2019s a classic short-term win from opportunistically buying into a bid target. For Knight Vinke, it\u2019s the profitable culmination of a longstanding activist campaign that began with nudging the German power giant E.ON SE to carve out Uniper in a demerger three years ago.\n\nAs for Fortum, it\u2019s a victory of sorts in a war of attrition with Uniper\u2019s management. The Finns look set to gain de facto control. Key shareholder votes in German companies require 75% approval and Fortum would almost certainly clear that hurdle, gaining the power to appoint directors to Uniper\u2019s supervisory board, who in turn oversee the management board. True, Fortum can\u2019t fully integrate the German business into its own company. But it will get to direct Uniper\u2019s strategy and receive dividend payments to cover the cost of its stake.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing here for Uniper minority investors, though. They were hoping to get a fresh takeover offer from Fortum, made available to all shareholders. Either that or a so-called \u201cdomination agreement\u201d whereby Fortum got full access to Uniper\u2019s cash flow in return for paying minority shareholders a chunky dividend. Fortum says it has no plans to make a fresh bid and won\u2019t seek a domination agreement for at least two years. Why would it?\n\nIt would have been better if Uniper had extracted some sort of agreed deal with Fortum. The German target appears to have relied on the Russian water asset being a poison pill. Fortum seems to have found a way around that. But with Fortum having a blocking stake and the hedge funds agitating for an exit, negotiating a grand bargain between all the stakeholders would have been the best way forward for Uniper.\n\nMinority investors are always in a tough spot when the register includes other big beasts, especially when one is a strategic bidder and another is Elliott. The episode is a reminder that sometimes their interests are best served by management not fighting too hard.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nChris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.
