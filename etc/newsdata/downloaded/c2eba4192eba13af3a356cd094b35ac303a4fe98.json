Four years later, she\u2019s considering his rival.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the time that we have to go Conservative,\u201d Khoda said after attending a boisterous all-candidates debate at a community center in Richmond Hill, Ontario, a city just north of Toronto. \u201cThe Liberals are going to lose seats.\u201d\n\nLike Ohio in the U.S., the sprawling suburbs around Toronto will likely dictate who will win the Oct. 21 election. After sweeping the diverse, immigrant-rich region four years ago, the Liberals are in facing a difficult battle against Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer in the bellwether region known for its 905 area code.\n\nWhile polls tip Trudeau to win the most seats, his party is riding neck and neck with the Conservatives in the popular vote. If the Liberals sink to a minority government, or lose the election, chances are it will be because Trudeau lost support in this key area over his handling of foreign policy issues such as Iran and China, and the soaring cost of living.\n\nKhoda came to the evening debate seeking answers from Liberal incumbent Majid Jowhari on his position of resuming ties with Iran -- a country she fled 33 years ago -- even though she has made her choice. The Liberals\u2019 views on Iran, and \u201cupsetting\u201d efforts dealing with the U.S. on trade, led her to switch support to Conservative candidate Costas Menegakis\n\nOthers packing the gym suggest a close two-way battle between the Liberals and Conservatives in a riding pollsters say favors the incumbents.\n\n\u201cI think Majid Jowhari has a good chance,\u201d said Mohammad Mahmoudzadeh, 66, chairman of a local construction firm, though he no longer expects the Liberals to win a majority government.\n\nThe Richmond Hill riding has about 110,000 people with a median total household income of C$73,563 ($55,245), similar to Ontario\u2019s provincial average. Three out of every five people here are immigrants, of which 72% are from Asia -- led by China, Iran and Hong Kong, according to the country\u2019s statistics agency. Almost two thirds of the population view themselves as \u201cfirst generation\u201d Canadians.\n\nSurburban Issues\n\nRichmond Hill is one of 25 ridings in the 905 that includes the cities of Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan and Markham. They\u2019re family-oriented communities whose homeowners carry large mortgages, leaving little left over for spending elsewhere and often commute to Toronto for work, where lack of public transit is a perennial complaint.\n\nIn 2015, the Liberals captured all of Toronto\u2019s 25 ridings and all but three of the suburban districts, helping Trudeau win a majority government with 184 of the 338 seats in Parliament. But the seats often flip. In 2011, Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives captured most of the suburbs and parts of Toronto to gain a majority. The two regions together make up 50 seats, accounting for 15% of the entire country.\n\n\u201cSince the early 1960s the suburban belt around Toronto has determined which party comes to power and whether it\u2019s going to be a majority or minority,\u201d Nelson Wiseman, a University of Toronto political science professor who specializes in Canadian politics, said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd in this election, the Liberals are going to sustain significant losses -- they might lose half of those seats.\u201d\n\nWinning this region involves swinging votes by a couple percentage points and the Liberals are playing defense versus 2015, when Trudeau\u2019s \u201cSunny Ways\u201d mantra of hope appealed to Canadians wanting change after nearly a decade of Conservative rule, Wiseman said. He anticipates lower voter turnout this time, especially among younger Canadians, which favors the Conservatives since they tend to gain the older vote.\n\nThe Liberals and Conservatives are in a dead heat in the second-last week of the campaign. They each have 34% support, according to aggregate polling averages compiled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., with the New Democratic Party in third at 14%. Trudeau was projected to win 153 seats as of Tuesday.\n\nAt Hillcrest Mall, one of Richmond Hill\u2019s biggest shopping centers, voters were divided. For Soroush Yousefi, 23, voting Conservative is a no-brainer even though he backed Trudeau four years earlier.
