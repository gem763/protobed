It was only by chance, 17 years later, that the stolen child discovered her true identity.\n\nIt was the first day of term at Zwaanswyk High School in Cape Town and the beginning of Mich\u00e9 Solomon's final year.\n\nAnd that January day in 2015, 17-year-old Mich\u00e9 was mobbed by other students excitedly telling her about the new girl, Cassidy Nurse, who was three years younger but looked almost identical to her.\n\nInitially, Mich\u00e9 didn't think much of it.\n\nBut when the two girls later met in the corridor, Mich\u00e9 says she felt an instant connection she couldn't explain.\n\n\"I almost felt like I knew her,\" she says. \"It was so scary - I couldn't understand why I was feeling like this.\"\n\nDespite the age difference, Mich\u00e9 and Cassidy began spending a lot of time together.\n\n\"I would say, 'Hey, baby girl!' And she would say, 'Hey, big sis!'\" Mich\u00e9 recalls. \"Sometimes I would go to the bathroom with her and say, 'Let me brush your hair, let me fix you up with some lip gloss.'\"\n\nImage copyright Mpho Lakaje Image caption Mich\u00e9 Solomon today\n\nWhen anyone asked Mich\u00e9 and Cassidy if they were sisters they would joke, \"We don't know - maybe in another life!\"\n\nThen one day the two girls took a selfie together and showed it to their friends. Some asked Mich\u00e9 if she was sure she hadn't been adopted. \"No! Don't be crazy!\" she insisted.\n\nThen Mich\u00e9 and Cassidy went home and showed their families the picture, too. Lavona, Mich\u00e9's mother, who called her daughter \"Princess\" and would take her to the mall and to the movies, commented on how similar the two girls looked.\n\nMichael, Mich\u00e9's father, said that he recognised his daughter's new friend - Cassidy's father had an electrical store where he sometimes shopped.\n\nBut Cassidy's parents, Celeste and Morne Nurse, gazed intensely at the photograph. They told Cassidy they had a question for Mich\u00e9, and when the two girls next met Cassidy came out with it: \"Were you born on 30 April 1997?\"\n\n\"I said, 'Why? Are you stalking me on Facebook?'\" Mich\u00e9 says.\n\nCassidy assured Mich\u00e9 that she wasn't stalking her, she just wanted to know when Mich\u00e9 had been born. So Mich\u00e9 replied that yes, she had been born on 30 April 1997.\n\nFind out more\n\nMich\u00e9 Solomon spoke to Mpho Lakaje on Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nListen again here or download the Outlook podcast\n\nWeeks later, Mich\u00e9 was unexpectedly summoned from her maths lesson to the headmaster's office, where two social workers were waiting. They told Mich\u00e9 a story about a three-day-old baby girl called Zephany Nurse, who had been abducted from Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town 17 years previously and had never been found.\n\nMich\u00e9 listened to the story unfold, feeling unsure why they were telling her this. Then the social workers explained that there was evidence to suggest that Mich\u00e9 could be the child who had been taken, all those years ago.\n\nTo set matters straight, Mich\u00e9 explained that she hadn't been born at the Groote Schuur Hospital - she had been born at the Retreat Hospital, about 20 minutes' drive away. That's what was on her birth certificate, she said. But the social workers replied that there was no record of her being born there.\n\nImage caption Lavona Solomon pictured at home with the newborn Mich\u00e9\n\nStill feeling that this must all be some terrible mistake, Mich\u00e9 agreed to a DNA test.\n\n\"I had so much belief in the mother who raised me - she would never lie to me, especially about who I am and where I come from,\" Mich\u00e9 says. \"So my mind was made up that the DNA test was going to be negative.\"\n\nBut things did not go as she hoped. The test results came back the following day and proved indisputably that Mich\u00e9 Solomon and Zephany Nurse, the baby snatched from the Groote Schuur Hospital in 1997, were the same person.\n\n\"I sat there in shock,\" Mich\u00e9 says. \"My life was out of control.\"\n\nThe story of the stolen baby, now a young woman on the brink of adulthood, being found quite by chance almost two decades later made headlines in South Africa and around the world and Mich\u00e9's life changed immediately.\n\nShe was told that she would be unable to return home - it would be another three months before she would turn 18 and be allowed to make her own decisions. For now she had to stay in a safe house.\n\nThen Mich\u00e9 received more devastating news. Lavona Solomon, the woman she had grown up believing was her mother, had been arrested.\n\n\"That broke me,\" Mich\u00e9 recalls. \"I needed her. I needed to ask her, 'Why? What's going on?' I was so overwhelmed that I belonged to someone else.\"\n\nImage caption Eight-month-old Mich\u00e9 with Michael\n\nMich\u00e9 was present when Lavona's husband, Michael - the man Mich\u00e9 regarded as her father - was questioned by police.\n\n\"I could see the stress in his face, I could see the bloodshot in his eyes and I was really scared,\" Mich\u00e9 says.\n\nThe police wanted to know whether he was part of the kidnapping plot.\n\n\"My father is soft and he's gentle,\" Mich\u00e9 says. \"But he's my rock, he's my hero, he's my daddy, he's the man. And here's this other man making him look like such a small child, while my father's saying, 'No, I didn't do this. Mich\u00e9 is my daughter - how can she not be my daughter? I wasn't part of this.'\"\n\nThe police never found evidence that Michael Solomon had known that Mich\u00e9 had been taken from her biological parents without permission and he was released.\n\nMichael says that Lavona had been pregnant. It's thought that she concealed a miscarriage and then faked the remainder of her pregnancy, before stealing Zephany Nurse, bringing her home and pretending she had given birth to the baby herself.\n\nAnd now Lavona Solomon was in custody, awaiting trial on charges of kidnapping and fraudulently claiming to be the mother of a child.\n\nImage copyright Huisgenoot/Noncedo Mathibela Image caption Celeste Nurse (left) and her second-born child, Cassidy\n\nAlthough Celeste and Morne Nurse had gone on to have three more children, they'd never stopped looking for their first born, Zephany, and had celebrated her birthday every year - even after they had divorced.\n\nBut all the while their stolen child had been growing up nearby. The Solomon home is just 5km from the Nurses' - as a small child, Mich\u00e9 would run around on the field opposite the Nurses' house, while Michael played soccer.\n\nNow, after an extraordinary turn of events, the Nurse family's prayers had been answered. Mich\u00e9 was reunited with her biological parents at a police station with social workers on hand.\n\n\"They hugged me and squeezed me and started crying,\" Mich\u00e9 says. But she wasn't comfortable. Something didn't feel right.\n\n\"I was like, 'Just go with it because it's a shame for these people, they have been through a lot,'\" she says. \"It's sad, but you know, I felt nothing, I didn't feel that I'd missed them.\"\n\nMich\u00e9 was in emotional turmoil. One set of parents were elated and desperate to make up for lost time, but strangers to her. The others - the ones she loved - were devastated, and one of them was behind bars.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Lavona Solomon (with her face covered) arriving at the Cape Town High Court during her trial\n\nLavona Solomon's trial at the high court in Cape Town began in August 2015. Both Mich\u00e9 and her biological parents were there to hear Lavona's testimony.\n\nThroughout the trial, Lavona Solomon denied any wrongdoing. She told the court of her numerous attempts to conceive\u201a a number of miscarriages and her desperation to adopt a child. Lavona then said she had been offered a baby by a woman called Sylvia who had been giving her fertility treatment. Sylvia had told Lavona that the baby belonged to a young girl who was not interested in keeping it and wanted the baby to be adopted. But there was no evidence that Sylvia existed.\n\nFurthermore, almost two decades after the incident, a witness who remembered seeing the woman dressed as a nurse who carried baby Zephany away as Celeste lay sleeping, picked Lavona Solomon out in an identity parade. The judge concluded that the evidence against her was overwhelming.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Morne Nurse, Zephany's biological father, leaving court after the guilty verdict\n\nIn 2016, Lavona Solomon was sentenced to 10 years in jail for kidnapping, fraud and violating the Children's Act. The judge criticised her for showing no remorse during the trial.\n\n\"I felt like death was happening to me,\" Mich\u00e9 says. \"I was like, 'How am I gonna cope? How am I going to get through life without the mother that I had every day in my life?'\"\n\nLater that year, Mich\u00e9 visited Lavona in prison and was able to speak to her for the first time since the social workers had arrived at her school.\n\n\"The first visit was behind a window, it was not a contact visit,\" Mich\u00e9 says. \"And I saw my mother in the clothing that female prisoners wear and it broke my heart. I cried and cried.\"\n\nMich\u00e9 really wanted to know the truth, to find out what had happened on the day that Lavona had taken her from her mother in hospital.\n\n\"I told her, 'By knowing I'm not your blood - that I actually belong to someone else, and that you've robbed them of possibilities and changed my whole destiny - hurts me. How am I supposed to believe your word when you've lied to me, saying that I am your child? You broke your trust with me. You are going to have to come clean if you want to have a relationship with me.'\n\n\"And she said, 'One day, I will tell you.'\n\n\"She still says that she didn't do it, but I think she did.\"\n\nHowever, Mich\u00e9 says she doesn't hold any grudges.\n\n\"Forgiving brings so much healing into your heart,\" Mich\u00e9 says. \"Life must go on. She knows that I forgive her, and she knows that I still love her.\"\n\nIt has now been more than four years since Mich\u00e9 discovered the truth about her identity. When she turned 18 at the end of April 2015, she considered moving in with one of her biological parents, but decided against it.\n\n\"They were divorced, that family unit had been messed up,\" Mich\u00e9 says. \"So I went for the obvious decision and the stablest decision - to move back in with Michael, that was my safe space, that was my home.\"\n\nMich\u00e9 has struggled to form a relationship with her biological family, and says that at times she even felt that she hated them for taking her \"mother\" away.\n\nImage caption Michael with Mich\u00e9's daughter on the way to visit Lavona in prison\n\nShe still visits Lavona in prison in Worcester, about 120km from where she lives, but it's a long drive, especially now that she has two children of her own.\n\nLavona Solomon is due for release in six years and Mich\u00e9 says she often wishes time would \"hurry up\". She's still living in the family home, and waiting for her mother to return.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Mich\u00e9 Solomon has chosen to keep the name that she was raised with rather than the one with which she was born. But somehow, despite the psychological catastrophe of discovering that the woman who raised her had actually stolen her, she has somehow made peace with both of her identities.\n\n\"I think I hated Zephany in the beginning,\" Mich\u00e9 says.\n\n\"She came with such force, such an uninvited invitation, so much suffering and so much pain. But Zephany is the truth and Mich\u00e9, the 17-year-old girl that I was, she was a lie. So I've managed to balance both names. You can call me Zephany or Mich\u00e9, it's fine.\"\n\nMich\u00e9's story is told in the book Zephany: Two mothers.
