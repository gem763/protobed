No one cuts weight like me \u2026 no one. So I can do it, to answer it. Really I have unfinished business.\u201d", "description": "Darren Till's next fight at UFC 244 is set for middleweight, but he's still \"got a few names at welterweight\" he wants to take out.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/darren-till-ufc-london-ceremonial-weigh-ins-02.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
