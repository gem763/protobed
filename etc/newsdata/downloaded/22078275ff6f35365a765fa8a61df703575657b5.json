Sometimes they end in harmony, recognizing that opposites attract (\u201cThe Odd Couple,\u201d \u201cThe Goodbye Girl\u201d) and fate brings compatible buffoons together (\u201cStep Brothers\u201d). Other times, the characters\u2019 discord results in homicide (\u201cSingle White Female\u201d), eviction (\u201cBridesmaids\u201d) and more casualties.\n\n\u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d teeters somewhere between those extremes. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe play lightkeepers bunking on a remote island off the coast of Maine in the 1890s, where they spend four weeks doing tiresome physical labor and safeguarding the titular edifice. The weather soon turns nasty. So does the tension. Every issue that arises when sharing a confined space \u2014 bottled-up emotions, chores, boredom, meals, hormones, flatulence \u2014 turns into a power struggle.\n\nBeneath that psychodrama lies an unspoken tenderness that is, in a word, homoerotic.\n\nEphraim Winslow (Pattinson) arrives as the apprentice to longtime lighthouse guardian Thomas Wake (Dafoe). Alone together in a mental tug of war, Ephraim becomes the submissive to Thomas\u2019 dominant. As much as they externalize hypermasculine paradigms, the loneliness of their isolation reveals a need for affection that was there all along.\n\nAt first, indignant Ephraim seems to display an Oedipal fixation on gruff Thomas, jealous of his boss\u2019s access to the lighthouse, which possesses a mystical allure, while he is relegated to menial tasks. But that envy gives way to something more erotic, fueled by phallic euphemisms and low-grade booze. The more these men suppress their cravings for companionship, the more intimacy and animosity meld. Ephraim and Thomas eventually find themselves dancing in the night and coming deliriously close to sharing a kiss.\n\nAnd yet \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d remains coy about the pair\u2019s exact desires. Shot in crisp black-and-white that accentuates its vintage setting, the movie is a dizzying whirlwind of ambiguities. Blending humor and suspense, director Robert Eggers unleashes the same quivering paranoia he brought to his sterling 2016 debut, \u201cThe Witch.\u201d What\u2019s real and what\u2019s imagined are indistinguishable under the hypnosis of the story.\n\nThis film originated with Eggers\u2019 brother, Max, who was working on a ghost-story screenplay revolving around a lighthouse. \u201cWhen he said \u2018ghost story in a lighthouse,\u2019 I pictured, basically, a dinner scene of the two of them in a rusty, dusty, crusty, musty atmosphere, black and white, 35 millimeter, boxy aspect ratio, facial hair, pipe smoke, cable-knit sweaters,\u201d Eggers recalled.\n\nFrom there, the siblings dived into period-specific research and collaborated on the script, always clear that Ephraim and Thomas\u2019 proclivities should be open to interpretation. The movie is more intriguing as a result, even if we\u2019re denied the joy of seeing Pattinson and Dafoe get it on.\n\nIn separate conversations with Eggers and his two lead actors, I probed them on the homoeroticism sprinkled throughout \u201cThe Lighthouse.\u201d Minor spoilers ahead, so proceed with caution, matey. Their answers have been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nA24 Willem Dafoe and Pattinson in \"The Lighthouse.\"\n\nThe Origins\n\nWhen you\u2019re watching \u201cThe Lighthouse,\u201d its queer undertones don\u2019t immediately reveal themselves. Were they something that Eggers, Pattinson and Dafoe consciously discussed?\n\nDafoe: It\u2019s there. What\u2019s to talk about? It\u2019s a no-brainer.\n\nEggers: The heart of it was always there. The whole thing is about power dynamics, so it is about Willem pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing. And there\u2019s pent-up anger and pent-up erotic energy and pent-up smells. Where is that breaking point? Also, how does alcohol play on all these dynamics?\n\nPattinson: It was pretty explicit in the script. The script said the lighthouse looked like an erect penis.\n\nWhat\u2019s Beneath Their Unspoken Desires\n\nWhen Ephraim and Thomas first appear in the same shot, they stand deadly still, staring into the camera with bitter glowers, daring us to come along for the ride that\u2019s to follow. On the first night in their shared cabin, Thomas makes it clear that he will lord over Ephraim. \u201cThe light is mine,\u201d Thomas declares, insisting that Ephraim stick to more laborious duties. Immediately, lines are drawn. Ephraim is in a position of servitude, exploited by Thomas' carnal attraction to the beacon. This only reinforces the mounting tension. Soon enough, Ephraim is dreaming about Thomas lying shirtless in that erect lighthouse.\n\nPattinson: Isn\u2019t it really a love story in a lot of ways, where they just don\u2019t know what to do with each other?\n\nEggers: Am I saying these characters are gay? No. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not either. Forget about complexities of human sexuality or their particular inclinations. I\u2019m more about questions than answers in this movie.\n\nDafoe: Toxic masculinity! They\u2019re pushing each other\u2019s buttons out of fear and out of threat of who they are. And they\u2019re both guilty. They have a sense of guilt, of wrong. There\u2019s no moral judgment in this story. It\u2019s just to watch these two guys struggling to find a way to survive themselves, really. The [philosopher Blaise] Pascal quote \u201cAll miseries of the world can be connected to the fact that a man can\u2019t sit alone in his room\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m paraphrasing \u2014 is basically it. It\u2019s a simple story, but it\u2019s got existential roots and identity things and things about masculinity and domination and submission. And for better and for worse. Then you see it flip-flop and it\u2019s kind of cool.\n\nPattinson: In so many ways, you\u2019re thinking how much of the relationship is actually happening. How much of it is in [Ephraim\u2019s] head? Willem\u2019s character could just be a normal boss, but there\u2019s some kind of sub/dom relationship or something where I\u2019m exaggerating in my mind his dominance over me because I kind of want it in a strange kind of way. It always read as a very sensual relationship. It wasn\u2019t just about a boss and his worker. Also, he\u2019s kind of mad, as well.\n\nEggers: For better or for worse, my brother and I are fairly Jungian-inclined. Obviously that [lighthouse] symbol is quite clear. And being Jungian-inclined, it inspires themes and motifs in the story. In a fucking incredibly juvenile way, we hammer it home with vaginal keyholes and phallic lumberjack tools and logs. It goes on and on and on. I hope it\u2019s a movie where both Jung and Freud would be furiously eating their popcorn.\n\nPattinson: I was pretty conscious of how I wanted the relationship to come across. In a lot of ways, he sort of wants a daddy.\n\nJoel C Ryan/Invision/Associated Press Robert Eggers, Dafoe and Pattinson at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2019.\n\nEuphemisms Aplenty\n\nIn the movie\u2019s most memorable scene, a frenzied Ephraim insists, \u201cIf I had a steak \u2015 oh boy, a rare, bloody steak \u2015 if I had a steak, I would fuck it.\u201d This offends Thomas, who has been preparing their dinners nightly, and he starts fishing for compliments. \u201cYou\u2019re fond of me lobster, ain\u2019t you?\u201d he asks in his pirate cadence. \u201cSay you\u2019re fond of me lobster.\u201d At the very least, it\u2019s a cry for affection. At most, Thomas is talking about his penis.\n\nEggers: I knew what I was writing, yes.\n\nDafoe: The slang in Naples for penis is \u201cfish.\u201d Yeah. It\u2019s all there. There are those tender moments. It\u2019s masculine archetypes in trouble, so those things that seem perfectly secure and Puritan \u2014 good, working men \u2014 unravel really quickly. I think that\u2019s also the source of a lot of the humor.\n\nPattinson: There\u2019s something about that kind of comedy through desperation. It\u2019s almost frightening, but it\u2019s sort of ridiculous at the same time.\n\nThe Near Kiss\n\nIn their dimly lit dining quarters, Ephraim and Thomas throw down liquor, swap biographies and goad each other. Through flirtations disguised as aggression, the men become better acquainted. Thomas calls Ephraim \u201cpretty as a picture\u201d and explains that he got divorced after being away from home so often. The cagey Ephraim says, without offering many specifics, that he\u2019s been fleeing one job after the next, haunted by some sort of mysterious past. As time wears on, the weather becomes stormy and their moods turbulent. But all the while, stuck indoors with nothing but each other, they\u2019re developing a kinship. When especially drunk one night, they dance a jig together and slow dance in each other\u2019s arms. Thomas sings a lullaby as Ephraim clings to his shirt, yearning for comfort. The men then peer at each other and glide in for a kiss, until pulling away and reacting with brief fisticuffs and more cuddling.\n\nPattinson: We had a teacher come, and we had a couple dancing lessons with her. But add on top of that the characters\u2019 turbocharged drinking, and it turns into a different thing.\n\nEggers: You see men dancing together in an old-timey setting. It\u2019s just something that happened. I mean, men dance together now in non-homosexual-inclined situations. But we knew that in this world, all they have is each other, and there are these peaks of highs and lows. So you have the fast dancing that I\u2019ve seen documentaries of lumberjack camps doing \u2014 that step-dancing-adjacent kind of stuff. But when you get drunk enough, you\u2019re going to be slow dancing.\n\nDafoe: When they\u2019re dancing, it\u2019s not so much that they have anything to do with each other, but they\u2019re both there and they\u2019re both warm. It\u2019s very clear. There\u2019s that moment where they almost kiss, but then it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, we can\u2019t!\u201d It\u2019s a no-brainer because it\u2019s a very melancholy sense of longing. They\u2019re holding each other and they\u2019re kind of sweet and they\u2019re drunk. Boys get together when they\u2019re drunk sometimes.\n\nEggers: Someone said to me that the fight they have after the botched kiss is more erotic than the dancing. I don\u2019t know if I agree, but I like the idea.\n\nPattinson: It all made sense to me, the psychology where you can only show that kind of emotion when you\u2019re completely wasted. But at the same time, in the early scenes, he\u2019s so desperately wanting to please. And then when he rebels against Willem, he wants to be punished just to get attention. He comes across as a guy who\u2019s probably had an incredibly hard life. He\u2019s been working manual labor and been this itinerant wanderer for ages. He\u2019s done some bad stuff and feels really guilty about it and basically wants some sort of comforting, but he doesn\u2019t know how to ask for it or how to talk about it. It all comes out in this manic, overly physical stuff.\n\nEggers: A lot of sea ballads are from the perspective of the wife or the fianc\u00e9e who\u2019s been left by the sailor, so there\u2019s many really incredible recordings of old men singing these songs about \u201cJohnny left me.\u201d It\u2019s really quite powerful. But it\u2019s also not like homosexuality didn\u2019t exist in the past. You don\u2019t need to wonder about these lumberjack shanty camps and stag lighthouse settings.\n\nA24 Dafoe and Pattinson in \"The Lighthouse.\"\n\n\u2018Waking Off In A Shed,\u2019 Or: About That Masturbation\n\nWe see Ephraim furiously masturbating at night, sometimes fondling a small mermaid figurine. But his fantasies about female sea spirits are intercut with images of a blond male lumberjack. After one orgasm ends in tears, it\u2019s clear that the mermaid-lumberjack combo makes him feel, well, something. Mythology and folklore sometimes link mermaids to sirens, creatures known for enchanting horny men. Maybe Ephraim is bisexual. Maybe the mermaid doll is a displacement of his lust for Thomas and the lumberjack. Maybe he\u2019s simply envious of Thomas. Maybe it\u2019s something else entirely.\n\nEggers: I certainly have an answer for you, but I\u2019m not going to say it. Sorry, respectfully.\n\nPattinson: That\u2019s one of the things I was building the whole character on. It felt very visceral. It\u2019s a paradigm of not having the mental mechanisms to deal with your feelings and your memories. There\u2019s something kind of OCD about the character. He\u2019s basically masturbating as if he were doing a drug. Some people are so torn apart and out of control with their desires and sexuality that it torments them. The mermaid statue is such an innocuous thing, but I think he\u2019s more tormenting himself about his desire. He\u2019s tied up in knots about such a simple thing. He\u2019s just so afraid of losing control of himself. There\u2019s also something about the little rain hat he has on his head. Like, you really have that hat while you\u2019re wanking off in a shed?\n\nEggers: Neither [my brother nor I] thought this was a good idea, but there was an early version [of the script] where it ended up with Robert Pattinson growing a full beard and putting on Willem Dafoe\u2019s outfit. It was just like, \u201cThis is stupid.\u201d Look, we make all these huge, gratuitous bad choices, and we really stick to them. That one was even too juvenile for us.\n\n\u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d is now in theaters.", "description": "Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe and director Robert Eggers break down the sensual undertones of their tense buddy movie.", "authors": ["Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da9cb65210000ad15ad335f.jpeg?cache=ikk5zhcsmy&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
