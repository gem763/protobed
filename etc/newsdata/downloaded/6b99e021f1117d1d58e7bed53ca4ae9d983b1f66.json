Will Hurt Him on Iran", "language": "en", "text": "Richard Gowan is U.N. director for the International Crisis Group, which recently published \"Seven Opportunities for the UN in 2019-2020.\"\n\nWhenever Donald Trump visits the United Nations, Turtle Bay braces for a diplomatic explosion. In 2017, he upset other leaders at the U.N. General Assembly by threatening to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea. The president was not quite as threatening last year, even though he faced a minor humiliation when foreign politicians and diplomats laughed derisively at his claim to have \u201cachieved more than almost any administration in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nBut his third address to the U.N., coming Tuesday, could be especially incendiary. Iran will be his target this time. The current Persian Gulf crisis is one of the most severe international tests Trump has faced. If he uses the same bellicose rhetoric toward Tehran over the recent attack on Saudi oil installations that he did when he mocked Kim Jong Un as \u201cRocket Man,\u201d he will receive a very icy response from much of his U.N. audience.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSince Trump came to power, he has systematically disrespected the U.N., promoting advisers that disdain the organization while pulling out of a litany of multilateral treaties and institutions. At every opportunity, he has emphasized that national sovereignty rather than international cooperation is his highest priority. Over the past year in particular, Washington has aimed to marginalize the U.N.\u2019s role in crises from Libya to Venezuela, alienating even close allies along the way. Now, all that could backfire on him at a moment when he might well need key partners such as Britain, France and Germany if he hopes to avoid military conflict in the Gulf.\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N.

It has largely failed. When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited the Security Council to criticize Tehran in August, other diplomats repeated that a nuclear deal is still key to regional stability. While the U.S. used a closed-door Security Council meeting last week to accuse Iran of orchestrating the latest attacks on Saudi Arabia, everyone else concentrated on the need for restraint.\n\nAlthough the Security Council\u2019s skepticism toward the U.S. reflects other states\u2019 fears of a new regional conflict in the Middle East, it is also indicative of the administration\u2019s broader loss of credibility in Turtle Bay.\n\nBack in 2017, many leaders hoped that Trump would come to appreciate the value of multilateral cooperation. For all the president\u2019s invective, Washington dealt with the North Korean nuclear crisis by negotiating new U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang with the Chinese.\n\nYet in the wake of that initial multilateral success, Trump has treated the U.N. with growing disdain. In choosing John Bolton as national security adviser and Pompeo as secretary of State in 2018, he turned to two instinctive U.N.-skeptics to lead on foreign policy. Bolton\u2019s dislike for the institution was already legendary. Pompeo, although perhaps less obsessive on the topic, reportedly views U.N. negotiations and resolutions as mainly useless.\n\nBolton and Pompeo\u2019s appointments reduced the influence of Trump\u2019s first ambassador in New York, Nikki Haley, who took much of the credit for the Korean talks. After Haley chose to exit the administration at the end of last year, Washington failed to send a full-time permanent representative to New York for almost nine months (the second-longest such interregnum since 1945). In the interim, U.S. diplomats in New York often struggled to get clear instructions from Washington on even routine negotiations.\n\nOn some crises, the U.S. has deliberately blocked U.N. action. Washington has made it clear to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that it does not want the organization mediating in Venezuela. It has also stopped the Security Council from making more than token statements on the intensifying war in Libya, apparently because some administration members, including Bolton, wanted to give Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar\u2014a strongman opposed to the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli\u2014a chance to score a military victory.\n\nThrough this mix of inattention and obstructionism, Trump\u2019s team has starved the U.N. of opportunities to affect many crises. In this, it is arguably even more negative toward the institution than the George W. Bush administration, which ignored the Security Council over Iraq, but was keen for U.N. peacekeepers to stabilize trouble spots such as Haiti and Liberia.\n\nMany commentators see Trump\u2019s decision to select a relative diplomatic novice, Kelly Knight Craft, as Haley\u2019s successor as further evidence of his desire to downgrade U.N. affairs. Craft is a Republican donor with a couple of years of experience as ambassador to Canada, although she was absent from Ottawa for long periods. Unlike Haley, she is not a member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, presumably because the president and Pompeo do not want another overpowerful representative in New York. Ambassadors from U.S. allies in New York say that they hope to build a collegial relationship with Craft, as they did with Haley, and note that she has a reputation for personal decency. But few expect her to be a decisive voice in Washington policy debates.\n\nYet if Trump\u2019s policies and personnel decisions seem calculated to let the U.N. drift into irrelevance, they also have the potential to curb U.S. influence. The rest of the U.N. membership seem increasingly inclined to get on with multilateral diplomacy with or without American input. The main focus for this year\u2019s General Assembly session is a summit on speeding up implementation of the Paris climate change pact, which Trump will miss. China, one of the countries that has led preparatory work on the climate meeting, is increasingly assertive in U.N. debates, and is insisting on filling a growing number of top multilateral jobs.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the U.S. is increasingly poorly placed to sell its positions to other powers in New York. The president has taken some measures that might help alleviate this situation in recent weeks. Although he almost certainly wasn\u2019t motivated by a desire to curry favor with the U.N. crowd, Trump\u2019s decision to fire Bolton this month, coupled with signals that he would be willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in New York, came as welcome news to much of the audience he will be facing at the General Assembly.\n\nTrying to build positive momentum for the U.S. at Turtle Bay would be sensible if, as political observers concluded after Bolton\u2019s exit, Trump wants to reposition himself as a global \u201cdeal-maker\u201d before next year\u2019s elections. While the president likes personal diplomacy, he still needs the U.N. For all his talk of a \u201cbeautiful\u201d relationship with Kim Jong Un, for example, the U.S. is relying on U.N. sanctions as a key source of leverage over Pyongyang. And if Trump were to succeed in his on-again-off-again pursuit of a deal with the Taliban to allow U.S. troops to exit Afghanistan, the U.N. could end up managing talks on a post-American government in Kabul.\n\nFor now, any aspirations Trump may have to be a peacemaker-in-chief are subordinate to the need to deal with the Gulf crisis. If the president tries to rally other leaders against Iran at the General Assembly, he is unlikely to convince any governments that aren\u2019t already in the U.S. camp. Having squandered other powers\u2019 trust and goodwill at the U.N., the U.S. can expect few favors from them now. Getting Security Council backing for any kind of coercive measures or even condemnation of Iran is simply a nonstarter. In contrast to the 2017 Korean crisis, China and Russia show no inclination to compromise with the U.S. over Iran.\n\nWhile Washington\u2019s European partners on the Council may condemn Tehran if the U.S. decisively proves it was behind the Saudi Aramco attacks, they will get jittery if military action seems in the cards. Even loyal NATO members like the Netherlands and Nordic countries have ducked Washington\u2019s requests to participate in U.S.-led naval patrols in the Gulf, although Australia and the United Kingdom are on board. An actual attack on Iran would find even fewer backers.\n\nIf the U.S. does eventually pursue significant military action in the Gulf, it will draw comparisons with the invasion of Iraq. But in the Iraq case, even the countries that most strongly opposed the U.S. invasion in the Security Council felt that it was necessary to rebuild relations at the U.N. rapidly afterward. There was little doubt that the U.S. was the indispensable power in New York. Today, it has lost some of that luster as China bids for a leadership role in multilateral diplomacy while the U.S. distances itself from many international processes. The U.S. might find it harder to rebuild bridges at the U.N. after an attack on Iran than in the post-Iraq period.\n\nIf, though, Trump wants to make peace with Iran and avoid a military confrontation, he will find that difficult without allies at the U.N. France has already tabled proposals for Tehran and Washington to reduce tensions, involving sanctions relief for the Iranians in return for new commitments by them to honor the existing nuclear bargain, and stop regional provocations. The best way out of the current crisis for Trump would be to agree to such a compromise and ask the Security Council to work together on monitoring Tehran\u2019s compliance.\n\nThe U.S. could also throw its weight behind the U.N.\u2019s flagging efforts to mediate peace in Yemen, which could improve the overall security picture in the Middle East. But to make progress on either front, Trump will need to convince other leaders he is willing to work toward stabilizing the Middle East in good faith. Right now, they have reasons to be skeptical about that.\n\nAs Trump prepares to speak to the General Assembly, therefore, his administration\u2019s twin policies of confronting Iran and shunning the U.N. have converged to put him in a weak diplomatic position in front of other global leaders. Now would be a good time to reconsider both.\n\n", "description": "His long campaign to undermine its influence will leave U.S. without key partners to resolve the latest crisis.", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "Richard Gowan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/44/9b/e17db7604fdbb44b3b576ec292a5/mag-gowan-un-trump-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
