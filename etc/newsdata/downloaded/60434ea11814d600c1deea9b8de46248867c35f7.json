Search operations are underway for the three people still missing.\n\n\"The gorge in Hell's Gate National Park has been closed to the public with immediate effect due to continuing rains,\" KWS said Sunday.\n\nIt added that a helicopter was being dispatched from the capital Nairobi, which is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the park, to help with search efforts.\n\nHell's Gate is a popular hiking and cycling spot for tourists and locals and is known for its towering cliffs and gorges carved by a prehistoric lake.\n\nThe park's scenery inspired the 1994 Disney animation \"The Lion King,\" and the 2003 film \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider -- The Cradle of Life\" was shot on location there.", "description": "Four people have died and two others are missing after a tour group was swept away by flash flooding in a national park in Kenya.", "authors": ["Helen Regan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190901220444-hells-gate-national-park-restricted-super-tease.jpg"}
