Few young people nursing political dreams say: \u201cWhen I grow up, I want to be a foul-mouthed, overreaching, anti-religious culmination of every exaggerated liberal stereotype and the embodiment of every fevered conservative nightmare.\u201d Perhaps O\u2019Rourke was just precocious in that way. It is more likely, however, that he was led in this direction by the increasingly desperate pursuit of a spotlight that fell on him once, and briefly.\n\nSome responsible Democrat needs to sit O\u2019Rourke down and tell him it is not worth winning the Democratic nomination in ways that guarantee a reelection landslide for President Trump. And that it is not worth losing the Democratic nomination in ways that badly hurt the eventual Democratic nominee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe loyalty and enthusiasm of Trump\u2019s base of support in the GOP \u2014 especially among white evangelicals \u2014 are ensured by apocalyptic fears. The election of a Democratic president, the story goes, would end America as we know it and usher in an era of anti-Christian persecution. By this logic, conservative Christians view Trump as a thug who fights in their favor.\n\nIt is a unique conception of religious social engagement: Hire someone to do unto others what you fear they will do to you. This is Christian politics as protection racket. It is theologically inadequate \u2014 and damaging to the public standing and witness of evangelicals. But it makes more sense as a political strategy when the threat from secular liberalism becomes less imaginary.\n\nAsked in a CNN town hall whether churches and religious organizations should lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage, O\u2019Rourke responded: \u201cYes. There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us. And so, as president, we\u2019re going to make that a priority and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhere to begin? Was O\u2019Rourke really promising to withdraw tax benefits from people \u2014 \u201canyone\u201d \u2014 who do not approve of same-sex marriage and not just institutions? Would someone who is internally divided get a partial tax break? What if they changed their mind during the third quarter of the fiscal year?\n\nPresumably, this was O\u2019Rourke getting carried away in his disdain for religiously conservative Christians and Muslims. But the problem gets no easier in applying the O\u2019Rourke rule to institutions and organizations. How does one decide if, say, one United Methodist church is in violation of the new IRS rule and another is not? By the minister\u2019s view on same-sex marriage? By counting the majority position of the congregation? By the view of the local bishop? By the view of the national church? Or the international communion?\n\nThe taxation of churches according to their moral views would be inherently and massively intrusive. In the majority opinion of Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, Chief Justice Warren Burger argued that any taxation of churches would mandate extensive interaction between government and religion. \u201cThe exemption creates only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, and far less than taxation of churches,\u201d he said. \u201cIt restricts the fiscal relationship between church and state, and tends to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating each from the other.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe proposed O\u2019Rourke rule would only really work by getting rid of the tax \u201creward\u201d for all religious institutions \u2014 institutions that some progressives seem to view with thinly concealed contempt. But the exemption is not really a reward. Through it, according to Burger, the tax code \u201csimply abstains from demanding that the church support the state.\u201d And, as a practical matter, changing this treatment would cripple the provision of social services to the poor and suffering, since religious institutions feed the hungry, treat substance abuse, resettle refugees, provide health care, housing, legal services, mentoring, literacy education and employment training, and make countless other humane contributions to the common good.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal is manifestly foolish \u2014 an example of ideology unleashed by ignorance. The eventual nominee of the party \u2014 who will not be O\u2019Rourke \u2014 will either repudiate this idea or grant Trump a stout stick to beat Democrats with.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The eventual Democratic nominee \u2014 who won\u2019t be O\u2019Rourke \u2014 needs to repudiate this foolish idea.", "authors": ["Michael Gerson"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gOB82r7T7R0ZT40OQqWx8oTNzE0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C5ICY4HOWMI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
