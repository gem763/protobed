Liverpool and Arsenal traded 10 goals that ranged from ugly to stunning and everything in between. They traded mistakes, terrible ones, and they traded blows from beginning to the very end. Only one penalty in a shootout separated them and, when an enthralling cup tie was all over, it was Liverpool celebrating a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nLiverpool 5-5 Arsenal (5-4 pens): Carabao Cup fourth round \u2013 live reaction! Read more\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher \u2013 Klopp\u2019s third choice, 20-year-old goalkeeper \u2013 made the decisive save in an otherwise perfect shootout from Dani Ceballos as Arsenal paid the price for failing to defend a 3-1 lead, a 4-2 lead and a 5-4 lead in the dying seconds. Liverpool\u2019s other telling contribution came from Divock Origi, who converted an injury\u2011time volley as a host of Arsenal defenders stood watching to spare the home side a first Anfield defeat in 13 months and send the tie to penalties. Curtis Jones converted Liverpool\u2019s fifth and final penalty to punish Ceballos\u2019s failure from 12 yards.\n\nBoth managers made 11 changes to their starting lineups from the weekend while claiming they were treating the competition with the utmost respect. Emery\u2019s selection was more experienced and he took out the insurance policy of a substitutes\u2019 bench packed with first-choice talent. Klopp did not even go that far. A midfield of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana and Naby Ke\u00efta offered maturity, so too captain James Milner at left-back but the Liverpool team \u2013 and bench \u2013 was otherwise packed with young talent. The teenage summer signings Harvey Elliott and Sepp van den Berg were among five Anfield debutants while the 18-year-old right-back Neco Williams made his full Liverpool debut in a starting lineup with an average age of 23 years and 122 days. There was no sign of nerves in a confident start from the home side before it was undermined by a combination of carelessness and inexperience.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Caoimhin Kelleher dives to his right to deny Arsenal\u2019s Dani Ceballos in the penalty shootout.

Williams, a Wales under-19 international, released the midfielder behind Sead Kolasinac and Oxlade-Chamberlain delivered a first-time cross towards Rhian Brewster at the near post. Shkodran Mustafi diverted it past his own goalkeeper with his left knee. A dreadful return to the side for the Germany World Cup winner, and he almost made matters worse moments later with an under-cooked back pass to Emiliano Mart\u00ednez that forced the keeper to take evasive action as Brewster closed in.\n\nRashford rocket stuns Chelsea and extends Manchester United\u2019s resurgence Read more\n\nArsenal, with Mesut \u00d6zil back in from the cold, drew level from their first meaningful attack. Martinelli instigated the equaliser with a powerful surge down the left and low cross that Lucas Torreira and \u00d6zil were unable to convert. \u00d6zil kept the pressure on, however, Bukayo Saka\u2019s shot was saved low by Caoimhin Kelleher but Torreira snapped up the rebound from close range. VAR would have disallowed it for offside.\n\nThe visitors overturned the deficit when Torreira released Ainsley Maitland-Niles down the right and, from his second attempted cross, Van Den Berg miscued towards his own goal. Kelleher saved but Martinelli was on hand to convert into the roof of the net.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nArsenal were clinical with their chances. Liverpool fell further behind when over-elaborating out of defence. Elliott turned a Williams pass carelessly inside to \u00d6zil, who released Saka clear down the left with a fine first touch. The cross arrived low and perfectly for Martinelli to score his seventh goal in seven appearances with an emphatic shot over the exposed Kelleher. Emery\u2019s team sensed daylight and welcome respite but the fun was only just beginning.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s wayward passing and uncertain defending tested Anfield\u2019s patience but they were offered a route back minutes before the interval when Elliott tumbled over Martinelli\u2019s out-stretched foot inside the penalty area. Andre Marriner had no hesitation in pointing to the spot, seconds after dismissing a penalty appeal for handball by H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, and Milner duly sent Mart\u00ednez the wrong way.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mesut \u00d6zil flicks the ball back to Ainsley Maitland-Niles to give Arsenal a 4-2 lead.

The winger\u2019s first touch took the ball away from Kelleher and the goal but the quick-thinking \u00d6zil kept play alive with an improvised flick. Maitland-Niles tapped into an empty net and Liverpool had it all to do once again. The comeback recommenced with a thumping 25-yard strike from Oxlade-Chamberlain, who found the top corner having beaten Maitland-Niles to a Lallana header. It restored parity when Curtis Jones, a replacement for the subdued Ke\u00efta, found Origi on the edge of the Arsenal area and the striker turned Rob Holding brilliantly before beating Mart\u00ednez with a thunderous shot.\n\nAnd back came Arsenal. The tie was ridiculously open and so too was Liverpool\u2019s midfield when Willock breezed through minimal resistance before unleashing a shot from almost 30 yards that sailed away from Kelleher and dipped into the top corner.", "description": "Arsenal were 5-4 up before Liverpool\u2019s Divock Origi made it 5-5 in the fourth minute of stoppage time and Curtis Jones then scored the winning penalty", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c747dc784ef86901d5faf783904a4b25f26b42c/578_70_2884_1731/master/2884.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26a1289e25df9a5ade5cbe907fb78923", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
