No other country comes close. So yes, this is f***** up. If we don\u2019t call it out for what it is, don't speak clearly, we will continue to have this bloodshed in America and I cannot accept that,\u201d he said. The presidential candidate added that \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d have done nothing to curb the widespread mass shootings and gun violence in America.\n\nFellow Democratic presidential hopeful, former HUD Secretary and Texas-native Juli\u00e1n Castro outright questioned the sale of military-grade weaponry, claiming even the biggest second amendment supporters fail to see the necessity of such guns during an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday.\n\n\"Often times it's actually hunters and folks that shoot on a range that understand that you don't need these weapons of war, the AR-15 and other similar weapons. I think more and more, many of them get it,\" Castro said.\n\nActing United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan said the ongoing mass gun violence is \"absolutely a homeland security threat,\" telling ABC's \"This Week\" that it\u2019s \u201ca priority for us that we set up new office including racially motivated violent extremism.\u201d\n\nMcAleenan noted it was extraordinarily concerning that so many people were killed and injured in Saturday\u2019s mass shooting, which began with a traffic stop in Midland, Texas just some 300 miles from El Paso, where 22 people were killed and another 24 injured at a Walmart on Aug. 3.\n\nHe noted that the Department of Homeland Security is working with several other federal agencies to make domestic terrorism as much as a focus resource-wise as international terrorist threats.\n\n\"That's a conversation we're having as an interagency team with the FBI, with the Office of Management and Budget, to see what the right resource level is going forward, to make sure we can continue our very strong focus on the international terrorism threat and prevention level we've achieved but also make sure we're balancing that out with effective efforts on domestic terrorism as well,\" McAleenan added.\n\nMidland Police Chief Michael Gerke revealed that the victims who died in Saturday\u2019s shooting ranged in age from 15 to 57 at a news conference Sunday, while the 22 wounded included a 17-month old child, who is expected to survive.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "After seven people died and nearly two dozen others were injured by an armed driver in Odessa, Texas, the president and other policymakers vowed to work on a solution to gun violence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP19244534227358.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
