And make no mistake, our scientific communities [have] already spoken. The facts are clear. Unless you live in an alternate reality, there\u2019s no more time for denial,\u201d Mr. DiCaprio continued.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly questioned the severity of climate change and said once that it was a Chinese \u201choax.\u201d\n\nMr. DiCaprio took the time to applaud children in climate activism such as Greta Thunberg.\n\n\u201cThese young people have said clearly, definitively, and without fear that the time for inaction is now over. Yet surprisingly, some have reacted to this movement with insulting tweets and negative talking points \u2014 individuals that seem to care more about profit and their own self-interests than about your future,\u201d Mr. DiCaprio said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
