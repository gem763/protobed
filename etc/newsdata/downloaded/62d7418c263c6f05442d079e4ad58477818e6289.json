Heads of institutions are allowed to accept the risk of someone who has been flagged by the SSA being in their employ\".\n\nThe response unsettled all and sundry, with Mente asking who would be held accountable for the end result in the example she had presented.\n\n\"That man is in a public space, dealing with people's personal information and goods,\" she said.\n\n'Part and parcel of those in dock'\n\nDlodlo said an overhaul of some of the present regulations in dealing with vetting procedures was needed, adding she had tried to do this since her term began.\n\n\"We need to take away the discretion part of the regulation.\"\n\nScopa chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said heads of institutions who take on the risk that ends in tragedy, such as the Mrwetyana case, \"should be part and parcel of those in the dock and that the regulations should look into enforcing that\".\n\n\"You cannot assume risk and then not be held accountable for what happens afterwards,\" he added.\n\nThe agency has set down September 2020 for the review of the minimum information standards and the fast-tracking of the approval vetting regulations.", "description": "State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo says an overhaul of some of the regulations in dealing with vetting procedures need an overhaul, adding she had tried to do this since her term began.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7926/1ef0caabe9a644468196c19e2c2571de.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
