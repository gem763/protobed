They included the shocking mistreatment of migrant children, which the morally attentive Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) \u2014 to his everlasting credit \u2014 continued calling to public attention up to his death.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump, of course, was no mere academic bystander as his theorem was put under heavy stress. He rallied his loyalists in primaries to purge Republicans who dared speak against him. Most in the GOP don\u2019t want to suffer the fate of former South Carolina representative Mark Sanford, whose 2018 primary defeat was an object lesson to other would-be dissenters. Trump has always understood Voltaire\u2019s sardonic observation that it\u2019s wise to mete out severe punishment to those who fail you \u201cto encourage the others.\u201d\n\nBut those others \u2014 meaning members of the Republican Party, who will be the arbiters of Trump\u2019s fate in the coming weeks \u2014 are not feeling quite as encouraged in their loyalty to the president as they once were.\n\nNo, Trump has not murdered anyone on Fifth Avenue yet. But many in his multiplying legion of critics believe the president has blood on his hands because of his weak and reckless response to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The result was Turkey\u2019s assault on the United States\u2019 Kurdish allies in Syria. For once, the president brought our deeply divided parties together. In the House, 129 Republicans joined every Democrat in condemning his fecklessness. Only 60 Republicans stuck with him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen came the admission from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, that the White House withheld nearly $400 million in military aid from Ukraine to further Trump\u2019s political objectives. Mulvaney tried to unscramble the unsavory omelet he had placed on Trump\u2019s desk \u2014 as The Post\u2019s editorialists archly observed, it seemed to dawn on Mulvaney that \u201cconfession might not be the most astute defense strategy\u201d \u2014 but his walk-back was entirely unconvincing.\n\nAnd Trump, the researcher, briefly tried to make the test of his loyalists as difficult as possible. As if his other breaches were not enough, the White House announced that the Group of Seven meeting of leading powers would be held at the ailing Trump National Doral resort near Miami. Realizing, for once, that he had gone too far, he backed off on Saturday.\n\nBut Mulvaney continued to perfect the art of the preemptive confession, a novel approach to damage control. Long after Trump claimed to have severed all operational ties to his enterprises, Mulvaney insisted on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the president \u201cconsiders himself to be in the hospitality business. ... He\u2019s in the hotel business.\u201d Perhaps realizing what he had just acknowledged, the acting chief of staff quickly added: \u201cAt least he was.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo how can the Fifth Avenue theory survive? Trump has one reliable gambit, the stick-it-to-the-libs strategy. Everything Trump does \u2014 his performative racism, his attacks on \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d his claims to be shielding conservative Christians from liberal persecution, his standing up to the dark hordes at our borders \u2014 is designed to turn all criticism of himself into a socialist-liberal-radical conspiracy against the good people who support him. As long as Trump is at the helm, they have nothing to fear.\n\nIt was convenient for Attorney General and chief Trump propagandist William \u00adP. Barr to issue a warning recently at the University of Notre Dame against \u201cmilitant secularists\u201d and \u201cso-called progressives\u201d for plotting the \u201corganized destruction\u201d of the role of religion in American public life.\n\n\u201cSecularists and their allies among the progressives,\u201d Barr thundered, \u201chave marshaled all the forces of mass communication, popular culture, the entertainment industry and academia in an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStanding with Trump means standing against those (particularly in mass communication and academia) whose jobs happen to entail presenting facts to counter the fictions of the president and his guardians.\n\nOh, yes, and for more conventional conservatives, there are those wonderful judges and Trump\u2019s economic policies. Conservatives don\u2019t want to give aid and comfort to the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, do they?\n\n\u201cMy enemies are your enemies\u201d is standard stuff among beleaguered politicians. But it can be a dangerous doctrine for those being asked to pledge loyalty. Trump is telling conservatives to forget pretty much everything they claim to stand for in the interest of grinding their boots into liberal faces. It\u2019s a lot to ask. But, hey, it\u2019s worked so far.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Everything Trump does is designed to turn all criticism of himself into a socialist-liberal-radical conspiracy.", "authors": ["E.J.
