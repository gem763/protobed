PE firms have been raising massive funds and have amassed hundreds of billions of dollars in so-called dry powder that has yet to be deployed into investments.\n\nHedge-fund performance, meanwhile, has also been under scrutiny, thanks to the high fees that are typical of the space. Last year, the average hedge fund lost money, and the market has outpaced the average fund in 2019, according to Hedge Fund Research.\n\nAnd the line between private equity and hedge funds has been getting more blurred. Some of Cooperman's hedge-fund brethren have been increasingly creeping into the private-equity space, with firms like Viking, Tiger Global, and Point72 investing in private markets and fighting PE firms for talent.\n\nLarge institutional investors, hedge funds' biggest clients, have also been pumping money into private equity, which has raised close to $432 billion in assets in 2018, with a large chunk of money that still hasn't been put to work.\n\nCooperman, who made his money as a value investor in the public stock market, said he believes the market is \"fully valued,\" making any deal expensive.\n\nHe noted that many deals being executed today have low interest rates for borrowing money \u2014 something he doesn't expect to be the case when private equity needs to sell out of their investments in seven to 10 years \u2014 and the fact the game is more crowded now.\n\n\"It's no longer an undiscovered concept,\" he said.\n\nRead more: The booming private market has some hedge funds spreading into private equity's domain. Now a tug-of-war has broken out over talent.\n\nAccording to Cooperman, who is transitioning his hedge fund into a family office, private-equity returns have been \"aided and abetted\" by the low-interest-rate environment that has followed the housing crisis. Without rates this low, he said, private equity returns would not be the same.\n\nLow interest rates have \"made the exit multiple much higher than the entrance multiple,\" he said, especially for large deals.\n\nWhen a member of the audience, who said they worked at a private-equity firm, pushed back on Cooperman's outlook, he said that some smaller deals could still make sense, but the current projection for interest rates does not make large-scale deals a good bet. Many of those big deals, he said, ultimately enrich executives at the firm.\n\n\"I think leveraged buyouts to a degree are a giant case of insider trading,\" he said, referencing examples of public companies that then become private.\n\nRead more: We talked to 7 insiders about the $27 billion Refinitiv-LSE deal.
