(AP) - Jim Boeheim is set for his 44th season at Syracuse, and this time around the Orange got a jump start with a summer trip to Italy.\n\nWith five freshmen on board and lots of scoring to replace, that\u2019s a plus.\n\n\u201cEverybody on the trip contributed and looked comfortable in what we were trying to do. We\u2019re a little further ahead,\u201d Boeheim said Friday at the team\u2019s annual media day. \u201cFrom that point of view, it was very helpful. But basically you still go back and do the same things that you would do every year. We\u2019re a little further ahead. There\u2019s personnel coming back, but there\u2019s so many new guys you do a lot of teaching stuff that is new to them.\u201d\n\nAmong those returning are forwards Elijah Hughes, Marek Dolezaj, Robert Braswell, and Bourama Sidibe, and guards Howard Washington, Buddy Boeheim - the coach\u2019s youngest son - and Jalen Carey. Gone is a trio - Tyus Battle, Oshae Brissett and Frank Howard - that played big minutes and accounted for 55 percent of the scoring on a team that averaged 69.7 points a game last season, as well as towering center Paschal Chukwu, who had 57 blocks.\n\n\u201cThe difference with this year\u2019s team and last year\u2019s with Tyus, Frank, and Oshae you basically had three guys that were going to play 38 minutes,\u201d Boeheim said. \u201cAnd this year the only guy at this stage that looks like he would be playing that many minutes would be Elijah. I think there\u2019s more flexibility in terms of the minutes.\u201d\n\nHughes was second on the team in scoring last season at 13.7 points per game and led with 87 3-pointers, and he\u2019ll be looked at to be one of the leaders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what you come to Syracuse for. You want to be a leader. You want to be that guy that people look at to make plays,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nNewcomers include forward Quincy Guerrier, centers John Bol Ajak and Jesse Edwards, and guards Joseph Girard III, New York state\u2019s all-time leading scorer, and Brycen Goodine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty flexible where guys are going to play,\u201d Boeheim said. \u201cWe have five guards and four can play the point. We\u2019ll see how it goes. It\u2019s a work in progress. We\u2019re trying to figure out who\u2019s going to play. There\u2019s nothing set in stone. We\u2019ll be flexible with how we play guys. It could change, literally, from game to game. We\u2019ll see how people play.\u201d\n\nLast year the Orange had the nation\u2019s tallest team - topped by the 7-foot-2 Chukwu - but Boeheim\u2019s defensive scheme faltered in the postseason, allowing Baylor to hit 16 3-pointers in a 78-68 first-round victory over Syracuse in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nSyracuse, which went 20-14 last season, was picked to finish eighth in the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2019-20, behind Notre Dame and just ahead of Miami. Duke, North Carolina, Louisville, reigning national champion Virginia and Florida State were the top five. No Syracuse player was picked for the All-ACC team.\n\nThis season marks the ACC\u2019s first 20-game conference slate, including seven league games to begin the regular season. Doubleheaders are scheduled for Nov. 5-6 on the ACC Network, with Virginia visiting Syracuse on Nov. 6 in the Orange\u2019s season opener after a pair of late-October exhibitions.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a tough conference,\u201d Boeheim said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for everybody. You\u2019re starting new. It\u2019s new challenges every year. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nFor Girard, also a star quarterback in high school, it was a surreal moment as he contemplated playing in the Orange\u2019s scrimmage Friday night in the Carrier Dome as a member of the basketball team he rooted for as a kid back home in Glens Falls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Girard said. \u201cI played football games in the dome before. To think that I\u2019m going to be here playing basketball repping Syracuse this year is really different. You\u2019ve kind of got to pinch yourself - is this really happening?\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jim Boeheim is set for his 44th season at Syracuse, and this time around the Orange got a jump start with a summer trip to Italy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Kekis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/acc_media_day_basketball_03981_c0-228-5472-3420_s1200x700.jpg?f89739662670662341638fe34403095f75f3e118", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
