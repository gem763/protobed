With natural and human-induced calamities happening all over the world, I asked Andr\u00e9s how he decides where to help. \u201cWe try to go where we think is the biggest, most massive kind of hit by a natural event or a political event,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe go and we try just to feed the people as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nBecause of Andr\u00e9s\u2019s work in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017, he was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize the following year. He demurred when I asked him about that. But he was more talkative and direct about his food-centric philosophy of disaster response.\n\nIf you\u2019re hungry and you\u2019re thirsty, do you have a lot of patience? When you come to my restaurant and 30 minutes later, I didn\u2019t send you the first tapa, [and you] just start bitching on Yelp or . . . rightfully so. Imagine the same situation, a day, two days, three days later that you don\u2019t have food and you don\u2019t have water. So food is a very good example of the urgency of now. If it\u2019s [an] emergency and you\u2019re supposed to take care of your fellow citizens, fellow Americans, if you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re hungry today. Your children are hungry today. The elderly are hungry today. The very young kids are hungry today. Any day that passes is one day too late. So, this is a very simple thing to understand in emergencies. The urgency of now is now.\n\nThis gets to Andr\u00e9s\u2019s overall view of how disaster response would work. \u201cIn emergencies, locals know best how to take care of their own,\u201d Andr\u00e9s said as he decried the tendency of government personnel to tell locals \u201chow you should run your lives\u201d when they enter disaster zones. \u201cWe need to achieve a better moment where those organizations come in to help people in America or around the world, listen to the locals more and bring them into the solution.\u201d\n\nListen to the podcast to hear Andr\u00e9s talk more about how he got into the restaurant business, how Washington nurtured his drive to do good and give back, and why he doesn\u2019t issue plans when responding to a disaster.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf we plan too much, chances are that things are gonna be completely wrong. And once you have a plan, and everybody agrees on the plan, if the plan goes out of line, people freeze,\u201d Andr\u00e9s admitted. \u201cAdapting always in these scenarios is gonna be more important than planning.\u201d\n\nAnd what does a hot meal mean to the people who get them at their most vulnerable? Andr\u00e9s simply replied, \u201cHope.\u201d\n\n\u201cCape Up\u201d is Jonathan\u2019s weekly podcast talking to key figures behind the news and our culture.
