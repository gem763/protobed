The median North American stock trades 4% below our fair value estimate versus a 5% discount near the end of the first quarter. Meanwhile, the share of 4- or 5-star stocks marginally exceeds those rated 1 or 2 stars: 30% versus 25%. The global picture is similar, with the median stock at a 4% discount and the share of \"buys\" exceeding that of \"sells\" 32% versus 26%.\n\nEnergy continues to rank as the most compelling sector from a valuation perspective, with oil prices ending the quarter roughly where they began. We see particular opportunity in oilfield-services stocks.\n\nWe see a relatively large share of buying opportunities in the consumer cyclical sector. The auto, travel and leisure, and entertainment industries trade at the most attractive valuations.\n\nThe utilities sector looks overbought as investors clamor for yield. The median utility trades at a 12% premium to our fair value estimate, and the sector is home to only three stocks we rate 4 or 5 stars.", "description": "The energy sector is the most attractive from a valuation perspective, particularly oil-services stocks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltf44322e0cccafb93/5c76b9d6f6d704c65fb2bfcc/DanielRohr_1x1.jpg"}
