The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake,\u201d Haley tweeted.\n\nShe added a hashtag: \u201c#TurkeyIsNotOurFriend.\u201d\n\nWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend \u2014 Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) October 7, 2019\n\nHaley was not alone in criticizing Trump\u2019s decision \u2014 which the president has hinted at for years \u2014 but her criticism was notable for two reasons.\n\nOne was Haley\u2019s dismissal of the U.S. relationship with Turkey, a key NATO ally. The foreign policy establishment has long criticized Trump for criticizing NATO and the delinquent defense spending of many of its members.\n\nThe other notable fact about Haley\u2019s criticism was that the day before, Haley had defended Trump\u2019s foreign policy record:\n\nIf you look around the world, President Trump has a record every American should be proud of. In the Middle East, the ISIS caliphate has been destroyed, and we\u2019ve stopped handing billions in cash to Iran that it used to fund terrorism. The North Korean regime is no longer testing long-range missiles. America is once again treating the Cuban dictatorship like the pariah it is, and Maduro\u2019s days are numbered in Venezuela.\n\nShe added: \u201cAmerica is strong again, and it\u2019s because of President Trump\u2019s decisions.\u201d\n\nJoel B.
