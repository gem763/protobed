The DNC didn\u2019t go for that for whatever reason. And so we thought: 'Why don't make it happen?'\"\n\nHe continued: \"Look, I\u2019m biased. I think we could do a town hall a day on this and it wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover it because it\u2019s everything. It\u2019s everything in our lives, from energy to politics to geopolitics to psychology to history.\"\n\nClimate change has become a key issue in the 2020 presidential cycle as Democratic candidates have issued dire warnings about its impact and pushed massive policy proposals for dealing with the issue.\n\n\"The Democrats\u2019 destructive 'environmental' proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump,\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday. \"Don't the Democrats care about fighting American poverty?\"\n\nCNN'S CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT SAYS NETWORK'S 7-HOUR CLIMATE CHANGE TOWN HALL ISN'T ENOUGH\n\nHe went on to blast the Paris Climate Agreement, from which the president withdrew the U.S. in 2017. \"The badly flawed Paris Climate Agreement protects the polluters, hurts Americans, and cost a fortune. NOT ON MY WATCH!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nLeading Democratic candidates have vowed to rejoin the agreement as part of proposals that they say will prevent large-scale damage from climate change.\n\n\"The cost of inaction is unacceptable,\" the campaign for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., claimed. \"Economists estimate that if we do not take action, we will lose $34.5 trillion in economic activity by the end of the century. And the benefits are enormous: by taking bold and decisive action, we will save $2.9 trillion over 10 years, $21 trillion over 30 years, and $70.4 trillion over 80 years.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut the field's plans, many of which endorse the \"Green New Deal\" (GND), could inflict a heavy financial toll if conservative groups' estimates prove true.\n\nThe right-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute concluded that the GND would cost the average household at least $70,000 in the first year of its rollout, and a cool $250,000 dollars after five years. The Heritage Foundation predicted that reaching just a portion of the GND's emissions reductions goal would cost $15 trillion in gross domestic product.\n\nFox News' Joseph A.
