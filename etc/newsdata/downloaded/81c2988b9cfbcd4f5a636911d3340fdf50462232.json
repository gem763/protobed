We don\u2019t yet know whether that might be a real deal, or an agreement in principle requiring further work on the vexed question of customs arrangements on the island of Ireland.\n\nAs intensive talks on a Brexit deal resumed in Brussels today, UK officials played down hopes of an early breakthrough. One EU insider told me: \u201cWe can see the outlines of a deal, but turning it into a legal text is the hardest part.\u201d Another added: \"Today the mood music is more pessimistic than yesterday\" even if he pulls off a deal.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe negotiations are only the first hurdle Johnson must clear. He is very unlikely to deliver his pledge to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, and will probably have to accept a delay of either one, two or three months \u2013 the latter being the length stipulated by the Benn Act. On the face of it, Nigel Farage would have a field day. Yet Johnson might avoid huge damage if he gets a deal. Without one, a delay would be very damaging for him.\n\nHis highest hurdle might well be the Commons vote, scheduled for Saturday if there is a deal in place. A very close vote is in prospect. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, sounded complacent to me when he told LBC the \u201cvotes are there now\u201d for an agreement because \u201ceverybody\u2019s desperate to finish this.\u201d\n\nTrue, there is Brexhaustion in parliament as well as in the country. Relief at a deal only a week after one looked very unlikely will work in Johnson\u2019s favour. \u201cThe hope is that the momentum becomes unstoppable,\u201d one cabinet minister said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The penny has finally dropped in the European Research Group (ERG) that Brexit could be at risk, via an election or Final Say referendum, unless they bite the bullet now.\n\nThe bad news for Johnson is that the Democratic Unionist Party is not signed up. Ministers hoped they would buckle under pressure from businesses and farmers worried about no deal. But a customs border in the Irish Sea \u2013 which May said no British PM could accept \u2013 might prove a step too far for DUP MPs, who argue that \u201cour people\u2019s\u201d top three priorities are \u201cthe Union, the Union, the Union.\u201d\n\nThe DUP enjoys much more clout than having 10 MPs suggests. Several ERG members would take their cue from Arlene Foster\u2019s party. Johnson has kept her at least as closely informed about the negotiations as his cabinet, probably more so.\n\nBut without the DUP on board, Johnson would need the votes of more Labour backbenchers than he might land. Tory whips hope for 20 Labour backers, mostly representing Leave areas. They would like in principle to vote for a deal, which might enhance their survival prospects in an early election. On the other hand, defying a three-line-whip to oppose an agreement could see them deselected, and unable to run under Labour\u2019s colours.\n\nJeremy Corbyn was always going to oppose any Johnson deal, fearing he might cash in a Brexit dividend at an election. In fact, Johnson is making Corbyn\u2019s life easier, with an agreement Labour can portray as even worse than May\u2019s.\n\nDowning Street has kept secret its draft political declaration on the long-term UK-EU relationship to avoid frightening Labour horses. It is expected to drop May\u2019s pledges to meet EU standards, such as on workers\u2019 rights and the environment.\n\nSo Labour MPs tempted to back the likely deal should ask themselves why they would back a harder Brexit than they have already opposed. They should also note that right-wing, pro-deregulation Tories like Johnson\u2019s language about a \u201csuper Canada\u201d free trade agreement.\n\nIn fact, academics in the respected Britain in a Changing Europe group predict it would look more like \u201cCanada-minus,\u201d with minimal coverage of the service industries which account for 80 per cent of the UK economy. Its study found that GDP per capita 10 years after Brexit could be reduced by between 2.3 and 7 per cent, compared to remaining in the EU. For May\u2019s deal the numbers came in at between minus 1.9 and 5.5 per cent.\n\nDespite previous predictions that scores of Labour MPs would vote for a Brexit deal, only a handful did. History might repeat itself unless Johnson conjures up an unexpected rabbit and commits to a \u201clevel playing field\u201d like May. But then the Brexit see-saw would tip the other way; he would alienate many of the Tory Eurosceptics whose votes he also needs.\n\nMPs should look carefully before they leap, and not be bounced into approving a last-minute deal. It would probably look nothing like the one promised by Brexiteers in 2016. So MPs should do what they were sent to parliament to do and exercise their judgment. As the march in support of fresh vote heads to Westminster on Saturday while they debate a Johnson deal, MPs should recognise the overwhelming case to ask the people whether they support it in a Final Say referendum.", "description": "Boris Johnson wants, and arguably needs, to return from the two-day summit of EU leaders on Friday waving\u00a0 a \u201cdeal in our time\u201d piece of paper.
