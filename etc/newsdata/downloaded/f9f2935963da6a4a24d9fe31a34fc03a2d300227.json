(AP) - A second straight road win got D.C. United a step closer to securing a playoff spot.\n\nAn own goal put United up in the 25th minute and the team held on for a 1-0 victory over the Portland Timbers on Sunday. It was United\u2019s second straight win after a three-game losing streak.\n\nUnited (12-10-9) was denied another goal before halftime. Television replays appeared to show the ball cross the goal line before Timbers midfielder Eryk Williamson cleared it out.\n\n\u201cWe got the goal in the first half and the second half we dug in to keep the clean sheet and get the three points,\u201d United striker Wayne Rooney said. \u201cI think it was a tough game but the important thing is the three points.\u201d\n\nThe loss snapped a two-game winning streak for the Timbers (13-12-4). It was the Portland\u2019s fourth loss at home, most since the 2012 season.\n\nRooney returned to United\u2019s starting lineup after a two-game suspension for violent conduct in the 21st minute of a match against the Red Bulls on Aug. 21. Rooney leads the team with 11 goals and seven assists in 26 league appearances this season. The striker will leave United at the end of the season to become a player-coach for Derby County in England.\n\nBoth teams were fighting for playoff position. United was coming off a 3-0 road victory over the Montreal Impact, while Portland\u2019s last result was a 2-1 win at home over Sporting Kansas City.\n\nWith the win, United moved up to fourth in the Eastern Conference. The Timbers were sixth in the West before the results of Sunday\u2019s late games.\n\n\u201cI know mathematically it doesn\u2019t put us in a playoff spot just yet, but I think we\u2019d have to lose every game and the teams outside the playoff spot would have to win every game, which, if that happens, we don\u2019t deserve to be in it,\u201d Rooney said.\n\nTimbers captain Diego Valeri was disappointed Portland couldn\u2019t gain ground.\n\n\u201cWe needed the three points to get up on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we played a good game overall, dominated. We missed all our chances and they got a lot of luck in the goal. And they just defended so deep, we had our chances and we couldn\u2019t score.\u201d\n\nThe Timbers played a depleted squad against United with only 16 players available. Sebastian Blanco was nursing a lower leg injury while top scorer Brian Fernandez was out because of an illness. Defender Zarek Valentin was absent because of the birth of his child.\n\nUnited went ahead on the own goal when Portland defender Bill Tuiloma tried unsuccessfully to clear a cross from Ulises Segura. A second goal was denied in the 38th minute when Rooney\u2019s corner into the box bounced off Portland goalkeeper Steve Clark but was booted out of the goal by Williamson. United players pleaded that the ball crossed the goal line but the referee allowed play to continue.\n\nFollowing the match the pool reporter asked referee Drew Fischer about the call and use of video review.\n\n\u201cThe decision on the field was that the ball had not fully crossed the line. The VAR checked the play and determined that the available angles did not show a clean error,\u201d Fischer said in his written response. \u201cTherefore the VAR indicated \u2018check complete.\u2019\u201d\n\nPortland had a number of chances. Valeri\u2019s header in the 16th minute for the Timbers hit the post then skidded across the front of the goal. Jorge Moreira lofted a shot from distance in the 51st minute but United goalkeeper Bill Hamid pushed it just above the crossbar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one just because I thought the guys played very, very well against a good team, and we also had players that are missing,\u201d Timbers coach Giovanni Savarese said. \u201cAgain, very proud of the guys and the effort that they put in, and as I said we played a very good team and we outplayed them, but the game is about goals, not how many crosses, how many possessions, not how many good things you do.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A second straight road win got D.C.
