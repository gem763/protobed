It reported US$380 million in losses in its last quarterly report\u2014up almost US$100 million from the same quarter a year earlier\u2014and anticipates its burn rate to peak in 2019. The company noted in a recent letter to shareholders that investing in content production now will help temper losses starting next year. Netflix is doubling down on original content as it braces for competitors Apple and Disney to launch their own streaming services. Apple TV Plus, which launches next month, is almost half the price of Netflix\u2019s cheapest subscription option and will stream original content exclusively. In its earnings call last week, Netflix product chief Greg Peters said the company also plans to crack down harder on password-sharing in a bid to glean revenue from users who are skirting its policies.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
