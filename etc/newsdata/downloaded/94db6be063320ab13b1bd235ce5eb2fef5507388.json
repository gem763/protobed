The Washington Nationals reliever was overcome by his emotions after throwing a scoreless inning in Saturday's 5-4 loss to the Atlanta Braves.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAnd with good reason.\n\nThe 31-year-old right-hander was making his first MLB appearance since Aug. 5, 2015. In his time away, he was forced to undergo Tommy John surgery and later suffered a gruesome broken arm while throwing a pitch that threatened to end his career.\n\nThe best story in sports today involving an AB. https://t.co/eelAEUXSoS \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) September 8, 2019\n\nGrueling recovery\n\nSixteen screws were drilled into Barrett's arm, and numerous seeds of doubt were planted in his head by doctors who feared Barrett could suffer a similar injury if he returned to pitching.\n\nBarrett pushed on anyway, returning to the hill in 2018 after undergoing multiple operations. His comeback was paid off this season as he earned a return trip to the big leagues after a long, excruciating four-year journey.\n\n\u201cYou dream about the moment,\u201d Barrett said after the game, courtesy of MLB.com. \u201cYou picture the moment, you try to visualize what it's going to be like, and you know whatever moment or whatever happens, it\u2019s unlike anything you envisioned.\u201d\n\nCompleting the comeback\n\nBarrett was among the September call ups added to the Nationals roster earlier this week. The emotional moment when he was informed by Harrisburg Senator manager Matt LeCroy went viral, allowing his incredible comeback story to garner the attention it deserves.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow Barrett has put a stamp on his return after pitching a crucial inning for Washington on Saturday night. He was summoned in the fifth inning to face a red-hot Braves lineup, and responded by retiring three of the four batters he faced. That included a strikeout of All-Star outfielder Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr.\n\nWashington Nationals reliever Aaron Barrett sheds a few tears after making his emotional return to MLB.

That\u2019s when the wave of emotions hit me. It\u2019s just a special feeling.\u201d\n\nThe emotions hit manager Dave Martinez as well.\n\nFrom MLB.com:\n\n\u201cMan, what a moment,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe came in, his eyes were watery, and I was trying really hard not to cry in front of him. It was an unbelievable moment. We shared it together, we shared it with the team, and he did great. We got the bugs out, and he did great.\u201d\n\nBarrett won\u2019t have a featured role with Nationals this season. If they make the postseason, he won\u2019t be eligible for their roster. But there\u2019s nothing stopping him from turning heads and earning more opportunities in September.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Washington Nationals reliever Aaron Barrett makes emotional return to MLB.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/db4NChn9e8tXR_NCq0BdwQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C.r6CdiWeBERQv97El.iaA--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4dc7b050-d1e1-11e9-9bef-01dbe5b9e15f", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
