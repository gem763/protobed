In Orange County, a curfew remains in effect until 6 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service still reported winds of up to 43 miles per hour and gusts of up to 69 miles per hour near downtown Orlando.\n\nAt 5 a.m., Irma had 75 mph sustained winds \u2014 just 2 miles shy of becoming a tropical storm \u2014 and was moving north-northwest at 18 mph. The once mighty Category 5 storm was about 35 miles east of Cedar Key, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.\n\nMiami Herald: Hurricane Irma live updates: Curfew in the Keys, fallen trees blocking streets\n\n7:20 a.m.: Inescapable Irma, the hurricane that for a week tormented the entirety of the Florida peninsula unlike any storm that came before it, will finally find its way out of the state Monday.\n\nShe will leave behind destruction from Key West to probably Tallahassee. And yet the storm will also be remembered for what it wasn\u2019t: In the end, Irma was not the feared Category 5 catastrophe she could have been, though the extent of her damage is still unknown. The dual-coast storm has already been blamed for five deaths.\n\nOvernight, the Category 2 storm pushed into western Florida further south than expected, sparing vulnerable Tampa Bay from the worst of the surging Gulf of Mexico waters. By 2 a.m., it was a Category 1 inland storm moving northeast toward Orlando from Tampa. By 5 a.m., it was about to be downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nTallahassee Democrat: President Trump approves major disaster declaration\n\nPresident Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration on Sunday.\n\nThis declaration authorizes federal funding to flow directly to Floridians impacted by Hurricane Irma and reimburses local communities and the state government to aid in response and recovery from Hurricane Irma.\n\nThe Major Disaster Declaration approved by President Trump authorizes:\n\n\u2013 100 percent federal reimbursement for 30 days in all counties for emergency protective measures, such as emergency operation center costs, evacuation costs, sheltering costs, and other costs associated with emergency response. After the 30 days, the federal government will reimburse 75 percent of these costs. This includes both local and state expenses;", "description": "Tampa Bay Times: Hurricane Irma: Nearly 60 percent of Florida .09/02/2019 3:12:20AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
