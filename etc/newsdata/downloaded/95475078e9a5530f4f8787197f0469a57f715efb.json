That marks the fifth consecutive weekly fall in expectations, and would see inflation fall further below the central bank\u2019s official 2020 target of 4.00%.\n\nAnnual inflation is currently running at 2.89%, according to the latest official figures, well below the central bank\u2019s 2019 target of 4.25%, which policymakers say provides the space to continue cutting interest rates.\n\nThe latest FOCUS survey showed further stabilization in the near-term exchange rate outlook. For the fourth week in a row, the average end-2019 forecast for the real was 4.00 per dollar BRBY, roughly where it is trading early on Monday.", "description": "Brazilian inflation and interest rate expectations for next year have fallen to new lows, according to a central bank survey of economists published on Monday, strengthening the view that monetary policy will be loosened further in the months ahead.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
