[YONHAP]\n\nDirector Makoto Shinkai speaks at the press conference held in southern Seoul on Wednesday. [TOHO]\n\nPopular Japanese animation director Makoto Shinkai kept a promise that he made to his Korean fans three years ago to return to Korea with a new animated film. The movie, \u201cWeathering With You,\u201d is the highly anticipated follow-up to the 2016 smash hit \u201cYour Name.\u201dAt a press conference held at Lotte World Tower on Wednesday, the director said that he has a special fondness for Korea because it was Korean audiences who were one of the first to recognize and praise his debut feature film, \u201cThe Place Promised In Our Early Days\u201d (2004).\u201cI still had a vivid memory of me receiving a prize for the film 14 years ago at the award ceremony held in Coex,\u201d the director said. \u201cI have always visited Korea each time I make a new film and have accumulated so many fond memories here, so Korea always has a special place [in my heart].\u201dAlthough his works are animated fantasies, the director gets his inspiration from actual natural and social phenomena in Japan, which was also the case for his latest.\u201cI have asked whether or not Korean audiences acutely feel the changes in climate as much as Japan does, but they told me no,\u201d he said as he explained picking weather for his motive. \u201cHowever, in Japan, there are many natural phenomena - such as the heavy downpour of rain that Tokyo is experiencing nowadays - that led people to worry about the drastic natural occurrences.\u201dUnlike \u201cYour Name,\u201d the main characters in \u201cWeathering With You\u201d - Hodaka and Hina - live in relative poverty.\u201cFor \u2018Your Name,\u2019 I wanted the audience to yearn for this world, to make them want to live in such a place,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter three years however, I realized that the social atmosphere has changed. The young people living in contemporary society no longer wish or have a longing for extravagant and wonderful homes. They seem to give up hope from the very beginning and see those things as surreal. So I wanted to depict how the boy and the girl find joy despite their hardships and poverty.\u201dNevertheless, the director commented that the message of the film is neither constructive nor healthy.\u201cWhat Hodaka does to save Hina may be illegal, bad and harmful to others,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hodaka runs toward Hina only for her, so he does choose Hina over sacrifice of the rest of Tokyo. But I don\u2019t view Hodaka\u2019s actions as selfish because what he does is to save the person that matters to him most.\u201dThe director realizes that the film\u2019s ending may raise controversy, such as whether or not the sacrifice of one person for the greater good is worth it.\u201cBut I wonder whether the climate changes that the world is experiencing today is really any fault of the youth,\u201d he said. \u201cAdults and their ways of living life have caused these changes, so young people really have no responsibility over them. I wanted the characters to go in a different direction than what the adults want, leading them to make choices that the adults may not understand.\u201dThe film premiered in local theaters on Wednesday.BY LEE JAE-LIM [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/30193834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
