Executives estimated that the settlements would be finalized in the company\u2019s fourth quarter.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act probes began in 2013, with an inquiry by the SEC. The Justice Department launched its own probe in 2015. It wasn\u2019t until late 2016 that the company began working to improve its ethics and compliance program, according to Mr. Ekholm.\n\nThe investigations revealed violations of the U.S. foreign bribery law and the company\u2019s code of business ethics in China, Djibouti, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam, Ericsson said.\n\nThe breaches were the result of Ericsson\u2019s failure to follow up on red flags and inadequate internal controls, which allowed a number of employees to act for \u201cillegitimate purposes,\u201d Mr. Ekholm said Thursday, according to a transcript by S&P Capital IQ.\n\nEricsson hasn\u2019t seen any impact from the probes on its business, Mr. Ekholm added later in the call.\n\nThe $1.23 billion provision covers as much as $1 billion in estimated combined penalties from forthcoming settlements with the Justice Department and SEC, said Ericsson Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander.\n\nThe remainder accounted for costs related to the investigations, stretching back to the first quarter of the company\u2019s 2017 fiscal year, the executives said.\n\nEricsson Chief Legal Officer Xavier Dedullen said the company had so far disciplined 65 employees in relation to the FCPA violations, 49 of whom were no longer with the company.\n\nThe executives also left open the possibility that Ericsson\u2019s settlements could include the imposition of an independent monitor to oversee the company\u2019s compliance reforms.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get into the details of\u2026the discussions with the authorities, but it would not be a surprise if we ended up with a monitorship,\u201d Mr. Dedullen said.\n\nThe company has said it cooperated with the Justice Department and SEC investigations. A company spokesman declined to comment further on the provision.\n\n\u2014Josh Beckerman contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "The company, which announced the provision in a statement Wednesday, said the process to find a resolution with authorities was still ongoing.
