In an interview with Today\u2019s WorldView, center-left Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez lamented the effect of Trump\u2019s leadership on the world stage. That ranges from environmental policy \u2014 S\u00e1nchez expressed dismay that \u201cwe have someone leading the United States who doesn\u2019t believe in climate change\u201d nor appreciates the \u201curgency\u201d of the moment \u2014 to the Trump administration\u2019s confrontation with Iran.\n\n\u201cThe international agreement reached with the Iranian regime was very positive for the peace and security of the world,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, referring to the nuclear deal forged between Tehran and world powers that Trump chose to break. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity the United States put it into question.\u201d\n\nEncuentro cordial con el presidente iran\u00ed, @HassanRouhani, a quien he trasladado la importancia de Ir\u00e1n como actor regional, con capacidad de influencia sobre los conflictos abiertos, y le he exhortado a que haga lo posible por salvar acuerdo nuclear de 2015.#UNGA pic.twitter.com/pRTk9m5ho0 \u2014 Pedro S\u00e1nchez (@sanchezcastejon) September 24, 2019\n\nS\u00e1nchez said he rejects Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric on trade, particularly the administration\u2019s decision to cast European partners as national security threats as a way to slap tariffs on some of their exports. But he expressed confidence that the transatlantic relationship can be saved, because it is \u201csomething that overcomes administrations.\u201d On climate, he pointed to the work being done by several U.S. mayors and governors to curb emissions and build more sustainable economies, with or without federal support.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency nevertheless has had a definitive effect. Echoing an argument pushed by figures such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, S\u00e1nchez stressed the need for Europe to chart its own path on the world stage and move away from decades of sheltering under the umbrella of an American superpower.\n\n\u201cThe role that Europe must play, not only here, but in the years to come,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, is \u201cto create more balance\u201d in global politics. \u201cThere was a need\u201d for this degree of independence before, he admitted, \u201cbut it\u2019s also true that the new position of this U.S. administration has intensified the need.\u201d\n\nWhether S\u00e1nchez himself will have much of a role to play in that geopolitical shift remains to be seen. After being unable to build a stable ruling coalition, S\u00e1nchez threw in the towel and called for new elections in November. Spain\u2019s parliament dissolved this week. It\u2019ll be the country\u2019s fourth election in four years and the second one this year.\n\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s opponents on both the far left and the center-right blame him for not wanting to work with them. But in his conversation with Today\u2019s WorldView, he pinned the failure on his rivals for not recognizing the superior political mandate won by S\u00e1nchez and his Socialist Worker\u2019s Party in April.\n\n\u201cIf you use the multiparty system to block the formation of a government, this is damaging to democracy,\u201d he said, adding that the elections in November were now \u201ca great opportunity to overcome this blockage.\u201d\n\nThis might be a risky bet. Spain\u2019s fragmented political landscape will make it difficult for S\u00e1nchez to win an outright majority, even if his Socialists, the country\u2019s traditional center-left mainstay, do claw back a few more votes from parties to its left and right.\n\nThen there is the question of Catalonia, the wealthy northeast region where a secessionist movement triggered a constitutional crisis in 2017 by staging an independence referendum deemed illegal by Madrid. The tensions over Catalonia fanned political flames elsewhere, helping stoke the rise of Vox, a far-right party which claimed about 10 percent of the vote.\n\nAnd it will probably shadow the November election, too. In October, sentences are expected for a number of Catalan separatist leaders who appeared in a publicly televised trial on charges of sedition and rebellion.\n\nWhen asked by Today\u2019s WorldView if he would consider possible pardons for the Catalan separatist leaders, S\u00e1nchez said he would \u201crespect the work of the judicial power.\u201d He also criticized the \u201cundemocratic behavior\u201d of Catalonia\u2019s separatists, linking their demands for independence with a host of \u201creactionary movements\u201d that sprang up in Europe in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nEn un a\u00f1o, este Gobierno ha demostrado que los problemas de #Espa\u00f1a se pueden superar desde la \u00f3ptica progresista. Que se puede crecer y repartir, con justicia social, que se puede gobernar con limpieza y ejemplaridad, apostando por la convivencia. pic.twitter.com/JMB4nWubuT \u2014 Pedro S\u00e1nchez (@sanchezcastejon) September 17, 2019\n\nWhile Trump and Bolsonaro decried the perils of \u201csocialism,\u201d which the U.S. president branded \u201cthe wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies,\u201d S\u00e1nchez believes his party\u2019s politics are necessary in an age of climate change and yawning social inequality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to show people a progressive manner to face these challenges,\u201d he said, pointing to his ambitious goals for renewable energy in Spain that, as of now, have not dented his support among the traditional rural working class that earned a living in industries related to fossil fuels.\n\nLast year, his government struck a deal with unions to shut down most of the country\u2019s coal mines but also inject hundreds of millions of euros in investment in those regions. \u201cWe went there and spoke to them and told them we weren\u2019t going to leave them behind and alone,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to show people that we have to face this transition and this transition must be fair.\u201d\n\nIt is that sort of reckoning with inequality, he suggests, that can thwart the siren song of nationalists and populists. Unlike Trump, or former Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, S\u00e1nchez has taken a welcoming approach to refugees seeking safe passage to Europe.\n\n\u201cSpain accepts diversity as an asset,\u201d S\u00e1nchez declared. \u201cWe are an inclusive country.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
