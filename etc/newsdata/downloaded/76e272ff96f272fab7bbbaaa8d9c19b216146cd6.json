He said the second segment should open \u201cwithin months\u201d of the first.\n\nMaryland grants contractor 5-month delay in Purple Line opening\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see the point of not letting people ride on it and delaying that [first segment] opening while the remainder of the system is completed,\u201d Lattuca said.\n\nThe Purple Line will run between Bethesda in Montgomery County and New Carrollton in Prince George\u2019s, with the highest ridership expected between Bethesda and Silver Spring.\n\nPeter van der Waart, chief executive for Purple Line Transit Partners, the team of private companies building the line and helping to finance its construction, said the first segment\u2019s western terminus will depend on where trains can turn around.\n\nAreas west of the test track include Riverdale Park, College Park and the University of Maryland\u2019s flagship campus.\n\nThe line\u2019s initial opening in Prince George\u2019s would be a big payoff for a deal that former county executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) made with the Maryland Transit Administration in 2015. Baker agreed to commit an additional $20 million in county funds \u2014 for a total $120 million toward the Purple Line\u2019s construction \u2014 in exchange for construction starting in Prince George\u2019s and the command center being located there. Getting the command center and rail yard ensured that the first track would be laid nearby.\n\nPurple Line project gets new CEO amid cost, schedule disputes\n\nThe news that their residents would probably have to wait longer to ride the Purple Line didn\u2019t sit well with some Montgomery council members, who noted that the county is contributing about $227 million toward the project.\n\nCouncil member Evan Glass (D-At Large) said after the meeting that he was frustrated to hear the line will open in segments.\n\n\u201cThis project is over budget, and its timeline is delayed,\u201d Glass said. Hearing that it will open in two phases \u201cis disappointing, especially for a transit rider like me,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers said they want the state to remain focused on getting the entire project done.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep the whole line on track,\u201d said council member Hans Riemer (D-At Large). \u201cIf they can make something happen earlier, great, but the real power comes when the whole line opens.\u201d\n\nProject officials said the Purple Line\u2019s construction is 17 percent complete, and work is occurring along 12 of the 16 miles. Light-rail trains, which are being assembled in Upstate New York, are expected to arrive in Maryland for testing in late 2021.\n\nA Q&A with the new Purple Line project CEO\n\nLattuca said the state is still negotiating a \u201clegal settlement\u201d with Purple Line Transit Partners about how much each side will pay to make up for construction delays. The contractor says delays have added $300 million in costs, but state officials have said the contractor is responsible for some of the problems.\n\nThe ongoing dispute has drawn attention because the Purple Line\u2019s $5.6 billion public-private partnership is one of the broadest of its kind for any U.S. transit project. The line\u2019s construction comprises about $2 billion of the contract.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The first segment will open in late 2022, but exactly where hasn\u2019t been determined, Maryland officials say.", "authors": ["Katherine Shaver", "Reporter Covering Urban Planning", "Transportation Issues"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QMOFPCWQAQI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
