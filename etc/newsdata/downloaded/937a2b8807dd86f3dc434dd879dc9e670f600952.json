I know that the EU is not willing to make many concessions on this. The deal has been done between 27 members as it is,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a setback for Johnson and his strategist Dominic Cummings, who hope a clear majority in parliament will clear the path for a Brexit deal of their choice, he said that an election may not solve the issue.\n\n\u201cEven after a new election, there might still be a possibility that you get a deal which is not much different than the one you have now.\n\nBoris Johnson 'confident' EU will back down in Brexit talks Read more\n\n\u201cIt might solve the internal problem of having a parliament which is in a difficult situation, but it probably won\u2019t do much to solve the problem in finding an agreement with the EU. We have to be realistic about this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think another government would come [and get] a completely different result,\u201d Krings added.\n\nIt was his first time at a Tory party conferenceand he said that he almost cancelled because of the chaos in British politics.\n\n\u201cI had some second thoughts about coming, not that I was not eager to go, but I didn\u2019t want to look like some sort catastrophe tourist,\u201d he said.\n\nHe underlined the unity of the EU. \u201cI don\u2019t think the German government will do anything that Ireland does not like,\u201d he said, adding that this was a protective move for the bloc.\n\n\u201cThe EU is not in a very positive or good condition either, so that has made it more clear that it was very important for other states to stay together, to have a consensus.\u201d\n\nKrings said that if the UK crashed out of the EU it would be faced with a dilemma with no upsides.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t reach a deal soon, I think there\u2019s just a choice between two bad choices for Britain \u2013 to leave without a deal, which might risk wrecking the UK economy, or prolonging the Brexit [crisis] which might wreck the UK political system,\u201d he said.", "description": "G\u00fcnter Krings tells Conservative conference election will not solve Brexit", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c2b462b8d8a33174c3c03f482cdecd2a4c700d4/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=28ab078ece6094fcd806c9333dfc4fdb", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
