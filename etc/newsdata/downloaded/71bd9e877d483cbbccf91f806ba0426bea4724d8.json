This Week's Star Witness Hasn't Even Testified Yet.", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is taking a beating from within his own administration on impeachment. And it could get worse by week\u2019s end.\n\nOn Tuesday, National Security Council member Alexander Vindman told Congressional investigators that he was so alarmed by Trump and a top U.S. diplomat\u2019s actions toward Ukraine that he voiced his concerns to NSC lawyers. Naturally, his remarks triggered a rage-tweetstorm from the president.\n\nBut Vindman isn't even this week\u2019s star witness from Trump's NSC. That would be Tim Morrison, an NSC member tasked with overseeing policy for Russia and Europe, who is scheduled to testify on Thursday. According to what\u2019s already been said in closed-door testimony, his testimony could be the most explosive yet.\n\nRead: White House Official Will Say He Confronted Trump\u2019s EU Ambassador Over Ukraine\n\nGiven Morrison's role as Trump\u2019s top Russia aide, he\u2019s well-positioned to fill in key details of President Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to push Ukraine to investigate his political rivals \u2014 as well as knock down Republicans\u2019 defense that other witnesses\u2019 credible allegations of quid pro quo aren\u2019t valid because they were based on secondhand knowledge.\n\n\u201cHe brings this ever closer to Trump\u2019s doorstep,\u201d said Richard Arenberg, a longtime former congressional Democratic staffer who has foreign policy and intelligence expertise.\n\nMorrison was mentioned 15 separate times by Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor in last week\u2019s damning testimony, and he could corroborate some of Taylor\u2019s most troubling claims.\n\nRead: The 5 Bombshells From Bill Taylor's Testimony on Trump and Ukraine\n\nMorrison\u2019s attorney told VICE News his client plans to come to share what he knows, in defiance of the White House\u2019s blanket ban on administration officials testifying.\n\n\u201cIf subpoenaed, Mr. Morrison plans to appear for his deposition,\u201d Morrison\u2019s attorney Barbara Van Gelder said in an email, declining to discuss any part of his planned testimony.\n\nMorrison will be the second NSC adviser to testify this week, after Vindman\u2019s testimony Tuesday. According to Vindman\u2019s prepared opening remarks, he was so \u201cconcerned\u201d with Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president that he took his worries to the NSC\u2019s top attorney \u2014 and before that confronted a top Trump official for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nBut Morrison may have even more damning information about Trump\u2019s push to force Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nHe\u2019ll be a tough witness for Republicans to ignore.\n\nMorrison has spent his career as a leading Capitol Hill foreign policy hawk. He\u2019s long held a dim view of Russia, which stands to benefit from a damaged U.S.-Ukrainian relationship, and according to those who worked with him, he fiercely advocated for more robust support for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cTim was an excellent staffer, the best\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also known personally by a number of Republican members: Morrison\u2019s last job before joining the NSC last summer was as the top GOP policy staffer on the House Armed Services Committee. Before that he was then-Sen. Jon Kyl\u2019s (R-Ariz.) top foreign policy adviser, helping Kyl lead the Senate charge against ratifying a nuclear arms-control treaty between the U.S. and Russia.\n\n\u201cTim was an excellent staffer, the best,\u201d Kyl told VICE News in an email.\n\nMorrison was brought onto the NSC in June by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton, a fellow saber-rattling foreign policy hard-line hawk, to focus on nuclear arms agreements. He moved over to work on Russia and Europe when Trump forced out Fiona Hill, another hawk and Bolton ally, in mid-summer. Bolton was fired on Sept. 10 after reportedly attempting to stand up to Trump and Giuliani on Ukraine, but Morrison has stuck around.\n\nThat gives him a unique view into what Trump and his underlings were doing in Ukraine.\n\nTaylor said in his opening statement that Morrison relayed a conversation that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland had with a top Ukrainian official.\n\nTaylor also said that Morrison was on Trump\u2019s now-infamous phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. According to Taylor, Morrison said the call \u201ccould have been better.\u201d Morrison also allegedly told Taylor that Trump had suggested the Ukrainian president meet with Attorney General Bill Barr as well as Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, who allegedly set up a shadow foreign policy to pressure Ukraine to do Trump\u2019s political bidding.\n\nThose already convinced of Trump\u2019s wrongdoing say Morrison could help clear up any ambiguity for lawmakers.\n\n\"He\u2019ll have firsthand information,\u201d former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul told VICE News. \u201cThe more first-hand information, the clearer the story. But again, for me the story is very clear.\"\n\nOn August 22, according to Taylor, Morrison told him that Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t \u201cwant to provide any assistance at all\u201d to Ukraine and that \u201cit remains to be seen\u201d whether the administration still stood by America\u2019s long-held policy of strong support for Ukraine.\n\nA number of Democrats on the trio of committees responsible for the impeachment investigation declined to talk specifics of what they want Morrison to address. But they indicated that he could help them fill in gaps and corroborate other testimony like Taylor\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt's like a bank robbery where you have a dozen witnesses and you want to call in each witness to fill in a different part of the picture. And we are getting a very textured and fine-grained portrait of exactly what happened,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) told VICE News.\n\nMorrison\u2019s testimony could further fill in the picture. But it\u2019s unclear exactly what type of witness he will turn out to be. There are signals that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with what Trump and his aides were doing. But he\u2019s also an aggressive conservative warrior known for his sharp elbows who\u2019s spent his career warring with Democrats \u2014 a man the Daily Beast described as a \u201cnuclear superhawk\u201d whose Twitter avatar was a red MAGA-style hat that read \u201cMAKE DETERRENCE GREAT AGAIN.\u201d\n\nEven those who\u2019ve worked with Morrison aren\u2019t sure how things will play out on Thursday.\n\nOne former Kyl staffer who worked closely with Morrison said he had \u201cincredibly patriotic convictions\u201d and wouldn\u2019t do anything to harm national security, but that he was also a good foot soldier and \u201can incredibly loyal person\u201d who \u201cknows when to keep his mouth shut.\u201d\n\nAnd Morrison\u2019s personal loyalties may lie less with Trump and more with Bolton, who brought him in and reportedly described what Giuliani and his cronies were trying to accomplish in Ukraine as a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d Bolton is reportedly in talks with the committee to come and testify himself, a bad sign for Trump.\n\nAnother former Morrison colleague from Kyl\u2019s office said if Morrison was alarmed, he wouldn\u2019t shy away from letting the committee know.\n\n\u201cHe was squeaky-clean. If this guy\u2019s freaked out, that\u2019s completely legitimate to me,\u201d said the former GOP Hill staffer. \u201cHe would do the right thing, too. I would never see him engaging in any kind of cover-up.\u201d\n\nGreg Walters contributed to this story.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump departs O'Hare International Airport after speaking at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Annual Conference and Exposition, Monday, Oct. 28, 2019, in Chicago.
