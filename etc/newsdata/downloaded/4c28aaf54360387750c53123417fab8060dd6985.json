She has not been a Gallo recording artist for over 9 months. Everything with Gallo ended amicably,\" he said.\n\nThis comes after reports alleging that the 25-year-old is currently suffering from depression due to her music career not being successful and also not being able to leave Gallo sufficed.\n\nResponding to those allegations, Cowling denied that Noma was suffering from depression and said that the allegations were untrue.\n\n\"To my knowledge this is not true. Noma can easily be contacted and has confirmed to us she is fine, and the allegations are untrue. In fact Noma released and has been promoting her own new single since July!,\" he said.\n\nIt is not the first time that the record label has been criticized.\n\nDuring a memorial service held for the late Thami Shobede who died in September, his best friend, Themba Humana put the label on blast for not being there for Thami during his illness and for allegedly not paying him his royalties.\n\n\"We called Gallo to say he is in hospital, but they never responded to us. Gallo was not there for Thami. He had a contract with Gallo. He wanted to get out of the contract. All his gigs came from his friends and Gallo still demanded a percentage,\" Humana claimed.\n\n\"Thami never got anything from his royalties,\" he continued.\n\nOn paying royalties to Noma, Cowling said that the label would still report on royalties that may be generated for her songs released under Gallo.\n\n\"However, any royalties for the material released since 2016 due to Noma will have been reported bi-annually as per her past contract with details reflected on the statements. Gallo will continue to report on any revenues that may be generated for her songs released under Gallo,\" he said before addressing how many false allegations were being made about Gallo Records and saying it was a pity Noma had been dragged into them.\n\n\"It seems there are many similar incorrect allegations flying about regarding Gallo, to which we have issued statements on our website. To have Noma now dragged into more false allegations and incorrect information is bordering on slander and defamation against Gallo. It is also unfair to Noma, who has moved on with her career, and is no longer signed to us. She could also do without any false publicity,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "This comes after reports alleging that Noma is currently suffering from depression due to her music career not being successful and also not being able to leave Gallo sufficed.", "authors": ["Mahlohonolo Magadla"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9429/d7c4e82193964c06845c5f06db3f62a7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
