I guess you could say it\u2019s an osmosis of sorts (or a very welcome exchange): flavour in, texture and sustenance out.\n\nLamb pilaf with sweet almonds and sour plums (above)\n\nIranian dried sour plums, known as aloo bukhara, are like nature\u2019s candy; they are beautifully orange, sweet, sour and hard to resist.\n\nYotam Ottolenghi\u2019s chilli recipes Read more\n\nThey are used in a variety of Persian dishes but are also great to snack on. You can find them in most Middle Eastern supermarkets, but if you can\u2019t get your hands on any, then use dried apricots or sour cherries instead. This is a celebration dish, perfect for sharing and well worth the effort.\n\nPrep 20 min\n\nCook 55 min\n\nServes 6\n\n3 tbsp olive oil\n\n1 onion, peeled and thinly sliced (150g)\n\n6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n\n500g lamb mince (20% fat)\n\n\u00bd tsp saffron threads, roughly crushed\n\n1 tsp ground cardamom\n\n1\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon\n\n1 tbsp dried rose petals\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n300g basmati rice, washed and soaked for 1-2 hours in plenty of cold water, then drained\n\n20g dill, roughly chopped\n\n10g parsley, roughly chopped\n\nFor the sweet almonds\n\n1\u00bd tsp olive oil\n\n4 tsp caster sugar\n\n\u00be tsp ground cinnamon\n\n100g blanched almonds\n\nFor the sour plum dressing\n\n10g dill, finely chopped\n\n10g parsley, finely chopped\n\n1 green chilli, finely chopped (10g)\n\n150g dried sour plums, pitted and roughly chopped (or 100g dried apricots, quartered)\n\n3 tbsp cider vinegar\n\n60ml olive oil\n\n\n\nHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4 and line a small oven tray with baking paper. On a medium-high heat, warm three tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan for which you have a lid. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and browned \u2013 about seven minutes. Add the garlic, lamb, saffron, cardamom, cinnamon and half the rose petals, and cook, stirring to break up the mince, until no longer pink, about four minutes. Add 250ml water, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for seven minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid is absorbed.\n\nAdd the rice, herbs, 520ml hot water, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and bring to a boil. Cover the pan tightly with foil, then a lid, and turn the heat to its lowest setting. Cook for 15 minutes, then set aside, still covered, for another 15 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, make the almonds. Put the oil, sugar, cinnamon and a tablespoon of water in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring often, then add the almonds. Cook, stirring, for three minutes, then transfer to the lined oven tray and bake for 12 minutes, stirring once halfway, until golden. Leave to cool, then roughly chop. Meanwhile, mix all the dressing ingredients and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a small bowl.\n\nTo serve, spread out the rice on a large platter. Top with the almonds and remaining rose petals, and spoon over the dressing.\n\nOne-pot chicken with orzo, porcini and cinnamon\n\nYou can\u2019t get much more than this tender chicken by way of comfort and pure deliciousness. My favourite bit, though, is the orzo pasta, which drinks in all the chicken juices. Serve this with your favourite savoury chilli sauce, if you like.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s one-pot chicken with orzo, porcini and cinnamon.\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nCook 1 hr 45 min\n\nServes 4\n\n3-4 dried cascabel\n\nchillies (25g)\n\n4 cinnamon sticks\n\n30g dried porcini\n\n1 whole chicken (1.5kg)\n\nSalt and pepper\n\n2 lemons, 1 halved and the other cut into 4 wedges\n\n60ml olive oil\n\n500g celery (about 6-8 sticks), cut at a slight angle into 4cm lengths\n\n2 onions, peeled, and each cut into 8 wedges\n\n6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced\n\n8 thyme sprigs\n\n320g orzo\n\n1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley leaves, roughly chopped\n\nHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6. Put the chillies and cinnamon in a small frying pan on a medium-high heat, and cook for about eight minutes, or until fragrant and toasted. Transfer to a large bowl with the porcini mushrooms and 1.1 litres boiling water. Cover with a plate and leave to soak for at least 15 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, pat the chicken dry and sprinkle all over with half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, then stuff the cavity with one lemon half.\n\nPut a large ovenproof, cast-iron saucepan, for which you have a lid, on a medium-high heat and add two tablespoons of oil. Add the chicken and cook on all sides until browned \u2013 about seven minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate, add the remaining two tablespoons of oil to the saucepan, along with the celery and onion, and cook for six minutes, until lightly golden. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for another minute, until fragrant. Return the chicken to the pan breast side up, then pour over the porcini liquid, along with all the aromatics, two teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir through the orzo, pushing some into the bird\u2019s cavity. Cover again and bake for 20 minutes more, until the orzo is cooked and has absorbed most of the liquid.\n\nTurn up the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7, uncover and bake for 10 minutes, or until browned on top. Leave to cool slightly \u2013 10-15 minutes.\n\nTo serve, squeeze over the other lemon half, sprinkle with the parsley and serve directly from the pan, with the lemon wedges alongside.\n\nCharred shallots cooked in freekeh\n\nThe unique smoky and nutty qualities of freekeh are amplified here with the addition of charred shallots and cascabel chillies. The dish is robust enough to be served as a main course, with some lightly cooked greens or a chopped salad alongside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s charred shallots cooked in freekeh.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 1 hr 5 min\n\nServes 4\n\n3\u00bd tbsp white miso paste (70g)\n\n60ml olive oil\n\n1\u00bd tbsp maple syrup\n\n1 tbsp tomato paste\n\n5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n\n\u00be tsp ground cinnamon\n\n500ml vegetable stock\n\nSalt and pepper\n\n350g medium banana shallots (about 8-10), peeled\n\n3 dried cascabel chillies, roughly broken\n\n350g cracked freekeh, soaked in cold water for half an hour, then drained\n\nFor the tahini sauce\n\n80g tahini\n\n1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed\n\n2 tbsp lemon juice\n\nTo serve\n\n1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley leaves finely chopped\n\n2 tbsp chives, finely chopped\n\n3 tbsp olive oil\n\nWhisk the first seven ingredients together in a large jug with 400ml water, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper.\n\nPut a large saute pan for which you have a lid on a high heat. Once hot, add the shallots and char for 16 minutes, turning a few times, until slightly blackened all over. Add the cascabels and char for 90 seconds more, until fragrant. Pour over the stock mixture, bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, until the shallots begin to soften.\n\nCarefully transfer the shallots to a plate for a moment while you stir the freekeh into the sauce, then return the shallots to the pan, spaced apart. Cover with the lid again, and cook for 15 minutes, or until the freekeh is cooked through and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, leaving the lid on, and set aside for 10 minutes.\n\nPut the tahini sauce ingredients in a small bowl with four tablespoons of water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and whisk smooth. In a separate small bowl, combine the parsley, chives and oil.\n\nDrizzle half the tahini sauce over the freekeh, followed by all the herb oil.
