Any future programming changes we are considering do not involve her.\"\n\nORIGINAL STORY:\n\nMegyn Kelly's scheduled appearance on Fox News Wednesday night had a lot of people speculating. Kelly hasn't been on Fox News since she left the network in early 2017.\n\nIn her interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson, Kelly discussed the allegations in Ronan Farrow's new book and urged NBC to hold an outside investigation into the allegations of sexual misconduct at the network. NBC is the same network that fired Kelly over her controversial comments earlier this year. On her NBC show, Kelly remarked that it was \"okay\" to wear blackface as a Halloween costume when she was a kid.\n\nKelly's interview with Carlson on Wednesday night lasted several segments, including one on NBC's wall-to-wall coverage of Brett Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick and NBC's lack of coverage in the case of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer.\n\n\u201cThey went to air with that story. With far less trepidation than they showed in going to air on the Harvey Weinstein story for which they had tapes. They had tapes. They had witnesses,\" Kelly said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome saw Kelly's interview on Fox News as a trial run for a possible return to the network. The speculation is fueled by the recent departure of longtime anchor Shepard Smith last week. Smith was an anchor on Fox News for 23 years, ever since the network began broadcasting.\n\nBREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces that former Fox News host Megyn Kelly will be on his show on Wednesday\n\n\n\nThis comes after Shepard Smith abruptly resigned from his role on Friday \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 15, 2019\n\nIs megyn kelly auditioning for shep\u2019s open time slot? ?? \u2014 CC (@ChatByCC) October 17, 2019\n\nPrediction.
