Toward the end of the film\u2014shortly before he warns Charlton Heston\u2019s character not to search for the truth \u201cbecause you may not like what you find!\u201d\u2014he monologues that the hoi polloi (chimps and gorillas in this case) must be shielded from certain realities lest they be driven to insanity and nihilism.\n\nThe legacy media are having their Dr. Zaius moment, paternalistically shielding their infantile audience (read: you and me) from ugly images and realities. This is not simply a revolting development but a deeply troubling one that will only accelerate the ongoing loss of confidence and trust the public has in media. According to polling done for the Columbia Journalism Review, fewer than 20 percent of us have a \u201cgreat deal of confidence\u201d in the press. The only institution held in lower esteem is Congress.\n\nYet the media seem happy to keep digging their own grave. Yesterday, for instance, The New York Times reported on what it called a \u201cmacabre video of [a] fake Trump shooting media and critics\u201d that was shown at a conference held at one of the president\u2019s own properties (Trump had nothing to do with the conference or the video, which the White House has condemned). You\u2019d assume the paper would link to or embed the video in support of its characterization. But it refused to, even as it\u2019s safe to say that it was the Times\u2019 coverage that helped bring the video to a large viewing audience (that\u2019s how I learned about it).", "description": "", "authors": ["Nick Gillespie", "Reason.Com The-New-York-Times-Nbc-And-Other-Outlets-Dont-Trust-You-To-Handle-The-Truth"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
