The remarks came months after reports of his ties with Epstein surfaced.\n\n\u201cBeing taken advantage of by someone who is ... so depraved is something I\u2019m embarrassed I\u2019m even close to,\u201d said Wexner, according to CNBC. \u201cIn the present, everyone has to feel enormous regret for the advantage that was taken of so many young women.\u201d\n\nThe apology comes as Wexner, along with other L Brands LB, +3.81% executives, are under pressure to turn around its marquee Victoria\u2019s Secret, whose once loyal fans have fled for other alternatives that offer more comfortable fits and have a more inclusive image.\n\nThe CEO has said he completely severed ties with Epstein nearly 12 years ago.\n\nEpstein started managing Wexner\u2019s money in the late 1980s and helped straighten out the finances for a real estate development Wexner was backing in a wealthy Columbus, Ohio suburb.\n\nIt was through Wexner that Epstein acquired his Manhattan mansion, a seven-story, 21,000 square foot former prep school less than a block from Central Park.\n\nWexner sold his entire interest through which he owned the home to an entity owned by Epstein on Nov. 11, 1998. The home, located across the street from the Frick Collection and a residence owned by Bill Cosby, has been valued at approximately $77 million. It\u2019s considered one of the largest single residences in Manhattan.\n\nEpstein was arrested in July on federal sex-trafficking charges, drawing new attention to allegations he had sexually exploited women and girls. He killed himself in jail in August while awaiting trial.\n\nWexner publicly accused Epstein of misappropriating \u201cvast sums\u201d of his fortune after Epstein was charged by federal authorities this summer. He didn\u2019t offer details on the alleged thefts.", "description": "The chairman and CEO of Victoria\u2019s Secret parent L Brands says he is \u201cembarrassed\u201d by his former ties with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, according...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR039_wexner_ZG_20190910162159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
