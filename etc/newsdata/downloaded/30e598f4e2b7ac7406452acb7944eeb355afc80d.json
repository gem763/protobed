Written and recounted by McLean, fans across the country turned up in droves when he began taking the show on the road.\n\nThe two new four-disc sets of material feature 13 Dave and Morley stories never previously available on CD. It also includes, for the first time, stories about the towns and cities the show travelled to over two decades.\n\nPostcards from Canada features essays about 21 different locations, including Tofino, B.C., where McLean recorded the show in January 2015 shortly before suspending his tour for cancer treatment.\n\n'I think that theatre was the smallest venue we ever played,\" said longtime show producer Jess Milton about the 72-seat theatre in an interview on CBC's On The Island. \"What they didn't have in numbers, they made up in enthusiasm.\"\n\nMilton said the small community on the west coast of Vancouver Island had always been on McLean's bucket list and the two were excited to finally record there.\n\nStuart McLean recording The Vinyl Cafe at the Tofino theatre in 2015.

She likened the collection to a family photo album that captures everyday life in Canada.\n\n\"You have a really good sense of what the country is like, what the people are like and what matters to Canadians,\" said Milton.\n\nMore information and to purchase Vinyl Cafe 25 Years Volume I: Dave and Morley Stories and Volume II: Postcards from Canada is available at vinylcafe.com.", "description": "The two new four-dics sets feature 13 Dave and Morley stories and 21 essays about different Canadian towns and cities written and performed by the late Stuart McLean that were never previously available on CD.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5321921.1571173780!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/vinyl-cafe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
