They said in a statement that arguments made by the company on the proposal were \"inconsistent\" with the comprehensive analysis done by the city and its financial advisers.\n\n\"We aren't surprised by PG&E's response so far,\" the two officials said. \"We're also not giving up. Now more than ever, it is clear that we must take back control of San Francisco's electric service and achieve energy independence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Shanti S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Leslie Adler)", "description": "The offer significantly undervalued the assets and a deal would not be in the best interest of the company's customers, PG&E's chief executive officer, Bill Johnson, wrote in a letter to San Francisco Mayor London Breed and City Attorney Dennis Herrera.
