It was the first decline since a 0.5% drop in February.\n\nConsumer spending was strong in the spring and economists had been counting on continued strength to protect the U.S. economy as it is buffeted by the fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nThe spending decline in October, which was unexpected, was influenced by special factors including a big 0.7% decline in sales at gasoline stations, a decline that likely reflected falling gas prices during the month.\n\nThe overall economy grew at a 2% annual rate in the April-June quarter with much of that strength coming from a 4.6% surge in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of economic activity.\n\nThat spending pace had been expected to slow in the July-September quarter but still remain strong enough to support economic growth near the 2% rate seen in the spring.\n\nEconomists are worried that a slowing global economy and the adverse impact of the U.S.-China trade war could slow overall growth so much that the country could see an increasing risk of a recession ending the current record-long U.S. expansion, which began in June 2009.\n\nIn addition to the drop in gasoline sales, sales of autos fell 0.9% in August after a solid 1.9% increase in August.\n\nSales at department stores were down 1.4% while sales at general merchandise stores, which include chain retailers such as Walmart and Target, fell 0.3%.\n\nSales also dropped at hardware stores, grocery stores and sporting goods stores. Clothing stores, restaurants and health care stores all saw increases.\n\nSales in a retail control group which focuses on key components that go into computations of GDP were unchanged in September after a 0.3% gain in August.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Retail sales dropped in September by the largest amount in seven months, possibly signaling that rising trade tensions and turbulent", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/0f3f39_retail-sales-01784-in-sept-23-2019-photo-shoppers-examine-refrigerators-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
