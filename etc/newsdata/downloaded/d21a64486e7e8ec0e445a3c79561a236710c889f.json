REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader/File Photo\n\nLev Parnas, one of the two associates of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, served as a translator for lawyers representing oligarch Dmytro Firtash. Parnas was arrested on Thursday along with the other Florida businessman, Igor Fruman, on unrelated charges that included illegally funneling $325,000 to a political action committee supporting pro-Trump candidates.\n\nBoth men had worked in an unspecified capacity for Firtash before Parnas joined the Ukrainian\u2019s legal team, according to a person familiar with the Florida men\u2019s business dealings with Firtash.\n\nThe Floridians\u2019 connection to indicted oligarch Firtash injects an intriguing new character into the rapidly unfolding drama surrounding the effort to impeach Trump.\n\nDemocrats in the U.S. House of Representatives launched the impeachment inquiry, the first step in unseating a U.S. president, over allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to help investigate Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nGiuliani was probing discredited allegations that Biden, when he was vice president, sought the firing of Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor to halt the investigation of a gas company on which his son, Hunter Biden, was a board member. The Bidens have denied the claims, and the Trump camp has produced no evidence to support the assertions.\n\nFirtash, one of Ukraine\u2019s wealthiest businessmen, is battling extradition by U.S. authorities on bribery charges from Vienna, where he has lived for five years.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Illinois said in court papers in 2017 that Firtash was an \u201cupper-echelon\u201d associate of Russian organized crime. He was indicted in 2013 and charged with bribing Indian officials for access to titanium mines. Firtash has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nFirtash was \u201cfinancing\u201d the activities of Parnas and Fruman, the source familiar with their business dealings said. The source did not detail their specific work for the oligarch or how much money he had paid them and over what period.\n\nU.S. lawmakers have sought to question the pair about their involvement in Giuliani\u2019s investigation as part of the impeachment inquiry. Giuliani told Reuters in an interview that Parnas and Fruman - U.S. citizens who were born in Ukraine and Belarus, respectively - had helped \u201cfind people for me in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Parnas was working for Firtash\u2019s legal team, Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing. The firm worked on Firtash\u2019s criminal and extradition cases.\n\n\u201cMr. Parnas was retained by DiGenova & Toensing, LLP as an interpreter in order to communicate with their client Mr. Firtash, who does not speak English,\u201d the Washington-based firm said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for the firm said Fruman was not retained in any capacity. DiGenova and Toensing did not comment further on Firtash\u2019s business dealings with the two men in response to questions from Reuters.\n\nJohn Dowd, the lawyer representing Parnas and Fruman, confirmed to Reuters that Parnas had worked for Firtash\u2019s legal team as an interpreter. But Dowd also told the U.S. Congress that both men worked for DiGenova and Toensing.\n\nOn Oct. 3, Dowd wrote Congress to say the two men could not provide certain information about Ukraine because they were partially covered by attorney-client and other legal privileges. Dowd based the privilege claim on the fact that the two men assisted lawyers DiGenova and Toensing; that they had worked for Giuliani; and that Giuliani had previously represented them in their personal and business affairs.\n\nDowd\u2019s letter did not mention Firtash. He declined to respond to a request to clarify whether one or both of his clients worked for Firtash\u2019s legal team.\n\nParnas\u2019s role as an interpreter for DiGenova and Toensing was reported on Thursday by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nFLIGHTS TO VIENNA\n\nThe person familiar with Parnas and Fruman\u2019s business affairs told Reuters that both men had been working for Firtash for several months before Parnas joined the Ukrainian mogul\u2019s legal team, and that Firtash has paid their expenses in the past. Their costs include private jet charters in the United States and foreign travel to Vienna, according to the source, who is familiar with their finances.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters the two men had been to Vienna - where Firtash lives - three to six times in the last two months. Giuliani declined to comment on the reasons for their travels. He said he did not know about any business relationship between Firtash and the two men that helped him investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cThey could be involved in business with each other,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know. They may be involved in his defense.\u201d\n\nFirtash is a former supporter of Ukraine\u2019s ousted pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovich. He made a fortune selling Russian gas to the Kiev government. An Austrian court in June cleared the way for his extradition to the United States, but Firtash\u2019s legal team continues to fight it.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters last month, well before his arrest, Parnas said Firtash had been framed by U.S. prosecutors and diplomats.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has coffee with Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, U.S. September 20, 2019.

He\u2019s one of the most honest businessmen out there. Incredible businessman.\u201d\n\nParnas told Reuters that Firtash was the victim of a cabal that he alleges was involved in suppressing corruption by Joe Biden and his son in Ukraine. \u201cSame people involved,\u201d he said. \u201cSame characters.\u201d\n\nParnas declined to comment on the specific work he performed for Firtash, referring questions to the oligarch\u2019s lawyers, Toensing and DiGenova.", "description": "One of the two Florida businessmen who helped U.S. President Donald Trump's personal attorney investigate his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, also has been working for the legal team of a Ukrainian oligarch who faces bribery charges in the United States, according to attorneys for the businessmen and the oligarch.", "authors": ["Aram Roston", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439802620&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1X3", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
