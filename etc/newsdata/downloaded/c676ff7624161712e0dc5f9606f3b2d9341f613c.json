Democrats claimed in the court filing that under Section 6103 of the US tax code, the Treasury \"shall furnish\" any document requested by the House Ways and Means Committee chair.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's unclear why Trump has not released his tax returns.\n\nA New York Times investigation suggested that he may have engaged in tax schemes, including fraud, during the 1990s.\n\nTrump is also dealing with another, separate whistleblower complaint, lodged in August, which sparked the House to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The complaint, which was declassified last week, centers around a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and alleged that Trump used his power for his own political gain.\n\nThe White House last week also released a memo about the call, which appeared to confirm that Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into corruption allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.", "description": "An August 8 letter, written by House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, discusses the allegations.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93f08a2e22af6d0f48f6a9?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
