Third-graders ditch recess, head to fast-food joint over mile away from school", "language": "en", "text": "Were the McNuggets worth it, kids?\n\nA couple of third-graders at an elementary school in Holly Springs, N.C., will reportedly be facing \u201cappropriate disciplinary action\" after disappearing from the school\u2019s grounds and making a beeline for a McDonald\u2019s about a mile away.\n\nBURGER KING CUSTOMER CLAIMS GRANDDAUGHTER WAS SERVED RAW CHICKEN SANDWICH\n\nThe Holly Grove Elementary School shared the news in an email to parents, the Raleigh News and Observer reported, in which Principal Sarah Simmons explained that the two students were first noticed to be missing after their recess period ended. A search of the campus was conducted before police were called in.\n\nThe kids were eventually located after someone called the school to report unattended students at the McDonald\u2019s, which, according to Google Maps, is at least 1.6 miles away on foot.\n\nSimmons added that, in addition to the students, who will be made to \u201cunderstand the severity\u201d of their unscheduled and unapproved field trip, the faculty will \u201cuse this as a learning opportunity to continue to improve our supervisory practices.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs of press time, it was unclear if the students had planned on returning to school after presumably filling up on whatever McDonald\u2019s they could afford, or whether they planned to hit up the Dairy Queen or Chick-fil-A restaurants that are also conveniently located on the route to the Holly Springs McDonald\u2019s.", "description": "Were the McNuggets worth it, kids?", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/RunningKidiStock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
