Since then, Halperin has not given a major interview, posted a tweet, or publicly opined on politics.\n\nIn a 25 minute-long interview on Sirius XM with host Michael Smerconish, the Game Change author reiterated his apology to the women he harassed, as well as to his colleagues and family.\n\n\u201cI know that I\u2019ve grown in my understanding of all this, I know I need to continue to grow, I wasn\u2019t a perfect person when I made these mistakes, I\u2019m not a perfect person now, I\u2019m happy to be judged by perfect people,\u201d he said.\n\nHalperin explained that in the years since his ouster, he has been working with the Fortune Society, a New York nonprofit that helps formerly incarcerated individuals acclimate to life outside of prison, including preparing people for job interviews and finding housing.\n\nBut he also said that he\u2019s had \u201chundreds\u201d of conversations with women who have been harassed \u201cto really understand why it\u2019s so painful\u201d to experience workplace harassment.\n\nThe goal of these conversations was to try and reach a point where he could return to work and make his two-year-old son proud.\n\n\u201cI want my son to grow up respecting me and seeing in me a fuller person than what happened to me 17 months ago,\u201d Halperin said.\n\nWhile Smerconish led the interview with questions about Halperin\u2019s life and reflections on his mistakes, he also quizzed the former prominent pundit on his opinions on issues of the day\u2014including one related to sexual misconduct.\n\nWhen asked about Biden\u2019s alleged inappropriate touching, Halperin noted that some people likely weren\u2019t \u201cthe least bit interested in what I have to say about a topic like this,\u201d and then offered a pundit-like assessment.\n\n\u201cI think this is a bit of a distraction. As serious as the charges are, and then as important as this debate is, I think Joe Biden is, despite his standing in the polls, is an extremely overrated candidate,\u201d he said.", "description": "Nearly two years after being fired over sexual harassment claims, the ex-pundit resurfaced for a chat and apologized again before opining on the ex-veep\u2019s own creepy behavior.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1554403087/190404-tani-halperin-tease_qogfat", "published_at": "2019-04-04"}
