Following its latest founding round, the company is now valued at $5.5 billion. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to announce that Klarna co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski will join us at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin.\n\nIf you live in Europe and regularly purchase stuff online, chances are you\u2019ve used Klarna already. The company offers a simple way to pay for e-commerce purchases over multiple installments.\n\nAnd it\u2019s been massively successful in Europe. You could think as Klarna as a sort of credit card-alternative payment method. Even if you don\u2019t have a credit card, you can choose to purchase something right now, pay after 30 days or pay over 3 or 4 installments without any interest.\n\nThis way, expensive payments become slightly easier for customers. And if there\u2019s a problem with your purchase, Klarna ensures that you don\u2019t have to pay or get your money back \u2014 your money never left your bank account in the first place.\n\nJust like using a PayPal account, if you pay on another site that uses Klarna, you don\u2019t have to enter your payment information again. Merchants that leverage Klarna gets paid instantly after a purchase, even if clients choose to pay later.\n\nKlarna is also building a marketplace of stores. You can download the mobile app and search for products across multiple stores. This could become a great alternative to e-commerce giants like Amazon.\n\nUp next, Klarna wants to grow its presence in the U.S. While it already has millions of customers and thousands of merchants, the company thinks there\u2019s still a ton of potential in the U.S.\n\nIf you want to know how a Swedish startup plans to disrupt the credit card industry in the U.S., buy your ticket to Disrupt Berlin to listen to this discussion \u2014 and many others. The conference will take place December 11-12.\n\nIn addition to panels and fireside chats, like this one, new startups will participate in the Startup Battlefield to compete for the highly coveted Battlefield Cup.", "description": "Klarna is quietly becoming a fintech giant.
