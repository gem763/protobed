Only Samwu can remove the deadlock.\n\n\"This is not a disagreement between the City and firefighters but a conflict between the City and Samwu.\"\n\nREAD: Firefighters engaged in 'misinformation campaign' about overtime pay - City of Cape Town\n\nSamwu's Sebenzile Kiva previously explained that firefighters were employed to work 40 hours a week but, in most cases, they ended up working between 72 and 80 hours a week.\n\nProvincial secretary John Mcanjana said firefighters would fulfil their contractual obligations and work their required eight hours and clock out at 16:30.\n\n\n\nBosman explained that it has a firefighting staff complement of more than 900, with a minimum of 240 firefighters on duty at the 30 fire stations at any given time.\n\n\n\n\"The minimum resource requirement for a fire station is one fire engine and a maximum of six staff members. Critical fire stations have already been identified where a minimum level of service will still be available to the City,\" he said.\n\n\"Should Samwu members refuse to work the standby hours, the Fire and Rescue Service will redeploy staff on duty to critical fire stations where any staff shortages may occur, call on day shift staff on the standby roster to man critical appliances (vehicles), call on staff on their rest days to make up any staffing shortfall and call on assistance from neighbouring municipalities in terms of a standing agreement in the event of major incidents.\"\n\nALSO READ: Cape Town firefighters demand overtime pay, deliver warning to City ahead of fire season\n\nBosman said disciplinary steps would be initiated against any employee who refuses to work the standby hours as they would be in contravention of their conditions of service.\n\n\"Furthermore, there have been threats of intimidation and staff on the receiving end of such threats have been encouraged to report these incidents so that they can be investigated and action taken against the responsible parties.\"", "description": "While all of the City of Cape Town's fire stations have been operating with a full staff complement, it will have to \"wait and see\" if this remains the case after the SA Municipal Workers' Union warned that firefighters will no longer work overtime owing to a pay dispute.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/427966b8196e4ac0bb19afdd3e9c032d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
