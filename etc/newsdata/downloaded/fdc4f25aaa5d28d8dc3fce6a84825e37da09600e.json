We thought you might be in need of a little assistance if Alan falls asleep - so hope this little care package helps. Love and blessings from Ros and Grace. P.S The snoring usually only last a short time - while he falls asleep.\n\n'I'd heard of mums giving out little care packages when they have babies on planes - acknowledging that their infants might be crying,' Grace told The Mirror.\n\nMr Tatrersall said Grace and her mother were 'cheeky' to have handed him the care packages.\n\n'I knew I snored but I didn't think for a moment it was that bad,' he said.\n\n'I was flying from Melbourne to Houston - it's quite a long flight. On the way back it was about 32 hours, including three stopovers, so I thought I'd better give them out.'\n\nHe said he handed most of them out but some were immediately watching a film and putting their own headphones on once they were seated.\n\nOne woman immediately tore open the package and had a chuckle when she read it, according to Mr Tattersall.\n\nOthers thought it was strange that he had handed them out.", "description": "Alan\u00a0Tattersall, 62, was preparing for a business trip that would see him fly from Melbourne to Houston, Texas.
