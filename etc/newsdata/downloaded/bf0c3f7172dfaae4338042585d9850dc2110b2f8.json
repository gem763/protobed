REUTERS/Alisson Frazao\n\nBolsonaro also appeared to row back comments from Monday, when he suggested the oil could be from a shipwrecked vessel, suggesting the evidence did not suggest such a cause. He also said he did not want to blame another country without proof, or it would cause a problem.\n\n\u201cIf it was a shipwreck, oil would still be coming up. It is more probable that something was dumped there criminally,\u201d Bolsonaro told reporters.\n\nA study by state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, suggests the oil came from Venezuela, according to a person familiar with the matter, who suggested that the volume of oil pointed to a sunken oil tanker.\n\nPetrobras said that molecular tests on the organic material in samples of the crude oil showed they were not compatible with the oils it produced and sold. The company declined to say whether the oil slicks were from Venezuelan crude.\n\nThe oil has washed up in recent weeks on more than 100 beaches in nine northeastern states from Maranhao to Bahia. Its origin has generated an array of speculative explanations amid growing environmental concern.\n\n\u201cIt does not look like a criminal spill. It seems to be accidental,\u201d said the person familiar with the Petrobras study, who requested anonymity because the report is not public.\n\nSpeaking before a Congressional hearing on Tuesday, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said the amount of crude collected so far - over 500 barrels - rules out the source being an oil tanker cleaning its tanks at sea.\n\nThe presence of oil along such a extension of coastline indicates that \u201csomething extraordinary\u201d had happened, he said.\n\nCastello Branco said, however, that it was not the company\u2019s responsibility to investigate where the oil had come from, because that was the job of the Brazilian Navy and police.", "description": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Tuesday that mysterious oil slicks polluting northeastern beaches likely had criminal origins, without explaining further.", "authors": ["Rodrigo Viga Gaier", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438610587&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971XL", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
