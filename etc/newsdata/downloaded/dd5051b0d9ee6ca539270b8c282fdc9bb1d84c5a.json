The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1% to 7,874.15, a drop of 88.72 points.\n\nRead: History says the stock market\u2019s volatile August paves the way for more losses in September\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Beige Book, an anecdotal account of financial conditions the central bank\u2019s districts, isn\u2019t necessarily a market moving report but have been closely followed of late for signs of stress in the system amid the yearlong Sino-American trade conflict.\n\nThe survey on Wednesday showed that overall the economy expanded at the same \u201cmodest pace\u201d seen in earlier reports this year, despite intensifying tariff conflicts, highlighted this weekend by the U.S. and China following through on implementing increases to respective import duties. Still, a majority of business owners \u201cremain optimistic about the near-term outlook,\u201d the Fed found.\n\nManufacturing and agriculture, however, were the two weak spots in the late summer and shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to investors after a report on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s purchasing manager\u2019s index, showed a reading of 49.1 last month, down from 51.2 in July, its lowest since January 2016. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction.\n\nWall Street stocks had been bouncing back after upbeat news from Hong Kong set the tone for global markets after Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would scrap an extradition bill that sparked months of protests in the region and raised worries that those conflicts could eventually hurt the business environment and global financial markets.\n\nAlthough the withdrawal of the extradition bill only meets one of five demands from protesters, mostly young students, it has given investors some cause to cheer. Hong Kong stocks jumped 3.9% on the reports, as gauged by the Hang Seng Index HSI, -0.19% , marking its biggest one-day gain since November.\n\nAlso boosting optimism toward the greater Chinese economy were state-media reports, cited by Reuters, that the People\u2019s Bank of China will soon implement cuts in the reserve requirement ratio for Chinese banks, in a move that analysts predict will boost growth and signals willingness by the government to take steps necessary to combat the effects of higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\n\u201cChina seems willing to move forward with monetary stimulus, and possibly more fiscal stimulus as well to put its best foot forward into October,\u201d when the People\u2019s Republic of China will celebrate its 70th anniversary, Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist for U.S. institutional equities at INTL FCStone, told MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cIf you want to celebrate by showcasing prosperity, sovereignty and peace, you don\u2019t want to be doing so against the backdrop of protests and a slowing economy,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K. Parliament late Tuesday took steps toward preventing a no-deal exit from the European Union. Newly installed Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered a major defeat as lawmakers voted to seize control of the Brexit agenda, prompting him to threaten to call for snap elections.\n\nStill, the 328 to 301 vote on Tuesday, clears the way for Johnson\u2019s opposition to introduce a bill later Wednesday to prevent Britain from leaving the EU without a deal Oct. 31.\n\nPierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades wrote in a daily research note that the optimism over political developments has renewed investors\u2019 buying appetite after a selloff a day ago, which marked an ugly start to trading in September.\n\n\u201cThis renewed confidence has quickly spread to the rest of the world, especially Europe, where investor sentiment had already been boosted by political events in the U.K\u2026,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso on investors\u2019 radar were a series speeches from Federal Reserve officials Wednesday, including comments by New York Fed President John Williams at a Euromoney conference in New York that signaled while the U.S. economy remains in a \u201cfavorable place,\u201d the outlook was worse than previously thought, leaving the door open for the Fed to cut rates for the second straight meeting, set for Sept. 17 and 18.\n\nDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, a nonvoting member of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, told an audience in Toronto that he is keeping an eye on consumer surveys to determine whether a slowing economy is affecting this key engine of the U.S. economy, according to Bloomberg.\n\nSeparately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Wednesday that the central bank estimates \u201cthat the U.S. economy\u2019s trend growth potential currently stands at around [1.75%],\u201d and he said it could go to 1.5% or below, if the economy sees less competition and less innovation, as well as more immigration restrictions, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn other data, the U.S. trade deficit fell nearly 3% in July on rising exports, though the balance remains higher than last year, despite efforts by the Trump administration to reduce it.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of coffee-chain Starbucks Corp. SBUX, -2.20% closed 0.7% lower after the company cut its forecast for earnings-per-share growth in fiscal 2020, citing a \u201cpull forward\u201d of expected share repurchases into 2019.\n\nShares of Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, -1.23% fell 7.8% after the processed foods manufacturer lowered its earnings-per-share guidance for the full-year 2019 after the markets closed Tuesday.\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, -5.71% was in focus after the airliner reaffirmed its guidance for unit revenue growth, despite weak-than-expected demand from China. Shares rose 0.9% Wednesday.\n\nShares of JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU, -2.96% fell 4.5% Wednesday, after the air carrier reduced its unit revenue outlook for the third quarter.\n\nCoupa Software Inc. COUP, +0.58% announced second-quarter earnings results that beat analyst expectations Tuesday evening. The business software provider\u2019s stock rose 8.7% Wednesday.\n\nShares of Michaels Cos. Inc. MIK, -10.13% rallied nearly 12% after the arts-and-crafts retailer topped estimates for its fiscal second quarter and offered upbeat guidance.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.67% receded by 1.3 basis points to 1.456%.\n\nIn commodities markets, the price of crude oil US:CLV19 finished up 4% to about $56.26 a barrel, while the price of gold GCZ19, +1.27% added 0.3% to end at $1,560.40 an ounce, turning positive from earlier declines and adding to a 1.5% surge on Tuesday to reach a more-than-six-year high. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.14% a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, retreated 0.5% to 98.51.\n\nIn Asia, equities were mostly higher, as the China CSI 300 000300, -0.99% rose 0.8% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.49% edged up 0.1%. European stocks, meanwhile, closed higher with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, -2.70% rising 0.9% and the U.K. FTSE 100 UKX, -3.23% ending 0.6% higher.", "description": "U.S. stocks ended solidly higher Wednesday, holding gains after a survey on business conditions in the Federal Reserve\u2019s key districts show that economic...", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Mark Decambre", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FW736_durabl_ZG_20171020150416.jpg"}
