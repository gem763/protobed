According to the document, the exchange\u2019s CEO, Claudio Oliveira,claimed his crypto holdings in a 2018 filing with the RFB. Although the document is genuine, it is not possible to know if the numbers reported are accurate or the most current, due to tax filings in Brazil being self-reported.\n\nScreenshot of Oliveira\u2019s 2018 tax filing. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nDespite the fact that the tax filing is for Oliveira\u2019s personal funds, legal experts told Cointelegraph that Brazilian law could potentially demand the CEO\u2019s personal assets to cover the firm\u2019s debt. Oliveira\u2019s Bitcoin is more likely to be seized if his company is found to have engaged in fraud and was not the victim of a hack, as the company\u2019s representatives have stated.\n\nFirm under investigation\n\nOliviera\u2019s personal holdings are surfacing amid the company\u2019s recent legal troubles and an ongoing police investigation into its activities.\n\nIn May, Grupo Bitcoin Banco claimed that it had become embroiled in a security breach that saw some customers double the balances of their accounts and withdraw money that did not exist, as Cointelegraph Brasil reported. The cost of the purported hack could amount to 50 million Brazilian reals ($13 million).\n\nAlthough Grupo Bitcoin Banco has always maintained it was the victim of a hack, the firm has yet to offer any evidence in support of that claim. On June 6, a judge from the State of Paran\u00e1 ordered the firm to provide evidence of the hack in its defense against a former client\u2019s lawsuit. Grupo Bitcoin Banco never shared evidence of the hack with the court. On July 2 the firm settled with the former client for an undisclosed amount.\n\nStarting in May, customers of all of Grupo Bitcoin Banco\u2019s exchanges had their funds frozen, preventing withdrawals and trades. At that point, the firm became the subject of several lawsuits and legal actions.\n\nIn June, a judge at the Court of Justice of the State of Sao Paulo froze accounts associated with the firm amid both complaints from the exchange\u2019s clients that they could not withdraw their funds and allegations of \u201cabusive practices.\u201d The clients claimed that they had a total of 726,630 reals (about $174,000) on the platform and urged the judge to seize the funds.\n\nAs of mid-August, over 20,000 clients had been affected, with Grupo Bitcoin Banco facing roughly 200 ongoing lawsuits, ranging in damages claimed from $3,000 to $3 million. Following searches of the company\u2019s bank accounts, the court could not find money to reimburse the customers who had unsuccessfully tried to withdraw their invested funds. But at the time courts were not aware of Oliveira\u2019s personal Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe cover page of Oliveira\u2019s 2018 tax filing.

BTC is like any other property, even if it's not regulated. \u201cIf he [Oliveira] were to sell some of his BTC without declaring it first, he would then have to explain where this fiat money came from. So, according to the annual tax declaration rules, he must declare his BTC if he has any.\u201d\n\nThe tax filing also includes several cars, which were subject to a search-and-seizure warrant earlier this year, including a BMW X5, two Land Rover Sports, a Maserati Ghibli and a Mercedes Benz C300.\n\nThe document also notes shares in various companies as well as bonds, savings and real estate holdings of 14 different properties in various locations across Brazil.\n\nWhat now? Legal experts weigh in\n\nGBB argues that the private Bitcoin holdings of Oliveira are not in anyway related to the GBB's Bitcoin holdings or the debts to its clients. In a statement to Cointelegraph, a GBB representative commented on the tax document, saying:\n\n\u201cIt should be clarified that the data of a private individual are totally different from that of an individual that legally belongs to the group [Grupo Bitcoin Banco].\u201d\n\nHowever, local legal experts told Cointelegraph that Brazilian law could theoretically demand Oliveira\u2019s personal assets \u2014 the most valuable of which is his reported BTC holdings \u2014 to cover Grupo Bitcoin Banco\u2019s debt. There is precedent for seizing private assets in recent Brazilian history, most notably when former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva had his assets frozen during a sweeping corruption probe known as \u201cOperation Car Wash.\u201d\n\nIn another case more akin to the predicament with Grupo Bitcoin Banco, the assets of Eike Batista and his sons \u2014 totaling 1.6 billion Brazlian reals (about $385 million) \u2014 were frozen. Batista reportedly used a Panama-based company, The Adviser Investments, to manipulate markets, commit insider trading and conceal clients\u2019 financial activity. A Rio de Janeiro judge had the Batista family\u2019s assets seized for the duration of the criminal investigation.\n\nSpeaking with Cointelegraph, Novaes Neto explained the relationship between company debt and the owners of those companies:\n\n\u201cThere is a distinction between the individual and the legal entity. In general, the owner is not charged with a company's debt. But there is a legal provision that allows, in certain situations, to request the 'disregard of legal personality' and reach the partners of the company individually, as individuals. This happens in cases where there is abuse of legal personality, misuse of purpose, property confusion, among other things. In such cases, the judge may determine the extent of the charge to the private property of the partners or directors of the legal entity. This has become increasingly common in Brazilian law.\u201d\n\nFrancisco Sandrin, a federal district public defender and professor of business law, told Cointelegraph that in cases of criminal fraud, a company\u2019s debts may be transferred to the owners or directors of a company:\n\n\u201cOnce the fraud is recognized, the judge may order the attachment of the partners' assets to pay the company's debts and vice versa.\"\n\nWith the extent of Oliveira\u2019s personal Bitcoin wealth now a matter of public record, it remains to be seen if he will be forced to use those funds to pay Grupo Bitcoin Banco\u2019s debts. That all depends on whether judges determine if Grupo Bitcoin Banco was indeed hacked or if this has been a case of fraud all along.\n\nOlivia Capozzalo and Kollen Post contributed to this report.", "description": "The CEO of crypto firm Grupo Bitcoin Banco, which froze clients\u2019 funds in May, disclosed owning 25K Bitcoin", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8xMWM1ZjE5OGRjNTFlYjZkNDQzMWE0ZGVlOGVkMDkzZC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
