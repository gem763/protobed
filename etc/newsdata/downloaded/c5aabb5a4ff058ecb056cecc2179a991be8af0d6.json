Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican who will face off against Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood in the Nov. 5 election, will hold a $500-a-plate fundraiser with Mr. Trump and his wife at a hunting lodge near Hattiesburg.\n\nThe Trumps then will attend the annual Good Ole Boys and Gals BBQ in Oxford, the home of the University of Mississippi, or Ole Miss. Mr. Trump and Mr. Reeves are both expected to speak. The barbecue is a well-known event, an old-fashioned affair where people mill about with cocktails and fried catfish and chicken. Any politician who desires can deliver a 15-minute stump speech.\n\n\u201cThis is like the small-town version of the Neshoba County Fair,\u201d said Marvin King, a political science and African American studies professor at Ole Miss. \u201cAs a college town, Oxford might be a little less hospitable to Mr. Trump, but not by much because the county is still Republican.\u201d\n\nThe race between Mr. Reeves and Mr. Hood remains close by all accounts \u2014 a Mason-Dixon telephone poll gave Mr. Reeves a 3-point edge with neither candidate over 50% \u2014 but President Trump remains popular in a state he took in 2016 with nearly 60% of the vote.\n\nGov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, is term-limited, and Mississippi remains a Republican stronghold. Mr. Hood, however, has won multiple races statewide and presents himself as a pro-Second Amendment moderate, and Democrats hope he can capture the governor\u2019s mansion for his party for the first time since 1999.\n\nPresident Trump is slated to join Mr. Reeves at a rally in Tupelo, just west of Oxford, on Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re honored to have Donald Trump Jr. here to support Tate and help us to defeat Jim Hood,\u201d Reeves campaign spokesman Parker Briden told The Washington Times. \u201cThe people of Mississippi are behind Trump and are excited to have him here. The event in Oxford is always a big draw for people all over the area. It should be a fun night and help us to defeat the Democrats this November.\u201d\n\nThe biggest issues in the race are taxes and health care.\n\nMr. Hood promises to expand Mississippi\u2019s Medicaid rolls through Obamacare, a move he says would provide health care to some 300,000 residents and help struggling rural hospitals stay open. His version, called Mississippi Cares, was crafted by some of the hospitals. Patients would be charged small fees to help the state meet its portion of the costs.\n\nMississippi is one of 14 states that have declined to expand Medicaid through Obamacare.\n\nMr. Reeves considers such a move ruinously expensive. He points out that the health care plan has never come close to matching the numbers its supporters claim it will cover and cost. Instead, he has proposed boosting medical school scholarship money and starting rural residency programs around the state.\n\nNeither the Reeves nor the Hood campaign responded to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
