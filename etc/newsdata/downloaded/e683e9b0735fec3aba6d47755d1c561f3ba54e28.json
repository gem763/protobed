If you\u2019re rolling your eyes right now, you\u2019re right to have a healthy bit of scepticism: The feds have been pestering Facebook to get serious about this initiative for the better part of a decade at this point, well before the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nThe FTC hit Facebook with a $7 billion fine in July (an impressive-sounding amount until you realise that\u2019s less than a third of the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings this year) for the incident wherein 87 million users had their personal data compromised. Facebook\u2019s also continuing to field FTC and U.S. Justice Department investigations, albeit for antitrust concerns.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s interview, Zuckerberg said more than 1,000 employees are planned to work an FTC-mandated \u201ccomprehensive privacy program to protect consumers\u2019 information.\u201d Facebook originally agreed to this order in 2012 after an alarmingly similar \u2014 though not quite as massive \u2014 user privacy scandal. One of the company\u2019s veteran marketing executives, Michel Protti, has already been tapped as the program\u2019s chief privacy officer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the same internal controls and audits around people\u2019s personal data as we do as a public company around financial data and the information that we have,\u201d Zuckerberg told Fox News.\n\nAll told, he said the company has roughly 30,000 employees assigned to maintaining security online and a budget dedicated to this end that purportedly dwarfs Facebook\u2019s entire yearly revenue back when it first went public in 2012.\n\n\u201cI understand that people have a lot of concerns about this, and in the past we\u2019ve made mistakes and we need to make sure that we can earn people\u2019s trust,\u201d Zuckerberg continued. \u201cWe can do that by operating at a level of rigour and having a privacy program that sets a whole new standard for the industry over time.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve been hearing the Zuck hock grandstanding commitments and claims a lot recently.\n\nNo doubt because Facebook and its executives are quietly sweating over plummeting user trust surveys in response to, really, any one of these scandals in the last few years:\n\nFacebook framing a secret database of users\u2019 contact information as an anti-terrorism effort\n\nThat vampiric Onavo app the company peddled to monitor users\u2019 devices\n\nWhen it paid teenagers to essentially install Facebook spyware on their phones\n\nOr how about when the co-founder of WhatsApp left because even he was grossed out by their purported attempts to mine user data\n\nThough, of course, you might not guess they\u2019re shaking in their boots given their press statements; for example, earlier this year, Zuckerberg called Facebook an \u201cinnovator in privacy\u201d with a straight face.
