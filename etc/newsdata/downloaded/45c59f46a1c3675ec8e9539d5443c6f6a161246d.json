They\u2019re very smart in that way.\u201d\n\nWeggen lives in central Sweden and has won several awards for his wildlife photography.\n\nTalking about how he captures his images of the animals, Weggen explained it often requires a great deal of patience.\n\n\u201cI cannot tame a wild squirrel. They do exactly what they want,\u201d he said. \u201cI can wait a very long time for my shot.\u201d\n\nOccasionally, it helps to entice the squirrels with food.\n\n\u201cI know they\u2019re always searching for food, so I might hang a little bucket with seeds in the air. If I want them to pick up a pencil, I spread a little peanut butter on it.\u201d", "description": "An award-winning photographer has captured a group of squirrels playing with pumpkins ahead of Halloween.
