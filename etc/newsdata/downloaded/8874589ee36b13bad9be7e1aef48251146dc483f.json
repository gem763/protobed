Breaking into the Palace, they ripped it from the wall and drove off, leaving \"significant damage and flooding.\"\n\nThe 18 carat lavatory, called \u201cAmerica\u201d, was the centrepiece of a new exhibition by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan at the Duke of Marlborough's country home where Winston Churchill was born.\n\nIt had been plumbed into the water system so that visitors could fully engage with the artwork, as long as they obeyed a three-minute time slot.\n\nHowever, just hours after the launch party for the show finished, police say thieves using at least two vehicles smashed their way into the property, and made off with the expensive artwork.\n\nThe toilet was plumbed into the water system at Blenheim Palace Credit: Heathcliff O'Malley More\n\nQuickly, a 66-year-old man was arrested in connection with the theft, but the golden toilet is still missing amid fears it may be melted down. Last night, he was being questioned by detectives.\n\nThe artwork had previously drawn huge crowds at New York's Guggenheim museum when it first went on display in 2016, and was later offered to Donald Trump in a satirical jibe at the President.\n\nIts new home was a small stall adjacent to Churchill\u2019s birthing room, just off the Great Hall and near to the main entrance, where smashed glass was spotted. The thieves would have had to navigate the vast corridors to reach it.\n\nIncredibly, Edward Spencer-Churchill, half-brother of the current Duke of Marlborough and founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, told the Sunday Times last month: \u201cDespite being born with a silver spoon in my mouth I have never had a s*** on a golden toilet, so I look forward to it.\" Asked if he was worried about security, he said: \"It\u2019s not going to be the easiest thing to nick.\n\n\u201cFirstly, it\u2019s plumbed in and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate. So no, I don\u2019t plan to be guarding it.\u201d\n\nHome to the 12th Duke of Marlborough and his family, Blenheim Palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built as a gift to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, from Queen Anne and a grateful nation in thanks for his victory at the Battle of Blenheim on 13 August 1704.\n\nNo-one was injured in the nighttime raid at Blenheim Palace Credit: Leon Neal/Getty Images More", "description": "When a solid gold toilet worth \u00a31m was installed at Blenheim Palace, the founder of its art foundation proudly boasted: \"It\u2019s not going to be the easiest thing to nick\u201d.", "authors": ["Jamie Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v3y4VirxpG3ZrmWgPfQWFw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/a5210fca46fafe21c7405eccec45538a", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
