REUTERS/Aaron Bernstein\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mark Zuckerberg has grasped Facebook\u2019s big problem \u2013 and its best defense. Zuckerberg acknowledged in a recording leaked on Tuesday that the U.S. government would probably try and bust up his $500 billion social network if Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren wins the presidency next year. His argument: Making tech firms smaller would be counterproductive for preventing election interference. He\u2019s right on both counts.\n\nThe Harvard dropout said he would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to protect the empire that counts Instagram and WhatsApp among its holdings, in a transcript of internal meetings published on the Verge. The combative approach is very different from the contrite image the Facebook boss presented when grilled by Congress earlier this year. While it would \u201csuck\u201d to hash it out in a legal battle, he believes he would emerge victorious. That\u2019s only likely to inflame detractors.\n\nWhere Zuckerberg does Facebook more favors is in arguing that a breakup would be counter to the national interest. A bigger company would be better able to combat bad actors trying to sway political outcomes. Twitter faces the same foes but, being less than one-twentieth Facebook\u2019s size in revenue terms, wields a smaller arsenal. It\u2019s analogous to the situation banks face when it comes to cybersecurity. Scale makes them a target, but helps them bear the costs of building sturdy defenses.\n\nFacebook\u2019s detractors will need to decide what they want. Dissecting tech firms would reduce their hold on personal data, but if the goal is make them monitor what\u2019s published on their networks more effectively, a different fix is required. Currently, internet companies are protected from liability for what users post, with the exception of a few carve outs, such as sex trafficking. Rolling back those protections would force tech behemoths to sift the sludge \u2013 and eat further into Facebook\u2019s roughly 40% operating margin. Zuckerberg might have two battles on his hands.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Mark Zuckerberg has grasped Facebook\u2019s big problem \u2013 and its best defense.
