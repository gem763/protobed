Marsha Blackburn: Big Tech sees YOU as the product \u2013 Here's what we can do about it", "language": "en", "text": "This morning, I instinctively reached for my phone to check the weather report.\n\nMy first cup of coffee paired nicely with a scroll through my Wall Street Journal news app, and I streamed a news program during my workout.\n\nBefore I got in the car (but after I used my navigation app to check the traffic) I paused and considered the scope of Big Tech\u2019s influence over even the most mundane aspects of my life.\n\nARKANSAS AG EXPLAINS MASSIVE ANTITRUST PROBE OF GOOGLE: COMPANY HAS 'INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF POWER'\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve shared the same thought. Perhaps it was a moment of clarity when YouTube inexplicably suggested you turn on location tracking, or when Facebook refused to clear its own notifications until you authorized access to your phone\u2019s photo album or contact list.\n\nThey\u2019re just \u201csuggestions,\u201d of course, but the level of persistence with which tech companies request unfettered control over customer data makes those asks feel like an explicit demand.\n\nDepending on how closely you\u2019re paying attention, you\u2019ve probably noticed that only a handful of companies are doing the asking.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTwo of those companies \u2014 Facebook and Google \u2014 are in hot water for engaging in potentially anticompetitive practices that up until now have ensured their advertising partners occupy prime real estate on your devices.\n\nWhat started as a Department of Justice antitrust probe into Google\u2019s online dominance (they\u2019re set to control almost 40 percent of the digital ad market in 2019) has exploded into a collaborative investigation involving attorneys general representing 48 states including Tennessee, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\nWe have an opportunity right now to organically change the way Big Tech does business without impairing investigations of past wrongdoing. I\u2019m sponsoring the BROWSER Act in the Senate in an effort to strike a workable balance between maintaining consumer privacy, and protecting online innovation.\n\nEarlier this month, a smaller coalition of state AGs announced a separate investigation into Facebook\u2019s possible antitrust violations. If you recall, this comes right on the heels of a precedent-setting $5 billion fine the social media giant paid to the Federal Trade Commission following repeated allegations of data mishandling and privacy violations.\n\nThis escalation in interest should feel familiar. In 1998, Microsoft found itself staring down the barrel of a similar regulatory cannon after 20 states joined the Justice Department in a lawsuit alleging predatory and anticompetitive behavior.\n\nAs chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s bipartisan Tech Task Force, I\u2019ve watched Big Tech evolve and extend its reach into the average American's life. Today, we\u2019re surrounded by screens and speakers and operating systems \u2014 everyone seems to want a \u201csmart\u201d home or office. Holding the entities that are placing devices in our homes accountable is just as important as ensuring transparency about what\u2019s being done with the data those devices collect.\n\nTechnology touches our lives in intimate ways and makes us vulnerable to the unintended consequences of surrendering our \u201cvirtual you\u201d to for-profit corporations. Recent data privacy scandals, coupled with these new probes, are proof that the industry is no longer capable of regulating itself.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, Big Tech is not special; but it is different. Protecting consumers from Silicon Valley\u2019s bad behavior will take more than one sweeping antitrust investigation. Think about it: 20 attorneys general participated in the 1998 Microsoft probe; the 2019 equivalent attracted the attention of almost every AG in the nation.\n\nThe American people have voiced their concern \u2014 and you can bet that it wasn\u2019t the prospect of an antitrust sting that prompted the average Tennessean to pick up the phone and reach out to me, and my offices, and other lawmakers across the country.\n\nWe have an opportunity right now to organically change the way Big Tech does business without impairing investigations of past wrongdoing. I\u2019m sponsoring the BROWSER Act in the Senate in an effort to strike a workable balance between maintaining consumer privacy, and protecting online innovation.\n\nChanging privacy practices will inevitably change the way these companies do business\u2014and could even shake up the market. It won\u2019t solve every point of contention in what\u2019s sure to be a protracted investigation into Silicon Valley\u2019s back offices, but it\u2019s a great place to start.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThese are important steps to take, because in today\u2019s environment, when you are online, you are the product. Unfortunately for tech companies, online consumers harbor higher expectations; they enjoy the convenience but they expect to be able to protect their privacy.\n\nThe attorneys general are correct to protect the citizens they represent, and the Senate is correct in addressing these violations. Protecting your right to privacy in the 21st century requires that we hold Big Tech accountable.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.
