He will end up missing 12 games, as well as any playoff games in which they might play.\n\nAD\n\nThe suspension will cost Burfict $879,411.76, or thirteen-seventeenths of his 2019 base salary of $1.15 million. He also will fail to collect roster bonuses reportedly worth $21,875 per game, a total of $262,500 for a dozen games.\n\nBurfict\u2019s representatives argued that the unprecedented punishment was excessive for a football play. The longest previous NFL suspension for an on-field incident was a five-game suspension given to Albert Haynesworth, then with the Tennessee Titans, for stomping on the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Andre Gurode during a 2006 game.\n\nAD\n\nThe NFL, when imposing the suspension, cited Burfict\u2019s status as a repeat offender under the league\u2019s player safety rules. While he was with the Cincinnati Bengals, Burfict was suspended twice for illegal hits and fined repeatedly. In 2017, appeals officer James Thrash reduced the league\u2019s five-game suspension of Burfict for an illegal hit to three games.\n\nAD\n\nBurfict was ejected from the game against the Colts for his hit on Doyle, delivered as Doyle began to get to his feet after going to one knee to make a catch. The league said that Burfict violated the rule, put in place before last season, prohibiting a player from lowering his head and using his helmet to deliver a blow to an opponent.\n\nJon Runyan, the NFL\u2019s vice president of football operations, wrote to Burfict when the suspension was imposed last week that \u201cthere were no mitigating circumstances\u201d surrounding the hit on Doyle, which Runyan wrote \u201cwas unnecessary, flagrant\u201d and avoidable.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nAD", "description": "Burfict will miss the remainder of the Raiders' regular season schedule, as well as any playoff games in which they might appear.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AEvaa-PodNGI5GsUPA--p-CTVn8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IMW6AKHDVAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
