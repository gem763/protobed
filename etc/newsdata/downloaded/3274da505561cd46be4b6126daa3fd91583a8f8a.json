Myer issued a profit downgrade in March 2015 and eventually reported a profit of $77.5 million.\n\nMr Armour said transparency had become critical as companies like WiseTech and iSignthis came under attack over claims of inflated valuations, but the case might have a chilling effect.\n\n\"Justice Beach has accepted investors don't have to individually prove they relied on information, but can rely on general movements in the market,\" Mr Armour said.\n\nThe director lobby group said there should be a review of continuous disclosure laws \u2013 as proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission in January \u2013and that they may need to be relaxed following a surge in claims and sky-rocketing directors and officers' liability insurance.\n\n'Australian directors are more exposed'\n\nThe AICD's latest director index sentiment released on Friday shows that 70 per cent of directors already agree or strongly agree that boards are being too risk-averse.\n\n\"The consequence is boards who are already being very cautious and risk-averse is they will want to say even less and be more conservative about forward-looking statements,\" Mr Armour said.\n\n\"Australian directors are more exposed than any other developed economy because they have fewer protections on forward-looking statements.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AICD said law firm Herbert Smith Freehills had recently advised that Australia was out of step with similar regimes in the US and UK.\n\nMr Armour said they found \"any forward-looking representation to the market is taken to be misleading if the person making the representation does not have reasonable grounds for making the statement\".\n\nAt the same time, that presumption in the law is combined with a lack of a \"safe harbour\" defence for forward-looking statements that is available in the US and Canada.\n\nFreehills partner Jason Betts said there was \u201cgood and bad news\u201d for corporate Australia.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is there was uncertainty as to whether our courts would actually find companies in breach of the continuous disclosure obligations and would they interpret those obligations strictly \u2013 and the courts have for the first time ever said, \u2018we will\u2019.\n\n\u201cI say strictly because Myer was not seeking to guide. The board had not authorised the statement to be given to the market, it wasn\u2019t a formal ASX announcement.\n\n\u201cBut what Justice Beach said is, \u2018I'm not really interested in, in anything other than what a reasonable person would expect you to do. And I don't care that analysts knew better. If your CEO said, \u2018we're going to grow profit in 2015\u2019 and that wasn't true, you had to correct it, even if the market knew better.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe good news, Mr Betts said, was that \u201cwhen it comes to loss, the courts will take a pragmatic and commercial approach, and I will ask the fundamental question: did your breach actually caused loss to shareholders?\u201d\n\nMr Walker, the CEO of litigation funder Investor Claim Partner and president of the chairman of the Association of Litigation Funders, said \u201cthere was not enough loss\u201d in the Myer claim to make it viable. \u201cWe had a look at the figures and they didn\u2019t stack up.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision meant there was no more ambiguity around corporate continuous disclosure laws or market-based causation.\n\n\u201cWe can't go to mediations any more and spend a lot of time and effort and money on arguing both sides of the fence.\u201d\n\nAndrew Watson, the head of Maurice Blackburn\u2019s class actions practice, said Justice Beach had shown that plaintiff claims had been proceeding on the right basis.\n\n\u201cYou can give a forecast which is right at the time it's given because it is based on reasonable grounds. But at a subsequent point in time, you've got to inform the market that you no longer going to make it.\n\n\u201cThat's been clear for a very long time but we've got a judicial stamp on what most corporations would have regarded as good practice and common sense.\u201d", "description": "Boards will \u201cinevitably\u201d become more cautious in issuing profit forecasts after the landmark judgment that found Myer misled the market in late 2014, according to the peak body for company directors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2780e668bea446ae08bf8209b79ef899d1d2ddfc", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
