In fact, Speaker Bercow's refusal to hold a vote today makes very little difference.\n\nThat is because, whatever happened, Boris Johnson would have had to put a full-blown Act of Parliament allowing Brexit through the Commons before October 31.\n\nThat law - the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) - will now enter Parliament tonight and begin debates tomorrow as Boris Johnson tries to rush it through.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nThe PM was ambushed by opponents on Saturday who demanded he ask for an extension to give MPs time to debate all the Brexit legislation - and make sure the UK cannot crash out in the meantime.\n\nMinisters are instead expected to introduce the EU withdrawal bill today, with MPs getting a vote on its crucial second reading tomorrow.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDowning Street believes it has the numbers to get it through.\n\nBut the legislation is expected to be altered by MPs, with Labour tabling an amendment calling for Britain to stay in a customs union with the EU.\n\nThe amendment would directly undermine the PM's deal which seeks to take the UK out of the customs union so it can strike its own trade deals.\n\nThe DUP - whose votes could be crucial - has left open the possibility of backing the amendment although Jim Shannon MP appeared to shoot down those hopes this morning.\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\nShadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer has suggested that Labour would back amendments for a \"confirmatory vote\" on any Brexit deal, although it is unclear whether the numbers are there in the Commons to get it through.\n\nThe EU is prepared to delay Brexit until February if Mr Johnson is unable to get his deal past MPs this week.", "description": "MPs murmured angrily as the Commons Speaker made a bombshell ruling after Boris Johnson tried to re-run a vote on his Brexit deal", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Uk Parliament Afp Via Getty Imag", "Uk Parliament Afp Via Getty Images", "Wpa Pool"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654196.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
