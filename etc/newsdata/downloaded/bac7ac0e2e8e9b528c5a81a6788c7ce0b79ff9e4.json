SDF leaders warned that they will have to transfer the guards and security forces from the prisons to the front lines if a clash with Turkey ignites.\n\nWhile the SDF has U.S. funding for the prisons, as well as behind-the-scenes support from U.S. Special Forces, a White House statement Sunday night suggested that Mr. Trump is eager to go in a different direction.\n\n\u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years,\u201d said the statement, using the acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nAlthough the bulk of the ISIS captives hail from Syria, Iraq and other Middle Eastern nations, Mr. Trump \u2014 at a White House briefing that was supposed to focus on a Japanese trade deal \u2014 again focused on the refusal of European countries to take home their nationals who traveled to the region in support of the ISIS \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\nSenior U.S. counterterrorism officials were trying to contain the fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise move. They argued that it would be a \u201cmisinterpretation\u201d to say the White House invited Turkey to sweep in and militarily take over the Kurdish-run prison camps.\n\nMr. Trump has not ordered a withdrawal of U.S. personnel from the area of northeastern Syria where the prison camps are located, the officials said on background.\n\nHowever, concerns were soaring Monday night that Turkish forces may seize on confusion about the U.S. position to invade the area and target Kurdish militias that Ankara insists are linked to a long-running militant Kurdish separatist movement inside Turkey.\n\n\u201cIf Turkish forces actually move in, the SDF are going to have to make a major decision on whether to go fight the Turks and protect the border around their territory or stay where they are and keep up security around the prisons,\u201d one senior official told The Washington Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely delicate situation, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re extremely concerned about.\u201d\n\nWhile Turkey pondered its options, Mr. Trump appeared to contradict his own White House statement by threatening on Twitter to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d the Turkish economy if Ankara does launch a war to drive Kurdish militias from their posts on the Syrian side of the border.\n\nNational security analysts say the administration badly needs to clarify its plan for the Islamic State prison camps.\n\n\u201cU.S. officials need to have a clear-cut contingency plan lest the security situation devolve to a point these guys get released,\u201d said Bill Roggio, a counterterrorism analyst with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cIf that happens, it would represent a major and really regrettable blow to the gains made against Islamic State over the past four years.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the U.S. shouldn\u2019t disengage until the prisoner issue is dealt with, but the other reality is that it appears the prisoner issue is not being dealt with,\u201d said Mr. Roggio, an editor of the foundation\u2019s Long War Journal.\n\nBuilding frustration\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s push for U.S. allies to take custody of foreign-born Islamic State fighters last made headlines in August, when his frustration on the matter burst into the open on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations in France.\n\nThe president told reporters that the U.S. won\u2019t foot the hefty bill of holding the jihadis at the U.S. detainee center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He said the U.S. might be forced to release detainees back into their homelands if countries such as France and Germany continued to balk at taking them.\n\nAdministration officials have suggested that the number of captured fighters with European Union citizenship is higher than 800, although U.S. counterterrorism officials have declined to comment on the figure.\n\nThe officials say some 2,000 fighters held by the SDF in northeast Syria are a mix of some 50 nationalities, including from North African nations, Gulf Arab states, Russia and Western Europe.\n\nSome countries, including Russia, Sudan and Malaysia, have agreed to take back their nationals, but others have ignored the U.S. calls. Western European nations in particular are wary of political blowback that could come with taking on the cases of prisoners who hold dual citizenship in North African and European Union nations.\n\nLaws in most European countries would hinder convictions without explicit evidence of defendants\u2019 roles as Islamic terrorists. In the absence of legal reforms, the risks are high that fighters returned to Europe could be quickly released.\n\nThe situation is also sticky for Washington. A CBS News reporter gained access to a prison run by the SDF last month and met a number of inmates who claimed to hold U.S. citizenship. While thousands of EU citizens are reported to have traveled to Syria to fight with ISIS during its 2014-2016 heyday, a much smaller number are believed to have traveled from the United States.\n\nSome legal analysts blamed Mr. Trump for adding fuel to an already volatile situation.\n\n\u201cMany of us have long warned that this detention status quo was not sustainable over the long haul because of the risk that SDF forces at some point might not be able to continue to hold the requisite territory or because they might for some reason cease to be willing to administer this detention system themselves,\u201d said Robert Chesney, a national security lawyer at the University of Texas School of Law.\n\n\u201cNow it seems that \u2026 triggering conditions for a collapse of the SDF detention system are looming before us, thanks to President Trump\u2019s precipitous decision to greenlight a Turkish invasion of northern Syria,\u201d Mr. Chesney wrote Monday for Lawfare, a national security blog published with the Brookings Institution.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
