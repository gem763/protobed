It is being replaced by a new Democratic-Socialist Party.\n\nIf you think I exaggerate, consider these examples.\n\nImagine what would have happened if any candidate in the debate had the courage (or lack of sense) to actively defend President Bill Clinton\u2019s policies on welfare reform, capital gains tax cuts and balanced federal budgets, or his 1996 State of the Union assertion that \u201cthe era of Big Government is over.\u201d\n\nRONNA MCDANIEL: FOURTH DEMOCRATIC DEBATE WAS ANOTHER WIN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GOP\n\nImagine that any candidate had agreed with President Barack Obama\u2019s original 2008 position that \u201cI believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\u201d\n\nOr imagine that a candidate had defended ObamaCare as the solution to health care in America.\n\nWhen the last two Democratic presidents can no longer be defended by the men and women hoping to become the next Democratic president, something profound has happened.\n\nWe have already seen the old Democratic Party (and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. James Clyburn of South Caroline literally represent the old Democratic Party) being eclipsed by \u201cthe Squad.\u201d\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is now the spiritual leader of House Democrats. And every major Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed radical Green New Deal-type proposals that would expand government, destroy the energy industry, radically change America, and plunge the economy into a depression.\n\nThe Democratic-Socialist Party wants to outlaw private health insurance, punish the successful (especially the wealthy), and expand government control over virtually everything.\n\nIn 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.\n\nThe Democratic-Socialist candidates embrace policies ranging from wanting to confiscate guns; forcing the radical California gender curriculum on every state; removing the tax exemption for every church, synagogue, and mosque that defines marriage as between a man and a woman; providing free (meaning taxpayer-funded) health care to people living in our country illegally; and opening the border so anyone and everyone will be able to enter the United States without having to worry about immigration laws.\n\nSome of these radical candidates favor tax-paid sex-change operations in prison \u2013 and genderless prisons (one of Biden\u2019s contributions to the dialogue) so male criminals could declare themselves female to be sent to women\u2019s prisons.\n\nImagine that one of the candidates had said he or she was against abortion. The result might have been a riot \u2013 and at a minimum an expulsion of the heretic. Instead, the new Democratic-Socialist Party stands for abortion on the last day of pregnancy, and its most radical acolytes are now for infanticide after delivery as long as \u201cthe infant would be kept comfortable\u201d (see the New York state law endorsed by the Democratic governor of Virginia).\n\nAlmost equally heretical would have been a candidate defending Columbus Day (favored by 57 percent to 29 percent of the public, with the Democratic-Socialists once again in a position favored by about a quarter of the country).\n\nImagine that candidate attacking the National Education Association\u2019s pledge that \u201ceducators must acknowledge the existence of White supremacy culture as a primary root cause of institutional racism, structural racism, and White privilege. ...the Association will actively advocate for social and educational strategies fostering the eradication of institutional racism and White privilege perpetuated by White supremacy culture.\u201d\n\nWhite supremacy culture is left-wing code for American history, American exceptionalism, the rule of law, the Constitution, and the various habits and patterns that made America the most prosperous and powerful nation in history.\n\nCan you imagine one of the candidates in the debate arguing that our schools should not be centers of anti-American indoctrination dictated by left-wing unions? Of course not. They would be booed off the stage.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal put it in an editorial headlined \u201cWarren and Sanders, Policy Mates.\u201d the pattern is overwhelming:\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe editorial says this about Warren and Sanders: \u201cThey both would force these companies to get a new federal charter requiring them to consider \u2018stakeholders\u2019 rather than shareholders in their business decisions. They both want to reimpose the old Glass-Steagall fence between commercial banking and investment banking. 'The business model of Wall Street is fraud,\u2019 Mr. Sanders likes to say. Ms. Warren also thinks bankers are crooks: 'Wall Street is looting the economy.\u2019 They agree the U.S. Postal Service should become a bank that offers government checking accounts and would compete with private banks.\n\n\u201cOn college as an entitlement, the two again see eye to eye. 'It\u2019s time to cancel student debt and make universal free college a reality,\u2019 one says. The other reverses the order: 'We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free, and cancel all student debt.\u2019 For the record, Ms. Warren\u2019s plan is the first one.\u201d\n\nThere are a scattered handful of traditional liberal Democrats in the House and Senate, but none have any chance of ever being a national candidate in the emerging Democratic-Socialist Party.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe are watching a historic moment in which a once-great American political party is transformed into an anti-American engine of radical change. In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.\n\nIt will be a wrenching, defining moment for the party of Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy if it is conquered by the party of AOC, Sanders and Warren.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential candidate debate was one more reminder that we are living through the death of the Democratic Party.
