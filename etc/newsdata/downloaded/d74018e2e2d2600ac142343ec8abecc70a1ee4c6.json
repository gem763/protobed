Nick\u2019s only connection to Garrett was a 12 month relationship with the child\u2019s mother Tandy Cyrus, which became the sole justification for a police investigation that would eventually go on for a further five years.\n\nDuring Who Killed Garrett Phillips? unimaginable horrors unfold as Nick is duped into speaking to police unaware that he\u2019s a suspect, before he\u2019s forced to strip naked and be photographed for a full body examination.\n\nAn entire town were dead set on sending an innocent man down (Picture: Sky Crime)\n\nThen came the witch hunt as \u2018Justice For Garrett\u2019 posters were drawn up on every street corner, but basically read as \u2018Send Nick Hillary down\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the documentary doesn\u2019t shy away from suggesting why.\n\n\u2018Postdam isn\u2019t racist, there\u2019s just not many African-Americans here,\u2019 notes one resident, overlooking Nick\u2019s Jamaican heritage.\n\nTanya\u2019s other ex-partner John Jones \u2013 an officer who also worked on the case and comes under suspicion in the documentary \u2013 faced an alarmingly tamer interrogation, where his \u2018strip search\u2019 involved rolling up his jumper sleeves. His face was also kept out of all photographs rendering the evidence useless.\n\nThe difference in both examinations says it all.\n\nIn turn, while fighting for his freedom, Nick also lost his job, his reputation couldn\u2019t have been beaten any more and while he was eventually found not guilty of Garrett\u2019s murder, he will inevitably face as much of a life sentence, albeit without the bars.\n\nViewers haven\u2019t just been appalled by the findings in Who Killed Garrett Phillips? they\u2019ve called the film \u2018stomach churning\u2019 and \u2018the most uncomfortable watch\u2019.\n\nNick\u2019s life has been ruined by the accusations, but Garrett\u2019s killer was never found and his family are still no closer to the closure they\u2019ve been searching for since his death eight years ago.\n\nPolice have now revealed that, finally, they are investigating new leads.\n\nWho Killed Garrett Phillips? airs on Sky Crime and is available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
