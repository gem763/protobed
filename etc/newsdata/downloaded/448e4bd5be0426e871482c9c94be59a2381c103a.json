It is completely debunked,\u201d said Bossert, who served as homeland security adviser from January 2017 to April 2018. He added that if Trump continues with that focus, \u201cit\u2019s going to bring him down.\u201d\n\nBossert\u2019s comments stood in stark contrast to attempts by Trump\u2019s allies to downplay a scandal that has sparked a formal impeachment inquiry, with the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his senior adviser Stephen Miller both fiercely defending Trump on the Sunday news shows.\n\nBossert singled out Giuliani for pushing the Ukraine conspiracy theory and disparaged the former New York City mayor for repeating it to the president.\n\nGiuliani, who appeared on ABC after Bossert, denied ever supporting the theory, but he doubled down on a connection between Ukraine and Democrats, among other things.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to Tom Bossert, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nThe competing narratives are playing out as information has leaked about Trump\u2019s alleged attempts to undercut political rivals through his State Department, and his reported comments to Russian officials in 2017 that he wasn\u2019t concerned about interference in the previous year\u2019s election.\n\nThree House committee chairmen on Friday subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents related to interactions between Trump, Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They also issued a schedule of depositions for State Department officials named as playing a role in the Ukraine affair, which came to light because of a complaint from an anonymous whistleblower in the intelligence community.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said on Sunday that the impeachment inquiry would focus on \u201cabuse of power,\u201d adding that it could include possible White House failures to comply with congressional subpoenas.\n\nWith the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees moving ahead with their inquiry, Democrats have discussed the possibility of pursuing \u201cobstruction of Congress\u201d as part of potential articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nThe Intelligence chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), has confirmed that the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, will testify in a closed session before his panel at the end of this week. And on Sunday, Schiff said on ABC that he had reached a tentative agreement with the whistleblower and his attorneys to appear before the committee \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is illegal, improper, a violation of oath, a violation of his duty to defend our elections and our Constitution for the president to merely ask for foreign interference in our election,\u201d Schiff told Stephanopoulos.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies, during a private conference call on Sunday afternoon, laid out a strategy for their offensive against Trump, including plans to streamline their messaging operation and help vulnerable lawmakers who face potential repercussions in their districts.\n\nBossert said he was cautious about the impeachment proceedings after seeing \u201ca lot of rush to judgment.\u201d It\u2019s far from proven, he said on Sunday, that Trump did anything to abuse his power and withhold aid to Ukraine in order to solicit its cooperation in an investigation of Biden, the former vice president and a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nThe president issued several tweets and retweets over the weekend attacking Democrats and the impeachment process, and also going after the whistleblower\u2019s credibility.", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s former homeland security chief said on Sunday that he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by his former boss\u2019s attempts to solicit damaging information from Ukraine about Joe Biden, becoming one of the most vocal critics among ex-Trump officials.  \u201cYes, I\u2019m deeply disturbed by it, as well", "authors": ["Rishika Dugyala", "Sarah Cammarata"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/h53qm2P57j0rpj1FohVLAw--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/be5aa6cf9a861e7e4c4dbf81a5f9db94", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
