Local and state authorities have said people will be arrested if they do.\n\nOn Tuesday, two men from the Netherlands were arrested on suspicion of trespassing at a U.S. government reservation where the military conducted bomb tests until 1992.\n\nDeputies said the men told them they wanted to gather and post internet video of Area 51, which is at least 20 miles away.\n\nRoberts\u2019 attorneys on Thursday also demanded from West a list of people who they say bought 2,400 camping tickets.\n\nWest, who was still clearing desert sites this week for campers, has said she\u2019d allow up to eight people per site, raising fears that more than 19,000 people might overwhelm the remote town of about 50 permanent residents.\n\nThe events in Rachel and Las Vegas are not connected with festivities hosted by the owner of an alien-themed business in another tiny Nevada town, Hiko.\n\n\u201cThis event is on,\u201d Alien Research Center owner George Harris said Friday of his \u201cArea 51 Basecamp\u201d plan.\n\nHiko is about a 45-minute drive from Rachel. Both are more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) from Las Vegas.\n\nHarris said he expects at least 4,500 ticket-buyers for his Sept. 20 and 21 festival featuring 60 food trucks and vendors, eight live bands during the day, and speakers and movies after dark.\n\n\u201cThis event is a cultural event,\u201d Harris said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An innkeeper who expects an unknown number of campers to be attracted to her tiny Nevada desert town by a \"Storm Area 51\" internet hoax has been sent a cease-and-desist order over her use of the name \"Alienstock.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Ritter"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/security_site_trespass_charges_80710_c0-155-4869-2993_s1770x1032.jpg?e812a6feaf43f4488e2ec1fde115b5fc1bcb1af0", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
