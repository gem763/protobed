He played five seasons with Atl\u00e9tico.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Spanish soccer federation has given Barcelona what amounts to a token fine of 300 euros ($329) for negotiating with Antoine Griezmann while he was still under contract with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/spain_soccer_la_liga_83819_c0-100-2392-1494_s1770x1032.jpg?2dca27cba0047c721c1c7aa8b84eb64e0fa00110", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
