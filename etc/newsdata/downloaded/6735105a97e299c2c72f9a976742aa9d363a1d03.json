The woman, a 36-year-old acupuncturist who works for a different company located in the building, was taken to a hospital with what were said to be non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBannan, a fifth-round pick by the Buffalo Bills in 2002 who also played for the Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos, St. Louis Rams and Detroit Lions over a 12-year NFL career, was found by police outside the building engaged in a conversation with another man. Per reports, police found two .45-caliber handguns inside a backpack belonging to Bannan, as well as a rolled-up $20 bill coated with a white substance that tested positive for cocaine.\n\nFormer NFL and University of Colorado Boulder lineman Justin Bannan appears in court at the Boulder County Jail on Thursday.

He was said in the affidavit to be \u201csweating profusely\u201d while speaking with police, claimed the shooting was an \u201caccident\u201d and to have declared of the woman, \u201cShe did not deserve that, she was a good person.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Bannan was said to have claimed to police that he suffers from hydrocephalus, a condition in which fluid builds within the brain and can cause pressure in the head. In some cases, hydrocephalus can also impair cognitive skills (per the AANS).\n\nAD\n\nAn attorney for Bannan asked for his client\u2019s bail to be lowered, per reports, citing Bannan\u2019s long involvement with the community and lack of a criminal record. The judge in the case declined, saying that the allegations in the affidavit raised \u201csignificant concerns about the safety of the community.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "According to police in Boulder, where Justin Bannan starred at the University of Colorado, the former defensive lineman told the woman he shot that he was being pursued by the Russian Mafia.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/N8PUCAzoWSyZo284dI2SALtHe80=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KHENZU34M5EO3HYSARSUU3U7RE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
