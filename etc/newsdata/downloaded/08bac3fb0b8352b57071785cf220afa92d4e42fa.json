It was not immediately clear what caused the incident.\n\n\"Due to those two impacts, due to the blunt force trauma, she was pronounced dead on scene,\" CHP Officer Ruben Jones told ABC Sacramento affiliate KXTV.\n\nKurt Rivera/KXTV\n\nShe and seven others were believed to have been skydiving with the Lodi Parachute Center, authorities told the station.\n\nAn employee at the parachute center told ABC News they would be holding a press conference Friday morning, but would not say anything more.\n\nKurt Rivera/KXTV\n\nThe death is the latest to plague the center. In October 2018, Bill Dause, the center's owner, addressed the fatalities connected to his company.\n\n\"We have had a number of fatalities and I don't know the exact number,\" according to KXTV. \"Each one has been totally unique. It's not like we've been doing the same thing wrong all the time, or the same parachute failed, or something like that.\"\n\nDause said he thought up to 18 people have died with his company since 2000, including four suicides, two heart attacks, and a number of other issues causing the deaths.\n\nAll southbound lanes on Highway 99 were closed for about an hour after the latest incident, according to CHP.", "description": "A skydiver died after she crashed into a big rig trailer on a California highway.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/truck-2-skydiver-ht-ps-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
