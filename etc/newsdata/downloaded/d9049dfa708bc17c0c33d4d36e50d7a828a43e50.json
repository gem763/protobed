Vetements has matured into a company that can evolve its creative heritage into a new chapter on its own,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is unclear whether the demands of the increasingly frenetic fashion schedule contributed to Gvasalia\u2019s decision, although he is expected to present Balenciaga\u2019s spring 2020 show in Paris later this month.", "description": "In the middle of Spring 2020 presentations, influential designer announces he is leaving label he co-founded", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbecd62973b49931e2e73737dfc2f1003320dba/0_0_4273_2564/master/4273.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d7ad88f061b9c01a4715b90909e916e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
