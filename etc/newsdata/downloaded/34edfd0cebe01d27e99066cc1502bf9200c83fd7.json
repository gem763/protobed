The salaries from those jobs will average $150,000, according to an agreement with the state and county, and low- and moderate-income people who live in the area fear they will be priced out of their homes. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNearby, Virginia Tech is building a graduate school campus in the Potomac Yard area of Alexandria. Economic development officials expect it and the Amazon headquarters will attract other firms to the region. Hence, the local elected officials hope to get ahead of the flood of growth they are sure is coming \u2014 and they want to act with ungovernmentlike speed.\n\nVirginia Tech chooses site for Innovation Campus\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to this [process] to go on forever,\u201d said Alexandria council member Amy Jackson. \u201cWe do want to be a magnet. We don\u2019t want to be stagnant in our planning.\u201d\n\nA few seats down, Arlington County Board member Katie Cristol agreed.\n\n\u201cWhat keeps me up at night is what happens in the next 18 months,\u201d she said. While Cristol said she had confidence in the county\u2019s ability to address housing, transportation and other problems over the next 10 years, \u201ctelling people we have a long-term plan is not going to do it. What are the temporary measures we can provide?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat question was left unanswered as the all-Democratic boards, under the guidance of a consultant, discussed the policy areas they wanted to manage together. The participants graded themselves \u201cpleased\u201d and \u201cexcited.\u201d\n\nOr as Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson (D) said, \u201cThere\u2019s an intention and willingness to tackle new ways of doing things. . . . Whether we like it or not, we\u2019ve made ourselves a laboratory here.\u201d\n\nArlington, Alexandria split in the 1870s. Could Amazon bring them together?\n\nAbout 100 people attended the joint meeting at the Gunston Community Center, just north of the Arlington-Alexandria border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have been very disappointed if housing affordability was not the top priority,\u201d said Nancy Veldhuis of Alexandria, one of several members of Virginians Organized for Interfaith Community Engagement who attended the event. \u201cThere was all this talk about urgency but as they got toward the end, they said the two Marks would draw up a paper.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201ctwo Marks\u201d are Alexandria City Manager Mark Jinks and Arlington County Manager Mark Schwartz, who agreed to set up a city-county panel to draft the next steps.\n\n\u201cIt sounds very exciting. We have to see what develops,\u201d added Carol Brooke of Arlington, the chair of the local League of Women Voters\u2019 affordable housing committee.\n\nWatching from the back of the room was Paul C. Smedberg, chair of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board and a former Alexandria council member.\n\nWhat would really make a difference, he said, was if the two communities could build bus-only lanes, improve the street management and add bike lanes. They\u2019ve done it before, by cooperating to create a bus-only corridor in the Crystal City to Potomac Yard neighborhood called Metroway. Smedberg called it \u201ca perfect example\u201d of what could be accomplished together.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChuck Bean, executive director of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, was pleased about the meeting, calling it \u201ccollaboration in action.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great what Alexandria and Arlington are doing together,\u201d Bean said. \u201cOther jurisdictions could learn a lot from this approach. It\u2019s pointing in the right direction for the whole metro area.\u201d\n\nCrystal City-Potomac Yard bus transit way underway\n\nNorthern Virginia jurisdictions form alliance to lure companies, jobs\n\nD.C. region\u2019s leaders face big challenges with affordable housing\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Residents say a meeting of the local boards is a positive first step, but want to see action.", "authors": ["Patricia Sullivan", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Other Regional Issues In Arlington County"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IqeO4nIJa58y3jurpfKfwKXq2rw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZMFE5XEY4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
