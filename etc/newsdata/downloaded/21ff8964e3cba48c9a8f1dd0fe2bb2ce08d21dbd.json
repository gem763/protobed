Donald Trump mocks 'emoluments' clause of U.S. Constitution that bans foreign gifts", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump rejected suggestions Monday that hosting the G-7 summit of world leaders at his resort in Doral, Florida, would have run afoul of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the White House Cabinet Room, Trump dismissed as \u201cphony\u201d a section of the Constitution that bars federal office holders from accepting gifts from foreign governments.\n\n\u201cYou people with this phony Emoluments Clause,\u201d he said.\n\nTrumps remarks came as he was chiding Democrats for pushing back against his decision to host the G-7 at his Doral resort.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans, as well as government watchdogs, decried the administration's decision to award the event to one of the president's properties. Under pressure, Trump announced Saturday on Twitter that he was reversing his decision to host the summit at Doral, suggesting Camp David could serve as an alternative site.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaking during a Cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Monday, Oct. 21, 2019, in Washington. More\n\nOn Monday, Trump defended his choice of Doral.\n\n\"I would have given it for nothing,\" he said. \"The Democrats went crazy, even though I would have done it free.\"\n\nA change of plans: Donald Trump pulls his Doral property from consideration for G-7 after bipartisan blowback\n\nTrump also rejected criticism that he would have personally profited from hosting it at his Florida club.\n\n\"I don't need promotion,\" he said. \"It would have been the best G-7 ever.\"\n\nThe Emoluments Clause is an anti-bribery provision that forbids any U.S. president from receiving gifts from foreign leaders and is derived from the Latin word \u201cemolumentum,\u201d meaning \u201cprofit\u201d or \u201cgain.\u201d\n\nThe Emoluments Clause is Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution. It prohibits any \u201cPerson holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States]\u201d from accepting \u201cany present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\u201d\n\nTrump National Doral golf resort in Miami More\n\nSuit dismissed: Federal appeals court rejects Maryland, D.C. lawsuit over President Donald Trump's business\n\nIn July, a three-judge of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a lawsuit from Maryland and the District of Columbia that alleged Trump violated the Emoluments Clause by benefiting from his business while in office. The full appeals court, however, agreed last week to rehear the case.\n\nThe suit challenged the financial benefits Trump has reaped from government entities patronizing his businesses while he is president, pointing in particular to government bookings at his Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House.\n\nTrumps dismissive remarks about the Emoluments Clause drew immediate fire on Twitter.\n\n\"There are two Emoluments Clauses that he's violating and they are very much in the very real Constitution,\" wrote the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nThere are two Emoluments Clauses that he's violating and they are very much in the very real Constitution. https://t.co/Bx2qEx6M6n \u2014 Citizens for Ethics (@CREWcrew) October 21, 2019\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked: \"What other parts of the Constitution does President @realDonaldTrump think are \u2018phony\u2019?
