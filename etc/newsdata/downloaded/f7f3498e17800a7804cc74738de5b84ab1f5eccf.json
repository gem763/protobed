Stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweet drew an immediate condemnation from the Chinese government, while several Chinese businesses and media outlets cut ties or blacklisted the organization.\n\nThe NBA initially responded with a widely-panned Monday statement expressing its regrets to offended Chinese fans, and spurred even more U.S. anger with a stronger statement in Mandarin condemning Morey.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike have accused the NBA and Silver for prioritizing the league\u2019s lucrative presence in China over human rights and free speech.\n\nThe lawmakers wrote that the NBA\u2019s response \u201cnot only sold out an American citizen,\u201d but also \u201creinforces the Chinese Communist Party view that those who point to Chinese repression in Hong Kong are as best stating opinions, not facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cHundreds of millions of people within China will read your statements as an admission that their government\u2019s propaganda is correct,\u201d the lawmakers continued. \u201cThat you have more potential fans in China than in Hong Kong is no excuse for bending over backwards to express \u2018sensitivity\u2019 only to one side.\u201d\n\nWhile Silver on Tuesday pledged to defend the freedom of expression for all NBA players and personnel, the statement did little to appease the NBA\u2019s critics in Washington and Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese government canceled an NBA fan event, along with a media availability with players on the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers, who are scheduled to play games in Shenzhen and Shanghai this week.\n\nChina has also canceled the broadcast of all NBA games, stripped promotional ads for the Nets-Lakers games, and threatened the league with starker penalties for criticizing the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cWe voice our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Adam Silver offering as an excuse the right to freedom of expression,\u201d said state-run China Central Television in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe believe that no comments challenging national sovereignty and social stability fall within the scope of freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nA fan was also ejected from a Tuesday game in Philadelphia between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Chinese Basketball Association\u2019s Guangzhou Loong Lions for shouting \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d from the stands.\n\nSeveral U.S. politicians have also criticized the NBA\u2019s decision to yield to China despite the league\u2019s support for players and coaches who have spoken out against racial disparities within the criminal justice system, LGBTQ rights and other political issues.\n\nThe lawmakers urged Silver on Wednesday to make an explicit statement supporting the rights of NBA employees and fans \u201cto express their opinions no matter the economic consequences,\u201d and urging China to respect the league\u2019s commitment to free speech.\n\nThey also asked the NBA to suspend all activities in China until the country\u2019s government and businesses reverse their boycott, and reconsider the location of a training camp in the Xinjiang region, where the Chinese government has conducted mass oppression and of more than 1 million Uyghur Muslims.\n\n\u201cNBA players have a rich history of speaking out on sensitive topics of social justice and human rights inside the United States, and the NBA takes pride in defending their right to do so,\u201d wrote the lawmakers Wednesday.\n\n\u201cYet while it easy to defend freedom of speech when it costs you nothing, equivocating when profits are at stake is a betrayal of fundamental American values.\u201d", "description": "A bipartisan group of eight lawmakers fiercely criticized the NBA in a Wednesd", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cruzted_ocasiocortezalexandria_061419gn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
