When people are stereotyped and discriminated against because of their weight and size, the numerous negative mental and physical effects include a direct association with the development of eating disorders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnorexia is a condition characterised by persistent restricted food intake, an intense fear of weight gain, and a distorted body image. Despite stereotypically being associated with a very low body weight, these characteristics can also be met in those with a higher BMI.\n\nThe causes are multifactorial so we need to be careful about pointing to a single reason for the results of this latest research.\n\nIt\u2019s also difficult to say whether weight stigma has increased over the last decade but it has been more blatant in the public sphere.\n\nOnly last month American talk show host Bill Maher postulated on TV that fat shaming \u2018needs to make a comeback\u2019, with the likes of Piers Morgan quickly voicing his support the next day. It\u2019s not surprising that we have a society with an intense fear of weight gain when high-profile figures are encouraging that kind of message.\n\nWeight stigma is also associated with disordered eating, a phrase that describes a range of irregular eating behaviours including frequent dieting, preoccupation with food, chronic weight fluctuations and feelings of guilt or shame.\n\nWe use the same language when parenting our children: \u2018You can\u2019t have that, it\u2019s bad for you\u2019 and rarely think twice about the fact this could be harmful.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly common to hear people talk about \u2018bad\u2019 food \u2013 it\u2019s something I used to do myself. When we use moralistic language to describe what we are eating, guilt and shame follow close behind. That guilt then leads to an attempt to undo the action, often with the punishment of exercise or restriction of food. People that resonate with these patterns can be at higher risk of them developing into an eating disorder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe use the same language when parenting our children: \u2018You can\u2019t have that, it\u2019s bad for you\u2019 and rarely think twice about the fact this could be harmful.\n\nA 2016 survey by Mintel found that 48 per cent of UK adults had dieted in the previous year and of those, 64 per cent do so all or most of the time. With one of the criteria for anorexia being persistent restricted food intake, it\u2019s concerning that a third of the population would fall under that umbrella with many not realising how harmful their habits can be.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s so common for persistent dieting to be normalised in adults that these statistics might not have much of an impact on first reading \u2013 but look at similar statistics with children. A review by Common Sense Media in 2015 found that one in four children had actively tried some form of dieting behaviour by the age of seven, and 80 per cent of 10-year-old American girls had dieted.\n\nWhen you consider that dieting is consistently found to be the single largest predictor of eating disorders when occurring in adolescents, those numbers are incredibly scary.\n\nAs a society obsessed with social media, distorted body image is far too commonplace and children are much more sensitive to social evaluations and body comparisons than adults \u2013 all phenomenon that social media use encourages.\n\nBut while it may be partially to blame for body image issues, it doesn\u2019t form the whole picture \u2013 and it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. Discussions around positive body image are becoming more frequent and Instagram is reportedly testing ways to remove like counts from images, which should alleivate pressure from its user base to rack up likes. It\u2019s all movement in the right direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe advice from the medical community is clear: we should avoid weight talk and discourage dieting in children, instead focusing on promoting healthy behaviours.\n\nOur relationship with food is important and we need to start treating it as such. It\u2019s not necessarily that we\u2019ve stopping caring, it\u2019s that we never realised it was something to care about in the first place.\n\nWe need to start talking about this because ignoring harmful behaviours around food that occur three times a day, seven days a week, isn\u2019t a valid option anymore.\n\nIf we are going to start reducing the rates of anorexia, we can\u2019t continue to normalise eating disorder techniques in the pursuit of weight loss and health (I\u2019m looking at you intermittent starving\u2026 sorry \u2018fasting\u2019).\n\nChildren are a product of their environment, and their environment is currently doing them a disservice. Harmful language around food, constant dieting messages, aggressive weight stigma in the public sphere all mean children start imitating the behaviour they see from a very young age.\n\nLet\u2019s stop setting them a bad example.\n\nMORE: Your before and after weight loss photos are fuelling fatphobia\n\nMORE: Please don\u2019t say \u2018anorexic\u2019 when you mean thin.
