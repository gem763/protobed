They are the first German criminal charges against him over the emissions rigging and the first to put him in direct legal jeopardy.\n\nThe former chief is already under indictment in the US but is highly unlikely to face trial there because Germany does not extradite its citizens.\n\nMr Winterkorn resigned as VW chief in 2015 over the dieselgate scandal, in which cars were fitted with software designed to cheat emissions tests.\n\nProsecutors in the city of Braunschweig brought charges against him and four other former VW managers.", "description": "Mr Winterkorn is accused of lying to authorities and offering guarantees that VW was not selling rigged cars 'even after he knew about the illegal manipulations'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2421%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_30%2C$y_7/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ce925229d4a899756897035e496a904992e7f2e3", "published_at": "2019-04-16"}
