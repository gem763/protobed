He's the sixth Texas GOP member of Congress to retire so far ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nAlready, three other House Armed Services Republicans \u2014 Reps. Rob Bishop of Utah, Mike Conaway of Texas and Paul Mitchell of Michigan \u2014 have opted to retire.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Will Hurd \u2014 the only black House Republican \u2014 made waves when he announced his decision not to seek reelection after just three terms.\n\nThornberry's congressional district in the Texas panhandle, home to the Pantex plant that handles nuclear weapons, is among the most conservative in the country and is almost certain to stay in Republican hands in the 2020 election.\n\nThornberry is locked in negotiations with other House and Senate Armed Services leaders over annual defense policy spending that are likely to extend well into the fall.\n\nIn nearly a quarter century on Capitol Hill, Thornberry was widely respected for his national security acumen by lawmakers in both parties.\n\nHis Democratic counterpart, House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith of Washington state, praised Thornberry's work to reform the Pentagon and called his retirement \"a loss for the Congress.\"\n\n\"I have known Mac since I first came to Congress in 1997 and have always been impressed by his intelligence and tenacity. Since then we have worked together on all manner of national security issues as members of the House Armed Services Committee,\" Smith said in a statement. \"Together, we have passed smart reforms that give our men and women in uniform the resources they need to make our country safer.\"\n\nThornberry's retirement announcement will likely trigger a rush to replace him on the committee. He was term-limited from his committee perch in 2021 as the top Armed Services Republican \u2014 or chairman if the GOP retakes the House \u2014 in the next Congress.\n\nRepublican Reps. Mike Turner of Ohio and Mike Rogers of Alabama have long been seen as likely candidates to succeed Thornberry. Other senior Republicans on the committee, such as Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, could also seek the post.\n\nThornberry took over as Armed Services chairman in 2015, becoming the first Texan to lead the committee.\n\nIn four years wielding the gavel, he advocated \u2014 and won \u2014 major increases in the defense budget that pushed military spending well past $700 billion. Total national defense spending for the 2020 fiscal year is set to top out at $738 billion, a historic high in military spending outside the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nHis chairmanship, which coincided with other senior Texans chairing national security committees, arguably marked the pinnacle for the state's influence on defense spending and security issues.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

And he tied a series of deadly aviation accidents, ship collisions and other readiness issues to a lack of steady, predictable funding for the military.\n\nAs Armed Services chairman, reforming the Pentagon\u2019s arcane weapons-buying practices became one of Thornberry\u2019s signature efforts. He criticized the acquisition system as far too slow and rigid to field weapons quickly enough to meet rapidly evolving threats. He also backed provisions aimed at streamlining the acquisitions process in each defense policy bill he spearheaded.\n\nAdditionally, he sought to slash the Pentagon\u2019s support and administrative agencies, commonly known as the Fourth Estate \u2014 a move that drew resistance from Republicans and Democrats who sought to protect defense agencies in their districts.\n\nWhen Democrats retook the House majority in the 2018 midterm wave, Thornberry became the panel\u2019s ranking member. He led all House Republicans in opposing defense policy legislation written by Democrats in July, arguing the bill would have jeopardized military readiness by endorsing a lower level of defense spending, among other contentious provisions.\n\nThornberry was elected to Congress as part of the 1994 Republican Revolution that swept the GOP into the House majority for the first time in four decades. He's one of only two Republicans left in the House who was elected in the 1994 midterm wave; the other is Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio.\n\nPrior to running for office, Thornberry worked on Capitol Hill as an aide to Texas Republican Reps. Tom Loeffler and Larry Combest and in the State Department during the Reagan administration.\n\nThornberry also hails from a longtime ranching family. And when asked on several occasions if he'd run for open Republican leadership posts, his response was usually terse.\n\n\"I'd rather be a vegetarian,\" he said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1e/c5/41a7ebdf42c3996650c1e87f20a8/190930-thornberry-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
