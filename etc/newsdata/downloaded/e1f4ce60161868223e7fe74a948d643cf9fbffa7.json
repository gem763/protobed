Zellweger had hoped to meet Chesney and planned to \u201cpass him a note\u201d during the event. But before she could, the actor and singer\u2019s publicists began talking and Zellweger\u2019s intentions were communicated. \u201cWhen the broadcast wrapped, [Chesney] went over [to Zellweger] and said, \u2018I hear you are trying to pass me a note \u2014 don\u2019t let the principal find out,'\u201d a friend of Zellweger\u2019s told People.\n\nThe pair did a surprisingly good job of keeping their relationship under wraps for months. It wasn\u2019t until late April, when Zellweger came out on stage during Chesney\u2019s concert to give him a margarita and a kiss that their relationship made its way into the public eye.\n\nJust over a week later, the couple surprised the world once more when they wed in an intimate ceremony in the Virgin Islands.\n\nShutterstock More\n\nRELATED: TBT: Ashton Kutcher Called Kabbalah \u201cOne of the Essential Ingredients\u201d in His Marriage to Demi Moore\n\nWhy We Loved Them: Though the relationship itself began and ended within a year, it seems Chesney had harbored something of a crush on Zellweger for quite some time. When asked to name the \u201cthree sexiest people\u201d in 2002, he chose Zellweger (as well as Charlize Theron and Janet Jackson). \u201cHere\u2019s a country girl who\u2019s still down to earth. You never see her coming, then\u2014wham!\u2014there she is. And that makes her really, really sexy,\u201d he told The Tennessean. \u201cPlus she seems like the kind of girl who could fit in and be at home anywhere.\u201d\n\nAnd in addition to being \u201csexy\u201d and \u201cdown to earth,\u201d Chesney also recognized Zellweger\u2019s talent \u2014 he was so stirred by how she delivered her famous line in Jerry McGuire (\u201cYou had me at hello\u201d) that it inspired him to write a song about it: \u201cYou Had Me from Hello.\u201d \u201cWhen Ren\u00e9e Zellweger said that line, I thought, \u2018That could be a great song,\u2019\u201d he told People in 2000.\n\nWhen They Peaked: For a (brief) time, Chesney and Zellweger were blushing newlyweds. The Cinderella Man star went on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno just two weeks after her wedding and gushed about her \u201ccute\u201d beau and meeting his \u201cgreat\u201d family \u2014 which included a man by the name of \u201cUncle Butch.\u201d", "description": "Take a look back at the relationship between Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Kenny Chesney.", "authors": ["Isabel Jones"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bgtejgoq3CWU1K2nqSQJjg--~B/aD0yMzM0O3c9MTU3MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/instyle_846/7ed98e476cda7312e28f2d40b1bf3ccb", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
