Both are Giuliani associates\n\nTrump was asked about the matter a day after two Giuliani associates were indicted in federal court on alleged campaign finance violations.\n\nThe men, both born in former Soviet republics, have assisted Giuliani in pursuit of his theory Biden family corruption.\n\n'Well, I don't know. I haven't spoken to Rudy,' Trump said, when asked about it.\n\n'I spoke to him yesterday briefly. He's a very good attorney, and he has been my attorney\u2014yeah, sure,' Trump responded.\n\nOn Thursday, it was revealed that Trump's team is bringing on former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy as part of his impeachment defense, but Trump said Gowdy would not be able to start immediately due to revolving door rules.\n\nGiuliani told New York magazine he has 'no reason to believe' he's not Trump's attorney. 'I am still his lawyer until he tells me I'm not,' he said.\n\nThe legal drama comes on a day when the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whom Giuliani disparaged, Marie Yovanovitch, testified before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe matter is part of what has become a House impeachment investigation. Giuliani has also spent months probing Hunter Biden's board position on a Ukrainian gas company. Trump in his infamous call with the Ukrainian president asked for a 'favor' and brought up an investigation of former Vice President Biden and his son.\n\nIn one astonishing development, Giuliani was revealed to have dined with the two indicted men, Viktor Parnas and Igor Fruman, hours before they were arrested at Dulles airport with one-way tickets to Europe.\n\nA series of explosive revelations have followed since then, leading Giuliani to go out in repeated cable TV appearances to defend his president and tie his opponents to overseas intrigue.", "description": "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Giuliani should have registered as a foreign agent,\u00a0two anonymous people familiar with the inquiry said.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com", "Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/00/19611274-0-image-a-29_1570835399968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
