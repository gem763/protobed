But there is no exaggeration in his statement Wednesday that: \u201c\u201cOur turnaround is complete, we have delivered all the metrics we set for ourselves. The leadership team is very strong, our strategy is clear and it is delivering. The Tesco (LON: ) brand is stronger and customer satisfaction is the highest it has been for many years.\u201d\n\nWhile the 31% increase in the share price during his reign may not seem extreme, the wonder is that it happened it all, given the competitive environment and the relentless squeeze on U.K. consumer finances from Brexit, which has caused the U.K. to go from the top of the G7 growth league in 2015 to the bottom in 2018. No wonder that chairman John Allen said in the same statement that he accepted the resignation \u201cwith regret\u201d.\n\nAnother aspect of the departure is the relatively smooth succession planning. Lewis is staying around until summer 2020, giving his designated successor Ken Murphy, a veteran of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ), plenty of time to acclimatize.\n\nThat (along with the results and the dividend hike) helps to explain the stock\u2019s 1.8% rise on a day when the is down 1.5% and the rest of Europe is also in the red. The was down 1.2% and the German down 1.1% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT).\n\nIt also means that Lewis will still be at the helm over what is set to be a tumultuous few months for Tesco (LON: ), given the risk of a disorderly \u201cNo-Deal Brexit\u201d at the end of the month or, perhaps, a couple of months later after a General Election. The erection of new border checks at U.K. ports is set to cause acute disruption to supplies of fresh food in particular, according to the British Retail Consortium, which said last month that government claims to the contrary are \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d.\n\n\u201cRetailers will be preparing for Christmas, stretching already limited warehousing capacity, and the U.K. will be importing the majority of its fresh food from the EU, magnifying the impact of border delays,\u201d the BRC said at the time. The Food and Drink Federation also predicts \u201csignificant and adverse changes to product availability, and random shortages\u201d after a No-Deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cI will give the job everything I have until my very last day,\u201d Lewis said, and Tesco (LON: ) shareholders can be thankful for that. For Lewis, there\u2019s the consolation that, whatever chaos Brexit brings, it will all be someone else\u2019s problem before too long.", "description": "StockBeat:  Tesco Saviour Dave Lewis Bows Out - With Perfect Timing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEA9N0QM_L.jpg"}
