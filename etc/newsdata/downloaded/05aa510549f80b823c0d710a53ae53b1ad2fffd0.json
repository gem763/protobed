But if we looked purely at his performance in the previous game, his ankle definitely had an influence on his performance.\n\n\"We just feel a fully fit S'bu and the way S'bu has been performing, if you compare the two, a 70% Cheslin isn\u2019t better than a 100% S'bu.\n\n\"So, it is a blow, but we have full confidence in S'bu, especially with the way he has been playing. He certainly deserves his chance.\"\n\nErasmus added that what the Boks might lose in Kolbe's raw pace, they gain in other areas of Nkosi's game.\n\n\"Cheslin\u2019s top-end speed and agility is probably one of the best in world rugby \u2013 I think he is up there with Shane Williams and (Damian) McKenzie,\" said Erasmus.\n\n\"That is definitely something we will miss.\n\n\"But aerially, S'bu is right up there with what Cheslin and most of the best players in the world can do. And power-wise, S'bu brings something totally different to the party.\n\n\"In certain aspects of the game, we will keep it the same. And then other things, a starter move here and there, with the size we have with S'bu, we will maybe use him a little bit differently. On defence, we might use him a little bit differently.\n\n\"We will play towards his strength. If you just put the two players next to one another, there are different attributes with each player.\"\n\nKick-off on Sunday is at 11:00 (SA time).\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 S'bu Nkosi, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn\n\nWales\n\nTBA", "description": "Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus admits that it is a big blow losing Cheslin Kolbe for Sunday's Rugby World Cup semi-final against Wales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7968/c9345c81bc1043b0b7d0ca538026c004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
