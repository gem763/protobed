(AP) - The Atlanta Falcons mounted a massive second-half comeback, rallying from 17 down to pull within a point of tying Arizona.\n\nAll they needed was an extra point to tie the game and hopefully send it to overtime, possibly pull out a much-needed win.\n\nWhen Matt Bryant\u2019s try sailed wide left with 1:53 left, the Falcons fell flat again, adding another way to lose in a season quickly spiraling away from them.\n\nOf all Atlanta\u2019s 2019 missteps, Sunday\u2019s 34-33 loss to the Cardinals may hurt the worst - and possibly be the final act of coach Dan Quinn\u2019s career with the Falcons.\n\n\u201cYou put everything into it and I told the team, knowing you could get your heart broken,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThat is was happened today.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons, who fell to 1-5 for the first time since 2007, arrived in the desert early, heading straight from last Sunday\u2019s game in Houston to Phoenix for a week of preparation to face the Cardinals (2-3-1).\n\nThe trip was scheduled months ago for what Quinn and his staff hoped would be a bonding experience.\n\nInstead, the Falcons needed to regroup after giving up 53 points and nearly 600 yards of offense in a lopsided road loss to the Texans.\n\nThe extra road prep looked like it was going to pay off early against the Cardinals.\n\nAtlanta opened with a 10-play, 80-yard drive, capped by Matt Ryan\u2019s 9-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Ridley.\n\nThen the Falcons looked like they flew into a desert sandstorm.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s offense shut down until a late drive set up Bryant\u2019s 29-yard field goal.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s defense had no answer for Kyler Murray and the Cardinals, allowing Arizona\u2019s rookie quarterback to pick them apart.\n\nMurray hit 16 of 19 passes for 240 yards in the first half and hit Chase Edmonds on a 2-yard TD pass. David Johnson also scored on a 1-yard run to give the Cardinals a 20-10 halftime lead.\n\nThe Falcons\u2019 fate seemed to be set when Maxx Williams caught a 20-yard TD pass from Murray to put Arizona up 17 early in the third quarter.\n\nFacing a second straight blowout, the Falcons got their flow going again.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s defense forced Arizona into three straight three-and-outs and the offense found the rhythm it had been missing since the game\u2019s opening drive.\n\nRyan hit Deonta Freeman on a 7-yard touchdown pass late in the third quarter and Austin Hooper on a 6-yard score in the fourth to tie the game at 27-all.\n\n\u201cWe just ran what we\u2019ve been running all week,\u201d said Ridley, who had six catches for 48 yards. \u201cIt clicked and we started moving the ball.\u201d\n\nEven Arizona went back ahead on Murray\u2019s 14-yard touchdown pass to Johnson, the Falcons had an answer.\n\nWorking the ball quickly down the field, Ryan led Atlanta on a seven-play, 75-yard drive capped by a 12-yard scoring pass to Freeman.\n\nThinking the extra point was a foregone conclusion, Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury didn\u2019t look up; he was too busy setting up how the Cardinals were going to answer after the Falcons tied it.\n\nHe should have watched.\n\nThe 44-year-old Bryant, the franchise scoring leader playing his last season, pulled the kick left, leaving the Falcons one point short.\n\n\u201cI have gotten a lot of support, but it doesn\u2019t take away from the feelings of being dependent on doing my job and coming up short,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for us to fight back the way we fought back and not finish it off.\u201d\n\nArizona still had to secure one more first down to keep the Falcons from getting the ball back, but even then, it would have been a long-shot comeback attempt.\n\nWhen Murray slipped just past the first-down marker, Atlanta\u2019s destiny of yet another loss was sealed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons mounted a massive second-half comeback, rallying from 17 down to pull within a point of tying Arizona.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/falcons_cardinals_football_45413_c0-105-2513-1570_s1200x700.jpg?1e43bcd7fdfc1aef2dd120392a56c661f55f7fcc", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
