There were no reference points with which to compare an object so dense that light cannot escape its warped gravity. So he devised his own little analogy: Imagine a waterfall, and a little fish accidentally swimming over its edge, too slow to swim against the water\u2019s flow. The fish would forever be stuck at the bottom of the waterfall, never to return to its home. That\u2019s basically what was happening to the light.\n\n\u201cThe universe isn\u2019t a waterfall flowing over a lip, and a black hole is different in other aspects, but in some aspects they\u2019re very similar.\u201d\n\nA few years later, Unruh was teaching a physics class on the behaviour of fluids, and realised the mathematics of this analogy painted a picture even more similar to a black hole than he\u2019d previously considered. Perhaps analogs, smaller experiments that obey a similar set of physical rules to the black holes, would mimic other fantastical physical effects found in black holes as well.\n\nFor decades, Unruh flushed out the ideas in theory only, and by the time he was a professor himself, he and his postdocs realised they could make the idea a reality. They could build a black hole-like object in their lab.\n\nA photo of Weinfurtner\u2019s rotating black hole experiment. (Image: The University of Nottingham)\n\nScientists since the 1980s have designed, and more recently constructed, a slew of black hole analogs that attempt to recreate the weirdness of spacetime predicted by scientists like Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. Just this year, a team led by physicist Jeff Steinhauer at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology discovered the strongest evidence yet of the radiation that Hawking predicted would emanate from black holes\u2019 outer rims using one such analogue, for example. But the comparison between the analogue and the real universe can only go so far.\n\n\u201cThe universe isn\u2019t a waterfall flowing over a lip, and a black hole is different in other aspects, but in some aspects they\u2019re very similar,\u201d said Unruh, now a professor at the University of British Columbia. But how far? Is the similarity strong enough that studying the analogues can bolster theories about black hole behaviour? \u201cI would say yes,\u201d Unruh told Gizmodo.\n\nEinstein\u2019s theory of general relativity predicts the existence of black holes, objects whose gravity warps space and time so much that beyond a boundary called the event horizon, light can\u2019t escape. But these boundaries are a strain on physicists\u2019 theories, since they obey both the laws of the tiniest particles, quantum mechanics, and the laws of general relativity and its description of gravity\u2014and as of today, there is no proven seamless way to tie these two theories together. Theorists have devised a few physical phenomena that might occur in these extreme regions, including Hawking radiation, the idea that tiny fluctuations of energy caused by quantum mechanics on the black hole\u2019s surface can cause black holes to emit particles, and the Penrose process, by which spinning black holes might inject energy into nearby particles.\n\nBut black hole-observing experiments like the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors and the Event Horizon Telescope certainly can\u2019t resolve event horizons all the way down to the teeny quantum scale. The Large Hadron Collider, the world\u2019s largest atom smasher, has yet to produce a miniature black hole\u2014yes, physicists are looking for them, but no, mini black holes would not cause any harm and would disintegrate almost immediately. To create them, the Large Hadron Collider would probably need beams containing far more energy than its present capabilities. Analogs using ultra-cold atoms, lasers, or even flowing water could at least verify that certain theorised processes exist in nature in objects that act like black holes.\n\nIn the decades after Hawking debuted his theory of black hole radiation, Unruh used mathematics to expand the analogies and develop the concept of \u201cdumb holes,\u201d so called because they would trap sound rather than light. Other physicists built on the theory and devised dumb holes of their own. By the 2000s, Unruh and his team, joined by University of British Columbia civil engineers, were ready to construct dumb holes in the lab.\n\nThe vacuum chamber from Jeff Steinhauer\u2019s experiment. (Photo: Technion - Israel Institute of Technology)\n\nThese first black hole analogs looked a lot more like waterfalls than interstellar points-of-no-return. As a postdoctoral researcher under Unruh at the University of British Columbia, Silkie Weinfurtner oversaw pumps moving water down a flume and across a barrier representing the black hole. The scientists initially hoped to send vibrations, also known as sound, through the water, but the speed of sound in water is 1,500 meters per second\u2014a difficult speed to study in a small lab experiment, Weinfurtner told Gizmodo. Instead, they sent physical waves, like waves you\u2019d see in the ocean, across the barrier.\n\nThe team published their first results in 2010. When the waves they produced interacted with the barrier, they created pairs of waves on either side of the barrier, similar to the pairs of particles that Hawking predicted would appear on either side of the event horizon, inside and outside of the black hole. Hawking and Unruh\u2019s other theoretical work together implies that black holes emit a \u201cthermal\u201d or \u201cblackbody\u201d spectrum of wavelengths based solely on their temperatures, which for black holes is directly related to their mass. The waves from Weinfurtner\u2019s flume generated a strikingly similar spectrum, and the team claimed to have measured \u201cstimulated\u201d Hawking emission in their analogue system.\n\n\u201cBlack hole radiation is one of the perhaps most peculiar processes,\u201d Weinfurtner told Gizmodo. Thanks to her experiment, \u201cyou can reproduce this process in the lab.\u201d\n\nMore complex dumb holes followed; Weinfurtner eventually went on to lead her own group, now at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, which devised a black hole analogue from a vortex produced by a draining, rotating fluid. The vortex amplified waves travelling over the liquid that bounced into it, and the experiment became a first observation of a process called superradiance in the lab\u2014an analogy to the Penrose process, where spinning black holes turbocharge the particles in the space around them.\n\nThe \u201crelentless,\u201d \u201cperfectionist\u201d physicist dropped everything and pursued sonic black holes full time, alone.\n\nIn the past decade or so, scientists have produced a variety of analogs based on similar concepts. Laser light, when it travels through a glass whose properties have been temporarily altered to change the speed light travels through it, also generates Hawking radiation-like light particles. But these analogs still lacked some of the quantum features that would govern Hawking radiation in real black holes. Unruh explained that these systems simply run too hot to observe tiny effects that occur at just a small fraction of a degree above absolute zero, the temperature at which things have no heat.\n\nWhen Unruh first considered observing these quantum effects in an analogue system, he didn\u2019t think it was possible to access the required cold temperatures. But when he told this to a conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico two decades ago, physicist Mark Raizen told him that nearly cold enough temperatures could already be accessed in laboratory systems called Bose-Einstein condensates. And this year, Steinhauer at the Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology may have spotted these quantum effects in one of the most black hole-like analogs yet.\n\nSteinhauer told Gizmodo he\u2019d long been studying Bose-Einstein condensates, ultra-cold collections of atoms that demonstrate quantum mechanical effects on nearly macroscopic scales. He\u2019d heard about the possibility of creating sound wave-based black holes using Bose-Einstein condensates and began working on them as a side project. Once he figured out a way to actually build one of these systems, the \u201crelentless,\u201d \u201cperfectionist\u201d physicist dropped everything and pursued sonic black holes full time, alone.\n\nSteinhauer\u2019s system is similar, in concept, to water flowing over a boundary. A small, tube-shaped region tens of micrometres across contains thousands of rubidium atoms trapped by a laser. An additional laser creates an energy difference\u2014the boundary\u2014that moves through the atoms to act as the waterfall; data is recorded from the point of view of the boundary where the atoms are flowing over it. Imagine how a cliff somehow moving backward through a river would look as much like a waterfall as a river flowing over a stationary cliff. Sound travels at two different speeds on either side of the boundary, from the boundary\u2019s perspective: quickly on top, since the atoms are denser and slower-moving, and slowly on the bottom, where the atoms are less dense and faster-moving. Phonons, the tiniest units of sound, can travel in either direction on top, since the speed of sound is slower than the speed the atoms are moving. On the other side (the bottom of the waterfall), the atoms are moving faster than a sound wave could travel through them\u2014a phonon could never return to the boundary and would be stuck in the sonic black hole.\n\nSteinhauer presented results in 2014 and 2016, demonstrating hints of the spooky quantum correlations between corresponding phonons. This past summer, now joined by postdoc Juan Ram\u00f3n Mu\u00f1oz de Nova and students Katrine Golubkov and Victor I. Kolobov, Steinhauer published the result of the experiment with 21 improvements and ran over 7,400 times. A thermal spectrum, the black hole-like emission whose wavelengths were based solely on the system\u2019s analogue to gravity, appeared in the data, spontaneously, solely as a result of the system setup without any sound wave-generating inputs, the way Hawking envisioned, Steinhauer told Gizmodo. They could even extract the analogue to the \u201cHawking temperature,\u201d the temperature that would determine the nature of the Hawking radiation in a real black hole.\n\nToday, scientists have systems that mimic the laws of black hole physics in their labs. They hope to continue recreating theorised black hole peculiarities in these systems. But without the ability to confirm that real-life black holes actually act this way, what\u2019s the use?\n\nPerhaps most importantly, these analogs tell theorists that their work isn\u2019t entirely off-base, Unruh said. \u201cThis phenomenon has turned out to be so ubiquitous. It occurs in so many varied situations.\u201d\n\nSome of these scientists are just as interested in using black holes to study flowing fluids and cold atoms as they are the reverse. \u201cThere\u2019s much to be learned to understand these small fluctuations in fluids and superfluids when they\u2019re driven to the edge,\u201d said Weinfurtner.\n\nThe mathematics behind the theories that appear to govern the distant universe occasionally crop up in highly engineered lab conditions using strange metals or cold atoms.\n\nBut some question how close the analogs get to real black holes. \u201cIt is widely debated if the analogs can tell us something about the cosmos,\u201d Daniele Faccio, professor in Quantum Technologies at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, told Gizmodo. Faccio works on his own black hole analogs and agrees that they demonstrate the mathematics behind the theories are correct. \u201cHowever, my personal opinion is that they cannot tell us if real black holes also emit Hawking radiation or obey the exact same behaviour that we see in the lab.\u201d\n\nThese conversations go far beyond just black hole physics. The mathematics behind the theories that appear to govern the distant universe occasionally crop up in highly engineered lab conditions using strange metals or cold atoms. Some scientists have even devised experiments to mimic the Big Bang using Bose-Einstein condensates. One day, perhaps these laboratory experiments will actually reveal a new behaviour that then can be seen in space.\n\n\u201cRight now, a lot of the analogies have been sort of cute, proof-of-principle experiments showing that we can do these procedures in our laboratories,\u201d Gretchen Campbell, adjunct professor and co-director of the Joint Quantum Institute of the University of Maryland, told Gizmodo. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if we can ever provide new insight into the universe.\u201d\n\nBut black holes aren\u2019t waterfalls. It\u2019s impossible to say whether our technology will ever allow us to understand the nature of real black holes. As for whether the behaviours of fluids, beams of light, and cold atoms in the lab give you faith in Hawking\u2019s calculations because of the similar-looking maths that governs their behaviour, that\u2019s up to you. \u201cI would say yes, it does give me more faith,\u201d Unruh said, \u201cbut it\u2019s something that almost every scientist would have to answer for themselves.\u201d", "description": "Nearly 50 years ago\u2014before Interstellar, A Brief History of Time, and certainly the Event Horizon Telescope\u2014postdoctoral researcher William Unruh was attempting to explain black holes to a crowd at an Oxford University colloquium.
