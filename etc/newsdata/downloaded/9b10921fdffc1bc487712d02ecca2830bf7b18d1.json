The only way the area could support the frog is if the private property owners make major and costly changes to the property\u2014changes they have said they have no inclination to make nor can they be forced to make.\n\nAs the Pacific Legal Foundation\u2019s Mark Miller, who represented the property owners, recently stated, \u201cThe feds may as well have labeled this Louisiana property critical habitat for a polar bear. It would have done just as much good.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, in 2016, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the government\u2019s actions were permissible. The implications of allowing such an area to be designated \u201ccritical habitat\u201d would be sweeping. Judge Priscilla Owen in her dissent argued:\n\nIf the Endangered Species Act permitted the actions taken by the government in this case, then vast portions of the United States could be designated as \u2018critical habitat\u2019 because it is theoretically possible, even if not probable, that land could be modified to sustain the introduction or reintroduction of an endangered species.\n\nIn a unanimous 2018 decision (Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate), the Supreme Court rejected the 5th Circuit\u2019s opinion, but didn\u2019t actually answer the question about whether the area was \u201ccritical habitat.\u201d Instead, it sent the case back to the 5th Circuit for its review, consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion.\n\nThis included ensuring that the area is \u201chabitat\u201d for the dusky gopher frog before getting into whether it is \u201ccritical habitat,\u201d and reviewing whether the federal government\u2019s failure to exclude the area as \u201ccritical habitat\u201d was permissible. The Supreme Court held that such exclusions are subject to judicial review.\n\nFor the property owners in Louisiana, though, the issue was still very much alive.\n\nBut last week, maybe because the \u201cwriting was on the wall,\u201d the Fish and Wildlife Service and the property owners settled the case, with the federal government dropping its efforts to designate the land as critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog.\n\nThis entire saga provides yet another example of how the Endangered Species Act and its implementation fail to conserve species while simultaneously hurting property owners.\n\nThe federal government wasted resources and attention to achieve an outcome that never would have helped the dusky gopher frog because the habitat wasn\u2019t suitable for its survival. This entire misguided attack on property rights certainly appears more about restricting development than conserving the dusky gopher frog.\n\nAfter 45 years, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that lessons have been learned regarding how to modernize and improve the Endangered Species Act and its implementation. Those lessons should be applied, not rejected, in order to save every word of a flawed statute and every misguided interpretation of the law.\n\nThis dusky gopher frog saga should serve as one of these important lessons.", "description": "Last week saw a major\u00a0victory\u00a0for property rights and an end to another Endangered Species Act horror story.\u00a0\n\nThe saga began in 2012 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that 1,544 acres of land in Louisiana was \u201ccritical habitat\u201d for an endangered species known as the dusky gopher frog.", "authors": ["Daren Bakst", "Senior Research Fellow In Agricultural Policy", "Bakst Studies", "Writes About Agricultural", "Environmental Policy", "Property Rights", "Among Other Issues."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-07/GettyImages-970562566.jpg?itok=wkAnEcwQ"}
