In 53 cases the referee was the victim. These are alarming numbers. Action is needed, and a clear sign to stop.\u201d\n\nThe refs are receiving support from league leader Sparta Lichtenberg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time someone bangs their fist on the table,\u201d Lichtenberg president Werner Natalis told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper. \u201cLately I\u2019ve seen again and again how referees are abused and almost physically attacked.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear if Sunday\u2019s 11th round of games would go ahead. Clubs had the option of agreeing on impartial officials from within their own ranks.\n\n\u201cIn any case,\u201d BFV spokesman Ralf Kisting said, \u201cwe won\u2019t be making any referees available.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Soccer referees in Berlin are going on strike because of ongoing violence at games.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
