On Tuesday, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, is expected to testify; and on Wednesday, Laura Cooper, who oversees Ukraine- and Russia-related issues at the Pentagon, is slated to appear.\n\nTaylor has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry, which is examining whether President Donald Trump abused his office by asking Ukraine\u2019s leaders to investigate his political opponents, and whether those probes were tied to military aid to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress.\n\nIn a series of text messages provided to impeachment investigators, Taylor wrote: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nCooper, a career government official, is likely to have knowledge about the decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine \u2014 funding viewed as critical for defending itself against Russian aggression to its east.\n\nPhilip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, was also scheduled to testify on Wednesday, but a source close to him told POLITICO that his deposition was delayed at the committees\u2019 request, citing memorial services for Cummings.\n\nIn addition to Reeker, three other officials\u2019 depositions were put on hold: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the director for European affairs at the National Security Council; Suriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv; and Tim Morrison, the Russia chief on the National Security Council.\n\nMeanwhile, some Trump administration officials are still refusing to cooperate.\n\nTrump\u2019s acting budget chief said earlier Monday that he would not testify, citing what he called a \u201csham process.\u201d His declaration follows that of other executive branch departments and agencies, which have similarly decried the impeachment inquiry as illegitimate.\n\nRuss Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, also wrote on Twitter that Michael Duffey \u2014 the OMB political appointee tasked with managing a freeze on $400 million in foreign assistance to Ukraine last summer \u2014 would not appear for his deposition, either.\n\nVought joins other Trump administration officials who are stonewalling requests from House Democrats as part of an inquiry into whether the president used the aid as leverage over Ukraine for political favors.\n\nVought also rejected a House subpoena last week for details about the administration\u2019s decision to withhold the assistance, including a detailed timeline.\n\nBut despite the White House\u2019s efforts to block compliance with subpoenas and other requests related to the impeachment inquiry, several current and former officials have appeared for depositions in defiance of the administration \u2014 many of whom have offered evidence that Democrats say is critical for their investigation.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5f/a9/1c734e8a48ef963c116c690477aa/20191021-adam-schiff-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
