Federal judges would also have to post their financial reports, recusal decisions and private speeches.\n\nIt would prevent companies from putting arbitration clauses in employee contracts for employment, which forces individuals to agree to never file a lawsuit in federal court against the company.\n\nWorth noting: These are only some of the top-line proposals from Warren's lengthy plan.\n\nWhat they're saying: Warren said the plan's goal is \"to take power away from the wealthy and the well-connected in Washington and put it back where it belongs \u2014 in the hands of the people.\"\n\nBetween the lines: Warren believes the rest of her far-reaching legislative goals like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All hinge on her anti-corruption plan.\n\nYes, but: \"There are some unresolved questions on the legality of Warren\u2019s plan to ban all fundraising activities for lobbyists given recent Supreme Court rulings on campaign finance and free speech,\" per Politico.\n\nWhat's next: Warren will give a speech in New York City's Washington Square Park at 7pm ET to discuss the plan \u2014 near the site of 1911's Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "The wide-ranging proposal would dramatically restructure the federal government.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/dB_RAhfyP4mx9CCULG1ex_cy4ww=/0x0:5000x2813/1920x1080/2019/09/16/1568639119510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
