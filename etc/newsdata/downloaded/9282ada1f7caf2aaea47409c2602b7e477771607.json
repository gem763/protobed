The Republican state senator from Warren County is a West Point grad who served in an artillery battery in Germany during the Cold War. That gave him time to think of what would happen if those tactical nukes were fired in anger.\n\nAnd that in turn made him side with candidate Trump when he Tweeted things like \u201cSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won\u2019t, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth - $ trillion.\u201d\n\nDoherty texted that to me the other day, followed by a recent Trump quote:\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe we know the target and are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of the attack and under what terms we would proceed.\u201d\n\nWhen I gave him a call, Doherty said that tweet represents the opposite of everything Trump promised during the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to let Saudi Arabia dictate when we go to war?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s contrary to everything in \u2018America first.\u2019 What happened to Trump?\u201d\n\nWhat happened was that he got kidnapped by the same inside-the-Beltway foreign policy establishment that he ran against in 2016. That crowd somehow managed to convince him that it is the proper role of the U.S. military to protect against the threat posed by Yemen.\n\nOne problem: There is no threat from Yemen, at least to the U.S. It\u2019s a poor, crowded country on Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern border where a bunch of mountain people called the Houthis are engaged in a civil war against the Saudi-backed government, which of course is corrupt and inefficient.\n\nSucking up to the Saudis: 'America first' is finishing last with Trump | Mulshine Donald Trump camaigned on an 'America-first' policy and promised to get us out of endless wars in the Mideast; but last week he took sides in what could be another Hundred Years' War\n\nThe Saudis have been bombing the hell out of the Houthis - with American logistical help - since way back in the Obama administration. So it is hardly surprising that the Yemenis would strike back at Saudi Arabia\u2019s weakest point.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not surprising to Bob Baer, the former CIA agent who spent most of his career in the Mideast. In 2003, he authored a book titled, \u201cSleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude.\u201d\n\nWhen I gave Baer a call, the first thing he said was \u201cRead the first chapter of my book.\u201d\n\nI dug out my dog-eared copy. Sure enough, the book began with a scenario envisioning in great detail an attack on Abqaig, the Saudi oil-processing facility blown up the other day in that aerial attack for which the Yemenis claimed credit.\n\n\u201cTaking down Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure is like spearing fish in a barrel,\u201d Baer wrote back then. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of opportunity; it\u2019s a question of how good your bang men are and what you give them to work with.\u201d\n\nAfter the book came out, the Saudi government reached out to Baer to say he was wrong about the vulnerability of Abqaig. He found their arguments unpersuasive.\n\n\u201cI knew this was going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just killing Yemenis right and left. We\u2019re always surprised when these Third World countries snap back at us.\u201d\n\nNow that Yemen has snapped back at the Saudis, Baer said, the sheiks have to be worried about the many other weak points in their oil infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIf they couldn\u2019t catch these 10 drones coming in, what makes you think they\u2019ll catch 10 more?\u201d he asked.\n\nBaer says the simple solution is \u201cJust stay out of the Mideast. It\u2019s like sticking your (slang term for a male organ) into a wasp\u2019s nest.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the sort of thing Trump might have said back when he was campaigning. Doherty said the president needs to keep those promises.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna lose a lot of support if he gets us into a war,\u201d said Doherty.\u201dIf he thinks this is gonna get him re-elected, he\u2019s mistaken.\u201d\n\nHe is indeed. The same liberal internationalist/neoconservatives who called him an isolationist for wanting to stay out of war will call him a hawk for wanting to get into a war.\n\nPresident Trump needs to go back and read candidate Trump\u2019s foreign policy statements.\n\nThat guy was onto something.", "description": "", "authors": ["Paul Mulshine", "Pmulshine Starledger.Com", "Star-Ledger Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/YK8YwW2__wWmlojAE20huKefynI=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UAR6J6R4WNEEPMWJJKC3KTUMSA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
