He stalled by saying he didn\u2019t have any words. His voice cracked with emotion, a familiar sound, and that\u2019s when it hit him. That\u2019s when his mother\u2019s voice popped into his head.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say this,\u201d Martinez started. \u201cOften bumpy roads lead to beautiful places.\u201d\n\nA packed ballpark approved with a booming cheer. Yet they couldn\u2019t have known, in that moment, how hard Martinez tries to believe that. It wasn\u2019t always easy, no matter how many times Lillian Martinez told her son that phrase, and no matter how many times he told it to himself. When he was a kid growing up in Manhattan, mimicking Roberto Clemente\u2019s swing, melting hours into his father\u2019s baseball cards, Martinez couldn\u2019t process a mom\u2019s wisdom. He is part Puerto Rican, learned Spanish from a doting grandmother, and spent hours dreaming of Clemente and the major leagues. Then whenever he slumped in a 16-year career \u2014 and he did slump \u2014 Martinez thought he\u2019d never make contact again. He lost sleep over failure. He got lost in his head.\n\nBut when the Nationals sunk to 19-31 in mid-May, and their World Series odds were dwindled close to zero, Martinez was older. Wiser. Ready to treat cliche as fact.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe heard the calls for his job but never read the stories. He had a health scare in September, and feared for his life, but rejoined the club before doctors had cleared him. Ask the Nationals how they arrived in the thick of autumn, a title chance in hand, and there is a common thread: the 55-year-old Martinez never panicked when many managers would have.\n\nThen they found a beautiful place.\n\nBased on personal experience\n\nRewind to a month ago, to a calm afternoon in mid-September, when Martinez could walk through Washington\u2019s Union Station without attracting a crowd. It was two days before his heart tightened in the Nationals Park dugout, leading to a rush to the hospital and a cardiac catheterization that revealed no further issues. It was weeks before the Nationals advanced to the World Series, and had another champagne celebration, and Martinez stepped right into history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere in the train station, amid the bustle of commuters and commerce, was just an autograph session in front of the D.C. Lottery store. Martinez wore glasses instead of contacts. The Nationals\u2019 flight from Minnesota had landed at 5 a.m. He got only a few winks of sleep. His team had a slimming lead in the wild-card race, with two teams closing, but Martinez wasn\u2019t worried. There would been time for doubt. This wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\u201cYo, Davey, what\u2019s up with next season?\u201d asked a young fan while pressing a photo of Martinez to the table. \u201cY\u2019all going to be all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext season?\u201d Martinez shot back, twisting his face, before using a black Sharpie to scribble his signature. \u201cWe have a game later, man! Then we\u2019re going to the playoffs. But first, we have to go 1-0 against the Braves tonight.\u201d\n\nWhen the Nationals were at their worst, stumbling through spring, stuck in fourth place, that\u2019s what Martinez had to say: We have to go 1-0 tomorrow. It could be maddening to hear, especially after tough losses, when it seemed like nothing was going to turn around. But he stuck to it. He looked into television cameras, his eyes narrowed, and promised better results: \u201cWe\u2019ll come back and go 1-0.\u201d He sat in his office with General Manager Mike Rizzo and promised the same. If he walked through the clubhouse, a space he leaves to his veterans, it\u2019s what the players heard.\n\nMaybe he mixed in a few curse words. Maybe his temper spiked behind closed doors. There\u2019s a still a player in there somewhere, still a hypercompetitive drive, but Martinez doesn\u2019t have a public face. His message doesn\u2019t change when the audience shrinks. Tell his players that\u2019s impossible and they push back.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe manages like you\u2019d expect an experienced player to,\u201d right fielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re hitting every day, pitching, whatever, you can\u2019t let any one thing eat you up. You\u2019ll go crazy. You\u2019ll burn out. Davey lived that and, as a result, we have such a relaxed environment. That starts with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you start to hear the rumblings about your manager getting fired, it\u2019s hard to ignore,\u201d closer Sean Doolittle said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy to say that we played for Davey earlier this season. We played to keep him in this room.\u201d\n\nMartinez doesn\u2019t like calling mandatory team meetings. He learned that from Bobby Cox, his final manager before he retired in 2002, and made it his approach. He held one in Milwaukee as the Nationals were swept by the Brewers in early May. He gave everyone a chance to say what they thought was wrong, one by one, and it became a model the team used moving forward. It helped them come together when the year was spiraling downward in New York. Martinez only had to sit back and watch that gathering unfold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe otherwise prefers private conversations if a player is struggling. When young guys aren\u2019t hitting \u2014 such as rookie Carter Kieboom in April, or Victor Robles as the year wore on \u2014 Martinez told them he hit .139 in his first season. He was just 21 then, a skinny outfielder for the Chicago Cubs, and so often let the game into his head.\n\nHe played for nine teams in 16 seasons, prided himself on his defense, was the sort of journeyman who makes a good coach. He remembers often sneaking away from the ballpark with a bat in his bag, declining dinner invitations from teammates, rushing back to his room for a night of work.\n\nTravel wasn\u2019t like it is now, wasn\u2019t so luxurious, wasn\u2019t always big hotel suites and a ton of space. But Martinez had a routine. He\u2019d ask the medical staff for a roll of tape \u2014 fibbing a minor injury \u2014 and used it to clump his socks into makeshift baseballs. Then he flipped his mattress against the wall, screwed the top off the hotel lamp, and had himself a tee. He\u2019d take hundreds of light swings, tuning his timing, bouncing the socks off the mattress and all over the floor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne time he was so frustrated that he took a full cut and shattered the base of the lamp into pieces. He called his father, Ernie, and asked what to do. The front desk didn\u2019t believe that he was a frustrated ballplayer. They just told him not to worry, as if that were possible, and to get a little sleep.\n\n\u201cEveryone keeps asking me why I didn\u2019t blow up on these guys, why I didn\u2019t get upset, why I didn\u2019t think about getting fired when a lot of people thought I should be,\u201d Martinez said in late September. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019ve lived this. I\u2019ve lived it so many times.\u201d\n\n\u2018They cured my heart\u2019\n\nThen he was in the back of an ambulance on Sept. 15, connected to all those machines, wondering if he maybe cared too much.\n\nA lot crossed his mind on the ride to the emergency room. He wondered if stress caused the pain. He thought about his children, his family and how he didn\u2019t want to let them all down. He thought about his team, in the guts of a pennant race, and how he hated to miss even one pitch. But, for once, he had to think about himself. His heart was telling him to slow down. Doctors would instruct him to stay away from coffee, and alcohol, and maybe try to sit more during games. Yet when they told him not to fly, for at least a few more days, Martinez went to Miami anyway.\n\n\u201cThese guys back here, they cured my heart,\u201d Martinez said on the victory stand Tuesday night, nodding to his club after they swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series, not letting the crowd or cameras keep him from tearing up. \u201cMy heart feels great right now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe soon left the stage and walked onto a packed field. Reporters converged. He took pictures with fans and friends and people he had never met. And when he found a sliver of space, for the shortest of moments, Martinez drew a long breath and looked around. The fans weren\u2019t leaving the stands. His players were hugging their wives, holding their kids, hoping against hope that the Nationals could win four more games. All they ever needed was a chance. He rubbed his graying beard and grinned.\n\nThis is what his mother was talking about all those years ago. This was why panicking never crossed his mind.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "In May, Dave Martinez's job as Nationals manager was in doubt.
