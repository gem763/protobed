Hopes rose last night that an accord was within sight.\n\nFailure to strike an agreement this week would plunge the U.K.\u2019s divorce from the EU back into chaos. Johnson has said he would rather rip the country out of the bloc on time on Oct. 31 without a deal than delay exit day again.\n\nWill U.K. Parliament Back a Boris Johnson Brexit? We Do the Math\n\nKey Developments:\n\nDUP issues statement saying it can\u2019t back the deal \u201cas things stand\u201dThe pound fell as much as 0.6% on the DUP announcementSummit of EU leaders due to begin in Brussels ThursdayAngela Merkel: ready for emergency summit if neededEuro-skeptic Tories say they want to support the agreement but need detailAll times below are CET\n\nGrieve: Don\u2019t Rush Deal Through Parliament (9:30 a.m.)\n\nFormer U.K. Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who was expelled from the Parliamentary Conservative Party for opposing Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy, warned the prime minister against trying to rush any deal through the House of Commons on Saturday.\n\n\u201cAt the moment I haven\u2019t even seen the text of it,\u2019\u2019 Grieve told Sky News. He warned Johnson against trying to avoid parliament scrutinizing the detail of the deal. \u201cWe may be getting to a better conclusion but if they start to rush it again we will end up in a mess and I\u2019m not prepared to let that happen.\"\n\nMerkel: Emergency Summit May Be Needed (9:15 a.m.)\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said there had been \u201csignificant movement\u2019\u2019 in Brexit talks in recent days, and applauded Johnson\u2019s \u201creadiness to negotiate\u201d with concrete proposals. But a deal is not yet done, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a better path than we were, but \u2013 let me say this morning very clearly \u2013 we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Merkel told lawmakers in Germany\u2019s Bundestag early Thursday. She declined to predict how the two-day gathering of EU leaders in Brussels would end \u2013 and suggested an extra summit could be held to push a Brexit deal through, \u201cif necessary.\u201d\n\nMerkel said it must remain \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that no hard border can be erected between the Irish Republic and the U.K.: \u201cWe won\u2019t allow violence to flare up with a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u201d\n\nPound Falls as Deal Still in Doubt (9:08 a.m.)\n\nThe pound slumped in early morning trading in London as the DUP issued their statement rejecting the deal, falling 0.5% to $1.2773. The currency has been whipsawed with every headline this week and touched a five-month high Wednesday on optimism the Brexit talks may be headed for a late-night resolution.\n\nU.K. Says Problems Need Fixing in Brussels (8:42 a.m.)\n\nPrivately, British officials sounded cautious about the chances of a deal. One official said hurdles still existed, and needed to be resolved in the negotiating room in Brussels.\n\nThat contradicts the suggestion that a draft deal had been all-but written by Wednesday night, when EU officials were hopeful that an agreement was close.\n\nMinister: U.K. Hopes for Deal But Work Remains (8:20 a.m.)\n\nU.K. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said efforts are continuing to find a breakthrough after the DUP said it is unable to support Boris Johnson\u2019s latest proposals for a deal.\n\n\u201cWe remain cautiously optimistic that a deal can be struck, though there\u2019s clearly a lot of work to be done,\u201d Jenrick told Sky News. \u201cThe commitment of the prime minister is absolute. The prime minister, his cabinet and his team are going to continue working as hard as they can.\u201d\n\nTalks will continue with the DUP and in Brussels \u201cto see whether there\u2019s a way through,\u2019\u2019 Jenrick said.\n\nDUP Says No to Draft Plan for Deal (7:49 a.m.)\n\nThe chances of a swift Brexit deal received another blow early Thursday. Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which helps prop up Boris Johnson\u2019s minority Conservative government in London, said \u201cas things stand\u201d it will not back the draft agreement. As ever, the key hurdle is how to resolve the future arrangements for the Irish border.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Northern Irish allies are warning they will not support his proposed Brexit deal, putting chances of an agreement in fresh doubt.Despite the progress made between European Union and U.K. negotiators in Brussels on Wednesday, the Democratic Unionist Party", "authors": ["Tim Ross", "Patrick Donahue"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N8GnPTl1fW0MxZFtGXX_rQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ffc1a19f631a6ca706ec1111c384ce50", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
