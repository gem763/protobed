Taraji P. Henson, Zoe Kazan, Susan Kelechi Watson, Mandy Moore and Marisa Tomei all showed up to the Emmys in two-tone looks of pink and red that stood out on the awards\u2019 purple carpet.\n\nThe dual tones were the strongest trend among the women on Sunday night, where outfits from Zendaya, Gwendoline Christie and current red carpet darling Billy Porter also turned heads.\n\nWhile it\u2019s common to see many stars wearing a certain color, the combination of pink and red was particularly eye popping on the Emmys purple carpet.\n\n\u201cWith many also showcasing \u201880s hints of bold shoulders, it shows an emerging optimism on the red carpet and a willingness to have a little fun with fashion,\u201d said Kerry Pieri, the fashion and features director for HarpersBazaar.com.\n\nHenson\u2019s French tulle gown with a sheer red cape was custom Vera Wang Collection. Kazan\u2019s black, magenta and pink silk gown with bow detail was Gucci. Badgley Mischka created Kelechi Watson\u2019s version, in ruby crepe with blush pink sleeves that fell off the shoulder. Moore wore Brandon Maxwell, a pink twill gazar blouse with a red crepe cummerbund skirt.\n\nCorsets, too, had a wow moment. Indya Moore wore white Louis Vuitton and Zendaya rocked Vera Wang in green with a daring top.\n\n\u201cBoth also had slits up to there, making this the current approach to something sexy. Maybe it means we\u2019re all finally ready to move on from the naked dress,\u201d Pieri said.\n\nPieri considered Christie\u2019s intensely \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Bordeaux cape look a near miss. While costume-y, she said, \u201ccelebrating the end of a major epic fantasy drama sometimes calls for gilded robes.\u201d\n\nChristie was Brienne of Tarth on the popular, defunct HBO series, which won top honors for best drama at the ceremony.\n\nMarielle Bobo, fashion director for Essence, said seafoam was another shade du jour - on Regina King, Brittany Snow, Jameela Jamil and Padma Lakshmi.\n\n\u201cThey stunned in the soft pastel hue which complements a variety of skin tones,\u201d Bobo said, also noting the red and pink parade that made for an \u201cunexpected yet refreshing combination.\u201d\n\nThere were some classic Hollywood metallic moments as well, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus in sequined gold and Rachel Brosnahan in navy blue, the latter offering a \u201cmodern take on Hollywood glam with architectural accents,\u201d Bobo said.\n\nLaura Linney, Chrissy Metz, Niecy Nash, Dominique Jackson and Patricia Clarkson embraced heavily sequined looks.\n\nKerry Washington, Angela Bassett and Amy Poehler all opted for pants, while Porter, who has made headlines with his red-carpet gowns, chose sparkling stripe trousers from Michael Kors and a huge statement hat with a towering brim on one side by Stephen Jones. Porter ended up making history later as the first openly gay man to win an Emmy for best actor in a drama series for his role of Pray Tell on FX\u2019s \u201cPose.\u201d\n\nMisa Hylton, an MCM global creative partner and designer, was among the fans of Ava DuVernay\u2019s custom Reem Acra tulle gown that screamed princess in Champagne gold crystals and sequin embroidery.\n\n\u201cIt was so stunning,\u201d she said. \u201cAbsolutely gorgeous. She looked really elegant and beautiful. I\u2019m not used to her dressed up in that way. She definitely wowed.\u201d\n\nAlso on her best-dressed list was Jamil. It was called mint by the designer, Monique Lhuillier. It had a pleated ball skirt with a single-sleeve bandeau top. She wore it with a bright orange lip and matching polish on her nails.\n\n\u201cShe looked like a princess but she was very modern. I loved the bangs and her long hair,\u201d Hylton said. \u201cI love color and I love unexpected.\u201d\n\nAmong her misses: Greta Lee in an iridescent pistachio green puff midriff top with a full skirt. She made use of her look\u2019s pockets on the purple carpet.\n\n\u201cI see maybe where she was going, but I didn\u2019t think it looked good on her,\u201d Hylton said. \u201cMaybe if it was black it would have been a more classic look.\u201d\n\nHylton was underwhelmed for a good half of the carpet.\n\n\u201cI was bored,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the men, the brown tuxedos were just drab.\u201d\n\nBut Jonathan Evans, style director for Esquire, praised men in brown like Dan Levy and others who changed things up. He also included \u201cBrett Gelman with his rusty shawl collar tux and Kit Harington\u2019s conspicuous air tie.\u201d\n\nBobo counted Zendaya among her carpet wins.\n\n\u201cIt gave me flashbacks to her Met Gala Disney moment,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this time she served Poison Ivy realness with strawberry tresses to complement her green number.\u201d\n\nShe also heralded Bassett, in a custom crimson look from Antonio Grimaldi, with sculptural neckline and dramatic cape detail to her top. Bobo said the actress \u201ccontinues to make waves on the red carpet.\u201d\n\nBut her top moment was Emma Lee wearing Christopher John Rogers, a top and skirt look from his spring-summer 2020 collection.\n\n\u201cThis was a major win for designers of color, who rarely make it to the grand stage at these sort of events,\u201d Bobo said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Did someone send a memo?
