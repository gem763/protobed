But there is much more doubt about how it would benefit businesses and employees.\u2019\n\nThe report was published as it emerged two of Mr Corbyn\u2019s closest allies were at war over whether to back an early election.\n\nKarie Murphy, Mr Corbyn\u2019s new elections chief, wants a poll, and is at odds with Mr McDonnell, who wants to press for a second referendum.\n\nMeanwhile, rebel Labour MPs who want to bring Mr Corbyn down have set up a WhatsApp messaging group called \u2018Clause One\u2019 \u2013 a reference to the party constitution\u2019s opening commitment to be a \u2018political Labour Party\u2019 in Parliament.\n\nThey want to block moves to install hard-Left candidates in the Commons and force Mr Corbyn to quit, The Mail on Sunday reported.", "description": "Lord Mandelson (pictured) fires a broadside at Labour's 'statist' economic policies.
