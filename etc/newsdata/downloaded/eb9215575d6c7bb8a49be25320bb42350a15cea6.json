In March, Scentre, which owns Westfield malls in Australia, priced \u20ac500 million in the European market.\n\nEarlier this month, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, the global malls giant that took over Westfield last year, priced a \u20ac750 million bond offering, with a long 12-year maturity and a 0.875 per cent fixed coupon.\n\nThe Vicinity 10-year notes were issued with a 1.125 per cent coupon. More than 50 accounts participated in the final book, wooed by the strength of Vicinity\u2019s single-A credit rating.\n\nGrant Kelley\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the strong response that we received for this inaugural euro-denominated medium-term note raising, which has resulted in highly competitive pricing for our notes,\" managing director Grant Kelley said.", "description": "Vicinity's move is the latest in a run of major debt raisings by retail landlords.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3272%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_212%2C$y_47/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/df1356cdb886ef0fa15052e37155f8bc04423651", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
