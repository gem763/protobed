The address comes after a bumper week of budget votes from Cabinet ministers last week, including Mantashe's own in the mineral resources portfolio.\n\nHis remarks also come after concern from energy expert, Chris Yelland, that he would push for more coal power in the integrated resource plan (IRP), thus undermining any opportunity for renewables to have any opportunity to have sufficient traction.\n\nMantashe told the committee that the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy was still on course to gazette the IRP within the next month and a half.\n\n\"We, as the department, are working at breakneck speed to finalise the IRP by September. It is a summary of what we must do and gives a framework to our approach in energy. We can't lobby for any technology over the other. Our preoccupation is energy supply security,\" said Mantashe.\n\nMantashe said the IRP needed to include as many forms of energy as possible if it were to make South Africa\u2019s energy supply resilient.\n\n\"Inside the IRP, you will get coal, nuclear, gas, petroleum, renewables, wind, water, all of them are there. One of the most reckless things we have done which we must correct quickly is that we don't account for these after they have reached the end of their life cycle,\" Mantashe said.\n\nHe said Koeberg nuclear power station comes to the end of its life in 2024, after which its life would be extended by 20 years.\n\n\"We have not asked what we do in the space of nuclear beyond the extension of Koeberg's life. Many stations and facilities come to the end of their life in the coming years but we don't talk about how to maintain their capacity,\" he said.", "description": "Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe told Parliament that the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy was still on course to conclude the Integrated Resource Plan by September.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7631/5fb92420a3804ab6b128e540105abdfd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-16"}
