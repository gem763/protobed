Players that were inside the game saw a flurry of falling asteroids, which destroyed the game \u2013 they then fell into a black hole, which replaced the entire universe of the game.\n\nNow, that's all players can see if they try and play. And it's all Epic will say about it, too, since it deleted its social channels and replaced them with a live stream of the black hole.\n\nCan I play Fortnite now?\n\nNo. Anyone trying to will be greeted with the black hole.\n\nThere is, seemingly, no way around this \u2013 no trick to get back into Season 10 or play an older version of the game. Since the battle royale part of the game (and the story mode, too) rely on network features, Epic is able to change or destroy the game whenever it wants and there is no way for players to stop it happening.\n\nFortnite does include a minigame, however, if you wish to do something in the game. If you open up the black hole and do the Konami Code, a minigame will pop up \u2013 though it isn't anything like Fortnite.\n\nThere are of course a variety of other battle royale games in which you can get your fix \u2013 and some of them, like Apex Legends, are free. So those could be a good way to get your fix while you wait.\n\nBut ultimately there is no real way around the outage. Fortnite is down until Epic makes it come back.\n\nIs Fortnite going to come back?\n\nIt is almost certainly going to come back. There are a variety of clues, but the ultimate evidence is outside the game: Epic makes vast amounts of money from Fortnite, and it would be very unusual for developers to throw it all away.\n\nThat means that after all of this will presumably come Season 11, or whatever Epic chooses to name the next installment of the game.\n\nBut we don't know when, how, or with what changes. It may come back in an entirely different form \u2013 perhaps, for instance, with a completely different map.\n\nAre there any clues about what will happen next?\n\nEpic has started to offer hints. But it's not clear what exactly they mean, or whether they mean anything at all.\n\nThe most meaningful one is the fact that, occasionally, numbers come out of the black hole.\n\nPlayers found that the first of those numbers, when put into Google Maps, sent players to a huge gathering of crustaceans on a beach \u2013 that is, a crab rave, just like the meme. That suggests the numbers could be a largely meaningless joke meant to frustrate users.\n\nNew numbers have also started coming out: in addition to the crab numbers (11, 146, 15, and 62), the game is also spewing forth others (87, 14, 106, 2, and 150). The signifiance of those \u2013 whether they are more co-ordinates, or if all of the numbers will eventually form into one big clue \u2013 is still a mystery.", "description": "Fortnite, after being hit by an asteroid, has disappeared and been replaced by a huge black hole.
