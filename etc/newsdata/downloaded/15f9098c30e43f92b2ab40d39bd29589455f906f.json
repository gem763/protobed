He (Solskjaer) has brought in three players but he probably needs seven or eight (altogether).\n\n\"But you can't do that over one transfer window, so you have to be patient because it will be slow.\n\n\"The culture has changed and what he is trying to do was much needed. He needs time.\"\n\nThe pressure mounted on Solskjaer following the loss to Newcastle, and the Norwegian boss apologised to supporters after the match for the manner of the defeat.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI say sorry to the fans that we are not winning games,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to get results, get momentum I can't give you what I acceptable. Every game at this club should be a win game.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise our game and raise our supporters mood with Liverpool next.\n\n\u201cConfidence is a big thing. Performance and results give you confidence. When there is a decision to make they don't do it instinctively. It effects everyone.\n\n\u201cWe are unhappy with the result. That brings out the mood of everyone. That is down to us starting a rebuild. We are going through a very difficult period.\"", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side lost 1-0 to Newcastle on Sunday to leave them in 12th place in the Premier League", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20526099.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
