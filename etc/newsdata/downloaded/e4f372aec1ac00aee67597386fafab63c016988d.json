The Supreme Court is set to hold a hearing next month \u2014 with a ruling expected by June \u2014 on the consequential blockbuster case that would inform and shape public policy for the next decade.", "description": "Two federal judges blocked his move to add the question to the 2020 census", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ZOnDX_EH0KBC3waAwJaiVCpSssw=/0x415:4977x3215/1920x1080/2019/03/14/1552572456004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-14"}
