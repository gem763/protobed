Surely they\u2019re entitled to certain information about external threats that\u2019s in our possession as part of that partnership. Note the bit in the excerpt, though, about how their access to our intel on Kurdish positions has now been discontinued.\n\nIf we\u2019re entitled to withhold that information now, why didn\u2019t we withhold it before the attack began?\n\nThe United States military, which had been working with the Syrian Democratic Forces to fight remnants of the Islamic State in Syria, has cut off all support to the militia, two American military officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential military assessments. The officials said the United States was not providing support to Turkey either, but for the last few weeks, as Turkish military officials planned the assault, they received American surveillance video and information from reconnaissance aircraft. The information may have helped them track Kurdish positions. Because of an American counterterrorism partnership with Turkey, Turkish aircraft were given access to a suite of American battlefield intelligence in northeast Syria. Turkey was removed from the intelligence-sharing program only on Monday, a Defense Department official said.\n\nDid we give any intelligence on Turkish positions to the Kurds? They\u2019ve spent the past few days begging Trump to create a no-fly zone against Turkey on the border. Not only is the United States not going to do that, it turns out we\u2019ve essentially scouted Kurdish targets for the Turkish air force.\n\nTrump could take the position in all this that the United States must necessarily remain neutral in a war between two allies. That\u2019s not the argument he\u2019s been hammering, preferring instead to frame his redeployment of U.S. troops in northern Syria as part of his program to end endless wars \u2014 even though this redeployment is facilitating a new war which might require a major new American redeployment to deal with an invigorated ISIS in the aftermath. But he could take that view. If he does, though, how will he explain sharing intelligence with only one side? Clearly we weren\u2019t neutral. We aided Turkey.\n\nSome American soldiers are heartsick about the betrayal:\n\n\u201cI am ashamed for the first time in my career,\u201d said the distraught soldier, who has been involved in the training of indigenous forces on multiple continents. The hardened service member is among the 1,000 or so U.S. troops who remain in Syria. \u201cTurkey is not doing what it agreed to. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d the military source on the ground said. \u201cWe met every single security agreement. The Kurds met every single agreement [with the Turks]. There was no threat to the Turks \u2014 none \u2014 from this side of the border.\u201d\u2026 The American troops are doing \u201cnothing,\u201d the source lamented. \u201cJust sitting by and watching it unfold.\u201d\n\nThe commander of the SDF claims that there have already been two prison riots by ISIS fighters at camps guarded by the Kurds since Turkish operations began. Guards remain in position for now but that will change as military necessity dictates. For his part, Erdogan expressed his own deep commitment to his partnership with NATO allies today by threatening to send millions of Syrian refugees to Europe if Europeans give him any flack about pummeling the Kurds.\n\nA fun sidenote to a grim story is news today that Lindsey Graham apparently got pranked by a pair of Russians in early August when one of them called him up pretending to be Turkey\u2019s defense minister. Graham, ever obsequious, assured the \u201cminister\u201d that he recognized that Turkey has a \u201cKurdish problem\u201d and that the Kurds are a \u201cthreat,\u201d language that strongly contradicts the ardently pro-Kurdish message he\u2019s been pushing the last few days. The interesting part is that this two-month-old call is leaking only now. There\u2019s speculation that the Russian pranksters are actually connected to the Kremlin, which might have been seeking to punish Graham for his Kurdish support by leaking this and embarrassing. Some call it a prank, others might call it \u201ckompromat.\u201d\n\nIn any case, Graham has made his Kurdish sympathies abundantly clear in the last 24 hours, tweeting out a draft proposal of U.S. sanctions on Turkey stemming from its anti-Kurdish initiative. I\u2019m eager to see how that does on a floor vote and, if it somehow ends up passing with veto-proof majorities, how Graham himself will react if Trump decides not to implement the sanctions for fear of destroying the U.S.-Turkish alliance. That would pit Graham\u2019s two core political identities against each other \u2014 ardent hawk vs. Trump sycophant.
