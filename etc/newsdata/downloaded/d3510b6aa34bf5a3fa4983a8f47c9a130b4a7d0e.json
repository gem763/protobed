If you take a large scale ERP that's 10 years old and has no upgrade path, it's fine if we just keep putting lipstick over this pig then. Eventually, it will no longer be a pig and it will just evolve into some new contemporary platform, won't it?\" Dunn joked.\n\n\"And so managing expectations for me is an incredible challenge.\"\n\nDunn said it's important to recognise that at some point, there needs to be a modernisation of core platforms spread across the organisation. He said senior leadership needs to understand exactly why something needs to change.\n\n\"Attempting to try and manage expectations of senior leaders about, one, just how challenging that is; and two, if all that we do now is change the technology for a different pig, then we're still going to have a pig on the other side,\" he said.\n\n\"The best outcome is to not even look at the system, but to rather sort of look at those processes and systems -- our reasons for being in business and why are we here, what's the outcome that we've looked to try and achieve -- that is absolutely critical.\n\nSee also: Special report: Digital transformation: A CXO's guide (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\n\"Before we begin the journey to look at what might be an appropriate enabling piece of technology to support the journey that the organisation needs to go on.\"\n\nSPECIAL REPORT Digital Transformation: A CXO's Guide You can download all of the articles in this special report in one PDF (free registration required).

He discussed taking a new approach to digital leadership, noting that ownership by the executive leadership team and an understanding that a digital transformation affects the entire business is important to its success.\n\n\"It's not just a new piece of technology, but rather it's actually a full transformation of the service delivery element,\" he said.\n\n\"Technical debt is absolutely real ... the stuff of yesterday is the problem.\n\n\"We need to be upfront about that but recognise there are different approaches that we can take now on the business and it really is about doing some of that journey-mapping work before you start to look at systems, and that can be very difficult and confronting, particularly for business leaders who are quite convinced that [we] just need a faster course.\"\n\nThe department has touted that it's remit will deliver services that benefit Queenslanders and supporting government service delivery.\n\nIt looks after housing, homelessness, and sport; building policy and asset management; as well as digital technology and services for the state and is responsible for the Queensland government Chief Information Office.\n\nAsha Barbaschow travelled to Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo as a guest of Gartner.\n\nMORE FROM QUEENSLAND", "description": "The department's CTO said the hardest part of replacing ageing systems is managing expectations of the business.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/10/28/a6f5612d-8f37-40d4-a25f-643268dc31ce/thumbnail/770x578/36e9ebecc6aa00bf918e3eb35ad05cfa/old-computers-inesby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
