Their liquidity and asset quality going into this weakening operating environment caused by the protests \" and to some extent the trade issues have affected Hong Kong as well,\" Long said at a media briefing on Tuesday. \"We'll see worsening asset quality and weaker profits, but still very resilient in terms of the entire banking system.\"\n\nProtests and unrest over 19 straight weekends have cut into retail sales, discouraged people from eating out and caused a severe drop in tourists in August, the worst monthly decline since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003.\n\nStephen Long, managing director for global banking at Moody's, says that Hong Kong banks have a strong balance sheet.

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said she would formally withdraw the bill in September, but that has done little to dissuade demonstrators.\n\nAlready weakened by a trade war that has weighed on global trade and future business investment, Hong Kong's economy shrunk by a much worse than expected 0.4 per cent in the second quarter. In August, the city's government lowered its forecast for gross domestic product growth to zero to 1 per cent for the year. Several economists have said that they believe the city's economy could contract this year.\n\n\"The Hong Kong economy is facing stiffer growth headwinds amid continued instability and risks have tilted to our bear-case scenario,\" Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists Helen Qiao and Miao Ouyang said in a research note on Tuesday. \"Although the government has announced stimulus packages to support the economy, a recession in [second half of 2019] seems unavoidable.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it would cut a countercyclical capital buffer \" requirement that banks set aside a certain amount of capital in good times and still be able to engage in lending during downturns \" by 50 basis points to 2 per cent, the first reduction since 2015. The HKMA estimates the move would allow banks to inject as much as HK$300 billion (US$38 billion) back into the financial system.", "description": "Hong Kong's banks are likely to remain \"resilient\" even as pressure mounts on their earnings amid one of the city's worst political crises and the 15-month-long US-China trade war weighs on the economy, according to Moody's Investors Services.Stephen Long, managing director for", "authors": ["Chad Bray Chadwick.Bray Scmp.Com"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5MXWbaDFPpCT9qOgBzVORA--~B/aD01NDg7dz05NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_us_228/9929d03388abeb3afc76117928eb35c8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
