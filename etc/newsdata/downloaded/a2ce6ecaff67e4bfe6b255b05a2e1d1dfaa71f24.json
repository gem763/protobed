Savage is another word. But the one that often comes to my mind is cowardly.\u201d\n\nThe judge also added that Martinez Estrella had previously \u201cshown little remorse,\u201d and despite being emotional Friday in the courtroom, the judge said: \u201cIt rings a little hollow this late in the game.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Five Found Guilty of Dragging 15-Year-Old Boy From Bronx Store, Stabbing Him to Death With Machete\n\nDuring the attack, the five suspects followed Guzman-Feliz into the Cruz and Chiky bodega in Belmont and grabbed him as he struggled.

I\u2019m not sure about that because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m hearing about it \u2026 you threw your future in the garbage.\u201d\n\nGuzman-Feliz\u2019s parents were also present in court Friday, both of whom still struggle with the loss of their child every day.\n\n\u201cHere I am, a mother without my son\u2026an innocent, 15-year-old boy who was not a gang member who roamed the streets with bad intentions,\u201d Leandra Feliz, Lesandro\u2019s mother, said. \u201cThese criminals ripped him away from me leaving all his family and school friends.\u201d\n\nLisandro Guzman, the teenager\u2019s father, added that the gang members \u201cdeserved to be punished to the fullest extent of the law. You deserved to be punished for causing so much pain. You are the poster children for danger to society.\u201d\n\nGuzman-Feliz had aspirations of becoming a policeman and had enrolled in the N.Y.C.
