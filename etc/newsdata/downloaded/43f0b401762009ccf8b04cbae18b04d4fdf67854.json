Usually that takes a little bit of time,\u201d Woods told the PGA tour website.\n\n\u201cBut this golf course is a little bit on the softer side. I\u2019ve been able to strike my irons pretty well this week so far and that\u2019s been nice.\n\n\u201cI left a lot of my approach shots below the hole and I was able to be pretty aggressive, and the greens are a little bit slower than they were yesterday.\n\n\u201cI had a good feel on the putting green, which was nice. Hit a lot of putts from below the hole and making sure that I put a lot of right hand into it and released it and it felt good all day.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Tiger Woods holds a two-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Zozo Championship as he targets a record-equalling 82nd PGA Tour title.
