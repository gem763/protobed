(AP) - Aubree Davis ventured to the place everyone knows they need to go but no one ever actually wants to: outside her comfort zone.\n\nHer first roller derby scrimmage ripped her out of that zone. It threw her on the ground, too.\n\n\u201cI was blocking, and I got laid out by a veteran,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI deserved to be laid out. She got me two or three times. I got super worked up. I started jamming - which means I went from defense to offense - and I was doing really well.\n\n\u201cAll that adrenaline poured through me and I stopped. I just started bawling \u2026 it was such a rush of every emotion, all that hard work and surviving that first experience and knowing I was unscathed and I was frustrated. I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.\u2019\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go home angry. I went home like, \u2018OK, so I\u2019m a crier.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe former Army soldier recently graduated from the Panhandle United Roller Derby league\u2019s 12-week boot camp and is preparing for her first bout with the home team, the Beach Brawl Sk8r Dolls.\n\nThey call her Killamity Jane.\n\nRoller derby has revealed the inner athlete in Davis and many other women across the region. And they don\u2019t intend to let the sport go unnoticed.\n\nFundamentals\n\nIt\u2019s a Thursday night practice for the Panhandle United Roller Derby at Fort Sk8 Family Fun Center in Fort Walton Beach.\n\nThe league has two teams: the home team, the Beach Brawl Sk8r Dolls, and the all-star team, Panhandle United All-Star Unicorns. It ranks 169th out of 349 leagues worldwide through the Women\u2019s Flat Track Derby Association - though no one would be expected to know that.\n\nAll eyes darted when a referee fell and his helmet bounced - as one skater put it - like a basketball on the concrete floor.\n\nNo irony was lost. A sport was being played without a ball in sight.\n\nVeteran player Monica Heimes explained.\n\n\u201cRoller derby is kind of like football on skates - without the ball,\u201d Heimes said. \u201cWell, we have a ball. That is called our jammer. Our jammer will wear a star on her helmet.\u201d\n\nIt takes a second to register that, yes, the ball is a person.\n\nEach team fields four blockers and a jammer. The blockers\u2019 job is to stop the jammer from getting through, Heimes said. The jammer battles through the blockers to complete an opening lap and then scores points by passing rival blockers.\n\nAnd that\u2019s roller derby, summed up.\n\nBut it\u2019s not even close to all there is to the sport or their league.\n\n\u2018Derby girl\u2019\n\nIn the Panhandle United Roller Derby league, there are real estate agents, doctors, dental hygienists and other professionals ages 18 to late 40s. Heimes teaches a Voluntary Prekindergarten Education Program.\n\n\u201cThere you\u2019re telling kids, \u2018Don\u2019t hit each other. Keep your hands to yourself.\u2019 Here you\u2019re laying big hits, taking out women, feeling empowering,\u201d Heimes said. \u201cThe word empowerment is a big thing for us \u2026 it\u2019s being able to do something different than your everyday life.\u201d\n\nWhen Heimes skates, she isn\u2019t a teacher. She\u2019s Michi-Gangster - her roller derby persona - a combination of her Michigan roots and love for rap music.\n\n\u201cI tell people, \u2018If you want a sisterhood of people who are always going to have your back, then derby is the place to be,\u2019\u201d Heimes said. \u201c\u2018If you\u2019re looking for an outlet because your job sucks or because you love your job and just need to hit somebody, derby is the place to be.\u2019\u201d\n\nMany women who start roller derby have never skated - minus a teenage rollerblading phase inspired by the \u201cX Games.\u201d If the referee at Thursday\u2019s practice is any indication, adding wheels to the equation requires extra athleticism.\n\n\u201cEverybody comes in seemingly nonathletic for some reason,\u201d Heimes said. \u201cAll of a sudden, you see the weight drop off and a transformation happens. You turn into this athlete.\u201d\n\nDavis is a textbook example. She talks about her first match with the same brevity as a professional athlete preparing for the playoffs - hungry for success, yet terrified of failure.\n\n\u201cI was over 200 pounds last fall and I had a goal,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI told myself if I lost 40 pounds, I would put skates on and become a derby girl.\u201d\n\n\u2018Double down\u2019\n\nDavis remembers watching an Army buddy play.\n\n\u201cIt seemed so surreal like, \u2018Wow, look at these girls in their fishnets and the eyeliner. They\u2019re super hardcore and just the endurance,\u2019\u201d Davis said. \u201cAt the time, I was in the service, too, and it was a different level of strength. It\u2019s funny, because six or seven years later, here I am in my mid-30s becoming an athlete.\u201d\n\nShe instantly detected a passion.\n\nThe sport is challenging, but it\u2019s worth it. Davis is in it for the knuckle pounding, the pats, the reassurance - everything that comes with being on a team.\n\n\u201cEveryone is working through whatever kind of day they had,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou put it in your skating. It\u2019s better than sitting in a bar. It\u2019s better than being obnoxiously rude to the people who love you. This is a place to work through whatever you got inside of you or get a killer workout.\u201d\n\nJen Gallaher, a longtime home team player, answers to Skelita - a nickname her daughter chose from the movie \u201cMonster High.\u201d She loves the newbies\u2019 enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cIt gives you all the feels,\u201d Gallaher said. \u201cYou start to remember what that was like.\u201d\n\nThe military presence deepens their connection. It shows when they forecast a deployment.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s another player whose husband is gone, it\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, bring your kids to practice. We\u2019ll double down,\u2019\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s one more support network where you\u2019re not alone and you don\u2019t feel like you have to go through something that can be devastating to a family.\u201d\n\n\u2018Full contact\u2019\n\nThe league has been around since 2008 - a feat considering a chunk of the players and their spouses are in the military and subject to sporadic relocation. Plus, it\u2019s nonprofit.\n\nThe sport has amateur all-women teams, male teams, co-ed teams and junior teams. Northwest Florida has a roller derby presence, with teams in Panama City, Pensacola and Mobile, Alabama. The Panhandle United All-Star Unicorns opens up tryouts to women from unranked neighboring roller derby teams who want to play for a WFTDA ranked team.\n\nTeam members practice biweekly - more if they\u2019re selected for the all-star team - pay for their equipment, travel and get banged up in the process. Yes, they pay to get hit.\n\nNo throwing punches, no elbows - roller derby is civilized with rules - but it isn\u2019t for the faint of heart either.\n\n\u201cWe use thighs and our hips and shoulders to hit people - full contact,\u201d Gallaher said.\n\nThe game brings out the same hate-love nature many athletes feel toward their craft.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what happens during this practice time that keeps people sticking to it - the whole, you\u2019re hitting, pushing, getting thrown around,\u201d Heimes said. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt by the end of the day and you want more.\u201d\n\n\u2018Train, eat, sleep\u2019\n\nRoller derby is trapped by its own duality.\n\nIt has the same ingredients as other sports - an offense and a defense, rules and referees to uphold them, coaches, players and a scoring system. But it, too, comes with kitschy nicknames, sparkly helmets and flashy tights. Although few would question the authenticity of football as a sport because of neon-colored receiver gloves, soccer because of a victory dance after a sweet goal or a boxing match because of a fighter\u2019s swagger entering the ring.\n\nFor some, the name conjures up images of women in fishnets hashing out aggression in cinematic girl fights.\n\n\u201cWe run into people all the time, \u2018You play roller derby? You throw people over the ledge? What do you do? Do you pull hair and fight?\u2019\u201d Heimes said. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018No, we don\u2019t do any of that. Geez. Come on.\u2019\n\nWhen Heimes started, she fit the stereotype.\n\n\u201cIt was, \u2018You have tattoos. You have piercings. You should join roller derby,\u2019\u201d Heimes said. \u201cThat was the sport back then. Now it\u2019s not like that. You have to train, eat, sleep roller derby to be effective.\u201d\n\nMany treat it like a professional sport, but unlike professional sports - or entertainment, for that matter - it doesn\u2019t reel in dollar signs or swarms of fans.\n\nThe players would like to see that change.\n\n\u201cIt is sad not a lot of people know about it,\u201d Gallaher said. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret hidden sport. Even people I work with, they\u2019re like, \u2018You play roller derby?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, it still exists apparently.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt used to be about big hits and throwing people at each other.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s so much more athletic, strategic,\u201d Heimes said. \u201cI think it maybe will make the Olympics one year.\u201d\n\nThe next generation\n\nPanhandle United Roller Derby players see the sport\u2019s placement in the cultural landscape.\n\nThey\u2019re here to rectify it.\n\nThey want to eliminate stigmas from the ghosts of roller derby decades\u2019 past. WFTDA gravitates toward an athletic image - especially in regard to apparel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not rugged and riddled with chaos; we\u2019re athletes,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe have boundaries. No midriffs. No booty shorts. We\u2019re trying to imitate our values as a family-focused organization. So keep it classy, but keep it tough.\u201d\n\nThe women are still allowed to express themselves, but in a respectful way, Davis said. In between watching her two children and binging on roller derby videos, she developed her own signature makeup look for her first bout.\n\n\u201cTrue story, I spent today\u2019s nap time trying different looks, different colored (eye) shadows to see, because this is my debut game as a new skater,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI want to look the part. I think that would help bolster my confidence.\u201d\n\nCoach Nicole Lee (aka Nicc Vicious) said there is a time to play and a time to be serious.\n\n\u201cI think your home team is the time to play,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt is serious game play, it is, but that\u2019s time to dress up and do those things. The sanctioned bouts, the ones we play for rankings, are the times to be serious in the sport.\u201d\n\nRoller derby\u2019s entry into the professional sports arena is stifled by an antiquated reputation. Heimes doesn\u2019t believe it will turn professional in her time, but maybe in her kid\u2019s time.\n\nLee agrees the sport\u2019s trajectory lies in the junior league.\n\n\u201cIf you look at high school basketball and high school football, it\u2019s nothing compared to junior roller derby when you get up into the ranking teams,\u201d Lee said. \u201cA lot of their games and the champs, we look up to them like, \u2018Wow, one day I wanna do that.\u2019 The juniors are really taking it to that level.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Northwest Florida Daily News (Fort Walton Beach, Fla.), http://www.nwfdailynews.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Aubree Davis ventured to the place everyone knows they need to go but no one ever actually wants to: outside her comfort zone.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Savannah Evanoff"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/exchange-roller_derby_empowerment_62216_c0-285-3296-2206_s1770x1032.jpg?a623dd20eaa351f0a220f4e37948b29844b55935", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
