Wholesale Inflation\n\nWholesale inflation figures arrive Tuesday, providing traders with further insight into the pace of price pressures.\n\nThe Labor Department will issue the (PPI) report at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). On average, economists expect the PPI rose 0.1% in September, the same as it rose the month before.\n\nThe , which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.2% last month, from 0.3% in August, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.\n\nThat would bring year-over-year PPI growth to 1.8% and core PPI growth up 2.3%, unchanged from a month earlier.\n\nThe PPI is considered a leading indicator, measuring the input prices for goods sold at a retail level.\n\n2. U.S. Crude Oil Inventories Set for Another Surprise Build?\n\nThe will be closely watched for signs on whether domestic crude inventories will continue to shrink following a draw last week.\n\nAPI data last week showed inventories fell 5.9 million barrels, though that differed from the 3.1 million build reported by the Energy Information Administration.\n\nOil prices reversed early gains to settle roughly flat at $52.75 per barrel amid worries of U.S. and China trade talks, slated for later this week.\n\n3. Levi Strauss, Domino's Pizza to Deliver Quarterly Earnings\n\nLevi's (NYSE: ) is set to report earnings on Tuesday after U.S. markets close.\n\nThe report comes as analysts are keen to establish whether the apparel retailer's efforts to expand beyond its native men\u2019s jeans business and its direct-to-consumer push have helped it to offset the sluggish retail backdrop that has weighed on its peers' margin growth.\n\nThe direct-to-consumer approach has gathered importance recently as department stores \u2013 who some merchants like Levi's have relied on for sales - come under pressure.\n\nAnnual sales at U.S. department stores fell 20% from 2017 to 2018, and are on pace to decline further this year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nLevi's is earnings of 28 cents per share on sales of $1.44 billion, according to estimates from Investing.com.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE: ) delivers results Tuesday before the market open, with the company earnings of $2.07 per share on sales of $824 million.\n\nBeyond earnings, same-store sales, which have been slowing for several quarters, will also come under the spotlight.\n\nThe company\u2019s sales have taken a hit from growing competition from third-party delivery providers such as Uber Eats, DoorDash and Grubhub (NYSE: ).", "description": "Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC9H0ML_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
