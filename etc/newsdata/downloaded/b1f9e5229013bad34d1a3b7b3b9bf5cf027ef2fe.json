He said the community battery concept had wider applications across Australia.\n\n\"We think this is a solution that can be rolled out across the community,'' he said.\n\nDr Schott said it was crucial that the difficult task of shaping a better grid structure for Australia, as renewable energy became a bigger part of the system, didn't become overburdened with extra costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolar panels had now turned into a big political issue, too, as part of the broader wrestling about energy policy.\n\n\"With rooftop solar, it's become a very political issue''.\n\nDr Schott said Australia's power grid was simply not structured right to cope with the rapid change in technology and shifting markets.\n\n\"We've got a grid at the moment that's not fit for purpose,'' she said.\n\nPart of the problem was that large renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines were in rural areas and there was a ''long, skinny string'' to connect those into the cities where the large populations were.\n\n\"That is really plaguing us at the moment.''\n\nTransitioning to a new modern network was a big challenge for Australia, but the country needed to be careful not to overbuild and build too fast, because those costs would find their way into customer's power bills.\n\nBut there was a big challenge in trying to forecast future energy demand given the vast changes in technology in other areas, such as how quickly electric vehicle take-up might be. \"It's quite difficult at the moment to estimate demand in the market.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElectric vehicles made up less than 0.5 per cent of the total vehicles on the road in Australia in 2018.\n\nDr Schott said the rapid take-up of household rooftop solar panels in Australian cities is causing energy security problems for energy distribution companies.\n\nShe said that in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide about 30 per cent of all homes now had rooftop solar panels, and about one in eight newer installations were including storage batteries as part of the household system.\n\nThose storage batteries caused extra headaches for distribution companies now dealing with ''bi-directional flows'' where households are also selling electricity back into the grid.\n\nDr Schott said the big take-up of solar panels meant that during the middle of the day there was often zero demand for energy from the grid, but then by 3pm or 4pm that dissipated.\n\nBut the fluctuations caused a big challenge.\n\n\"The so-called duck curve is really causing security issues for the distribution networks,'' she said.\n\nDr Schott also said that ageing coal-fired power stations like the Liddell plant in NSW weren't flexible enough to be part of the long-term future landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They are dinosaurs in that sense,'' she said. \"What we actually need in the market is energy that is both firm and flexible.''\n\nThe demand for ''flexible and firm'' power would keep rising and older coal-fired plants would find it difficult to stay commercially viable.", "description": "Ausgrid says a big ''community'' storage battery is a better bet in keeping power costs down than each household buying its own battery.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_74/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/206c9aed1aa19f38da6f7c7e65d1bd8fab8b8173", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
