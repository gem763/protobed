This came in response to the UP government saying it was not interested in legislating on temples and its limited role was restricted to only managing those temples which presented challenges of maintaining public order.\n\nFor several decades now, the issue of encroachment on public land by installing an idol around which a temple quickly grew has been a headache before authorities. There are also several private temples that have come up and there are also ancient temples that have been managed by local communities. In many states, governments have also formed temple boards to manage a large cluster of temples.

As for overnight street corner installation of deities and religious symbols that encroach public and forest land, the law must come cracking down on them.", "description": "The Supreme Court poser to the Uttar Pradesh government whether in the absence of legislation on temples and religious and charitable endowments anyone could install an idol, construct a temple and collect donations presents a...", "authors": ["Quick Edit"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/100x100-Quick-Edit-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
