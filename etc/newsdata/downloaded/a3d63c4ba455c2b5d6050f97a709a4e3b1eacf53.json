The endgame \u2014 not so much.\n\nU.S. financial markets are sputtering, the outlook for U.S. farm exports is worsening and a key gauge of American manufacturing just unexpectedly contracted for the first time in three years. The next victim of tariffs on Chinese goods may be consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of America\u2019s economic activity.\n\nAs Americans face the prospect of higher prices, it seems like a good moment to take a hard look at what exactly Trump is demanding from China. He often says he\u2019s using tariffs to fight for farmers and factory workers. But the dispute at its core is over something much more difficult to achieve than convincing Beijing to buy some soybeans or incentivizing a U.S. factory to leave China for Vietnam.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Trade Representative offered a timely reminder of what it argues are the key Chinese violations at the heart of Trump\u2019s trade war. In a little-noticed World Trade Organization legal brief filed in the midst of the latest volley of import taxes, USTR listed the following alleged Chinese abuses:\n\nUsing foreign ownership restrictions, including joint venture requirements and foreign equity limitations, to require or pressure technology transfer from foreign companies.\n\nTechnology regulation that forces foreign companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non-market-based terms that favor Chinese recipients.\n\nInvesting in and acquiring foreign companies and assets by Chinese companies to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property and generate the transfer of technology to Chinese companies.\n\nConducting and supporting unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of foreign companies to access their sensitive commercial information and trade secrets.\n\nChina denies it\u2019s a bad actor and even filed its own WTO complaint this week against the U.S. tariffs, saying it will defend the rules of the international trade system. If and when Trump is able to forge a deal with Xi Jinping \u2014 even a small one that can be sold as a big win \u2014 its impact will ultimately be judged on whether it fulfills USTR\u2019s four key objectives. For the moment, the prospect of such a result is getting harder and harder to see.\n\nCharting the Trade War\n\nHopes of finishing a monster Asia-Pacific trade pact by year\u2019s end may be headed for disappointment again. After seven years, talks have been mired in disagreements around how to regulate e-commerce and labor migration, among other issues. Now, under the weight of trade-war pressures, regional trade spats and a global economic slowdown, a November deadline is looking less realistic.\n\nToday\u2019s Must Reads\n\nStorm tracker | A gauge of the U.S. export outlook has plunged to the most dire spot on Bloomberg\u2019s Trade Tracker as the economic fallout from the trade war widens.\n\nRecession course | The U.K. may be headed for its first recession since the financial crisis after Brexit uncertainty hobbled the nation\u2019s services industries more than expected.\n\nEarly frost | The Bank of Canada is expected to open the door further to interest rate cuts amid worries U.S.-China tensions will curb a relatively robust expansion at home.\n\nConsumer drivers | JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) says global retail sales rose 4.8% last quarter, buoyed by still-tight labor markets.
