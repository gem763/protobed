Until last year nobody had achieved the 1500m and 5000m double in the 84-year history of the European Championship. The steely-eyed Norwegian went on to deliver the unprecedented, aged just 17. A year earlier he had become the youngest athlete to ever break the four-minute mile.\n\nGjert Arne Ingebrigtsen, Jakob\u2019s father and coach, has already published a book entitled \u201cHow to raise a world champion\u201d. The release feels premature, but brothers Fillip and Henrik also have designs on taking the title once monopolised by Sir Mo Farah on the pink track of Qatar\u2019s Khalifa International Stadium.\n\nThe feats this unique family have already achieved \u2013 each are already European gold medallists \u2013 brings a human fascination that will peak in Doha. \u201cHow to raise a world champion\u201d offers reflections on fatherhood as much as coaching. Gjert Arne had no template for either, raised by a single mother in a small village on the northernmost tip of Scandinavia.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Henrik became Norwegian champion twice, so we chose running [instead] because it was more difficult.\u201d\n\nFilip, who won a bronze medal in the 1500m at the London 2012 Olympics, remembers things slightly differently. \u201cWe were seven siblings and you need a lot of equipment to do well in winter sports. Running was more practical: our parents just needed to buy us some shoes and we could go to training. Our dad is pretty strict and he gives us lots of training.\n\n\u201cAlso nobody really did anything good in the summer Olympics so we wanted to do something unorthodox and go our own way.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rodal has watched the ascent of \u2018Team Ingebrigtsen\u2019 and believes intensive endurance training, unconventionally held within hours of major finals, is what sets them apart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about what they do after competitions in the recovery phase, after competitions: they always do recovery running with speed and intensity. Most runners don\u2019t do that,\u201d he says. \u201dThey have a theory that a tougher kind of recovery running is good after competition and they do it the same day as the race.\u201d\n\nRodal points to the unique high-intensity \u201crestitution\u201d running he witnessed during the Diamond League circuit this season. The brothers would race, fulfil their media duties across what can last up to two hours, before then \u201ccompleting interval sessions again: 10 x 300m at high speed. When Jakob and Filip were running in Lausanne they finished their session at 1am because they have their regime after competition.\u201d\n\nAs was the case in Switzerland, Doha\u2019s 5K final will start at around 9pm local time, meaning post-race sprint sessions, rather than Champagne flutes, as the clock strikes midnight. When Jakob secured the first leg of his European Championship double in Berlin his father advised him to mark the occasion with a warm glass of milk.\n\nHenrik, the eldest brother, will be spared the training session after the 5K final at the race marks the end of his season, but Jakob and Filip have a semi-final in their favoured 1500m later in the week.\n\nRodal says the regime is unique but that \u201cmore and more runners\u201d may look to emulate Team Ingebrigtsen. \u201cTheir talent is not the biomechanical part of it. They do not move especially well. They are very well prepared by training, that\u2019s what they do better than the rest.\u201d\n\nFilip dreads the post-race sessions but sees the value in them. \u201cIf you have a hard racing programme then there\u2019s not that many days to put mileage in, so race days are a nice day too to do some work. It helps with endurance.\u201d\n\nTeamGB\u2019s Jake Wightman won bronze behind Jakob over 1500m in Germany and will take on the same distance in Qatar. The Nottinghamshire runner won\u2019t contemplate doubling up at a world championships until he achieves his first medal at a global level and admits to being unable to relate to the notion of doing sprint training after a world championship final.\n\n\u201cIt helps flush the system out a little bit and gets another little bit of training stimulus but for me, racing is hard enough, so I just take the race as the big peak of the day,\" says Wightman. \"I don\u2019t want to have to think about doing a session after I race.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that they can all race together and almost help each other through races is their biggest strength. But each of them have got two of the best training partners in the world and they\u2019ve got a dad that completely understands them and from what I know from being coached by my dad, it\u2019s always a good thing if you\u2019ve got that.\n\n\u201cTheir setup is amazing and the way they race is just perfect every time, so I think they\u2019re definitely going to be able to take it to the Kenyans.\u201d\n\nHenrik has been hampered by injury in recent years but his siblings are both confident of glory. Filip says that at 26-years-old he is at the \u201cpeak age for a European athlete\u201d. Jakob, for his part, considers the mid-twenties \u201cold\u201d for a modern middle-distance runner, arguing there should be no reason why European athletes cannot peak at the same age as counterparts from East Africa.\n\n\u201cJakob has followed his older brothers [on training runs] since he was about seven or eight years old,\u201d Rodal adds. \u201cIt\u2019s not training like we\u2019re used to in Norway: long distances, a lot of training for their age. That\u2019s also what they do in Kenya and Ethiopia and you see a lot of 18-year-old boys and girls from those countries performing very well. I think it\u2019s possible for young people to absorb a lot of training and aside of that he\u2019s also very talented. The whole family has high haemoglobin values and they have physical [attributes] for long distance running.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe father has perhaps learned what works from Henrik trying and \u2018failing\u2019. I always think that Filip is maybe the most talented but Jakob has a stronger mentality. I used to think that Jakob might be too big, too tall, too heavy to run very good [times] but he does not seem to be afraid of anything. He\u2019s a machine. Two years ago in the national championship he ran the 800, 1500, 5K, and the steeplechase, all in three days.\u201d\n\nThe title of Gjert Arne\u2019s book shows the ambitions he holds for his children has no limits, though his dual role appears to sometimes leave him conflicted over whether to play expectations up or down. \u201cWe have a long-term plan do as best as we can, to be among the best in the world in the long term,\u201d he says. Asked to define the \u2018end\u2019 of the long term plan, he says \u201cseeing all three boys in a global final\u201d, which is exactly what will happen in Doha. \u201cWe are doing this for fun,\u201d he insists.\n\nJakob appears unfazed by what is expected of him. \u201cI never dreamt of a gold medal,\u201d he tells The Independent. \u201cIt\u2019s my goal to take a gold medal. I think that\u2019s a big difference. I don\u2019t dream, I set goals and I work hard to reach those goals. My goal is not to have Filip and Henrik in the final. My goal is to be in the final myself and after that I think it\u2019s going to be really exciting.\u201d", "description": "The precocious middle-distance runner Jakob Ingebrigtsen approaches this month\u2019s World Athletics Championships knowing he is the worst-kept secret in the competition.
