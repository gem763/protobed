This is Alexei Oreskovic, Business Insider's West Coast Bureau Chief and Global Tech Editor. I've got lots of great stuff to share this week. And remember, if you're not already subscribed to the newsletter, you can sign up here.\n\nThis week: How Google's smartwatch dreams shattered\n\nSteve Jobs famously called Google's Android mobile software a rip-off of Apple's iPhone. Even though Google's Android was basically a me-too product that came out more than a year after the iPhone, it went on to dominate the market by providing an operating system \u2014 Android \u2014 that Samsung, LG and every other hardware maker could use to create their own smartphones.\n\nWhen it comes to smartwatches, the situation is almost exactly reversed. Google released its Android Wear software for smartwatches a year before the Apple Watch came out. But today, the Apple Watch is the Number One player, with 37% of the market, while Google's smartwatch software languishes with a paltry 6% of the market.\n\nIf you're not yet a subscriber to Trending, BI Prime's tech newsletter, you can sign up here.\n\nIt's a surprising turn of events, and Nick Bastone's in-depth report about Google's smartwatch saga shows how the company misjudged and mishandled the biggest new tech product to emerge since the smartphone. A much-speculated about Google-designed smartwatch was in fact ready to go back in 2016, but fell victim to an internal reorg and shifting priorities. As Apple Watch continues to gain momentum, Google's software-only strategy looks increasingly out of sync with today's smartwatch market. But a Google-designed hardware watch is unlikely to come anytime soon, Nick reports. And until it does, Google's smartwatch business is effectively stalled.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider; Samantha Lee/Business Insider; VCG/Visual China Group via Getty Images\n\nBulking up for the Cloud Wars\n\nOne business where Google is making big strides is in the cloud, and Rosalie Chan's list of the power players at Google Cloud is a must-read.\n\nGoogle's cloud business may still be playing catch up to Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, but new boss Thomas Kurian is not the kind of guy who likes to be in third place. The Google Cloud business is now on an $8 billion annual run rate, and Kurian is on a hiring spree, beefing up the ranks with executive and programming talent.\n\nAs Rosalie has previously reported, Google is also revamping its compensation and sales structure, as Kurian and team charge forward.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nGoogle; Shayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nBadge Bias\n\nWhen it comes to diversity, Google suffers from many of the same problems as other Silicon Valley companies, where minorities and women are underrepresented in the programming ranks and in leadership roles.\n\nThis lack of diversity is pernicious on many levels, especially as important, society-changing technologies like artificial intelligence are being developed that are susceptible to the bias of their creators. As Melia Russell reports, the lack of diversity in tech can also feed on itself, through everyday interactions that can make underrepresented groups feel like outsiders. Consider for example, the standard practice of checking employee badges on Silicon Valley's open campuses.\n\nAs a sidenote, I want to welcome Melia back to Business Insider for her second tour of duty! She's covering VCs, startups and the various issues affecting the tech workforce these days. So stay tuned for more great stories.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nMelia Russell/Business Insider\n\nOther recent tech highlights:", "description": "Also in this week's Trending newsletter, we look at Google Cloud's power players and the ongoing diversity problems in Silicon Valley.", "authors": ["Alexei Oreskovic"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
