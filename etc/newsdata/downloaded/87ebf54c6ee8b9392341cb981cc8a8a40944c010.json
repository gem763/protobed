Time\n\nThe commercial real estate company WeWork may be looking to lean out its tech department after withdrawing its registration for an initial public offering just over a week ago.\n\nThe latest potential shakeup at the company could involve cutting a third of its technology roles, The Information reports. Bloomberg recently reported that WeWork could cut as many as 2,000 jobs by the end of October.\n\nThe first round of job cuts would hit the software engineering department, product management staff and data science teams, according to The Information. Citing a person familiar with the matter, the publication said Tuesday that roughly 500 tech jobs could be lost.\n\nThough plans have not been finalized yet, the company would slash 350 roles in its corporate division, and another 150 candidates could be laid off as WeWork looks to sell recently acquired assets, said the report.\n\nWeWork, Uber, Juul: CEO ousters that have gripped the headlines\n\nHelp with the mortgage: More married couples bring in roommates to ease cost, study shows\n\nWeWork.
