Tom Cotton argued that such a public missive would put vulnerable Republicans up for reelection in 2020 in a difficult spot: sign it, and you\u2019re committing yourself to defend the president; refuse, and you\u2019re making yourself a potential target of Trump\u2019s ire. ... In the week since this contentious lunch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly worked with Graham to remove some of the more incendiary aspects of his proposed letter related to the substance of the ongoing impeachment inquiry, shifting the focus of the resolution instead to safer process arguments. The result? More than 40 Republican senators have joined as co-sponsors, arguing the Democrat-led House is \u201cabandoning more than a century\u2019s worth of precedent\u201d by \u201cdenying President Trump due process.\u201d\n\nGraham has now added to his list of co-sponsors, leaving just three GOP senators who haven\u2019t signed on -- Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Lisa Murkwoski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine). But the original list of eight holdouts and hesitant senators was a conspicuous one. And they might be worth watching when it comes to whether Trump\u2019s firewall against removal in the Senate starts to show cracks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s what we can say about them:\n\nOne was Romney, which perhaps isn\u2019t surprising. Two were the GOP senators facing reelection in blue states: Collins and Cory Gardner of Colorado. The list included three of the four GOP senators who are retiring: Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Mike Enzi of Wyoming and Johnny Isakson of Georgia (the last of whom is expected to resign at the end of the year and may not be around to vote in an impeachment trial). The other two were Murkowski, an occasional holdout in situations like these, and Rob Portman (Ohio), whose place on this list might be the most interesting.\n\nApart from Romney, many of these members have talked about impeachment in similar terms. They have raised concerns about Trump\u2019s actions, while also tossing in some comments about how it\u2019s too early to impeach or critiques of the Democrats\u2019 process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for the president to be talking with foreign governments about investigating his political opponents, but impeachment would be a mistake,\u201d Alexander said earlier this month. He added that the 2020 election would be better at deciding. Alexander has also declined to comment further, noting that he would be a juror in a Senate impeachment trial.\n\nCollins has offered similar comments about being a juror, but she was even more critical of Trump\u2019s request for China to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent,\u201d Collins told Bangor Daily News. \u201cIt\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCollins added hat she didn\u2019t like how House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) has conducted himself. But she also criticized colleagues who were prejudging the evidence.\n\n\u201cI am amazed that some of my colleagues have already made up their mind one way or the other before all of the evidence is in and before the facts are known,\u201d she told USA Today. \u201cI think that\u2019s entirely inappropriate, whether they are for the impeachment or against the impeachment.\n\nAD\n\nIsakson, notably, has encouraged the Senate to investigate these matters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he crossed the lines or not, but I know we\u2019ve got the weight in the intelligence committees to get to the bottom of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the subpoena power to do it, and they have the authority to do it.\u201d\n\nGardner has raised perhaps the most process complaints of the eight, calling the impeachment inquiry a \u201cpartisan exercise,\u201d but he too has perhaps cracked the door to the idea that Trump did something wrong.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are going to get into an investigation of this. I know you want me to say things before the investigation occurs,\u201d he said recently. \u201cThis is about impeachment of the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOf the eight, Murkowski\u2019s comments might be the most biting. After acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney last week admitted military aid was held up of because Ukraine hadn\u2019t investigated a conspiracy theory that Trump favors (Mulvaney later recanted), Murkowski offered a sharp comment.\n\n\u201cYes, absolutely it\u2019s a concern,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period.\u201d\n\nThe third retiree, Enzi, has basically only said one word about all of this \u2014 \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 when asked if he had a comment.\n\nWhich brings us to Portman. There was a time when Trump actually hailed Portman\u2019s comments about all of this. But two weeks ago, Portman bucked.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period. It\u2019s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent,\u201d Portman said. He also raised concerns about Trump\u2019s praise for a former Ukrainian prosecutor general and said that \u201cit may have been inappropriate\u201d for Trump to involve Attorney General William P. Barr in the matter. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t view it as an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nPortman seems like as good a barometer as any for where this is going. The retirees might have more political leeway, and the vulnerable senators have reason to keep their powder dry. Few have been as upfront about their reservations as Portman, though, and this is a guy who apparently played a significant role in getting Trump to eventually release that military aid to Ukraine, after weeks of holding it up.\n\nJust because a member co-sponsors Graham\u2019s resolution doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t vote for removal, of course, but this was a conspicuous group to be initially left out.\n\nAD", "description": "Many have expressed reservations about the process -- while also criticizing Trump's actions.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nUn7Sh4q9kmXHQ6HsRXXUEErHZc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4RG35AXXBYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
