According to US Weekly, which broke the news of the union back in August, the Emmy nominated actress and the comedian who is very good at dating are no longer whatever they were for a few months around the summer and start of fall. (Or were they just a creation of US all along? Who can really say?) A \u201cclose source\u201d tells the publication the two \u201cremain friends,\u201d which is nice to hear. You\u2019d hate for some lovely boat rides around Venice and time spent at airports together to end acrimoniously. Qualley is both an up and coming actress and the daughter of the delightful Andie MacDowell, while Davidson has a fair amount of Hollywood heat around him and is currently shooting Suicide Squad. He also started the year dating Kate Beckinsale. So, these two are probably going to be just fine.", "description": "Pete Davidson and actress Margaret Qualley had reportedly been dating, and now they are reportedly not dating anymore.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/28/28-qualley-davidson-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
