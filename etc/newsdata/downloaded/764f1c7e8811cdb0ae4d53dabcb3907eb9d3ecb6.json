We have just started, he is here to help me,\" Sevigny, who played three seasons with the Montreal Canadians, told the outlet.\n\nA picture of Brashear smiling while standing behind a drive-through window was published with the story.\n\nTRUMP SHOUTS OUT ST. LOUIS BLUES SUPERFAN LAILA ANDERSON DURING WHITE HOUSE CEREMONY\n\nCTV followed up the story, which focused heavily on Brashear\u2019s $15 million career and subsequent struggles with the law.\n\nHockey fans took to social media to slam the outlets for what some called \u201cjob shaming.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s National Post was also heavily criticized after writing the same story but incorrectly using a picture of Georges Laraque, another black NHL player.\n\nLaraque saw the story and \u2013 trying to make light of the obvious blunder \u2013 tweeted it himself with this caption: \u201cCan someone tell the National Post that Brashear has no hair and I got dreadlocks! Laugh out Loud.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Post quickly issued a statement putting the blame on a \u201cmisattribution\u201d in \u201cthe photo's caption from our wire service.\u201d\n\nBrashear played 15 seasons in the NHL and was known for his rough and tough playing style. He played for five different organizations and is currently ranked 15th all-time in NHL penalty minutes.", "description": "Former NHL enforcer Donald Brashear saw an outpouring of support from fans on social media this week after several Canadian news outlets seemingly shamed him following a story that the hockey pro had taken up employment at a local Tim Hortons.", "authors": ["Paulina Dedaj", "Paulina Dedaj Is A Writer", "Reporter For Fox News.
