The industry body described the claims by the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is in charge of no-deal planning, as \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d.\n\nIt didn\u2019t use the L-word (liar) but the words it did use are about as close as you\u2019ll ever see one of these organisations getting to that stage. The statement effectively says: Mr Gove your pants are well and truly on fire. You might struggle to get replacements given the mess you and your colleagues propose to create at UK ports, too.\n\nNow, trade bodies exist to lobby for their industries. Part of that involves them making noise, and providing cover for their members by saying things they are reluctant to say themselves. But their statements tend to be tempered by the fact that they also like to maintain good relationships with government for the purposes of doing the all-important behind-the-scenes business. What prompted the BRC to more or less abandon this and take the gloves off in such a fierce manner?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nPartly it was born of frustration. The BRC has done a lot of work on the impact of no deal across the retail industry, with a view to assisting its members who will have to deal with it. Needless to say, it doesn\u2019t like what it sees. It doesn\u2019t like it at all.\n\nThe work has been hampered by a huge number of unknowns faced by its members. What will the tariff schedule for goods coming in ultimately look like? How long will the delays at customs be? Will hauliers be willing to send trucks to the UK during the initial chaos when it might pay them to look for work elsewhere?\n\nOctober is a particularly bad time for this to occur for food retailers because there are lots of things the UK can\u2019t grow in the autumn. If you want tomatoes, you\u2019d best get your tins in. There is also an issue with EU migrant labour. Workers from this pool pack and clean incoming produce. We now know that free movement won\u2019t end on 31 October after all. But will that labour hang around, given the growing list of problems with the \u201csettled status\u201d created for them?\n\nThe problem that organisations like the BRC face is that raising issues like these ones with government isn\u2019t getting them anywhere, either in public or behind the scenes. Boris Johnson\u2019s administration isn\u2019t listening to anyone other than its own extremists. It it is playing a deadly game of poker with the British people and British business. Governing doesn\u2019t seem to matter to it. There is one final calculation at work in the BRC getting its punches in now: the blame game. The statement confers upon the BRC the right to say: \u201cSee, we told you so. We raised all these issues, we did the work and yet you ignored us.\u201d\n\nJohnson and co will do their utmost to try to deflect being called to account for their actions in the aftermath of a no-deal outcome. Some \u00a3100m is being splurged on the \u201cget ready\u201d campaign with that in mind. The intention seems to be for ministers to claim that they warned business but weren\u2019t listened to. The BRC\u2019s statement makes clear that this won\u2019t wash. Retailers have already done their utmost. They\u2019re still at it. They are stockpiling where they can. They are working with their suppliers. They have carefully reviewed their supply chains.\n\nThey have, in other words, done everything they can given the unknowns they face. However much Mr Gove and his colleagues twist and turn, any shortages, any foul-ups, will be on them and them alone. And they must be called to account.", "description": "When Michael Gove dismissed\u00a0talk of fresh food shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit\u00a0on The Andrew Marr\u00a0Show, the level of anger he provoked from the\u00a0British Retail Consortium was startling.\u00a0The industry body described the claims by the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,\u00a0who is in charge of no-deal planning, as \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d.", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/16/gove-front-3.jpg"}
