He also says he supports vaccines.\n\nHe argued people need 'full information' and asked Zuckerberg why, since he believes in 'giving people a voice,' that anti-vaccine content is so hard to find on Facebook's platform.\n\n'I support vaccinations of children and adults, but also support open and frank communications of the risks of vaccination. Every person should make vaccination decisions with full information,' Posey said.\n\n'From time to time medical research has established case in context of specific risks associated with vaccinations. Today you testify you believe in giving people a voice and, Mr. Zuckerberg, is Facebook able to assure us that will support users fair and open discussions and communications related to the risk, as well as the benefit of vaccinations,' he asked.\n\nZuckerberg looked surprised at the question and fumbled a bit in his response.\n\n'We do care deeply about giving people a voice and freedom of expression,' he said. 'Those are some of the founding values of the company. At the same time, we also hear consistently from our community that people want us to stop the spread of misinformation. So, what we do is we try to focus on on misinformation that has the potential to lead to physical harm or imminent harm.'\n\nRepublican Congressman Bill Posey questioned Mark Zuckerberg why Facebook cracks down on anti-vaxx content\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company tries 'to stop the spread of misinformation'\n\n'Are you 100% confident that vaccines pose no injury to any person on his planet,' Posey followed up.\n\n'Congressman I don't think it would be possible for anyone to be 100% confident, but my understanding of the scientific consensus is that it is important that people get their vaccines,' Zuckerberg responded.\n\nShouldn't somebody have the opportunity to express an opinion different,' Posey pressed him. 'Don't you think people should be able to have information to make an informed choice.'\n\n'Congressman I do, and that's why we don't stop people from posting on their page,' Zuckerberg responded. 'If someone wants to post anti vaccination content or if they want to join a group where people are discussing that content, we don't prevent them from doing that. But what we do is, we, we don't go out of our way to make sure that our group recommendation system is trying to show people or encourage people to join those groups. We, we discourage that.'\n\nThe anti-vaxx movement is a refusal by people to get themselves or their children vaccinated.\n\nThe World Health Organization said it was one of the top 10 global threats in the world.\n\nAnti-vaxxers argue vaccines can cause autism and other problems but there has been no scientific evidence to back up such claims.\n\nSome regions have seen outbreaks of polio, along with higher cases of measles, which is attributed to the anti-vaccine movement.\n\nZuckerberg arrived on Capitol Hill Wednesday morning to be the sole witness before the House Financial Services Committee hearing on his company's proposed digital currency and its plans to combat election interference in the 2020 contest.\n\nAdditionally he was pressed about his company's plans to combat election interference, fight online sex traffickers, anti-discrimination practices, and his proposed digital currency.", "description": "Anti-vaccines came up during Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress, when a GOP Rep.
