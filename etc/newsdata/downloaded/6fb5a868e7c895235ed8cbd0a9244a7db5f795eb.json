She said it had the full approval of authorities in China, who have issued a series of increasingly dire threats to protesters who have filled the streets of the city and reduced activities at Hong Kong\u2019s busy airport almost to a crawl.\n\n\u201cThroughout the whole process, the Central People\u2019s Government took the position that they understood why we have to do it. They respect my view, and they support me all the way,\u201d Lam asserted.\n\nIt should not be misinterpreted as a show of weakness or a softening of resolve in Beijing\n\nThe extradition bill sparked alarm on several fronts. Although local courts are viewed as independent and relatively trustworthy, Hong Kong people are well aware that justice on the mainland is a political matter dictated by Communist party leaders. The prospect that Hong Kong residents who displease Beijing could be summarily scooped up and shipped off to a cell in China at the whim of some anonymous official sparked understandable fear among the city\u2019s populace. They didn\u2019t have to look far to justify their alarm: in 2015, several members of the staff of a Hong Kong book shop known to carry political tracts banned on the mainland went missing and were later revealed to have been detained in China.\n\nThe bill also continued the steady erosion of democratic rights Hong Kong was promised when control was transferred from Britain to China. Although the city\u2019s vibrant economy acts as an ongoing attraction to many of its residents, they are anything but sanguine about China\u2019s willingness to abide by its pledges. That distrust is the reason hundreds of thousands have obtained passports in foreign boltholes like Canada, to be used when needed.\n\nWariness of Beijing\u2019s intentions has risen steadily since Xi Jinping\u2019s elevation to China\u2019s presidency brought a new aggressiveness to mainland policies; the extradition bill brought it to the surface. As usual, the immediate inclination among communist rulers was the use of force. Early demonstrations were met with the customary threats and shrill warnings, accompanied by a buildup of troops and transparent attempts to frighten protesters into compliance. When those efforts only increased opposition, China sought to undermine public support, pressuring businesses and local acolytes into spreading its fear campaign. Now China evidently hopes it can buy off part of the resistance by offering a retreat on one of the movement\u2019s central demands.\n\nIt\u2019s an important compromise, and a clear victory for the people who have endured great risk by daring to confront the ruthlessness of the communist apparatus. But it should not fool anyone into thinking Beijing has softened its determination to bring Hong Kong to heel, or its willingness to use whatever means are required.\n\nIt\u2019s an important compromise, and a clear victory for the people who have endured great risk\n\nThough Chinese troops have been kept from repeating the brutal tactics used to massacre opponents in Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, it\u2019s not due to any absence of will. Hong Kong\u2019s status as a financial hub and trade centre is too important to China to risk the international opprobrium that would inevitably follow. The country\u2019s leaders were willing to endure the temporary ostracism that followed Tiananmen because it was a direct threat to communist rule and took place on the very doorstep of its power. The country\u2019s economy has grown and evolved greatly since then, however, and the repercussions from a repeat in Hong Kong would be far greater and more painful in a country where hundreds of millions of people now expect a higher degree of prosperity than any imagined in 1989.\n\nCommunist rulers nonetheless see the uproar in Hong Kong as a direct challenge to their right to rule as they see fit. Intense censorship means details can be kept from much of the mainland population, but should the view spread nonetheless that Beijing could be successfully pressured by public opposition, it would be seen as a danger too great to be tolerated.\n\nPresident Xi has a significant personal stake in the outcome as well, as his position at the apex of the communist regime would be weakened by any perception of failure. Though he has concentrated greater power in his own hands than all but one or two previous Chinese communist rulers, it would be wrong to assume all those underlings dutifully chanting his praise wouldn\u2019t quickly switch allegiance if the situation called for it.\n\nSo a different approach to Hong Kong is required, but with the same goal in mind. Reports indicated Lam had previously proposed withdrawing the bill, but was blocked by China, and the official China Daily acknowledged its change of mind was no more than an olive branch aimed at undermining public sympathy for the protests. It would be foolish to anticipate further concessions, especially the demand that Hong Kong be allowed to democratically choose its own leaders.\n\nChina is only waiting for the right opportunity to get what it wants, with the minimum of consequences to itself. The aggressiveness of the police response suggests loyalties on the force have been successfully shifted away from Hong Kong towards greater fealty to Beijing. Pressure on protesters will continue steadily, like a boa constrictor slowly squeezing life from a victim. They take names in Beijing, and they don\u2019t forget.", "description": "China is only waiting for the right opportunity to get what it wants, with the minimum of consequences to itself", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/protesters-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
