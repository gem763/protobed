The premises, which is meant to house a municipal caretaker, stationed at the Pieter Rademeyer Community Hall, has been vacant since November 2018.\n\nWhen PE Express visited the premises, it had been stripped of its doors, windows and plumbing materials, and the furniture had been stolen. In addition, it will cost the metro thousands of rands to clean and fix the building.\n\nAccording to the DA\u2019s spokesperson for safety and security, Gustav Rautenbach, the house fell apart due to the lack of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (NMBM) monitoring and safeguarding the premises.\n\nRautenbach said because there were no security guards, drug addicts found refuge in the building to carry out criminal activities.\n\n\u201cWhen I first visited the building, it was an eyesore and the smell was unbearable. Two people were inside the building and we chased them away. It was in such a dire state and criminals used this building as a place to sleep and use drugs. Everything that was of value was stolen, and the entire premises looked like a dumping site,\u201d Rautenbach said.\n\nOne of the residents in the area, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed his concern regarding the safety of the community.\n\n\u201cWe cannot just stand idle and let this situation become worse. No one is safe in our area or when they visit the hall. If there is an event at the hall, the visitors are attacked and robbed.\n\n\u201cWhen we approached our ward councillor, he did nothing about this situation. We contacted Councillor Rautenbach when we could not reach our ward councillor. The criminals use this building as their safe haven.\n\n\u201cThey use drugs and break into our homes. This is an absolute nightmare and has been going on for too long,\u201d he said. Rautenbach said the municipality had been made aware of the problem multiple times.\n\nRautenbach added, \u201cThe metro police have been to the premises more than once. However, nothing was done. The bathroom in the house is currently out of order as water pipes have been stolen.\u201d\n\nWhen PE Express visited the premises, one of the vagrants was in the process of using drugs. Municipal officials, including Rautenbach, chased her away. She responded that she would be back the evening as the house \u201cbelonged to her\u201d.\n\nAfter Rautenbach queried the incident, security was made available 24/7 and a plan to clean the premises was approved.\n\n\u201cThe premises was recently cleaned. However, the entire building needs an upgrade, which will include water pipes, lights and an electricity metre before the caretaker can move in. That will be my next mission \u2013 to ensure that the building is returned to its former glory. I\u2019m a former resident of Algoa Park and the community is still of vital importance to me,\u201d Rautenbach said.\n\nThe municipality and the ward councillor failed to respond, after two weeks of enquiries by Port Elizabeth Express for comment.", "description": "THE vandalism of a vacant municipal building has caused havoc for residents in Algoa Park, following a spike in crime in this area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9082/7ba78855f09d45829d77a7afc201bca8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-10"}
