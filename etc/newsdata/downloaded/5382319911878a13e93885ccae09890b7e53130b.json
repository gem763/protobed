However, if those efforts fail he will be equally clear that he will not discuss or accept any extension and will simply take the UK out of the EU with no agreement.\n\nThe prime minister is expected to tell the commission president: \u201cWe\u2019re leaving on 31 October, come what may \u2013 so let\u2019s work hard to get a deal in the time remaining. Some MPs have been peddling a myth that I am not serious about getting a deal. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am striving for a deal and I think we can achieve this. I will commit UK officials and my lead negotiator to work flat out to come up with a new agreement without being trapped into EU laws.\u201d\n\nHe is expected to add: \u201cThere should be no doubt about my determination to take us out on 31 October. I will not ask for an extension. I absolutely believe that our friends in Europe want an orderly exit, so now is the time for serious talks.\u201d\n\nA No 10 source said there was no chance of the prime minister going cap in hand to the EU summit in mid- October. \u201cThe PM will not negotiate a delay at the Brussels council,\u201d the source said, before suggesting there could be legal challenges.\n\n\u201cWe expect there to be a major court battle immediately after the 19th [of October] and attempts to pass legislation revoking article 50, which the prime minister will refuse to consider in any circumstances. Conservative MPs who want another delay don\u2019t understand that this would probably destroy the Conservative party and put [Jeremy] Corbyn into No 10.\u201d\n\nJohnson took aim last night at opposition parties and the 21 rebel Tories who voted for the legislation to block no deal before being stripped of the party whip. In a statement, he told voters: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by Corbyn and the ringleaders. On the one hand, they say I don\u2019t want a deal. On the other, they want to force me to extend. Both are wrong. I am straining to get a deal, but I will also end the uncertainty and take us out on 31 October.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, warned the prime minister not to pursue an illegal strategy.

If the prime minister thinks parliament is going to stand by while he breaks the law, then he has another think coming.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s attempt to frame the Brexit argument as one between obstructive MPs in parliament and the 52% of the British people who voted to leave the EU now threatens to spiral into a confrontation involving the courts.\n\nDowning Street is, according to insiders, examining whether it can challenge in the courts the interpretation of the new legislation (the so-called Benn act) to block no deal and is looking for other ways to prevent Johnson having to seek an extension.\n\nOn Saturday David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, said he believed there might well be a way \u201cto effectively legally kill off the Benn bill\u201d.\n\nSeparately the supreme court will begin a joint hearing this week on whether the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks until mid-October was lawful, after legal challenges in the English, Scottish and Northern Irish courts.\n\nWhile English and Northern Irish judges have ruled that the suspension of parliament was lawful, three Scottish appeal court judges concluded last week that the decision was unlawful, as suspension was clearly an attempt to \u201cstymie\u201d the House of Commons and prevent MPs from scrutinising the government over Brexit. A final supreme court ruling is expected this week or early next week.\n\nJoanna Cherry QC, the SNP MP who jointly led the successful legal challenge in Scotland, said she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the supreme court would follow the Scottish judges on the grounds that, while the courts cannot subject the executive to political scrutiny, they have a duty to ensure that the body charged with doing so \u2013 parliament \u2013 is able to perform that task.\n\nDowning Street said that David Frost was making good progress in talks with DUP leaders, which could lead to a breakthrough on the issue of the Irish border. While the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has denied that her party is shifting its position and would now be prepared to accept regulatory checks in the Irish Sea and some regulatory divergence from Britain \u2013 assuming there is consent from the provinces \u2013 Johnson\u2019s officials are determined to show that they are serious about avoiding a no deal.\n\nSpeaking at a People\u2019s Vote rally in Belfast on Saturday, the former Tory MP and attorney general Dominic Grieve, one of the 21 Conservatives who lost the whip, said Brexit would harm the Northern Irish economy whatever deal was reached and, in turn, a border would endanger peace. \u201cWhether the rules in Northern Ireland follow those of the EU or those of the rest of the UK, one thing is certain \u2013 there will be an economic border placed in the way of business in Northern Ireland which does not exist today.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of divisions in cabinet over Brexit on Saturday, culture secretary Nicky Morgan said that if there was a second referendum she would vote Remain. \u201cMy instincts are that I was sorry that the Remain campaign didn\u2019t win in 2016 and that really I\u2019m sorry that we\u2019ve seen all the division and uncertainty over the last three-and-a-half years,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\nShe added she voted to stay in the EU \u201cfor the same reasons that I felt very firmly back in 2016 and I campaigned for Remain\u201d - which she said were both economic and geopolitical.", "description": "Prime minister warns Brussels that he will reject any offer of prolonged membership and renews his threat of no deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/202daad22fd3aa82b19e26ea4166657e248ad640/0_17_3028_1817/master/3028.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0dd2a9ac9e0fff15a9274ddfb00a0c7", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
