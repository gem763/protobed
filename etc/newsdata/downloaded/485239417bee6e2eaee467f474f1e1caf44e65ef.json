You know, we have a lot of really serious conversations with Aleena and helping her to understand what it means to be a Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka woman in modern society and the challenges of that.\n\nWe've had those serious conversations that most families probably don't have to have with their children. It's a challenge to live with your culture, and with your traditional values and way of life in today's society.\n\nIn Haudenosaunee culture, we're always told to listen to our children, you know, that they have a lot of insight and a lot to offer us because they're strongly still connected to that spirit world.\n\nOur children, they don't see how the world sees them.\n\nFor the Haudenosaunee people, art is really about connecting our appreciation and our respect for the world that we live in, right? And a lot of art, as we know, is a mirror to the natural world. It's a universal language.\n\nRight now is really this period of cultural resurgence for Indigenous people in Canada and I think that for our young people especially, they're really looking towards identifying who they are and making that a really important piece of their lives. And our people have shown that strong resilience to be able to maintain that in the face of what's happened to us, we've retained who we are.\n\nYou know, we're told that when we dance ceremonially that we are \u2014 that we are dancing for the Creator.\"\n\nAleena (daughter): \"It shows everybody and the Creator, like, how we are thankful to have this gift and be able to share with people to make them happy.\"\n\nAmber: \"She's one of few, you know, young Indigenous women who have the opportunity to engage in a more modern form of dance and art.\n\nThrough that, she's able to \u2014 to begin to break down some of those stereotypes and those narratives that exists out there about what it means to be an Indigenous woman.\"\n\nThe Art of Parenting offers an intimate conversation with some of the most memorable families featured in the CBC Kids broadcast series The Art Show. The parents speak candidly and emotionally about how their own history, upbringing, belief system and circumstances have influenced their parenting style and resulted in raising of some truly phenomenal kids.", "description": "This mother has had several conversations with her daughter on what it means to be a Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka woman in modern society.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/aleena-art-of-parenting.jpg"}
