The four-minute mile or the four-minute failure. Both, in their way, pushed back the boundary of the possible. The world knew Bannister was good, but not that good. The world knows Boris Johnson is hopeless, but this bad?\n\nFirst thing Thursday morning, the deal was off. The Democratic Unionist Party had refused to sign up to it. There was no way it was getting through the House of Commons. That\u2019s it. The end.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThen, at 10.35am, everything changed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control,\u201d Boris Johnson announced, via his own Twitter account, the first of a string of six triumphant tweets whose triumph would last for around 240 seconds.\n\nAt 10.39am the DUP announced themselves that, no, they hadn\u2019t changed their minds, their statement \u201cstill stands\u201d. They would not be voting for the deal, and therefore the chances of it passing the House of Commons are close to zero.\n\nIt is hard to know whether Johnson enjoyed his four short minutes in which, in the eyes of the world, it was possible he was not the worst British prime minister in history. The answer is probably not.\n\nBecause from the beginning, to the end and right the way through the middle of his full 240 seconds of artificial triumph, he knew the truth, even if the rest of us did not. That his deal was dead before it began. That in fact, the duration of his success, like his parliamentary majority, can only be measured in negative numbers.\n\nIn Brussels and in Westminster, the gathered masses went through the motions anyway. A press conference was held, a statement issued, documents published.\n\nThe news was announced in the House of Commons by Jacob Rees-Mogg, to the exultant waggling of order papers up on the backbenches by the door where the hard Brexit contingent like to sit.\n\nIt was from those seats, by the way, that Robin Cook rose in 2003, to announce his resignation from the cabinet over the Iraq War. It is quite rightly remembered as one of the great speeches in the long history of that hallowed room, from which one especially sharp bit of reasoning stands out from the rest.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\n\u201cI applaud the heroic efforts that the prime minister has made in trying to secure a second resolution,\u201d he said then.\n\n\u201cBut the very intensity of those attempts underlines how important it was to succeed.\n\n\u201cNow that those attempts have failed, we cannot pretend that getting a second resolution was of no importance.\u201d\n\nAnd so it is again. If having the DUP onside were not entirely crucial, Boris Johnson would not have spent most of yesterday and all of last night trying to persuade them. He has failed. We cannot pretend it was of no importance.\n\nAn hour later, Johnson appeared in Brussels, to stand behind a lectern with Jean-Claude Juncker and make a few comments.\n\n\u201cI hope the House of Commons can get this done, without delay,\u201d he said, and the usual smirk broke out.\n\nHe can\u2019t help himself. He spent five years sitting in Brussels sitting in the press seats at press conferences. Now he is on the other side of the lectern, he knows well enough when words are exiting his lips that don\u2019t deserve to be treated with any credibility. It\u2019s almost honourable that he doesn\u2019t give them any credibility himself.\n\nFor the rest of the day, Brussels, Westminster and its swirling universe danced its usual dance.\n\nIf the House of Commons rejects the deal, what next? Would the EU allow an extension?\n\n\u201cWe have a deal. There is no need for a prolongation,\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker said, many times. It\u2019s not a \u201cno\u201d, and he knows it.\n\nWill enough Labour MPs be prepared to take the cover Juncker has given them, to take up the opportunity to kid themselves and others into saying out loud that it\u2019s this deal or no deal, and do Boris Johnson\u2019s bidding for him and, in his own wearisome phrase, \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s dimly possible, but unlikely. What happens then? An extension? A general election? A second referendum? Something like that, in some order or other. But all of these things are almost as hard for a hung parliament to make happen as a Brexit deal.\n\nJuncker, Varadkar, Tusk and Michel Barnier appeared later. All of them spoke with an air of finality \u2013 that Brexit is indeed done. \u201cBrexit has been a negative experience, a lose-lose process,\u201d Barnier said.\n\nPerhaps they really have had enough. Perhaps this really is it. But it seems unlikely.\n\nWhen Johnson finally appeared, at 7pm Brussels time, he spoke with almost a weary hope. \u201cThis process has been painful, at times,\u201d he said. Which it has, the pain caused by him.\n\nThere appears to be a hope that the country, via its MPs, can just be browbeaten into accepting the dismal future Johnson never actually thought it would be stupid enough to vote for.\n\nThe Brexit \u201cdeal\u201d he has done amounts to no more than a return to the offer rejected by Theresa May in 2018, to essentially keep Northern Ireland within the EU\u2019s economic structures after the rest of the UK leaves, with the earliest practical chance for it to change its mind coming in 2028.\n\nThe terms of Johnson\u2019s deal are essentially the same as the ones he took it upon himself, as a backbench MP, to fly to the DUP\u2019s conference in Belfast in 2018 and tell them, \u201cno British prime minister could ever sign up to\u201d.\n\nA year later, he asked them to agree to terms he had told them, a year previously, he could never sign up to himself. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s unsustainable.\n\n\u201cWhat I feel today is frankly speaking, sadness,\u201d said Donald Tusk, \u201cbecause in my heart I will always be a Remainer. And I hope that if our British friends decide to return one day, our door will always be open.\u201d\n\nIf this is indeed the end, certain realities will become clear, and fast.\n\nThree million European nationals live in the UK. They did not have the right to vote in the referendum.\n\nIt is a statement of fact that, whatever \u201cthe will of the people\u201d, as expressed one day in June 2016, if you walk down Britain\u2019s streets, use its public transport, or its schools, or its hospitals, you are in a country that, on balance, does not want Brexit to happen.\n\nIt is also a demographic reality that as age moves through the UK population, nostalgia for a world before 1975 diminishes.\n\n\u200bThere is also no credible economic analysis, anywhere, to show that Brexit will not make Britain poorer. Its economy will be smaller, its public transport, its schools, its hospitals will all be worse. These are facts that no amount of tedious bluster from Boris Johnson can counter.\n\nA country becoming poorer in the service of a goal in which it does not believe is not sustainable. Not in the long term, perhaps not even in the medium or short term.\n\nThe UK is still not out of that door. Should it ever be so, the chance of it remaining outside for the \u201cgenerations\u201d that are often spoken of seem tremendously unlikely.\n\nThere is, of course, a certain amount of shame that comes with having to admit you were taken in by Boris Johnson. But it is also the first step to recovering one\u2019s dignity. He knows better than anyone that everybody does it in the end.", "description": "On 6 May 1954, a young medical doctor called Roger Bannister ran four full laps of the Iffley Road track in Oxford in less time than it took for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal to die.
