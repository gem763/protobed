The two companies are the bedrock foundation for home mortgages in the U.S.\n\nThe government created them decades ago to provide a federally backed guarantee on loans to ensure that money would always be available for responsible, qualified homebuyers to get mortgages. They later became largely private companies but have been under government control since the financial crisis.\n\nNow the Trump administration says it wants to make Fannie and Freddie private companies again, make changes to the backstop they provide to the mortgage market, and introduce more competition from other private companies as well.\n\nMike Calhoun, the president of the nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending, worries such changes would drive up costs for borrowers and that the administration could impose new rules on homebuyers that would be too strict, for example requiring bigger down payments to qualify for a government backed mortgage.\n\n\"For working class Americans who want to buy a house this could make it much more difficult to get a mortgage and make the mortgage much more expensive,\" Calhoun says.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argues the plan will \"protect taxpayers and help Americans who want to buy a home.\" Mnuchin said in a statement, \"an effective and efficient Federal housing finance system will also meaningfully contribute to the continued economic growth under this Administration.\"\n\nWhatever happens next, it appears unlikely it will happen quickly. Parts of the plan would require approval by a divided Congress and Democrats will probably not embrace the administration's housing vision as a top priority.\n\nOther parts of the plan would not require congressional approval, including making Fannie and Freddie private companies again. They were seized during the Bush administration and put into what's known as government \"conservatorship\" as part of a roughly $190 billion bailout.\n\nBut the path to privatization is not clearly spelled out in the plan. The terms of the bailout were punishing. Essentially, all of Fannie and Freddie's profits have been flowing to the Treasury Department. And in recent years, their healthy profits have more than paid back the taxpayer money they received in the bailout.\n\nBut the companies are still required to keep handing over their profits to the government.\n\nIn order to function as private companies, Fannie and Freddie would have to be recapitalized, meaning they need billions and billions of dollars in cash. But the plan doesn't make clear which approach the administration would use to accomplish that goal. Some options floated in the plan would require congressional approval.\n\nThe administration also says in several places in its plan that it wants to avoid \"disruption\" in the mortgage market. And by definition, any abrupt changes involving Fannie and Freddie would be disruptive. Together the two firms backstop nearly half of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market.\n\nWith so much at stake, lawmakers, advocacy groups and industry lobbyists could very well fight over the details for months, or years to come.", "description": "The administration unveiled a plan to reprivatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that has lending advocates worried.
