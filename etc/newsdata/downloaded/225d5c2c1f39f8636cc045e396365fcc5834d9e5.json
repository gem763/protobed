The White House has offered no concrete evidence that Iran is to blame for the attacks. (Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels, who are fighting a Saudi coalition for survival in Yemen, claimed responsibility for the attack, though all indications are that the strike goes beyond their known capabilities.) But Trump\u2019s gauntlet was taken up almost reflexively by \u201cgrownups\u201d in Congress. \u201cThis may well be the thing that calls for military action against Iran, if that\u2019s what the intelligence supports,\u201d Delaware Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Fox & Friends viewers Monday morning.\n\nSeveral other congressional Democrats weighed in on social media to remind Trump that he\u2019d need legislative authorization for military action against Iran. The 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force has been used and abused by multiple presidents for misadventures the world over, and there\u2019s been absolutely no indication that congressional restraints\u2014or Americans\u2019 extremely low appetite for war right now\u2014matter to Trump when missiles are in play.\n\nWhat prevents American policymakers from quitting Saudi Arabia? Is it really just oil dependence? Is it the blood and treasure we\u2019ve sunk there since 2001? Or is it something else, perhaps the elite kinship Trump and his coterie of relatives feel with Mohammed bin Salman in his schemes to consolidate power? Put another way: What would it take for the U.S. to extract itself from Saudi military affairs?\n\n\n\n\n\nThese may not be the most important questions to ask today. Last week, when Trump unceremoniously dumped National Security Advisor John Bolton, arguably the biggest Iran hawk in the president\u2019s foreign policy entourage, I warned that the president\u2019s belligerence would grow more problematic, not less: \u201cForeign states and militant groups by now thoroughly understand the president\u2019s intellectual limitations and emotional needs; all it takes is one of these groups, in a highly tweetable crisis, to push Trump and his rhetoric into a place where he can\u2019t back down from them.\u201d\n\nNow, having tweeted that he\u2019s \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for war (a threat that amounted to nothing when he leveled it against North Korea), Trump is in a familiar position: Bomb or not? The Iranians, driven to desperation by U.S. sanctions and sensing an opportunity in the meltdown of the two nations\u2019 nuclear nonproliferation deal, now understand that Trump is a paper tiger with no coherent approach to them, or much else. He is painted into a corner. He can back down, as he always has, and accept that his bluster has no analog in reality. Or he can fight, and make losers of us all.", "description": "Why can\u2019t the United States quit Saudi Arabia?", "authors": ["Adam Weinstein"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e5bc7e7de4f7f0ad6ef09a10557f405bd5abbd6c.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
