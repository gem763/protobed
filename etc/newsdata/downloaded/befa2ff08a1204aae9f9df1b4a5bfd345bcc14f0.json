Even within this pantheon of paradigm-shifting style moments\u2014the stuff of swan dresses, princess pink gowns, and Cher\u2019s midriff\u2014nothing can really hold a candle to Jennifer Lopez in Versace at the 2000 Grammy Awards. The singer arrived wearing a plunge-front chiffon number in a tropical green floral that blew open when she walked, to the awe and delight of photographers, the audience, the nascent internet, and Lopez herself. \u201cIt was just one of those perfect moments,\u201d Lopez recently told Vogue, recollecting the red carpet turn that would vault her into the stratosphere of style.\n\nAt the time of the ceremony, Lopez was filming The Wedding Planner when her stylist, Andrea Lieberman, presented her with a selection of looks to wear to the Grammys. Nothing seemed right, and so she put off finding a dress until the day of the show. When Lieberman appeared with three dresses in tow, Lopez knew the green Versace was it\u2014even if it had already been worn by Geri Halliwell and Donatella Versace herself. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to wear; this is it,\u201d Lopez remembers telling her stylist. And so, d\u00e9colletage, abs, and legs on full display, the star hit the red carpet.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was all that risqu\u00e9, to be honest,\u201d she demurs. But the rest of the world did. That evening, Google searches for Lopez in the dress peaked so high it inspired Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and CEO Eric Schmidt to launch a photo search service, Google Images. \u201cThe dress was just provocative enough to make people interested,\u201d Lopez continues. \u201cThat was a moment that captured people\u2019s imaginations, I think . . . in terms of my career, this dress really marked a moment in time. Even if you don\u2019t know my music and you don\u2019t know my movies, people know about that moment and that dress. That was it.\u201d\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history\u2014but history can change. To mark the 20th anniversary of \u201cThe Dress,\u201d Lopez flew to Milan to walk Versace\u2019s Spring 2020 runway in a replica of her original look. See her hit the catwalk\u2014and reflect on 20 years as a Versace muse\u2014here.\n\nFilmed at the Lotte New York Palace\n\nDirector: Max Bartick\n\nDP: Emmanuella Zachariou\n\nDP, Milan: John Fisher\n\nAC: David Root\n\nSound: Tyler Postiglione\n\nSet designer: Javier Irigoyen\n\nProducer: Alyssa Marino\n\nProducer, Milan: James Graley\n\nAssociate producers: Sam Marine, Maya Solo\n\nEditors: Sam Norton, Tim Beeston, Theo Rosenthal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "After walking the Versace Spring 2020 runway in Milan, Jennifer Lopez gets real about the true story of her history-making dress.", "authors": ["Steff Yotka"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wxbEh77avrVbGae94fc8cQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/48df4b1c2b23403e757ba834c2e4b370", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
