Wheelchair ramps, solar charging wheelchairs, hot water bottles, accessible loos and accessible tents all languish in police storage, in an attempt to make disabled rebels lives so difficult that they leave the streets.\n\n\u2018When ten XR Disabled Rebels peacefully protested outside New Scotland Yard yesterday, demanding their stolen kit back \u2013 the police issued a section 14 and arrested the three remaining activists with over 20 officers.\n\nOne was arrested straight away and two wheelchair users a few hours later. One rebel remained at Scotland Yard. After an hour she needed some assistance from a carer. Both were then arrested because two counts as an assembly. None were aiming to do anything illegal, they weren\u2019t blocking anywhere and had no spray paint on them.\n\nA protester in a wheelchair talks to other protestors at a Disabled Rebels demonstration organised by Extinction Rebellion outside New Scotland Yard in London (Picture: Reuters)\n\nA spokesman from the Met earlier told Metro.co.uk he couldn\u2019t comment on specific charges, however said officers have the right to seize equipment they believe will facilitate unlawful protest and arrest those who break the law.\n\nHe said: \u2018It is the police\u2019s role is to provide a lawful and proportionate policing response to any planned protest, balancing the community impact with the right to protest.\n\n\u2018Officers have powers to seize any equipment which they believe will facilitate unlawful protest. This forms part of our robust, proportionate policing plan which we continue to keep under review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If protesters break the law, officers will look to arrest those people.\n\n\u2018Furthermore, those people can expect to be charged, prosecuted, and receive a criminal record.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
