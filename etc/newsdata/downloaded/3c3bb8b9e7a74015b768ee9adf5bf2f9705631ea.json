I kid, I kid, but unfortunately the cycle\u2019s biggest disappointment isn\u2019t joking. Kamala Harris practically had the red carpet laid out for her when she entered the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, including a move by her home state to go early in the voting process. Instead of catching fire, Harris wasted a momentary polling burst in the early summer and now polls routinely in the second tier or below.\n\nHarris has an explanation for that, which is as ridiculous as it is predictable:\n\nDiscussing her campaign with \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d, Kamala Harris says electability is the \u201celephant in the room\u201d, questioning whether America is ready for a woman \u2014 and a woman of color \u2014 to be president. pic.twitter.com/vykBmAvIhL \u2014 Axios (@axios) October 28, 2019\n\nThe \u201celephant in the room\u201d for Harris is her incompetence at closing the deal. It\u2019s absurd to be talking about racism as her biggest obstacle when Harris can\u2019t even get into double digits in the same state that elected her to the Senate. California maneuvered itself to the front of the primary pack, which all but handed Harris a boatload of delegates if she just managed to remain competitive in the Golden State. Instead, it\u2019s been nearly two months since she last hit double digits in California, and almost four months since she last polled higher than fourth place. In the most recent KQED/NPR poll in the state, Harris finished fifth, slightly behind a gay mayor from South Bend, Indiana who arguably doesn\u2019t much resemble the previous 45 presidents in terms of identity either.\n\nNow, Harris has won statewide elections in California three times \u2014 in 2010 and 2014 as attorney general, and then in 2016 to the US Senate. Harris barely won in her first election 46/45 in a six-way race, but got 56% on her re-election bid four years later and then 61.6% in her win to the US Senate \u2014 over a Hispanic Democrat, thanks to California\u2019s all-in primary system. Are we to conclude that Californians only recently found out that Harris is a \u201cwoman of color\u201d?\n\nFor this claim, Harris presents a single, solitary anecdote for support \u2014 and it\u2019s from nearly twelve years ago. When the Axios interviewer reminds Harris that Barack Obama won two terms in office from the same supposedly racist/bigoted electorate, Harris relates a conversation she had in the run-up to the 2008 Iowa caucuses in which an elderly black woman told her that \u201cthey aren\u2019t going to let him win.\u201d Except, of course, Obama won the 2008 Iowa caucuses with 32% of the vote, well ahead of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 25%, and won Iowa in the general election over John McCain 54/45.\n\nOne also has to wonder at the long-range strategy behind tossing this race/gender card at Democratic voters. After all, Harris isn\u2019t out campaigning for Republican votes at this stage. When she claims that \u201cthere is a lack of ability or difficulty in imagining\u201d that a woman of color can be president, Harris is making that claim about the Democrats who are stampeding away from her candidacy and toward Warren, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and even Pete Buttigieg.\n\nCan Harris win a Democratic presidential primary by calling its voters racists and bigots? Almost certainly not, but it will be hilariously fun to watch her try.", "description": "Showing her cards.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/harris-axios.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
