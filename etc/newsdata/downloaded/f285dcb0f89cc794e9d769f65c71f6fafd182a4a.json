REUTERS/Patrick Doyle/File Photo\n\nBecause of economic growth, the deficit could climb to about C$30 billion over the next election cycle without increasing debt as a share of gross domestic product, the government\u2019s preferred fiscal anchor, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nThe March federal budget projected that nominal GDP growth would slow to 3.4% this year but then climb steadily to 4% in 2023.\n\nA deficit of as much as C$30 billion \u201cwould not generate unmanageable debt service charges,\u201d said David Dodge, senior advisor at Bennett Jones and former Governor of the Bank of Canada. \u201cIf interest rates go down further you have a little bit more room.\u201d\n\nLiberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is banking on it. His promises ahead of the Oct. 21 federal election would raise the deficit to C$27.4 billion in the first year, Trudeau said on Sunday, with debt as a percentage of output remaining on a downward trajectory.\n\nOn Monday, financial markets were unfazed by the potential deficit increase. The Canadian dollar was the second strongest performing G10 currency, after sterling, while the gap between Canada\u2019s 10-year yield and its U.S. equivalent was unchanged at a spread of 31.5 basis points in favor of the U.S. bond.\n\nConservative Party leader Andrew Scheer on Monday criticized Trudeau\u2019s plan, saying it was reckless and would lead to \u201cmassive tax hikes\u201d, but he is in no hurry to balance the budget either. Scheer says he\u2019ll close the budget gap in five years if elected.\n\nTrudeau and Scheer are running in a tight race, with a Nanos poll published on Monday putting the Conservatives at 34% nationally compared with 32.7% for the Liberals.\n\nCanada is one of a few countries with an undisputed triple A credit rating. At less than 31%, its federal debt-to-GDP ratio is low compared to some G7 peers, while its borrowing costs are lower than for the United States.\n\nThe Government of Canada 10-year yield was 1.37% on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt is ultimately about the sustainability of public debt and as long as the economy is growing then it is not necessary to balance the budget in order to have public debt on a sustainable path,\u201d said Charles Seville, a senior director at Fitch Ratings.\n\nCanada\u2019s smaller parties have also made fiscal promises worth billions of dollars. Only 3.5% of Canadians say the debt or deficit is the top concern, according to pollster Nanos Research.\n\n\u201cAt the time where there isn\u2019t the political will or will among the population or even consensus among economists that the government should be balancing the budget it would seem stupid to focus on that,\u201d said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.\n\nAdditional government spending could relieve pressure on Canada\u2019s heavily-indebted households and help support the country\u2019s immigration-led growth.\n\n\u201cYou should really be investing in providing the infrastructure for those people coming to the country. They need that for the next 60 years ... each year they will pay more taxes as they come,\u201d Brown said.", "description": "Canada's candidates are making a range of pricey campaign promises ahead of October's vote, but a former central bank governor and ratings agencies see wiggle room for a larger budget shortfall so long as the economy continues to grow.", "authors": ["Fergal Smith", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435596492&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T16J-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
