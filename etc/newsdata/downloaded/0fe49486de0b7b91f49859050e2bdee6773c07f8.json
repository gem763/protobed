We are aware of the interest in converting this property to a QT, and look forward to further discussion with the owners.\u201d\n\nSt Kilda revival\n\nMr Jeffs, whose first job when he moved to Melbourne in 1999 was to manage the Novotel in St Kilda \u2013 now the site for Tim Gurner's St Moritz luxury development \u2013 said it was sad to see what had become of the beachside suburb.\n\n\"It's such a vibrant place. It should be one of the best destinations in Melbourne,\" he said.\n\nMr Jeffs said he was confident the Gurner project and other reinvestment happening in the area, including the $15 million makeover of the famed Esplanade Hotel, would help drive a revival of St Kilda.\n\n\"We'd also like to do something in the Melbourne CBD,\" said Mr Jeffs.\n\n\"Even with the supply coming into Melbourne \u2013 7000 rooms over the next four years \u2013 having a hotel in the right location is key,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Erdi Group was founded in the mid-1980s by Hungarian migrant Les Erdi. It owns six hotels with just under 1000 rooms.\n\nIncluded in the portfolio is the 200-room Grand Mercure at 196 Swanston Street adjacent to Bourke Street Mall, which as the Club One Hotel was the first hotel developed by Mr Erdi and his wife Eva in the 1980s.\n\nMost recently, it underwent a $30 million interior makeover from the Grand Mercure to Accor's more upmarket Pullman brand.\n\nOther hotels in the portfolio include the Novotel Geelong and the 330-room Mercure Welcome Melbourne on Little Bourke Street.\n\nMr Erdi passed away in 2013 and his wife Eva in 2016. Both were in their nineties.\n\nThe Erdi Group is now operated by a board, including Mr Jeffs, with all its profits funnelled into the philanthropic Erdi Foundation, which supports charitable events and organisations in Australia and Israel.", "description": "The new QT hotel will replace the dated Rydges Hotel on Fitzroy Street, currently battling high vacancy rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1212%2C$y_419/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7c513237a3cd43453987b06ba50be9bc351ca237", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
