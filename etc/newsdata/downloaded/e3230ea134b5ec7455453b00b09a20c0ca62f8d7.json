Consider: When the film begins, a drumroll kicks off the familiar 20th Century Fox opening fanfare, and you'll think \u2014 for about one second \u2014 that all's normal. But as the Fox searchlights sweep the sky, the drums and horns turn into what sounds like a German drinking song, sung by children.\n\nShortly after, we see images of Nazi soldiers saluting the F\u00fchrer as the Beatles sing \"Komm Gib Mir Deine Hand.\"\n\nWe're in 1944 Berlin, where 10-year-old Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is having a rough first day of Nazi Summer Camp, and being consoled by an imaginary friend whose toothbrush moustache and swastika'd uniform clearly identify him \u2014 though this is a much cheerier, chummier Adolf Hitler than the one you'd recognize from newsreels.\n\nAs played by writer-director Taika Waititi, this imaginary F\u00fchrer is a nice guy \u2014 which makes sense, as he's a figment of the imagination of a nice 10-year-old.\n\nAs setups go, Jojo Rabbit's treatment of history's most reviled mass murderer qualifies as ... unusual ... though hardly unprecedented: Charlie Chaplin played a Hitler-like Adenoid Hynkel in The Great Dictator, when the real Hitler was still around. Mel Brooks mocked him after World War II in The Producers, Quentin Tarantino created a revenge fantasy in Inglorious Basterds. So Waititi's not treading new ground here, just offering a new take.\n\nHis comic idea is much like Chaplin's: to deconstruct fascist thinking. He makes little Jojo a propaganda-fed child so innocent that he's never learned to tie his shoes, then helps him to puzzle out the dense network of lies that surrounds him.\n\nAssisting with both the shoelaces and the life-lessons is his mom, played by Scarlett Johansson. Also on hand is Sam Rockwell as Jojo's camp counselor, who's aware that the Nazi jig is up, but plans to dance it away.\n\nAnd there's a Jewish girl hiding in the attic, played by Thomasin McKensie, who not-so-gently challenges the notions he's built his young life on. \"You're not a Nazi, Jojo,\" she says, \"you're a 10-year-old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club.\"\n\nJojo Rabbit is gently comic for a while, and then surprisingly affecting at the end, so perhaps it's not fair to wish that Waititi had opted to deal more directly with the horrors of the Third Reich. We are, after all, living in a time when fascism is again a growing threat.\n\nNot what he was going for, though \u2014 he's content to sidestep the atrocities, concentrate on the indoctrination of children, and let his young hero \u2014 and by proxy, the audience \u2014 learn life lessons that get tied up, like a child's shoelace, with a neat little bow.\n\n", "description": "Taika Waititi writes, directs \u2014 and stars, as a 10-year-old boy's imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler \u2014 in this very silly film about a very serious subject.", "authors": ["Bob Mondello"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/15/jojo-rabbit-010_jrr_rgb_wide-d3a9bb534c579daac48ec9f107014c54ec679b73.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
