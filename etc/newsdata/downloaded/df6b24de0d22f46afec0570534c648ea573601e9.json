This is good. Honestly one of the more surprising things about this is that My Chemical Romance hasn\u2019t been more of a mainstay in Triple J\u2019s roster of Like A Version tunes. But thank god that long wait is finally over, and thank god for Alex Lahey.\n\nMelbourne-based Lahey casually strolled into Aunty\u2019s studios earlier this morning and tore the Government-funded broadcaster a new one with a full-throttle version of MCR\u2019s beyond-iconic scream-your-guts-out hit Welcome To The Black Parade.\n\n\u2018Course you can\u2019t exactly fit a full orchestral backing band in the Triple J studio \u2013 much less the small room \u2013 but with three guitars and a bonus little G-Flip bashing some timpanis and rattling the big cymbals it goes bloody close.\n\nTime to fire up, folks. This one\u2019s a bloody BELTER.\n\nDeadset, G-Flip looking like she\u2019s having the time of her dang life smashing out those shoo-bops almost steals the show.\n\nAlmost.\n\nIs it possible to do a whole album front-to-back as your Like A Version? Because now I want Lahey to do Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge cover to cover.\n\nAs soon as possible, if you please.\n\nThanks in advance.", "description": "Correcting an egregious wrong, Alex Lahey finally put My Chemical Romance into the Like A Version lexicon by covering Welcome To The Black Parade.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/alex-lahey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
