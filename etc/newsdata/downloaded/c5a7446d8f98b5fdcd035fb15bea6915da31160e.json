REUTERS/Ricardo Arduengo\n\nThe so-called plan of adjustment covering $35 billion of bonds and claims and more than $50 billion of pension liabilities would allow Puerto Rico to exit a form of bankruptcy that commenced in May 2017 if it wins U.S. District Court approval.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of the end of Puerto Rico\u2019s bankruptcy process,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Carri\u00f3n, chairman of the oversight board, told reporters following a public hearing on the plan.\n\nThe proposal, which would reduce the value of bonds and other claims, won the support of Puerto Rico\u2019s new governor even though it calls for pension cuts for about 40% of the island\u2019s government retirees.\n\nConfirmation of the plan by U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is hearing Puerto Rico\u2019s bankruptcy cases, is expected in the first half of 2020, according to Natalie Jaresko, the board\u2019s executive director.\n\nCHALLENGES AHEAD\n\nBut Puerto Rico faces \u201can uphill battle,\u201d according to James Spiotto, managing director of Chapman Strategic Advisors, who pointed to the proposal\u2019s relatively low support among creditors compared with plan of adjustment filings in previous high-profile municipal bankruptcies.\n\n\u201cIf enough people don\u2019t accept it, how\u2019s the plan going to be feasible?\u201d he said.\n\nPlan support agreements cover $4 billion of bonds so far, up from $3 billion when an initial deal was announced in June, according to the board.\n\nAssured Guaranty, which insures nearly $1.5 billion of Puerto Rico general obligation and Public Buildings Authority (PBA) bonds, said it does not support the plan \u201cas it is premised on a number of terms that violate Puerto Rico law, its constitution and PROMESA,\u201d the 2016 U.S. law that created the oversight board.\n\nJaresko said the board will continue to negotiate with other creditor groups to increase support.\n\nOwners of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, the PBA and Employees Retirement System would face losses on their initial investments ranging from 28% to 87%, with higher reductions earmarked for bonds that the board and some creditors are seeking to invalidate.\n\nThe board is trying to void more than $6 billion of general obligation bonds sold in 2012 and 2014 on the basis they were issued in violation of Puerto Rico\u2019s constitutional debt limit. The proposed plan of adjustment contains a settlement offer for challenged bonds, while postponing litigation on the validity of the debt until after the plan is confirmed in court.\n\nAnnual debt service would be reduced to 9% of government revenue from 28%, according to the board.\n\nPENSION CUTS CONTROVERSY\n\nThe plan creates an independent reserve trust for Puerto Rico\u2019s pay-as-you-go public sector retirement system and calls for a maximum 8.5% pension cut for retirees who receive more than $1,200 in monthly benefits. A federal court-appointed committee representing more than 167,000 retirees has agreed to the plan.\n\nOther groups that represent pensioners such as the Teachers Federation and the Government Retirees and Pensioners Federation rejected the proposal, noting that the court-appointed committee does not represent them in the negotiations\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBefore former Governor Ricardo Rossello left office last month and was eventually replaced by Wanda Vazquez, Puerto Rico\u2019s government opposed pension cuts.\n\nIn a televised address, Vazquez said while she opposes cuts to pensioners in principle, her administration will support the proposed plan of adjustment to avoid risking stiffer pension cuts and \u201closing the opportunity to restructure more than $35 billion in commonwealth debt.\u201d\n\nSo far, Puerto Rico has received court approval for debt restructurings for its Government Development Bank and Sales Tax Financing Corporation known as COFINA. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority moved closer to exiting bankruptcy earlier this month when two holdout bond insurers joined a deal to restructure its debt.", "description": "Puerto Rico would reduce a major portion of its debt by more than 60% under a long-awaited restructuring proposal the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth's federally created financial oversight board filed in court on Friday.", "authors": ["Luis Valentin Ortiz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434698011&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q204", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
