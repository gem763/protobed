REUTERS/Chris Wattie\n\nShares of HEXO Corp. (HEXO.TO)(HEXO) plunged more than 20 per cent in on Thursday after the Canadian cannabis producer warned of weaker sales and pulled its financial guidance for fiscal 2020.\n\nThe Gatineau, Que.-based company is blaming \u201clower-than-expected product sell-through,\u201d and now expects net sales for the fourth quarter to be between $14.5 million and $16.5 million, and net sales for the year to be approximately $46.5 million to $48.5 million.\n\nIn June, HEXO reported $13 million in net sales for its fiscal third quarter ended April 20. The company said at the time it was on track to double that figure in Q4 of 2019. HEXO issued guidance of up to $400 million in net revenue in its 2020 financial year.\n\n\u201cWithdrawing our outlook for fiscal year 2020 has been a difficult decision,\u201d chief executive officer Sebastien St-Louis said in a news release on Thursday. \u201cGiven the uncertainties in the marketplace, we have determined that it is the appropriate course of action.\u201d\n\nThe move follows the abrupt resignation of chief financial officer Michael Monahan on Friday. Monahan said he left the company for personal reasons.\n\nHEXO said the slower-than-expected rollout of retail stores, government delays for derivative products, and \u201cearly signs of pricing pressure\u201d that are being felt nationally added to the company\u2019s decision to revoke previously issued financial guidance.\n\nCrowdsourced data from Statistics Canada showed the price for a gram of legal cannabis fell for the first time in the third quarter. A number of industry observers have predicted prices received by licensed producers will decline into 2020, prompting discounts at \u2018mid-range\u2019 flower at retail stores. Analysts are also raising concerns about supply glut in provincial warehouses and harvest levels that outstrip legal sales.\n\nSt-Louis said that over the past quarter Hexo has began \"re-configuring our operations\" to focus on high-selling strains and initiated a new sales strategy.\n\n\u201cWe are also placing a greater focus on profitability,\u201d St-Louis added. \u201cWe are evaluating our plans and operations to see where we can be even more efficient.\u201d\n\nBeacon Securities analyst Russell Stanley downgraded HEXO shares to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d and slashed his price target to $4 from $14 on Thursday.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding our downgrade, it is worth noting that HEXO\u2019s balance sheet remains strong,\u201d he wrote in a research note. \u201cEven based on our revised estimates, which contemplate considerable investments in working capital as sales improve, our forecast shows that HEXO has ample balance sheet capacity to support its growth.\u201d\n\nMatt Bottomley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, cut his price target to $7 from $10 and maintains a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock. He was surprised by the magnitude of HEXO\u2019s expected fourth-quarter revenue miss, but not the suspension of full-year 2020 guidance.\n\n\u201cWe believe HEXO\u2019s planned capacity and leading position in Quebec make achieving these levels technically possible. However, hurdles independent of the company (lack of retail stores, legislation of additional product forms) are increasingly being noted by all LPs,\u201d he wrote in a research note. \u201cThis view is now being echoed by HEXO management.\u201d\n\nToronto-listed shares fell 23.16 per cent to $3.75 at 2:50 p.m. ET. New York-listed shares declined 23.68 per cent to $2.80.\n\nThe company is set to report fourth-quarter and year-end financial results before markets open on Oct. 24.\n\nYahoo Finance Canada More\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "description": "Shares of HEXO plunged more than 20 per cent after the Canadian cannabis producer warned of weaker sales and pulled its financial guidance for fiscal 2020.", "authors": ["Jeff Lagerquist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J4qR6_NOJStKmaQdhE9IZw--~B/aD00MDgzO3c9NjEyMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/dffadc40-eb63-11e9-b4ff-94908bce0a3b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
