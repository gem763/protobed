'She\u2019s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience.'\n\nJohn Legend said Elizabeth Warren is his favorite 2020 presidential candidate and Chrissy Teigen confessed she loves her too\n\nLegend said about Elizabeth Warren: 'She\u2019s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience'\n\n'I also love Kamala Harris,' Teigen, 33, said about the California Democrat Senator\n\nIt prompted Teigen to chime in that she too adores Warren but is torn between her and another female Senator, this one from their home state California.\n\n'I love Elizabeth Warren. I also love Kamala Harris,' Teigen, 33, said.\n\nBut Legend, 40, made it clear he doesn't believe other men would vote for a woman to run the country, even if they thought they made the better candidate.\n\nIt's something the father-of-two struggles to get his head around.\n\n'Honestly, I don\u2019t comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes,' Legend told the magazine.\n\n'You see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?'\n\nIn the profile, Teigen whispered jokingly in response: 'Our menses. Because there\u2019s 10 days a month where we\u2019re just going to war.'\n\nBut Legend, 40, made it clear in the December issue of Vanity Fair that he doesn't believe other men would vote for a woman to run the country\n\nIt's sure to rile up Trump who has continuously referred to Warren as 'Pocahontas' in reference to her claiming to have native American roots.\n\nTrump has also lashed out at Legend and Teigen as they criticize his policies.\n\nLast week Legend said about the president: 'He\u2019s a despicable human being, and he says sh***y things all the time.\n\n'(He's) just a sh****y person. Every day he's the opposite of what you would want your child to be.'\n\nThe screen star was speaking during 'Legend Has It: Activism and Influence in the Age of Trump' at Vanity Fair's 6th Annual New Establishment Summit in Beverly Hills.\n\nHis reaction was to Trump comparing the impeachment process to a lynching.\n\nPrior to that Trump attacked the singer-and-actor on Twitter after Legend, the founder criminal justice reform awareness organization, FREEAMERICA, appeared on Lester Holt's NBC Nightly News September 8.\n\n'When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help. I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn\u2019t come close,' Trump began tweeting.\n\n'A man named @VanJones68 and many others, were profusely grateful (at that time!). I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. Guys like boring.....\n\n'....musician @johnlegend and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. \u201cAnchor\u201d@LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about...'\n\nTeigen and Legend have been very outspoken about their dislike for Donald Trump, who reportedly sees Warren as a serious rival for the White House in 2020 and has targeted her in his rally speeches\n\nLast week Legend said about the president at 'Legend Has It: Activism and Influence in the Age of Trump' at Vanity Fair's 6th Annual New Establishment Summit: 'He\u2019s a despicable human being, and he says sh***y things all the time'\n\nLegend endorsed Warren in the Vanity Fair profile after discussing what Teigen has called Trump's Twitter 'meltdown'.\n\n'We know this president has a particular aversion to strong women coming after him, particularly women of color,' Legend told the publication about his wife. 'So he had to call her out. Every time he does something like this, he just makes himself look more terrible. I don\u2019t know that that incrementally convinces anyone not to vote for him, but he just proves himself to be a sh***y human being.'\n\nLegend took the interview opportunity to empower Teigen, telling the publication how at an Obama Foundation event in Oakland this year he and the 44th president 'joked about how much our wives are loved more than we are now'.\n\nLaughing about their prospects of gaining the White House Teigen put a stop to any serious consideration by noting her career highlights.\n\n'Uh, I did Sports Illustrated and covered my boobs with a leaf,' Teigen interjected.\n\n'But hasn\u2019t Melania opened the door for anyone to be a first lady?' Legend said in another jab at the Trumps. 'The biggest issue about this presidency is how they\u2019ve just lowered standards for everything. Hopefully we\u2019ll reset?'\n\nWhile his music industry friend Kanye West has showed support for Trump as has his wife Kim Kardashian who urged him to make change in the criminal justice reform system, he believes the rapper was coming from non-political angle.\n\n'I think what was always challenging about it was Kanye has never been political,' Legend opened up. 'I don\u2019t think he knows one way or another what policies of Trump\u2019s he likes. He just kind of embraced Trump\u2019s blow-it-all-up spirit and the energy of himself being countercultural in supporting him.'\n\nLegend said about Kanye West: 'I don\u2019t think he knows one way or another what policies of Trump\u2019s he likes. He just kind of embraced Trump\u2019s blow-it-all-up spirit'\n\nTeigen rated Kim Kardashian for what she describes as being 'able to go in there and put whatever you hate about him aside to do this greater good' and said she's not sure if she could smile and shake Trump's hand herself\n\nTeigen rated Kardashian for what she describes as being 'able to go in there and put whatever you hate about him aside to do this greater good' as the reality star got clemency granted for some cases she helped made more high profile.\n\nTeigen hinted it's unlikely she'll be on civil terms with Trump soon: 'I don\u2019t know if I could physically muster that smile and handshake.'\n\nLegend warned that Trump's celebrity connections shouldn't overshadow the harm he's simultaneously doing.\n\n'It\u2019s a cheap win for [Trump],' Legend continued. 'But the people being granted clemency are real people with families. So even if the clemency is won through his celebrity-whore tendencies, it\u2019s still helpful for that family and that person. At the same time, he\u2019s locking kids in cages and he\u2019s a terrible human being....'\n\nTeigen appeared to agree that Trump's over-the-top approach has been distracting. She added that she thinks he indeed is let off lightly for his wrongdoings.\n\n'I think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,' Teigen said. 'I feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office. I know that his first tweet after he\u2019s impeached will be, \"I didn\u2019t want to be there anyway\".'", "description": "Chrissy Teigen admitted: 'I love Elizabeth Warren.
