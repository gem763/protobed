Kamala Harris (D-CA) signed a petition that has been circulating among students and staff at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), which smears the conservative student organization, Turning Point USA.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply alarmed by your administration\u2019s inadequate response to the presence and impacts of Turning Point USA (TPUSA) on our campus,\u201d read a petition addressed to UNR president Marc Johnson, claiming that the university president has failed to \u201cfully support students who organize anti-racist speech, protest, and action.\u201d\n\nThe petition, entitled, Concerning white nationalism on the University of Nevada, Reno campus, smears TPUSA \u2014 which recently hosted its annual Black Leadership Summit \u2014 as a group that is engaging in \u201cwhite nationalist tactics.\u201d\n\nAmong the signers of the petition includes \u201cKamala Harris, Presidential Candidate,\u201d who visited UNR\u2019s campus earlier this month.\n\nThe petition goes on to accuse the university of \u201cthe lack of commitment to systemic transformation of the racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic atmosphere on campus,\u201d and specifically cites dismay over the arrests of one student, Edsel Bester, who was apprehended by police and taken to the Washoe County Jail after targeting TPUSA members on campus.\n\nThe arrests of a UNR student who brought a sign reading \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d to the UNR stadium, and who argued with campus TPUSA members and knocked over their display table. Both arrests were carried out by the Reno Police Department with no apparent attempt to resolve conflict through campus resources, and no communication with the campus community.\n\n\u201cTPUSA is waging a campaign to recruit students at colleges and universities nationwide. They have significantly increased their activity over the past years and months,\u201d states the petition, which goes on to vilify TPUSA by attempting to conflate the organization with anti-capitalist and white nationalist groups \u2014 all of which have no affiliation with TPUSA.\n\nStudent members of UNR\u2019s TPUSA group expressed shock and concern over now finding themselves targeted by leftists on campus.\n\n\u201cNo one ever talked to us, so they would never know who we are actually,\u201d said one UNR TPUSA member to Breitbart News. \u201cWe all have strong moral characters. This is why it\u2019s so upsetting \u2014 we all come from a good place in our hearts.\u201d\n\nThe petition goes on to proclaim that \u201cracist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric\u201d may eventually \u201cescalate into physical violence, including gun violence\u201d on campus.\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is crucial to prevent an established pattern of intimidation from escalating further,\u201d states the petition.\n\nSome may argue, however, that \u201can established pattern of intimidation\u201d might involve white leftists attempting to silence black conservative and TPUSA regional manager Richard Mills \u2014 just days after Bester was arrested for targeting TPUSA members in what was a separate incident on campus.\n\nMost conservatives agree black lives matter\u2014 even if we disagree with the divisive movement named after the same statement. When I joined @unevadareno protestors in agreement of that statement, two white leftists prevented me, a black man, from doing so. How is that not racist? pic.twitter.com/NSNuOd26yS \u2014 Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cMost conservatives agree black lives matter \u2014 even if we disagree with the divisive movement named after the same statement,\u201d tweeted Mills, which included a video of the incident. \u201cWhen I joined [UNR] protestors in agreement of that statement, two white leftists prevented me, a black man, from doing so. How is that not racist?\u201d\n\nWhile speaking at UNR last week, TPUSA founder and executive director Charlie Kirk addressed the smears targeting his organization on campus.\n\n\u201cI want to make something very, very clear \u2014 the evil, wicked ideology of white supremacy has no place in our organization. We repudiate it, we reject it wholeheartedly and completely, as should any decent American,\u201d said Kirk, which elicited a response of cheers and applause from TPUSA members and fans in the audience.\n\nA TPUSA spokesperson told Breitbart News in a phone interview that Sen. Harris \u201cis either incredibly ignorant or wildly reckless to sign a document that places a mainstream organization like Turning Point USA in the same breath as hate or bigotry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not only defamatory, but it endangers the many patriots and amazing young people that are a part of UNR\u2019s TPUSA chapter \u2014 who represent all backgrounds, genders, skin colors \u2014 putting them at risk of doxing, physical harm, and harassment, all because Senator Harris failed to reflect the truth by signing such a fallacious petition.\u201d\n\nThe concerns raised by TPUSA are not unfounded, given that leftists at the University of Texas at Austin \u2014 who have doxed pro-Kavanaugh students \u2014 also threatened to dox incoming fall 2019 freshmen students seeking to get involved with the conservative student organization.\n\n\u201cTPUSA would welcome the opportunity to speak face-to-face with Senator Harris \u2014 particularly with the leaders of our young Black Leadership Summit or Latino Leadership Summit, who are directly impacted by the senator\u2019s actions \u2014 so that she can understand what our organization is for, and what it is against,\u201d added the TPUSA spokesperson.\n\n\u201cNamely, TPUSA is against all forms of hate, racism, and bigotry,\u201d affirmed the spokesperson. \u201cWe should stand united on these issues.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Democrat presidential candidate and Sen.
