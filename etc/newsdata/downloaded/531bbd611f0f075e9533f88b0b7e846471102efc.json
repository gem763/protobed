Biden, the current front-runner among candidates campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, according to a rough transcript of the conversation released by the White House.\n\nDemocrats leading the impeachment probe are examining whether Mr. Trump made the request while leveraging millions of dollars in assistance already earmarked by Congress for Ukraine, in addition to whether the White House tried to keep details about the call under wraps.\n\nMr. Pompeo listened live as the phone call between the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents took place, he confirmed earlier this week.\n\nCommenting on the impeachment proceedings during the press conference Saturday, Mr. Pompeo said \u201cthere is clearly politics involved in this\u201d and added that the Trump administration was \u201d incredibly focused on making sure that we worked with Ukraine in a way that was appropriate.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
