Revolution of our age!\u2019 at the end of a stream, which got not only him suspended but also the people in charge of the stream \u2013 who literally hid under a table during his comments.\n\nAccording to Blizzard this violates an existing competition rule about doing anything that might bring competitors into \u2018public disrepute\u2019 or which \u2018offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image\u2019.\n\nin a post-match Hearthstone Grandmasters winning interview, Hong Kong HS player @blitzchungHS said \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!\" in response, Blizzard Taiwan has now deleted the VOD from their official Twitch channel https://t.co/l5lcMu4ULR \u2014 Rod Breslau (@Slasher) October 7, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, Ng Wai has been thrown out of the Grandmasters, has been banned from Hearthstone esports for 12 months, and has had all of his prize money withheld.\n\n\u2018While we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules\u2019, said Blizzard in statement.\n\nBlizzard then went on to disable all comments on the news story on their site, which they never normally do.\n\nThe reasons are obvious, in that Blizzard doesn\u2019t want to do anything to offend mainland China, in terms of either players or the government.\n\nThe fact that it was on a Taiwanese channel would have made things particularly difficult, especially after Taiwanese-made horror game Devotion was review bombed by Chinese gamers earlier in the year.\n\nThat led to it being pulled from Steam worldwide, merely for having a Winnie Pooh meme hidden in an obscure part of the game.\n\nBreaking: Effective immediately, Blizzard has removed Hong Kong Hearthstone player blitzchung from Hearthstone Grand Masters, rescinded all his prize money, and have suspended him from pro play for one year for his recent interview.
