That\u2019s why I was so disappointed to see him resort to a cheap stunt during last week\u2019s debate.\n\nI assumed that having earned his way into the first debate where all the candidates would share the same stage at the same time, Yang would seize this moment to explain the core issue that has propelled his candidacy.\n\nIn case you missed it (and you wouldn\u2019t have seen it during the debate!), Yang\u2019s fundamental message is that a lot of working-class Americans have been left behind, and the culprit is automation. This problem, Yang insists, is going to get much more pervasive. Like the Industrial Revolution, it will lead to tremendous dislocation and disruption.", "description": "The outsider candidate is trying to warn us about the dangers of automation.
