(Burhan Ozbilici/AP)\n\nTurkey\u2019s vice president said Tuesday that his country would \u201cnot react to threats,\u201d as it prepared to mount a military offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria, a day after President Trump warned that he would destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if the offensive did not meet with his approval.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the security of Turkey, as always, our president emphasized Turkey will determine its own path,\u201d the vice president, Fuat Oktay, said in a speech at a university in Ankara, the Turkish capital. He referred to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has vowed to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in a lengthy swath of Syrian territory along Turkey\u2019s border.\n\nErdogan and other Turkish officials have suggested for days that the military operation could begin at any moment. Turkish troop convoys have headed to the border, and local media outlets have published details of what they say is the battle plan. Turkey\u2019s Defense Ministry wrote Tuesday on Twitter that all its preparations for the operation were complete.\n\n[Syrian Kurds see U.S. betrayal and warn fight against ISIS is now in doubt]\n\nBut there was no sign yet that Turkish troops were moving forward, as the United Nations and aid agencies warned of potentially catastrophic humanitarian consequences, and as the Trump administration delivered confusing signals about how it views Turkey\u2019s plans to attack a Syrian-Kurdish force that partnered with the U.S. military to fight the Islamic State militant group.\n\nIn a White House statement on Sunday and tweets on Monday, Trump suggested that U.S. troops would step aside as Turkey conducted its military operation.\n\n\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebel fighters head to an area near the Syrian-Turkish border north of Aleppo on Oct. 8, 2019.

Dozens of U.S. troops were withdrawn from the \u201csafe zone\u201d early Monday.\n\nBut after facing harsh criticism from some of his own allies that he was abandoning the Syrian Kurds, Trump appeared to have a change of heart by Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey,\u201d he wrote, without specifying what was off limits.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials, frozen in Turkey\u2019s crosshairs, tried to seize on Washington\u2019s political divisions.\n\n\u201cWe are humbled by the enormous support by American people and politicians despite @potus decision to pave the way for Turkish invasion, which caused despair among people,\u201d Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian-Kurdish force, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), wrote Tuesday on Twitter.\n\n[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria angers, worries Europeans]\n\nU.S. officials have denied that Trump endorsed a Turkish invasion. A senior administration official said Monday that Trump\u2019s principal concern was the safety of U.S. troops operating in the area. \u201cThe president has made it very clear there should be no untoward action with respect to the Kurds or anyone else,\u201d the official said.\n\nAs allies and regional actors tried to unscramble Trump\u2019s conflicting statements, Erdogan\u2019s government has remained on message, insisting that the invasion is a certainty and that its target, the SDF, is an imminent threat to national security because of its ties to Kurdish militants in Turkey.\n\nThe establishment of the safe zone \u201cis essential for the stability and peace of our region and for Syrians to be reunited with a secure life,\u201d the Turkish Defense Ministry said in a tweet on Tuesday. The ministry was alluding to Erdogan\u2019s plan to resettle in Syria millions of Syrian refugees now residing in Turkey \u2014 a mass repatriation that the United Nations and refugee advocates have said might violate international law.\n\nEric Schwartz, president of Refugees International, said in a statement Monday that Turkey\u2019s proposed resettlement in the \u201csafe zone\u201d was \u201cshockingly irresponsible.\u201d And Ankara\u2019s proposed invasion would likely create new refugees, he added.\n\n[Republicans deliver rare rebuke of Trump, slamming his Syria withdrawal decision]\n\n\u201cIt could displace hundreds of thousands of civilians in an area already in the grip of a humanitarian crisis,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cA Turkish military operation into northeast Syria will likely force international relief groups to evacuate just when they are needed most.\u201d\n\nSabah, a Turkish newspaper that is close to Erdogan\u2019s government, published a report Tuesday describing how the battle might unfold. It said Turkish armed forces would wait for the full withdrawal of U.S. troops before commencing any operation. Warplanes and howitzers would pound enemy positions, and then Turkish troops would enter Syria from several points along the border, east of the Euphrates River.\n\nThe military would advance as far as 18 miles into Syrian territory, the report said, without naming its source. After the operation was completed, Turkey would \u201ccontinue its humanitarian work to bring back locals in the area.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman for a Turkish-backed Syrian rebel group, called the National Army, said its fighters were making preparations for the operation but had still received no orders to move.\n\nSarah Dadouch in Beirut contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "There was no sign Tuesday that Turkish troops were advancing into Syria.", "authors": ["Kareem Fahim", "Istanbul Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ypQ34cPHqIlqomme4EAk1Ow4f-E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G75AF4HJZYI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
