Canada are without a win in their last 10 World Cup matches.\n\nThe cancellation means that only one game was held at the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium -- Uruguay's stunning, 30-27 upset of Fiji in Pool D.\n\nThe stadium, the only purpose-built venue at the World Cup, was built on the site of a school which was the scene for the \"Miracle of Kamaishi\", when more than 400 children sprinted into the mountains to safety.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the teams and also their fans, but also the people of Kamaishi, who have been incredible during what has been a special journey in recent years,\" said Gilpin.\n\n\"Nobody will be more disappointed than them, but also nobody would have better empathy with the decision.\"\n\nOrganizers said fans should not travel to the stadium, which will be closed, and they would be entitled to a full refund.\n\nAll eyes are now on whether the do-or-die match between hosts Japan and Scotland in Yokohama will go ahead.\n\nDetailed venue inspections at Hanazono and Yokohama are currently underway, and an update will be published when that important process has been completed, World Rugby said in a statement.\n\nThe Japan-Scotland game has become the subject of an ugly war of words, with the Scots threatening legal action if it is not played.\n\nIf the match were cancelled, it would be awarded as a 0-0 draw -- sending the Scots home and Japan through to their first quarterfinal.\n\nOrganizers have come in for hefty criticism for cancelling two matches planned for Saturday -- England vs France and New Zealand vs Italy.\n\nIt was the first time in the 32-year history of the Rugby World Cup that a match has been cancelled and fueled criticism of tournament organizers for hosting it in Japan during typhoon season.\n\nHowever, organizers said that despite a \"robust\" contingency plan, the scale of Hagibis, which covered practically the entire country, meant it was unsafe and impractical to move those matches to another venue.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Rugby World Cup organizers on Sunday announced the cancellation of the match between Namibia and Canada due to Typhoon Hagibis but said they were \"optimistic\" the others could go ahead.
