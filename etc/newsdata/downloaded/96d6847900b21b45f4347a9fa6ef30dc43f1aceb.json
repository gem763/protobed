Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders points to 'costly blunders' in years since 9/11 attacks Krystal Ball touts Sanders odds in Texas Manufacturing group leads coalition to urge Congress to reauthorize Ex-Im Bank MORE (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenNorth Carolina race raises 2020 red flags for Republicans, Democrats Poll: Biden proposal more popular than 'Medicare for All' in general election Biden holds 10-point lead in Texas poll, Warren moves into second past O'Rourke MORE (D-Mass.), his two biggest challengers for the nomination.\n\nBiden, the front-runner in the race, will be flanked by the more progressive Sanders and Warren, setting the stage for a battle over the party\u2019s path.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that the trio will throw haymakers at one another.\n\nSanders and Warren have refused to attack one another so far, and instead have teamed up to defend their policies against attacks from more centrist Democrats.\n\nBiden has been the target of attacks, but as the front-runner may have little interest in launching into attacks on his opponents.\n\nEven if some punches are pulled, the debate should show off the ideologic and strategic battles that have characterized the campaign so far.\n\nBiden has dug into the idea that he is the Democrat best-positioned to defeat Trump, partly because of his centrist politics. Sanders and Warren have a chance to puncture his case on electability while contrasting their more ambitious policy ideas.\n\nThe former vice president, for his part, could aim to warn Democrats they risk losing the White House without nominating the safe choice.\n\nCan Biden show he\u2019s ready?\n\nBiden is the race\u2019s front-runner, but has looked shaky on the debate stage, which has raised questions about his age and stamina.\n\nThursday\u2019s three-hour debate will be a new endurance test for the former veep.\n\nHe has proven that a broad swath of voters basically like him, and that his years in the Obama administration have bought him good will and support from much of the Democratic base.\n\nHis greatest vulnerability is that his age and penchant for gaffes will make him an easy target for Trump.\n\nThe president has said Biden is \u201cnot playing with a full deck\u201d and the conservative aggregator Drudge Report ran a banner headline about Biden\u2019s \u201ceye filling with blood\u201d when he suffered a burst blood vessel during a town hall event on CNN last week.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden will be under pressure to show Democratic voters that he\u2019s fit, physically and mentally, for the presidency \u2014 and to do battle with Trump.\n\nCan O\u2019Rourke deliver in his home state?\n\nAfter electrifying Texas Democrats by nearly toppling Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzTrump set to meet with aides about reducing capital gains taxes Biden holds 10-point lead in Texas poll, Warren moves into second past O'Rourke Primary challenges show potential cracks in Trump's GOP MORE (R-Texas) in 2018, there were high hopes for former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who entered the presidential race as a fundraising juggernaut and the perception that he would be a serious contender.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s fundraising has since dried up and he\u2019s bottomed out in the polls, leading some Democrats to wish that he would abandon his presidential run and return to Texas to challenge Sen. John Cornyn John CornynBiden holds 10-point lead in Texas poll, Warren moves into second past O'Rourke Suburban anxiety drives GOP on guns Trump awards Medal of Valor, civilian honors to responders in Dayton and El Paso shootings MORE (R).\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who once represented El Paso, where 22 people were killed by a gunman last month, has rebooted his campaign to focus almost exclusively on gun violence and white nationalist racism.\n\nSince the El Paso shooting, O\u2019Rourke has led the Democratic field in calling for new restrictions on guns \u2013 including a proposed \u201cmandatory buyback\u201d \u2014 and blamed Trump for creating the conditions that have led to racial violence in the U.S.\n\nHe has abandoned traditional political campaigning, letting loose with curse words and visiting states that don\u2019t usually attract candidates in an effort to highlight racial injustice.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t boosted him in the polls, but there\u2019s no better opportunity for O\u2019Rourke to get a second look than to be pitted against the top contenders in his home state.\n\nA Univision poll released this week found O\u2019Rourke running even with Biden in Texas, a crucial Super Tuesday state with a massive delegate haul.\n\nCan Yang keep rising?\n\nTech entrepreneur Andrew Yang Andrew YangElectric vehicles won't save us from climate change Poll: All 2020 Democrats but Warren beat Trump in New Hampshire Sanders slips in NH, Biden and Warren in statistical dead heat MORE has been one of the primary\u2019s biggest surprises, coming from nowhere to raise millions from his \u201cYang Gang\u201d of donors.\n\nAlong the way, Yang appears to be having the time of his life, basking in the unexpected energy around his campaign and going viral this week with a crowd-surfing video.\n\nThe sum total has Yang running about even in the polls with O\u2019Rourke, Sen. Cory Booker Cory Anthony BookerPoll: Top-tier Democrats lead Trump by at least 40 points among Hispanics Sanders slips in NH, Biden and Warren in statistical dead heat Rosario Dawson confirms Booker endorsement after suggesting she doesn't back a candidate MORE (D-N.J.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump issues Taliban warning at Sept. 11 memorial Biden holds 10-point lead in Texas poll, Warren moves into second past O'Rourke Biden has 15-point lead over Democratic primary field: poll MORE.\n\nOn Thursday, Yang will be the only outsider and nonpolitician on stage.\n\nMany Democrats still don\u2019t know what to make of Yang, other than to acknowledge that the anti-establishment sentiment from 2016 is still running strong and creating a lane for an outsider to leave a mark on the race in 2020.\n\nNow Yang faces his biggest moment yet and a chance for a real breakthrough as the focus narrows to a smaller group of candidates in Houston.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDemocrats have not won statewide in Texas in 25 years, but they have high hopes of ending that drought in 2020.\n\nA Univision survey released this week found all of the top Democratic White House hopefuls leading Trump in Texas. The president only carried the Lone Star State by 9 points in 2016, the worst showing for a GOP presidential candidate in 20 years.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is holding several events around Houston to highlight how they\u2019re going after suburban voters in a state with four of the fastest-growing metro areas in the country.\n\nAfter flipping two House seats in Texas in 2018, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has circled six more as competitive in 2020, including three where the GOP incumbent is retiring rather than seeking reelection.\n\nThere is effectively no path for the GOP to the White House without Texas, andRepublicans here acknowledge that they\u2019re playing defense for the first time in decades.\n\nStill, political operatives will tell you that \u201cTexas is still Texas\u201d and that anyone predicting the state will go blue in 2020 is getting ahead of themselves.", "description": "HOUSTON \u2014 Democratic presidential candidates will gather for a three-hour Texas showdown on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoe_warrenelizabeth_sandersbernie_091019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
