Though he was able to rise above neck-and-neck pre-election polling with Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, vote projections indicate that Trudeau will lead a minority government, falling short of the 170 seats needed for a parliamentary majority.\n\nThroughout the mercifully short, six-week campaign, Trudeau was mired in controversy, from charges of climate hypocrisy for spouting green rhetoric while purchasing a $3.4 billion oil pipeline to allegedly pressuring the former attorney general to impede an investigation into a construction company in Quebec. And on September 18, Time published a picture of Trudeau in brownface. At least two more similarly racist photos soon surfaced in turn, along with the following nightmare of a statement: that he was \u201cwary of being definitive about\u201d the number of times he\u2019d appeared in racist makeup.\n\nIf projections are correct, the Liberal Party\u2019s minority leadership will be the fourth such government in 15 years, and it would require the Liberals to partner with one or more parties to pass legislation. Trudeau will have until mid-January to recall the House of Commons, the lower chamber of parliament.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hung on through multiple controversies, including a blackface scandal, to win reelection, though projections show that his Liberal Party will form a minority government, suffering a blow.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/21/trudeau_win.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
