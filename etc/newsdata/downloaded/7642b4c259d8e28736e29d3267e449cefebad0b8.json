That doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that everyone is handily earning enough to make ends meet at current prices. Stagnant earnings and the vast inequalities that have accumulated over recent decades have hurt the living standards of too many American families. Clearly, the prices of many essential goods and services \u2014 health care, college tuition, child care \u2014 are climbing a lot faster than many people\u2019s incomes.\n\nAnd yet, overall inflation has remained historically quite low, meaning the prices of a lot of other stuff we consume must be growing slower than average. Using the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred gauge for overall price growth, over the past 10 years (August 2009 to August 2019), consumer inflation has risen on average 1.5 percent per year, just a tick up from its lowest 10-year growth rate in the history of the data, going back to 1959. Consider, for example, energy costs, which are up a mere 1.4 percent per year over the decade. That little number is actually a huge problem: Since most of our energy consumption is still fossil fuels, it signals just how underpriced energy is given its contribution to global warming. But it\u2019s still holding down overall prices. Same for many of the electronic goods we know and love. Once you factor in what they can do compared with what they could do a decade ago, laptops, for example, have massively fallen in price.\n\nEconomists don\u2019t have a great explanation for the slowing in overall prices, but some leading ideas include Internet shopping and increased globalization. Both factors are surely in play, but the fact is they\u2019ve both been around for a while, and their impact has somewhat leveled off. Also, once you break down inflation\u2019s components, you find that the slowdown is mostly in the services category, not in the goods that are imported from abroad and often sold at discount online or in big-box stores. One interesting factor holding down prices is a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy having to do with our expectations. The Federal Reserve has convinced people that it will do what it takes to keep inflation around its 2 percent target, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to expect (the phrase is \u201cwell-anchored inflationary expectations\u201d).\n\nSo has slower inflation led to faster real wage and income growth? In some short periods, yes, like in 2015, when sharply falling energy prices gave the buying power of wages and incomes a big boost. But over longer periods, weak inflation tends to be correlated with weak incomes, especially for low- and moderate-income families. In fact, both trends reflect an underlying problem of an underheated economy.\n\nSometimes in economics, as in life, the solution is embedded in the problem. Because inflation has been so unthreatening, the Federal Reserve has generally kept their feet off the economic brakes, even as unemployment has dropped to levels that, earlier in our history, pumped up inflation. In fact, in recent months, even with unemployment near a 50-year low, the Fed has been lowering the benchmark interest rate they control to offset economic jitters from the trade war and slower global growth (the trade war, by the way, adds slightly to inflationary pressures by raising the consumer price of imports).\n\nWhatever its causes, low inflation is bequeathing a very important opportunity to the U.S. economy: It is allowing us to run hotter-for-longer labor markets that are providing real opportunities to people who typically might have been left behind under more normal conditions. These workers \u2014 often in rural areas with fewer jobs on offer or toiling in very low-paying jobs in services \u2014 have the least bargaining clout. But when they can incant some version of \u201ctake this job and shove it!\u201d they can move up.\n\nWe see this in recent news about low-wage workers upgrading their jobs. We see it in workers with criminal records getting a much closer look from employers than would be the case at higher unemployment. We see it in workers with disabilities getting the chance they deserve to contribute to the workplace. We see it in employers allowing their workers a chance to better balance life and work. Here\u2019s how one restaurant owner recently put it: \u201cIt used to be that you\u2019d look at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and some things were an automatic disqualifier. Now there\u2019s really no disqualifier. Anyone who comes in, we\u2019ll interview them.\u201d\n\nLow inflation is at the heart of these beneficent developments, as it has allowed powerful policymakers such as Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell to grow more comfortable with a degree of labor market tightness that spooked such leaders in the past, as they feared spiraling inflation was just around the corner.\n\nBy now, we\u2019ve been around enough corners that we know this isn\u2019t the case: Inflation is, as noted, well-anchored at low rates. That could, of course, change. In fact, much research finds that there still is a relationship between tight labor markets and faster price growth. It\u2019s just much diminished.\n\nThus, should inflation begin to rise, as it may well do, the key job for policymakers is to manage that development without tossing out the critical benefits the country has been getting from low inflation. Inflation has been so low for so long that there\u2019s no reason to freak out if it settles in at a higher rate for a while (if it accelerates quickly, that\u2019s a different story, calling for more aggressive rate hikes).\n\nBut until then, let us continue to analyze and document the benefits of full employment, especially as the inflationary costs of achieving those benefits are so uniquely low.\n\nNote: I\u2019ll be speaking about these issues today, Thursday, Oct. 3, at the Brookings Institution.
