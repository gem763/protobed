The company sparked a firestorm last week by punishing a Hong Kong gamer who spoke up in support of protests against China during a live-stream. Today, Blizzard announced it was canceling a promotional event originally scheduled to take place tomorrow in New York but it wouldn\u2019t say why.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment has canceled its launch event for Overwatch on Nintendo Switch, which was scheduled for Oct. 16 at the Nintendo store in New York City. Nintendo announced the event\u2019s cancellation late on Oct. 14\u2026 Neither Blizzard nor Nintendo gave a reason for the event\u2019s cancellation. Polygon has reached out to Blizzard for more information. Overwatch launches on the Nintendo Switch today.\n\nHere\u2019s the actual announcement:\n\nPlease be aware that the previously announced Overwatch launch event scheduled for Wednesday, 10/16 at NintendoNYC has been cancelled by Blizzard. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. \u2014 Nintendo NY (@NintendoNYC) October 15, 2019\n\nNotice that this announcement is coming from Nintendo (makers of the Switch console), not from Blizzard. So far, Blizzard hasn\u2019t said anything about the cancellation to any of the major gaming sites.\n\nDespite the official silence, it\u2019s not hard to guess what is going on here. If the company had gone forward with the launch event tomorrow, the result would have been dozens of angry gamers showing up with signs or t-shirts that read \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d Images and videos of the event would have spread on social media and the company would have taken another hit.\n\nThe cancellation may work tomorrow but Blizzard won\u2019t be able to dodge this problem much longer. Protests are expected outside its upcoming annual convention, Blizzcon, which is just two weeks away. I suspect not all of the protesters will remain outside the event.\n\nThe company already walked back their punishment of the Hong Kong gamer who spoke up but that obviously wasn\u2019t enough to win back disappointed fans and players. If they want to change the dynamic they need to do what the NBA has failed to do: Take a stand for freedom even if it angers mainland China. At this point, Blizzard still seems to believe angry players are less of a threat than an angry communist dictatorship. Only time will tell if they are right.", "description": "\"Neither Blizzard nor Nintendo gave a reason for the event\u2019s cancellation.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Blizzcon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
