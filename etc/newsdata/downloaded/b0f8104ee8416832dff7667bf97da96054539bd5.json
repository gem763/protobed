Joe Kennedy. | Elise Amendola/AP Photo Elections \u2018I would tell Joe to wait\u2019: Democrats warn Kennedy against challenging Markey Ed Markey has the backing of many of his Senate colleagues, but Joe Kennedy is not without allies.\n\nJoe Kennedy doesn\u2019t have to just beat incumbent Ed Markey to win a Senate seat. He\u2019ll also have to trounce Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm \u2014 and maybe Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe 38-year-old congressman and grandson of Robert F. Kennedy will confront a buzz saw of Washington Democrats if he takes the leap to challenge the Massachusetts senator, a move that would create a massive distraction for the party in a safe Democratic state amid a battle for both the White House and the Senate majority.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThat kind of intraparty fighting is not good in the long term. And I don\u2019t think it will be good for Joe Kennedy,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) warned. \u201cI\u2019m a survivor of the [Ted] Kennedy-[Jimmy] Carter fight. I know how long those sentiments last.\u201d\n\nWith Kennedy flirting with the race and leading in early polls, Markey has moved quickly to shore up support from both the Washington establishment and prominent progressives. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) has endorsed him, and Schumer said the party is \u201cfully behind Sen. Ed Markey.\u201d Kennedy called Schumer about the race, but the Senate minority leader didn\u2019t divulge what was said.\n\nMarkey also asked Ocasio-Cortez for her support, according to a source familiar with the matter. The liberal firebrand said endorsing Markey is \u201cin the realm of possibility.\u201d\n\nKennedy isn\u2019t without allies. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a moderate Democrat who served with Kennedy in the House, is urging him to run and told Markey of her decision on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cJoe Kennedy is an outstanding champion for his state,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fresh thinker who can bring people together to get things done. He will make a terrific U.S. senator, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to support my friend.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Playbook newsletter Our must-read rundown of what\u2019s up on Beacon Hill and beyond.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) for Markey, along with the incumbent\u2019s close relationship with Ocasio-Cortez as original co-sponsors of the \u201dGreen New Deal,\u201d demonstrates that the potential Senate race won\u2019t revolve around ideological conflicts like the GOP\u2019s tea party wave of a decade ago.\n\nInstead, the contest is shaping up to be generational: The youthful Kennedy and his famous family brand against Markey\u2019s 40-plus years of service and lengthy liberal record.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how anyone wants to run against him \u2014 I mean he is the progressive leader on climate in the United States Congress,\u201d Khanna, a leading liberal lawmaker, said of Markey. \u201cThe progressive base is 100 percent for Markey \u2014 it\u2019s 110 percent for Markey.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would tell Joe to wait,\u201d Manchin, the Senate\u2019s most conservative Democrat, said. \u201cThose type of fights when two people are aligned ideologically? What\u2019s the fight?\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts delegation is behind Markey, save for three members who have yet to weigh in, including progressive star Ayanna Pressley, who upset longtime Rep. Mike Capuano in a primary last fall. Kennedy\u2019s challenge to the old guard has perplexed senators, who see him as trying to climb the political ladder at the expense of his state\u2019s seniority.\n\nBut many of his House colleagues are quietly rooting for him, eager to demonstrate one of their own can advance without waiting until senators retire or their longtime leaders depart the top rungs of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nAnd Markey\u2019s supporters in the Senate aren\u2019t trashing Kennedy. After all, he could be a future colleague or presidential candidate given his lineage and reputation as an ascendant voice in the party.\n\n\u201cEd has been a great partner in the Senate, and I was glad to endorse him last February. Joe is doing a terrific job in Congress. They both are longtime friends,\u201d Warren said in an interview. Warren was Kennedy\u2019s professor at Harvard University.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Markey touted his endorsement from NARAL Pro-Choice America, the League of Conservation Voters, senators and state lawmakers. Asked about polls showing Kennedy with an edge, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m getting tremendous support.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far the response I\u2019m getting is overwhelmingly positive,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve led on climate change, led on gun reform, led on reproductive rights and protections for women \u2026 people are grateful.\u201d\n\nSen. Ed Markey. | Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n\nMarkey said he hasn\u2019t spoken to Kennedy recently.\n\nKennedy is expected to make a decision by the end of the month, according to a campaign aide. Kennedy spokeswoman Emily Kaufman said the congressman is still deliberating but is \u201cencouraged\u201d by his support.\n\n\u201cIf he decides to run, it will be based on the people of Massachusetts \u2014 and them alone,\u201d Kaufman said.\n\nDespite Kennedy\u2019s famous last name, he\u2019s kept a low profile since arriving in the House in 2013. He has resisted calls to join House leadership, focusing instead on elevating younger members of a caucus run by septuagenarian leaders. He did deliver the State of the Union response last year, a job usually reserved for the party\u2019s rising stars, although his speech is mostly remembered for the prominent smudge of lip balm that some viewers mistook for drool.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years in the House, Markey won a special election to replace John Kerry in 2013 and is a leading liberal lawmaker in the Senate, though not necessarily a partisan firebrand. He has one of the thickest accents in Congress, sometimes referred to as Ed \u201cMahkey.\u201d He voted \u201cpresent\u201d on war with Syria shortly after being sworn in, annoying \u201cliterally everyone,\u201d as Boston magazine put it.\n\nSeveral House Democrats were reluctant to weigh in on the potential primary. Some said privately they\u2019re convinced Kennedy is running. And they offered effusive praise for the four-term lawmaker, who has developed a cadre of friends on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\u201cJoe Kennedy might be the most popular member of the Class of 2012 in both parties,\u201d Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) said. \u201cMassachusetts and the country will find a good place for Joe Kennedy to serve. It may not be in House leadership, but he has a great future.\u201d\n\nAs the heir to a dynasty, Kennedy appears an instant front-runner in any statewide race. There\u2019s private skepticism among some Democrats that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will spend money in a primary in a state seen as uncompetitive in a general election, though DSCC Chairwoman Catherine Cortez Masto said the party is behind Markey. The primary would be in September 2020 \u2014 poor timing for party unity.\n\nKennedy has a double-digit lead in early polls in a potential race against Markey. And he could potentially scare Markey into retirement or position himself for the next Senate vacancy if Warren becomes president.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

He\u2019s telling fellow senators that he is not retiring and will run hard against Kennedy, according to those who have spoken with him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ambition,\u201d Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said of Kennedy\u2019s motivation. \u201cFor Ed\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t want a primary. \u2026 He\u2019s clearly running for reelection. And I\u2019m going to help him in any way I can.\u201d\n\nThe show of support from top Democratic leaders and progressives suggests there\u2019s some worry that Markey could lose to Kennedy or at a minimum drain money from the party\u2019s coffers. So if Kennedy runs, Democrats are preparing for a wild ride.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s life in a blue state,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a former DSCC chairman. \u201cThe Kennedy name probably has a little bit of stroke in Massachusetts. So chances are it might be\u201d competitive.\n\nMelanie Zanona contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Ed Markey has the backing of many of his Senate colleagues, but Joe Kennedy is not without allies.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett", "Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1a/b9/6f0af6e74ea381996a39ab312ded/20190911-joe-kennedy-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
