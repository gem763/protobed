Biden Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms.\n\nIn a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden\u2019s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors w ho are especially engaged on social media . Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists.\n\nAs the candidates make their final pitches to donors before a quarterly fund-raising deadline at midnight Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other top rivals are outspending Mr. Biden online. He was only the sixth-biggest Democratic spender on Facebook ads in the seven days ending Thursday, even as he was at the center of a swirling national controversy involving President Trump, Ukraine and impeachment .\n\nInstead, he has shifted his spending priorities toward traditional tactics like buying television ads in Iowa. But that strategy has not paid dividends so far: Ms. Warren, a leading rival for the 2020 nomination, recently surpassed him in a key Iowa poll.", "description": "In a race where many voters are following politics online, Mr. Biden\u2019s pullback is a striking and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the digitally active.", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/us/politics/00bidendigitalads-01/00bidendigitalads-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
