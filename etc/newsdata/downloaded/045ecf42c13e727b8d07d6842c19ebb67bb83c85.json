They say they will only talk to Afghan authorities after a deal with the US is agreed.\n\nThe US currently has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, and there are thousands more from a Nato mission to train, advise and assist the country's own security forces.\n\nWho are the contenders?\n\nEighteen men - including former warlords, ex-spies and members of the country's former communist government - initially put themselves forward to fight the election, but five have dropped out.\n\nNot one woman is running for president, and only three women appear on the tickets of others.\n\nImage copyright BBC Monitoring\n\nRead more:", "description": "Preliminary data suggests a turnout of about 25% - the lowest since the Taliban were ousted in 2001.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AFE8/production/_109023054_hi056871293.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
