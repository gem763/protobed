And I mean literally purged,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe incident was not a part of the Oklahoma public schools\u2019 curriculum until 2000, and only recently entered American-history textbooks.\u201d\n\n\u2018Timeline: The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre\u2019 [Tulsa World]\n\nTracking the conditions leading up to, during, and following the 14-hour-period of May 31-June 1, 1921, such as the previous investigation into the corrupt police force and the arrest of a young black teenager for allegedly attacking a white female elevator operator (a case that was later dismissed). As the suspect was held in a courthouse cell, a large crowd gathered outside, leading to armed confrontation and looting. \u201cAt dawn, a force of \u2018citizens, police and members of the National Guard,\u2019 numbering perhaps 1,500, moved into Greenwood from the south and west, under orders to take into protective custody unarmed blacks and to subdue any who resisted.
