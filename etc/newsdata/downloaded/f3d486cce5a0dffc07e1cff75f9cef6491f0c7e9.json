The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.7%.\n\nThe latest spat between the world's two largest economies began late Monday when the Commerce Department added 28 Chinese entities to an export blacklist, citing their role in Beijing's repression of Muslim minorities in northwest China. The U.S. said the move wasn't related to trade negotiations with Beijing.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged the U.S. to withdraw its move against the Chinese firms. \"China will continue to take firm and strong measures to uphold its national sovereignty, our security and development interests,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nThe State Department followed up on Tuesday afternoon by saying it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese officials linked to abuses in Xinjiang, a move that accelerated market declines.\n\nHigh-level trade talks are set to resume Thursday, with a delegation led by China's top trade envoy, Liu He, scheduled to meet with U.S. officials in Washington.\n\n\"I don't think that we're going to see a grand deal,\" said Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. A more likely outcome would be \"small victories\" such as deals to expand Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods or to withdraw threatened tariffs, he added.\n\nThe Trump administration has rattled markets in recent months with mixed signals on trade, periodically threatening to escalate the fight with Beijing while sometimes offering signs that a resolution to the dispute is getting closer.\n\nThe new leader of the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cited trade tensions as a key risk to growth in a debut speech warning of a deteriorating global economic outlook.\n\n\"The global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown,\" said Kristalina Georgieva of Bulgaria, who took the helm of the IMF a week ago.\n\nFinancials were among the worst-performing sectors of the S&P 500, falling 1.7%. JPMorgan Chase lost 1.9%, while Bank of America was down 2%.\n\nConstruction-equipment maker Caterpillar, often considered a bellwether for global trade, dropped 1.8%. General Motors, which is in the fourth week of a strike by the United Auto Workers union, tumbled 2.1%.\n\nU.S. government bonds gained after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would soon announce plans to increase the amount of short-term Treasury securities it purchases over time, a measure aimed at stabilizing wholesale funding markets.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasurys fell to 1.539%, according to Tradeweb, from 1.552% on Monday. Bond yields fall as prices rise.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures fell 0.2% to $52.63 a barrel, while gold declined less than 0.1% to $1497.20.\n\nOverseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 sank 1.1%. Shares in London Stock Exchange Group tumbled 5.8% after Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing pulled a $36.6 billion bid for its London rival, a deal that would have united two major trading hubs.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 1%, and Korea's Kospi gained 1.2%. Stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong rose 0.3%.\n\nEva Dou contributed to this article\n\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 17:19 ET (21:19 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
