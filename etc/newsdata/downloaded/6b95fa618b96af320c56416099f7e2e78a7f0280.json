Around 30 stitchers worked for some 1,500 hours on the stretch of linen, which begins with King Robert Baratheon visiting the Starks in Winterfell.\n\nSome 87 meters (95 yards) later, it ends in fire and blood with the final, controversial, scenes of the eighth season.\n\nDepicting all that gore using jacquard threadwork was not easy, said project chief embroiderer Valerie Wilson.\n\nIt would have been a challenge that also faced the medieval embroiderers, who created the famous 70-meter Bayeux tapestry to recount the invasion of England by William the Conquerer. The work brings to life scenes such as the 1066 Battle of Hastings, where Harold of Wessex is shown dying with an arrow to the eye.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 tapestry references the Bayeux tapestry stylistically and in terms of some of the motifs that have been used and the way that the story unrolls in a linear fashion,\u201d said Wilson.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nThe two tapestries also address a common theme, said Antoine Verney, chief curator of the Bayeux Tapestry Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s whether we can justify violence to claim power,\u201d he said.\n\nThe show was based on the \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d books by George R.R. Martin.\n\nThe \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d exhibition in Bayeux runs from Sept. 13 to Dec. 31 at the Hotel du Doyen, on the site where the Bayeux Tapestry itself was originally displayed before its eventual move to the dedicated museum nearby.", "description": "The French town of Bayeux has been home for nearly a millennium to a tapestry depicting a bloody battle for power.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429556115&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C25M", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
