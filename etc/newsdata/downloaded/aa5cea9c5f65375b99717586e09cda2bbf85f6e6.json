Barr.\n\nMr. Barr and other law enforcement officials in the United States, Britain and Australia are asking the technology company to scrap its much-touted plan to make all of its messaging services end-to-end encrypted by default, BuzzFeed reported last week. The move is likely the first salvo in a broader fight against programs that put users\u2019 communications out of government\u2019s reach - a trend that Mr. Barr this summer called \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cexceptionally dangerous.\u201d\n\nBut leaving consumers\u2019 information unprotected is dangerous, too. The officials say in their letter that they support a \u201cmeans for lawful access,\u201d otherwise known as a \u201cbackdoor\u201d for authorities to enter when they come knocking with a warrant. The problem is, a door for U.S. authorities could be a door for everyone else. And everyone else wants in.\n\nServices such as WhatsApp operate with a universal code, which means the moment the United States is offered a security workaround, the leaders of countries far less free will start asking for similar treatment. Egypt, the New York Times recently reported, has been conducting sophisticated cyberattacks on its opposition politicians and civil society. Devices can be altered for individual markets, but that doesn\u2019t mean building intentional vulnerabilities is wise. Last week, Microsoft revealed that the Iranian government had attempted to breach email accounts belonging to a U.S. presidential campaign. Create a \u201cgolden key\u201d for the good guys here, and hackers might find ways to unlock whatever they wish.\n\nMr. Barr\u2019s concerns are legitimate. Criminals take advantage of these systems to conduct their business in the dark, and some of that business, such as child exploitation imagery, is repugnant. There is a tradeoff between security and safety. But the tradeoff need not be absolute. Even with encryption, there are ways to gather evidence, and there could be areas for compromise beyond the debate over a backdoor.\n\nSolutions might vary depending on the abuse being targeted, and each possibility comes with narrower tradeoffs of its own. Forwarding limits could stop disinformation from going viral; filtering tools could conceivably allow users to reject flagged material from being sent to them or prevent some material from being sent altogether. Some believe the way forward for criminal investigations is to permit court-compelled device unlocking for suspects in custody; others believe lawful hacking is the answer. But preventing end-to-end encryption entirely would be a mistake.\n\nOnline: https://www.washingtonpost.com\n\n___\n\nOct. 8\n\nChicago Sun-Times on toxic spills in one of the Great Lakes that have polluted drinking water:\n\nYou might think that when a company has a long record of polluting our drinking water, including a recent chemical spill that killed thousands of fish in Lake Michigan, state and federal officials would spring into action.\n\nYou might think the U.S. EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management would have begun investigating long ago, methodically and aggressively, to understand why the polluting goes on and on, and taken every step to put an end to it.\n\nYou might think they would do their jobs.\n\nBut they have not.\n\nBoth government agencies have been pretty much missing in action, prompting two environmental groups on Friday to file a 60-day notice of a lawsuit in the hope of convincing the federal government and Indiana that it\u2019s not a good thing to allow dangerously toxic chemicals to flow into the lake.\n\nSuch a lawsuit is permitted by the federal Clean Water Act when the government fails to act.\n\nThe Environmental Law & Policy Center and the Hoosier Environmental Council report that the Burns Harbor steel mill in northwest Indiana, owned by ArcelorMittal, has broken clean-water laws more than 100 times since 2015. That includes an Aug. 11 toxic spill of concentrated cyanide and ammonia into a ditch that drains into the Little Calumet River, which in turn flows into Lake Michigan.\n\nThe ELPC says the \u201ctotal cyanide load\u201d discharged from one outfall at the mill was 548% higher than the legal limit on Aug. 12, 795% higher on Aug. 13, 557% higher on Aug 14 and 419% higher on Aug. 15. The amount of ammonia discharged into the environment also far exceeded the legal limit.\n\nYet the supposed environmental sheriffs here - the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management - have made an art of foot-dragging. They repeatedly have sent a message that cracking down on polluters is simply not a priority for them, particularly on the federal level by the Trump administration.\n\nAfter the most recent spill, local officials in Portage, Indiana, complained that the public was not warned for several days, at which point the sight of thousands of dead fish floating around a nearby marina made it clear something bad had happened.\n\nBoaters complained about the stench of the dead fish. Local fishermen were warned not to eat their catch. The toxic spill was so severe that officials closed nearby beaches, including in the Indiana Dunes National Park, and shut off a drinking water intake.\n\nThe EPA and IDEM have said they will file inspection reports about the Aug. 11 spill, but neither agency has taken formal enforcement action over any of the steel mill spills over the past four years, according to records obtained by The Environmental Law & Policy Center and the Hoosier Environmental Council.\n\nPart of the problem is that budget cuts have hacked away at IDEM\u2019s staffing levels year after year. And scientists at the U.S. EPA\u2019s regional office have complained for more than two years that the Trump administration\u2019s antipathy toward environmental regulations has made it harder for them to be effective. The bosses don\u2019t back them up.\n\nWhen government environmental watchdogs are not watching, any company has a motivation to handle toxic waste in the cheapest way possible, which can mean cutting corners in ways that add to environmental pollution.\n\nLast May, ArcelorMittal was fined more than $5 million for clean-air violations that date back years, but nothing was done about the clean-water violations.\n\nThe company says the Aug. 11 spill at its Burns Harbor facility occurred because of a loss of power at a pump station, and that workers did not realize wastewater with ammonia and cyanide would get into the lake.\n\nAssuming that explanation is true, it does not explain the many previous toxic spills. That kind of lax industrial management also is far less likely when there\u2019s a real government watchdog on duty.\n\nSeven million people get their drinking water from Lake Michigan. The U.S. EPA and the state of Indiana owe every one of them a thorough investigation and an end to this nonsense.\n\nOnline: https://chicago.suntimes.com\n\n___\n\nOct. 7\n\nThe New York Times on a tweet that created controversy between the National Basketball Association and China:\n\n\u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nDaryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted that message on Friday (Oct. 4). It\u2019s a sentiment that should command broad support in the United States, and throughout the free world.\n\nBut the reaction from China, which does not number free expression among its cherished values, was swift and painful for the N.B.A. The shoe company Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ended sponsorship deals with the Rockets; Chinese broadcasters said they would not show Rockets games; the Chinese Basketball Association - led by the former Rockets star Yao Ming - suspended ties with the team.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,\u201d said Adam Silver, the league\u2019s commissioner.\n\nMr. Silver went on to add that he supported Mr. Morey, but \u201cwhat I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation.\u201d\n\nThe billionaires who control the lucrative basketball league, however, nearly tripped over themselves in their haste to abjure Mr. Morey\u2019s remarks. The N.B.A., like many large American businesses, is besotted by the opportunity to make money in China\u2019s expanding market. And the league once again made clear it is willing to obey China\u2019s rules to preserve that chance.\n\nThe owner of the Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, raced for the traditional refuge of international capitalists - the insistence that business can be segregated from political considerations. \u201cWe\u2019re here to play basketball and not to offend anybody,\u201d Mr. Fertitta told ESPN.\n\nBut it should be perfectly clear that playing basketball in China is political.\n\nLast year, the N.B.A. staged a game in South Africa for the explicit purpose of celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. When the N.B.A. goes to China, that\u2019s a statement, too.\n\nIt means that the N.B.A. has weighed China\u2019s human rights abuses against China\u2019s potential as a source of revenue, and it has decided that it can live with state policies like the detention of hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims in the northwestern province of Xinjiang.\n\nThe owner of the Brooklyn Nets, the Chinese billionaire Joe Tsai, took the opportunity to publish an open letter scolding Americans for talking about the affairs of other nations. He also mischaracterized the Hong Kong protests as a \u201cseparatist movement.\u201d\n\nMr. Tsai\u2019s suggestion that people should avoid \u201cthird rail\u201d issues may well be good manners when visiting a foreign country, but Mr. Morey posted his tweet while visiting Japan - and on a website that is not accessible to the general public in mainland China.\n\nThe face of the Rockets, the point guard James Harden, issued a public apology on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe apologize,\u201d he said.\n\nFor what, exactly, remained unclear.\n\nDo the N.B.A.\u2019s owners appreciate that their wealth is a product of the freedoms they enjoy in this country? Does Mr. Harden, the owner of a famous beard, know that Muslims in Xinjiang are not allowed to grow beards like his?\n\nThe N.B.A. has an undoubted right to set rules for its work force, but it cannot simultaneously claim to champion free expression - the value of which consists entirely in the right to say what others don\u2019t want to hear.\n\nAmerican executives and policymakers initially reconciled themselves to following China\u2019s rules by arguing that China\u2019s turn toward capitalism, and its exposure to the United States, would gradually lead toward democracy and a greater respect for human rights. They argued, in effect, that silence was the most productive form of criticism.\n\nIt should now be clear that silence is merely complicity, no more or less.\n\nIt is the moral price the N.B.A. and other businesses are paying for making money in China.\n\nOnline: https://www.nytimes.com\n\n___\n\nOct. 6\n\nThe Khaleej Times on protests of the government in Iraq:\n\nWidespread poverty, unemployment, and corruption have crippled life in Iraq and is forcing its young population to pour their anger onto the streets to demand what should be their basic right in the first place. When communication with government fails, protests become the preferred vehicles to seek attention of leaders. The protesters, majorly from the Shia population, feel they have been left behind while other sects have benefitted more from Iraq\u2019s improving economic condition. They are calling for reforms. These young Iraqis are frustrated with pervasive corruption that has corroded every institution in the country. They are infuriated over the lack of employment opportunities which are arguably the only means to improve living conditions. They are vexed at the lack of basic amenities such as uninterrupted electricity. It\u2019s not too much to ask for. Come to think of it, why should an oil-rich country suffer poverty at this scale anyway? Iraq is among the top producers of oil. It\u2019s the second biggest in OPEC, and yet the Adel Abdul Mahdi government hasn\u2019t been able to steer the country to a better future. Yes, Iraq was ravaged by war but collective efforts by international community have put the country back on its feet.\n\nDespite foreign aid, the government has so far failed to turn its military victory over Daesh into social gains. Almost 60 percent of the population of 40 million is aged under 24. With education and opportunities to remain gainfully employed, the youth can help rebuild Iraq in a more constructive manner. Yet, they are on the streets escalating the protests into the worst civil unrest since 2017. Shutting down the Internet and imposing a curfew might help now, but it would not resolve the issue. True, there is no magic formula to solve the country\u2019s problems immediately, like Mahdi noted in his speech late on Thursday (Oct. 3). But there can be ways to improve the conditions of people, and the government would do well to explore and discuss them rather than just highlight the obvious. The Mahdi government should ensure sectarian divide in Iraq doesn\u2019t erode the gains made thus far.\n\nOnline: https://www.khaleejtimes.com\n\n___\n\nOct. 6\n\nThe Miami Herald on the policy that could deport Haitians from the Bahamas following Hurricane Dorian:\n\nThe Bahamas, for decades, has made clear that its Haitian residents, especially the undocumented, are not welcome. They are unfairly stigmatized, ostracized and bad-mouthed. But this is the worst time for the country to resume its iron-clad immigration policy of deporting Haitians who have been living in the Bahamas illegally.\n\nIn September, after Hurricane Dorian brought utter devastation to Grand Bahama Island and Abaco Island, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis declared that deportations would be suspended, a justified respite. Last week, though, he announced they would resume.\n\nObviously, the trauma of being deported before the hurricane to a dysfunctional Haiti - rocked by corruption, protests, an ineffectual government, a flummoxed president, food scarcity, rampant unemployment and even tent cities still inhabited almost a decade after the 2010 earthquake - pales in comparison to barely surviving Dorian\u2019s deadly ferocity and then being kicked out of the country, perhaps still unsure if relatives are dead in the debris or alive somewhere.\n\nMichelle Karshan, who runs a disaster-recovery program for children in Haiti, told the Editorial Board, \u201cThere\u2019s been no national budget for (two) years, there\u2019s a huge movement for the president to step down, hospitals and schools are not open and there are upwards of (30,000) internally displaced people since the earthquake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an impossibility to resettle people into Haiti now.\u201d\n\nDeportations, no doubt, will resume. However, it is particularly cruel to do so at this time. This is the same argument that the Editorial Board has made in recommending that the United States continue to extend Temporary Protected Status to Haitians who fled here after the 2010 earthquake.\n\nOf course, they are here legally, able to work and put down roots, however tentative. But Haiti is in no shape to receive those in the United States, either. And because they send remittances to relatives back home, ejecting them also cuts a financial lifeline.\n\nHaitian Bahamians, likewise, contribute to the economy. Why can\u2019t even the undocumented continue to do so, participating in efforts to rebuild the islands, earning money while doing so?\n\nThe Bahamas is a sovereign nation with the right to legislate its immigration policies as it sees fit. But the government\u2019s restrictions on Haitian residents\u2019 ability to return to communities such as the Mudd and Sandbanks by banning any rebuilding, after they\u2019ve been sequestered in shelters, sounds like a land grab, an attempt to get rid of a population that was never welcome in the first place.\n\nAs with any immigrant population, Haitian Bahamians have settled there for decades, creating families. Some have children who became citizens, some have offspring who are stateless because they failed to apply for citizenship between the ages of 18 and 19, as the law allows.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s foolhardy to demand that they present documents that prove they are legally able to live in the Bahamas when so many homes and their contents were completely destroyed.\n\nMinnis should show the same compassion he did immediately after the storm and not be swayed by politics. If he does not relent, we urge the members of CARICOM, an organization of Caribbean nations, to speak up on Haitians\u2019 behalf. The organization rightly protested when the Dominican Republic sought to withdraw citizenship from Haitians there.\n\nThe organization, while respecting the Bahamas\u2019 autonomy, should speak up now. The Bahamas is a CARICOM member. So is Haiti. That should count for something, especially during this humanitarian crisis.\n\nOnline: https://www.miamiherald.com\n\n___\n\nOct. 3\n\nThe Orange County Register on the executive power past and aspiring U.S. presidents:\n\nFor too long, the power of the executive branch has long exceeded the narrow set of powers and expectations set out by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nUnfortunately, there is little sign of this changing, with President Trump and the Democratic candidates alike perpetually seeking to push the limits of executive authority.\n\nJust because someone is elected president doesn\u2019t mean they can do whatever they\u2019d like. And even for those who claim a \u201cmandate,\u201d any purported mandate must be constrained by the limits of the constitution.\n\nWhile presidents have a tendency to take on an almost cultish devotion among their strongest supporters, Americans ought to see the dangerous path of infusing a single individual with so much power.\n\nThough there is still plenty of information to sort through, there is legitimate cause for concern about President Trump\u2019s apparent order to hold up congressionally approved aid to Ukraine ahead of a call with Ukraine\u2019s then newly-elected president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIt raises, among other things, red flags over the president breaching the separation of powers with regards to Congress\u2019 power of the purse.\n\nBut in addressing another sort of abuse of power, these pages have called out other instances of President Trump overextending the reach the executive branch ought to have.\n\nThis includes tariffs initiated officially under dubious national security grounds. It also includes his perpetuation of American involvement in conflicts without congressional authorization, particularly U.S.-support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s brutal war in Yemen. And it includes his efforts to sidestep Congress by declaring a national security at the southern border after Congress refused to fund a border wall.\n\nWhatever the merits of any of these ideas, there\u2019s supposed to be a process for implementing and pursuing such policies.\n\nUnfortunately, in sidestepping Congress and expanding the power of the executive branch, President Trump has merely followed those who came before him.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, those vying to succeed him aren\u2019t much better on that front.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates have been more than happy to run with the idea that they can abuse executive authority, particularly by way of executive orders, to get what want without having to go through Congress.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-California, for instance, has promised that if Congress doesn\u2019t agree to gun control policies to her liking, she\u2019ll simply issue executive orders to impose gun control policies.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s website touts the former vice president\u2019s promise to \u201csign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track\u201d with respect to climate change.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, meanwhile, has vowed to \u201cdo everything I can by executive order,\u201d on guns, while also wanting to use that power to raise the pay of women of color.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the American power have allowed presidents and aspiring presidents to get such an outsized view of their powers. It is likewise unfortunate that Congress has been allowed to do little more than allow things to run on autopilot, with only rare efforts to check presidential powers.\n\nOne thing is for certain: the founders would not recognize the federal government of today as what they envisioned and planned for.\n\nOnline: https://www.ocregister.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
