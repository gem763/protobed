What's everyone up to? #littleboy #really #youwasntsayingthat,\" he scornfully captioned.\n\nHe makes reference to Katie with \"you wasn't saying that\", as he flashed his own bulge.\n\nThe 41-year-old former glamour model was rated a measly 1/10 for her \"lazy\" sexploits by Charles.\n\n(Image: charlesdrury1/Instagram)\n\n(Image: charlesdrury1/Instagram)\n\nThe \"little boy\" reference was aimed at Kris, as Charles told The Sun that the personal trainer, 30, threatened him and called him a \"little boy\".\n\nCharles told The Sun that Kris and his mates pulled up to the drive and were \"shouting and giving it the big'un\".\n\nIt comes as Charles claimed she jumped into bed with him the first time they met, and snorted coke together before he passed out.\n\n(Image: charlesdrury1/Instagram)\n\nBut he moaned her performance wasn't anything to brag about to his mates, adding: \"I thought it was going to be better than what I expected. I was disappointed.\"\n\nNow an insider close to Katie tells Mirror Online that the mum of five is \"livid\" with Charles rating her sexual prowess so low.\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\n\"She's obviously going to be annoyed at the drug claims he's made about her, but rating her a one out of ten in bed is going to land him in really hot water with her,\" said our source.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Katie's whole image has been built up on her sex appeal, so implying she's rubbish in bed she will take to heart.\n\n\"In the past she's had boyfriends say some unpleasant things about her, but none have ever criticised her in this way.\"", "description": "Ex toyboy Charles Drury made another dig at the former glamour model after rating her 1/10 in bed", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram", "Mirror.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20729038.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Katie-Price.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
