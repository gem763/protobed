Back then, like its Parisian equivalent Pigalle, London\u2019s Soho was a neighbourhood that traded on its bad reputation, luring the curious and the bohemian with its after-hours strip clubs, shebeens, peep shows and sex workers. That the gullible or the inebriated could fall prey to pickpockets, hucksters and conmen only added to the area\u2019s illicit glamour.\n\nSoho\u2019s seediness survived, albeit in diluted form, into the 1980s and beyond, with such wayward songwriters as Shane MacGowan summoning its dark heart in song. In The Old Main Drag, he evokes the rent boys who once haunted the back alleys, charging a fiver \u201cfor a swift one off the wrist\u201d. All gone, all gone. In today\u2019s Soho, a fiver might just get you a detox smoothie or a couple of flat whites served by an underpaid, overworked millennial. Seediness has been supplanted by rampant development and Darwinian gentrification, with Crossrail currently cutting a swathe though the heart of the square mile, decimating entire blocks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Overlooked treasure \u2026 one of William Klein\u2019s characteristically dramatic shots. Photograph: William Klein\n\nAgainst all this it is perhaps inevitable that Shot in Soho, the Photographers\u2019 Gallery\u2019s latest ode to its own neighbourhood, has an apologetically elegiac undertow. Apart from a few nods to contemporary Soho, this is an evocation of a lost world as distant as London fog and the once ubiquitous greasy spoon cafe. It is also, intriguingly, a show that avoids the obvious \u2013 no Bill Brandt, John Deacon or Daniel Farson, save for glimpses of their work in a vitrine filled with enticing ephemera.\n\nRaid the saunas! Faces of Soho \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nInstead we have some overlooked treasures, not least a characteristically dramatic series by William Klein, commissioned by the Sunday Times in 1980 and published under the prescient heading: \u201cSoho\u2019s fight for survival.\u201d The first image is the most dramatic: a group of men exiting a \u201csauna and massage\u201d parlour, covering their faces against Klein\u2019s flash. The street number on the canopy above is 69.\n\nKlein roamed Soho, alert to moments that caught the tenor of the times: a trio of shaven-headed post-punks from Stevenage seem both beatific and oddly sinister; eager crowds of teenagers queue beneath a neon-lit cinema hoarding for Emanuelle: Queen Bitch. That these fresh-faced youngsters may be queuing for something else entirely was beside the point for Klein, for whom atmosphere was an essential element.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: William Klein\n\nIt is illuminating to compare Klein\u2019s brash colour shots of Soho\u2019s everyday people with Anders Petersen\u2019s stark monochrome portraits from 2012. Swedish-born Petersen befriended his sitters before creating his moody, high-contrast portraits, all dark shadows and pale skin tones. Traces of the old Soho are detectable in the \u201cotherness\u201d of many of his sitters: tattooed faces, hard drinkers, after-hours clubbers. But there is also a sense of engagement with the subjects that reflects Petersen\u2019s collaborative approach.\n\nElsewhere, two series from 1968 reveal how photojournalists were looking to find the humanity and desperation beneath the stereotypical representations of Soho. East Londoner Kelvin Brodie was a hard-boiled photographer who had covered conflicts in Northern Ireland and India before returning home. For a series called Passport to Soho, he accompanied special police teams carrying out late-night \u201csweeps\u201d in a bid to clean up the area. His images shift from the everyday (shopkeepers and street-sweepers) to the shadowy and clandestine (young women being questioned and arrested by police). They often have the shadowy patina of snatched surveillance photos, perfectly complementing the subject matter.\n\nAltogether more life-affirming is John Goldblatt\u2019s series The Undressing Room, shot over four consecutive nights in a dressing room of a strip club for the groundbreaking photo-mag Creative Camera. Here, intimacy is all, the women seemingly at ease with Goldblatt\u2019s often up-close presence, the unruly mundanity of their surroundings offset by their casual nudity and, in one instance, the appearance of one of the women\u2019s infant sons, who seems perfectly at home among the greasepaint and G-strings. Only the radiant beauty and glamour of one interrupts the abiding sense of routine. Otherwise, Goldblatt captures the banality, even boredom, of the performers\u2019 downtime as they smoke, chat, yawn and read magazines.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Banal glamour \u2026 a shot from The Undressing Room series by John Goldblatt. Photograph: John Goldblatt\n\nLess appealing is the late Corinne Day\u2019s diaristic series shot in her flat on Brewer Street in the 1990s, which seems more interesting for the fashionable people she shot \u2013 including a young Kate Moss \u2013 than for, as the catalogue insists, their \u201cunparalleled\u201d documentation of \u201cthe uninhibited 90s\u201d. They seem too slyly staged for that. Likewise Clancy Gebler Davies\u2019s late-90s, fly-on-the-wall shots of the often famous denizens of the Colony Room Club on Dean Street: Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, Gavin Turk. Again, it is the subjects rather than the style that fascinates, the bohemian bonhomie somewhat suspect in retrospect, given the avarice that was to follow.\n\nThe most recent series here is Daragh Soden\u2019s Looking for Love, a title that promises a lot more than the images deliver. The most haunting piece is his short 8mm film projection in which an anonymous older gay man talks matter-of-factly about love over images of bars, clubs and street scenes. In the same room, screenshots from Tinder and Grindr speak of another kind of interaction, stripped of flirtation. Soden\u2019s traditional street photography of present-day Soho \u2013 couples gathered beneath Eros, glitter balls, posed portraits \u2013 are disappointingly empty in contrast, particularly when compared to the vibrancy and intimacy elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps in Soho, it just takes time for today to look as melancholically entrancing as yesterday.", "description": "The slow demise of a bohemian melting pot is chronicled in a movingly melancholic show that shuns the obvious", "authors": ["Sean O Hagan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db6d3e6fdef5b846029ea2d3078e137317b3d557/15_0_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3a4aa425700ce503490a7867ca267436", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
