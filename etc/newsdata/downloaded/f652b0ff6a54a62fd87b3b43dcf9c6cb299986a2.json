Note how the Nasdaq Composite leaped when China expressed a \u201ccalm\u201d attitude toward trade talks. Yet, there\u2019s no need to buy the entire sector if you\u2019re a stock picker like me; thus, I feel that an allocation in Nvidia stock is a smart move given the current valuation.\n\nAI Developments Will Power NVDA Stock\n\nShar Narasimhan, a deep-learning specialist at Nvidia, dropped a bombshell of a blog post recently; in it, Narasimhan revealed Nvidia\u2019s latest AI developments and whether you\u2019re a tech-head or not, you can\u2019t deny the spirit of innovation at this company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMachine learning is based on language models, and Nvidia\u2019s two latest models are called BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer, and GPT-2, which stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer 2. These two language models are pushing the boundaries of true natural language processing, which includes the ability of machines to process complex language-understanding tasks and to impart deeper and more-nuanced meaning to language, almost like humans can do.\n\nIn terms of sheer numbers, I haven\u2019t seen anything from Intel that can compete with this: BERT is pre-programmed with a data set of 3.3 billion words and is capable of learning many more than that, while Nvidia\u2019s GPT-2 models are pre-formatted with a massive 37-gigabyte data set known as WebText. The use cases for these super-powered conversational AI language models remains to be seen, but I see this type of technology as the future of machine learning, and I\u2019m heartened to discover that Nvidia remains on the forefront as a robust AI innovator.\n\nRide the 5G Super-highway\n\nIf you\u2019re not invested in 5G \u2014 the ultra-fast, low-latency wireless communications network that will most likely power everyone\u2019s phone in the near future \u2014 you can take a nice starter position in 5G technology with Nvidia stock. To prove that this graphics company is fully dedicated to 5G power, Nvidia has embarked on a joint venture with LGU+ to launch a cloud-hosted gaming service based on the 5G network.\n\n\n\n\n\nLGU+ is an established mobile carrier in South Korea, and this partnership will enable gamers in the region to use the super-fast, cloud-based game-streaming service Geforce Now as early as September. Whether they choose to use their smartphones, laptops, or PCs, this will mark the first time that video-game fans in South Korea will get to play their favorite games entirely on the 5G platform \u2014 and since it\u2019s all in the cloud, there\u2019s no need for large, cumbersome downloads.\n\nLee Sang Min, an LGU+ spokesperson, is eager to provide the South Korean gaming community with lightning-fast game play and superior graphics. \u201cWe will continue to strengthen our competitive edge for 5G technology by providing our customers with new user experiences including augmented reality, virtual reality and gaming.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a highly promising partnership and perhaps a test case to determine if other regions of the world are ready to adopt 5G gaming on a similarly large scale.\n\nThe Takeaway on NVDA Stock\n\nA slowdown in the semiconductor space hasn\u2019t hit NVDA stock, as it has been able to perform above industry expectations. As Zacks\u2019 analyst Daniel Laboe noted, Nvidia produces higher-performing GPUs than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), maintain its market share consistently stronger, with the split being around 80/20.\n\nWith bleeding-edge AI innovation, 5G early-mover status, and other exciting developments in the pipeline, I\u2019m choosing NVDA stock as not just a graphics power player, but a tech titan that could surpass Intel very soon.\n\nAs of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post AI and 5G Advantages Stoke Bets on High-Powered Tech with Nvidia Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "Despite the best efforts of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to dominate the AI and 5G markets, I'm prepared to stand behind Intel's most impressive competitor, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and recommend a position in NVDA stock as a bullish wager on an absolute powerhouse in the graphics space.Source: Hairem /", "authors": ["David Moadel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/20RdRG.45xXxVpcNtkhtlA--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/a536f2dc4ec97c410ba61a75038f225b"}
