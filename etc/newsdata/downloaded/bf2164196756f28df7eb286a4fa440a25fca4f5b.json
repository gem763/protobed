Medics said two protesters were killed when they were hit by teargas canisters.\n\nDozens of ambulances and rickshaws ferried young men suffocating or hit by the canisters. Volunteers distributed water, washed faces with cola or milk, while others prepared sandwiches and lunch.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iraqi protesters run for cover.

But Abdul-Mahdi has been unable to address the growing discontent with promises of reform. In an address on Thursday night he warned that a collapse of the government would drag Iraq further into turmoil.\n\nOn Friday protesters in the southern city of Nasiriyah broke into the provincial government building and set it on fire, police said, while six protesters were wounded in the southern city of Amara in the Maysan district, when guards at the local office of Shia militia group Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq opened fire.\n\nProtests rage around the world \u2013 but what comes next? Read more\n\nProtesters in Baghdad, who had organised through social media, also directed their anger against Iran, Iraq\u2019s powerful neighbour. The crowd chanted \u201cIran out, out\u201d and ridiculed Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian general seen as the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the current government.\n\nMany were draped in Iraqi flags as they crossed the bridge, declaring \u201cour soul, our blood, we sacrifice for you Iraq.\u201d One policeman who was marching with the protesters picked up a tear gas canister and threw it back, urging them not to be scared.\n\n\u201cThey have eaten away at the country like cancer,\u201d said Abu Ali al-Majidi, 55, pointing in the direction of the government buildings in the Green Zone. \u201cThey are all corrupt thieves,\u201d he added, surrounded by his four sons who had come along for the protest.\n\nThe demonstrations are similar to those that have engulfed Lebanon in recent days, in that they are economically driven, largely leaderless and spontaneous against what is seen as a sectarian-based system and a corrupt political class that has ruled for decades driving the two countries to the brink of economic collapse.\n\nEarlier this month, violence spread across Iraq left 149 protesters dead. A government-appointed inquiry determined that security forces had used excessive force and recommended the firing of security chiefs in Baghdad and the south. Eight members of the security forces were also killed.\n\nIraq\u2019s most senior Shia spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, appealed in his Friday prayers to the protesters and security forces to avoid violence and urged the former to abstain from attacking security forces or public property.\n\nThe current round of protests has been endorsed by his chief rival, the nationalist Shia cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, who has a popular support base and the largest number of seats in parliament.", "description": "Demonstration against corruption and economic hardship was met with rubber bullets and teargas by police", "authors": ["Ghaith Abdul-Ahad"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459d1440ba661e0988b054082224fe9ebd294ffa/0_174_2089_1253/master/2089.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=598d53eb23eaa2403a65b7ac1a37e240", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
