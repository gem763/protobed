Pie Tray: CRAIG BROWN with 13 things you didn't know about My Way", "language": "en", "text": "This year sees the 50th anniversary of the release of Frank Sinatra\u2019s famous single \u2018My Way\u2019. It remained in the UK Top 40 for a record-breaking 75 weeks . . .\n\n1) Over the years, it has been picked as a Desert Island Disc by many castaways, including film producer Harvey Weinstein, philanthropist Reginald Kray and motorist Kenneth Noye.\n\n2) Statistics indicate that My Way is most commonly sung in public spaces by men between 55 and 75 years of age between 11pm and midnight, after at least half a dozen pints of beer. After half a dozen glasses of white wine, women of the same age prefer to sing \u2018I Will Survive\u2019.\n\n3) The lyrics of My Way were penned by veteran pop star Paul Anka to a tune originally commissioned in 1956 by Nikita Khrushchev to accompany the entry of the Soviet army into Hungary.\n\nStatistics indicate that My Way is most commonly sung in public spaces by men between 55 and 75 years of age between 11pm and midnight, after at least half a dozen pints of beer\n\n\u2018It is a stirring melody. Our patriotic troops gained great comfort from humming it as they marched,\u2019 observed Khrushchev in his memoirs, which were also called My Way. \u2018Furthermore, it is a tune that strikes terror into the heart of the counter-revolutionaries.\u2019\n\n4) Paul Anka wrote the lyrics at one o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\n\u2018I sat down at an old IBM electric typewriter and said to myself: \u201cIf Frank were writing this, what would he say?\u201d Then it came to me in a flash. He\u2019d say: \u201cI can\u2019t stand squealers. Plug that guy!\u201d But, on reflection, I thought that sounded too harsh. So then it came to me: \u201cAnd now, the end is near, so on your knees, fatso!\u201d And I thought, yeah, I\u2019m halfway there.\u2019\n\n5) While writing the lyrics, Paul Anka found it hard to come up with fresh rhymes for My Way.\n\nHaving exhausted both \u2018Byway\u2019 and \u2018Shy way\u2019, he tried \u2018Sly stray\u2019, \u2018Cry, prey!\u2019, \u2018I Pay\u2019, \u2018Sky Grey\u2019, \u2018Thigh spray\u2019, \u2018Die! Slay!\u2019 and \u2018Pie Tray\u2019, but none of them sent out quite the right message.\n\nMy Way topped the chart of popular funeral songs drawn up by Co-op Funeralcare, helping to push out traditional hymns from the top ten\n\n6) Musicologists continue to debate the line, \u2018I ate it up and spit it out\u2019. Some argue that \u2018it\u2019 refers to a stick of chewing gum, while others insist it was an undercooked Brussels sprout.\n\n7) On the strength of Sinatra\u2019s hit, Mai Wei was the most popular name for a newborn baby in Peking in 1970.\n\n8) Frank Sinatra reportedly disliked the song, and resented it becoming known worldwide as his signature tune. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t sing it again, if I had My Way,\u2019 he grumbled.\n\n9) The original French version of My Way is called Apres Vous, or \u2018After You\u2019, but Sinatra wanted it altered to something more appropriate to his character.\n\n10) At his Inaugural Ball, President Trump and First Lady Melania danced to the legendary song. Halfway through, the new President invited members of his administration, including Vice President Pence, to join in on a specially revised chorus: \u2018Your Way\u2019.\n\nAt his Inaugural Ball in January 2017, President Trump and First Lady Melania danced to the legendary song\n\n11) After a public vote, the town of Deference, in Arkansas, was recently renamed My Way.\n\nThe newly revised constituion of the town permits driving on whatever side of the road takes your fancy, the licence to burp, break wind and urinate in the street and, in the event that a park bench is full, the freedom to sit down on any stranger\u2019s lap. \u2018This is the meaning of true liberty,\u2019 says the Mayor of My Way, Loudon Kleer.\n\n12) After singing the first two lines of My Way, Frank Sinatra would sometimes be heckled by pedants.\n\n\u2018Tell me this, Frank,\u2019 they would yell. \u2018First, you mention having regrets, then you say you\u2019ve had too few to mention. So answer me this, Frank \u2014 why mention them, Frank? Why?\u2019\n\nRather than set aside valuable time for tackling this philosophical conundrum, Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes opted to have the pedants escorted from the concert hall or cabaret venue by trained operatives. The records show they would then be obliged to take the blows.\n\n13) In his recently published autobiography, David Cameron confessed to whistling My Way as he walked back into Number 10 following his resignation announcement. Boris Johnson has already made plans to do the same.", "description": "CRAIG BROWN: This year sees the 50th anniversary of the release of Frank Sinatra's famous single 'My Way'.
