Central Ave., Phoenix. | Haunted tale: San Carlos Hotel is said to be home to numerous ghostly events, most notably the ghost of Leone Jensen, who jumped off of the roof. There are contradictory accounts of how she died. While legend says she was a hopeless romantic who leaped to her death over a broken heart, others say in reality she was suffering from a long illness and wished to end her pain. (Photo: Pat Shannahan/The Republic)\n\nWith roughly an hour left in her young life, Leone Jensen took an envelope provided to guests by the Hotel San Carlos in Phoenix, and on the back penned a thoughtful apology to the manager.\n\nThe woman in her mid-20s, visiting from Los Angeles, didn\u2019t mean to check out permanently without paying the bill, she wrote in the early hours of May 7, 1928.\n\n\u201cThe coroner will attend to my bill and be sure all my clothes are packed,\u201d Jensen wrote. \u201cI have five dollars, which he will get later tonight. Will that help any? My income was due on the 10th, but it wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d\n\nShe wrote other notes \u2014 one with detailed requests for her funeral, others saying goodbye to friends \u2014 before ascending four stories to the hotel\u2019s roof atop the seventh floor. All would be on or near her shattered body, which was found on Monroe Street by the patrolmen who heard a scream and a thud at 2:45 a.m.\n\nIt was a tragic end for a woman, and the beginning of a ghost story that plays out today.\n\n'There's a chance of death': Extreme haunted tour employee explains their terrifying 40-page waiver\n\nMore: You can now stay in a giant guitar-shaped hotel that you have to see to believe\n\nJensen died a well-documented death thanks to newspaper reports at the time, which detailed her notes as well as her untimely end.\n\nIt's no wonder, then, that as guests and employees reported seeing a ghostly figure of a woman roaming the halls or appearing at the foot of beds, Jensen immediately came to mind, making her one of Arizona's most notable specters.\n\nHow the Hotel San Carlos got its ghost\n\nPhoenix city officials joined the community's elite on March 28, 1928, for the grand opening of the Hotel San Carlos, the finest accommodations in the Southwest at the time.\n\nBuilt at a cost of $850,000 (about $12.5 million today), the San Carlos was Phoenix's first high-rise hotel with air conditioning. Over the next few decades it would host celebrities and high-ranking politicians, and was the place to stay when visiting the desert.\n\nCentral Avenue, looking north from Adams Street toward the San Carlos Hotel and Westward Ho in Phoenix in 1937. (Photo: The Republic)\n\nThe hotel was just over a month old when Leone Jensen checked into a room on the third floor. She would have been just another guest if not for the decision she made on her second night.\n\nAccording to a May 8, 1928, story in the Arizona Republican, Jensen spent her final hour or so writing notes on hotel stationery as well as on the back of telegram blanks. The longest was to an undertaker in Los Angeles in which Jensen planned her own funeral.\n\n\u201cBury me in my tan dress and tan high-heeled slippers,\u201d she wrote in the missive that included the date and time, according to the Republican. \u201cOrgan music above all things. And can you arrange for two girls to sing, as I have never loved harmony, \u2018Nearer My God to Thee.\u2019 \u2026 Good-by and good luck. Think of me kindly.\u201d\n\nIn her last moments, Jensen addressed her reasons for the drastic action she was about to take. She noted various health problems including weakness and difficulty breathing, referencing a nervous breakdown.\n\n\"Just another lonesome and ill stranger,\" she wrote.\n\nThe tale has been embellished\n\nThis is far from the Leone Jensen tale told today during ghost tours, or in the many haunted-Phoenix stories that inevitably appear with each Halloween.\n\nThe story of a sad and lonesome woman who lost the will to live collapsed under the weight of much more tawdry tales of unrequited love, an abusive boyfriend and allegations of murder.\n\nIn the version repeated most often, Jensen traveled across the country to see her boyfriend, a bellboy at a neighboring hotel. The bellboy rebuffed her, if not beat her, and on that fateful morning she donned a formal evening gown and plunged to her death (if she wasn't pushed by the bellboy).\n\nHalloween 2019: Top 20 cities to celebrate, according to WalletHub\n\nMore: Stella Artois to release first-ever limited-edition, US holiday brew: Midnight Lager\n\nIf Jensen had a boyfriend, she made no mention of him in the letters she wrote before taking her life. Nor was she in an evening gown \u2014 the 1928 newspaper report said she was wearing a rose-colored dress \"of good material,\" light shoes and stockings, and a tan-colored summer coat.\n\nWhile the woman in white is not the hotel's only reputed spirit \u2014 disembodied giggles have been heard in the basement, said to be of children who died in the well that once was there \u2014 but she is its most famous.\n\nIf she exists at all. But that's another story.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2019/10/29/haunted-arizona-hotels-how-phoenix-hotel-san-carlos-got-its-ghost-leone-jensen/2494146001/", "description": "Tall tales to the contrary, Leone Jensen carefully planned her funeral and apologized to the hotel manager before stepping off the roof.", "authors": ["Scott Craven", "Published A.M.
