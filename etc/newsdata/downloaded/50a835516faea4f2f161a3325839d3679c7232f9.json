Why shouldn\u2019t they be? When you reach a certain age, you start seeing friends who break a hip quickly degrade toward ill health and death. It\u2019s a sudden, frightening, and serious health risk. Only one problem\u2014osteoporosis isn\u2019t to blame. Today, I want to tell you why you should relax a bit about osteoporosis. I\u2019ll also explore what you should actually be afraid of\u2014and what you can do to ensure your bones remain intact.\n\nIt\u2019s Not Bones, It\u2019s Balance\n\nThree Steps To Improved Brain Health And Balance\n\n1. Exercise\n\nThe vast majority of bone breaks in seniors aren\u2019t caused by osteoporosis. They\u2019re caused by falls. Of course, more brittle bones can break more easily. But most seniors with broken bones don\u2019t have osteoporosis. Rather, they suffer fractures because they are losing their balance. This is the true enemy. Your bones can be entirely healthy, but if you are unsteady on your feet, the density of your bones doesn\u2019t matter that much. Seniors in general are at greater risk for fractures because bone density decreases with age, whether or not osteoporosis is present. In other words, the true danger isn\u2019t in your bones, it\u2019s in your brain. That\u2019s because many seniors become less active as they grow older. And as they grow less active, the functionality of their brain decreases\u2014especially in regards to muscle control, spatial awareness, and balance. That\u2019s a recipe for falls. And it is those falls\u2014not osteoporosis\u2014that are the true killer.Fortunately, improving brain functionality can be easy. It can even be enjoyable. Let\u2019s look at the three most effective ways to regain your footing.You probably aren\u2019t surprised that exercising your body will help you find your balance. But you may be surprised what works best. It isn\u2019t Pilates. It isn\u2019t aerobics. It isn\u2019t even yoga. The best thing you can do to increase your proprioception\u2014your body awareness\u2014is to lift weights. You don\u2019t have to sling large amounts of iron. You just need to lift something. Even if that something is just the weight of your own body. This is extremely beneficial because lifting weight involves coordinating many different muscles groups. Doing a squat\u2014while holding weights, or not\u2014primarily involves your abs, your thighs, your glutes, and your back. Doing a push-up activates your abs, your biceps, your triceps, your glutes, and plenty of other muscles. Doing a chin-up uses every part of your arm, while your torso stabilizes. Doing a bicep curl alone only activates a couple groups\u2014which isn\u2019t all that helpful. But if you do a bicep curl while balancing on an inflated disc, you\u2019re coordinating all sorts of muscles together. Again, how much you lift isn\u2019t important. Your body weight alone is enough. What is important is that you involve as many muscle groups as possible in your exercise. And that you do it at least twice a week, so you can truly train your brain function. It\u2019s not about having a svelte build. It\u2019s about your neural pathways. Of course, if you want to do yoga too, I certainly won\u2019t discourage that.\n\n2. Be Active\n\n3. Eat Right\n\nIf you are committed to an exercise regimen, but you spend the rest of your time watching TV on the couch, you\u2019re undoing all your good practice. It\u2019s extremely important that you stay active. That means you should get up and move around at least once an hour . And once a day, you should take a long walk, a small jog, or swim for a bit in the pool. How you choose to move is entirely up to you. What matters is that you do move\u2014and you do so throughout the day. I have 80 year old patients who have better balance and body awareness than 40 year olds. What we sometimes excuse as aging is really atrophy of brain function, due to inactivity. You don\u2019t need to enter any ironman competitions, or run a marathon (although if you stay active, that can be an option your entire life). All you need to do is make sure you move around plenty each and every day.Eating healthy is one of the best ways to feed your brain, and keep it functioning at a high level. What does that mean? You should aim to consume plenty of healthy omega-3 oils, Vitamin D3, and curcumin. All do wonders for brain function . In addition, if you feel you\u2019re not getting enough brain nutrition, supplements can be very useful. There are certain peptides\u2014chemicals that activate our organs\u2014which our brain craves. Cerluten is a great example. The Russian military actually uses this to help treat brain injuries. And I\u2019ve seen it result in the first spoken words of an autistic child. And one of my colleagues, Dr. Vida, raved when she took a supplement rich in curcumin. She said she\u2019d never felt so aware or awake. Healthy eating is a great start. But many peptides like Cerluten aren\u2019t found in natural foods. Supplements are the only way to introduce more to your system. Look for a supplement that contains at least 200 mg of Cerluten. And try to get at least 500 mg curcumin each day. By combining healthy eating habits, exercise, an active routine, and supplements when warranted, you can eliminate balance problems\u2014during your senior years, or even when younger. So don\u2019t worry so much about osteoporosis, in yourself or those you love. Instead, focus on balance. If you don\u2019t fall, you won\u2019t break.", "description": "Most of my senior patients are worried about osteoporosis.\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn\u2019t .09/02/2019 3:12:01AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
