Training sessions in saunas. Cooling vests packed with ice. Air conditioners humming inside an outdoor stadium.\n\nCoaches, athletes and event organizers have been at their creative best in an attempt to beat the heat at world championships in Qatar. For 10 days, athletes will run, throw and jump in the desert, where the 100-degree temperatures (38 Celsius) and 70 percent humidity will be every bit as fierce as anyone they line up against.\n\nIt will be a track meet like no other - good practice for next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo, which is expected to be every bit as much of a sizzler - and quite a challenge for the nearly 2,000 participants descending on Doha to go for gold, silver and bronze in some of the most extreme conditions they\u2019ve ever faced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never raced in heat at this level,\u201d American marathoner Roberta Groner said.\n\nOrganizers scheduled both marathons - beginning with Friday\u2019s women\u2019s event - to start a minute before midnight, and for the race walks to kick off at 11:30 p.m., figuring that pounding the streets under floodlights was better than doing it under the broiling sun.\n\nThis week, the sea breeze kicking off the Persian Gulf has actually made it more humid at night - it was 90 degrees (32 C) with 69 percent humidity and a real-feel temperature of 104 (40 C) at midnight Thursday - and the question has now become whether they\u2019ve simply traded one problem for another.\n\n\u201cThe thing with these athletes, they don\u2019t know when to stop. They\u2019re too competitive,\u201d said associate professor of physiology Santiago Lorenzo, a former Olympic decathlete who has done studies on the effects of heat on athletes. \u201cThey\u2019ll keep running until they drop. So the organizing committee, they have to make sure they think about the safety of their runners.\u201d\n\nIAAF president Sebastian Coe bristled at the notion that taking world championships to the desert in September was folly, and wouldn\u2019t bite when asked about speculation that more than half of Friday night\u2019s 70-woman field might not finish the race. He said there will be more water, and more medical staff, on the course. Everyone will be keeping a keen eye open for signs of dehydration, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\n\u201cWe want as many people to finish in as good a shape as possible,\u201d Coe said. \u201cThe medical team will be very alert. The heat is not the big issue. Anyone who has run or competed knows you can deal with heat, but humidity is a challenge.\u201d\n\nQatar retrofitted Khalifa International Stadium, an open-roof venue, with air conditioning - one piece of this country\u2019s plan to become a big-time host of major sporting events. The World Cup soccer tournament will be there in three years, and the track championships will offer an instructive glimpse into how the system works at one of Doha\u2019s crown-jewel venues.\n\n\u201cIt was very, very nice in here compared to the walk from the car into the stadium,\u201d American steeplechaser Emma Coburn said during a news conference Wednesday inside the 48,000-seat stadium.\n\nIndeed, temperatures inside are a good 20 degrees cooler than in the parking lot.\n\nAnd still, adjustments are being made.\n\nOne example comes from an unlikely place: Shot putter Ryan Crouser said he\u2019s been running hot water over the shots before he brings them outside for practice so they won\u2019t get slick with condensation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been heating them up to 100 degrees to get them above the dew point,\u201d Crouser said.\n\nThe U.S. and other countries are keeping ice-filled cooling vests at the ready, while some teams are sending their athletes into saunas as part of a training regimen designed to prepare them for the conditions.\n\nAfter a recent practice, distance runner Molly Huddle posted a picture of the readings on her phone.\n\nHumidity: 80%. Dew point: 83%. Feels like: 112 F (44 C).\n\nThe time was 9:32 p.m.\n\nAlso on social media, a tweet from Nigerian discus thrower Chioma Onyekwere: \u201cHeading to my first practice in Doha. Hoping the heat won\u2019t be the end of me.\u201d\n\nThe IAAF has done away with its tradition of holding both day and night sessions, instead choosing to pack all the action into the evening hours and avoid the daytime highs, which can still approach 105 (40 C), even in early fall.\n\nNobody will stay up later than the marathoners.\n\nAmerican Andrew Epperson, an assistant cross country coach at Colorado State, will keep his body clock on Colorado time, traveling to Doha only a few days before the men\u2019s marathon, which takes place Oct. 5. He\u2019s been practicing at 3 p.m. in Colorado - when it\u2019s midnight in Doha. His plan is to not adjust to the local time, and instead just fly in, stay on his normal time and then compete.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty familiar with humidity and burning and some warm conditions,\u201d Epperson cracked. He grew up in Houston.\n\nMeanwhile, Groner, the American marathoner who races Friday night, wore tights and two long-sleeved shirts on her recent training runs in New Jersey.\n\nThankfully, headlamps won\u2019t be required. The marathon course is set on a well-lit, looped path along the waterfront of Doha. The backdrop is the city\u2019s tableau of futuristic skyscrapers, giving the TV cameras a chance to capture some cool looking scenery despite the stifling heat.\n\nBack inside the stadium, the air conditioning will run full steam during the day to keep things cool, then be turned off when actual competition starts, lest the currents affect the sprinters, or blow a javelin or discus off line.\n\nDifferent, for sure. But not enough to faze high jumper Vashti Cunningham. She trains in the desert climes of Las Vegas and recently won the U.S. title during a broiling weekend in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s hotter to come,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\nTrack at the Tokyo Olympics starts July 31, 2020. The temperature there on July 31, 2019 was 95 degrees (35 C).\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Marathons at midnight.
