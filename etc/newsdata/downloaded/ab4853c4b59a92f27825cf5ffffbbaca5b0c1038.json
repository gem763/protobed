Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in the 2020 Democratic primary.\n\nThe 32-year-old revealed his HIV-positive status in a New York Times profile last week, ahead of the Sept. 24 release of his memoir. Then, during an interview Wednesday, Van Ness told Build Series that he realized he had a \u201csignificant role to play\u201d and a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to support people living with HIV after publicly sharing his status. (Both Build Series and HuffPost are a part of Verizon Media.)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren for president,\u201d the \u201cQueer Eye\u201d star said. He revealed that his support for her was cemented after a difficult experience seeking medication last month.\n\nVan Ness said he misplaced his daily HIV medication while he was traveling between New York and Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cI just was not thinking, so I left my medicine in New York City and I got to Philly and realized I didn\u2019t have my medication,\u201d he said.\n\nHe visited a pharmacy late at night and, after dealing with his insurance company, had to pay $3,500 for the prescription. He was frustrated, both by the inconvenience of being unable to simply get a single replacement pill, and by the high cost, which he would have been unable to afford three years ago.\n\n\u201cHow the fuck do I have $3,500 sitting around in my fucking checking account?\u201d Van Ness added, noting three years ago \u2014 before he appeared on \u201cQueer Eye\u201d \u2014 his financial situation was much different.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that skipping dosages could give \u201cHIV the chance to multiply rapidly,\u201d which could weaken the immune system, and goes on to say that in most cases individuals who miss a dose can \u201ctake the medicines as soon as you can ... (unless your pharmacist or health care provider has told you something different).\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Van Ness tweeted about his support for Warren, writing that health care \u201cshouldn\u2019t be for profit, ever, it\u2019s a human right.\u201d\n\nThe moment I knew I was endorsing @ewarren was last month when I misplaced my HIV meds. It cost $3500 to replace them out of pocket with \u201camazing\u201d plantinum level insurance. Healthcare shouldn\u2019t be for profit ever, it\u2019s a human right. \u2014 Jonathan Van Ness (@jvn) September 25, 2019\n\nVan Ness then tweeted a video of a phone call he had with Warren, in which he describes how impressed he was with her remarks on health care at the Democratic debate on Sept. 12, where the candidate also discussed high prescription drug costs.\n\nWarren supports the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), which would provide all Americans health care through the government.\n\nShe has received some criticism for not releasing her own health care plan and, when asked after the debate if she is going to, Warren said, \u201cI support Medicare for All, I think it\u2019s a good plan. ... Other things that people have come up with, when they\u2019re good plans, let\u2019s do it. This isn\u2019t some kind of contest, \u2018I gotta think of mine first,\u2019 it\u2019s what best for the American people.\u201d\n\nInsurance companies make a profit by denying necessary health care for millions of people. It's not right\u2014and it's why I'm fighting for #MedicareForAll. Thank you for being a part of this fight, @jvn, and for your courage to speak your truth. We're going to do this together. https://t.co/17qK88HZ26 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 25, 2019\n\nIn his Build Series interview, Van Ness addressed the dangers of HIV stigmatization, noting that there\u2019s \u201cso much more work to be done.\u201d\n\nHe said he reads stories of people \u201cdying from HIV/AIDS-related deaths all over the world, due to lack of treatment, stigmatization, no access to facilities...\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I was in one of those places, the person that people love so much, the ball of sunshine ... If I was born 20 years before I was born there\u2019s a really good chance that I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said.", "description": "The \"Queer Eye\" star said he was inspired to support the senator after he paid $3,500 to replace his HIV medication last month.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8cea1d1e00002f00735f4f.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
