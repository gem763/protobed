This signals Cointelegraph\u2019s continued expansion as we open our new headquarters in Istanbul.\n\nTurkish editor Erhan Kahraman will lead the charge, building a team that delivers relevant news to the crypto and blockchain communities in this part of the world. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWith a population of 82 million people, this country bordering the Mediterranean and Black Seas is an established early adopter for cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. According to a report by Statista, 20% of Turks are familiar with crypto in one way or another. We expect that level of awareness to quickly ramp up, and Turkey is becoming a point of interest for crypto players around the world.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of evidence to confirm it. Major crypto companies are setting up shop there, and the Turkish government last month teased plans to unveil its own national cryptocurrency. This region is clearing becoming more important within crypto, not less important. Industry leaders are gathering under the umbrella of Blockchain Turkey Platform to research and develop common blockchain practices.\n\n\u201cCointelegraph Turkish will expand the global presence of Cointelegraph in the region,\u201d said Erhan Kahraman, Cointelegraph Turkish Editor. \u201cThe Turkish version aims to create a local knowledge base for newcomers to the crypto community, while also covering breaking news from around the globe, price analysis, and market updates for veteran traders.\u201d\n\nTurkey will join Cointelegraph\u2019s existing bureaus in Germany, Italy, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Spain, and Serbia.
