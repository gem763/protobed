This would let it switch iPhone sales from a transactional model to a subscription model, potentially driving the stock price up without having to increase product sales or prices dramatically.\n\nDuring Wednesday's earnings call, when analyst Toni Sacconagi asked about the idea of a prime subscription, Apple CEO Tim Cook did not shoot down the idea. In fact, he suggested that something like it was already in effect.\n\n\"In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they're on upgrade plans and so forth,\" Cook said during an earnings call. \"So to some degree that exists today.\"\n\nCook went on to say that Apple sees it as a major growth area, using bullish language.\n\n\"My perspective is that will grow in the future to larger numbers. It will grow disproportionately,\" he continued.", "description": "Apple could bundle hardware upgrades with services like iCloud storage or Apple TV+ content and hardware.", "authors": ["Kif Leswing"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106157443-1569923301559gettyimages-1172303092.jpeg?v=1570807576", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
