Despite McConaughey\u2019s miraculous resurrection, Galifianakis is charged by boss Will Ferrell to create ten new episodes as recompense. Hijinks ensue.\n\nThe clip has a Jackass: The Movie je ne sais quoi, but physical pain is substituted for manufactured cringe as Galifianakis deliberately shits on his A-list guests.\n\nExpect the flick to include stars like Keanu Reeves, Brie Larson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tessa Thompson, John Legend, and Chrissy Teigen, who may or may not seduce Galifianakis at a bar.\n\nBetween Two Ferns: The Movie hits Netflix on September 20.
