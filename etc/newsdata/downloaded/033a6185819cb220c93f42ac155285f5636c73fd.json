FICO, the score used most by lenders, ranges from a low of 300 to a high of 850.\n\nIn FICO\u2019s credit-scoring model, the top two factors that determine your score are your payment history and the amount you owe. Let\u2019s explore the latter.\n\nAD\n\nThirty percent of your credit score is made up of how you manage debt or your \u201ccredit utilization.\u201d This just means what percentage of your available credit is being used or borrowed.\n\nAD\n\nFICO, the company that produces the score by the same name, says its formula views consumers who are constantly maxing out their credit cards or exceeding their credit limit as a potential risk.\n\nOkay, so you might ask: How much of my available balance should I be using?\n\nI\u2019ve been told by numerous experts that consumers should have a credit utilization rate of no more than 30 percent. So, for example, if your credit card limit was $1,000, you should keep your balance to $300. This suggested guideline would apply for each individual credit card and the overall utilization for all your cards.\n\nAD\n\nBut the truth is that 30 percent ceiling isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule baked into the scoring programs.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing significant about 30 percent revolving utilization. It\u2019s relative,\u201d said Ethan Dornhelm, vice president of scores and predictive analytics at FICO.\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, if you\u2019re striving for a perfect 850 credit score, you should aim for single-digit credit utilization.\n\nDornhelm said recent company research has shown that the highest-scoring 25 percent of U.S. consumers \u2014 those with a FICO score above 795 \u2014 use, on average, 7 percent of their credit limit. The average revolving utilization for consumers with a perfect 850 credit score was 4.1 percent.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUsing a high percentage of your available credit means you're close to maxing out your credit cards, which can have a negative impact on your FICO score,\u201d Dornhelm said. \u201cOn the other hand, using a low percentage of your available credit can have a positive impact. In some cases, a low credit card utilization ratio will have a more positive impact on your FICO Scores than not using any of your available credit at all.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis question about credit utilization often leads to one of the biggest myths about paying off your credit card. Here\u2019s a recent question from a reader.\n\nQ: Why does everybody constantly say to pay off the credit card every month? If I did this, it would never hit my credit report, and it would be like I\u2019m not using it at all. Am I missing something here?\n\nAD\n\nDornhelm: \u201cOne of the biggest misconceptions about FICO score is that you have to carry a balance on your credit cards and not pay off your credit card balances in full to build a credit history. This is not true. Carrying balances from month to month and incurring interest fees does NOT help your score. Instead, what matters to the FICO score is that you are keeping the balances reported in your credit file (typically your credit card statement balance), relatively low, especially in comparison to your credit limits.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s more myth-busting on the paying off of balances from two additional credit experts:\n\nJeff Richardson, vice president and group head for marketing and communications for VantageScore Solutions. VantageScore is the scoring model created by the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.\n\nAD\n\nAmy Thomann, head of consumer credit education at TransUnion.\n\nThomann: \u201cPaying off your credit card balance each month is a good idea, because it will prevent your account from being delinquent plus prevent any finance charges or late fees. Always keep in mind the foundational principles of credit health. It\u2019s imperative to pay any bills on time and in full each month and maintain a low credit utilization ratio.\u201d\n\nRichardson: \u201cIf you pay your credit card balances completely each month, it will reflect positively in your credit score. The credit score rewards an open and active account in good standing with a zero balance. Despite paying off the balance, a lender continues to report usage because there is activity occurring even though the balance is zero. By contrast, if you have a credit card with no activity (such as a backup credit card that you keep in a drawer for emergencies), the lender may stop reporting on the account due to inactivity. The inactive account will have less positive impact on credit score compared to an active account in good standing with no/low utilization. One suggestion would be to use a credit card such as this to autopay for a small subscription such as one\u2019s streaming video account, which will keep the account and credit line open.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe moral of this credit score lesson: Have good credit, but don\u2019t use much of it.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe percentage of consumers with a perfect 850 credit score is up slightly.
