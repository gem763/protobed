Prices traded lower before finding support at the contract's 200-day moving average.\n\nCBOT December corn was up 5-3/4 cents at $3.92-3/4 a bushel.\n\nCBOT December soft red winter wheat was up 5-1/2 cents a bushel at $4.94-3/4, turning higher after early weakness pushed it near its 20-day moving average.\n\nThe storm was expected to drop between six and 12 inches of snow in major crop production states such as North Dakota, Minnesota and South Dakota, forecaster Commodity Weather Group said.\n\nUnharvested crops nearing maturity could be knocked over and damaged during the storm, the forecaster said. Further south, rain will push farmers from their fields.\n\nIn its weekly crop update on Monday afternoon, the USDA said 15% of the corn crop had been harvested as of Oct. 6, below analysts' forecasts and lower than the average pace of 27%.\n\nOn the soybean crop, the USDA said 14% had been harvested, slightly behind market forecasts. The five-year average is 34%.\n\nTraders were waiting for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) latest crop forecasts, which will be released on Thursday.\n\n\"All eyes are on whether the USDA shaves its U.S. corn yield forecast again,\" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nThe market has become more sensitive to any setbacks in harvest yields after the USDA put quarterly stocks of corn and soybeans below expectations in a report at the end of September.
