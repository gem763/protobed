(AP Photo/Michel Euler)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 An international monitoring agency has given Pakistan four months to prove it is fighting terrorism financing and money laundering \u2014 or it could be put on a damaging global blacklist.\n\nThe Financial Action Task Force also threatened Iran, which is already blacklisted, with even tougher restrictions on its international financial activity.\n\nThe FATF's announcement Friday on Pakistan offers a reprieve to Prime Minister Imran Khan as he works to shore up his country's faltering economy and attract foreign investment and loans.\n\nBut the agency's assessment remained grim, expressing \"serious concerns with the overall lack of progress by Pakistan\" to stop terrorism financing.\n\nIn a statement after meetings this week at its Paris headquarters, the FATF said Pakistan has addressed only five of 27 measures required to avoid being blacklisted.\n\nIf Pakistan doesn't act by February, FATF president Xiangmin Lui said the agency could put the country on its blacklist, which currently includes only Iran and North Korea.\n\nExperts say the move means every international financial transaction with Pakistan will be closely scrutinized, and doing business in Pakistan will become costly and cumbersome. International agencies could place restrictions on lending money to Pakistan, including key creditors such as the International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.\n\n\"Pakistan has not done enough,\" Xiangmin told a news conference.\n\nPakistan should do more to track money transfers and investigate and prosecute terrorism financiers, the FATF said.\n\nMeanwhile, it expressed \"disappointment\" that Iran isn't taking the necessary steps to be removed from the blacklist and said it's asking all member countries to tighten scrutiny of any financial transactions involving Iran.\n\nVirtual currencies such as bitcoin and Facebook's Libra are also prompting concern from the FATF, which warned of \"new risks\" from such products. It said they're being \"closely monitored\" to ensure they're not used to finance terrorism or launder money.\n\n___\n\nMunir Ahmed in Islamabad contributed.", "description": "An international monitoring agency has given Pakistan four months to prove it is fighting terrorism financing and money laundering \u2014 or it could be put on a damaging global blacklist.
