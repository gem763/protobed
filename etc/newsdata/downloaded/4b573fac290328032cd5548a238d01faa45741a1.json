I\u2019ve quietly believed that Cub Sport is like a next-generation Savage Garden so having this collab exist in reality, right here and right now, in front of my salad, is a fucken treat.\n\nPotentially a passing of the torch happening here, and I\u2019m extremely about it.\n\nThe track itself is a little more subdued and mellow; not the kind of 2am saucy party bangers that we\u2019ve come to love from Cubbies, but instead featuring a fuzzy guitar before dropping into a solid Latin rumba beat with Hayes and Tim Nelson\u2019s complimenting vocals layered over the top.\n\nIt\u2019s honeyed and warm and feels like a big moment of reassurance, support, and \u201chey, I\u2019ve been there too\u201d from Cubbies to younger folk in the LGBT community, who the track is speaking to.\n\nIt\u2019s a confirmed bop, and I\u2019m crossing all my fingers and toes that the video clip will be reminiscent of the top-tier work from late 90s Savage Garden era. I\u2019m talking co-ordinating outfits, wet-look hair, long leather trenchcoats, weird dystopian visuals that make like no connection to the actual song whatsoever. The whole nine yards.\n\nIt\u2019s also the first music that Darren Hayes has released in SEVEN YEARS, so thank you, kind Sir, it\u2019s nice to have your pipes back.\n\nIt's been 7 years since I released any music. Recently, the magical @CubSport invited me to guest vocal on their gorgeous new song and when you hear it you'll understand why I couldn't resist. It's transcendent. Comes out Thursday. https://t.co/dTDU8MB2SJ \u2014 Darren Hayes (@darrenhayes) October 15, 2019\n\n\u2018I Never Cried\u2026\u2019 is the entry to a new era of Cub Sport, and if this is what they\u2019re dishing up first thing, I can\u2019t wait to see what they\u2019ve got up their sleeves.\n\nCheck out the song below and just take a moment to consider how much Darren Hayes is like, the perfect inclusion.", "description": "The collab of my dreams has happened, with Darren Hayes stepping into the studio with Cub Sport, and essentially producing Savage Garden 2.0.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/cub-sport-2019-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
