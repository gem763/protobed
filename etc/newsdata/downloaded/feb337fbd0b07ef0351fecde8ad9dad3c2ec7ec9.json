Martinez is considering using Raudy Read during a three-game series against the Atlanta Braves. Washington also called up Tres Barrera on Sunday to provide additional insurance at the position.\n\nAD\n\nRead could make sense Saturday because he has familiarity with that day\u2019s starting pitcher, Austin Voth. The pair worked together this season with Class AAA Fresno. It would also be a logical time to get Gomes some rest because the 32-year-old has started six straight games \u2014 and counting \u2014 since Suzuki first felt elbow pain after subbing in against the Braves in Atlanta. The 35-year-old Suzuki has since felt discomfort while swinging and has yet to resume batting practice.\n\nAD\n\nHow the Nationals\u2019 rotation lines up for the rest of the regular season \u2014 and beyond\n\nSuzuki\u2019s absence is felt the most in the lineup. He has been solid hitting sixth and seventh and has been particularly productive with two outs and runners in scoring position (1.214 on-base-plus slugging percentage in 39 plate appearances in that situation). He has, however, struggled managing the base paths and hurt his elbow while throwing to second base. Suzuki has thrown out just five of the 50 runners this season, a 10 percent success rate.\n\nThe Nationals are scheduled to play the Twins at Target Field at 7:40 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday. But with storms in the forecast for most of the night, and the sky leaking rain all day, it\u2019s going to be tough to get the game in. Since the teams don\u2019t have a mutual off day for the rest of the season, it could be rescheduled for Sept. 30 in case the matchup holds postseason implications. Yet Major League Baseball, who makes all weather decisions this time of year, is expected to avoid that scenario at all costs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just watching right now, and we have to get ready to play,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying it\u2019s going to break up, so we never tell the boys we\u2019re not going to play. We want them to be ready. It\u2019s full steam ahead and Pat Corbin is in there today.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGomes has caught each of Corbin\u2019s starts this season. It makes sense, given their connection, for him to be back behind the plate Thursday. But he will need a break if Suzuki remains out, and that\u2019s when Read or Barrera will come in. Martinez favors Read because the 25-year-old has some big league experience and a lot of pop in his bat. Barrera, 24, has yet to appear in the majors, but is touted as a very solid defensive catcher.\n\nWhoever winds up behind the plate, and whenever that comes, they will be thrown right into a pennant race. Washington has a slight lead over the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers in the National League wild card standings. And, more than anything, they need Suzuki back and healthy for the stretch run.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYan is in great shape,\u201d Martinez said when asked how many consecutive days Gomes could play. \u201cI definitely want to get one of the other two guys in there, possibly one game this weekend, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLINEUPS\n\nNationals (80-64)\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick DH\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera 2B\n\nMatt Adams 1B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nPatrick Corbin P\n\nTwins (89-56)\n\nMitch Garver C\n\nLuis Arraez LF\n\nNelson Cruz DH\n\nEddie Rosario RF\n\nC.J.
