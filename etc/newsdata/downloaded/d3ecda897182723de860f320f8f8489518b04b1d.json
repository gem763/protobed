It recently launched an enhanced recommendation engine that now accounts for not just what you watch, but also when. And today, it\u2019s introducing the first of what will be many more personalization-focused improvements, with the addition of Like and Dislike buttons. These will allow you to give Hulu direct feedback about your interests, the company says.\n\nThe new buttons will appear across Hulu\u2019s content, including on the title\u2019s Details page right above the plus (+) button where you can add the show or movie to your watchlist (aka \u201cMy Stuff.\u201d) On living room devices, you\u2019ll see the buttons on all Details pages. On the web, you\u2019ll see the buttons on any show, movie or program on the Home page for now, with support for Details pages coming soon, Hulu tells us.\n\nThe buttons will also be accessible on some of the content recommended across Hulu\u2019s main interface, so you can share your likes and dislikes as you\u2019re browsing for something new to watch.\n\nWhen you like a movie or TV show, Hulu will show you more titles and shows that are similar. And when you \u201cDislike\u201d a show or movie, Hulu won\u2019t show you that title again.\n\nThe latter option, the \u201cDislike,\u201d is similar to another feature Hulu had been developing. At its Upfronts presentation last year, Hulu introduced a \u201cStop Suggesting\u201d feature that would stop Hulu from recommending a title you didn\u2019t want to see.\n\nBut \u201cStop Suggesting\u201d wasn\u2019t an explicit signal that you hated something \u2014 it could mean you\u2019ve already watched that show elsewhere, for example. It could have meant you liked the show, but didn\u2019t want people to know that, because it\u2019s a little embarrassing \u2014 like some trashy reality TV. Or it may have just meant you felt neutral about the title in question, but wanted it out of your recommendations to make room for better suggestions.\n\nHulu confirmed with us that the new Like / Dislike buttons will replace this Stop Suggesting feature going forward.\n\nThe new Like and Dislike buttons are rolling out today to Hulu.com, Amazon Fire TV devices, XboxOne, Nintendo Switch, select LG, Samsung and Android TVs, VIZIO SmartCast TVs and Chromecast, with other devices coming soon.\n\nThe buttons are only one of many new features Hulu has in the works.\n\nIt\u2019s also working on a new, personalized homepage for viewers that will display the most relevant collections for you and order them based on your watch preferences.\n\nThe homescreen is an area where Hulu, to be frank, has been lacking in recent years.\n\nFor instance, the company said in January it would drop the confusing landing page called \u201cLineup\u201d in order to simplify navigation. It then followed through later in the year by doing just that. Lineup had never made much sense to Hulu end users. It wasn\u2019t clear if it was some sort of personalized section or a list of things Hulu wanted to promote or some combination of both.\n\nHulu\u2019s plans for its revamped homescreen make it sound like it will go more in the direction of Netflix, as it will feature sections dedicated to the user\u2019s favorite shows and movies alongside a number of content collections personalized to what that person actually watches. For example, animation fans would see an animation section higher on their page, while those who never watch family movies or kids shows would see a kids content collection ranked much lower.\n\nHulu said it will also roll out more improvements to its recommendation engine to make the collections it suggests more reflective of what you\u2019ve watched in the past. And it will refine its suggestions for content that\u2019s \u201cUp Next.\u201d\n\nIn addition, an editorial team will work to identify any \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d items \u2014 like breaking news or trending shows \u2014 and place those at the top of the algorithmically driven recommendations.\n\nFinally, Hulu says it\u2019s working on a better search experience that will be more useful when you typo or misspell things, or if you use common abbreviations \u2014 like HIMYM for \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d for example.\n\nThe company already tested this with \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and was able to identify and correct more than 1,500 unique misspellings, it says.\n\n\u201cWe know that today\u2019s connected consumers expect a deeply personalized experience when they watch TV. At Hulu, we\u2019ve always taken a unique approach to recommendations,\u201d said Jason Wong, director, Product Management at Hulu, in an announcement about the changes. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of human curation, empowering our viewers, and algorithms that round out the personalized experiences we deliver to Hulu subscribers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe changes are being introduced ahead of the launches of two highly anticipated new streaming services, Disney+ (Disney is also the majority owner of Hulu) and Apple TV+. It\u2019s unclear how consumers will adapt to the expanded choice in streaming \u2014 especially with HBO Max and NBCU\u2019s streaming service, Peacock, on the horizon. Existing streaming services are enhancing their products in advance of these launches with the hopes of better retaining their viewers. Netflix, for example, recently added a \u201ccoming soon\u201d-type section to encourage users to stay subscribed.\n\nThe new Like / Dislike buttons are arriving starting today, but Hulu didn\u2019t give a timeline for the other changes, beyond noting they\u2019re \u201ccoming soon.\u201d", "description": "Hulu says it\u2019s working on several product changes to make its service more personalized to viewers.
