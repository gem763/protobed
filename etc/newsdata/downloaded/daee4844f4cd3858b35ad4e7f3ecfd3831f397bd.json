REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nNew South Wales farmer Ross Wild was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma last year after using the weedkiller Roundup on his farming property near the border of NSW and Victoria since 1976, ABC reported.\n\nHe says long-term exposure to Roundup\u2019s active ingredient, glyphosate, was to blame, ABC said.\n\nReuters could not immediately trace contact details for Wild.\n\nA Bayer spokesman said the company was aware of media reports regarding a statement claim about glyphosate but had not yet been served a writ.\n\n\u201cWe have great sympathy for any individual with cancer, but the extensive body of science on glyphosate-based herbicides over four decades supports the conclusion that Roundup does not cause Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (NHL),\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe spokesman said glyphosate had been extensively studied by scientists and regulators, and research had confirmed it was not carcinogenic.\n\n\u201cWe firmly stand behind the safety of glyphosate-based products, and as a company devoted to life sciences, assure Australians that their health and the environment are our top priority.\u201d\n\nWild will be represented by managing partner Tony Carbone of Carbone Lawyers, according to the report. The firm did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nGlyphosate is the world\u2019s most widely used weedkiller. Monsanto\u2019s Roundup was the first glyphosate-based weedkiller but is no longer patent-protected and many other versions are now available. Bayer does not provide sales figures for the product.\n\nThe company said in a statement that as of July 11, it faced lawsuits brought by roughly 18,400 U.S. plaintiffs who say glyphosate caused cancer.\n\nA trial over the weedkiller scheduled to begin on Oct. 15 in Missouri had been delayed, Bayer said this month.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several to be put on hold as mediator Ken Feinberg tries to negotiate a settlement between the company and U.S. plaintiffs after a California jury in August last year found that Monsanto should have warned of alleged cancer risks.", "description": "An Australian farmer has launched a legal action against Bayer AG's agricultural chemicals unit Monsanto after being diagnosed with a type of cancer he says was caused by its weedkiller, Australia's national broadcaster said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439220258&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990T8", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
