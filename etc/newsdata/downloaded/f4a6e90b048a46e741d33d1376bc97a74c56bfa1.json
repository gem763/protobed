But other issues remain. The worst problem that my colleagues at The Verge and I have experienced is that an iPhone on iOS 13 can sometimes drop data, yet continue to show full bars as if everything is fine. This usually happens after I\u2019ve come up from the subways here in New York. Toggling airplane mode or cellular data isn\u2019t enough to fix it; only powering the phone off and on again gets things running normally again.", "description": "Apple has released iOS 13.1.1 for iPhone and iPads, and the update includes a number of bug fixes including one for battery drain.
