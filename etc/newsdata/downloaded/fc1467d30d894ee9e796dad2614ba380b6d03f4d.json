But it has just surfaced perhaps its most charged topic yet: What propels someone to pick up a gun and begin killing complete strangers?\n\nThe film is \u201cJoker,\u201d and while it comes in the form of a comic-book movie, it is the opposite of light.\n\n\"Set aside that it\u2019s the DC [Comics] universe,\u201d Cameron Bailey, artistic director of the festival, said in an interview. \u201cJust think of it as a great character study that goes really dark.\u201d\n\nToronto was the first proving ground for \u201cJoker,\u201d which Warner Bros. brought to the festival hoping to launch an award-winning run for a film that has become one of Hollywood\u2019s most closely watched and potentially explosive movies in years \u2014 a study of a man coming unhinged, carrying out random acts of deadly violence and igniting a populist revolution.\n\n\u201cJoker,\u201d which will be released in theaters Oct. 4, has proved to be divisive, not just because of the traditional range of aesthetic opinions but because of what the movie represents and the speculation about which political group will commandeer it \u2014 the Hollywood release as political weapon.\n\nThe movie focuses on the pre-Joker Arthur Fleck, circa early 1980s Gotham \u2014 a sad-sack clown slowly unraveling under his troubles and finding solace in a gun and mask \u2014 and becoming a folk hero in the process. It stars Joaquin Phoenix and is improbably directed by Todd Phillips, the filmmaker behind the \"Hangover\u201d comedies.\n\nThe stakes are high for Warner Bros., whose DC Extended Universe has struggled to land phenomena at anywhere near the consistency of Disney\u2019s rival Marvel Cinematic Universe (with only one release, \u201cAquaman,\u201d of more than $1 billion in global box office to Marvel\u2019s nine).\n\nThat \u201cJoker\u201d won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival just last week \u2014 Warner Bros. is the first major Hollywood studio in the modern era to win the prize \u2014 ups the ante. The victory leapfrogs it ahead of Disney, which earlier this year became the first studio to notch a best picture Oscar nomination for a comic-book movie (\u201cBlack Panther\"). With a relatively modest $55 million budget and a large marketing campaign planned, \u201cJoker\u201d is an attempt to notch one for the AT&T subsidiary as it seeks to compete with the market leader.\n\nBut the talk at this festival, which more than any other gathering sets the tone for Hollywood\u2019s all-important Oscar season to follow, shows that the stakes are a lot higher than even the battle for corporate bragging rights.\n\nSome commentators have vigorously decried \u201cJoker\u2019s\u201d message. Time\u2019s Stephanie Zacharek wrote that Phoenix\u2019s character \u201ccould easily be adopted as the patron saint of incels,\u201d she wrote, referring to the \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d group of frustrated males whose beliefs have come up in several mass killings.\n\n\u201cIn America, there\u2019s a mass shooting or attempted act of violence by a guy like Arthur practically every other week. And yet we\u2019re supposed to feel some sympathy for Arthur.\" The film \u201clionizes and glamorizes\u201d the character, she wrote. She concluded that \u201cthere\u2019s a sick joke in there somewhere. Unfortunately, it\u2019s on us.\u201d\n\nZacharek and those who disagree with her view have been confronting the essential questions surrounding the movie: by peering so closely at a killer, is Phillips trying to understand his mind or glorify his thinking? Indict the mental-health system that failed him or cheer that he broke free from conventionality?\n\nAt the post-screening party Monday night, a debate broke out among journalists and industry executives over whether the movie could become part of the texts cited by potential future mass shooters, and what that would mean. Even if the causation between media violence and the real-world shootings is statistically unproven, a few asked, couldn\u2019t the movie still become part of the problematic context for them?\n\nWarner Bros is understandably eager to play down any such talk. That\u2019s in part because the current climate has led rivals to cancel movies \u2014 Universal Pictures, most recently, scrapping \u201cThe Hunt\u201d after last month\u2019s shootings in Ohio and Texas. Any future tragedies could lead to similar pressure on Warner.\n\nBut it\u2019s also because the studio is no stranger to the debate about the relationship between superhero-villain violence and the real-world kind. The company was behind the release of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d \u2014 the movie that was playing at an Aurora, Colo., theater when a gunman opened fire in July 2012, killing 12 people. The shooter cited the movie as an intentional choice.\n\nWarner may have little ability to quell the speculation, though. At the Venice premiere, a moviegoer approached Phillips and said he thought Paris would burn as a result of the movie. Phillips maintains that the goal is not to make Fleck a hero as his actions become more violent. As the director has said, he has simply chosen to make a grittier movie about a villain than has been made before.\n\n\u201cHow do you make a movie with white face and green hair and run it through as realistic [a] lens as possible?\u201d Phillips said after the screening. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t believe you fall into a vat of acid and are turned that way,\u201d he said, referring to what the comic books say about how the Joker character was created.\n\nThose with a long memory have also been recalling the moment 30 years ago when two reviewers warned that Spike Lee\u2019s conclusion of \u201cDo The Right Thing,\u201d in which a black character tossed a garbage can through the window of a white-owned pizzeria, sparking a violent confrontation with police, was \u201cdynamite under every seat,\u201d as Newsweek\u2019s Jack Kroll said at the time. David Denby of New York magazine even wrote that Lee would be partly responsible \u201cif some audiences go wild.\"\n\nThat moment has since become an example of cringeworthy mischaracterization of and overreaction to social violence on screen. Warner executives are eager to make the comparison.\n\nIn case none of this seems timely or charged enough, the film has the chance to plunge itself into the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOne theory, already advanced by liberals, is that the Joker shares commonalities with President Trump, fueled as he is by a brittle ego and love of performing and crowds. (A subplot involves Fleck appearing on a popular late-night show). Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver wrote the movie in 2017, shortly after Trump took office, so the camp could make a case for the timing.\n\nMeanwhile, the revolution Fleck\u2019s actions unintentionally set off \u2014 an eat-the-rich mob unleashes to overthrow the banking system \u2014 is fraught with unclear political symbolism. The mob could be either Republican Trump voters or Occupy Wall Street progressives. And that will probably weaponize the movie politically \u2014 both the right and the left can use it to demonstrate bad acting by the other side.\n\n\u201cThere is something for bad people to admire here, but there is also a lot of things people can use to say what\u2019s bad about the other side,\" said one industry member, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid the appearance of weighing in on the film.\n\nFrom the moment the screening ended, the debate was on over whether Phillips had made a brilliantly inscrutable work or a movie as elastic as the protagonist\u2019s face. People could agree on only one thing: \u201cJoker\u201d is coming, as unavoidable as a clown mask.", "description": "Nearly a month before release, Joker is becoming the most discussed -- and controversial -- movie of the fall after its Toronto International Film Festival premiere", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S.", "September At Am", "Steven Zeitchik Covers The Business Of Entertainment For The Washington Post", "Examining The Industry'S Trends", "Challenges", "Issues", "Ideas.
