Gary Woodland enters the third round at 10 under, followed by Keegan Bradley at Hideki Matsuyama T-3 at 8 under.\n\nWoods, Woodland and Bradley begin the third round at 7:30 p.m. ET off the first tee. The plan is to play as many holes today as possible and finish Monday morning (Sunday evening in the U.S.) Follow along for shot-by-shot analysis of Woods\u2019 round as he looks for yet another victory on Tour.\n\nZozo Championship: Leaderboard | Best photos\n\nHole 2 \u2013 Par 4\n\nTiger clubs down on this one with an iron but misses the fairway once again. He hit well off the tee in the first round, struggled a bit yesterday and is off to a slow start today. Back right pin placement here at No. 2 and this one finds the front half of the green. He\u2019ll have another lengthy putt.\n\nHole 1 \u2013 Par 4\n\nWith crowds back on the grounds today Tiger got quite the welcome from the Japanese fans on the first tee. His tee shot goes a little right, ultimately finding the rough. His first approach of the day finds the green but he\u2019s nowhere near the pin. We start the day with a lengthy birdie putt. This putt was about the entire length of the green, and TW lags it up to about five feet. Not a bad putt from distance but he left way too much to clean up for par. His second putt misses and he taps in for bogey.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 over thru 1 (11 under overall).\n\nPre-round\n\nIt\u2019s Sunday in Japan, but Tiger is leaving his classic red for Monday\u2019s final round and going with a blue shirt/black vest combination today.
