The University of Georgia graduate, a budding entrepreneur, had lined up investors for his venture, the documentary revealed.\n\nBut in January 2012, Parker was supposed to inspect some property with his business partner, Victor Blockum. Parker never made it home. His wife Kenisha Parker immediately went to local police to file a missing-person report.\n\nMANSON FAMILY MEMBERS SPEAK OUT 50 YEARS LATER IN SHOCKING DOC, RECALL MEETING CULT LEADER: \u2018I FELT ACCEPTED\u2019\n\nAuthorities checked with Blockum, who claimed he and Parker did go on their business trip. He alleged Parker later dropped him off at home and everything appeared to be fine. However, Parker's wallet and gym bag were retried from various parts of town. Then an Athens-Clarke police officer found Parker\u2019s car near the general area where his belongings were discovered.\n\nPatrick said his family had long suspected Blockum was somehow involved with the disappearance. A day after Parker went missing, Blockum allegedly attempted to withdraw $500,000 from the business bank account.\n\n\u201cI called him,\u201d Patrick recalled. \u201cWe all knew he and Charles were going to look at some land for poultry farms. And yet he said he didn\u2019t see him, he hadn\u2019t seen him since they went to check out some property. That was the last person my brother was with. I just knew in my gut Victor had something to do with it. To what extent I just didn\u2019t know\u2026 And he wasn\u2019t even around to try to find Charles, his missing business partner. Wouldn\u2019t you want to try to find out what happened? But he wasn\u2019t involved at all\u2026 I just felt in my heart that with time, we would learn the truth about Victor.\u201d\n\nIn February 2012, Parker\u2019s body was recovered from a well by some men in Oglethorpe County. The Athens Banner-Herald reported that an autopsy determined Parker was shot more than once and the condition of his body was consistent with him being in the well the entire time he was missing. Evidence collected in and around the well also led authorities to conclude he was shot at the location.\n\nDEADLY LOVE TRIANGLE INVOLVING TEXAS OILMAN, 71, AND HEIRESS, 35, EXPLORED IN SHOCKING TRUE CRIME DOC\n\nBlockum\u2019s checkered past came back to haunt him during the investigation.\n\nThe outlet revealed that in 2011, a Madison County judge sentenced him to 15 years of probation after he pleaded guilty \u201cto possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of tools for the commission of a crime.\u201d\n\nThree years earlier, in 2008, Blockum was arrested on an aggravated assault charge. While the charge was dropped after the victim recanted her story, he was still sentenced to 12 months probation on an obstruction charge.\n\nAccording to the documentary, several people associated with Blockum were fearful of coming forward to police, believing he was a master voodoo practitioner who would cast deadly spells over them. Patrick scoffed at the claims.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they were really legitimate people who really had any bearing on the outcome of the case,\u201d he explained. \"I don\u2019t think those people ever really contributed anything of substance to the case\u2026 Fearful of voodoo practices and all of that stuff was of no importance really.\u201d\n\nMARTHA MOXLEY\u2019S MOTHER, BROTHER STILL BELIEVE KENNEDY COUSIN IS GUILTY IN DOC ON UNSOLVED TEEN\u2019S DEATH\n\nIn 2018, WMAZ-TV reported Blockum confessed to killing Parker. The confession came after a jailhouse witness provided testimony saying Blockum said he killed Parker.\n\nProsecutors said Blockum pressed Parker to put him on the joint business account--a week after Parker agreed, he was dead. Just days after Parker went missing, Blockum attempted to access the account, but it was already frozen.\n\nAs part of a negotiated agreement with prosecutors, Blockum was sentenced to 20 years in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nParker\u2019s mother, Jacqueline Parker-Lawrence, told Fox News she\u2019s relieved her son\u2019s killer is finally behind bars \u2014 but there\u2019s no such thing as closure.\n\nNEW MICHELLE CARTER DOC ON HBO COMPELS CONRAD ROY\u2019S GRIEVING PARENTS TO COME FORWARD: 'IT WAS HORRIBLE'\n\n\u201cLike I told the folks in court, it could\u2019ve been 100 years, it could\u2019ve been the 20 that they gave him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to bring Charles back. It wasn\u2019t going to change the outcome of him being gone\u2026 Either way, he\u2019s locked up. So is justice really served? I don\u2019t really think so, but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\n\"Killer Motive\" airs Sundays at 7 p.m. on Oxygen.", "description": "Charles Parker had big dreams of running a thriving poultry business in Georgia when he was shot to death and then thrown down a well.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/KM1.jpg"}
