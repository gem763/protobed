The agency was responding to comments by a top mainland representative on Taiwan affairs accusing the island\u2019s leadership of using the crisis to attack Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t solve problems by talking nonsense,\u201d the council said. \u201cThe CCP should boldly face up to its mistakes, carry out political reform, put in place democracy and respect human rights. Only then can they ease China\u2019s internal and external contradictions.\u201d\n\nAlthough China and Taiwan have been governed separately for 70 years, the Communist Party maintains unification as its ultimate goal and Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this year reaffirmed \u201cone country, two systems\u201d as his preferred framework. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party supports independence, has stepped up her criticism of Beijing as the Hong Kong protests fuel new skepticism about unification.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

On Saturday, Sun Yafu, vice president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait accused Tsai of taking advantage of the unrest to undercut the idea of Hong Kong-style autonomy for the island.\n\n\u201cThe DPP instigated and supported riots in Hong Kong and then used the chaos in Hong Kong to attack \u2018one country, two systems,\u2019\u201d Sun told a gathering in Meishuan city, Sichuan, according to China Review News. \u201cInstead of picking up a gun or cannon, Tsai is actually making these weapons to attack at the mainland.\u201d\n\nTsai has angered Beijing by refusing to accept her predecessor\u2019s negotiating framework that both sides belong to \u201cone China.\u201d Still, even Taiwan\u2019s China-friendly opposition has rejected the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d approach, which was originally devised for bringing the island back under Beijing\u2019s umbrella.\n\n\u201cThe government is concerned about Hong Kong\u2019s freedom and democracy, but won\u2019t interfere in Hong Kong affairs,\u201d the Mainland Affairs Council said, adding that Taiwan \u201cwould never accept Beijing\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 and would never bow to threat of a hegemony.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Taipei-based Mainland Affairs Council said Hong Kong protests stemmed from the Communist Party\u2019s refusal to consider protesters\u2019 demands", "authors": ["Adela Lin"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/taiwan-hong-kong-protests.jpg?quality=85&crop=74px%2C172px%2C827px%2C433px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
