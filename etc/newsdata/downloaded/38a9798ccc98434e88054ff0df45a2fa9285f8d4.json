Shell and BP climbed higher by 1% each,\n\ntracking a rise in crude prices. O/R\n\nThe FTSE 250 midcap index was up by roughly the same\n\nlevel, led by a 17% jump in Intu Properties after the\n\nTimes reported that private equity firm Orion Capital Managers\n\nwas looking to buy the shopping centre operator.\n\nRises on both the bourses come ahead of a slew of British\n\neconomic data, including gross domestic product data, scheduled\n\nthis morning.\n\nInvestors are expecting central banks to step in with\n\nstimulus plans after a data showed an unexpected fall in China's\n\nexports last month, while another one pointed to a slowdown in\n\nJapan's economy in the second quarter. The weakness reflected an impact from the prolonged\n\nSino-U.S. trade war to global economic growth.\n\nThe dispute saw a sharp escalation last month when the\n\nUnited States announced tariffs going up to $200 billion worth\n\nof Chinese goods. That had dragged the FTSE 100 to its biggest\n\nmonthly fall so far this year that month.\n\nOn Monday, the FTSE 100 saw some sharp news-related falls,\n\nwith Associated British Foods losing 3.3% after poor\n\noutlook for its Primark fashion chain and British Airways owner\n\nIAG dropping 2.6% as it cancelled nearly all its\n\nflights due to strikes.\n\nSmaller airlines such as easyJet and Wizz Air\n\nwere also down 3% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nLloyds was the biggest drag with a 2% dip after\n\nBritain's largest lender said it is suspending its 2019 share\n\nbuyback programme and will make extra provisions for payment\n\nprotection insurance claims.\n\n\"Investors may also worry about the dividend, however we do\n\nknow that the later the claims, the less chance they have of\n\nsuccess,\" Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Oil majors support FTSE 100; Intu jumps on M&A report", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE020QH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
