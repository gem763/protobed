Here\u2019s what we know:\n\n\u25cfThe complaint, which was filed in mid-August, centers on Trump and his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the president\u2019s wish for an investigation of former vice president and presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\n\u25cfMaguire defended his decision not to share the complaint with Congress, saying it may have been covered by executive privilege.\n\n\u25cfMaguire threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testified, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\n[Read the whistleblower complaint]\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire defended his decision not to immediately share with Congress an extraordinary complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower alleging that President Trump used his office to solicit interference by a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. elections.\n\nMaguire told members of the House Intelligence Committee that he supported the right of the whistleblower, whose complaint helped touch an impeachment inquiry, to raise concerns with an intelligence community watchdog.\n\nBut much of the complaint concerned communications the president had with a foreign leader, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and may have been covered by executive privilege, he said. That is a privilege, Maguire said, that he is not empowered to waive.\n\nMaguire said that the White House, in the end, did not assert privilege over the complaint or the phone call it describes, which took place on July 25.\n\nMaguire said his office first sought advice from the White House Counsel and then the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel to ask if the complaint might be covered by executive privilege.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the committee chairman, strongly questioned Maguire on why he had sought advice from the White House when he president is the subject of the complaint.\n\n\u201cIt just seemed prudent to be able to check\u201d on the issue, Maguire said.\n\nMaguire said officials at the OLC determined that executive privilege might apply to the complaint, but they didn\u2019t provide an immediate decision. While officials considered the matter, Maguire said, he held off from notifying Congress.\n\nMaguire seemed at pains to emphasize that he was not authorized to decide on his own whether to provide the complaint. He called the matter extraordinary and essentially described his office as operating in uncharted waters, because the subject of the complaint is the president.\n\nAn unclassified version of the complaint was publicly released shortly before Maguire\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill.\n\nMaguire expressed to members of the House Intelligence Committee \u201cmy support for the whistleblower,\u201d who he said had followed regular procedures for raising a concern with the inspector general. He said both the whistleblower and the inspector general \u201chave acted in good faith throughout. I have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and followed the law.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general ultimately informed Congress about the existence of the complaint, but not its substance, a decision that Maguire said he supported.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Schiff called the complaint \u201cthe most graphic evidence yet that the President of the States has betrayed his oath of office. Betrayed his oath to defend our national security. And betrayed his oath to defend our constitution.\u201d\n\nSchiff said that by coming forward, the whistleblower \u201chas shown more dedication to country\u2026than the president himself.\u201d\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), derided the complaint as \u201cfake news\u201d and accused Democrats and journalists of a conspiracy to gin up baseless allegations against Trump. He called the complaint and press coverage of it an \u201cinformation warfare operation\u201d against the president.\n\n[Cracks emerge among Senate Republicans over Trump urging Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden]\n\nMaguire had threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testified, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe officials said that Maguire, who was thrust into the top intelligence post last month, warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress.\n\nMaguire denied that he had contemplated resigning. In a statement, he said that \u201cat no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration released a memorandum detailing a thirty-minute phone call that Trump had with Zelensky. It revealed that Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart to work with Attorney General William P. Barr to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and offered to meet with the foreign leader at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry.\n\nCongress\u2019s efforts to obtain the whistleblower complaint have put Maguire in the middle of a struggle between the legislative and executive branches of government.\n\nThe retired admiral, who previously ran the National Counterterrorism Center, has at times expressed his displeasure with the White House counsel and others that he felt put him in an untenable position \u2014 denying material to Congress by relying on a claim that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint didn\u2019t fall within the jurisdiction of the director of the intelligence community, according to current and former officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nMaguire has been the target of harsh criticism by congressional Democrats for not handing over the complaint, as they and some legal experts have said the law requires.\n\nOfficials said that Maguire had been pursuing an opportunity to speak to Congress and defend his actions and integrity.\n\n\u201cI want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,\u201d Maguire said in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cI am committed to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately,\u201d Maguire added. \u201cI look forward to continuing to work with the Administration and Congress to find a resolution regarding this important matter.\u201d", "description": "His appearance marks the first congressional testimony about an explosive matter that has touched off an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Ellen Nakashima", "September At Am", "Shane Harris Covers Intelligence", "National Security For The Post.
