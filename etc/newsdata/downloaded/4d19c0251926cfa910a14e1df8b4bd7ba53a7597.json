But today, the Trump administration announced it was throwing California\u2019s \u201crights\u201d under the gas-guzzling bus. Seems like as soon as federalism favors left-wing ideological positions, Republicans throw it out the window.\n\nIn the face of the Trump administration\u2019s war on climate science, California, in a pact with leading auto manufacturers, set a 54.5 miles per gallon average fuel economy standard, effective in 2025.\n\nThis is exactly the sort of coordinated, negotiated action that\u2019s necessary to fight global warming. Cars and trucks are the largest source of carbon-dioxide emissions in the United States. And we can\u2019t just leave it up to the virtuous few to drive cleaner cars; we\u2019re all in this together. California\u2019s emissions standards are a perfect example of good climate policy: achieved with industry cooperation, joined by 13 other states, and applicable to all, not just the virtuous few.\n\n\u201c In Washington, money talks, and bullshit walks\u2014and federalism is bullshit. \u201d\n\nNot only does the principle of \u201cstates rights\u201d include the right to institute rules like this, California has a specific waiver, granted as part of the 1970 Clean Air Act, to set standards more stringent than those of the federal government.\n\nSo why would a pro-federalism, pro-states-rights, let-the-states-be-the-laboratories-of-democracy administration be opposed?\n\nWell, look no further than Andrew Wheeler, the head of Trump\u2019s EPA, who for nine years was a lobbyist for the fossil fuel industry\u2014in particular, Murray Energy, the coal giant that is a significant campaign donor to Trump.\n\nNot that this is about Wheeler specifically, or Trump for that matter. This actually has nothing to do with them.\n\nThis is Republican petro-politics as the game has been played for nearly 30 years now, since Koch Industries started spreading lies about climate science back in 1991 and it became too costly to be a Republican who believed in global warming.\n\nThis is about how, in the 2017-2018 election cycle, more than 80 percent of the energy sector\u2019s $8.5 million in donations went to Republican candidates. This is why people say, perhaps too often, that \u201cthe Republican Party is the political arm of the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, money talks, and bullshit walks\u2014and federalism is bullshit.\n\nWhat happens now? Lawsuits, of course.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s activist attorney general Xavier Becerra\u2014already suing the administration over Trump\u2019s border wall and a host of other issues\u2014has promised to sue here as well.\n\nThat lawsuit will probably take at least a year to reach the Supreme Court, which means Trump\u2019s initiative may end up a lot like George W. Bush\u2019s similar move in 2007, when his oil-soaked administration also tried to stop California from implementing stricter emissions rules.\n\nBush left office before that litigation concluded and Obama\u2019s reversal rendered it moot.\n\nThe same fate could await Trump 13 months from now, particularly if Democrats make combatting climate change a mainstream issue, rather than a race to the far left.\n\nAlready, 61 percent of Americans say they are worried about climate change; 56 percent think it\u2019s an emergency; 77 percent say they favor regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant. These are impressive numbers.\n\nBut rather than seize the American consensus on climate change, most Democrats are racing leftward in ways that will surely alienate the very voters who might otherwise be persuaded to join them.\n\nFor example, Elizabeth Warren wants to spend $3 trillion to combat global warming. Not to be outdone, Bernie Sanders wants to somehow spend $16.3 trillion. I\u2019m not sure where that money comes from, but I do know that when \u201cfighting global warming\u201d means \u201cpaying much higher taxes,\u201d swing voters bolt.\n\nThis is a gigantic missed opportunity.\n\nStudy after study shows that climate change is an increasingly serious issue for swing voters, and a potential wedge issue for moderates in the five swing states that actually matter in 2020. Overwhelmingly, those moderates oppose actions like today\u2019s. They may not want a five-figure tax hike, but they do want stricter auto emissions, not weaker ones, and they don\u2019t like how corporate lobbyists, in this case from the fossil fuel industry, wield power in Washington.\n\nThat power is in sharp relief today, as Republicans abandon the principle of federalism for the profit of their oil industry donors.
