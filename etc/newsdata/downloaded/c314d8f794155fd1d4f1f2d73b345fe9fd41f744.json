So much so that he decided to casually subtweet Apple CEO Tim Cook with a bit of light tech commentary.\n\nWe can\u2019t tell if Trump recently upgraded to the iPhone XS, iPhone XR, or one of the iPhone 11 variants. But all the top-of-the-line Apple smartphones since last year have ditched the home button last seen on the iPhone 8 for the edge-to-edge design first introduced with the iPhone X in 2017.\n\nTo Tim: The Button on the IPhone was FAR better than the Swipe! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2019\n\nWe learned in March 2017 Donald Trump switched from Android to iPhone, but we didn\u2019t know which iPhone he switched to. It definitely had a home button, since the iPhone X wasn\u2019t out at that time.\n\nPerhaps Trump will be first in line for the rumored iPhone SE 2, which will reportedly look like an iPhone 8. That means it\u2019ll have the home button Trump sorely misses.", "description": "President Donald Trump seems to have recently switched to an iPhone without a home button, and he doesn\u2019t seem to like it very much.
