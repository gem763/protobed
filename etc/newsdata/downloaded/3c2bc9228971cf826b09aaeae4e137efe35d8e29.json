Rohit\u2019s sparkling 212 also included 28 boundaries.\n\nRavindra Jadeja (51) helped himself to his 13th half-century before tailender Umesh Yadav (31) smacked five sixes, all off Linde\u2019s bowling, in a 10-ball blitz before falling to the tormented left-arm spinner who returned figures of 4-133.\n\nSouth Africa were jolted immediately in their reply when Mohammed Shami dismissed Dean Elgar for a duck with his second ball and, in the next over, Yadav bounced out Quinton de Kock for four.", "description": "Rohit Sharma smashed a maiden test double century as he and centurion Ajinkya Rahane helped India reach 497 for nine before declaring on day two of the third and final test against South Africa on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442969441&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0BB", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
