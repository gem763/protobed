Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nAt the 2019 Emmys on Sunday, Goop founder and Cut fan Gwyneth Paltrow tip-tap-tip-tap-tip-tapped her way into a meme, when she walked gingerly across the stage to present the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nHer steps? Minuscule. Her torso? Immobile. Her shawl? Precariously draped, it looks like. Her smile? Beaming. The overall effect? Magical.\n\nGwyneth tip-toeing across the stage with a self-satisfied smile had the energy of a Barbie doll who just became sentient and is teetering over to let you know she remembers all the weird stuff you made her do; of someone who showed up late and unprepared to a meeting; of someone carefully gripping a jade egg inside themselves.\n\nLook at her go!\n\nthe goopery that this slow walk has pic.twitter.com/SwzNVnbLy6 \u2014 michael blackmon (@blackmon) September 23, 2019\n\nIn the intervening days, Paltrow appears to have successfully baby-stepped her way back across the stage, and on Thursday morning, she told Today\u2019s Savannah Guthrie that she doesn\u2019t get why everyone was so obsessed with her walk.\n\n\u201cI think I look pretty normal,\u201d she said, when Guthrie played her a video of the moment. \u201cI don\u2019t totally get it.\u201d\n\nShe explained that her halting gait was due to the fact that her dress was made in 1960s (before women won the right to take full steps, I think).\n\n\u201cThere was no slit in the back of the dress. It was from 1963, a couture Valentino gown,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to chop a slit in it.\u201d\n\nOr, maybe Paltrow was trying to buy time so she could try to remember the names of any of her former co-stars.\n\nStay in touch.
