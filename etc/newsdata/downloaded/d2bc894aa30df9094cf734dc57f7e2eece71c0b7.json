Winner is seen right with her mother in this undated file photo\n\nThe document she leaked was the basis of a story by the news site The Intercept, which said that it received the document anonymously.\n\nIn May, Winner\u2019s mother defended her daughter and blasted the government for portraying her as \u2018a very evil person who hates her country.\u2019\n\n'They don't want the world to be exposed to the real Reality Winner,' Billie Winner-Davis told CNN.\n\nAt her trial, prosecutors introduced evidence against Winner, including a tweet in which she referred to Trump as an \u2018orange fascist.\u2019\n\nIn another diary entry, Winner wrote: \u2018I want to burn the White House down.\u2019\n\nSo far, the government has denied attempts by the media to interview Winner from behind bars.\n\nThe sentence handed down against Winner was the longest ever imposed on an individual who provided information to journalists.\n\nWinner was tried under the Espionage Act even though prosecutors concede that she was not a spy for a foreign entity.\n\nWinner-Davis said her daughter \u2018is not a traitor.\u2019\n\nThe sentence handed down against Winner is the harshest given to anyone who leaked classified information to the press\n\n\u2018Reality served her country,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018She protected and defended us.\n\n\u2018What did she release? She released something that actually helped us to defend ourselves against an attack by Russia.\u2019\n\nWhile Winner languishes in prison, Butina is set to go home to Moscow.\n\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said on Friday it has taken custody of Butina.\n\nShe's expected to be deported to Russia now that she's finished her 18-month sentence.\n\nButina admitted that she sought to use contacts in the National Rifle Association to pursue back channels to American conservatives during the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 30-year-old pleaded guilty in December to conspiring to act as an unregistered foreign agent and was sentenced to 18 months in prison in April.\n\nShe had already served nine months in a Virginia detention center following her July 2018 arrest.\n\nButina is a pro-gun activist from Russia who infiltrated conservative political circles in the U.S. on behalf of the Kremlin around the 2016 election\n\nThe 30-year-old was convicted of conspiring to act as an unregistered foreign agent and was sentenced to 18 months in prison in April. She had already served nine months in a Virginia detention center following her July 2018 arrest\n\nOn Friday she was released from Federal Correction Institute Tallahasee, a low security prison in Florida.\n\nShe will be escorted back to Moscow by two ICE agents, her lawyer, Robert Driscoll, said to the Washington Examiner.\n\nThe details of her itinerary have not been disclosed citing security reasons.\n\n'They tend to do these things like they\u2019re moving a nuclear bomb, and they\u2019re not,' Driscoll said on the U.S. government's secrecy.\n\nDriscoll said he won\u2019t know where Butina is or if she\u2019s been released until she calls him prior to the last part of her trip home. He says she'll likely call him early Saturday morning from Europe prior boarding a flight to Moscow.\n\nWhile serving time at the Federal Correction Institute in Tallahassee, she worked 10am to 6pm shifts at the prison cafeteria. She'd go for five-mile runs every morning and with money sent from her friends she bought an MP3 player and running shoes\n\n'My thought would be that she\u2019ll fly to Atlanta, bounce to Europe somewhere, and then fly to Moscow, and get there midday Saturday,' Driscoll predicted on her plans.\n\nHe says he will be the one to notify Butina's father what flight she's on so her family, including her mother and sister, can meet her when she touches down in Moscow.\n\n'She might stay in Moscow for a night,' before traveling for their home in Barnaul, Driscoll said.\n\nHowever, the Russian Embassy in Washington, warned that the expulsion process could take 'several days'.\n\n'As we understand, Maria will be sent through a deportation center where she will spend some time awaiting departure,' the embassy shared on Facebook.\n\nButina reportedly bought an outfit off Amazon to replace her prison uniform for her big departure.\n\nDriscoll says she won't bring any bags with her to the airport as ICE only allows her to take one 40lb bag.\n\nButina was arrested in the U.S. government\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nShe was the only Russian national arrested in the Robert Mueller investigation.\n\nIn the two-year Special Counsel probe, Mueller charged 25 Russians including 12 intelligence officers and three Russian companies.\n\nWhile Butina\u2019s lawyers argued she was a gun rights activists trying to improve Russian relations with the US, she was accused of acting under the direction of Alexander Torshin, a big figure in Russian politics.\n\nWhile Butina\u2019s lawyers argued she was a gun rights activists trying to improve Russian relations with the US, but she was accused of acting under the direction of Alexander Torshin, a big figure in Russian politics (together above)\n\nFederal prosecutors argued she provided intelligence to the Kremlin.\n\nShe had originally faced up to five years in prison.\n\nDespite serving jail time, Driscoll still argues that Butina is not a spy.\n\n'If she were a Russian spy, she wouldn\u2019t have hung around for the feds to come talk to her. They talked to her boyfriend first. That gave her a warning. If she were a spy, she would have taken her stuff and dumped it. She had the opportunity to do that. She could have gotten rid of it but she didn\u2019t. Eleven FBI agents searched her apartment. They found nothing,' he said.\n\nButina was initially held at Alexandria Detention Center in Northern Virginia before she was handed down her official sentence.\n\nIn Virginia she 'didn\u2019t cause any trouble' and 'was quiet and kept to herself', a law enforcement official said to the Examiner.\n\nHer lawyer said in Virginia she 'looked like s**t' but life improved in Florida.\n\n'She was really happy about the good. She gained some weight, in a healthy way. She was happy to get fruit and vegetables every day,' Driscoll said.\n\nIn Florida she worked in the prison cafeteria where she washed dishes and served food. She\u2019d start every morning with a five-mile run around the prison track before reporting to work at 10am and would wrap up her shift at 6pm.\n\n'After work, she had some downtime when she could read, or answer mail, or have time to herself. Then she\u2019d go to bed and the next day start it all again,' Driscoll said.\n\nHe added that friends sent Butina money in jail which she used to buy an MP-3 player and running shoes.", "description": "Billie Winner-Davis (seen with daughter Reality Winner) said she was 'sick' over the news that Maria Butina (left inset), was freed from prison while her daughter (right inset) was still behind bars.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber", "Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/19/20193858-0-image-a-16_1572029709878.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
