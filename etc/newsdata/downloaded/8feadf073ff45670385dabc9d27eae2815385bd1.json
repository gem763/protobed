Now, perhaps not.", "language": "en", "text": "The sentiment is certainly not new \u2014 there have been calls for a do-over vote for years, with many pointing toward perceived \u201cBregret\u201d and the huge and to some degree unexpected disruption the process of leaving the E.U. has added to life.\n\nAD\n\nNow, however, with Johnson\u2019s deal up for a vote, the pressure appears to have resulted in a shift in momentum. Some lawmakers have suggested they might support Johnson\u2019s deal on the condition that it is put to a public vote.\n\nAD\n\nSuch a move would technically be a referendum, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a \u201csecond referendum\u201d as many had envisaged. Rather than redoing the vote from 2016, this would instead be a \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d that specifically focused on approving or rejecting Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nThe idea is far from guaranteed. Lawmakers would probably need to propose an amendment to Saturday\u2019s government motion and ensure that the amendment is approved by John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons. Only then would it be debated and voted on by members of Parliament.\n\nAD\n\nSome government officials have scoffed at the idea that a second referendum amendment could be attached.\n\n\u201cIt just won\u2019t happen. There is no way that we are having a second referendum,\u201d Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit preparations, told the BBC on Thursday, adding that Parliament would not vote for it.\n\nAD\n\nParliament has voted on a second referendum before and rejected it; the motion lost 292 to 280. It was, however, the most popular of a number of Brexit options put toward Parliament.\n\nThis time, there have been noticeable voices of support. Jenny Chapman, in charge of the Brexit portfolio for the Labour Party, told the BBC on Thursday that she thinks her party could support a second vote.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShould that opportunity come on Saturday, to have that referendum on a deal \u2026 the pragmatic, sensible thing for the Labour Party to do, given we\u2019ve been asking this, would be to take that opportunity,\u201d Chapman said.\n\nLabour\u2019s John McDonnell, shadow chancellor and a powerful figure in the party, also appeared to support the move in comments to the Evening Standard this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to stand with hundreds of thousands of people in demanding that they, not wealthy, privileged and out-of-touch hard-right Tory MPs, have the final say on what is an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s,\u201d McDonnell said, referring to the former British prime minister whose deal failed three times to pass Parliament.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, a pro-E.U. opposition party, have also pushed for a second referendum, as have some former members of the Conservative Party who broke with Johnson, such as former attorney general Dominic Grieve.\n\n\u201cThe divisions in Parliament reflect the divisions in the country,\u201d Grieve said Thursday. \u201cThis is why I think it would be sensible to go back and put this deal to the public.\u201d\n\nBercow, not often one to keep quiet, has generally held back from commenting directly about a second referendum but did say last month that he considered it a possibility.\n\n\u201cIt could happen,\u201d Bercow said at an event at the University of Zurich.\n\nFor a second-vote amendment to succeed, however, it will have to unite considerable parliamentary support behind it. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, for one, has indicated he favors voting down Johnson\u2019s plan and pushing for a new election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother option some may favor is a separate amendment proposed by Oliver Letwin that already has cross-party support. That amendment would withhold agreement for the deal until legislation to implement it is in place \u2014 effectively forcing the government to seek a delay of Britain\u2019s exit from the E.U., leaving open the possibility of a referendum at a later date.\n\nBritish lawmakers may have good reason to remain cautious. Polls do not paint a clear picture of support for a second vote in any form, and holding another referendum would carry with it considerable practical and financial costs.\n\nBut there is another data point they will have to consider: For at least a year, opinion surveys have shown a consistent preference for staying in the E.U.\n\nAD", "description": "Some lawmakers have suggested that they might support Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u2014 on the condition that it is put to a public vote.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Oic6GAFEAQNtjTwh7000OhweTmQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GVFESMHRREI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
