The gathering of bishops to discuss the Amazon is set to start Sunday. (Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA three-week meeting on the Amazon region begins Sunday at the Vatican, but even before the first debate, the gathering is turning into one of the more contentious moments in Pope Francis\u2019s papacy.\n\nThe pressures of climate change and Amazon development \u2014 highlighted by recent fires ravaging the rainforest \u2014 add an urgency to the Vatican talks that cover the church\u2019s struggles and efforts to safeguard one of the world\u2019s most critical ecosystems.\n\nBut the outreach efforts to all corners of the Catholic world \u2014 a trademark of Francis\u2019s tenure \u2014 have drawn criticism.\n\nSome conservatives say the church is straying from its roots, acting more as a nongovernmental organization than a religion. Others have zeroed in on a proposal mentioned in the event\u2019s working document: ordaining older married men to ease the severe shortage of priests in the Amazon basin.\n\nTraditionalists warn that if the proposal is adopted at the end of the meeting, it could open the door for other parts of the world to challenge the Catholic tradition of an unmarried and celibate priesthood.\n\nEven a notable Francis ally, Cardinal Marc Ouellet of Canada, expressed skepticism last week about the idea. \u201cI think I\u2019m not the only one,\u201d he added.\n\nThis is the fourth time that Francis has convened the gathering of bishops, known as a synod. Such a meeting cannot set church policies or change doctrine on its own, but it offers guidance and recommendations to the pope and serves as a barometer for views around the Catholic world and within the church.\n\n[Vatican says people can\u2019t choose their genders]\n\nCardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri, the synod\u2019s secretary general, downplayed the relevance of the working document, telling reporters Thursday that participants will \u201cstart from scratch\u201d once the event begins.\n\nStill, that initial document conveys the pope\u2019s thoughts, said Marco Politi, a veteran Vatican watcher and author of \u201cThe Loneliness of Francis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a watershed moment for his papacy,\u201d Politi said. \u201cFrancis clearly has in mind a new model of church where lay people play a greater role. Either he scores a breakthrough, or he\u2019s stopped in his tracks by conservative forces.\u201d\n\nPoliti described the conservative backlash as similar to the Republican tea party movement against President Barack Obama. \u201cThey have become increasingly aggressive, so that it almost feels normal now that a bishop, or a cardinal, should call documents that have received the pope\u2019s approval heretical,\u201d he said.\n\nIn turning its attention to the Amazon, the Vatican is responding to several forces. Francis \u2014 the first pontiff from South America \u2014 has made environmental protection a major theme of his papacy. Additionally, the Catholic Church for decades has faced an erosion as the evangelical movement spreads across Brazil and other parts of Latin America.\n\n[Pope to open World War II-era Vatican archives to scrutiny]\n\nIn a recent essay, demographer Jos\u00e9 Eust\u00e1quio Diniz Alves wrote that the number of Catholics in Brazil may drop by 50 percent within the next three years and be surpassed by evangelicals before 2032.\n\n\u201cFrancis never seeks interreligious clashes, but clearly the Brazilian bishops\u2019 majority is colliding with some evangelical groups,\u201d said Politi, who believes this to be \u201cthe most political synod of Francis\u2019 papacy.\u201d\n\nPoliti added that the event runs in opposition to the policies of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who came to power pledging to end or loosen environmental protections for the sake of economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe pope believes natural and social decay are connected, so this synod acquires the very strong geopolitical meaning of a rift with other strong international leaders,\u201d Politi said.\n\nAs if to show its dedication to the environment, the Vatican has recently made some small but symbolic changes.\n\nIn the Holy See press room, cups at the water cooler were recently changed from plastic to paper. The 185 participants coming to Rome from the Amazon and other parts of the world were only registered online, \u201cto prevent paper waste,\u201d Baldisseri said.\n\nThe Vatican considers the Amazon region to spread across nine countries. The biggest of those is Brazil, where some high-profile evangelical figures and others have voiced discomfort with the event.\n\nEvangelical leader Estevam Hernandes, president of the March for Jesus \u2014 an event that has drawn Bolsonaro\u2019s participation \u2014 said that the discussion will not help the region.\n\n\u201cWe understand environmental concern, but it cannot hurt the sovereignty of our country,\u201d he told The Washington Post.\n\nChurch traditionalists have tried to raise concerns of their own, holding events in Rome designed as counterprogramming to the synod.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a triple attack on marriage, celibacy and priesthood,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ureta of the Plinio Correa de Oliveira Institute of Sao Paulo. If the requirement for priestly celibacy is loosened in the Amazon, he said, similar changes in \u201cthe rest of the church would be a matter of time.\u201d\n\nMarina Lopes in Sao Paulo, Brazil, contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nVatican seeks to indict 2 priests in abuse case within its walls\n\nAt church abuse summit, Francis calls for \u2018all-out battle\u2019\n\nWikiLeaks takes a swipe at the famously secretive Vatican\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The three-week meeting of bishops beginning Sunday is another point of friction between Pope Francis and his conservative critics.", "authors": ["Stefano Pitrelli", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zqAl_y5MGzs8y28U7tFyR7gJW80=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JJMAYLHHQQI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
