He is due to step down tomorrow\n\nBoris Johnson led the tributes to Mr Bercow but he could not resist a final dig at the Commons Speaker who has been a thorn in the side of the government on Brexit\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn began his questions at PMQs by paying tribute to Mr Bercow.\n\nMr Corbyn said: 'I want to thank you Mr Speaker for the way that you've used your speakership in the decade-long tenure you've had.\n\n'You've done so much to reform this House of Commons and our democracy is the stronger for the way that you've done it.'\n\nHe also joked: 'You've served for ten years, you've given real power to backbenchers, vastly expanded the use of urgent questions which has been overwhelmingly popular with all government ministers.\n\n'And opened up the number of emergency debates, which is even more popular with even more government ministers.'\n\nFather of the House and former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke also praised Mr Bercow.\n\nHe said: 'During your decade, there have been unprecedented attempts really to try to, at times, increase the power of the Executive at the expense of this Parliament.\n\n'You have been very formidable in maintaining the duty of government to be accountable to this House.\n\n'I trust your successor will try to live up to your very considerable achievement.'\n\nMr Bercow said Mr Clarke is 'one of the most popular and respected politicians in our country'.\n\nJeremy Corbyn told Mr Bercow: 'You've done so much to reform this House of Commons'\n\nThe Speaker's voice cracked with emotion as he paid tribute to former staff and his family.\n\nHe said his family have displayed 'support, stoicism and fortitude through thick and thin' during the last decade.\n\nMr Bercow said he would 'never forget it and I'll always be grateful for it' as MPs applauded.\n\nIn September Mr Bercow announced his intention to step down on October 31.\n\nThere had been speculation that he could stay on as Commons Speaker after the UK's departure from the EU was delayed.\n\nBut he is due to walk away from the role tomorrow with the election of his successor scheduled to take place on Monday next week before Parliament is dissolved for the December 12 general election.", "description": "Speaker John Bercow welled up in the House of Commons today as MPs paid tribute to him at his last PMQs after a decade in the chair.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline", "Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/13/20376644-0-image-a-23_1572442011347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
