Specifically my birthday party?\n\nA tech company in Seattle is touting a new robotic pizza-making machine that, they say, can assemble up to 300 12-inch pizzas per hour.\n\nPIZZA HUT TESTING SYSTEM WHERE CUSTOMERS NEVER HAVE TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE\n\nPicnic, the company behind the pizza-spewing apparatus, has reportedly been working on its modular food assembly line for three years, according to GeekWire. And last week, Picnic finally unveiled a pizza-making prototype to the media.\n\nThe apparatus, which so far has no catchy, trademarkable name, is made out of a series of modules that apply sauce, cheese and toppings as the dough moves along a conveyor underneath each piece of equipment.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nRight now the robot makes pizza; Picnic is hoping to expand those abilities to include any number of other dishes.\n\n\u201cOur modular system is the first of its kind,\u201d reads a message on Picnic\u2019s website. \u201cIt can perform any number of food assembly tasks in any order, completely configurable to any restaurant's process. Starting with pizza, our system will soon be able to make a wide variety of foods including sandwiches, salads, bowls, and more.\u201d\n\nThe key words in that statement are \u201cfood assembly tasks\u201d \u2014 the robotic machines still depend on a human to make each individual component (dough, sauce, cheese, toppings) and to place the pizza on the conveyor, GeekWire notes. Once the pies come out the other end, they still need to be baked, too.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThat said, the process can be programmed to be completely automated. Ideally, when an order is placed, the machine will be able to store that information \u2014 along with any subsequent orders \u2014 and perform the tasks in sequential order as soon as its sensors detect dough on the conveyor.\n\nFuture restaurateurs will be able to lease the apparatus for their own use \u2014 Picnic doesn\u2019t sell the modules outright \u2014 with Picnic periodically servicing and updating the machines.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nThe current design is also just a prototype that Picnic is testing at a few locations, including a restaurant in Redmond, Wash., called Zaucer, and at T-Mobile Park, where Centerplate, one of the stadium\u2019s vendors, has been beta-testing the machine.\n\nThe ultimate test, however, is taste. Are robotically-assembled pizzas distinguishable from hand-assembled pies?\n\n\u201cFor the customers, they couldn\u2019t tell a difference, which for me was a win,\u201d Centerplate\u2019s general manager Steve Dominguez told the Seattle Times.", "description": "But is it available to rent for birthday parties?", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/PIzzaPicnic.jpg"}
