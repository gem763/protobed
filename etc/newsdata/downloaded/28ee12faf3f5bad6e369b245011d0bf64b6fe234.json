Ha.\n\nPer Mumbrella, Ad Standards said it had received over 600 complaints about the ad about people bleeding. Again, ha.\n\nHere\u2019s the longer version of the ad.\n\nWell I think Libra did a fab job.\n\nBut people were very upset to see menstrual blood during peak television viewing hours. Oh no! People were also very concerned about their kids and sons seeing the ad. Oh no! Quelle horreur!\n\nComplaints included the words \u201cappalled\u201d, \u201coffensive\u201d, \u201cdegrading\u201d, \u201cconfronting\u201d, and \u201cexplicit\u201d.\n\nFucking hell.\n\nYou know what\u2019s offensive? Waking up in the morning with a spot of blood on your sheets after you just changed them, because you forgot to stock up on overnight pads. The worst.\n\nAd Standards ended up dismissing a bulk of the complaints. One read: \u201cBodily secretions shouldn\u2019t be shown on TV ads. I wouldn\u2019t expect a toilet paper advertisement to show faeces on toilet paper, or an advertisement showing nasal secretions for tissues.\u201d Neither are stigmatised, one even has its own emoji but go off mate.\n\nAnother somehow linked an ad normalising periods to attracting pedophiles. Ad Standards just straight up shot down this complaint. Also, all the women in the ad are over 18.\n\nFor the record, the ad did receive a \u2018P\u2019 rating which means it\u2019s allowed to be on telly at all times except during children\u2019s and preschool programs.\n\nIn their response, Libra cited statistics that found 3 in 4 Aussie woman believe there is a stigma surrounding periods. Hence the ad.\n\nLibra said the ad is \u201cencouraging women, men, boys and girls (with guidance from their parents) to imagine a world where women and girls don\u2019t have to hide anymore, where there is no shame attached to changing your pad in a toilet, asking for a pad at a dinner party or carrying your pad without hiding it.\u201d\n\nTo conclude: Ad Standards said the ad did not breach the Code of Ethics and chucked the complaints in the bin.", "description": "In hardly surprisingly news, a new #BloodNormal ad from Libra has copped a barrage of complaints, crowning it this year's most complained-about ad.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-18-at-12.53.53-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
