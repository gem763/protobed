Again lack of diversity means lack of understanding and empathy. The punishment is a joke.\u2019\n\nThe Group A clash against England was played in a partially-closed Vasil Levski Stadium, due to a two-game punishment they were previously handed for racist behaviour.\n\nThe second of those games, against Czech Republic on November 17 will now be played in an empty ground following Bulgaria\u2019s third offence this year.\n\nAfter the abuse of Raheem Sterling and Co, UEFA's punishment was met with fury and dismay\n\nAnti-discrimination Fare added: \u2018We are disappointed that Bulgaria will not be expelled from the Euro 2020 qualifying competition given their previous record and obvious inability to deal with the problems they face.\u2019 \u201cThe evidence and circumstances of this match would have justified European football being given a stronger signal on the need to tackle racism.\u2019\n\nAn FA spokesperson described the behaviour of Bulgaria\u2019s fans as \u2018disgraceful\u2019 and \u2018deplorable\u2019 but were keen to stress the need for education programmes to help solve a problem that is the scourge of the game.\n\n\u2018That has to be the way forward to help address the root cause of such disgusting behaviour,\u2019 the spokesperson added.\n\nBulgaria were also ordered to display a \u2018NO TO RACISM\u2019 banner with the UEFA logo and fined \u00a38,633 for whistling during England\u2019s national anthem.\n\nThe FA were also fined \u00a34,317 for doing the same during the Bulgarian anthem.", "description": "UEFA on Tuesday faced calls from Kick It Out to overhaul their disciplinary process after handing Bulgaria a punishment that included playing just one guaranteed game behind closed doors.", "authors": ["Adrian Kajumba For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20344968-0-image-a-13_1572381107313.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
