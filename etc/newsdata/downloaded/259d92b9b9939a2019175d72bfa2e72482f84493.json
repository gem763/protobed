Before Dyck can recite his stump speech, the driver cuts him off.\n\n\u201cHey man, you\u2019ve got my vote,\u201d says Matthew Bailey, rolling down the window of his minivan.\n\nUntil recently, such a scene \u2013 a Green party candidate making inroads in the country\u2019s most populous province \u2013 would have been inconceivable.\n\nFor many years, the Greens were dismissed as a fringe outfit, with just one federal MP \u2013 the party\u2019s leader Elizabeth May, who has sat in parliament since 2011.\n\nBut growing fears over the impact of the climate crisis and dissatisfaction with establishment parties have left many voters weary of politics-as-usual.\n\nThe Liberal government\u2019s efforts to claim the environmental high ground has been undercut by its decision to buy a controversial oil pipeline to make sure construction is completed \u2013 despite opposition by Indigenous communities and scientists.\n\nAnd Justin Trudeau\u2019s own brand has been tarnished \u2013 first by a conflict-of-interests scandal and then by the emergence of three images of him in blackface.\n\nIn contrast, the Greens have experienced a pre-election surge in popularity: for the first time in Canadian history, they have become the official opposition in one province (Prince Edward Island). And in late spring, the Greens won a federal by-election, stealing the seat from the leftwing New Democratic party and doubling their seats in parliament.\n\nThat still leaves the party well short of the 12 seats required for official party status in parliament, and popular support for the Greens averages at around 9%. But against all odds, May has reason to feel buoyant.\n\nShe consistently polled as the most trusted federal party leader, Green membership has never been higher and the party is breaking fundraising records. And polls suggest that her party is set to gain more seats in this election.\n\n\u201cThe public support feels very different. It\u2019s palpable. It\u2019s tangible,\u201d May told the Guardian.\n\nAfter years of effort, her party\u2019s focus on a mounting environmental crisis has resonated with voters across the political spectrum.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Green party leader Elizabeth May: \u2018The public support feels very different. It\u2019s palpable. It\u2019s tangible.\u2019 Photograph: Carlos Osorio/Reuters\n\n\u201cConservatives are not immune to concerns about their grandchildren,\u201d she said.\n\nAcross the country, polling suggests the Greens have a legitimate shot of doubling or tripling their presence in parliament, running competitive races in British Columbia, Atlantic Canada and Ontario.\n\nAnd in Guelph, a college town of nearly 150,000 hemmed in by farmland, May believes the Dyck is \u201cvery, very likely\u201d to emerge victorious on election day.\n\nBut the Greens are also focused on using the election as a way of shedding their image of a single-issue issue party, instead recruiting candidates from a broad range of ideological perspectives: ardent environmentalists, libertarian-leaning thinkers and fiscal conservatives.\n\n\u201cWe were the first party to call for equal marriage. We were the first party to call for legalization of cannabis. We were the first party to call for getting rid of \u2018first-pass-the post\u2019 voting. There\u2019s a long list,\u201d said May.\n\nIn some ways, Dyck represents the archetype of a \u201cgreen\u201d candidate running for public office: he drives an electric car, drinks a roasted barley beverage and wears a sturdy pair of hiking shoes while canvassing the city\u2019s south end.\n\nJustin Trudeau: the rise and fall of a political brand Read more\n\nBut he also comes from a farming town in Alberta, where his family works in the oil and gas industry. And when speaking with potential voters, he lights up about capital gains tax and zero-interest loans \u2013 two policies in the recently released party platform.\n\nThe manifesto includes the standard fare of Green promises: reducing the country\u2019s emissions, electrifying cars and bolstering environmental protections.\n\nBut it also calls for Canada to resettle climate refugees, rely more heavily on domestic Canadian oil production instead of imports, decriminalize all drugs and promise free post-secondary education.\n\nOn the doorsteps and sidewalks of Guelph, it\u2019s clear that not everyone is a Green voter in waiting. Some locals tell Dyck they\u2019re not interested in politics; others listen politely, but tell him they\u2019re skeptical of the party\u2019s chances across the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard to ask Canadians to vote for someone who\u2019s probably not going win,\u201d said Lori Turnbull, a professor of political science at Dalhousie University. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what the Greens are asking.\u201d\n\nBut even a small number of seats would matter: recent polling show both the Liberals and the opposition Conservatives falling short of a majority.\n\nThe Greens have the potential to hold the balance of power in a minority government\u2013 and a chance to bring Green policy proposals to the negotiating table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in a balance of power in order to have power for the Green party,\u201d said May. \u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in, is the balance of responsibility \u2026 We will not support any government that has not put together a persuasive \u2013 and convincing \u2013 plan for real climate action.\u201d\n\nWith increased attention, however, comes increased scrutiny. The party recently ejected a candidate for an Islamophobic social media post and another candidate sowed confusion over whether or not he is a Quebec separatist.\n\nEven May prompted a flurry of questions after she told reporters wouldn\u2019t whip party votes to block a Green candidate from tabling anti-abortion legislation \u2013 although she insists that she is firmly in favour of a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never made any statements about the abortion issue at any time in my life \u2013never retreating one inch \u2013 from a woman\u2019s rights to legal abortion. Ever,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the increased scrutiny the party reflects the belief \u2013 among voters and analysts \u2013that the Greens may end up playing an outsized role in October, said Turnbull.\n\n\u201cThere is a scenario in which May could be a kingmaker. And people really want to know \u2013 apart from the environment \u2013 what do the Greens want to do?\u201d she said. \u201cThere are scenarios in which even though she\u2019s probably going to have the fewest seats, she could still be at the table.\u201d", "description": "Party\u2019s focus on environmental crisis has resonated with voters across the political spectrum ahead of federal election", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682129f3148ef62bc41e316d2ad5b2e2f4a18ad5/413_652_7533_4519/master/7533.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98311ede0815d9d1d1aeabbf5e4aa15b", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
