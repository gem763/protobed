It was very distressing trying to explain everything.\u2019\n\nMeleri, fom Hendy, Carmarthenshire, tried to book with Argentina\u2019s largest airline again on the trip home \u2013 but was met with the same response.\n\nShe said: \u2018We tried booking another flight and thought maybe if we gave them a warning it would be okay, but once again, they said it would be impossible.\u2019\n\nMeleri claims she is yet to receive any response from the airline to her complaint.\n\nThe airline based in Buenos Aires has so far not responded to a request for a comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
