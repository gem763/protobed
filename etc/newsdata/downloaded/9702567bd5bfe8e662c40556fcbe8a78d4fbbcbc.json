(Visar Kryeziu/AP)\n\nWhen then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son joined the board of an obscure Ukrainian gas company half a decade ago, it was a stunning coup for its owner, a former Ukrainian minister working to remake the company\u2019s image as he faced a money-laundering investigation.\n\nFor Hunter Biden, the job came with risks: Ukraine was in the throes of political upheaval, and there was building scrutiny of former government officials profiting in the lucrative gas industry. His father was the face of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to get Ukraine to crack down on corruption.\n\nThe region was so unsettled that one of Hunter Biden\u2019s investment firm partners at the time \u2014 former secretary of state John F. Kerry\u2019s stepson \u2014 believed that joining the board of Burisma Holdings was a bad idea and ended his business relationship with Biden and another partner, his spokesman told The Washington Post.\n\nNow, more than five years later, with Joe Biden running for president, Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to get involved with the Ukrainian firm is the backdrop of an extraordinary whistleblower complaint against President Trump that is reshaping the 2020 political landscape.\n\n[Staring down impeachment, Trump sees himself as a victim of historic proportions]\n\nRevelations that Trump, along with his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, pressed the Ukrainians to pursue investigations into Burisma and examine the role of the Bidens have triggered an impeachment inquiry in the House, with allegations that Trump withheld U.S. support for Ukraine to ensure Kiev investigated his potential rival in the presidential election.\n\nNo evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the Bidens has surfaced. Giuliani\u2019s primary allegation \u2014 that Joe Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor to quash a probe into the former minister and Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky \u2014 is not substantiated and has been widely disputed by former U.S. officials and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists.\n\nStill, Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to associate himself with the company has raised an uncomfortable question the Biden campaign is struggling to explain: Why didn\u2019t the vice president take steps to head off a perceived conflict of interest between his efforts to crack down on corruption in Ukraine and his son\u2019s work for a gas tycoon investigated for abusing his position as a government official?\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Joe Biden tell Hunter, \u2018Come off it. What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019 \u201d said Oliver Bullough, a British journalist on the advisory board of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, or AntAC, a nonprofit in Ukraine.\n\nFor some Ukrainians, Hunter Biden\u2019s association with Burisma undermined his father\u2019s calls to end corruption in Ukraine. It also raised concerns that prosecutors would avoid pursuing alleged wrongdoing by Zlochevsky out of fear that the former minister had high-level connections in the United States \u2014 the critical backer of the Ukrainian government at the time.\n\n\n\nUkrainian businessman and founder of the Burisma Holdings company, Mykola Zlochevsky, during a media conference in February 2012. (Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/Sipa USA/AP)\n\nInside the vice president\u2019s office, there was discussion about whether Hunter\u2019s position on the board would be perceived as a conflict of interest, according to several former aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nOne former adviser was concerned enough to mention it to the vice president, according to an adviser, but the conversation was brief, and other aides said they didn\u2019t want \u2014 or see a need \u2014 to raise the issue.\n\nFormer U.S. officials who worked with Biden maintain that his son\u2019s activities in no way influenced his actions regarding Ukraine as vice president.\n\n\u201cIs there an appearance issue?\u201d a former adviser said. \u201cOf course there\u2019s an appearance issue. But did it actually create wrongdoing? No.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the White House said that Hunter Biden was a private citizen and that the vice president didn\u2019t endorse any company in Ukraine. While vice president, Joe Biden did not comment publicly on his son\u2019s role at Burisma.\n\nWhat specific duties Hunter Biden carried out for Burisma are not fully known. A lawyer for Hunter Biden, George R. Mesires, declined to say how much his client earned, or whether the vice president\u2019s son knew the company\u2019s owner was in the crosshairs of authorities when he joined.\n\nQuestions about Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine \u201cdistract focus from the President\u2019s and Mr. Giuliani\u2019s own wrongdoing by re-asking questions that have been answered to the full satisfaction of everyone who initially scrutinized Hunter\u2019s conduct,\u201d Mesires said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSimply, there have been no, and could not have been any, findings of wrong-doing by Hunter. Period,\u201d Mesires added.\n\nThe Biden campaign declined to say why Joe Biden didn\u2019t ask his son to leave Burisma\u2019s board to avoid any perceived conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden proudly fought for reform in Ukraine and his achievement of a goal the U.S., EU, IMF, and entire Ukrainian anti-corruption community all strongly supported was a profound victory for good government there,\u201d Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Obama-Biden Administration created and upheld the strongest ethics policy of any presidency in American history, and the desperate smear campaign that Donald Trump was just caught trying to ensnare Ukraine into has been comprehensively discredited,\u201d Bates added.\n\nChanging political tide\n\n\n\nAnti-government protesters guard the perimeter of Independence Square in Kiev on Feb. 19, 2014. (Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images)\n\nHunter Biden became involved in Ukraine at a chaotic political moment for the former Soviet republic. In early 2014, an uprising on Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, known as the maidan, ousted the Russia-leaning government of President Viktor Yanukovych and swept into power a group of Ukrainian politicians seeking closer relations with Europe and the United States.\n\nYanukovych and members of his inner circle \u2014 sometimes called the Family \u2014 left for Russia, fearing prosecution by the new authorities in Kiev. International notices went out asking foreign nations to freeze the assets of Yanukovych\u2019s closest allies. His tax minister and prosecutor general were in such a frenzy to leave Ukraine that they knocked over an airport metal detector as they fled.\n\nThe upheaval posed a problem for Zlochevsky. A longtime player in Russia-leaning political circles, he was neither one of Yanukovych\u2019s closest allies nor one of the pro-Western politicians taking power in Kiev.\n\nOn two occasions, Zlochevsky had served in top Ukrainian government positions in the country\u2019s energy sector \u2014 once during the tenure of former president Leonid Kuchma and again during the Yanukovych years as ecology minister. During his tenure in those offices, oil and gas companies that would later become part of Burisma secured a windfall of critical licenses, according to Ukrainian license records for the firm\u2019s subsidiaries, Esco-Pivnich and Pari.\n\nEventually, Zlochevsky built what would ultimately become Ukraine\u2019s largest gas producer and transformed himself into one of the country\u2019s richest men.\n\nBurisma has said all its permits were issued lawfully. The company told the Wall Street Journal in 2015 that Zlochevsky followed \u201cthe letter and spirit of the law in his role as a civil servant. He has, at all times, held himself to the highest moral and ethical standards of fairness and decision making.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting in the Kremlin on Dec. 17, 2013. (Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBy 2014, Zlochevsky had been swept to the outer limits of Yanukovych\u2019s circle, downgraded from minister to a deputy secretary.\n\nThat March, a few weeks after Yanukovych fled to Russia and amid a zeal in Kiev to go after former officials suspected of graft, authorities in the U.K. opened a money-laundering probe into Zlochevsky and froze millions of dollars in his companies\u2019 British accounts, according to British court documents. The action followed a suspicious activity report by the bank BNP Paribas.\n\nAccording to the court documents, among the assets in the accounts was $20 million provided by a company owned by Sergey Kurchenko, a tycoon close to Yanukovych who had been sanctioned by the European Union weeks earlier. Zlochevsky\u2019s representatives said the money was transferred for a legitimate sale.\n\nThe freeze was the beginning of years of legal troubles for Zlochevsky, which would later extend to criminal probes into his activities by Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general and anti-corruption bureau. In the U.K., he was never charged with any crimes, and the freeze on his assets was eventually lifted.\n\nNeither Zlochevsky nor Burisma responded to repeated requests for comment for this story.\n\nIn 2017, Burisma announced that all legal proceedings against the company and Zlochevsky had been closed. That February, John Buretta, an American attorney for the company, said that Zlochevsky fully cooperated with all the inquiries and that Ukrainian prosecutors presented \u201cno evidence\u201d to support any claim that he had abused his position.\n\nHowever, Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau said Friday that it was still probing licenses granted to Burisma during the years Zlochevsky was ecology minister, which predate Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with the firm.\n\nA Western makeover\n\n\n\nVice President Joe Biden walks past the barricades on Mykhailivska Square in Kiev on April 22, 2014. (Sergei Chuzavkov/AP)\n\nHunter Biden joined Burisma less than two months after U.K. authorities opened the money-laundering investigation. It is unclear whether the vice president\u2019s son knew at the time about the probe in Britain. At the time, Zlochevsky\u2019s ownership of the company was not widely known.\n\nBringing aboard a son of the U.S. vice president was part of a broad effort by Burisma to burnish its credentials that had started before the 2014 uprising. The company tapped Alan Apter, an investment banker who has worked in the United States and Europe, as its board chairman, and the former president of Poland as a board member. Burisma had brought in a new executive team and hired established international firms to audit its reserves and financial results.\n\nThe addition of prominent Americans and Europeans to the company\u2019s board in the weeks after Kiev\u2019s dramatic change in government sent a message internally in Ukraine that Zlochevsky had access to powerful people in the West, according to Bullough, who wrote about Zlochevsky in \u201cMoneyland,\u201d his book on tax havens and shell companies.\n\n\u201cAdding these people with these fancy names to the board made Burisma, [which] got licenses to extract gas in Ukraine through very suspicious means, look like a Western, legitimate company,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center. She described such \u201cwhitewashing\u201d as a common tactic for tycoons and officials who are looking to legitimize assets of questionable origin.\n\nApter, who remains the board chairman, did not respond to requests for comment. Burisma has said its licenses were obtained lawfully.\n\nBurisma also began emphasizing that its gas production would reduce Ukraine\u2019s reliance on Russian energy, an argument that appealed to Washington, where the company began donating to the think tank the Atlantic Council.\n\nA month before Hunter Biden joined Burisma\u2019s board, his father traveled to Ukraine as vice president and announced an aid package designed to enable Ukraine to boost its energy production.\n\n\u201cImagine where you\u2019d be today if you were able to tell Russia: \u2018Keep your gas,\u2019 \u201d Biden said. \u201cIt would be a very different world.\u201d\n\n[As vice president, Biden said Ukraine should increase gas production. Then his son got a job with a Ukrainian gas company.]\n\nEven as he overhauled Burisma, Zlochevsky remained in the crosshairs of authorities in Ukraine. By 2015, prosecutors had opened two probes into the former ecology minister \u2014 one into claims of unlawful enrichment and the other into alleged abuse of power, forgery and embezzlement, according to documents from the prosecutor general\u2019s office reviewed by the Wall Street Journal at the time. Zlochevsky denied wrongdoing in those cases.\n\nFathers and sons\n\n\n\nVice President Joe Biden arrives on Air Force Two in Beijing in December 2013 with his son Hunter Biden, right, and his granddaughter Finnegan Biden. (Ng Han Guan/AP)\n\nFor years, Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings \u2014 including a stint as a K Street lobbyist while his father was a U.S. senator \u2014 have been difficult topics for staffers to discuss with the former vice president, according to those who have worked with him.\n\nTheir family has been tested by tragedy. Hunter Biden survived a 1972 car accident that killed his mother and sister. His brother Beau, who also survived, died of cancer in 2015. And Hunter Biden has struggled with addiction and financial difficulties in recent years, according to filings from his 2017 divorce.\n\nDuring Ukraine\u2019s political upheaval in 2014, the Yale Law graduate was the unpaid chairman of the board of World Food Program USA, a partner in an investment firm called Rosemont Seneca and a counsel for the New York law firm Boies Schiller Flexner.\n\nOne of his investment company partners, Devon Archer, had just joined the board of Burisma. Soon, Hunter Biden received his own invitation.\n\nBut another partner in their investment firm raised serious concerns.\n\nChris Heinz, Kerry\u2019s stepson, told Archer that joining Burisma was a bad idea, according to a spokesman for Heinz. Heinz was concerned about reports of corruption in Ukraine, geopolitical risks and general questions about appearance.\n\n\u201cMr. Heinz strongly warned Mr. Archer that working with Burisma was unacceptable. Mr. Archer stated that he and Hunter Biden intended to pursue the opportunity as individuals, not as part of the firm,\u201d Heinz spokesman Chris Bastardi told The Post.\n\nThe decision fractured the firm.\n\n\u201cThe lack of judgment in this matter was a major catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his business relationships with Mr. Archer and Mr. Biden,\u201d Bastardi said, adding that Heinz and his investment firm were never involved with Burisma.\n\nArcher could not be reached for comment. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nChris Heinz introduces his mother at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in July 2004. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMesires, Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, did not respond to a question about whether Hunter Biden knew of Heinz\u2019s warning.\n\nHunter Biden told The Post earlier this year that he joined the company at the urging of another board member, the former president of Poland, Aleksander Kwasniewski. In a statement, Biden said they shared a belief that Ukrainian energy independence was critical to rebuffing Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHunter Biden brought knowledge of international politics to the board, which met twice a year, the former Polish president said in an interview, recalling how he told the vice president\u2019s son, \u201cI am sure this company is very important for the independence of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nApter, the investment banker who chairs the board, said at the time that the selection of the vice president\u2019s son \u201cwas totally based on merit.\u201d\n\nBiden campaign officials said Joe Biden learned of Hunter\u2019s appointment to Burisma\u2019s board of directors only from media reports.\n\nIn a statement to The Post earlier this year, Hunter Biden said, \u201cAt no time have I discussed with my father the company\u2019s business or my board service.\u201d Joe Biden echoed the sentiment recently, speaking in Iowa. He said, \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden told the New Yorker that his father alluded to his Burisma job just once.\n\n\u201cDad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do,\u2019 \u201d Hunter recounted.\n\nWhen he joined, Burisma officials said Biden would oversee its legal affairs. But he did not end up in that role. He said in a statement to The Post that he joined the board \u201cto help reform Burisma\u2019s practices of transparency, corporate governance and responsibility\u201d but did not provide examples of his work.\n\nHunter\u2019s decision entangled him in a country that Transparency International had ranked among the world\u2019s most corrupt, a place where business executives have co-opted prosecutors and manipulated the courts to enhance their financial interests.\n\nA fired prosecutor\n\n\n\nUkrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin holds a news conference in Kiev in November 2015. (Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBy 2015, frustration was mounting in Kiev over the slow efforts by the Western-leaning president, Petro Poroshenko, to stamp out corruption.\n\nJournalists in Ukraine were documenting the enormous wealth enjoyed by former government officials such as Zlochevsky, at one point flying drones to film two side-by-side mansions outside Kiev registered to his family and associates. His daughter promoted a new luxury store in Kiev named Zlocci \u2014 a play on his surname \u2014 that was offering crocodile, alligator and ostrich shoes as Ukrainians faced a biting recession.\n\nMuch of the ire about corruption focused on Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who U.S. and European officials believed was not sufficiently aggressive.\n\nIn a September 2015 speech, Geoffrey Pyatt, then the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, publicly criticized Shokin\u2019s office, known as the PGO, for failing to go after high-level corruption cases.\n\n\u201cWe have learned that there have been times that the PGO not only did not support investigations into corruption, but rather undermined prosecutors working on legitimate corruption cases,\u201d he said.\n\nIn particular, Pyatt singled out the office for its failure to provide sufficient information to British authorities to justify their freeze of Zlochevsky\u2019s funds, one reason the U.K. court ultimately released them.\n\nInstead, the Ukrainians \u201csent letters to Zlochevsky\u2019s attorneys attesting that there was no case against him,\u201d Pyatt said.\n\nPyatt called for officials who wrote the letters to be investigated and for those responsible for \u201csubverting the case\u201d against Zlochevsky to be fired.\n\nSuch criticisms were part of a broader consensus among U.S. and European officials that progress on the anti-corruption agenda had stalled under Shokin. Western aid was largely contingent on such reform.\n\n\n\nVice President Joe Biden addresses the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev on Dec. 8, 2015. (Sergei Chuzavkov/AP)\n\nU.S. officials selected Biden \u2014 the primary messenger for the administration\u2019s Ukraine policy at the time \u2014 to underscore the discontent.\n\nDuring a 2015 speech before the Ukrainian parliament, Biden called for the country to root out corruption and said, \u201cThe Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform.\u201d\n\nBiden later recounted telling Poroshenko more bluntly that the United States would withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee if action was not taken against Shokin.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said: \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u2019 \u201d Biden said during a 2018 speech before the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWell, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nShokin \u2014 who has provided information about Biden to Giuliani \u2014 told The Post earlier this year that he believes he was ousted in March 2016 because he was investigating Burisma. If he had been allowed to remain in the job, he would have questioned Hunter Biden\u2019s qualifications to be a board member, he said, noting that \u201cthis person had no work experience in Ukraine or in the energy sector.\u201d\n\n[In gambit for Trump, Giuliani engaged parade of Ukrainian prosecutors]\n\nBut at the time, the Zlochevsky case was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nKaleniuk recalled how she and other anti-corruption activists in Ukraine criticized Shokin heavily for not pursuing the investigation and hoped his dismissal would re-energize the case.\n\nBullough said that the central allegation Giuliani has made against Biden, \u201cthis idea that he had Shokin sacked to protect Zlochevsky and Burisma, is just nonsense.\u201d Under Shokin, he noted, the prosecutor\u2019s office endured a scandal in which top officials were allegedly caught with stashes of diamonds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.\n\n\u201cBut the separate truth is: Should Joe Biden have prevented his son from essentially trading off the Biden name?\u201d Bullough asked. \u201cMaybe he should have.\u201d\n\nShokin\u2019s successor, Yuri Lutsenko, whose comments at one point helped boost Giuliani\u2019s efforts to raise questions about the Biden investigation, said in an interview with The Post that he believed Hunter Biden didn\u2019t run afoul of any laws in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,\u201d Lutsenko said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until this May, just after Joe Biden launched his presidential bid, that Hunter Biden decided not to serve another term on Burisma\u2019s board.\n\n\u201cI would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them,\u201d Hunter Biden told the New Yorker for a lengthy story in July that detailed his personal difficulties and history of substance abuse.\n\nHunter said in the story that he had apologized to his father for the turmoil he has placed upon him.\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry,\u2019 and we have an ongoing debate about who should be more sorry,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cAnd we both realize that the only true antidote to any of this is winning. He says, \u2018Look, it\u2019s going to go away.\u2019 There is truly a higher purpose here, and this will go away.\u201d\n\nMichael Birnbaum and David L.
