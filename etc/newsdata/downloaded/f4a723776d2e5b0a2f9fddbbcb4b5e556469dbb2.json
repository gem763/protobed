Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nLike many city guys with office jobs, I have the kind of stubble that\u2019s not quite a beard \u2014 but always verging on it. This was true when I first reviewed beard trimmers last year and it remains so today, my scruff often hovering around one millimeter in length. In our post-Mumford & Sons era, mine is a common facial-hair choice, probably because it takes almost no effort. All it requires is an electric beard trimmer, decent eyesight, and a willingness to never actually shave your face (unless you want to clean up your neck with a proper razor occasionally, which is considered respectable before meetings and big events).\n\nThat said, finding the right trimmer to execute this not-really-shaving look is a challenge. You want one that will last for years while still holding its charge, preferably with a lithium-ion battery. The blades should be sharp \u2014 for morning efficiency, mostly \u2014 and the tool should feel good in your hands without seeming cheap, or getting too easily clogged with hairs. There are tons of options on the market \u2014 new ones each month, it seems \u2014 so I recently refreshed my original search (which started with researching more than 30 trimmers, before testing a bunch from major electronics brands and digital upstarts alike). Below, the stand-outs, including some old favorites and a few promising newcomers.\n\nThe best overall electric beard trimmer\n\nPhilips Norelco Beard Trimmer Series 7200, Vacuum-Trimmer After two years of near-constant use, this remains my favorite trimmer, thanks to two obvious advantages: (1) a convenient radial dial that lets you easily choose lengths as short 0.5 millimeters (and in 0.5 millimenter increments up from there), which makes it plenty versatile; and (2) a vacuum-suction feature that collects the majority of your shaven hairs \u2014 up to 90 percent of them, according to the company, but who really knows? All I can say is that this is a godsend. No man likes wiping his (or his boyfriend\u2019s) stubble from the sink, and I\u2019m willing to deal with this shaver\u2019s slightly clunky handfeel to reap that reward. Plus, I can now report, its battery and blade holds up to months and months of wear and tear. $55 at Amazon Buy $55 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe lightest electric beard trimmer\n\nBrio Axis Trimmer with Travel Case The latest release from digital upstart Brio has all the features I liked from their original Beardscape \u2014 a nicely contoured shape, a charging stand that I wish every trimmer had, and a ceramic blade, which is supposedly four times harder than stainless steel (though more breakable, too) \u2014 but in a smaller, more portable package, which is why it is taking the place of the older model on this list. Using the included guides \u2014 those plastic combs that come with most of these \u2014 it\u2019s great for men who want shorter beards (from 3 mm to 6 mm) and, on its own, the narrow blade cuts down to 0.5 millimeters, my ideal starting point. It navigates corners and crevices well, though it did snag a few times on my stubble when I tested it, though that\u2019s a small price to pay in exchange for its simplicity, 90-minute battery life (the light around the button changes color when it\u2019s time to charge), and quiet charm. $45 at Amazon Buy $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe best professional-grade electric beard trimmer\n\nWahl Lithium Ion Stainless Steel Groomer $60 (was $70, now 14% off) You might think that the purpose of any beard trimmer is for it to work perfectly, expertly crafting each piece of micro-hair into the same length, but that\u2019s hardly the point when it comes to five o\u2019clock shadow. Messy is in! Still, I appreciated the incredibly sharp, pro-level blade; heavy stainless-steel body; and long-lasting battery (a four-hour charge) that this one offered. If you ignore any of its bonus features and beard guides, this tool is right for men who want an incredibly close, 0.5 millimeter shave without pulling out an electric foil razor or regular razor blade. I\u2019ll keep this one in my medicine cabinet for achieving what\u2019s essentially a clean shave \u2014 no shaving cream necessary \u2014 especially since it\u2019s shaped in a way that nicely weaves around lip corners and nose crevices. (Wahl also makes a vacuum-suction version that feels similarly strong, if a bit more awkward to wield than my No. 1 pick.) $60 at Amazon Buy $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe best electric beard trimmer that also cuts (head) hair\n\nAndis Professional T-Outliner Beard/Hair Trimmer with T-Blade As the kind of tool used in professional settings by barbers and the like for beard trims and edge cleanups, this device, with its heavy-duty detachable cord, has a nice substantial feel to it, an incredibly sharp carbon blade, and a switch that toggles on and off with a pleasing motion (small things matter, especially in the morning). Used alone, or with its set of guides, it\u2019s great for guys who want to tweak and trim all different kinds of beard lengths \u2014 from 0.5 millimeters up to 10 millimeters \u2014 and I could see it also being useful if you\u2019re the kind of person who wants someone (a partner, a haircutting friend) to give you an actual at-home haircut. $59 at Amazon Buy $59 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe best travel electric beard trimmer\n\nPhilips Norelco OneBlade This one is sort of a wild card. It\u2019s somewhere between a traditional beard trimmer and a regular razor (fittingly, it was named the best electric-cartridge hybrid razor on Strategist\u2019s round-up of the best razors for men), and requires a special OneBlade \u2014 which isn\u2019t sharp to the touch \u2014 that you\u2019re supposed to replace every four months or so. Once you charge the handle and turn on the power, the blade\u2019s rapid movements cut nearly as close as a regular disposable blade, but without any fear of bleeding or ingrown hairs. You can basically drag it all over your face haphazardly to eliminate all your facial hair, or use it to \u201cedge\u201d and \u201cshape\u201d for styles like goatees. Using it does feel slightly strange, like you\u2019re sweeping over your floor with a broom that doesn\u2019t work as well as a vacuum. And the results weren\u2019t the most pristine, so it\u2019s something I\u2019m saving for vacations, when it matters less. The small size, decent battery life, and punchy color make it just right for my Dopp kit. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Walmart Buy\n\nMore Strategist-approved beard-trimming tools\n\nAndis Slimline Pro Li T-blade Trimmer In our article on the best expert-recommended razors for men, many of the pros said that electric beard trimmers can be the best electric style of shaver if you\u2019ve got very sensitive skin, because a slightly less-close shave may result in less irritation. Paul Langevin of barbershop Mildred New York told us about this electric trimmer, which is more or less a cordless version of the Andis style that appears above. $54 at Amazon Buy $54 at Amazon Buy\n\nWahl Deluxe Aqua Blade Wet/Dry Beard Trimmer Kit If you\u2019re looking for an electric trimmer you can use in the shower (for easier cleanup), barber Miles Wood Smith recommended this Wahl wet/dry model when we asked him about all the different products you need to trim and maintain a beard. $60 at Amazon Buy $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhilips Norelco Beard & Head Trimmer Series 5100 $45 (was $50, now 10% off) When he grew a beard, Strategist writer David Notis maintained it using a different model from Philips Norelco, the brand behind our best overall electric trimmer. The style shown here is the newer version of Notis\u2019s electric beard trimmer, which he liked for its affordability. But the lower price comes with a trade-off: This does not have the vacuum-suction feature found in the top-rated model on this list. $45 at Amazon Buy $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nGroom Mate Stainless Steel Nose & Ear Hair Trimmer For most beards, any of the above electric trimmers will be all you need when it comes to maintenance. But if your beard incorporates a mustache or looks like it could be a prop from the Game of Thrones costume department (and we mean that in the best way), you might need a precision trimmer like this, from our list of the best manscaping tools, to ensure no wayward hair is left behind. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
