Going out for food and drink remains one of the city's favored pastimes. From posh food halls and tasting menus to wine bars and perfect Peruvian cuisine, London is a food lover's paradise.\n\nHere's a selection of London's current hot spots the next time you travel here:\n\nRelated content Visiting London? Insiders share their top tips\n\nArcade Food Theatre\n\nThe dining hall Arcade Food Theatre is all the rage thanks to an incredible lineup of vendors including pastry maker Pophams, pasta vendor Lina Stores and Turkish-Cypriot spot Oklava. Paul Winch-Furness/Arcade Food Theatre\n\nMultivendor indoor food markets have been opening all over London in the past couple of years, but the latest to hit the capital, Arcade Food Theatre, is already a cut above the rest.\n\nThis is in no small part because of the presence of T\u014cU , purveyors of 2019's most popular dish, Iberico pork katsu sando.\n\nAs well as offering up the original -- a thick breaded pork chop sandwiched between two slices of buttery brioche -- there's also a new vegetarian version with deep-fried tofu and wasabi egg mayo.\n\nT\u014cU is part of an incredible line up of vendors that includes Pophams (Instagram-worthy pastries); Lina Stores (fresh pasta from one of London's oldest Italian delis); and Oklava (Turkish-Cypriot flatbreads and more). All this, combined with three bars serving cocktails, wines and London-brewed beers, makes Arcade Food Theatre a high-class operation.\n\nArcade Food Theatre , 103-105 New Oxford St, London WC1A 1DB, United Kingdom; +44 20 7519 1202\n\nBao Borough\n\nBeginning as a small street food stand before opening up two very successful permanent restaurants, Bao is responsible for popularizing Taiwanese steamed buns in London.\n\nIn 2019, the team opened a third Bao restaurant, located on the doorstep of London's premier food market, Borough Market, and reminded everyone just how good they are.\n\nThe classic pillow-soft buns stuffed with the likes of pork belly or fried chicken are still as good as ever, but with each new incarnation, Bao seem to up their game with a variety of new dishes. Take the Xinjiang Maitake mushrooms, which come swimming in a cumin-laced rich sauce, or the spiced beef butter scallops, both exceptional dishes that have spawned many imitators in their wake.\n\nAnd if all that wasn't enough, the new Bao Borough also has a karaoke room, where you can sing and stuff your face with buns to your heart's content.\n\nBao Borough , 13 Stoney St, Borough Market, London SE1 9AD, United Kingdom; +44 20 3319 8132\n\nCora Pearl\n\nCovent Garden-based Cora Pearl, named for an infamous London \"working girl,\" turns out uncontroversial comforting dishes such as this fish stew. Cora Pearl\n\nLocated in the heart of Covent Garden, Cora Pearl is a beautiful little brasserie that stands out among the many neighboring tourist traps.\n\nOpened in 2018, it's the sister restaurant to the much-lauded Kitty Fishers in Mayfair, with both restaurants taking their name from infamous London \"working girls\" of the Victorian era. While Cora Pearl herself was a tad controversial, the restaurant named for her is anything but, with head chef George Barson turning out spectacular comforting classics.\n\nHighlights include an elevated take on the ham and cheese toastie, which sees ham hock and pig cheek wrapped up in a cheesy bechamel sauce and sandwiched in toasted white bread and the cow's curd agnolotti with pea puree and shaved truffle.\n\nOne of the best Sunday roasts in London can also be found here, with thinly sliced medium rare beef or tender pork belly served with crispy potatoes, broccoli, Yorkshire puddings, cauliflower cheese, carrots and lashings of gravy.\n\nCora Pearl , 30 Henrietta St, Covent Garden, London WC2E 8NA, United Kingdom; +44 20 7324 7722\n\nDa Terra\n\nThe Town Hall Hotel in east London has housed two exceptional restaurants -- Nuno Mendes' Viajante and Lee Westcott's Typing Room -- since it opened in 2010.\n\nChefs Paulo Airaudo (who runs the Michelin-starred Amelia in San Sebastian) and Rafael Cagali (formerly of Fera and Aulis) had pretty big shoes to fill when they took over the hotel's dining room to open Da Terra in January 2019, but they have more than lived up to their now-closed predecessors.\n\nDa Terra offers blind tasting menus (short for \u00a373 or long for \u00a390), and the food displays a mix of influences, from Rafael's Brazilian background to Spanish and Italian touch points.\n\nWhile the cooking is undoubtedly fine dining in its ambition, there is room for playful touches, too. Take the chicken liver mousse accompanied by fresh onion brioche and cubes of butter shaped like Lego blocks and the scallops served in a bowl of beach pebbles adorned by a plastic toy shark and diver.\n\nDarby's\n\nStaff at the US Embassy may turn to Darby's -- open from breakfast right through to dinner -- as a full-time canteen. Paul Winch-Furness/Darby's\n\nStaff at the old US Embassy in Grosvenor Square may have initially been worried about what they were going to have for lunch once they moved to the sparkling new Embassy building in Battersea in 2018. Compared with Mayfair, it's not a part of London with many eating options.\n\nBut now that Irish chef Robin Gill has opened his new restaurant Darby's next door, they have a de facto canteen to be envious of.\n\nOpen from breakfast right through to dinner, Darby's has a menu that's classic by nature -- oysters, grilled fish and steaks -- but it's all been executed with great care and attention.\n\nAn in-house bakery turns out freshly baked loaves and pastries on a daily basis. Produce is sourced from the best farmers and growers around the UK. Darby's isn't trying to reinvent the wheel, but when the classics are done this well, they're hard to beat.\n\nDarby's , 3 Viaduct Gardens, Nine Elms, London SW11 7AY, United Kingdom; +44 20 7537 3111\n\nEmilia\n\nThe owners of one of London's oldest restaurants, Quality Chop House, are also responsible for one of the city's newest and most talked about.\n\nLocated down a pretty Mayfair mews inside Bonhams auction house, Emilia is serving some of the best Italian food around. As the name suggests, the menu is inspired by the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy that's the home of Parmigiano-Reggiano, balsamic vinegar and many other famous foods.\n\nEmilia sensibly chooses to let the fresh ingredients speak for themselves.\n\nCreamy burrata is served simply with slices of sweet white peach and courgette fritti come with a sharp lemon mayonnaise for dunking. Fresh pastas steal the show, however, with the ricotta and walnut ravioli being trumped only by the pappardelle with venison ragu.\n\nBeing aligned with an auction house has more than just aesthetic benefits, too. As well as an \"everyday\" wine list, there's also a list of very special rare bottles from the Bonhams wine department.\n\nEmilia , 7 Haunch of Venison Yard, Mayfair, London W1K 5ES; +44 20 7468 5868\n\nFour Legs at The Compton Arms\n\nOne of the best cheeseburgers in the city can be found at Four Legs at the Compton Arms. Four Legs at The Compton Arms\n\nTucked down a quiet residential street in Islington, The Compton Arms was one of George Orwell's favorite watering holes, and partly inspired his essay \"The Moon Under the Water,\" in which he describes his ideal pub.\n\nThe Compton Arms recently had a bit of a makeover, getting a much needed lick of paint and welcoming in a brand new kitchen team in the process. The chef duo of Jamie Allan (formerly of butcher / restaurant Hill & Szrok) and Ed McIlroy (formerly of Bao) are now in charge at the pub, going by the name Four Legs in reference to \"Animal Farm.\"\n\nIn just a few short months, they've created quite a buzz.\n\nAlthough the menu changes regularly, there is one permanent item: the Dexter cheeseburger. It's had diners flocking to the place to try one of the best burgers in London. There's plenty more to love, too, with Korean fried chicken, fresh paratha breads and Japanese chicken skewers among the other regular favorites.\n\nFour Legs at The Compton Arms , 4 Compton Ave, Islington, London N1 2XD, United Kingdom; +44 20 7354 8473\n\nThe Garden Caf\u00e9\n\nAmong the lesser known museums of London is the Garden Museum in Lambeth, dedicated to the history of famous British gardens and horticultural pastimes. Perhaps unexpectedly, it also houses one of the capital's best hidden restaurant gems, The Garden Caf\u00e9, which opened in a modern glass extension of the museum in 2017.\n\nOpen for lunch every day, and dinner on Tuesdays and Saturdays, the caf\u00e9's menu changes every day, with dishes being created in line with seasonal British ingredients. The cooking is simple and pared back, with the quality of the produce allowed to shine.\n\nA typical menu might include mackerel served with fresh slices of cucumber, apple and kohlrabi, or runner beans with pickled walnuts and a poached egg. Desserts are a particular strong point, too, with classics such as the treacle tart or buttermilk with poached rhubarb guaranteed to leave a smile on your face.\n\nThe Garden Caf\u00e9 , 5 Lambeth Palace Road, Lambeth, London SE1 7LB, United Kingdom; +44 20 3640 9322\n\nRelated content Where to eat in London's Chinatown\n\nGloria / Circolo Popolare\n\nBig Mamma's restaurant Circolo Popular boasts a wall with 20,000 bottles -- a sure route to a night to remember. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Galland\n\nIt would be impossible to sum up London's latest dining hot spots and not include Gloria and Circolo Popolare, located in Shoreditch and Fitzrovia respectively.\n\nThese two Italian restaurants, opened just months apart by the French group Big Mamma, have been runaway hits, with long queues waiting for a table every night. Their success is even more impressive given that most people seem to think that the food is just 'OK' at best, with a menu of pizzas, pastas and other Italian staples.\n\nBut what they might lack in foodie credentials, they more than make up for in sheer let-your-hair-down fun.\n\nBoth are temples of outrageously over-the-top design, with every inch of space covered in plants, artwork, bright furniture, festoon lights, and mirrors -- Circolo even has a long wall covered in a staggering 20,000 bottles. They are loud, brash and bold, the kind of places you can come with a big group and maybe even misbehave a bit.\n\nAnd in these uncertain times, who can blame Londoners for going wild for that?\n\nGloria , 54-56 Great Eastern St, Hackney, London EC2A 3QR, United Kingdom,\n\nCircolo Popolare , 40-41 Rathbone Pl, Fitzrovia, London W1T 1HX, United Kingdom\n\nPachamama East\n\nThe Shoreditch offshoot of one of London's best Peruvian spots, Pachamama East, integrates Asian influences, too. Pachamama East\n\nPachamama East is the Shoreditch offshoot of one of London's best Peruvian restaurants, the original Pachamama in Marylebone.\n\nBefitting of its location in London's hipster heartland, the interiors are more modern than at its big sister, with exposed concrete, pastel colours and plants in the main restaurant area, and a sunken bar and a black-and-pink tiled staircase leading down to a private dining room.\n\nThe food is just as fresh as ever, with inventive ceviche such as the yellowfin tuna with pickled potato, the sea bass with nori and the smoked mushroom.\n\nAlthough still largely Peruvian, the new east location throws in some Asian influences, too, such as with the miso-cured carrot with black quinoa and kimchi.\n\nAdd killer Peruvian cocktails, regular guest chef pop ups, DJs and more ,and you've got one of east London's most fun places to eat out.\n\nPachamama East , 73 Great Eastern Street, Hackney, London EC2A 3HR, United Kingdom; +44 20 7846 9595\n\nSoutine\n\nChris Corbin and Jeremy King are London restaurant royalty, responsible for some of the capital's most celebrated restaurants such as The Wolseley and Brasserie Zedel.\n\nTheir latest project has taken them to the well-heeled neighbourhood of St John's Wood in northwest London to open Soutine, a classic French all-day bistro.\n\nThe menu is made up of French caf\u00e9 staples such as onion soup, croque monsieur, coq au vin, steak frites and confit de canard, all delivered with great aplomb.\n\nThe interiors are gorgeous, with aged wooden wall panels, oil paintings, decorative tiles and art deco lighting creating the look of a place that could have just as easily been around 100 years.\n\nIf Corbin and King have a trademark, however, it's making the classic feel contemporary and they've achieved that with Soutine, where the food is a perfect match for the elegant surroundings.\n\nSoutine , 60 St John's Wood High St, St John's Wood, London NW8 7SH, United Kingdom; +44 20 3926 8448\n\nTop Cuv\u00e9e\n\nReminiscent of a Paris bistro, Top Cuv\u00e9e offers standout dishes like beef and smoked eel tartar, and braised pig's cheek (pictured). Top Cuv\u00e9e\n\nLondon has been spoiled by the number of fantastic wine bars that have opened in recent years, many of them offering solid food menus to match.\n\nLatest to arrive, and already one of the best, is Top Cuv\u00e9e, located in the slightly unlikely neighborhood of Finsbury Park in north London, not far from Arsenal's soccer stadium.\n\nWhile the area is largely populated by pubs and cheap takeaways, Top Cuv\u00e9e is more reminiscent of a modern Parisian bistro, with its stripped back aesthetic -- think whitewashed walls and plain wooden furniture -- and menu of simple but delicious dishes.\n\nParticular standouts include the croquettes, hot crispy spheres stuffed with sweet potato and sage, and the beef and smoked eel tartare with wild garlic. The wine list is full of interesting bottles sourced directly from small, independent producers, and the staff is very friendly in recommending new things to try.\n\nTop Cuv\u00e9e , Blackstock Road, Highbury East, London N5 2LL, United Kingdom; +44 20 3294 1665\n\nSeabird\n\nThe Hoxton, Southwark opened at the beginning of September 2019 and, as well as being an excellent hotel choice for visitors to the capital, it also offers one of London's best new restaurants.\n\nLocated on the 14th floor rooftop of the hotel, Seabird is a seafood restaurant and bar created in partnership with the founders of the award-winning Maison Premiere in Brooklyn.\n\nAlong with stunning views of London landmarks including St Paul's, The Shard and Big Ben, Seabird offers cocktails, an impeccable wine selection and London's longest oyster list. Then there's the extravagant seafood towers of crab, langoustines, clams and one of London's hottest dishes of the moment, the octopus brioche roll.\n\nDon't miss the San Sebastian-inspired Manchego cheesecake for dessert either.", "description": "If you think London is a still a downer for foodies, you're at least 10 years behind.
