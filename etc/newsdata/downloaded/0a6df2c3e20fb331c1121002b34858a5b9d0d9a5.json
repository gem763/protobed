From there, Jones\u2019 men built their lead slowly but surely through the brilliant goal-kicking of recalled fly-half George Ford, who scored 12 points.\n\nThe flatness of the All Blacks\u2019 performance led to suggestions in Hansen\u2019s post-game press conference that his men had lacked the necessary hunger to match England\u2019s intensity \u2013 a theory the Kiwi angrily rejected.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

asked if the side had turned up with the \u201cright mentality\u201d.\n\n\u201cBecause I asked at half time for them to get hungrier doesn\u2019t mean to say they didn\u2019t turn up being hungry. There\u2019s a big difference. And if you want to spend some time outside I\u2019ll give you a rugby education on that one.\n\n\u201cBut to turn up and say the All Blacks team comes to a semi-final of a Rugby World Cup with the amount of ability and history it\u2019s had behind it, [to say] \u2018there\u2019s no hunger\u2019, that\u2019s a pretty average question I reckon.\u201d\n\nRead similarly insisted that his side\u2019s attitude was not the issue.\n\n\u201cI think they did [have the right attitude],\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cYou saw how hard we worked out there. The boys definitely wanted it.\n\n\u201cThe detail of the match didn\u2019t go our way but our work rate was there.\n\n\u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t go your way it\u2019s a hard thing to take and I know we\u2019re hurting.\u201d\n\nDespite such a confrontation, Hansen struck a magnanimous tone in defeat as he congratulated England on their victory.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to England, they played a tremendous game of footy and deserved to win,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot give them half a step, but they took it.\n\n\u201cI am really proud of our team, they have done a tremendous job, but we were not good enough. We take it on the chin, the boys tried their guts out and I am proud of them.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand\u00a0head coach Steve Hansen was left smarting at the suggestion his team \u201cdidn\u2019t turn up hungry\u201d in their Rugby World Cup semi-final defeat by England.
