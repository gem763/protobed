I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nThe future Hall of Famer settled in for a 3rd-and-1 play from the Kansas City 3-yard line during the sequence. Rodgers took a snap out of the shotgun formation before drawing the Chiefs\u2019 pass rush.\n\nThe Packers quarterback ran back toward the 30-yard line before heaving up a pass to the right side of the end zone, while falling on his back. The pass found Williams in the back of the end zone, giving the Packers a 24-17 edge with 14:05 remaining.\n\n\u201cI was actually throwing a ball that I thought maybe Jimmy [Graham] could go up and get if he wanted to and if he didn\u2019t the guy behind him might be able to get,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cLuckily, the guy behind him got it.\u201d\n\nThat man @AaronRodgers12\u2026\n\nTHIS THROW. #GoPackGo\n\n: #GBvsKC on NBC\n\n: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app\n\nWatch free on mobile: https://t.co/mDf84f0ihz pic.twitter.com/f7EeMjSoXZ\u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 28, 2019\n\nRodgers\u2019 throw had a 19.3 percent completion probability, according to NFL Next Gen Stats.

The Packers answered with Rodgers hooking up with Aaron Jones for a 67-yard touchdown on the next drive to take the lead for good.\n\nRodgers completed 23 of 33 passes for 305 yards and three scores in the win. Jones had 226 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns for the Packers.
