Ltd, which is under investigation for fraudulent activity.\n\nPart-time actor Keller always maintained his innocence and had no idea of the criminal activities the company was involved in.\n\nHis family had desperately appealed to US politicians including Gov. Greg Abbott and Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas.\n\nThe army veteran remained imprisoned until - after months of local news coverage on his case - he was found not guilty on September 30.\n\nDerrick Keller on flight home to Texas after being released from Thailand's Klong Pren prison in Bangkok\n\nAfter attempting to leave the country, Thai authorities detained him again, KHOU reported.\n\nU.S.Embassy officials finally escorted Keller onto an airplane bound for South Korea.\n\nIt is exceptional for an American facing serious charges to be acquitted by a Thai court.\n\nAccording to local media, Keller\u2019s family had been told that 95 percent of foreigners tried for a serious crime in Thai courts are found guilty.\n\nHis family wrote on his Facebook campaign page following his release: 'Just landed in Texas safe and sound, back with his family.\n\n'There are not enough words for how happy we feel. As a family, we are taking a few days to decompress and process our emotions. Derrick is looking forward to seeing his family, friends and supporters soon.\n\n'Thank you for all your support and prayers.'", "description": "US Navy Veteran Derrick Keller from Richmond, Texas was reunited with his wife and daughter at a South Korean airport on Tuesday after he was locked in Thai prison Klong Prem for 13 months.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/09/19529108-0-image-a-21_1570695176998.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
