But he wanted to do it responsibly.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAround the time he turned 30, the former hedge-fund worker from Connecticut cut out alcohol so he could focus on more important things, like his family and fitness.\n\nAt the same time, Shufelt told Fox Business, he didn\u2019t want to miss out on the social and nostalgic experiences often associated with drinking. So he came up with a plan: Create a company to manufacture non-alcoholic beers that were both good-tasting and clean.\n\nThat way, he could drink and feel good about it.\n\n\u201cI saw the impact reducing alcohol had on my own life,\" he said.\n\n\"And I wanted to share that impact with others. We wanted to make a positive impact on millions of adult lives,\" by offering an alternative to traditional beer for people across the United States.\n\nAlong with cofounder John Walker, Shufelt created Athletic Brewing Co. with that in mind.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy getting the company off the ground. The pair were rejected by countless distributors, tallied up more than 100 investor meetings to find someone willing to back the project and whipped up endless batches of homebrew to create the perfect recipe.\n\nIt took years to get it right, Shufelt said, but after going beyond traditional market research and business planning, they came up with a specially unique method of producing non-alcoholic craft beer.\n\nThen they built a 10,000-square-foot brewery.\n\nThe beers, manufactured in southern Connecticut, come canned in packages of six with boutique labels and bright colors for about $13. They tout quirky names like \u201cUpside Dawn\u201d and \u201cStump Jump.\u201d\n\nOffering IPAs, lager and stouts, the drinks \"taste like true craft beers,\u201d Shufelt said, \u201cand have been awarded in competitions alongside full-strength alcoholic beers.\" Plus, \"our flagships are organic and contain 50 to 70 calories.\u201d The average craft has 300 calories.\n\nAthletic sells online and brews on tap and in cans at about 25 breweries, as well as in select bars and restaurants. It also distributes to more than 2,000 stores nationwide.\n\nShufelt thinks there\u2019s a market for the drinks. After all, a 2018 survey found that more than 20 percent of millennials are drinking less alcohol in order to be health-conscious. And the entrepreneur is targeting them.\n\n\u201cWe want Athletic beers to be a positive choice that our customers are proud of,\" he said, \"whether you want to feel good for a workout, be mindful when spending time with family or be responsible at a work event.\u201d\n\nHe says the response has been great: \u201cThere is a true community around non-alcoholic craft beer \u2014 enthusiastic adults from all walks of life,\u201d Shufelt said. \u201cFrom the outset, we have found the educational hurdles to be much lower than we expected, and instead, we're finding a population of ready adults who were disappointed with a previously neglected category.\u201d\n\nDavid Piece is one of those adults: \u201cI'm on a long quest to find a beverage that tastes like beer but doesn't end with me super drunk on a Monday,\u201d he said on Twitter, \u201cand Athletic Brewing seems like it might be the perfect thing.\u201d\n\nAllie Lundberg is another: \u201cBless @AthleticBrewing for being at the Park Ridge Oktoberfest!\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThis 8-month pregnant lady enjoyed feeling like she could partake in the festivities!\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest issue now is capacity. In just 18 months of being operational, they\u2019re getting orders quicker than they can fill them.\n\n\u201cUpside Dawn\u201d won a silver medal in the 2018 New York International Beer Competition. When Double Hop IPA went online earlier this year, it sold out in just 32 seconds. And the company, overall, with 16 employees, is on track to increase revenue tenfold year over year, Shufelt said.\n\nAthletic has seen increased interest from professional sports stadiums, too, including from MetLife Stadium, which brought it on for the 2019 season. It\u2019s also hosting the first non-alcoholic Oktoberfest at its brewery this fall, where it will debut three new crafts.\n\nThe beers \"are for any occasion and any time,\u201d Shufelt said. And the journey, so far, \u201chas been overwhelming and awesome.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "", "authors": ["Shawn M.
