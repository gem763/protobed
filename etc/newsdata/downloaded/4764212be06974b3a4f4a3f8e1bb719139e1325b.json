The newly discovered victims are thought to have come from the same herd.\n\nThe ravines usually fill up with gushing water during the rainy season.\n\nManeerat said the death toll of 11 is the highest number of elephants to die in a single incident in Khao Yai, where the elephant population is estimated to be about 300. Eight elephants died at the same waterfall almost 30 years ago.", "description": "Discovery comes days after six elephants fell to their deaths in the same spot", "authors": ["Associated Press In Bangkok"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b841f9820c77d3d1a40c49c838b47da7ae2e7c7/0_1237_14963_8976/master/14963.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1957411e171be30fc46f1311b441176c", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
