Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic sees its stocks soar in NYSE debut", "language": "en", "text": "Richard Branson-backed Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, becoming the first space tourism company to hit public markets.\n\nThe stock opened at $12.01 and rose more than 9%.\n\nThe company was created from the merger between British billionaire Branson's Virgin Galactic and former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya's publicly-traded shell company, which invested $800 million for a 49% stake.\n\nMerging with an already-public company allowed Branson's space venture to sidestep the traditional initial public offering process, including filing extensive paperwork with the U.S. SEC.\n\nSir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Galactic, poses for a photo outside the New York Stock Exchange as fireworks are exploded before his company's IPO on Monday\n\nShares of Richard Branson-backed Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (SPCE.N) jumped in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday\n\nRichard Branson-backed Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, becoming the first space tourism company to hit public markets\n\nThe listing comes during a dry spell for IPOs following failed attempts including office-share startup The We Company and disappointing debuts such as fitness startup Peloton Interactive Inc.\n\nTaking tourists to space for $250,000 a pop SpaceShipTwo is designed to carry six paying customers into space and is being manufactured in Mojave, California. Virgin Galactic currently has one operational SpaceShipTwo craft, the VSS Unity, which has completed two test flights to suborbital space and more under construction. The spaceplane is currently getting a revamp of its cabin at the Mojave Spaceship Co. facilities but could be up and running by sometime next year, reports Space. Those wishing to be on board the pioneering commercial space flight must fork out \u00a3194,000 ($250,000) each - more than 600 people have reserved tickets so far. Unlike competitors including SpaceX and Blue Origin the ship will be launched using a separate carrier plane, known as WhiteKnightTwo, which will take it to 50,000 feet (15,000 meters), releasing it before the SpaceShipTwo's engines ignite.\n\nBranson, with a 51% stake, retains control of the company which had a market cap of $2.3 billion following the announcement of the merger completion on Friday. Palihapitiya is chairman of the combined company.\n\nBranson is racing against competitors Blue Origin, the space business of Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk's SpaceX to bring tourists into space.\n\nHe said of the listing: 'If the public want to dabble a little bit in a spaceship company, own a little bit of a spaceship company, they can now do so.'\n\nHundreds of people from 60 countries, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber, have paid or put down deposits to fly on one of Virgin's suborbital flights.\n\nCEO George Whitesides said: 'Virgin Galactic is making history again today as it becomes the world's first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company.\n\n'For the first time, anyone will have the opportunity to invest in a human spaceflight company that is transforming the market.'\n\nSome of Virgin Galactic's ticket holders have been waiting over 14 years for their trip.\n\nA 90-minute flight, which allows passengers to experience a few minutes of weightlessness, costs about $250,000.\n\nVirgin's current reservations represent about $80 million in total collected deposits and $120 million of potential revenue.\n\nThe company has attracted a $20 million investment from Boeing Co to commercialize space.
