But after that, the scoring dried up like a sponge in the Sahara last year as the Oilers missed the playoffs for the 12th time in 13th seasons in 2018-19.\n\nThat triggered yet another front-office shuffle, starting with new general manager Ken Holland and Tippett, along with other wholesale changes in the scouting and player development departments.\n\nRepairs to bottom 6 forwards\n\nHolland, hoping to match his success with the Detroit Red Wings, without a lot of salary cap room to play with, spent the summer trying to shore up the bottom six forward group. He signed free agents such as Markus Granlund, Joakim Nygard, Riley Sheahan, and Gaetan Haas.\n\nThe goal is to find a gem among the new crew up front, similar to what walk-on Alex Chiasson did for Edmonton last season when he scored a career-best 22 goals.\n\n\"There are jobs that are open,\" said Tippett. \"It's jobs on the team, it's ice time, it's roles, and there are a lot of different people that are vying for those roles.\"\n\nAlex Chiasson, right, provided a spark up front for the Oilers last season alongside Leon Draisaitl. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe Oilers will have to make do without winger Jesse Puljujarvi, the top pick from 2016 who has not lived up to expectations. He was pegged in a third-line role this season, but is now playing in Finland while in a standoff with Oilers management.\n\nHolland also dealt underperforming forward Milan Lucic (and his $6-million US salary for this season) to Calgary for James Neal, who is also getting big bucks long term and aims to rebound from a subpar seven-goal season.\n\nOn defence, Holland and Tippett have their fingers crossed that young guns like Evan Bouchard and Philip Broberg will soon be ready for prime time while in the meantime relying on veterans Oscar Klefbom, Adam Larsson, Darnell Nurse, Matt Benning and Kris Russell to carry the load.\n\nThe Oilers still need a puck-moving D-man, having parted ways with veteran Andrej Sekera.\n\nNew addition in net\n\nIn goal, Holland has brought in 37-year-old Mike Smith from Calgary with the plan he will push inconsistent Mikko Koskinen and move the goaltending dial, if nothing else, out of liability territory.\n\nThere's lots of work to do.\n\nThe Oilers finished 25th overall last season and at 35-38-9 missed the playoffs by 17 points. The offence was mediocre (ranked 20th at 2.79 goals per game), the defence was worse (ranked 25th at 3.30 goals against a game).\n\nThe power play was better than average (ninth) but the penalty kill was brutal (30th).\n\nNevertheless, in Edmonton, where fans bleed blue and orange, hope is renewed that maybe this year the phoenix will rise from what has become hockey's perennial dumpster fire.\n\n\"Everyone's excited to get going,\" said forward Zack Kassian, who had a career year last season with 15 goals.\n\n\"Everyone in that room feels we have something to prove. As a team, we haven't performed the way we wanted to.\n\n\"That's our goal, just to make the playoffs.\"", "description": "The Edmonton Oilers opened training camp Thursday with all eyes on, well, Connor McDavid's left knee.
