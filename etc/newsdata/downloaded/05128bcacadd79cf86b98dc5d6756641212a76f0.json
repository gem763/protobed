He\u2019s the guy who overpaid for Vaulter, the irreverent new media site that must have seemed like a cred-building alternative to ATN, which seems to appeal to the angriest white people in the retirement home. He\u2019s the guy who wore those conspicuous $500 Lanvin sneakers to a meeting with Manhattan artists looking for a sponsor. (The New Yorker referred to it as \u201ca tactical shoe error.\u201d) In fact, his entire vision for Waystar is premised on a break from ossified assets, like his father\u2019s push for local TV stations last season. The Waystar of the future must be attuned to whatever trendy thing will make him seem forward-thinking and hip.\n\nAnd so in \u201cDundee,\u201d before the family members, business associates, and local officials gathered in Scotland for a surprise celebration of Logan\u2019s 50th year in the business, we witness the mortifying spectacle of a tribute rap, with beats by DJ Squiggle and rhymes by the hollowed soul with the custom jersey and bowtie. Here are the four flavors of reaction shots to Kendall\u2019s musical debut:\n\n1. Uh, what\u2019s about to happen here?\n\n2. Ironic enjoyment. (\u201cIt\u2019s burning my eyes but I can\u2019t look away.\u201d)\n\n3. Total shock.\n\n4. Trying to get into a groove that does not exist.\n\nKendall\u2019s ill-advised foray into rap music recalls \u201cMC Rove,\u201d a notorious number from the Radio and Television Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner in 2007, when Brad Sherwood and Colin Mochrie of Whose Line It It Anyway? brought the once-feared Republican consultant Karl Rove on stage for a similarly stilted comic bit. Even the writers of Succession couldn\u2019t hope to top the spectacle of the gravel-voiced Rove flailing awkwardly around the stage, but \u201cMC Rove\u201d was at least intended as parody. Kendall delivers his rhymes in earnest (\u201cDon\u2019t get it twisted, I\u2019ve been through hell / But since I stan dad, I\u2019m alive and well\u201d), peppered with a little Roy family invective to give them some edge. Maybe the best part is how he emphasizes the OG in Logan (\u201cL to the OG) and leaves AN to drift off into the ether. We love you, Log.\n\nThe rest of \u201cDundee\u201d\u2014and honestly, it\u2019s not easy to remember that there\u2019s anything else happening in this episode\u2014carries over the Rhea-related drama from last week, as Shiv looks to avenge getting played so badly. (\u201cWe need to fuck her from 100 different directions at 1,000 miles per hour,\u201d she tells her siblings, to a largely muted response.) Though Rhea probably doesn\u2019t know the extent to which the Roy family is a viper\u2019s nest, she proves a quick study on how to do damage control and ingratiate herself to the right people. But not before Shiv plants a seed in Marcia\u2019s head about the new woman in her husband\u2019s life, or enlists Kendall to have her offer a toast to Logan\u2019s late sister Rose, who\u2019s the sorest of sore subjects from his past. She\u2019s also made unaware of Logan\u2019s aversion to surprises, which makes the entire process of throwing the party and recording the tribute video amount to one large conspiracy against her.\n\nRhea faces some terrible blowback, especially from Marcia, who asks her if she is regularly tested for sexually transmitted diseases. (The phrase \u201cregularly tested\u201d is particularly sinister in its implication that Rhea could need to get tested often.) But the Roy children are so susceptible to plays on their vanity, so it doesn\u2019t take more than a line or two for her to turn Roman (\u201cI get your rep. Some labels take a while to peel off, but I happen to think you have a best instincts of all of them.\u201d) and Kendall. (\u201cWhen we\u2019re out on the other side of this all, it\u2019s you. It\u2019s always been you.) Roman and Kendall are so far on the outs with their father that they crave this sort of flattery, especially coming from the woman who currently has his ear. She\u2019s teasing out the possibility of what might happen when they come in from the cold.\n\nIn the end, though, Shiv finds a more substantive way to screw over Rhea than to make things awkward with Marcia or to touch on one of Logan\u2019s sore spots inadvertently. When news surfaces that a longtime accountant in cruises has damaging information on the payouts and shadow logs that covered up abhorrent misconduct in the division, Shiv comes to understand that a new CEO would suffer huge damage to her reputation. And so she decides to allow her father to enjoy his evening without knowing the accountant is prepared to come forward, and she gives him her implied blessing on Rhea as CEO, which has the added benefit of impressing her father with her magnanimity. (Incredibly, her dad doesn\u2019t suspect he\u2019s being played.)\n\nThe real rot underneath \u201cDundee,\u201d however, is the phony mythology that props up the Logan Roy story. He\u2019s returning to his humble beginnings in Scotland, where he\u2019s been honored with a plaque and a tour of Dundee University, which features the Logan Roy School of Journalism. (\u201cWhat\u2019s next? The Jack the Ripper Women\u2019s Health Clinic?,\u201d his brother quips.) His kids are under the impression that he quite literally didn\u2019t have a pot to piss in, and that the road to billions was an improbable rags-to-riches tale. (\u201cHe had to shit outside, right?,\u201d asks Connor. \u201cSometimes I think I\u2019ll never truly understand dad until I shit outside.\u201d) But one glimpse at his cozy childhood home renders it such an obvious fiction that Logan won\u2019t even get out of the car for a quick tour and a photo-op. He wants to get out of town with his bullshit intact.\n\nSad Sack Wasp Traps\n\n\u2022 The week\u2019s funniest subplot involves Willa\u2019s play, Sands, becoming Connor\u2019s own personal Heaven\u2019s Gate. He makes excuses for the first preview performance, which is filled with place-holder lines due to a mysterious virus that\u2019s infected Willa. He tells Kendall that what he saw was \u201cthe worst it could be\u201d and that it would only get better. But Greg soberly reports that there might be mites \u201cthriving\u201d in the nine metric tons of sand that\u2019s been dumped on stage, and the project is such a debacle that one of the actresses, Jennifer, has skipped town for a fling with Kendall. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to talk to the sand supplier like everyone else\u201d is a line for the ages.\n\n\u2022 Connor does get the best tribute video, however. \u201cI super-love you, superdad.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Greg assessing the single Scottish protestor with the \u201cRoy Cunt\u201d sign: \u201cI feel like it\u2019s weirder with one protester, like you don\u2019t know whether to make eye contact.\u201d Surely this is a reference to Janey Godley\u2019s lone protest in Scotland when Donald Trump turned up to celebrate the passage of Brexit.\n\n\u2022 Roman\u2019s streak of failed party surprises, like the satellite launch during Shiv\u2019s wedding or the call to a Pierce surrogate during the Hungarian retreat, continues with his purchase of the wrong local soccer club. The real kicker comes from Karl, who says, \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m horrible at gift-buying. Always get the wrong thing.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Kendall\u2019s inability to square up to Jennifer and end their fling face-to-face is a reminder that he is, in fact, a weak and craven human being. A tragic arc isn\u2019t necessarily a redemptive one.", "description": "The mortifying spectacle of an unwelcome tribute celebration reveals the phony mythology that props up the Logan Roy story.
