By the 1970s, that number fell to one in 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, one in two males is at risk of developing some form of cancer and for women, the chances are one in three.\n\nTreating cancer as a category generated $US9.9 billion in annual venture capital funding in 2019, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30 per cent over five years. Late-cycle pundits are investigating whether this may overlay into IPO opportunities.\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, new hopes and opportunities may be found in what is being pre-emptively (still requiring a proof of concept) referred to as the \u201cfourth wave in cancer treatment\u201d, found in the emerging field of chromatin biology.\n\nAlthough this is a new area of oncology for many, since 1910, six Nobel Prizes have been awarded to molecular biologists who have shed light on important aspects of chromatin bioscience.\n\nAcademic research has unveiled the role that mutations in chromatin, the regulatory system for our DNA, play in the development of a wide variety of cancers and other diseases.\n\nBased on this understanding, there are a variety of potential therapeutic approaches that could treat cancer through targeting mutated chromatin.\n\nTrailblazing this path are two US funds, Flagship Pioneering and OrbiMed Advisors, which are investing heavily into dedicated chromatin-remodelling companies.\n\nOne of these is Foghorn Therapeutics, a portfolio company of Flagship Pioneering, which is trying to commercialise chromatin regulation and present it as a foundational approach to treating not only cancer but other diseases including arthritis and lupus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, global spending on oncology therapeutics and supportive care was $US133 billion in 2017 and estimated to rise to $US200 billion by 2022 (10-13 per cent CAGR), with US spending expected to reach $US100 billion in 2022 (12-15 per cent CAGR).\n\nChromatin regulation offers a novel approach to cancer therapeutics and could command a significant share of this global market and it may answer the question as to where growth can be found this late in the cycle.\n\nStirling Larkin is chief investment officer of Australian Standfirst (www.australianstandfirst.com).", "description": "Chromatin biology is on the radar of those looking for the last growth spurts of the current bull cycle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d5d85b26aa1b0ae5092ae4ab2347cb26fadea57d", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
