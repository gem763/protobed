Both sets of supporters will encounter difficulty getting to and from the stadium.\n\n\"A consequence of such a disdainful, zero-consideration change means LFC's following fixture, at home to Wolves, is also to be moved to Sunday 29 December, again with inconvenience and negative implications for fans and workers.\n\n\"The Premier League and TV companies repeatedly ignore the welfare of supporters. But they do have a chance to redeem themselves. Spirit of Shankly call on the authorities to do the right thing and revert all Boxing Day fixtures to a sensible kick-off time. We suggest 3pm.\"\n\nLiverpool have already pre-empted fans' annoyance by offering free coach travel although the club are charging a \u00a35 reservation fee, with proceeds going to a local charity.\n\nThe Football Supporters' Association has indicated it will continue to raise the issue of short-notice fixture changes at its next supporter engagement meeting with the Premier League.\n\nDecember fixtures\n\nTuesday 3 December 2019\n\n19:30 Crystal Palace v AFC Bournemouth (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n20:15 Burnley v Man City (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\nWednesday 4 December 2019\n\n19:30 Chelsea v Aston Villa (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n19:30 Leicester v Watford (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n19:30 Man Utd v Spurs (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n19:30 Southampton v Norwich (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n19:30 Wolves v West Ham (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n20:15 Liverpool v Everton (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\nThursday 5 December 2019\n\n19:30 Sheff Utd v Newcastle (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n20:15 Arsenal v Brighton (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\nSaturday 7 December 2019\n\n12:30 Everton v Chelsea (BT Sport)\n\n17:30 Man City v Man Utd (Sky Sports)\n\nSunday 8 December 2019\n\n14:00 Aston Villa v Leicester (Sky Sports)\n\n14:00 Newcastle v Southampton\n\n14:00 Norwich v Sheff Utd\n\n16:30 Brighton v Wolves (Sky Sports)\n\nMonday 9 December 2019\n\n20:00 West Ham v Arsenal (Sky Sports)\n\nSaturday 14 December 2019\n\n12:30 Liverpool v Watford (BT Sport)\n\n17:30 Southampton v West Ham (Sky Sports)\n\nSunday 15 December 2019\n\n14:00 Man Utd v Everton (Sky Sports)\n\n14:00 Wolves v Spurs\n\n16:30 Arsenal v Man City (Sky Sports)\n\nMonday 16 December 2019\n\n20:00 Crystal Palace v Brighton (Sky Sports)\n\nSaturday 21 December 2019\n\n12:30 Everton v Arsenal (BT Sport)\n\n17:30 Man City v Leicester (Sky Sports)\n\nSunday 22 December 2019\n\n14:00 Watford v Man Utd (Sky Sports)\n\n16:30 Spurs v Chelsea (Sky Sports)\n\nThursday 26 December 2019 - Boxing Day\n\n12:30 Spurs v Brighton (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n15:00 AFC Bournemouth v Arsenal (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n15:00 Aston Villa v Norwich (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n15:00 Chelsea v Southampton (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n15:00 Crystal Palace v West Ham (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n15:00 Everton v Burnley (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n15:00 Sheff Utd v Watford (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n17:30 Man Utd v Newcastle (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n20:00 Leicester v Liverpool (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\nFriday 27 December 2019\n\n19:45 Wolves v Man City (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\nSaturday 28 December 2019\n\n12:30 Brighton v AFC Bournemouth (Sky Sports)\n\n17:30 Norwich v Spurs (Sky Sports)\n\n17:30 West Ham v Leicester\n\n19:45 Burnley v Man Utd (BT Sport)\n\nSunday 29 December 2019\n\n14:00 Arsenal v Chelsea (Sky Sports)\n\n16:30 Liverpool v Wolves (Sky Sports)\n\n18:00 Man City v Sheff Utd\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nJanuary fixtures\n\nWednesday 1 January 2020\n\n12:30 Brighton v Chelsea (BT Sport)\n\n12:30 Burnley v Aston Villa (BT Sport)\n\n15:00 Newcastle v Leicester (BT Sport)\n\n15:00 Southampton v Spurs (BT Sport)\n\n15:00 Watford v Wolves (BT Sport)\n\n17:30 Man City v Everton (BT Sport)\n\n17:30 Norwich v Crystal Palace (BT Sport)\n\n17:30 West Ham v AFC Bournemouth (BT Sport)\n\n20:00 Arsenal v Man Utd (BT Sport)\n\nThursday 2 January 2020\n\n20:00 Liverpool v Sheff Utd (BT Sport)\n\nFriday 10 January 2020\n\n20:00 Sheff Utd v West Ham (Sky Sports)\n\nSaturday 11 January 2020\n\n12:30 Crystal Palace v Arsenal (BT Sport)\n\n17:30 Spurs v Liverpool (Sky Sports)\n\nSunday 12 January 2020\n\n14:00 AFC Bournemouth v Watford (Sky Sports)\n\n16:30 Aston Villa v Man City (Sky Sports)\n\nSaturday 18 January 2020\n\n12:30 Watford v Spurs (BT Sport)\n\n17:30 Newcastle v Chelsea (Sky Sports)\n\nSunday 19 January 2020\n\n14:00 Burnley v Leicester (Sky Sports)\n\n16:30 Liverpool v Man Utd (Sky Sports)\n\nTuesday 21 January 2020\n\n19:30 AFC Bournemouth v Brighton\n\n19:30 Aston Villa v Watford\n\n19:30 Crystal Palace v Southampton\n\n19:30 Everton v Newcastle\n\n19:30 Sheff Utd v Man City (BT Sport)\n\n20:15 Chelsea v Arsenal (BT Sport)\n\nWednesday 22 January 2020\n\n19:30 Leicester v West Ham (BT Sport)\n\n19:30 Spurs v Norwich\n\n20:15 Man Utd v Burnley (BT Sport)\n\nThursday 23 January 2020\n\n20:00 Wolves v Liverpool (BT Sport)", "description": "Sky Sports, BT Sport and Amazon will all show Premier League fixtures in December and January", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20375775.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Manchester-United-v-Arsenal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
