Boris Johnson came short of pushing through his newly brokered arrangement with the EU to let Great Britain go its own way.\n\nI have to say, in a way, it was weird the U.S. stock market sold off on the news since many financial types want to see the UK stay ensconced in the European Union. I think this points to fatigue on both sides of the Atlantic, where even those that warned of economic doom want to see the drama come to an end. After Donald Tusk threw his support behind yet another delay, we could see this saga start all over again.\n\nIt remains to be seen what Johnson does next, but it looks like he may have no choice other than to go back to the people again for a new vote. Sadly, those that say they\u2019ll honor the voice of the people in a new vote are sure to change their minds again. It boils down to this fact, the arrangement is hugely beneficial to many, including those in financial markets and those looking for cheaper language.\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nI know Wall Street just wants it all to be over. No matter how much angst and fearmongering come with major negotiations, around the world it\u2019s the will of the people, and western democracies should pay attention to a planet with lots of Main Street uprising.\n\nLet United Kingdom Go\n\nGet to a China Trade Deal\n\nSign USMCA into Law\n\nThese are not death sentences, on the contrary, they will breathe new life into societies and economies.\n\nMore Signs Manufacturers See a Deal\n\nLast week, it was the Philly Fed Manufacturing report that saw a major bifurcation between current conditions and future business anticipation. Yesterday, the Richmond Fed saw a nice October rebound from a negative read in September.\n\nRichmond Fed Manufacturing Report\n\nWhile current conditions saw impressive gains, there were large surges in business expectations in the next six-months. These numbers are huge, and once again add credence to my theory of a deal or significant movement toward a deal in the next six months.\n\nRichmond Fed Manufacturing Report Current Future October September October September New Orders 7 -14 33 22 Shipments 4 -14 24 15 # Employees 13 3 20 16 Work Week 10 -10 15 8 Capacity Utilization 7 -11 27 21\n\nMarket Breadth\n\nAlthough major indices slipped into the close, market breadth wasn\u2019t too bad.\n\nNYSE\n\nAdvancers 1,719\n\nDecliners 1,220\n\nUp Volume 1.86 billion\n\nDown Volume 1.15 billion\n\nNew Highs 175\n\nNew Lows 28\n\nNASDAQ\n\nAdvancers 1,482\n\nDecliners 1,636\n\nUp Volume 776.7 million\n\nDown Volume 834.3 million\n\nNew Highs 109\n\nNew Lows 79\n\nPortfolio Approach\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 3 2 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 2 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 3 1 1 Technology Utilities Cash 3 0 1\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nThe market is showing remarkable pre-open resolve despite weak earnings misses from Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Texas Instruments (TXN).

Texas Instruments (TXN) reported earnings that also disappointed and the stock is getting hit to the tune of 8%.
