Patient, curious, broadly cultured, and so on? I\u2019m not\u2014not anymore. Decades of email-checking have splintered my concentration; more recently and speedily, I\u2019ve rotted out my attention span with Netflix and end-of-the-republic updates. Of the new mind, the prodigious and fluently networking postdigital mind, I am not in possession; I have only the perishing old mind, bleaching in chunks like the Great Barrier Reef. To sit in a chair, in a pool of educated light, and turn the pages of a novel \u2026 No chance. I twitch, I bounce. I start reaching for things. Then I get groggy.\n\nSoho Press\n\nSo when somebody writes a book that grips and settles me, that makes a reader out of me again, I become quite helpless with gratitude. I feel this way about Mick Herron. Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, in England, and educated at Oxford, Herron writes squeakingly well-plotted spy thrillers. More than that, he composes\u2014at the rate of a pulpist\u2014the kind of efficient, darkly witty, tipped-with-imagery sentences that feel purpose-built to perforate my private daze of illiteracy. More than that, he\u2019s a world-bringer, the creator of a still-growing fictional universe with its own gravity, lingo, and surface tension. He whacks his characters and winnows his cast with real 21st-century anti-sentimentality, but there always seems to be enough life-energy around to generate more stories. A TV series is in the works, and a new novel, Joe Country, was published in June.\n\nAt the center of Herron\u2019s mythosphere is a terrible, terrible office: Slough House. Although \u2026 can Slough House be at the center of anything? It\u2019s a terminus, permanently dislodged from\u2014at odds with, even\u2014the flow of existence. A grimly nondescript building somewhere in the London borough of Finsbury, a concrescence of London dilapidation and anonymity, Slough House is where you\u2019ll find the \u201cslow horses\u201d\u2014the MI5 operatives deemed too dysfunctional, addicted, high-risk, or failure-prone for anything but the most grinding busywork. J. K. Coe is there, monastically hoodied, sizzling with PTSD, listening to Keith Jarrett in his earbuds and not talking to anyone. Shirley Dander is there, always thinking about the wrap of cocaine in her pocket. (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Shirley was an habitual user. It was a weekend thing with her, strictly Thursday to Tuesday.\u201d) The manager of Slough House, its twice-as-toxic David Brent, its stained and farting Buddha, is Jackson Lamb. Once a formidable \u201cjoe\u201d\u2014Herron-speak for an agent\u2014at Berlin Station, Lamb is now a chain-smoking, whiskey-drinking shambles and a creature of coal-black cynicism. Herron\u2019s slow horses are always being pulled into plots, called upon to exercise their latent joe skills. As rejects, they are the natural enemies of the elite. They can smell a false-flag operation a mile off. No fake news for these genuine losers. In Joe Country, a hunt for the missing son of a deceased slow horse leads to an encounter with the most infernal echelons of the Establishment.", "description": "The author writes about the broken spies sworn to protect a broken England.", "authors": ["James Parker", "Mick Herron"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/08/CULT_Omnivore_HerronHomePageCrop/facebook.jpg?1567604692", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
