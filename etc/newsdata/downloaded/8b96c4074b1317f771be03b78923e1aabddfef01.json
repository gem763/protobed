She was reported missing by her husband in February 2002 several days after he last saw her. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said at the time it had evidence indicating she died on February 21, 2002, after a fight with her husband.\n\nThe appeals court rejected claims by Jerry Meek that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of murder.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has upheld the life prison sentence of a 42-year-old man convicted of killing his wife.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2015-08-27"}
