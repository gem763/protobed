If you want to quickly find text to read through \u2014 say, a certain explosive report that was just released as an unsearchable PDF \u2014 you can use Adobe Acrobat Pro\u2019s optical character recognition to convert scanned documents into fully editable PDFs with searchable text.\n\nJust open up your PDF in Adobe Acrobat, and click on the \u201cEdit PDF\u201d tool on the right-side menu. Depending on how big your file is, it might take a few minutes to fully convert the file. Once it\u2019s done, you can hit Ctrl+F to search through the text. When you\u2019re ready to export, you can go to File > Save As to save your new editable document.\n\nYou can go into settings under Scanned Documents on the right-hand menu for more options, like changing the OCR language, choosing system fonts, and making all the pages editable in one go.\n\nNote that Adobe Acrobat is different from Adobe Reader, which is a free app that only lets you open and read PDFs. Depending on your Creative Cloud subscription, Adobe Acrobat might come bundled with your apps, or you can subscribe to the app for $14.99 a month for Windows and Macs. You can always try out its week-long free trial before you commit, though, so happy searching!", "description": "Adobe Acrobat Pro\u2019s optical character recognition feature converts scanned documents into editable PDFs.
