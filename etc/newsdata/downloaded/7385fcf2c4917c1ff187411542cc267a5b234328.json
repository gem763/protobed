Now other representatives from the UK have joined in.\n\nA spokesperson for the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is the leader of the global Anglican communion, declined to comment on Davies\u2019 remarks.\n\nThe Anglican communion, which comprises some 80 million members of autonomous but connected churches in 38 provinces, has been riven over the issue of LGBT equality and same-sex marriage for decades.\n\nTwo years ago the Scottish Episcopal church was effectively sanctioned by global church leaders for its acceptance of same sex marriage. The US church faced similar punitive action in 2016 for its stance welcoming marriage equality.\n\nAt the time, Anglican primates issued a statement in support of the \u201ctraditional doctrine\u201d that marriage should be between a man and a woman, while acknowledging the \u201cdeep pain\u201d of the divisions within the communion. Differences are becoming more marked, and some believe a split in the global church cannot be avoided.\n\nThe issue is expected to dominate next summer\u2019s Lambeth conference 2020 \u2013 a once-in-a-decade gathering of more than 1,200 Anglican bishops from around the world in Canterbury, England.\n\nBishops belonging to Gafcon, an alliance of conservatives deeply opposed to LGBT+ equality, have announced plans for an alternative gathering in Rwanda.\n\nThe Bishop of Liverpool told the Guardian: \u201cI still hope that bishops from Sydney will attend the Lambeth conference next year so that we can all talk together and learn from one another there.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, I\u2019m glad that other parts of the Australian church are engaging in dialogue with Sydney and are advocating for a greater inclusion and a wider and more diverse church. It\u2019s good to be in the same communion with all these people.\u201d\n\nOther Church of England bishops declined to comment on Davies\u2019 comments, saying they did not represent mainstream views within the church.\n\nFor example, in Oxford, a new chaplaincy dedicated to LGBTI+ people and those close to them is due to begin work shortly, a year after the diocese\u2019s four bishops issued an open letter, \u201cClothed with Love\u201d. It said all people were welcome in God\u2019s church, and called for inclusion and respect.\n\nJayne Ozanne, a prominent campaigner for equality within the Church of England and a member of the UK government\u2019s LGBT advisory panel, said she was \u201cdeeply shocked and saddened\u201d by Davies\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cChrist welcomed all \u2013 and we are all called to do the same. To do otherwise is to preach a false Gospel, one that is based on prejudice and fear. The Anglican Communion has committed itself to walking together despite our differences \u2013 Dr Davies would do well to try walking in a young LGBT person\u2019s shoes, and recognise the blatant homophobia inherent in his remarks.\u201d\n\nDavies\u2019 statement came after the synod of the diocese of Wangaratta in Victoria agreed to allow blessings of same-sex marriages in September. The decision is being challenged at the church\u2019s appellate tribunal.\n\nNext year the Anglican Church\u2019s general synod will hold a conference alongside its special session where delegates can discuss issues facing the church, including same-sex relationships and marriage, and discuss ways forward.\n\nIn an opinion piece for Nine\u2019s newspapers on Friday evening, Davies sought to clarify his comments, stating his words were directed at bishops of the church, and those who wish to change the doctrine.\n\n\u201cI stand by those words,\u201d he said. \u201cThe words were not directed at members of our congregations, especially those who identify as gay, whether single or married.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that some have misrepresented my words, whether intentionally or unintentionally.\u201d\n\nA report said Davies had received a standing ovation for his comments at the 51st synod of the diocese of Sydney.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Bishop of Liverpool says he regrets that Archbishop Glenn Davies \u2018seems to want to exclude people rather than to engage with them\u2019", "authors": ["Harriet Sherwood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40ec1eefbaacfb596e4c66203f2ab1662344d549/554_102_1171_703/master/1171.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9374d2e19be3d5f05e02efb9fb8b658d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
