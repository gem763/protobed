Mr Fitzgibbon told Sky News on Wednesday he encourages a \u201cwar cabinet\u201d as an initiative to deal with the \u201cnational emergency\u201d gripping Australian farmers. \u201cWe now know that not one cent of the $5 billion future drought fund will go to farmers\u201d, and Scott Morrison is \u201cbeing loose with the truth,\u201d he said. The Shadow Agricultural Minister said Labor needs to \u201cput pressure on the government to act,\u201d without being accused of politicising the devastating drought crisis.
