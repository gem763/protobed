Because if you do, I believe you will be impeached,\" Kelly recalled, in an interview at the Washington Examiner's political conference Sea Island Summit.\n\nThe House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump less than a year after Kelly departed the administration after a whistleblower report surfaced detailing Trump's handling of a call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump's behavior has only gotten more erratic since.\n\n\"That was almost 11 months ago, and I have an awful lot of, to say the least, second thoughts about leaving,\" Kelly said. \"It pains me to see what's going on because I believe if I was still there or someone like me was there, he would not be kind of, all over the place.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Kelly did not endorse the impeachment inquiry, which he called avoidable, but did indicate that Administration officials are partially responsible.\n\n\"Someone has got to be a guide that tells [the president] that you either have the authority or you don't, or Mr. President, don't do it,\" Kelly said. \"Don't hire someone that will just nod and say, 'That's a great idea Mr. President.' Because you will be impeached.\"", "description": "Kelly said that he warned Trump hiring a 'yes man' would only lead to impeachment, according to the Washington Examiner report.", "authors": ["Megan Hernbroth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5bbfeb768053836128528be2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
