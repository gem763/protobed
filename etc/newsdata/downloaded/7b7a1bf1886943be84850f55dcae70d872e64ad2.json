Among those he kicked out were senior members of parliament, including Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, and Ken Clarke, the longest serving member of Parliament. Some were notified of their firing via text message.\n\n\"This short sighted culling of my colleagues has stripped the Party of broad-minded and dedicated Conservative MPs. I cannot support this act of political vandalism,\" Rudd said.\n\nRudd's announcement follows a tumultuous week in parliament over Johnson's Brexit strategy. The controversial plan pushed Johnson's own brother, Jo Johnson, to step down from parliament, saying he was \"torn between family loyalty and the national interest.\" Johnson's Conservative Party also lost MP Phillip Lee, who defected to join the Liberal Democrats. By the end of the week, Johnson had lost his parliamentary majority.\n\nRudd has been a member of Parliament since 2010. She represents Hastings and Rye, and voted to remain in the E.U. in the 2016 referendum.\n\nHer denunciations of Johnson's Brexit strategy echoed the criticisms voiced by members of the opposition Labour Party, and even many members of the Conservatives.\n\nRudd said she no longer believes \"leaving with a deal is the government's main objective,\" adding, \"The government is expending a lot of energy to prepare for 'No Deal' but I have not seen the same level of intensity go into our talks with the European Union who have asked us to present alternatives to the Irish backstop.\"\n\nLast week, the Parliament passed a bill that prevents Britain from leaving the E.U. without a deal. Queen Elizabeth is expected to approve the measure on Monday.\n\nIn response, Johnson is calling for snap elections on October 15th to try and form a majority in Parliament to support his plans to meet the Brexit deadline. Opposition parties oppose his bid for new elections, and say they will veto it.", "description": "Amber Rudd accused the British prime minister of an \"assault on decency and democracy\" over his plan to exit the European Union with or without a deal.", "authors": ["Shannon Van Sant"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/08/ap_19071324577279_wide-4993a6cb300c083bcfdf8bf8a05345d5c388aadc.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
