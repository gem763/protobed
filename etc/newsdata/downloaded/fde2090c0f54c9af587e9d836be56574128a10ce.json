This week, the magazine came under scrutiny for its white cover model and a corresponding article on black models.\n\n\u201cIn our current issue we approach the color black from different angles,\u201d read a statement provided to Yahoo Lifestyle from ELLE Germany editor-in-chief Sabine Nedelchev. \u201cOne of our focuses was to feature strong black women who work as fashion models. In doing so, we were guilty of several errors for which we sincerely apologize. It was wrong to use the cover line \u2018Back to black\u2019 which could be misconstrued to mean that black individuals are some sort of fashion trend. This obviously was not our intention and we regret not being more sensitive to the possible misinterpretations.\u201d\n\nThe magazine wrote, \u201cMisidentifying the model Naomi Chin Wing as Janaye Furman is a further error for which we apologize. We are aware of how problematic this is. This has definitely been a learning experience for us and, again, we deeply regret any harm or hurt we have unwittingly caused.\u201d\n\nThe fashion Instagram account Diet Prada first flagged problems with the November issue: \u201cNot a good look, ELLE Germany. For their November 2019 issue, the presumably white-led publication declares that \u2018black is back.\u2019 Ironic when they, along with much of the fashion industry, have been complicit in denying visibility to black models until relatively recently.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and apparently they can\u2019t actually tell models apart,\u201d read the Instagram caption. \u201cIn the bottom middle, a picture of Naomi Chin Wing is used in place of Janaye Furman.\u201d Diet Prada also pointed out that Victoria\u2019s Secret model Joan Smalls was positioned as making a comeback. \u201cSmalls has been around for a minute/hasn\u2019t gone anywhere lmao,\u201d wrote Diet Prada.\n\nAnd the last indignity: \u201cThe issue, titled \u2018Back to Black,\u2019 also features a white model on the cover. You can\u2019t make this stuff up!\u201d\n\nReaders took to the comments section of the post to express their disappointment.\n\nPlus-size model and body positivity activist Tess Holiday wrote, \u201cWould say I\u2019m shocked.... but.....\u201d\n\n\"This is what happens when companies who 'want' to be diverse try to speak on diversity and have no diversity in their offices ....\" one person added.\n\n\u201cBlack is back? When did it leave?\u201d another wrote.\n\nNaomi Campbell, who has talked about racism and tokenism in the fashion industry, even tagged veteran black model Iman and Bethann Hardison, a former model turned industry activist, in a post on Instagram Tuesday.\n\nIn the caption, she wrote, \u201cThis makes me so sad to see this, @bethannhardison @the_real_iman and I are here if you are not clear on the guidelines of diversity...your mistake it is highly insulting in every way...you go further to say that BACK TO BLACK, even if you meant the fashion, it\u2019s misleading on your headline and Type!!\u201d\n\nCampbell added, \u201cI\u2019ve said countless of times we are not a TREND. We are here to STAY. It\u2019s ok to celebrate models of color but please do it in an ELEGANT and RESPECTFUL way.\u201d The legendary beauty wrote that she also has been mistakenly identified as other models of color. Demanding cultural sensitivity, Campbell wrote in part, \u201cIt\u2019s very important for a publication to be culturally sensitive and give credit where it\u2019s due. We all need to unite on this matter.\u201d\n\nHardison addressed ELLE Germany on Campbell\u2019s post, \u201c...Your staff should stay away from trying to be topical and speak of models of color. You are limited in your scope. You are far away and not really aware of how to fit into the evolution of change and it ebb and flow of an industry. A weak industry always will need strong intelligent clarity. This seems to elude you and your magazine. Please leave stories of our successes out of your magazine as you know little of it. We don\u2019t need your support, it\u2019s damaging. It\u2019s clear it was not in support but an attempt to be topical and poorly. Hopefully you are embarrassed by our reactions.\u201d\n\nAnd Ivan Bart, the president of IMG Models which represents Smalls and Chin Wing wrote, \u201cThank you, @Naomi. The whole thing is insane from misrepresenting @naomichinwing to putting a white woman on the cover of \u2018Back to Black.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Furman responded with a wordless Instagram video in which she calmly drinks tea. \u201c#BlackIsBack\u201d she wrote.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "ELLE Germany apologized for confusing one black mode for another in its \"Back to Black\" November 2019 issue.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D0KQRU_3MsrjcnbsnT7HQg--~B/aD03ODI7dz01ODI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/5d5e4f80-fb2e-11e9-bfee-53848b07355d", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
