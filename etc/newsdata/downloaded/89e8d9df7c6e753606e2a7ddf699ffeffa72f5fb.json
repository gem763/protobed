As Jimenez and the 600 kg (1,300 lb) bull begin to circle around the cape, the crowd cheer every pass with cries of \"Ole! Ole!\". In his embroidered gold and white \"traje de luces\" or \"suit of lights,\" the matador dodges the horns again and again.\n\nSpanish picadores Francisco Romero (left), 26, and Agustin Romero, 25, pose for a portrait. Jimenez is only 25 but has already been fighting bulls since he was 15, not long after he and his brother Borja, also a matador, began taking a red cape into school in Espartinas, near Seville, to show off their feints and pirouettes. Now in his seventh year fighting at the Real Maestranza arena in the Spanish city of Seville, Jimenez says he still feels the same fear he did the first time he knelt in the sand to await the bull charging out of the gate.\n\nSpanish assistant bullfighter Manuel Rodriguez \"Mambru\" waits the start of a bullfight. \"I asked a matador who had spent 50 years in the ring -- and he still feels the same now as he did the first time.\"\n\nSpanish matador Lopez Simon is seen after killing a bull. The Real Maestranza is packed for this fight, part of Seville's April Fair, a celebration of all things Andalusian filled with Flamenco dancing and copious drinking of locally produced Manzanilla sherry. But elsewhere, audiences for a tradition that goes back over a thousand years are dwindling, as new generations shun what they see as a cruel and unfair contest.\n\n1 / 11 Slideshow Spanish matador Lopez Simon stands during a bullfight.
