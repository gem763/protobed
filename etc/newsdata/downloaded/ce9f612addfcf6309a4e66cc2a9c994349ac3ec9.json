MailOnline has contacted a spokesman for comment.\n\nPrince Harry (pictured with wife Meghan yesterday on the final day of their Africa tour in Johannesburg) ignored the advice of some of his most senior aides before publishing an extraordinary statement attacking the British press, it has been claimed\n\nThere are also claims Harry did not inform his father Prince Charles (pictured in Arnhem on September 21) beforehand\n\nThe statement was published on a new 'Sussex' website created specifically for it on Tuesday.\n\nThe newspaper claims a separate website and different legal team from the one usually used by the royals were employed on purpose to distance Harry's team from his message.\n\nSources also claim his brother William (pictured on June 6) only found out when the statement was published\n\nIt comes after the royal couple announced Meghan has decided to take legal action against the Mail on Sunday after publication of a letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle.\n\nHis statement read: 'Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences \u2013 a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.\n\n'There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face \u2013 as so many of you can relate to \u2013 I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.\n\n'Because in today's digital age, press fabrications are repurposed as truth across the globe. One day's coverage is no longer tomorrow's chip-paper.'\n\nLaw firm Schillings is representing the Duchess, instead of the royal firm of choice Harbottle & Lewis, who have recently worked on cases for both Harry and William.\n\nThe timing of the announcement, which has been branded 'unfortunate' by royal aides, is believed to be in line with legal advice from Schillings.\n\nExperts say they advised Harry to publish before the tour ended for 'maximum impact'.\n\nA royal source told The Sun: 'This is not the done thing on a royal tour, when the principals are representing the Queen and country. I can't imagine the Queen will be very impressed.'\n\nHarry and Meghan are pictured on the final day of their Africa tour in Johannesburg\n\nThe legal proceedings in the Chancery Division of the High Court are being privately funded by Harry and Meghan.\n\nHis statement ended: 'My deepest fear is history repeating itself. I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.\n\n'I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.'\n\nDepending on the court ruling, proceeds from any damages will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.\n\nA spokesman for the Mail on Sunday said: 'The Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.'", "description": "Royal sources claim Harry was warned not to publish the statement while he and Meghan were still on their taxpayer-funded tour of Africa.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/00/19231808-0-image-a-77_1570060351121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
