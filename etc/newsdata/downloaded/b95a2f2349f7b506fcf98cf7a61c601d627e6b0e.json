Benett/Dave Benett/WireImage)\n\nAngelina Jolie has opened up on the important role men can play in shaping young girls.\n\nThe Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil actress talked about how stories \u2013 whether it be in novels or movies \u2013 usually have female characters rely on men to become strong.\n\n\u2018I think that, so often, when a story\u2019s told which says \u201cthis is a strong woman\u201d, she has to beat the man, or she has to be like the man, or she has to somehow not need the man,\u2019 Angelina said last week at a press conference for the Disney film.\n\nThe 44-year-old believes young girls need to \u2018find their own power\u2019 without having to rely on men.\n\nReferring to her own character Maleficent and Princess Aurora, who is portrayed by Elle Fanning, Angelina said: \u2018We both very much need and love and learn from the men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And so I think that\u2019s also an important message for young girls, to find their own power, but to respect and learn from the men around them.\u2019\n\nMistress of Evil is the sequel to 2014\u2019s highly successful Maleficent and stars Ed Skrein, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nThe actress plays a powerful fairy and protector of the moors (Picture: Disney Enterprises Inc)\n\n\u2018We have strong women, but the character that is wrong in the film and has to be taken out is also a woman,\u2019 the actress added. \u2018We show very diverse types of women, between our characters, but also we have extraordinary men in the film, and I really want to press that point.\u2019\n\nAt the same time, Elle agreed with Angelina and added that Princess Aurora\u2019s strength isn\u2019t in her physical form like in most children\u2019s movies.\n\nThe 21-year-old said: \u2018Aurora\u2019s strength is her kindness, and she stays very true to herself, which is something I wanted to keep in the film.\n\n\u2018She is soft and feminine and wants to be a wife and have babies, and that\u2019s a beautiful, strong thing that isn\u2019t portrayed a lot on screen.\u2019\n\nFair point, Elle.\n\n\u2018A lot of the princesses are like, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna make her a strong princess! And make her tough, so we\u2019re gonna make her fight!\u201d And it\u2019s like, is that what being a strong woman means?\u2019 the Neon Demon actress added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Like, we just have to have a sword and have armour on and go fight? Aurora can do that in a different way, in a pink dress, and it\u2019s beautiful that she keeps her softness and vulnerabilities.\u2019\n\nLouder for the people in the back!\n\nGot a showbiz story?
