Bloomberg reported that Banana Republic stocks up to size 16 in stores and up to size 20 online for some articles of clothing, but that the company would like to boost its selection up to size 26 or larger.\n\n\"The industry is overdue to really embrace the communities in a representative way that we all do business in,\" Peck told Bloomberg.\n\nRead more: We visited Banana Republic and J.Crew to see which was a better store, and the winner was clear\n\nA Gap representative did not return Business Insider's request for further comment on Peck's statements.\n\nGap acquired the chain in 1983, just five years after the apparel brand's founding. Banana Republic started out as a safari-themed clothing retailer, according to AdWeek, but Gap tweaked the brand to become more upscale and preppy.\n\nPeck's comments come after a series of slips on the part of Banana Republic. In the second quarter of 2019, Banana Republic saw a comparable sales slump of 3%. Gap is shutting down all remaining Banana Republic stores in the United Kingdom, according to the Guardian.\n\nGap Inc. also announced in February that it would be spinning off Old Navy.\n\nOf Gap's various brands, Peck told Bloomberg that he wanted Banana Republic in particular to start \"inviting a customer that hasn't probably shopped at that brand to come in.\"", "description": "Gap first acquired the chain in 1983, just five years after the apparel brand's founding.
