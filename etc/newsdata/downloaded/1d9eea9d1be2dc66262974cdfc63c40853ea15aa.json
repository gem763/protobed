Photo: Alexander Koerner/Getty Images\n\nIn the weeks since Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on sex-trafficking charges back in July, questions have resurfaced about the late financier and accused pedophile\u2019s relationship with Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s son. One of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims, Virginia Giuffre, says that Epstein forced her to have sex with the prince on three occasions while she was underage. Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace have repeatedly denied the allegations against him, even as more documentation of his friendship with Epstein continues to pile up, including a video of him at Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side mansion, and an account from someone who claimed to have seen him getting a foot massage there from young women.\n\nThe palace, it appears, is finally taking the accusations seriously. Or, at least the \u201coptics\u201d of them. According to the Daily Mail, the prince returned home early from a golf vacation in Spain this week to take part in \u201ccrisis talks\u201d regarding another damning picture of him that has recently emerged. It shows him at a party hosted by Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, where Epstein was in attendance as well. The prince also apparently realized that it wouldn\u2019t look good for pictures of him enjoying a Spanish golf vacation to come out while he\u2019s being accused of having sex with underage girls. As a source told the Sun this week, \u201cThe optics were not a good look, with so many stories about the Epstein accusers while he was on a sunny golf course in Spain. He\u2019s having a series of talks with advisers this week about how to salvage his reputation going forward.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, Melania Trump, Prince Andrew.

For example, a source \u201cclose to the prince\u201d suggested to the Telegraph this week that a widely circulated picture from 2001 that shows the prince with his hand around the waist of a 17-year-old Giuffre, with Epstein\u2019s alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, in the background, was in fact doctored. His explanation: In real life, the prince\u2019s fingers are \u201cmuch chubbier\u201d than the ones in the photo.\n\n\u201cAndrew\u2019s fingers appear quite slender, like a girl\u2019s fingers,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey are also a strange shade of red. His real fingers are actually much chubbier, quite small and chubby.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell.

The prince, she said, \u201cknows exactly what he\u2019s done, and I hope he comes clean about it.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
