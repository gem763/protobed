In the United States, Oyo is rebranding the Hooters Casino Hotel in Las Vegas as its own.\n\nAgarwal has said India and China account for two-thirds of the company's total revenue, while a fifth comes from Europe and the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, as the company pushes for profits, many hotel owners who partnered with it complained of their income being hurt by higher fees Oyo charges them.", "description": "SoftBank-backed Oyo to raise $1.5 billion led by founder, existing investors", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF960I5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
