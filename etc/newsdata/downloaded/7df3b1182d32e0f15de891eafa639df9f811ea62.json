It was reported that he spoke about the virtues of blockchain and how it should be used to boost China's economic security during a meeting with the Politburo Committee yesterday.\n\nLitecoin has been on the way down in recent months since it peaked at $145 in June. But its price is now nearly double what it was at the start of the year, when it was at $31.\n\nIn Litecoin news, founder Charlie Lee unveiled a proposal, earlier this week, to bring privacy features to the coin. But there have been some concerns considering that crypto exchanges have been dropping privacy coins in recent weeks\u2014and that, if Litecoin were to add privacy features, the same could happen.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Litecoin has suddenly surged today as the crypto market spikes on China President Xi Jinping's endorsement of blockchain.", "authors": ["Nawaz Sulemanji"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PcsRFXfAUCh5pTlJ2qmYLQ--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/fad8c5839ffd232d59a4af4484083636", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
