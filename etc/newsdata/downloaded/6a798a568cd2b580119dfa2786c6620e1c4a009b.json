As I said before the MK Dons game, with youth development, with these moments when they are in between the U23s and the first team, consistency is very important.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cHe had a good game and he is preparing for another one. It will be special for him playing at Anfield.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mohamed Salah is fit to face Arsenal despite limping off in the final stages of Sunday\u2019s win against Tottenham.\n\nThe Egyptian was back in training on Monday and has been cleared to feature when the Gunners visit Anfield.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cMo is fine,\u201d said Lijnders.\n\n\u201cTowards the end of the game it is more precaution because the ankle gets more tired and he feels it a little bit more and we have to take him off. But he is fine, he is good.\n\n\u201cAll the others are fit, hungry and ready to go.\u201d", "description": "The Reds will turn to their third-choice goalkeeper against Arsenal despite Alisson's return from injury dumping Adrian back to his No.2 role", "authors": ["Alex Harris", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20157882.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Liverpool-v-Arsenal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
