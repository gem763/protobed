Garrett had two roughing the passer penalties on Monday night, and one of them ended New York Jets quarterback Trevor Siemian\u2019s season.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nGarrett said he\u2019s not a dirty player though.\n\n\u201cI know who I am, and the guys within these walls who I am. That\u2019s not me,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything to try to hurt this team or try to take out any player outside of the rulebook.\u201d\n\nMyles Garrett says he\u2019s not dirty\n\nGarrett\u2019s hit on Siemian was similar to others that were called around the NFL on Sunday.\n\nDefenders can\u2019t land with their full weight on the quarterback. Garrett did that, and he said officials told him he also hit Siemian too high.\n\nGarrett didn\u2019t mean to injure Siemian, but when he landed on him, the quarterback\u2019s left foot was pinned underneath him in an awkward way. Siemian needs season-ending ankle surgery.\n\nFirst of all, I want to wish @TrevorSiemian a speedy recovery. We put our bodies on the line every single snap, and I wouldn\u2019t wish an injury on anyone.\n\nOther than that, great team win but we still have a lot of work to do. So much love to all the fans, onto next week\ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffe \u2014 Myles \"Flash\" Garrett \u26a1\ufe0f (@MylesLGarrett) September 17, 2019\n\nGarrett said he would never try to injure another player.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to do anything dirty. I\u2019m not trying to injure anybody,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nGarrett vows to play with same aggressiveness\n\nGarrett has the same issue as many defenders around the NFL. They\u2019re taught to play the game a certain way. And in many ways, they\u2019re being held to an impossible standard when it comes to tackling but doing so without breaking any of the many rules to protect offensive players.\n\n\u201cYou want to play aggressive, you want to play passionate,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cYou just want to finish the play. I\u2019m going to keep on playing with that same aggressiveness, I\u2019ve just going to be smarter. Better in the strike zone and trying to pull off so I don\u2019t land on him with all my weight.\u201d\n\nGarrett had a huge night against the Jets. He had three sacks and looked unblockable. He\u2019ll be a candidate for NFL defensive player of the year if he keeps that up.\n\nHe might draw some extra attention from officials, too.\n\nTrevor Siemian of the New York Jets was hurt on this play after he was tackled by Myles Garrett.
