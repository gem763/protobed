REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has formed a panel to review electoral boundaries, the government said on Wednesday, the traditional precursor to an election being called within months.\n\nLee\u2019s People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) is all but certain of a healthy victory with even the main opposition downbeat on its chances. But the PAP, which has comfortably won every election since Singapore\u2019s independence in 1965, will want to ensure its large majority isn\u2019t eroded.\n\nAnalysts say the PAP may hold the vote shortly after delivering a budget in February that would likely boost spending to help the public as the city state\u2019s trade-dependent economy teeters on the edge of recession.\n\nIf the economy worsens further then the vote could come sooner, they said.\n\n\u201cThe Singapore economy is one of the weakest now in the Asia Pacific region and it makes sense because it is a small, open economy, highly exposed to trade,\u201d said Moody\u2019s Analytics economist Steve Cochrane.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an obvious time that the government would be instituting some expansionary spending, something to boost the economy, get it through this weak point,\u201d Cochrane added.\n\nFinance Minister Heng Swee Keat, who is widely expected to takeover from Lee as prime minister after the election, could raise his profile by delivering a bumper budget.\n\nHeng may offer help on education, housing, jobs and the elderly, all important issues for voters, analysts said.\n\nGillian Koh, deputy director of research at the Institute of Public Policy Studies, said the next budget would likely include more subsidies for childcare, pre-school education and for training and re-skilling workers.\n\n\u201cAnd anything to do with dealing with costs for the senior segment of society,\u201d she said.\n\nLACK OF OPPOSITION\n\nWhile a looming recession would cause many governments to steer away from calling an election, the PAP could actually benefit from the downturn as it is viewed by some members of the public as the only party able to properly manage the economy.\n\n\u201cSo long as the PAP government is not regarded as having mismanaged the economy, a slowing economy is likely to be advantageous,\u201d law professor and a former nominated member of parliament, Eugene Tan, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe current reserves can give a significant boost to government spending in next year\u2019s budget and that can be politically advantageous and strategic for the PAP.\u201d\n\nFor many voters, some extra support to bring down costs in a struggling economy would be welcome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been more and more difficult for many young people to get housing, and many middle incomers like myself find ourselves in a hard situation,\u201d said 29-year-old banker Alicia Tang.\n\nIn the last election, in 2015, the PAP won about 69.9 percent of the vote, an improvement on its worst ever showing of 60.1 percent in 2011.\n\nOpponents say the political structure heavily favours the PAP and makes it difficult to pose a credible challenge. The PAP denies the voting system is biased and says it promotes contestable elections.\n\nThe Workers Party, the only opposition party in parliament, with six of 89 elected seats, is close to \u201cwipe out\u201d, its leader Pritam Singh has said.\n\nSome voters want to see a credible opposition.\n\n\u201cNext elections, I hope the opposition will have some representation,\u201d Tang said.\n\n\u201cBut right now, we don\u2019t have quality opposition.\u201d", "description": "Singapore is expected to roll out a generous budget ahead of an election as the ruling party seeks to appease voters who are feeling the pinch from a sharp economic downturn, analysts say.", "authors": ["Fathin Ungku", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426842394&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850QM", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
