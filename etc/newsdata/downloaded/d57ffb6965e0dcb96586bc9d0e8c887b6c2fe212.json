Construction begins next year and will finish by 2024.\n\n\"We are doing research into this project and it will soon be put into practice,\" said Liu Hua, head of the National Nuclear Safety Administration, during a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe site was selected in Gansu because it presents ideal conditions to prevent leaks: there is no seismic activity nearby and the bedrock the lab will be housed in is made of granite, which reduces the risk of groundwater seepage or fractures, according to a paper published in The Journal of Rock Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering last year.\n\nConstruction begins next year, with the facility expected to be completed by 2024. Research will be carried out until 2040 -- and if the results are positive, a long-term storage facility will be built.\n\nRead More", "description": "China will soon start construction on an facility 560 meters underground in Gansu province.
