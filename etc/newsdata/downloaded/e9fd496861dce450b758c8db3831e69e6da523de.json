He is 12 months into a three-year farewell tour that has sold out arenas and sports stadiums around the world, and earned some of the most rapturous reviews of his 50-year career. \u201cThe last time I had notices like this I had a full head of hair and the writer had to spend half the review explaining who I was,\u201d is how he puts it. His musical biopic Rocketman has grossed nearly $200m at the box office. And he\u2019s about to publish his autobiography, Me.\n\nFull disclosure: I spent three and half years working with John on the book. I was both delighted and impossibly flattered to be asked, but work on it got off to a deeply peculiar start. The first interviews took place on the set of Kingsman: The Golden Circle, in which he had a cameo role that involved wearing one of his old stage costumes. Thus, I enjoyed the disconcerting experience of interviewing Elton John while he was dressed as Elton John in 1974: an outfit entirely made up of multicoloured marabou feathers, a headdress covered in jewels and mirrored glass, and a pair of silver platform boots with ELTON written on them in giant red letters. \u201cOf course I can walk in them,\u201d he frowned, when I mentioned the latter. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve jumped off pianos in bigger platforms than these. It\u2019s like riding a bike \u2013 you don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\nBut however mind-boggling he looked, it was nothing compared with what came out of his mouth: a succession of stories about his life in 1975 \u2013 when he was both the biggest pop star in the world and horribly depressed \u2013 so lurid that I assumed they\u2019d never make it past the first draft. But they all ended up in the book. No spoilers, but put it this way: you\u2019ll never look at a snooker table in the same way again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arriving for the screening of Rocketman at the Cannes film festival earlier this year. Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt set the tone for how things were going to be. I\u2019d travel to wherever he was, he\u2019d talk about his past with startling candour, hooting with laughter at the awfulness of his behaviour or the sheer preposterousness of his own success: \u201cMe and Bernie [Taupin, his longtime collaborator] used to look at each other all the time, utterly baffled, like, \u2018What the fuck is happening to us now?\u2019\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always tried to be honest. I didn\u2019t hide my sexuality \u2013 as soon as I realised I was gay, I told everyone\n\nThere are lots of reasons why Elton John has earned national treasure status, most obviously his ability to write songs that have become part of the fabric of life, but high on the list is that it\u2019s hard to think of another member of the rock aristocracy blessed with such a self-deprecating sense of humour, or such a keen sense that, from the moment he set foot on stage at the LA Troubadour in 1970 \u2013 a gig that transformed him into a star \u2013 his life has been completely ridiculous. He talked a lot about the danger of losing touch with who he really was \u2013 a gifted but shy, music-obsessed boy from a council house in Pinner. But listening to him, that was what he sounded like: someone who, for all his talent, couldn\u2019t quite believe the way it had all turned out.\n\nToday I ask him the questions we have been sent, and he is charmingly, fan-ishly delighted that one is from Bob Dylan (Dylan stopping him and Taupin on the stairs of a New York venue and telling them he liked their songs was one of the pair\u2019s first \u201cWhat the hell is happening to us?\u201d moments). He dissolves into laughter recalling the late Freddie Mercury\u2019s way with words, or John Lennon\u2019s attempts to come up with his own drag name. And he is admirably unfazed by the tone-lowering line of inquiry pursued by rapper Eminem: once again, no subject seems is off limits.\n\nWhen a tour ends I have a huge void of time to fill. What are you going to do when this big tour is over?\n\nEd Sheeran, singer-songwriter\n\nI don\u2019t have a clue. I\u2019ve got another couple of years to go. What I\u2019d like to do is spend time at my house in Windsor, walk around the garden, catch up with friends, spend some time with the boys [his sons Zachary and Elijah]. I just want to do nothing for about six months and catch up with my social life in England. Whether I\u2019ll be able to do that is another matter \u2013 I\u2019m not going to miss travelling, or life on the road, or staying in hotels, but I\u2019m an enormous fidget. When I got sick a couple of years back, I was forced to spend seven weeks at home in Windsor, recuperating. It was the longest time I\u2019d spent there in years, and I really enjoyed it: seeing the boys when they got in from school, hearing their news. I remember when I came out of rehab, there\u2019s this thing they talk about called \u201cthe hole in the doughnut\u201d: how are you going to fill the time you used to spend drinking and taking drugs? I had all these extravagant ideas about learning to speak Italian and how to cook, and of course I never did any of them. So I\u2019m not planning on anything like that. I\u2019d just like to take it easy and enjoy the fruits of spending three and a half years on the road.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest At the Dodger Stadium, LA, in 1975. Photograph: Terry O\u2019Neill/Iconic Images/Getty Images\n\nIn the song Tiny Dancer, did you work your way up to the cathartic chorus gradually, spontaneously, or did you have it thought out from the start?\n\nBob Dylan, singer-songwriter\n\nThis is a very good question. Tiny Dancer has a really long lyric, a very cinematic, California-in-the-early-70s lyric, so it had two verses and a middle eight before it even gets to the chorus, and it lent itself to a long buildup. The middle eight sets it up well, then it slows down for a moment \u2013 \u201cwhen I say softly, slowly\u2026\u201d That line suggested a big chorus. I don\u2019t remember much about writing it, but I do remember trying to make it sound as Californian as possible. Writing a song like that\u2019s a bit like having a wank, really. You want the climax to be good, but you don\u2019t want it to be over too quickly \u2013 you want to work your way up to it. Bernie\u2019s lyric took such a long time to get to the chorus, I thought, \u201cFuck, the chorus had better be something special when it finally arrives.\u201d And it\u2019s \u201chere I come\u201d, literally.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tiny Dancer: \u2018I do remember trying to make it sound as Californian as possible.\u2019\n\nHave you used your wedding gift yet?\n\nEminem, rapper\n\nAh, no. Eminem bought me and David matching cock rings when we got married. That was his gift. They sit there, like the crown jewels, in this beautiful box on satin cushions. They\u2019re wonderful to look at. I don\u2019t know if any guests we\u2019ve had have used them. God, I hope not. They\u2019re kind of sacrosanct. The fact they came from Eminem makes it even better. It\u2019s very him, as is this question. I call him up every couple of months, and every time he picks up the phone he says the same thing: \u201cHello, you old cunt, how are you?\u201d Justin Timberlake says the same thing, actually.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With husband David Furnish at the Ritz, 2001. Photograph: Richard Young/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nOver the years, you and I have talked about the need for a new \u2018championship\u2019 song that can become a sports anthem. How\u2019s it going?\n\nBillie Jean King, tennis champion and founder of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative\n\nBillie Jean has always gone on about We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions by Queen being the ultimate sports songs. I couldn\u2019t ask Bernie to sit down and write a lyric like that \u2013 he\u2019s not that kind of writer. We wrote Philadelphia Freedom for Billie Jean\u2019s tennis team, the Philadelphia Freedoms, but it\u2019s not really about tennis; Bernie just wrote about Philadelphia. And to be honest, We Are The Champions can\u2019t be beaten: it\u2019s so good at what it does, any sport can use it. Queen had that market sewn up, which was hysterical, because Freddie Mercury hated sport; he knew nothing about it at all. If you\u2019d mentioned Arsenal to Freddie, he\u2019d have thought it was something to do with gay sex.\n\nYour path to success hasn\u2019t always been easy. You weren\u2019t born into privilege and you\u2019ve had to battle other people\u2019s preconceptions in many aspects of your life. How have you overcome these challenges, and what drives you when things seem difficult?\n\nLewis Hamilton, Formula One champion\n\nThe challenges I had were shyness and my sexuality. I\u2019ve always tried to be honest. I didn\u2019t hide my sexuality from myself or people around me \u2013 as soon as I realised I was gay, I told everyone I knew; it didn\u2019t give me a hang-up. Shyness never really held me back \u2013 a lot of creative people are shy and pull themselves out of that on stage. It\u2019s when you come off stage and you\u2019re stuck with yourself again that the problems start. I found challenges hard to overcome until I got sober, because I didn\u2019t know how to deal with them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In 1975. Photograph: Charles Knight/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nBeing sober is all about asking for help to get through challenges. You can\u2019t just barrel through and do things yourself \u2013 you have to reach out. It took me a long time to get where I am now: I was too trusting, I didn\u2019t like confrontations, so I made bad decisions, especially in business. The fear of confrontation went back to my childhood, my parents rowing all the time, and it really held me back. It became less and less when I got sober, but it\u2019s still there. It doesn\u2019t magically disappear.\n\nWhich song from the last five years do you wish you had written?\n\nCharli XCX, singer-songwriter\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have minded writing Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road, but I think The Joke by Brandi Carlile. I just love it, I\u2019ve played it continuously. It\u2019s just the kind of song I could have written, quite Elton-ish. It\u2019s the song that launched her into the stratosphere after seven albums \u2013 it was nominated for four Grammys. She\u2019s a friend, I love her and people are now giving her the respect she deserves.\n\nOut of everyone you\u2019ve worked with, who is the most annoying?\n\nFat Tony, DJ\n\nWell, he wasn\u2019t annoying, but I was perplexed when I went to work with Timbaland, the hip-hop producer. I did a track for him in Las Vegas for his Shock Value album. I loved his work, so I went to the studio, said hello and just sat at the piano and wrote this song. He\u2019s obviously quite shy, and while I was writing it, he didn\u2019t really communicate with me. He was making beats with some other guy. I\u2019m there for three or four hours, trying to write something really good, and all I was hearing in my headphones was him messing around with beats, no feedback at all. He didn\u2019t tell me he liked it, didn\u2019t tell me he didn\u2019t like it. It was confusing; I was convinced I was doing something wrong. When I left, he just said, \u201cSee you again\u201d, and I thought, \u201cWell, maybe you won\u2019t\u201d: I was crestfallen, a bit angry.\n\nAnyway, the next day he rang up and said: \u201cHey man, it\u2019s fucking genius. I love you, sorry if I didn\u2019t communicate, I\u2019m really shy.\u201d And the track turned out brilliantly. It\u2019s called Two Man Show. The funny thing is, the finished song\u2019s got him going \u201cI like that\u2026 yeah\u2026 don\u2019t it sound good to you, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d over my piano part. So it was fine in the end. I still love him to death.\n\nIf you could be one woman alive and one woman from the past, who would you be?\n\nCara Delevingne, model and actor\n\nFrom the past, I would love to have been Elizabeth Taylor, because (a) she was fucking talented and brilliant, (b) she was beautiful, (c) she had a lot of sex, and (d) she had the most fantastic jewellery. And she became one of the world\u2019s greatest philanthropists. I mean, it\u2019s a very easy choice. She was a very dear friend of mine. She had an absolutely filthy sense of humour, very British. It\u2019s hard to pick someone from today, because there are so many candidates, but I think I\u2019d choose Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand. She\u2019s one of the few politicians that I respect and love \u2013 she\u2019s got dignity and she\u2019s humane. I think she\u2019s doing a brilliant job.\n\nYou like to obsessively collect different kinds of objects \u2013 art, photography, jewellery. Where did this obsession start?\n\nAlessandro Michele, Gucci designer\n\nIt started when I was a kid. My mum and dad would be shouting at each other, or shouting at me, and I\u2019d run to my room, where I had my records, my toys, my books. They were like my best friends \u2013 they didn\u2019t shout at me. I kept them in pristine condition \u2013 I started really valuing objects. Then when I first started making money, I collected art nouveau and art deco. And I\u2019m capable of getting rid of stuff. Just before I got sober, I sold everything. But I didn\u2019t stop collecting, I just started collecting different things. Photography, obviously, but also napkin rings, china and tablewear, which Gianni Versace got me into. The real gay me came out when I was sober!\n\nI\u2019d love to be a minimalist, but I just have to accept what I am. I\u2019m a magpie. You learn about things by collecting \u2013 you buy things, you read up about them, you learn. I mean, I could write a book about napkin rings, but I don\u2019t think it would be a very big seller.\n\nWe had the best time on holiday with you and David in the summer; who are your favourite holiday companions of all time, aside from me and David of course?\n\nVictoria Beckham, designer and Spice Girl\n\nTheo Fennell, the jeweller, and his wife Louise. They\u2019ve been my friends for about 35 years and are just the nicest, funniest people. If you have people on holiday with you, you have to have funny people, and Theo is one of the funniest people I know. I\u2019ve never had a dull moment with them in all the time I\u2019ve known them.\n\nIf you were a Spice Girl, which Spice Girl would you be?\n\nSam Smith, singer\n\nObviously Posh. Although, there was a side of me before I got sober that would definitely have been Mel B.\n\nYou saved my life. How many other lives have you saved?\n\nDonatella Versace, designer\n\nI have absolutely no idea. Donatella\u2019s talking about addiction here. I am responsible for helping a lot of people get sober and hopefully to stay sober. That\u2019s your responsibility, and it\u2019s part of the process. You give them your phone number, you take theirs, you make sure you phone them, check up on them, see they\u2019re OK \u2013 that\u2019s what I did with Eminem.\n\nI remember very, very well the night Donatella decided to go for help. It was an intervention, which isn\u2019t always the best way of doing things \u2013 if people aren\u2019t ready for it, it turns into a disaster. With Donatella, I knew she was ready, because she came to see me play a show in Reggio Calabria three weeks beforehand. She was in a terrible state, and I knew she was giving me a message: \u201cI need help, I need this now, I\u2019m at my lowest ebb.\u201d She didn\u2019t take much persuading to go.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With George Michael, Andrew Ridgeley and Bernie Taupin in 1985. Photograph: Silverhub/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nSome people, you try and they just don\u2019t want to know. George Michael was like that. He did go away to Switzerland for a while, but he was too stubborn. It was weird; when he died, Ozzy Osbourne said to me, \u201cYou know what, Elton? I don\u2019t think he wanted to be here any more\u201d, which seems like a harsh thing to say, but I think it was right. He didn\u2019t want to be here. He had a choice, he knew what he had to do and he wouldn\u2019t do it. So there you go.\n\nWhat are your real or imagined top three drag names?\n\nTilda Swinton, actor\n\nI\u2019ve got three drag names. My original drag name, the one I use the most, is Sharon Cavendish. Cavendish came from a keyboard player in the 50s called Kay Cavendish, who was always billed as Kitten On The Keys. My friend Tony King came up with it. When I\u2019m in France, I am R\u00e9gine Pouffe. And when I\u2019m in Atlanta, because I live in an area called Buckhead, I\u2019m Tallulah Buckhead. And I\u2019ve been known to check into hotels as Chlamydia Schiffer, which David came up with. You can\u2019t choose your drag name \u2013 someone has to give it to you. I love giving people drag names. John Lennon wanted to be Morag, but it doesn\u2019t work like that, so he ended up being Carol Dakota. Freddie Mercury was Melina, after [Greek actor, singer and politician] Melina Mercouri. Rod Stewart\u2019s Phyllis.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A 1973 outfit. Photograph: Terry O\u2019Neill/Iconic Images/Getty Images\n\nThe world lost an incredible artist to HIV when Freddie Mercury died. Can you share your favourite memory of him?\n\nPeter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria\n\nBackstage at Live Aid, I had a huge area that I kind of decorated. I made sure there were seats for everyone, so that people who were playing could sit down and have a natter. Freddie came over after Queen had stolen the show. I said, \u201cFreddie, nobody should go on after you \u2013 you were magnificent.\u201d He said: \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right, darling, we were \u2013 we killed them.\u201d He was so excited. Then he said, \u201cYou, on the other hand, dear \u2013 you looked like the fucking Queen Mother when you were on stage. Where did you get that absolutely awful hat?\u201d That was very Freddie. He was hilarious. Even when he was dying, he was exactly the same. He was lying in bed, too weak to stand, losing his sight, going: \u201cHave you heard Mrs Bowie\u2019s new album, darling? What does she think she\u2019s doing?\u201d I always had the best time with him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Freddie Mercury in 1980. Photograph: Richard Young/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nI find you to be one of the best soul singers of all time. Which singers inspired you and helped you find your own voice?\n\nLenny Kravitz, singer\n\nIn the 60s, I was in a band that played soul music \u2013 we started out playing blues and switched to soul. I used to sing My Girl by The Temptations, and we got to play as the backing band for Lee Dorsey, Major Lance, Patti LaBelle and Billy Stewart. I learned a lot just by watching them every night. I never consciously tried to imitate soul singers \u2013 you have to be authentic in what you do. But it\u2019s my favourite type of music, I\u2019ve always loved it. It has the best singers \u2013 Marvin Gaye, Bobby Womack, Levi Stubbs from The Four Tops, the Detroit Spinners, the Stylistics \u2013 and obviously I\u2019ve listened to so much of it, a little bit rubbed off. I\u2019ve had three records at No 1 on the US R&B chart: Bennie And The Jets, Philadelphia Freedom and Mama Can\u2019t Buy You Love, which was incredibly flattering.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Bernie Taupin. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nHave you ever thought about what life would have been like had you been born a girl and grown up in 1950s England. Do you think you would have followed your instincts to make music?\n\nKristin Scott Thomas, actor\n\nIt was very difficult to be a girl in the 50s. I didn\u2019t enjoy the 50s much \u2013 it was all people peering out from behind their net curtains and being judgmental. For a girl, sexuality wasn\u2019t talked about \u2013 if she got pregnant, she was sent away in disgrace. It\u2019s harder for women, period, but especially in the 50s. They were looked upon by boys as sex objects and nothing more \u2013 you know, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get a bit of tit.\u201d I had female friends at school, and I obviously didn\u2019t look at them as a potential bit of tit, but that\u2019s how they were seen.\n\nIf I had the same musical desires, of course I would have tried to follow them, but it would have been so much harder. There were no role models for female musicians at the time \u2013 boys had dozens, but all the female artists were singers; there were no role models for songwriters and musicians. There was Honey Lantree, who played drums in The Honeycombs, and that was it. My dad thought it was disgraceful that I wanted to get involved in rock\u2019n\u2019roll. Can you imagine what it would have been like if I was a girl?\n\nOne of your first gifts to support the fight against Aids was donating your entire vinyl collection to the Terrence Higgins Trust. Are we where you thought we would be in the fight against HIV now \u2013 and have you replaced the collection?\n\nIan Green, chief executive, THT\n\nWell, we have the medicines to stop the disease, which is what we need. We don\u2019t have a vaccine or a cure, but there\u2019s no need for anyone in the world to be affected by this disease any more. They can live a long and healthy life, the same as anyone else, if they get tested and diagnosed early enough. But the traumatic thing is still the stigma. People are afraid of getting tested, because they\u2019re ashamed, or because their families will throw them out. That happens in Africa and eastern Europe, but also in rural America, which is unbelievable in 2019. We can stop the spread of the disease now \u2013 it\u2019s more treatable than diabetes, for Christ\u2019s sake. We need people to get tested, know their status and own their status. We need more role models like [former rugby player] Gareth Thomas to come out and say they\u2019re HIV positive so people are less afraid. That\u2019s where we stand. And have I replaced my vinyl? Yes. I started buying again about five years ago. I\u2019ve probably got more now than I had then.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Live Aid, 1985, in a hat Freddie Mercury called \u2018awful\u2019. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nDid fairytale archetypes grab you as a child? What story couldn\u2019t you get enough of?\n\nSophie Dahl, author and former model\n\nI liked Alice In Wonderland, and I liked Peter Pan. I lived in my imagination a lot, and I loved to read: Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, Moby-Dick, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. That was what allowed your imagination to run riot \u2013 books and listening to the radio. There was no TV, or at least we didn\u2019t have one at that point, so you were forced to visualise stuff yourself. And I think that helped me when I became a songwriter. With Bernie\u2019s lyrics, I could put images to his words very quickly, because I had a great visual imagination. So with something like Tiny Dancer, I could see the song, I could imagine what was going on straight away.\n\nHow do you keep touring fun when you\u2019re not on stage?\n\nBillie Eilish, singer\n\nWhen I was younger, everything about touring was incredibly exciting. We were running on adrenaline and everything was a new experience, even getting on a plane. Now I try and come home after shows as often as I can. If I\u2019m staying in the city I play in, I go to photography galleries, museums. I go shopping, I see friends for lunch. It\u2019s hard if you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere \u2013 but if that\u2019s the case, I always take a book of crosswords.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Sting, Trudie Styler, Gianni and Donatella Versace, 1997. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nYour fans may not have known about your classical training at the Royal Academy of Music until they saw Rocketman. If you had your time again, would you still go through it?\n\nJonathan Freeman-Attwood, principal, the Royal Academy of Music\n\nIn a heartbeat. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be a classical pianist \u2013 my hands are too small and I wanted to be a rock\u2019n\u2019roll player. But it was a wonderful place, even if it was full of fear \u2013 it was strict, they hated anything that wasn\u2019t classical music, although it\u2019s very different now. I learned so much from being in the choir, from the other musicians, from the teachers. You can hear it in the Elton John album: The King Must Die, The Greatest Discovery, Sixty Years On. I\u2019d advise anyone to get formal training, because it teaches you the rudiments \u2013 chord structure, melody. It introduces you to music that\u2019s beautiful and miles away from what you might do. It fills your mind with options.\n\nAny ghost sightings at your manor lately?\n\nKacey Musgraves, singer\n\nMy manor! Woodside, my house in Windsor, is meant to be haunted, but I\u2019ve never seen a ghost and I\u2019ve lived there since 1974. David saw her, though. It was a Victorian lady. She sat on the bed and asked him if he could stop the noise outside \u2013 there were deer rutting in the park. David was very calm. I\u2019d have been frightened to death!\n\nI did see a ghost once, in a hotel in Belgium that used to be a convent. I went to bed and felt something pressing down on my chest. I was too terrified to move. So, strictly speaking, I haven\u2019t seen a ghost, but I have been sat on by one.\n\nWhere did your love of football and Watford FC come from?\n\nTroy Deeney, Watford captain\n\nMy cousin, Roy Dwight, was a professional footballer. He played for Fulham, so as a kid I used to sit on the touchline at Craven Cottage and watch him. This is how old I am \u2013 Jimmy Hill was playing for Fulham at the time. And then my dad took me to see Watford, because they were our local team. I was six or seven. I fell in love with the whole experience. And that was it. You can\u2019t shake your team: it\u2019s in your blood and your bones, even when they\u2019re completely shit. Obviously, when they\u2019re doing well it\u2019s wonderful, but the other week they lost 8-0 to Manchester City and I wanted to crawl into a hole and die. But you can\u2019t support anyone else. Watford are my team, and I\u2019m glad. I never thought I\u2019d end up owner of the club, or a director, but Watford saved my life. Working with them kept me grounded when my life was going completely crazy \u2013 it reminded me of my roots, of who I really was. I\u2019m forever grateful to them. Except when they lose 8-0.
