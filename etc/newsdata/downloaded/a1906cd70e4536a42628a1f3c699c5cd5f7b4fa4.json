Give much of the credit to \"The Leftovers\" producer-writer Tom Perrotta -- adapting his book -- and star Kathryn Hahn, who throws her all into a role distinguished by its lack of clear definition.\n\nHahn's Eve Fletcher is proudly shipping her son off the college when the seven episodes begin, grappling -- for the first time since her divorce -- with an empty nest and the prospect of being truly alone. That leads her on what amounts to a journey of sexual self-discovery, one that includes watching a great deal of porn, albeit sheepishly.\n\nYet if Eve is struggling with what comes next, her son, Brendan (Jackson White), isn't faring much better. A sort-of jerky frat-boy-type in high school, he has trouble finding his footing in college, where his swagger is frequently equated (correctly, much of the time) with arrogance. (Disney Channel star Cameron Boyce, who tragically died in July, plays his roommate, who sees through his bravado.)\n\nEve, meanwhile, works at a retirement home, where her declining patients offer a sobering preview of what's on tap for, well, all of us, including one who -- in the throes of dementia -- has lost all his sexual inhibitions.\n\nEve also enrolls in a writing class, which brings her into contact with an assortment of characters -- each with their own insecurities and issues -- including Julian (Owen Teague), a shy high-school classmate of her son's.\n\nRead More", "description": "Kathryn Hahn stars in a rare coming-of-middle-age story from producer-novelist Tom Perrotta", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191022153332-mrs-fletcher-hbo-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
