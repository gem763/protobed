We did some tests. And then a month later he said, 'You have the worst diet I've ever met from any patient.'\n\n\"So I went, 'Okay, out of the smoking, the drinking, and diet, what do I have to drop?' and he said, 'The diet'.\n\n\"So I said, 'I'm in!'\"\n\nComedian Frank Skinner recently poked fun at Simon and his cosmetic procedures, laughing that \"it was done in darkness\".\n\nThe comic joked: \"I remember Simon Cowell when he had his first face.\n\n\"I've known him a long time. The current one is a bit Slipknot. It's actually quite terrifying.\n\n\"It looks like his nose is juggling his eyes. They are at different levels.\n\n\"A man of his money you'd think could get the best plastic surgeon in the world.\n\n\"I think it's to do with the power cuts we had recently, I think it was done in darkness. It really is shocking.\n\n\"If he was born like that you'd feel cruel saying it but as he's picked it out of a catalogue of some kind, I presume it was a double spread and there was a fold in the middle.\"", "description": "Simon's face appeared nipped and tucked as he partied with a bottle of wine and cigarettes after a fancy family dinner", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Backgrid", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535915.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-Simon-Cowell-celebrates-his-60th-with-friends-and-family-at-Nobu-in-Malibu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
