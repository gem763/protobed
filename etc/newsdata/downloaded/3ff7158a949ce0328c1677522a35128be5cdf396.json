That's a bold step forward that responds to the reality of a lot of workers who aren't working a traditional job with traditional hours,\" he said.\n\nCurrently, workers need to have accumulated between 420 and 700 hours of insurable employment during a qualifying period \u2014 typically a year \u2014 to be entitled to EI benefits.\n\nA New Democrat government would also increase the wage-replacement rate to 60 per cent from 55 per cent.\n\nTuesday was the NDP campaign's eighth straight day in British Columbia, where Singh has made several regionally focused announcements.\n\nThe cafe meet-and-greet came the day after Singh said an NDP government would spend $10 billion over the next four years to create 500,000 new child-care spaces in Canada with the goal of offering free services for some parents.\n\nSingh said prices would be capped at $10 a day and build on a similar program in Quebec as well as a pilot project that started last year in British Columbia.\n\nWhile campaigning in Vancouver, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said an NDP government would permit new parents to take shorter parental leaves while collecting full Employment Insurance benefits. Singh said this promise is a response \"to the new reality\" of many parents who \"don't have the traditional 9 to 5 jobs.\" 0:58\n\nHe said the goal is to get to universality, which would mean no cost for families that can't afford it and low cost for those that can.\n\nThe Liberals have promised that new parents won't pay any taxes on maternity and parental leave benefits, while the Conservatives have promised a tax credit that would effectively return the money paid.\n\nThe Liberals have also pledged to extend EI benefits for parents who adopt and to increase the Canada Child Benefit for children under a year old. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has argued that benefit mirrors a similar program introduced by a previous Conservative government that saw all families, regardless of income, receive monthly payments.\n\nThe National's face-to-face interviews\n\nCBC is hosting a series of face-to-face interviews between undecided voters and federal leaders campaigning for next month's election.\n\nHow to watch:\n\nWatch the interviews on CBC News Network starting at 8 p.m. ET\n\nWatch on the CBC News App or CBC Gem at 8 p.m. ET\n\nWatch on The National at 10 p.m. on CBC TV across the country.", "description": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says a New Democrat government would allow new parents to condense their Employment Insurance benefits so they can take shorter parental leaves while still receiving the full benefit.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5304392.1569949874!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-ndp-20191001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
