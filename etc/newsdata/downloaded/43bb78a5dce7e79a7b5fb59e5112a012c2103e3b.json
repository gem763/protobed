Tulsi Gabbard is being \u201cgroomed\u201d by Russians to act as a spoiler in the 2020 race may have had the opposite effect of what the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee intended: It\u2019s elevated Gabbard\u2019s candidacy and may have inspired even more ardent interest in her campaign among Clinton critics.\n\nOn Saturday, Gabbard found fans among the many Clinton skeptics across Iowa, where Clinton barely won the 2016 Democratic caucuses against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cWhat is this horrible thing that Hillary said about you?\u201d one person asked Gabbard at a house party in West Branch.\n\nGabbard responded that \u201cit revealed the truth that I have been experiencing for a long time now \u2014 which is that, because I have been trying to bring about an end to our country\u2019s long-held foreign policy of waging one regime-change war after the next . I am labeled as a traitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a message that is being sent to every single American . who speaks out for peace,\u201d she said.\n\nGabbard\u2019s longshot campaign came under scrutiny this past week after Clinton appeared on a podcast where she did not mention the Hawaii congresswoman by name, but said she believes the Russians have \u201cgot their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third party candidate.\u201d There was no mistaking whom she meant.\n\nGabbard\u2019s campaign has been promoted by Russian state-owned media and a number of alt-right websites and defended on Twitter by the Russian Embassy. She\u2019s previously faced controversy and criticism from leaders in her party for her unorthodox foreign policy positions, like her decision to meet Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, Gabbard refused to disavow the support she\u2019s seen from Russian actors and alt-right sites. But she repeatedly said she will not run as an independent or third-party candidate if she doesn\u2019t win the Democratic nomination.\n\nAnd Gabbard encountered supporters across eastern Iowa on Saturday. During a campaign stop in Iowa City at a University of Iowa tailgate, a man came up to give Gabbard a ushanka-style yellow Hawkeye hat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Russian hat!\u201d Gabbard said with a laugh, before hugging the man and taking a picture with him.\n\nAnd at the West Branch house party, Gabbard found many Clinton critics who were supportive of her campaign.\n\nClinton\u2019s comments were \u201cdivisive and despicable,\u201d said Patricia McIntosh, 83, a semi-retired university employee who liked Gabbard\u2019s \u201canti-regime-change message.\u201d McIntosh said: \u201cI have no respect for Hillary Clinton at all.\u201d\n\nRobert Rodriguez, a 35-year-old food delivery driver, drove from Minneapolis to see Gabbard speak. He, too, appreciated Gabbard\u2019s anti-war stance and said Clinton had \u201csowed division in this primary\u201d with her critique. He also noted Gabbard\u2019s support from some alt-right websites\n\nHe asked: \u201cYou have people praising candidates for being able to reach across the aisle and garner support from the so-called other side, but Tulsi\u2019s a problem because she has support from the other side? Isn\u2019t that what we want?\u201d\n\nBoth Rodriguez and McIntosh described themselves as longtime Gabbard fans and skeptics of the Democratic establishment, and both said they weren\u2019t sure if they\u2019d support the eventual nominee if neither Gabbard nor Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, another anti-establishment candidate for president, didn\u2019t win.\n\nBut Gabbard also managed to win over some people who hadn\u2019t been familiar with her campaign, like Jennifer Rogers, a 38-year-old nurse from North Liberty, Iowa, who liked that Gabbard was a military veteran.\n\n\u201cI really like that she answers questions,\u201d she said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t just shout talking points and campaign slogans.\u201d Rogers said she\u2019s been on the fence but \u201ctoday I\u2019m pretty convinced that I think she\u2019s going to be my candidate.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s unclear exactly what Gabbard hopes to achieve with her unorthodox campaign, as she\u2019s struggled to raise money and hit the polling threshold to make it on the debate stage. She has yet to qualify for next month\u2019s debate.\n\nGabbard has just three staff members on the ground in Iowa.\n\nAsked whether she plans to add staff in any of the early states, Gabbard demurred.\n\nShe said she\u2019s \u201ccontinuing to use every platform possible to reach voters directly\u201d when asked about her path to the nomination, and wouldn\u2019t predict how she\u2019d finish in Iowa. But she suggested that might not matter \u2014 even if she doesn\u2019t have enough delegates to win, \u201cwe\u2019re taking this all the way to the nomination.\u201d", "description": "WEST BRANCH, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton's suggestion this past week that Hawaii Rep.
