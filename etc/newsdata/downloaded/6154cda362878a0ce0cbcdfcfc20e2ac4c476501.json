[The attack] will only make your business better,\u201d one internet user posted.\n\nBut some were less supportive.\n\n\u201cI wish your cafe to be as popular as the Bank of China, Best Mart 360 and Maxim\u2019s,\u201d another message read, referring to the vandalism campaigns by radical anti-government protesters.\n\nSingalong held in Tsim Sha Tsui in support of the city's ethnic minority communities\n\nDespite Thursday\u2019s attack, cafe owner Cheung said he would continue to support students with free meals.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stop doing it simply because of such a small incident,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI will always support young people. Society is unfair to them.
