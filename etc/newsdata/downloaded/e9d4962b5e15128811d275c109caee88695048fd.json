That requires passing the secondary school baccalaureate, or \u201cbac.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was afraid that I was sick and that I was going to miss the exams, but fortunately the Ebola treatment center officials had appealed for me to take the exams,\u201d he said. \u201cI had already lost six members of our family, including my mother, who asked me to continue with studies because that is the key to life.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old was able to take the exam after staffers at the treatment center run by the Alliance for International Medical Action, or ALIMA, in the eastern city of Beni came up with a solution.\n\nThey found a school official willing to proctor the exam as Mabowa took it safely behind a window. The papers were passed to him without touching him. After finishing, he held the pages up one by one to the window so they could be photographed with a smartphone and then emailed to officials for scoring.\n\nThen his work and his pencil were incinerated.\n\nThis week Mabowa, who was released from the center in July, celebrated with friends by throwing powder on each other\u2019s heads, a local tradition when passing the exam.\n\nHis Latin teacher, Muhindo Bukangali Loboto, said he prayed for him every day.\n\n\u201cClaude was among the best-educated who loved his studies and he has shown us what he is capable of,\u201d he said.\n\nWith nearly 2,000 confirmed deaths in eastern Congo, the Ebola outbreak is far from over. Health workers have been challenged by community mistrust and insecurity caused by years of rebel attacks.\n\nMabowa is a glimmer of hope.\n\nHe says now that he has survived Ebola and passed his exam, the next hurtle is going to a university. He said he hopes to study political science at the University of Kisangani, and he appealed for support.\n\n\u201cAfter Ebola there is life,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The young Ebola patient who took his college entrance exam while being treated in isolation has passed the demanding test, to the joy of many in Congo where his story is now well-known.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Al-Hadji Kudra Maliro"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/congo_ebola_a_mothers_wish_86712_c0-288-6900-4311_s1770x1032.jpg?bc46a4c9f3f184ac374ab124ecdacd883a3aab06", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
