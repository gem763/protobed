He downgraded Perpetual's earnings per share estimates for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years as a result.\n\nMr Sotiriou noted that Perpetual's September quarter closing FUM is 23.3 per cent below peak levels of $34.7 billion in March 2015.\n\nJarden analysts, who also said outflows were larger than expected, point out it is the \"tenth consecutive quarter of outflow\" for the troubled fund manager.\n\nGrowth vs. value\n\nPartly the decline is being attributed to Perpetual's investment philosophy being unsuited to the times.\n\n\"[This] difficult environment continues to favour growth [over] value style investment strategies,\" Mr Sotiriou said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \"value-based approach to investing\" is still touted on Perpetual's website as a key differentiator and selling point, partly due to its winning of \"six fund manager of the year awards\" over the course of the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nBeyond its specific investment strategy, Mr Sotiriou suggested the company may have been a casualty of waning confidence in stockpicking and active investment management more broadly.\n\n\"Investors are wary of investment managers that charge active management fees and that have underperformed the index over a prolonged period of time,\" he said. \"It is important for Perpetual to maintain reputable performance metrics across its product offering.\"\n\nJarden's analysts are comparatively more optimistic on Perpetual's performance, noting that its Industrial Share Fund and Australian Share Fund \"outperformed over one month, with three-month performance also improving over the quarter\". Jarden maintains a neutral rating on Perpetual's stock.\n\nRob Adams, the former Janus Henderson executive appointed Perpetual boss in May 2018 and tasked with turning around the 133-year-old fund manager's fading fortunes, told The Australian Financial Review in August that he is doubling down on the longstanding investment philosophy.\n\n\"You need a bit of [turbulence] in macro-economic conditions to show your style,\" he said. \"Stock selection becomes critical. That's when you really prove your worth.\"\n\nPerpetual recruited Franklin Templeton's southeast Asian sales head Adam Quaife as its general manager of distribution, set to commence in December.", "description": "Managed funds pioneer Perpetual has delivered its lowest level of FUM since 2013.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2357%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_82/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6a89666b09bf22e550daa63952fd1e239e365d6c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
