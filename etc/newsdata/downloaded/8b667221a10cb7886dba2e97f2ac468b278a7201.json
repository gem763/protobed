One woman was taken away on a stretcher for unspecified reasons\n\nIn one the 11-year-old girl tells operators her mother 'might have a seizure soon'.\n\nShe cries as she tells them: 'She needs an ambulance. I cannot live without my mom. Get her out of here as fast as you can, people.'\n\nThe youngster begs for help more than 15 times during the hour long call, Click Orlando reports.\n\nShe calls it 'the worst day of (her) life', adding: 'Isn't Disney supposed to the happiest place on earth? What happened to the happiest place on earth?'\n\nThe call ends as rescuers make their way to the mother and daughter.\n\nIn another call a man describes how his 32-year-old wife has a heart condition and is 'not going to last long' as she can be heard distressed in the background.\n\nTelling the operator she was 'burning up', he added: 'I'm just getting really concerned now. It's nearly two hours.'\n\nAnd one man, concerned for his 88-year-old mother, tells operators: 'She's completely alert, she's just getting panicky.'\n\nHe tried to open the gondola door by himself as they were close to the platform.\n\nRescuers reached them around seven minutes into that call.\n\nStranded passengers shared photos of gondolas that crashed into each other on social media\n\nSeveral stranded passengers shared photos of gondolas that had crashed into each other on social media as they complained that Disney officials weren't communicating what was going on.\n\nAaron Murray, one of the park-goers who was stuck in a gondola with his girlfriend and six other people, said that the long wait and lack of communication was the most frustrating part of the incident.\n\n'They didn't really say the reason that was causing the delay. The message that just kept coming over again and again is that they were sorry for the delay,' Murray said. 'We were getting better information off of Twitter.'\n\nThe gondola behind them was assisted first possibly because there was a person that needed help, he said. Murray said he saw a woman being placed on a stretcher.\n\nStranded passengers complained Disney officials weren't communicating what was going on\n\nThe Skyliner air gondolas opened to visitors last week. The cable cars whisk visitors from hotels to theme parks three stories above the ground while going 11 mph (file photo)\n\nMurray recently moved to the Orlando area from Missouri and became a Disney pass holder.\n\nHe was hoping to catch the new 'Epcot Forever' nighttime show.\n\n'We were trying to celebrate at Epcot, and we ended up seeing 'Epcot Forever' but from the sky,' he said. 'We could barely see it.'\n\nDisney officials said in a statement that one of the new cable car system routes 'experienced an unexpected downtime'.\n\n'The Skyliner will be closed while we look into the details surrounding this downtime,' the statement said.\n\n'We are working with each guest individually regarding impacts to their visit with us.'\n\nIt is still not clear what caused the incident or how many people were rescued.\n\nThe Skyliner air gondolas had only opened to visitors in Lake Buena Vista six days earlier. The cable cars whisk visitors from hotels to theme parks three stories above the ground while going 11 mph (18 kph).\n\nNo more than 10 people are allowed in each cable car. There are almost 300 air gondolas, allowing the cabins to handle about 3,000 people an hour.\n\nThey are painted with neon colors and with the images of almost two dozen Disney characters.", "description": "The Skyliner at Walt Disney World in  Florida stalled on October 5 for three hours.
