Each Friday, The Verge\u2019s Cut the Crap column simplifies the choice by sorting through the overwhelming multitude of movies and TV shows on subscription services, and recommending a single perfect thing to watch this weekend.\n\nWhat to watch\n\n\u201cThe Entire History of You,\u201d a season 1 episode of the science-fiction anthology series Black Mirror. The story is set in a near-future society where the hot technology is a skull implant that turns memories into first-person video clips, which people can either rewatch themselves or share with others. Toby Kebbell plays Liam Foxwell, a paranoid attorney who obsessively scrutinizes the interactions between his wife Ffion (Jodie Whittaker) and her friend Jonas (Tom Cullen), determined to figure out whether they\u2019re having an affair.\n\nTo date, \u201cThe Entire History of You\u201d is the only Black Mirror episode without a writing credit for the show\u2019s creator, Charlie Brooker. It\u2019s the work of screenwriter Jesse Armstrong, a British screenwriter who was one of the major creative contributors to two of the 2000s\u2019 sharpest TV sitcoms: Peep Show and The Thick of It. Armstrong recently won an Emmy for writing the HBO drama Succession, which he also created.\n\nWhy watch now?\n\nBecause Succession\u2019s season 2 finale airs Sunday night on HBO.\n\nSuccession is the story of Logan Roy (played by Brian Cox), a ruthless right-wing billionaire media tycoon loosely modeled on Rupert Murdoch. In increasingly poor health, and increasingly beset by political, cultural, and business enemies, Logan has spent the show\u2019s first two seasons wondering which of his children are best suited to take over his business. Will it be Kendall (Jeremy Strong), his doggedly committed but emotionally unstable right-hand man? How about Roman (Kieran Culkin), the impish brat torn between winning his father\u2019s approval and treating his entire life as one big joke? Could it be Siobhan (Sarah Snook), the quick-thinking, well-connected rising star who seems to value social status over her nominally liberal ideals? It definitely won\u2019t be Connor (Alan Ruck), a lifelong playboy who knows nothing about business or government \u2014 but still thinks he should be the next president of the United States.\n\nHBO didn\u2019t send this season\u2019s finale to critics in advance, but if it\u2019s anything like season 1, expect jaw-dropping plot twists aplenty. Part of what\u2019s made Succession so addicting is that Armstrong isn\u2019t afraid to pull the rug out from under the Roys on a regular basis. It\u2019s how he toys with the audience\u2019s sympathy: he makes these ultimately terrible characters just likable enough that when they\u2019re knocked flat, viewers cheer for them to fight back. It\u2019s an ingenious approach to a show about mega-wealth and privilege, illustrating how easy it is for ordinary people to develop a rooting interest in powerful folks whose lives and work make the world worse.\n\nArmstrong has finessed this trick throughout his writing and producing career, exploring how even at their lousiest, human beings are more relatable than many may want to believe. That\u2019s definitely one of the tactics he uses in \u201cThe Entire History of You,\u201d which presents its hero Liam as cruel and destructive as he pursues his suspicions about his wife\u2019s infidelity, but also shrewd in the way he uses his lawyerly intuition to unpack the layers of meaning in every casual gesture or offhand remark. Even when he\u2019s wrong, Liam\u2019s lack of trust mostly seems reasonable.\n\nAnother way \u201cThe Entire History of You\u201d resembles Succession (as well as The Thick of It and HBO\u2019s Veep, which Armstrong wrote for in season 1) is in its fascination with painfully awkward group interactions. This has become Succession\u2019s primary organizing principle, sending the Roy clan to a new location or event in each episode, then watching them squirm through meet-and-greets. Similarly, in the opening third of \u201cThe Entire History of You,\u201d Jonas makes a wince-inducing spectacle of himself at a dinner party, bloviating about sex and technology while Ffion giggles and Liam seethes.\n\nWho it\u2019s for\n\nFans of dystopian science fiction and biting social satire.\n\nLike a lot of the best Black Mirror episodes, \u201cThe Entire History of You\u201d considers big technological breakthroughs in microscopic detail, looking at how they might affect everyday life. If people could revisit their own memories with perfect recall, what would change? Armstrong imagines a world where airport security scans passengers\u2019 brains to make sure they haven\u2019t met with any terrorists, and where parents tap into their children\u2019s memory chips to check on their babysitters. Rather than swapping pet-peeve anecdotes, friends instead show each other their videos, seeking validation for whatever slights they\u2019ve perceived.\n\nThe most provocative element in \u201cThe Entire History of You,\u201d though, has to do with the idea that recorded memories could prevent people from misremembering or misrepresenting their own experiences \u2014 thereby insuring that the news is more accurate, the justice system is more efficient, and marital arguments are more easily resolved. On the contrary, Armstrong shows Liam and Ffion both editing and shaping and reinterpreting their own memories, until even the happiest moments of their lives become instruments of torture.\n\nWhere to see it\n\nNetflix. For more of Jesse Armstrong\u2019s work, Veep and Succession are available on HBO Go and HBO Now; and Peep Show and The Thick of It are available on both Amazon Prime and Hulu.", "description": "Jesse Armstrong\u2019s \"The Entire History of You\" \u2014 the only episode of Black Mirror to date without a co-writing credit from creator Charlie Brooker \u2014 shares some of Succession\u2019s best narrative tricks. With Succession\u2019s season 2 finale coming to HBO, it\u2019s a terrific time to revisit Armstrong\u2019s past work on Black Mirror, Veep, and The Thick of It.", "authors": ["Noel Murray", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7o_0kse-0dSYEbDpzsLywcHI4kw=/0x0:1920x1005/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19279492/the_entire_history_of_you_gq_06jun19_b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
