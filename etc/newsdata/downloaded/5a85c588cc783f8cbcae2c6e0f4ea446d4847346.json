Nissan employs nearly 7,000 people in Sunderland.\n\nThe potential closure - first reported by Bloomberg - comes after the manufacturer announced earlier this month that it will end night shifts at its Sunderland plant and warned the factory would become untenable if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\n\nIt is also looking at options for a site in Barcelona where 3,000 people work. The firm is seeking to cut 12,500 jobs worldwide.", "description": "Nissan is weighing up a sale of its Sunderland plant in what would be a dramatic blow to the UK car industry.", "authors": ["Simon Foy", "Alan Tovey", "Industry Editor", "Ryan Bourne", "Ambrose Evans-Pritchard", "Ben Wright"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2019/03/04/TELEMMGLPICT000187497720-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcM9aBJczjGu2JtrWg8AaNebpMG9uWgcnc3MvHmUFhjA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
