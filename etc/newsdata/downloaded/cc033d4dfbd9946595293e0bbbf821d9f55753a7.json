His other no-no was in 2007 for the Tigers against Milwaukee.\n\nThe 36-year-old Verlander joined Nolan Ryan (seven), Sandy Koufax (four) and Bob Feller, Cy Young and Larry Corcoran (three) in rarefied air on the no-hitter list.\n\nVerlander threw a season-high 120 pitches, mixing a fastball that reached the upper 90s mph with a sharp curve.\n\nVerlander (17-5) is tied for the big league lead in wins. He tops the majors in strikeouts (257) and innings (193) and leads the AL with a 2.56 ERA.\n\nVerlander retired the last 26 hitters in a row. But the game was scoreless going into the last inning - according to baseball rules, Verlander needed to pitch a complete game to get credit for a no-hitter.\n\nThat\u2019s when Canadian-born rookie Abraham Toro stepped up for the AL West leaders. The Astros newcomer hit a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth inning off Ken Giles (2-3) that cleared the way for Verlander to complete the no-hitter.\n\nPHILLIES 5, METS 2\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - Scott Kingery snapped an eighth-inning tie with a three-run double and Philadelphia beat New York to avoid a three-game sweep.\n\nBrad Miller hit a solo homer and a double for the Phillies, who pulled within 2\u00bd games of the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild card.\n\nPete Alonso hit his 43rd homer and Wilson Ramos extended his hitting streak to 25 consecutive games with a fourth-inning double for the Mets, who are four games behind the Cubs.\n\nDaniel Zamora (0-1), who was just recalled from the minors, took the loss.\n\nHector Neris (3-5) got the final five outs for Philadelphia.\n\nPhillies starter Zach Eflin pitched seven stellar innings, allowing only Alonso\u2019s first-inning homer and two other hits.\n\nMets starter Marcus Stroman also pitched well, giving up two runs on seven hits with six strikeouts and two walks in six-plus innings.\n\nYANKEES 5, ATHLETICS 4\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Brett Gardner and pinch-hitter Mike Ford hit back-to-back homers off A\u2019s closer Liam Hendriks, and New York rallied from four runs down and walked off for the second straight game.\n\nGardner led off the ninth with a shot to right off Hendriks (4-2) and Ford followed with his 10th homer into the Yankees bullpen in right-center.\n\nA\u2019s left-hander Sean Manaea pitched one-hit ball over five innings in his first start since shoulder surgery last September, and Oakland led 4-0 after 7 1/2 innings.\n\nAdam Ottavino (6-4) pitched a scoreless inning to win.\n\nTWINS 8, TIGERS 3\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Jake Cave and Nelson Cruz each drove in two runs and Minnesota beat Detroit.\n\nThe Twins increased their lead in the AL Central to 5 \u00bd games over Cleveland.\n\nDetroit has lost seven of eight and still needs four wins at Comerica Park to avoid becoming the first big league team to lose 60 games at home in a season.\n\nCave\u2019s two-run single highlighted a five-run second inning.\n\nMichael Pineda (11-5) got the win, giving up two runs on five hits and a walk in six innings. He struck out nine.\n\nSpencer Turnbull (3-14) took the loss, allowing six runs on eight hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings.\n\nRAYS 8, INDIANS 2\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla.
