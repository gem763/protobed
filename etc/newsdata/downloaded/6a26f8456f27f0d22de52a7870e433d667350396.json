But he said the biggest problem he\u2019s faced is resisting the temptation of food that lies around every corner.\n\n\u201cThe problem is with nutrition,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cI get offered food everywhere, sometimes there\u2019s a whole banquet, it\u2019s a little difficult. They offer all sorts of things. Some might find it funny, but for me it\u2019s not funny because I\u2019m the one who has to drop those 16-17kg. Yes. That\u2019s how much.\n\n\u201cNutrition is the most important thing. Now I understand why, because when I was 23 I ate a lot but now I\u2019m 31 and I digest food differently because the metabolism slows down. I constantly have to stay at a certain weight. Even when I eat now I think of the weight I have to cut in 5-6 months. Therefore you don\u2019t eat enough, psychologically you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Stop hitting old people and get in line': Khabib tells Conor McGregor what he needs to do to earn rematch (VIDEO)\n\nWhen asked what he ate, and was told gymnasts sometimes say they eat just a blade of grass a day, Nurmagomedov joked about his out-of-camp guilty food pleasures.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m definitely not eating blades of grass,\u201d he smiled.\n\n\u201cRight now I eat well everywhere. Meat, a lot of meat. Bread\u2026 I can\u2019t do without bread and tea with sugar. I\u2019m not a fan of butter. I like sour cream, cottage cheese\u2026 preferably fatty.\n\n\u201cTwo months before I fight I follow a strict diet. The last time it was my best weight cut because I recovered well, I gained 10kg. When I entered the octagon I weighed 80kg and a day before I was at 70.3kg.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com 'The word retirement doesn\u2019t mean anything': UFC legend Georges St-Pierre remains interested in Khabib Nurmagomedov fight\n\nWhen asked how on earth it\u2019s possible for him to gain almost 10kg in a day, Khabib joked: \u201cSour cream! With high fat content!\u201d before revealing another of his guilty pleasures: \u201cCondensed milk. I like it on pancakes.\u201d\n\nKhabib\u2019s light-hearted comments about his diet then turned into a serious tale about how cutting weight has badly affected him in the past.\n\n\u201cI almost died once from cutting weight, that happened,\u201d he said before laughing it off by saying: \u201cI think I had too much sour cream!\n\n\u201cThis other time when I had major problems with cutting weight, well more so than cutting weight I had health problems due to my kidneys. I had to be treated, had do a lot of aftercare. It\u2019s the nature of the sport. We consciously take on such a big risk and there\u2019s a big chance that you can ruin your health.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Tony you're in trouble!' Khabib Nurmagomedov prepares for UFC title fight by battling Dagestani rapids (VIDEO)\n\nBut while Khabib admitted he\u2019s had some serious battles when cutting weight in the past, he hasn\u2019t had so many issues during the fights themselves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a notable fact that in my 10-year amateur career and 11 years as a professional, I don\u2019t remember a single time I had a bruise,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done contact sports all my life and no one\u2019s ever hit me so that it left a bruise or a scratch after a fight. In that sense the almighty supports me.\u201d", "description": "UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov has never been defeated in his MMA career, but he admitted that his battle with the scale has pushed him harder than almost any opponent in his career.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da62c2c85f5401e3a0587c9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
