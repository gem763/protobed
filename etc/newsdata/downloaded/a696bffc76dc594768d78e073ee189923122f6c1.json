Why send emergency services to look after or get a moron down?\n\n'Leave him there until he gets himself out.\n\n'No emergency services should help them, nobody should do anything, and you just put little witches hats around them, or use them as a speedbump.'\n\nKennerley's co-host Sarah Harris put her head in her hands and said: 'Kerri-Anne, god, you're going to get us into trouble.'\n\nKennerley remained defiant and asked: 'Is that wrong?'\n\nHarris then said she supports big fines but asked 'jail time is a bit out there isn't it?'\n\nKennerley replied: 'No put them in jail and forget to feed them'.\n\nAs the discussion continued, Kennerley offered a message to the protesters: 'Here's an idea. Why don't all you extremists go to china or Saudi Arabia and do it?'\n\n'If we all pedalled to work, if we stop doing anything that harms the environment in Australia, it makes no difference.\n\n'Do it where it is going to count which is China, India and America. Go and do it over there.'\n\nKennerley then asked Harris: 'Was that a bit extreme do you think?'\n\nHarris replied: 'No, no' before ending the section.\n\nExtinction Rebellion spokesman James Norman said: 'We are a peaceful, nonviolent organisation at the centre of all our tactics and messaging.\n\n'Kerri-Anne Kennerley really should think very carefully before making such statements about the impacts they could have.\n\nHe added: 'Respect for other people is at the centre of our ethos and principles, and I would hope other people, especially public commentators, would approach us with the same level of respect for common decency.'\n\nKerri-Anne Kennerley (pictured today) has launched a blistering rant at climate change protesters as a week of demonstrations paralyses the country\n\nProtesters are removed and arrested during an Extinction Rebellion protest in Sydney on Monday 7 October\n\nPaul Jukes, 49, was dangling in a hammock from a makeshift harness about 10 metres below Brisbane's Story Bridge on Tuesday as part of the protests\n\nPolice negotiators arrived on the scene at 7.45am on Tuesday and tried to talk the 49-year-old down off the bridge. He was eventually arrested\n\nThousands will take to major roads across Australia this week to protest inaction on climate change, under the banner of Extinction Rebellion. Pictured: A protest on Broadway in Sydney on Monday\n\nThousands of climate change protesters have descended on Australia's capital cities for a week of disruptive protests which include 'sit ins' on busy roads, flash mobs and singalongs.\n\nIn Brisbane protesters have promised a 'Water Birth For A Better Earth' event at Southbank River Quay.\n\n'Swarming Flash Mobs' will also roam Queens Gardens throughout the week.\n\nA 'swarm for survival' is planned for Wednesday, an 'extinction rave' for Friday night and a 'nudie parade' for Saturday.\n\nIn Sydney protesters have insisted they will not disrupt Sydney's rail network as they continue their week-long action to highlight climate change.\n\nMore than 40 activists have been arrested in the city so far, with some saying they are willing to risk their liberty in order to bring climate issues to the fore.\n\nNSW police said on Tuesday they were aware of plans for Extinction Rebellion demonstrators to target the Sydney rail network on Wednesday, and urged the group to not disrupt travellers and commuters.\n\nMick Willing, NSW Police assistant commissioner, said: 'The rail network is an integral part of the integrity of the city so I would ask that protesters not disrupt people going about their day-to-day rail travel, and to ensure that they are safe.'\n\nPaul Jukes, 49, hung from a makeshift harness below the bridge on Tuesday morning; initially saying he was prepared to stay suspended 50m above the river for as long as he could\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion spokeswoman said the group's actions would not be disruptive, but instead would involve activists simply boarding trains and speaking to commuters about climate issues.\n\nA group met at Central Station on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn Melbourne at least 100 protesters are expected to camp each night in Carlton Gardens.\n\nA planned tram strike has been called off in Melbourne because of safety concerns around ongoing climate protests in the city.\n\nTram drivers had planned to walk off the job between 10am and 2pm on Thursday but the Rail, Tram and Bus Union agreed to postpone the action because of Extinction Rebellion actions.\n\nProtests dress as bees in Sydney on Tuesday\n\n'In a show of good faith, the RTBU have chosen to withdraw their notice to take industrial action this week,' Yarra Tram chief executive Nicolas Gindt said in a statement.\n\n'At the end of the day, safety is top priority for everybody at Yarra Trams.'\n\nThere were concerns around safety and drivers would also have been trapped on their trams if they were locked-in.\n\nThe union wants a five per cent annual pay rise over three years, a change from their initial demand of a six per cent increase.\n\nBut strikes could still continue if the tram company does not meet the union's demands, according to a spokesman.\n\nIn South Australia, activists will disrupt Adelaide's CBD, with similar events planned in Sydney during the week.\n\nOn Tuesday, 29 Extinction Rebellion protesters - including Paul Jukes, who suspended himself in a hammock from Brisbane's Story Bridge - were arrested and charged after blocking roads, chaining themselves to fences and attaching themselves to devices such as drums filled with cement.\n\nThe wave of recent protests has prompted state governments to draft new laws to punish protesters.\n\nQueensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Wednesday condemned this week's Extinction Rebellion protests saying activists are putting themselves and others at risk, and soaking up valuable police and emergency services resources.\n\nShe said the government wants to push through proposed laws in just days that could jail protesters for up to two years if they use 'dangerous devices' such as drums with concrete and locks.\n\nQueensland Police would also get increased powers to search people for such devices.\n\nThe Human Rights Law Centre says the government has a legitimate interest in ensuring peaceful protests but that this law goes too far.\n\nREVEALED: WHERE ACTIVISTS WILL TARGET THIS WEEK Melbourne: They plan to occupy the CBD on Tuesday and are prepared for peaceful arrests.
