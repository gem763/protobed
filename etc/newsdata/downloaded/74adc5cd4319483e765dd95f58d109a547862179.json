I see her relatively regularly,'' says Collins. \"She is very, very smart [Wilson has arts and law degrees] \u2013 and a woman who crafted her career in a very clever, and considered way.\n\n\"She understood her talent. And she understood how to make the most of her talent. And I admire her for that.\"\n\n\"You resort to best practice, you don't cut corners,\" says Collins. Arsineh Houspian\n\nCollins is more usually found at the other end of the bar table, defending media companies. He is currently arguing that the warrant issued ahead of the AFP raid on the ABC in June was invalid and he is also standing up for the 30-odd journalists and editors who have been charged with contempt in relation to the trial of disgraced cleric George Pell.\n\nHe has never received a brief from a glossy magazine, but has gone into bat against them on behalf of singer Katy Perry and actors Jim Carrey and Demi Moore (all settled before trial). It was Cicero who said a lawyer makes no friends as a prosecutor, but it seems Collins is an exception.\n\n\"When a plaintiff comes to see you the first thing they say is, 'This is not about the money, look at what they've said about me and it's ruined my life.\u2019\n\n\"The sorts of journalistic standards that I like defending are in my work for the Fin Review, The Australian or the Herald Sun. I don't see those same factors at play in the cases I have done against the glossy magazines.\"\n\nHe did end up being a villain of sorts among his regular media clients when Wilson's case proved the statutory cap for defamation (now $398,500) can be discarded if the publisher's conduct has aggravated any harm caused. That scenario played out in April this year when actor Geoffrey Rush was awarded $850,00 in general damages, as part of an overall payout of $2.9 million, awarded the following month in the Federal Court. Rush had claimed The Daily Telegraph and its publisher Nationwide News depicted him inaccurately and unfairly as a deviant in their report that he allegedly sexually harassed the actress Eryn Jean Norvill during a production of King Lear at the Sydney Wharf Theatre in 2015-16. Justice Michael Wigney ruled the paper had failed to establish a defence of truth. Rush had previously offered to settle the case for $50,000.\n\nAs we settle into lunch at Rosa's Canteen, in the heart of Melbourne's legal district, there is a steady stream of well-wishers. Collins is also the president of the Victorian Bar and has handled some tricky issues during his tenure, like the Lawyer X debacle, when barrister Nicola Gobbo turned police informant about the underworld figures she was representing at trial which resulted in the convictions of 22 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late July, one of those clients, Faruk Orman, was released from jail after 12 years \u2013 he was allegedly the getaway driver in the 2002 killing of Victor Peirce by the hitman Andrew \u201cBenji\u201d Veniamin \u2013 and is now seeking compensation. Many more are expected to follow.\n\nCollins trusts no other barrister will follow Gobbo's example.\n\n\"You resort to best practice, you don't cut corners. And what happened here was corners were cut [by police] and the rules of the game were not respected. And the consequences are now playing out, I hope we never see it again.\"\n\nCollins is also president of the Victorian Bar Association. Elke Meitzel\n\nNo corners are being cut at our dining venue. Collins explains that Rosa is a Melbourne institution.\n\n\"She'll be in the kitchen every day. She makes homemade pasta \u2013 and nothing is better than homemade pasta. We sit in this fantastic environment where we are looking directly at the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe pasta, however, is not among his menu choices on this day. After picking out a couple of entrees \u2013 grilled calamari and baccala montecato \u2013 Collins opts for the fish of the day (barramundi). The duck will also be on the table after his recommendation.\n\nThankfully he is able to enjoy a glass of wine, which becomes two as the lunch goes into extra time.\n\nIn sight is the dome of the Supreme Court library. Dr Collins explains that he spent \u201calmost every waking moment for 18 months\u201d in the glorious space researching his PhD and first book: The Law of Defamation and the Internet (2001).\n\n\u201cThe library has a special place in my heart and being able to look at it pleases me. My last three books, I haven\u2019t set foot in the library because everything is now online.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is a strong advocate of defamation law reform, pointing out the absurdity of a system that allows people to sue for hurt feelings and get more damages than someone who lost a leg. It\u2019s also not fit for the internet age.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago the daily newspaper was a record. What is the daily edition of the website of the Financial Review?\n\n\u201cAs facts change, the story changes. If errors are detected, they can be corrected instantaneously. But the law still treats every moment in time as the daily edition of a newspaper.\u201d\n\n\"I'm the Steven Bradbury of bar presidents,'' Collins says. Arsineh Houspian\n\nWhile we are on the subject of law reform, Collins says he is wary of the push for a new \"religious freedom\" law, saying it could emerge as a \"one-line bill of rights\".\n\n\u201cThe danger is the unintended consequences which can flow from a focus on one right to the exclusion of other rights. And it\u2019s generally bad to make law in response to an extreme case \u2013 and Israel Folau\u2019s case is an extreme case.\u201d\n\nCollins was born in Adelaide and moved around a lot as his school teacher parents took assorted postings, including to Papua New Guinea. He attended the Port Moresby International High School for two years, in 1982 and 1983.\n\nHe finished his schooling in Adelaide and also went to university there before moving to Melbourne for his first job out of law school: as an associate to Federal Court judge Don Ryan. He's never left.\n\nAfter six years at top-tier law firm Mallesons, he went to the bar in 1999, He made senior counsel in 2011 and has a broad commercial practice on top of his media work.\n\nCollins joined the Bar Council of Victoria in 2014, and after those ahead of him in the leadership queue left for the bench, he was elevated to the top job in 2017. \"I'm the Steven Bradbury of bar presidents,'' he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from Lawyer X, the trickiest moment of his tenure came after a study commissioned by the bar on stress in the legal profession found that judicial bullying was a major factor. In a deft piece of work, he convinced Victoria\u2019s Supreme Court chief justice Anne Ferguson to be part of the solution.\n\n\"There are really quite disturbing statistics. Only one in three of us gets enough sleep each night. We're stressed, we work too hard and the survey showed we\u2019re perfectionists, which means we're always looking over our own shoulders.\n\n\"On the other hand, our job satisfaction was sky high and we couldn't imagine ourselves doing anything else.\"\n\n\"My worst moments have always been when I think I\u2019ve made a mistake; when I've said something,\" Collins says. Arsineh Houspian\n\nHe says one problem is that barristers don't want to show any vulnerability to their clients or the other side.\n\n\"So we put on our armor, and we go into court. Sometimes we have bad days in court. Very often that\u2019s because of the way in which you've been treated by your opponent, or by the judicial officer hearing the case. Very often that contact was completely unexceptional. It's just that you feel it acutely because what we do is very public and very exposed.\"\n\nHe concedes he has had his share of \"bad days\".\n\n\"My worst moments have always been when I think I\u2019ve made a mistake; when I've said something. Perhaps I've asked one too many questions in cross examination and I\u2019ve seen a painstakingly developed strategy unravel before my eyes.\"\n\nThe all-consuming nature of the job is the reason he escapes twice a year to Paris. (Collins speaks fluent French).\n\n\"My partner and I bought a little apartment in Paris, which sounds grander than it is. We call it little William St because there are a handful of judges and barristers who have bought in the same district in Paris.\" (William Street is the legal thoroughfare of Melbourne, akin to Phillip Street in Sydney).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt my urging, we head for the dessert menu. Collins goes for the affogato, before recalling another property deal.\n\n\"I think we were outed in the pages of your paper about 20 years ago,\" he says.\n\n\"At the time I was a new barrister and he was on the board of Linfox. We were selling an apartment in St Kilda and in the executive property section of the Financial Review there was an article which said, \u2018Linfox director Leonard Vary and his partner Matt Collins are selling their apartment.\u2019\n\n\"I was relegated to second place! But in The Age it said, \u2018Media barrister Matt Collins and his partner are selling their apartment\u2019.\"\n\nAfter Collins has a coffee, which is left off the bill, we take our leave of Rosa\u2019s. Back on the street, the dome of the library is again in sight.
