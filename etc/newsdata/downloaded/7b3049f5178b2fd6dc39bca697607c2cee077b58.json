Did it need more of either? Of course not, but that's the nature of these vehicles.\n\nMy goodness, it has power. Benz had to guarantee it because it has a smaller capacity engine (a 4-litre biturbo V8 rather than the 6.3 atmo V8 fitted previously).\n\nNow for that extra letter: a less powerful version is available elsewhere, but we have only the faster S because, as one Benz person put it to me, \"with cars like this, Australians never want the less powerful version\". The output is 375 kW and 700 Nm (previously 336 kW and 600 Nm). For such a small car, these are mad numbers. The 0-100 km/h time is a supercar-like four seconds flat.\n\nNow let's move to the track. In attendance was Bernd Schneider\u200b, a Mercedes ambassador and veteran of F1, touring-car and sports-car racing.\n\n\"Where the tarmac ends the wall begins,\" he said glibly of the Bathurst circuit, before assuring us that it was every bit as difficult as the Nordschleife, the famously intimidating \"northern loop\" of Germany's Nurburgring complex. Schneider might know, he's won at both tracks. \"It is very hard to learn a track with no run-off,\" he added with a shake of his head.\n\nFor this Bathurst newcomer, his words rang very true. As someone who has driven fast on many race tracks, but never on this one except at the posted speeds (it is a public road most of the year), the learning curve was enormous, and the potential price for getting things wrong often daunting.\n\nIt's a nuanced track that doesn't seem nearly so complex on television: a concatenation of amazing elevations, short run-off areas (where there are any), and corners where you are flying blind, or at best looking for markers such as trees, or roofs of marshalling points, to get your bearings because the track itself is out of view and, for all you know, blocked by a crashed car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClever electronics\n\nDid I mention it was raining? With so much power going solely through the rear wheels, on a greasy track, you are relying on being in exactly the right part of the track at the right speed.\n\nYou are also counting on some very clever electronics that work out what you are trying to do and brake individual wheels to keep the car on the course you have plotted out. They do their work brilliantly, though at some point of course, physics always wins, so no electronics can be considered foolproof.\n\nAt many points there are huge falls to each side; sometimes you seem to be looking down hundreds of metres. At such times the only thing between you and epic fall is a very solid piece of concrete. As safe as a Benz might be, nothing is going to be very pleasant if you hit one of these walls at 200 km/h plus.\n\nAs well as a range of driving modes, the C63 is fitted with launch control. You spin the dial, it asks for confirmation \u2013 \"do you really, really want to do this?\" \u2013 and, when you affirm with a click of the gear paddle it is time to flatten the brake and the accelerator.\n\nYou lift off the brake pedal when the revs are maximum and all hell breaks loose. There is plenty of wheelspin on the wet surface, but because it can react more quickly than you can, and can vary the torque between the driven wheels, it is quicker than any human. Launch control can get the C63 from the back of the grid to the end of the Pit Straight at close to 200 km/h.\n\nThe first corner is, appropriately, called Hell. This takes you up the double-crested Mountain Straight, briefly hitting the 250 km/h speed limiter, then into Griffin's, the Cutting and Reid Park.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a lot of track \u2013 6.2 kilometres of it \u2013 and although each section is familiar to any automotively inclined television viewer, everything is tighter than it looks on the box, and steeper, and narrower, and happening a great deal faster.\n\nA huge effort was put into the sound of the new engine, and it shrieks and snaps and barks as you paddle through the gears up though Sulman and Skyline, braving blind crests as you brace yourself for the high-speed and thoroughly exhilarating drop through The Esses.\n\nOne thing here is certain: you simply aren't going to be able to wash off much speed if something goes wrong.\n\nForrest's Elbow is tight but still a let-off after the big drop. Now it's Conrod Straight, where the car is up to 250 km/h well before the first rise. In some markets the car is limited to 290 km/h and the way the car accelerates towards this lower limit, you suspect it might be possible to get reasonably close to that on Conrod.\n\nThe Chase is meant to be a kink, but at these speeds it feels tight. The 90 degree Murray's Corner takes you back on the Pit Straight and ready to do it all again. If it was the annual 1000km race, you'd be doing it another 160 times. And, on my somewhat shorter experience, I suspect in this car you'd be loving every single lap.\n\nFACT BOX\n\nModel: Mercedes-AMG C63 S\n\nPrice (excluding on-road costs): $154,900\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEngine: 4-litre twin turbo V8 (petrol)\n\nPower/torque: 375 kW/700 Nm\n\nFuel economy (combined cycle): 8.6 L/100 km\n\nC0\u2082: 200 grams per kilometre", "description": "The C63 sedan, now with an S added to the name, is a hot-rodded version of the latest generation Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.4482%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1785%2C$x_206%2C$y_477/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fc5b1a2e51634edcca9458f8bae894227c741bff", "published_at": "2015-09-22"}
