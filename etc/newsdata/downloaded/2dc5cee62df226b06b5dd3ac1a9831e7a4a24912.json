Bush under a \u201cdisproven premise\u201d of the threat of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\u201cNow we are slowly & carefully bringing our great soldiers & military home,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has faced opposition from the foreign policy establishment in Washington for his efforts to remove troops from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria and bring them home.\n\n\u201cThe stupid endless wars, for us, are ending,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, defending his decision to move 50-100 troops away from the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nTrump announced plans to withdraw 7,000 troops from Afghanistan in December 2018 and in August he announced the withdrawal of over 5,000 troops.\n\nIdeally, the president would like to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 but peace talks with the Taliban blew up in September.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Trump said he would continue to pursue an \u201cend game\u201d in the Middle East, despite criticism from both political parties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to do what we have to do, but there has to be an end game,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if you stay, it\u2019s going to be the same thing. Eventually, you\u2019re going to have to leave.\u201d\n\nFighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East. Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending! https://t.co/Fbcem9i55Z \u2014 Donald J.
