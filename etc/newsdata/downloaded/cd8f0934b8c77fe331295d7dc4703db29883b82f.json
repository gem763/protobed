We feel like playing in the humidity will give us an advantage.\n\n\u201cThe players have adjusted really well. We\u2019re very positive and there\u2019s a good feeling in the camp. Everyone is ready to start work now. We\u2019ve actually had to pull players back because they wanted to work harder. We\u2019ve had a variety of activities on and off the field. The players feel like they\u2019ve adapted to the environment as well as they can and now they\u2019re ready to begin the serious preparation for the World Cup.\n\n\u201cThe first part of the World Cup is always dependent on your travel. We had a vigorous travel schedule, but we\u2019ve settled in well now and have got used to the conditions. Players have been out and about a bit. We\u2019ve deliberately had quite an easy training week but we\u2019ll increase that starting today.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nJones also believes his star status in Japan, having masterminded their historic win over South Africa four years ago, could give England an advantage. \u201cThe Japanese love the All Blacks and that isn\u2019t going to change, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get our fair share of support \u2026 the number of English jerseys we\u2019ve seen in Miyazaki, it\u2019s been quite incredible,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll get some good support and it will make a difference because as you know Japanese rugby crowds can be quite quiet so if we\u2019ve got a number of people supporting us, it could make a difference.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones says Japan\u2019s sweltering conditions will give England the edge over their World Cup rivals", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19c14a3140051863efba2ea3db726e23c7436e19/0_368_5058_3035/master/5058.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2ed77629a1b41a3cc51abc212adff31c", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
