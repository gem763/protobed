We used the timers over a course of a week when cooking our usual meals; our meals featured rather more dippy eggs than usual as a result.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a wannabe Heston or a vintage loving baker there\u2019s a nifty timer for you below in our pick of the best.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

It allows a massive 99 hour, 59 min, 59 second timer function so you can sous vide and slow cook to your heart\u2019s content and has a useful turn reminder function to help you cook meat more evenly. It can be used inside and outdoors for barbecue cooking thanks to its water-resistant silicone coating and it has a handy temperature check reminder once your allotted time has elapsed to prompt you to test the internal temperature of your cooked meat. Not the prettiest of the lot, but one of the most functional and it is easy to use to boot. Includes two batteries.\n\nBuy now\n\nKitchen Craft colour changing egg timer: \u00a33, Robert Dyas\n\nThese are genius.

We like the dinky Silver Kettle timer, but the Kitchen Clip Timer is undeniably handy. Everyone should buy the Kitchen Craft colour changing egg too which has changed our boiled eggs for the better.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
