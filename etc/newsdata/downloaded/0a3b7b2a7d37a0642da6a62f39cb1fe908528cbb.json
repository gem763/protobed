And his track record is one that has to be taken seriously, as he was one of the first to warn in advance about the downturn that became the Great Recession.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Business Insider, Rosenberg outlined his overall strategy, citing a \"deficiency of yield and a deficiency of economic activity.\" He said both would benefit from a rise in scarcity value.\n\nHow to get yield\n\nRosenberg said he was encouraging investors to stay in the bond market, describing it as \"a great place to be.\" But the 30-year bond bull market and low interest rates mean opportunities are scarce.\n\nWhile some experts are favoring short-term bonds because it's hard to tell what direction is next for yields and rates, Rosenberg advises investors to stick with longer-term US bonds for their superior payouts. For the average investor, an ideal vehicle for this type of investment is the iShares 20-plus Year Treasury Bond ETF.\n\nRosenberg is also advocating some defensive stock picks involving companies that aren't overly reliant on economic growth, such as utilities, real-estate investment trusts, and some energy companies.\n\n\"I would be screening for companies that raised their dividends consistently in the past three years, with yields that are superior to what you get in the US Treasury curve and ones with low payout ratios,\" he said. \"They're the ones with the greatest capacity to grow their dividends.\"\n\nRosenberg reiterated his view that corporate debt has turned into a \"bubble\" as a result of a decade of ultralow interest rates.\n\nFor those stock traders looking to capitalize on this trend, Goldman Sachs recently revealed its list of high-dividend stocks, which it says will outperform as interest rates continue to fall. Here are the top 12 identified by bank.\n\nRead more: Acclaimed short seller Jim Chanos explains why he's betting against a healthcare business loved by Warren Buffett\n\nWhere to get growth\n\nRosenberg thinks global economic growth is getting worse under threat from the US-China trade war, while the situation in the US is vulnerable.\n\n\"We have a deficiency of economic growth. The OECD leading indicator last month went down for the 19th month in a row. That hasn't happened since the 2008-09 economic downturn,\" he said, referring to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nDomestically, he's concerned about weak signs from heavy industry and the housing market. Consumer spending has remained strong, but he's not sure it will last.\n\n\"We are in, in my opinion, an unprecedented period of economic and political uncertainty that will hamper spending by consumers and businesses,\" Rosenberg said.\n\nThat's another reason he's urging investors to steer clear of dependence on the economy as they look for growth.\n\n\"Blue-chip companies with strong balance sheets and stable cash flows are where you would be focused on\" to execute that strategy, he said. \"You ought to own those companies with strong balance sheets and steady income streams that are noncyclical in nature.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs also has a \"high-quality\" index that it maintains featuring companies with strong balance sheets.
