Photo: Adult Swim\n\nGenndy Tartakovsky is responsible for modern television\u2019s boldest animation, including Dexter\u2019s Laboratory, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Samurai Jack, as well as the Hotel Transylvania film series. The final season of Samurai Jack, which aired in 2017, represented a remarkable evolution in Tartakovsky\u2019s work: The fight scenes proved to be audacious experiments in mood, color, and sound, putting the stylings of recent big-screen action flicks to shame. It was more violent, more cutting, more mature than the series that came before it, not only visually but narratively and thematically.\n\nTartakovsky\u2019s new miniseries Primal, which premieres tonight on Adult Swim, is his most ambitious work yet. It\u2019s predicated on a striking gambit: absolutely no dialogue. The fledgling series follows a caveman in primordial times who loses his family in a vicious attack and bonds with a dinosaur also beset by tragedy. Primal boasts a gnarly, pulp sensibility. Its violence is sudden and evocative. Visually, it is both gritty and lush \u2014 marrying a sketched aesthetic with a daring color palette full of crimson, jungle green, and inky black. But most important, the show proves to be endlessly thrilling. Ahead of Primal\u2019s debut, I spoke to Tartakovsky about his influences, the art of pitching, and establishing the look of this bold world.\n\nWhat was the genesis of Primal?\n\nSix or eight years ago, I started doodling this caveman kid with big hair and a dinosaur friend and they have adventures in this weird world. It was going to be a show [for kids ages 6 to 11], but the story wasn\u2019t coming together. Everything I develop has to be organic. If a story isn\u2019t working, maybe that story doesn\u2019t want to be told.\n\nThen through the years, my tastes started to get a little older and adult cartoons started to come into popularity much more. And then came the last season of Samurai Jack. When we were doing that for Adult Swim, it was like, \u201cOh, my gosh we can do violence. We can tell more sophisticated stories. We can get more emotional, darker.\u201d Thankfully that was met with a lot of success and we had a really fun time doing it. Basically, my boss at the time, Mike Lazzo, was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d [Laughs.] In that time I have been developing Primal as a short film, so I pitched it to him. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a caveman and a dinosaur. They have a tragedy, they bond, and try to survive this primordial world. There\u2019s no dialogue.\u201d That was our launching point.\n\nIt\u2019s very audacious to do a show with no dialogue. Can you talk about your decision to use only sound and imagery to tell your story?\n\nIt was because it was a caveman. It made that decision simple. We messed around with it a little bit in the beginning. Should he grunt? Should he have a few words? It is very, very easy to become cheesy.\n\nI can see that.\n\nBecause this type of thing has been done. It\u2019s science fiction. It\u2019s pulp. It\u2019s very easy to become cheesy. [Mimics caveman noises, then laughs.] You start to laugh at it, rather than be drawn in by it. So I was like, \u201cWe can have him scream, we can have him grunt. But not grunt to talk.\u201d I think we can get away with communicating everything through our drawings.\n\nWhat is your process like? Do you see sequences in your head, then write a script to justify those action sequences?\n\nUsually, I picture some kind of vignette in my brain. Even when I write scripts, I visualize it first. I see it storyboarded in my head, then I\u2019ll try to write to describe it with words. From day one, as soon as I started drawing, that\u2019s how it\u2019s been. It used to be frustrating because I would see something, but I wasn\u2019t able to draw it. That translation is definitely getting better.\n\nThe process is: We think of an idea, an image, or sometimes just a feeling. I want to watch this episode and get this feeling from it. What elements do I need for this to happen? So the stories get really complex, but we know our limitations and we know the tools we have to use. Luckily, even from the days of Dexter, we always tried to approach it from a visual, iconic sense. We\u2019re just getting better at it now.\n\nHow do you find the right pacing and tenor for your action sequences?\n\nI always pitch. Early in my career, I realized when you\u2019re pitching something to a group of people, if you get stuck somewhere or something feels unnatural, it\u2019s wrong. A lot of the time I would just skip over it like, \u201cOh, it\u2019ll be fine when I execute it.\u201d But I was wrong. Everything is about the pitch and the storytelling, just like when you\u2019re telling a story to your friends.\n\nI believe action is very musical. There\u2019s got to be ups and downs, there\u2019s got to be slow parts and fast parts. I let the pitching guide it. For this show, I wanted everything to resonate, so if we\u2019re holding on something, we give it twice as much time as we would before. Because the sound really fills it in, especially with the music, it\u2019s okay to hold onto something for a long time.\n\nPhoto: Adult Swim\n\nAre you influenced by film noir lighting techniques?\n\nYeah, absolutely. The noir lighting is some of the best and most interesting because they don\u2019t have color. They have black and white, so they make very graphic compositions in [movies] like The Third Man. We studied all that stuff tremendously. But because ours is graphic composition, it gets heightened. Noir is definitely a big inspiration.\n\nDo you draw any influences from silent cinema?\n\nNot so much. I was a big Buster Keaton fan, I like Charlie Chaplin to a degree, but no, that isn\u2019t where this stuff is coming from. This is my love of Sergio Leone films, from the pulp books like Robert E. Howard\u2019s Conan novels and Solomon Kane.\n\nLoneliness was a big theme in Samurai Jack. In Primal, the lead character loses his family in a brutal dinosaur attack. Is loneliness something you consciously want to explore in this story as well? If not, what themes did you have in mind?\n\nI wanted everything to relate back to the title. I wanted things in their most simplistic and raw form. You look at their normal way of survival \u2014 sleep, eat, hunt \u2014 and then you have this juxtaposition of these two characters having to survive together. They\u2019re equal in a way. They\u2019re both kind of beasts. We could have easily gone with a man and dog [vibe], where Fang has to listen to him all the time. It didn\u2019t feel right. This is a more interesting relationship.\n\nPhoto: Adult Swim\n\nHow did you establish the look of Primal\u2019s world? It\u2019s very different from Samurai Jack.\n\nOur number-one goal was grittiness. We wanted things to be very drawn, very detailed. We didn\u2019t want to just repeat Samurai Jack. There\u2019s still a sensibility we\u2019ll never get around \u2014 and it will hopefully all feel like our work \u2014 but we are trying to push ourselves to do something different. With this, we love the grittiness of illustrations from Frank Frazetta. We wanted to do something that iconic.\n\nChristian Schellewald, who does all our background drawings, he draws a very illustrative, almost Mobius kind of style. Scott Wills, who has been my production designer Samurai Jack and Clone Wars, he has a very unique color sensibility that\u2019s his own. Whenever you find people like that, you just want to grab onto them and hold on for dear life because they\u2019re going to elevate your work to more than you can imagine it to be. I\u2019m a fan of Astro Boy and thought, \u201cI can draw this manly, Astro Boy\u2013type style.\u201d As the world started to come together from Christian\u2019s drawings to Scott\u2019s color, I was like, \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t fit. He needs to be more mature, more bold, more gritty.\u201d\n\nWhat do you hope audiences take away from their journey with Primal?\n\nFun. [Laughs.] Brutality. Something different than they\u2019ve experienced before. Especially in today\u2019s landscape where there\u2019s so much programming, how do you stand out? How do you get people to tune in? You give them something different.", "description": "Samurai Jack creator Genndy Tartakovsky is responsible for modern TV\u2019s boldest animation, but his new show Primal is his most ambitious work yet.
