All I ever wanted to do was win.\n\n\"If I could take it all back I would. No one deserves for this to happen to them.\n\n\"I replay the fight over and over in my head thinking what if this never happened and why did it happen to you.\n\n(Image: USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\"I can\u2019t stop thinking about it myself. I prayed for you so many times and shed so many tears because I couldn\u2019t even imagine how my family and friends would feel.\n\n\"I see you everywhere I go and all I hear are wonderful things about you. I thought about quitting boxing but I know that\u2019s not what you would want.\n\n\"I know that you were a fighter at heart so I decided not to [retire] but to fight and win a world title because that\u2019s what you wanted, and that\u2019s what I want.\n\n\"I will use you as motivation every day and make sure I always leave it all in the ring every time. #ChampPatrickDay With Compassion, Charles Conwell\u201d", "description": "Conwell admitted he has thought about quitting boxing after Day suffered head injury in their fight", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images", "Usa Today Sports"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20638611.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Oleksandr-Usyk-v-Chazz-Witherspoon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
