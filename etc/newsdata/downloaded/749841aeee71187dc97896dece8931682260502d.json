Every time they monitored the behaviour of squirrels for three minutes.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

However, squirrels that were played bird chatter afterwards displayed fewer vigilance behaviours and returned to normal levels of watchfulness more quickly than those that did not hear bird calls after the hawk\u2019s call.\n\nThis suggests squirrels are able to tap into the casual chatter of many bird species as an indicator of safety, according to the paper published in the Plos One journal.\n\n\u201cRecognition of bird chatter as a sign of safety is likely adaptive, as squirrels that can safely reduce their vigilance level in the presence of bird chatter presumably are able to increase foraging success,\u201d researchers wrote in the paper.\n\nWhen many species are vulnerable to a common predator it is advantageous for individuals to recognise information provided by other species, the authors said.\n\nThey added: \u201cWe knew that squirrels eavesdropped on the alarm calls of some bird species, but we were excited to find that they also eavesdrop on non-alarm sounds that indicate the birds feel relatively safe. Perhaps in some circumstances, cues of safety could be as important as cues of danger.\u201d\n\nAnthropogenic noise levels could be a problem for conservation efforts as it might cover up these calls, they said.\n\n\u201cIf bird chatter were masked by anthropogenic noise, this publicly available safety cue could be lost to the network of eavesdroppers,\u201d they added. \u201cThe lack of safety signals might cause squirrels and other eavesdroppers to allocate more energy to vigilance behaviours and less towards foraging, potentially compromising fitness.\u201d", "description": "Grey squirrels eavesdrop on chattering birds to work out if danger has passed, according to a new study.\u00a0 When the creatures\u00a0hear birds sounding a predator call they freeze and look up or\u00a0flee, researchers from\u00a0Oberlin College in Ohio found.
