In its first recommendation under this category, the Commission argues that in order to prevent arbitrary arrest, Section 41 of the CrPC should be amended. The Commission suggests that Section 41 should make it mandatory for the Investigation Officer to record the reasons in the Case Diary and daily Diary Register, prior to making the arrest. The Section should be amended to also make it necessary for the Investigating Officer to obtain written approval by the Officer in Charge of the police station. These steps would go some way in checking the practice of arbitrary arrests.\n\nIn the second recommendation, it recommends amending Section 50 of the CrPC. This section asks the arresting authority to inform the arrestee in writing about the offence committed and the grounds of arresting. However, the language in which the notice is given to the arrestee must not necessarily be easy for the arrestee to understand. Every arrestee cannot be acquainted with the language known to the officials of the arresting authority. There have been a number of bitter experiences where the arresting officials handed over notices to semi-literate arrestees, written in the Queen\u2019s English or, more accurately, in Indian bureaucratic legalese. Hence, the Commission recommends the language of writing to be one that is conveniently understood by the arrestee. This is a commendable suggestion. Section 50 should necessarily be amended to make it mandatory for the arresting authority/officials to inform the arrestee in a written language that he/she best understands.\n\nThe third category of recommendations is on \u2018default or statutory bail and remand\u2019. The Commission discusses the underlying problems majorly in two Sections of the CrPC. It talks about the intricacies and complexities of Section 167.\n\nThe Court in State of Punjab v Mehar Singh and Ors. observed that in the absence of a special order of a Magistrate, the non-completion of an investigation is not to be deemed to be sufficient cause for the detention of an accused person. The Court further observed that the remand to custody may be granted for compelling reasons when it is shown in the application that there is good reason to believe that the accused can possibly point out or assist the police in analyzing and cracking the case. The Commission recommends considering the fact in the context of the remand by appropriate authorities and suggests that the accused should not be detained in the case when a special order of the Magistrate is absent and the investigation is non-complete. The mandatory consideration of this context by the arresting authority as well as the judiciary could be instrumental in preventing the arresting authorities to follow short-cuts and ensure relatively freer and fairer trial against the accused. Needless to add, the step would also check the power of arbitrary arrest by the arresting authorities.\n\nIn its second set of recommendations under the category of default or statutory bail and remand, the Commission recommends amending Section 309 of CrPC. It highlights loopholes existing in sub-section 309 (2) of CrPC, which deals with remand of the accused after cognizance of the offence has been taken by the court. Where the trial is adjourned or constantly delayed, the Court may remand the accused if he/ she is in custody. The provision nowhere mentions that the Magistrate may also release the person from custody. This creates the problem of suggesting that remand under the provision is a mandatory and also an exclusive outcome.\n\n28. The Court should consider a two-way approach in order to ensure that the accused is not taken on remand through improper means as well as in determining whether the accused should be released or remanded. It should consider the compelling need for the accused to remain in custody as well as the duration of undertrial detention undergone by him/ her. The Commission recommends that section 309 (2) be amended and an explanation be added that in case an accused is in custody and the trial is getting postponed/ adjourned, the Court shall release him/her on bail or remand the accused to further custody, for reasons to be recorded in writing.\n\nIn another observation on Section 309 of CrPC, the Commission highlights the problem of increasing number of pending cases and the consequent logjam. Expressing its concerns on Section 309(1), it directs that the trial should be held as expeditiously as possible \u2013 on a day-to-day basis when the examination of witnesses has once begun. The Commission argues that the Trial Courts are already overburdened and it would be nearly impossible for them to expeditiously dispose off trials by holding them on a day-to-day basis. We should not forget that the position is no better at the District and lower court levels. In December 2018, over 2.72 crore cases were pending as arrears, about 5,135 vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 22,677 existed in the lower judiciary and approx one third of all High Court judicial posts were vacant.\n\nThirdly, the Commission made recommendations in the category of \u2018conditions that may be imposed in bail\u2019. Under this category, the Commission talks about nuances of conditions imposed on bail. The category has rightly been dealt with by the Commission from an enhanced human rights perspective. The recommendations also try to check the powers of the authorities to impose restrictions on the accused that might affect his livelihood and day to day life while enlarged on bail. The Commission argues that \u201ca bail condition must not unreasonably violate the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe debate on conditions imposed on bail is an ongoing debate, dependent on a number of factors/facets and criteria. The challenge is to strike the ideal equilibrium between the sociological, psychological, criminological, socio-economical and judicial factors. Since ideal balances are difficult, if not impossible to achieve in real life, it is obvious that if errors are to be made or emphasis to be changed, they must err on the side of human liberty and human rights, encapsulating the fullness of all facets of those phrases.\n\nConsequently, the Commission rightly recommends: \u201cin determining whether the person is likely to abscond, the court should look at factors other than monetary considerations that may keep the person accused of an offence within the jurisdiction of the court, such as the presence of family, job, other roots in the community, etc. However, an accused person should not be denied bail only because he is a migrant in the city of arrest and does not have ties with the local community. The appearance of such a person may be enforced through other means, as for example through informing the police of the place of ordinary reference of the person \u2026\u201d\n\nFourthly, the Commission proposes modifying the Classification in Schedule I of IPC. The Indian Penal Code, as well as the Code of Criminal Procedures, are both characterised by high degrees of incoherence and inconsistency in offences committed and terms of imprisonment awarded to the offender. For example: According to Section 498-A of IPC, subjecting a married woman to cruelty is a Non-bailable offence, punishable with imprisonment of three years, whereas, according to Section 497, the offence of adultery is a Bailable offence, punishable with imprisonment up to five years and is Bailable. The classification of Bailable and Non-bailable offences as well as their relative seriousnesses (and consequent imprisonment) is frequently illogical and inconsistent. The Commission recommends that there should be consistency between the term of imprisonment for offences and their classification as Bailable or Non-Bailable.\n\nFifthly, the Commission makes recommendations regarding anticipatory bail. The Commission argues that the proviso in Section 438 on anticipatory bail must be retained, despite this being contrary to the recommendations of the 203rd Law Commission Report. The Commission argues that anticipatory bail must not only be granted cautiously, but must also be made operative for a limited period of time. Further, given the special position of Section 438 of CrPC and its potential for misuse, every order passed under the section must be accompanied with reasons for rejecting or granting anticipatory bail..\n\nThe Commission wants to treat anticipatory bail as an \u2018extraordinary privilege\u2019. It suggests the Courts exercise extreme caution in bestowing this privilege and not grant anticipatory bail in a mechanical or perfunctory manner. Nuanced and precise guidelines would ultimately have to be laid down by the apex court under Section 438 to reduce the penumbra of ambiguity surrounding the provision and to operationalise this wish of the Commission.\n\nSixthly, regarding economic offences, the Commission recommends that serious economic offences like the circulation of counterfeit currency, black money, customs offences, etc. have led to a need of change in approach towards grant/denial of bail in such serious offences. According to the Commission, there is a need to incorporate special provisions/statutes in CrPC for granting or refusing bail in serious economic offences. In addition, there is also a need for classifications of such offences in IPC. Economic offences involve a number of related factors that could be lethal for the society, market, and nation at large. The amount of money, nature of scam/offence, impact on market/society, etc. should be considered, according to the Commission, as the decisive factors in granting/rejecting bail to offenders.\n\nSeventhly, the Commission makes recommendations on bail reforms in special laws. It argues that since the offences dealt through special laws are serious and grave, the bail provisions be tough and stringent. It cites the example of The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (Statement of Objects and Reasons, The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Bill, 1988, seeking to amend the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985), Courts often grant bail on \u2018technical grounds\u2019. To deal with the serious crimes dealt with by the Act as also to uphold and maintain the integrity of the act, unconditional bails must not be granted under the Act.\n\nThe Commission highlights its concerns regarding bail in special laws related to terrorism and suggests that a higher standard of scrutiny must be exercised in granting bails in these cases. The frequency and repetitiveness of that particular type of offence must also be considered where such offences are alleged. The Commission recommends that the bail should be granted only if the bail authority is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify granting bail. Besides, factors like frequency of the offender, degree of offence, possible threats to the society, etc. should be considered by the bail authority while granting bail. The bail granting authority should only grant bail in case it is 100% sure that there won\u2019t be any possible threats from the accused in terrorism cases, after examining and assessing every possible consequence that could result as the outcome of granting bail to the offender.\n\nEighthly, the Commission recommends modification of Sections 436 and 436A of CrPC. It suggests that the language of the section be made clear and unambiguous to communicate that the bail under this section should not be trumped by imposing excessive or unfair sureties.\n\nNinthly, the Commission highlights the need for a central intelligence database and electronic tagging. The Contemporary world is one of big data and data analytics. The Commission argues that although criminal antecedents can be discovered through records of FIR and the like, the information is piecemeal and not easily accessible. It recommends that the technical architecture of the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) scheme could be improved and adapted and utilized through existing information on the criminal as well as existing criminal history. The Commission makes a number of recommendations including electronic tagging, electronic monitoring, improvisation and adaptation of the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS).\n\nThe lack of technical facilities like intelligent databases and electronic tagging has made investigating agencies/police turn to private companies and startups. A recent tech start-up solved more than 1,100 cases using data and artificial intelligence. The time to enhance state capacity and capability in such tech intensive areas came long ago and massive governmental resource allocation is urgently required to combat crime by judicious use of state of the art technology both prophylectically, punitively and as a regulatory measure. An excellent example of this approach to use of technology in bail jurisprudence is the use of devices like gps enabled anklets and similar tracking devices. Such measures ensure full supervision, control and surveillance, yet preserve the ideal balance between undertrial incarceration versus the felt needs of society, while also killing a third proverbial bird with the same stone viz. minimizing overcrowding in scarce jails. Western nations have achieved remarkable results in this regard. Ironically, governments have been very trigger happy and gung ho in misusing the same technology paradigm to ensure Orwellian state surveillance and intrusion while eschewing such modern aids to bail jurisprudence like anklets discussed above. An egregious example of overzealousness is the attempted creation of a Social Media Communication Hub by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for monitoring citizen activities and achieving indirect censorship and surveillance. As an appearing counsel in this case, I was very happy that eventually the government was compelled to withdraw this hare brained scheme.\n\nTenthly, the Commission makes recommendations on the public prosecutor and regarding victims. The Commission argues that \u2018the treatment of victims\u2019 should be one of the major principles that should govern bail jurisprudence. It suggests that in certain serious and grave offences, a \u2018Victim Impact Assessment\u2019 report should be submitted after consulting the victim. The Commission further recommends that the concerns of the victim along with the information on physical, mental and social impact of the crime and the impact bail may have on the victim should be stated in such report. Similarly, the Commission suggests the Prosecutorial Department follow the checklist model of the UK \u2013 which categorically provides all the relevant data required for prosecutorial discretion in granting bail to the accused.\n\nEleventhly, the Commission puts forward recommendations on pre-trial risk assessment of the defendant. Risk assessment constitutes a subset of risk management \u2013 the act of balancing the possible risks posed by the defendant and his/her constitutional rights. In the risk assessment process, the arrested accused is brought to the station where, after identification, booking, search, questioning, and fingerprinting, community ties are investigated along with a set of predetermined factors. If the defendant is found to be a good risk candidate (i.e., with low or nil risk of absconding) , the officer is authorized to release him with a personal bond with or without sureties. Additionally, this procedure saves substantial police, investigating authorities and Court time and optimises the operation of detention facilities.\n\nFurther, the Commission puts forward a list of factors to be considered when making a risk assessment. These include reasonable grounds for believing that he has committed the offence; nature and gravity of the offence charged; severity of the potential punishment if the trial results in conviction; the preponderance of evidence; the danger of absconding; prior convictions and other criminal antecedents.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the crux of bail reforms lies on the idea of balancing the human rights of the accused and ensuring the conviction of the offender through a free and fair trial. Hence, this is the area that needs to be emphasized the most. However, risk assessment, as well as risk management, is based on the discretion of the investigation agency. No modification to any section of the CrPC has been suggested by the Commission. Hence, the success of the recommendations is entirely dependant on the behavioral changes in the actions of the investigating agency and its officers, which is a highly unreal and almost unachievable expectation.\n\nIn its twelfth set of recommendations, the Commission deals with exceptions to bail laws. These recommendations try to emphasize a number of rights-respecting reforms in bail jurisprudence. The Commission argues that \u201cabsolute restriction on granting of bail would undermine the right to liberty of the person accused of an offence.\u201d It therefore recommends that the authorities must grant bail in a case where certain supervening and inexorable circumstances exist. It further recommends that the bail authorities should grant bail to the accused in case he/she is suffering from a serious ailment and requires specialized medical help, unavailable in the jail.\n\nIn the thirteenth and final category of recommendations, the Commission advocates improving prison infrastructure. Currently, 1,401 different kinds of jails in the country are catering to 4,19,623 detainees and under-trials. Indian prisons are overburdened and overcrowded by the ever-increasing weight of the inmate population. They have one of the highest, if not the highest, prison densities of the world. The Commission makes the obvious point that the rising crime rates, coupled with the over-crowding of prisons, underline the need to improve the existing prison infrastructure in the country. It suggests that reduction in the number of under-trials by granting them bail could be helpful and may serve the purpose. The Commission then argues and clarifies that such releases of under-trials should be subject to a number of factors including the facts and circumstances of the case, stage of the trial, investigation report, socio-economic conditions of the accused person and ability to secure bail..", "description": "Critical Analysis of the Recommendations of Law Commission\u2019s Report: The Law Commission made Recommendations to reform thirteen different areas of bail jurisprudence.
