It does not include the bulk of products that make up the bilateral trading relationship, notably autos from Japan and aircraft, liquefied propane gas and semiconductor manufacturing equipment from the United States.\n\n(See graphic on top U.S. exports to Japan https://tmsnrt.rs/2mnCbY9)\n\nMotor vehicles and parts, by far the largest Japanese export to the United States at $56 billion in 2018, were left out for a later phase of negotiations. Abe said Trump agreed not to impose threatened \"Section 232\" tariffs on Japanese cars and parts on national security grounds.\n\nJapan has no tariffs on cars and trucks from the United States, but U.S. automakers argue that most American cars are kept out by environmental and safety regulations, and Japan's currency policies that keep the yen low against the dollar.\n\nTPP would have eased Japan's regulatory barriers, but neither agreement contained any rules to combat currency manipulation - a stated goal of the U.S. Trade Representative's office.\n\n\n\n\n\nLESS THAN TPP jPO\n\nAmerica's rice growers won't benefit from the new bilateral trade deal, as tariffs and quotas on U.S. rice imported to Japan set in the early 1990s remain in place.\n\nUnder the TPP, Japan would have accepted 70,000 metric tons of American rice per year tariff-free under a U.S.-specific quota, but this was not included in the bilateral deal.\n\nTim Johnson, president and CEO of the California Rice Commission, said he hoped for a better deal in later phases of U.S.-Japan talks.\n\nBarley also will not get improved access in the trade deal, congressional aides said, as Japan did not expand its TPP-wide quota for the grain used widely in beer production.\n\nApart from the lack of improved access for butter and milk powder, exact details of cheese provisions in the U.S.-Japan deal are not yet known. TPP would have eliminated Japan's tariffs of up to 40 percent on U.S. cheese over 16 years, but dairy industry officials say they eventually expect to be on a par with TPP countries.\n\n\"We think it's probably 80% of what we would have gotten in TPP,\" said Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association.\n\nDocuments provided by the Japan's foreign ministry show that Japan did not grant any concessions for U.S. exports of sugar, chocolate or other confections. Tokyo's TPP-wide quotas for these products have gone to other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSIMILAR TO TPP", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has called his new trade deal with Japan a \"phenomenal\" victory for U.S. farmers.
