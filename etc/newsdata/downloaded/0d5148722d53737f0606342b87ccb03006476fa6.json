Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images; Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to wake up in the middle of the night to hear the Hound of the Baskervilles howling in the distance. It\u2019s another thing altogether when the beast is on your front porch sniffing and scratching at the door. That must be how U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter feels about the confirmation of a former colleague\u2019s bad intent toward his already imperiled career, as CBS News reports:\n\nFormer House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, who retired last year, is running for Congress once again.\n\nThe California Republican announced Thursday that he will campaign for the House seat currently occupied by Duncan Hunter, a GOP congressman who has been charged with misuse of campaign funds. Issa had launched an exploratory committee in late August, during which he said he received more than 2,400 letters and checks averaging $82 asking him to run.\n\n\u201cIn politics, when thousands respond to \u2018I\u2019m looking at this \u2026 I\u2019m exploring it,\u2019 you pay attention,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m dedicated to do that because I believe I have the history, the skills, the seniority and the capability to hit the ground running not just for this district, but for California. To help Republicans compete in what has become a very treacherous and difficult Congress and to retake the majority.\u201d\n\nOther than being an enthusiastic purveyor of right-wing conspiracy theories (most notably Benghazi!), Issa was probably best-known in Congress as its richest member. As you can imagine of someone under indictment for massive diversion of campaign funds to (alleged) personal uses ranging from overseas family vacations to the accoutrements of extramarital affairs to $37,000 in bounced check fees, Hunter isn\u2019t exactly raking in the dough. He\u2019s raised less than the Democrat, Ammar Campa-Najjar, he narrowly defeated in 2018 in his overwhelmingly Republican district. And his (and his wife\u2019s) corruption trial is currently scheduled for January, uncomfortably near next March\u2019s top-two primary. Having already attracted five Republican opponents even before Issa plunged in, Hunter\u2019s reelection prospects aren\u2019t great. Yes, Issa will be vulnerable to carpetbagger claims (though his old district is adjacent to Hunter\u2019s), and he has the plausible argument that Hunter\u2019s district is more hospitable to his brand of Republicanism than the one he abandoned last year (and which was subsequently won by Democrat Mike Levin in a landslide):\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be candid, when the district changed. I didn\u2019t fit the district, it became a very, very, if you will, moderate district. I\u2019ve been somebody that works with the Freedom Caucus \u2026 and my politics are conservative politics. Sometimes you have to ask, \u201cDo you fit the district?\u201d Issa said.\n\nBefore writing off Hunter, it should be observed that he proved himself to be an unscrupulous smear-master in 2018, insinuating that Campa-Najjar had terrorist connections on the basis of his grandfather\u2019s complicity in Palestinian attacks on Israelis long before the candidate\u2019s birth. Like Campa-Najjar, as it happens, Issa has an Arab-American father. Surely Team Hunter is fully aware that Issa is free to run for Congress again because his plans to take an executive-branch position hit a really big snag just last week (per the Washington Post):\n\nA Senate committee abruptly postponed a confirmation hearing Thursday for former Republican congressman Darrell Issa after his nomination to lead the U.S. Trade and Development Agency hit a snag over an issue in his FBI background check.\n\nThe postponement of Issa\u2019s hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee came after Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the top Democrat on the panel, raised concerns about an FBI background check conducted on Issa that, he said, might be \u201cproblematic and potentially disqualifying for Senate confirmation.\u201d He did not reveal the nature of the issue, and other committee members who have not seen the FBI report said they, too, wanted time to review the issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about a nominee\u2019s favorite color or where they had dinner,\u201d Menendez (N.J.) said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about serious issues that go to credibility and suitability for these positions.\u201d\n\nThere could be some ripe smear material there, and maybe even fire along with the smoke. But as I suggested when Issa first talked seriously about entering this race, Hunter might be better advised to strike a plea deal with the Feds that includes his resignation from Congress.", "description": "Embattled California congressman Duncan Hunter, who faces trial in January for massive diversion of campaign contributions for personal use, now faces a challenge from former colleague Darrell Issa and his huge storehouse of money.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/grub/2019/08/29/29-darrell-issa-duncan-hunter.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
