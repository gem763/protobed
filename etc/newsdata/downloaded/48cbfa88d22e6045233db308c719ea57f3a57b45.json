In many cases, patients have also acknowledged recent use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing e-cigarette products while speaking to healthcare personnel or in follow-up interviews by health department staff.\"\n\n\"States are completing their own investigations and verifications of cases based on CDC\u2019s recently released standardized case definition,\" the CDC continued.\n\nAside from the ongoing investigation, the CDC warned that e-cigarette products \"should not be used by youth, young adults, pregnant women, as well as adults who do not currently use tobacco products.\"\n\nVaping has become a nationwide issue in recent years and the fallout is continuing. Last month, a Utah teen who had spent years performing vaping tricks and testing out new products urged others to put the pens down after she landed in the hospital in a coma with a rare lung disorder.\n\n\u201cI had fat particles growing inside my lungs that were related to the glycerin in vape juice,\u201d Maddie Nelson, 18, told Fox 13 Now. \u201cSo then my lungs were full of fluid. They said that my chest X-rays were one of the worst they\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNelson was admitted to a local hospital in Payson in late July after several months of mild symptoms turned into a fever and vomiting. She was eventually transferred to Timpanagos Regional Hospital where she was admitted to the intensive care unit and placed in a medically induced coma for three days, according to Fox 13 Now.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Alexandria Hein contributed to this report.", "description": "Public health officials are warning against using e-cigarettes and other vaping products after a surge in mysterious respiratory illnesses that have been linked back to vaping.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ContentBroker_contentid-bd31df4dae8b48a1b4dc475af12b34fe.png"}
