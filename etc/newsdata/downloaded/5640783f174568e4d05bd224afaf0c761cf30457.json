The frigate trained its deck guns on the Iranian gunboats while issuing verbal warnings.\n\nThe British warship is armed with two 30 mm guns that are designed for repelling small fast-moving watercraft. The IRGC vessels departed without incident.\n\nRead more: Iranian gunboats backed away in a showdown with a Royal Navy frigate after staring down the barrel of the 'perfect weapon'\n\nhms montrose More\n\nMick Storey/Royal Navy/Handout via Reuters\n\nA week later, the UK-flagged Stena Impero, which was sailing unescorted, was seized by the IRGC. HMS Montrose tried to come to the ship's aid, but it arrived too late.\n\nThe ship is tasked with escorting British-flagged ships through the contested strait to deter Iran forces, which haven't seized a UK-flagged ship since July 19 when the Stena Impero was taken.\n\nThe Iranians have repeatedly mocked the Type 23 frigate for failing to save the Stena Impero, which remains in Iranian custody, The Times reported. In addition to taunts, the Iranians have also routinely sent out gunboats and unmanned air assets to \"intimidate\" the British warship by approaching to within 200 meters. A reporter for The Times personally witnessed some of these activities reporting aboard HMS Montrose.\n\nIranian forces have even targeted the ship with coastal defenses and cruise missiles, according to the frigate's captain.\n\nToward the end of July, the US launched a multinational maritime security effort known as Operational Sentinel. This operation is intended to \"increase surveillance of and security in key waterways in the Middle East,\" US Central Command revealed at the time.\n\nThe move followed a string of attacks on commercial shipping vessels, the downing of a US drone, and the seizure of a tanker flying the British Union Jack \u2014 all actions attributed to Iran.\n\nThe Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose and the destroyer HMS Duncan were the first British warships to join this mission. The frigate HMS Kent was deployed to the Gulf in mid-August, and recently, the Type 45 destroyer HMS Defender was sent to replace the Duncan.\n\nNOW WATCH: We went inside Border Patrol boot camp and found the Academy isn't training agents for the job the White House is asking them to do", "description": "The Royal Navy frigate has reportedly had 115 run-ins with Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf since the start of July, and it's not backing down.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tCLJL_xmkwpyP1GU.O394Q--~B/aD04MTA7dz0xNjIwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/9f7ec7010f0edf50d8921dda41902a67"}
