Because if you do, I believe you will be impeached,\u201d Kelly explained.\n\nLooking back in retrospect, Kelly said he regrets resigning when he did. He believes that if he would have stayed, Democrats would not have launched an impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\n\u201cThat was almost 11 months ago, and I have an awful lot of, to say the least, second thoughts about leaving,\u201d Kelly said, clearly referencing his replacement, Mike Mulvaney. \u201cIt pains me to see what\u2019s going on because I believe if I was still there or someone like me was there, he would not be kind of, all over the place.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kelly, the Democrats' impeachment into Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could have been avoided if someone kept Trump in check.\n\n\u201cSomeone has got to be a guide that tells [the president] that you either have the authority or you don\u2019t, or Mr. President, don\u2019t do it,\u201d the former White House official said. \u201cDon\u2019t hire someone that will just nod and say, \u2018That\u2019s a great idea Mr. President.\u2019 Because you will be impeached.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe system that should be in place, clearly \u2014 the system of advising, bringing in experts in, having these discussions with the president so he can make an informed decision, that clearly is not in place. And I feel bad that I left.\u201d", "description": "Yikes..10/26/2019 20:01:32PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/116/b354c2a2-3199-43d4-88e4-17413211b524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
