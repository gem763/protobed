Instead, he couldn\u2019t move his arm and his wife had to help dress him.\n\nScherzer was scratched from game five of the World Series against Houston due to muscles spasms in his neck and back that left him struggling to do simple tasks much less throw 100-mph pitches.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as disappointed as I could possibly be,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\n\u201cThe nerve that\u2019s in the neck was all jammed up. It became impossible for me to do any menial task today. I can\u2019t pick up my arm right now so I can\u2019t pitch.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old right-hander won game one of the best-of-seven Major League Baseball final and his absence left the Nationals at a major disadvantage with the series deadlocked 2-2.\n\n\u201cThis is the most severe one of all time,\u201d Scherzer said when asked to compare his injuries. \u201cThis is just a little thing that turned into a big thing that turned into giant thing.\n\n\u201cThe moment I woke up it really hurt to get out of bed. I basically had to fall out of bed. I couldn\u2019t even move my arm. I knew at that moment I was in a pretty bad spot.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even dress myself. I had to have my wife help me.\u201d\n\nScherzer went 11-7 with a 2.92 earned-run average and led all major league pitchers with 7.364 strikeouts for every walk issued this season.\n\nScherzer made his seventh consecutive All-Star Game appearance this year. He\u2019s a three-time winner of the Cy Young Award as top pitcher and a three-time National League strikeouts leader.\n\nWhile Scherzer had been on the injured list in July with a strained back muscle, he said the new injury was unrelated to the earlier one, the spasms starting on Friday as he began preparing for his start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had neck spasms in the past and know how to get through them. Came in and got treatment and didn\u2019t feel quite right,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI thought we found a way to ease the spasms. I was able to play catch. When I woke up this morning I was completely locked up. The nerve that\u2019s in the neck was all jammed up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pitched through so much crap in my career\u2026 this is impossible to do anything with.\u201d\n\nScheduled game six starter Stephen Strasburg, 4-0 in the playoffs, will remain set for Tuesday\u2019s contest in Houston, Nationals manager Dave Martinez said, with Scherzer possible if healthy for a seventh game start Wednesday if necessary.\n\n\u201cAs of right now I\u2019d leave Stephen starting game six,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIf we get to game seven, Max starts game seven.\u201d\n\nScherzer hopes an injection to ease the spasms and tightness within 48 hours will work and allow him to be ready for a seventh game if needed.\n\n\u201cThe doctors told me it would take at least 48 hours for the injection to kick in,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the doctors believe, it\u2019s just nerve irritation.\n\n\u201cNext 48 hours can really decide. I\u2019m just hoping the doctors are right and something could be possible for game seven.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Got to be pretty bad\u2019 \u2013\n\nJoe Ross, who has thrown only two innings in one game with one hit allowed during Washington\u2019s shock playoff run, was named the game-five starter. He went 4-4 in 27 appearances this season.\n\n\u201cIn our clubhouse we always believe the next guy up can get the job done,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cIn this case it\u2019s Joe.\u201d\n\nHouston\u2019s Justin Verlander, the game two loser and scheduled game six starter, was a former teammate of Scherzer in Detroit.\n\n\u201cIt has got to be pretty bad,\u201d said Verlander. \u201cHe\u2019s a competitor, always wanted to have the ball. Given the situation, I assume it\u2019s not good.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Washington Nationals star Max Scherzer was planning to pitch the biggest game of his baseball career Sunday.
