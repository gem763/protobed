Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the big winner Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also delivered strong performances.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and the other eight candidates on stage came out the losers in the three-hour Democratic presidential primary debate.\n\nBIGGEST WINNER: Elizabeth Warren\n\nWarren\u2019s strong performance will likely solidify her frontrunner status ahead of Biden and Sanders. She emerged the clear winner of the night by showing she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead.\n\nWARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES\n\nEven during the heated exchanges over health care and a wealth tax, Warren was able to turn attacks leveled against her around, and still deliver the best answers of the evening.\n\nWarren questioned why the other candidates \u201cthink it is more important to protect billionaires than to invest in Americans\u201d when responding to an attack on her plan for a wealth tax.\n\nAnd importantly, Warren remained the focal point of the debate, speaking for the most amount of time of all of the candidates.\n\nThe senator from Massachusetts now has unmatched fundraising and polling momentum, along with a series of strong debate performances. This, coupled with the fact that Biden and Sanders have been weakened in dissimilar but debilitating ways recently, almost guarantees that Warren will take over as the front-runner.\n\nSURPRISE WINNER: Bernie Sanders\n\nSanders has faced a precipitous decline in the most recent polls given the significant questions about his health and stamina following his recent heart attack.\n\nHowever, Sanders delivered a strong, forceful performance in the debate, succeeding in showing voters that he has not lost a step, making him the second-place finisher of the night.\n\nBut it is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.\n\nIt is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.\n\nSURPRISE WINNER: Pete Buttigieg\n\nButtigieg has been called the breakout star of the Democratic field \u2013 though he has recently struggled to distinguish himself. He had several strong moments in the Tuesday night debate. He was able to make a compelling case as a young, center-left candidate from a swing state with a military background.\n\nButtigieg was particularly strong during a tense exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, delivering a response that elicited cheers from the audience.\n\n\u201cRespectfully congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it's a consequence of a withdrawal and betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Buttigieg\u2019s performance will likely result in a post-debate polling bump with moderate voters, especially given Biden\u2019s relatively weak debate performance.\n\nLOSERS\n\nBIGGEST LOSER: Joe Biden\n\nAll eyes, particularly those of Democratic leaders, strategists, and donors were on Biden, who needed deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump.\n\nHowever, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son\u2019s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWith each passing day, Biden seems to move further from securing the Democratic presidential nomination, and his unimpressive performance Tuesday night will likely result in a post-debate polling decline.\n\nLOSER: Amy Klobuchar\n\nAdditionally, although Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had a number of well-executed lines taking aim at Warren, many felt similar to the inconsequential attacks leveled against Warren by former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland during the first debate. Thus, Klobuchar\u2019s performance is unlikely to result in the post-debate polling spike her campaign needed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET FOX NEWS APP\n\nLOSER: Kamala Harris\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California similarly fell short, as she failed to distinguish herself in any meaningful way at a time when her campaign desperately needs a boost. Given that recent polls have her hoovering at around 5 percent, she will likely not be able to regain the momentum she had just over two months ago.\n\nLOSERS: Gabbard, Castro, Steyer, Booker, O\u2019Rourke and Yang\n\nThe remaining candidates \u2013 all barely registering in polls \u2013 were the biggest losers of the night. Rep. Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and entrepreneur Andrew Yang failed to have the breakout moment they all desperately needed to show voters they could defeat Trump in November 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DOUG SCHOEN", "description": "At Tuesday night's debate, all eyes, particularly those of Democratic leaders, strategists, and donors were on Biden, who needed deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump.", "authors": ["Douglas Schoen", "Douglas E.
