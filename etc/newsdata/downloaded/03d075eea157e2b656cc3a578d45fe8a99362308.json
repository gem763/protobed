I\u2019m really looking forward to getting back in around the Aussie team,\u201d Hussey, who is nicknamed \u201cMr Cricket\u201d, told the Sydney Daily Telegraph on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThey are going to be trying to get strategies in place, develop a style of play and what players they want and I love all that stuff \u2014 planning for a big event.\n\n\u201cThey have floated the possibility of being involved closer to the T20 World Cup (in Australia next year) as well but it\u2019s all pretty loose at the moment.\u201d\n\nAustralia play back-to-back three-game T20 series against Sri Lanka and then Pakistan starting next Sunday in Adelaide to kick off their summer season.\n\nLanger has also made former Test speedster Ryan Harris bowling coach for the series.\n\nHe told the newspaper the presence of Ponting, Waugh and now Hussey was enormous for his team.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how influential these guys can be on the group,\u201d said Langer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have different voices and different eyes and see guys of that calibre giving us feedback on what they see.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Former middle-order batsman Mike Hussey has been drafted in by Australian coach Justin Langer to help mentor the side during their upcoming Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ehs1a0jw4aagmgx-1571572207136.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
