She would like to see more subsidized apprenticeships, but Grant says she doesn't hear that being promised by political leaders.\n\n\"I don't know if it's worth my time [to vote],\" she said.\n\nAfter hearing from Grant and Hamdan, All In A Day reached out to the four major federal parties to hear their responses.\n\nClick below to hear what local candidates from the Liberals, Greens and NDP had to say.
