It was pleasing that we did put things right later on in the game and finishing with a couple of tries made it a nicer win than it probably was.\u201d\n\nLess satisfying were a number of injuries - with Jonny Gray, Ben Toolis, Kinghorn, Jamie Ritchie and Blade Thomson all suffering.\n\n\u201cWe had two players with head injuries and they didn\u2019t come back on, they\u2019ll go through the normal concussion protocols,\u201d Townsend said.\n\n\u201cA couple of guys had tight hamstrings. Jamie Ritchie\u2019s going to the hospital for a scan later tonight, so that\u2019s five players in a match so there will be quite a lot to look at over the next few days.\u201d\n\nScotland have a tough start to their World Cup campaign as they face Pool A favourites Ireland in their opening game.\n\nGeorgia open up against Wales in Pool D, which also contains Australia.", "description": "Scotland completed their Rugby World Cup campaign with a second successive victory over Georgia on Friday but found things tougher going this week before a late surge secured a somewhat flattering 36-9 victory at Murrayfield.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427067341&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8522Z", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
