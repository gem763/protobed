The story is attributed to \"three people familiar with the testimony\" and it later goes on to caution:\n\nThe testimony by Kent offers a reminder that as Democrats probe President Trump\u2019s alleged actions in pressuring Ukraine to dig up compromising information on Biden, the impeachment inquiry also threatens to keep alive questions about the former vice president\u2019s handling of his son\u2019s foreign work at a precarious moment for his 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nIn other words, thank the Lord, we can Both Sides this sucker at last.\n\nBear in mind\u2014if the folks at Camp Runamuck had not bungled their way into admitting to several felonies and impeachable offenses, brother Kent would still be out there happily carrying out the idiotic non-policies cooked up by El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago that have sold out the national interest and lit a good part of the world on fire. Moreover, I think it's safe to assume that the People Familiar With The Testimony are either Republican congresscritters or Republican staffers. If that is the case, then the Post has a responsibility to let its readers know that fact since this is clearly going to be the White House defense strategy going forward.\n\nNo names, of course. But \"Republican sources familiar with the testimony\" would be perfectly inbounds. (Come to think of it, if the sources are Democrats, that's a helluva story, too.) Anonymity is one thing. Strategic camouflage is another, and no journalist is bound to provide the latter. That's how everybody got in trouble with Whitewater. And it's not like it's an impossible thing to do. In fact, later in the story, an anonymous source is identified as, \"a former senior Biden national security adviser,\" which lends credibility to offset a reader's skepticism as regards anonymous sources.\n\nPhoto credit: ERIC BARADAT - Getty Images More\n\nAnd this section here is just complete manure.\n\nAlthough many of Trump\u2019s charges regarding Hunter Biden have been unfounded, the elder Biden has faced questions about why he didn\u2019t anticipate concerns about potential conflicts of interest as he took a leading role in carrying out U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Polls show Biden with an advantage over Trump in a potential general election matchup, and Biden has sought in recent days to focus attention on the actions of a president many Democrats see as corrupt and unfit for office.\n\nHere, in the context of a political campaign, in which, I guess, empirical facts are not altogether necessary, we are comparing something that the president* actually did, and something that his chief-of-staff copped to on Thursday, to \"unfounded\" charges and \"questions\" about why the elder Biden \"didn't anticipate concerns.\" Can the shadows and the clouds be far behind? And then there's this:\n\nTrump and his allies have made the unsubstantiated claim that Biden pressed for the prosecutor\u2019s firing to protect his son. In fact, according to former U.S. officials and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, the investigation of Burisma was dormant at the time. And Biden, adding to the calls from others in the U.S. government and Western institutions, was urging Ukraine to tap a new prosecutor who would be more aggressive in combating corruption.", "description": "This 'Washington Post' story on George Kent and Hunter Biden reeks of both-siderism.", "authors": ["Charles P.
