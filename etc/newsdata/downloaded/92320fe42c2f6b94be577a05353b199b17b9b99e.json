(RAHIMULLAH YOUSAFZAI/AP)\n\nThe U.S. commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden was guided from space by a fleet of satellites, which aimed dozens of receivers over Pakistan to collect a torrent of electronic and signals intelligence as the mission unfolded, according to a top-secret U.S. intelligence document.\n\nThe National Security Agency also was able to penetrate guarded communications among al-Qaeda operatives by tracking calls from mobile phones identified by specific calling patterns, the document shows. Analysts from the CIA pinpointed the geographic location of one of the phones and linked it to the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where other evidence suggested bin Laden was hiding.\n\nThe disclosures about the hunt for the elusive founder of al-Qaeda are contained in classified documents that detail the fiscal 2013 \u201cblack budget\u201d for U.S. intelligence agencies, including the NSA and the CIA. The documents, provided to The Washington Post by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, make only brief references to the bin Laden operation. But the mission is portrayed as a singular example of counterterrorism cooperation among the U.S. government\u2019s numerous intelligence agencies.\n\nEight hours after the raid, according to the documents, a forensic intelligence laboratory run by the Defense Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan had analyzed DNA from bin Laden\u2019s corpse and \u201cprovided a conclusive match\u201d confirming his identity. The budget further reveals that satellites operated by the National Reconnaissance Office performed more than 387 \u201ccollects\u201d of high-resolution and infrared images of the Abbottabad compound in the month before the raid \u2014 intelligence that was \u201ccritical to prepare for the mission and contributed to the decision to approve execution.\u201d\n\nAlso playing a role in the search for bin Laden was an arm of the NSA known as the Tailored Access Operations group. Among other functions, the group specializes in surreptitiously installing spyware and tracking devices on targeted computers and mobile-phone networks.\n\nAlthough the budget does not provide detail, it reports that Tailored Access Operations \u201cimplants\u201d enabled the NSA to collect intelligence from mobile phones that were used by al-Qaeda operatives and other \u201cpersons of interest\u201d in the hunt for bin Laden.\n\nSeparately, Tailored Access Operations capabilities were used in April 2011, the month before bin Laden was killed, when U.S. forces in Afghanistan relied on signals intelligence from implants to capture 40 low- and mid-level Taliban fighters and other insurgents in that country, according to the documents.\n\nThe new details about the raid fill out an already rich public account of how the U.S. government employed virtually every tool in its enormous surveillance apparatus to locate bin Laden. For more than a decade, bin Laden had stymied all efforts to find him by making certain he did not leave a direct electronic trail. He steadfastly avoided phones and e-mail, relying on face-to-face communications with a few couriers and middlemen.\n\nIn addition to the satellites, the government flew an advanced stealth drone, the RQ-170, over Pakistan to eavesdrop on electronic transmissions. The CIA also recruited a Pakistani doctor and other public health workers to try to obtain blood samples from people living in the Abbottabad compound as part of a vaccination program to determine whether the residents might be related to bin Laden.\n\nThat doctor was convicted by a Pakistani court in May 2012 of \u201cconspiring against the state.\u201d A senior judicial official on Thursday overturned the 33-year prison sentence for Shakil Afridi on technical grounds and ordered a retrial.\n\nFor all their technological prowess, U.S. spy agencies were unable to identify bin Laden with confidence inside the Abbottabad compound. By the time President Obama ordered a team of Navy SEALs to storm the site in May 2011, U.S. intelligence officials told the president that, according to their best guesses, the odds that bin Laden was present were 40 percent to 60 percent.\n\nEven after bin Laden\u2019s death, the U.S. government kept up its relentless high-tech campaign to unlock his secrets.\n\nBudget documents show that intelligence agencies scraped together $2.5 million in emergency money in September 2011 to sift through a backlog of computer files and other evidence recovered from bin Laden\u2019s hideout. The money went to buy 36 computer workstations and pay overtime to forensic examiners, linguists and \u201ctriage personnel\u201d involved in the project.", "description": "Satellites aimed dozens of separate receivers over Pakistan to collect intelligence as the mission unfolded.", "authors": ["Craig Whitlock", "Investigative Reporter", "Barton Gellman", "August"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/05/02/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Bin_Laden_0f745-859.jpg?t=20170517", "published_at": "2013-08-29"}
