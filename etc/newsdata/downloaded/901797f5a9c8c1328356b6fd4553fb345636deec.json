At the very end they glared at each other, not quite done yet and had to be separated before their weary bodies were hoisted high by sweaty handlers to receive their praise. The fight was over, but not finished \u2013 the first judge had it even, 114-114 after such suffering and then the final two went 115-113 and 117-112, the last score was too wide, and then as Michael Buffer, the ancient saint of the microphone, adjusted his regal chops, he delivered the sweetest sound to Taylor\u2019s ears and broke the fighting heart of Prograis.\n\nThey embraced, respect at last. \u201cThe best man won tonight, it was a helluva fight,\u201d said Prograis. It was his first loss in 25 fights; Taylor is now unbeaten in 16.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He also had, he joked, a fake Lacoste belt he once bought in Tenerife.\n\nThere was no set pattern to this brilliance, no simple adjustment that turned the classic in one boxer\u2019s favour. All rounds were 180-second epics, full stories in three breathless minutes and at each bell the men stirred from their breaks and went back to work like the devoted artists they are. It was exhausting to watch from my seat deep in the utter-delight section, just six feet from the ring canvas.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (17-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion has successfully moved up in weight, beating Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nPrograis took an early lead, his speed exceptional and after three rounds he looked like he was enjoying himself, perhaps he could hear the endless praise in his ears. However, Taylor won the fourth but seemed flat-out, at full pace and that looked ominous so early \u2013 luckily it was a tiny deception. After six rounds I had the fight 3-3, the 50-50 fight was sweetly on track. At the end of the sixth there was just a bit of raw panic in the Prograis corner: \u201cYou can\u2019t give up the rounds,\u201d urged Bobby Benton, his friend and coach. They shared a round each, entered the ninth with my card fixed at 4-4; it was relentless, both fierce and masterful, far more than a slugfest.\n\nTaylor\u2019s right eye had started to swell and close by the 11th round, but I had him edging in front, refusing to obey any established form guides. Prograis had blood smeared from his nose, mouth and a nick over his right eye across his swollen face. In round 11 the damaged right eye \u2013 Taylor had not been able to see clearly out of the right eye for two rounds \u2013 split, an ugly two-inch gash that filled his cheek with dark, dark blood. There was no panic at this late crisis and in his corner the veteran\u2019s veteran, Jimmy Tibbs, silently went to work to contain the wound with his magic.\n\nA dozen sets of eyes could never fully capture the drama of fights like this at that moment when the hope, despair, dreams, tears and fears of all involve combine; it is one of sport\u2019s most unforgettable passages. They rose, blood sticking to their bodies, on weary legs for the last and then it was back to work, the final words of their corners deaf to their ears as the howls of 18,000 witnesses lifted them.\n\nPrograis just won the last, just finished on top, but the fight had narrowly slipped from his fists before the round started. They had nothing left at the end but their defiance, they stood and even in the uneasy calm of a finished fight they refused to back down, refused to look away. It was unforgettable stuff, an end that plays over in mind now with a Rocky anthem booming.\n\nThe O2\u2019s position as the home of boxing was enhanced by the delights of this sensational match, a fight so pure in its conception and deliverance that nobody witness to the brutal craft of both will ever forget where they were when the first and last bells sounded.\n\nWe all had our privilege card stamped on Saturday night, in the guiltiest of pleasures my old trade can deliver: two unbeaten men fighting with every ounce of their souls to avoid the unknown, to win at all cost.\n\nIf they ever fought a rematch \u2013 fights like this have to be measured long beyond the financial gains and any persuasive deceptions of ring honour \u2013 they will each need to calculate simply the short and long-term health risks; fights like this can shorten more than careers. They made sacrifices for their pride and respect on Saturday night and our pleasure.
