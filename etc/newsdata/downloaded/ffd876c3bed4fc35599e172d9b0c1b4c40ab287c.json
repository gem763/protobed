You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt is unusual for a serving cabinet minister to announce that they will retire from parliament.\n\nThe decision follows a number of other \u201cOne Nation\u201d Conservatives announcing that they will leave parliament at the 12 December election. Earlier on Wednesday, Amber Rudd, the former home secretary, and David Lidington, the former deputy prime minister, both said they would not be seeking re-election.\n\nMs Morgan said she had \u201cmade the very difficult decision that I can\u2019t commit to another five-year term\u201d and that \u201cnow is the time for me to stand aside and be at home far more\u201d.\n\nIn a letter to the chair of her constituency party, she said serving as an MP had been \u201cthe greatest privilege of my life\u201d but added: \u201cThe clear impact on my family and other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job of a modern MP can only be justified if, ultimately, parliament does what it is supposed to \u2013 represent those we serve in all areas of policy, respect votes cast by th electorate and make decisions in the overall national interest.\u201d\n\nFirst elected in 2010, Ms Morgan served as education secretary in David Cameron\u2019s government but was sacked by Theresa May in 2016 and became chair of the influential House of Commons Treasury Select Committee.\n\nShe initially supported Michael Gove during the Tory leadership contest but, alongside Ms Rudd, became one of the most prominent members of the One Nation group of Tory MPs to agree to serve in Mr Johnson\u2019s government.\n\nMs Morgan backed Remain during the 2016 referendum but later became a prominent advocate of the need to deliver Brexit, including leading efforts to find an alternative to the controversial Northern Ireland backstop in an attempt to secure MPs\u2019 support for an exit deal.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
