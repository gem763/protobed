All it says is \u2018Bob Marley 1945-1981, Singer and Songwriter, lived here in 1977\u2019.\n\nIn a way, that\u2019s all it needs to say. Most people know that the reggae legend, neck-and-neck with Usain Bolt as the most famous Jamaican of all time, crammed an awful lot of life into his 36 years. Yet there are a thousand stories behind that English Heritage plaque, many of which involve sex, drugs and wild, decadent excess.\n\nOddly enough, those that don\u2019t are even more fascinating. Marley had moved to London because he was in mortal danger on his native island. Although he preached reconciliation and love, and tried boldly to unite Jamaica\u2019s warring factions, in December 1976 gunmen burst into his Kingston home and attempted to murder him, quite possibly on the orders of the CIA, who wanted to destabilise a country they feared was becoming another Cuba under its socialist leader, Michael Manley.\n\nReggae musician Bob Marley (1945-1981) was recently honoured with a blue plaque on a handsome house in Chelsea where he lived in 1977 after moving to London from Jamaica\n\nNothing like that seemed likely to happen in or around 42 Oakley Street. Marley loved London. He loved to play football just across the River Thames in Battersea Park, with friends including fellow reggae star Eddy Grant\n\nMarley left Jamaica out of fears for his safety, after gunmen broke into his home and fired bullets, some of which hit his wife Rita (pictured) and manager Don Taylor. Marley was wounded in the arm, and miraculously, nobody died\n\nFive of the bullets intended for Marley struck his manager, Don Taylor. Another hit his wife, Rita, in the head. Marley was wounded in the arm. Miraculously, nobody died, even though, in a deafening fusillade, more than 80 bullets were fired.\n\nNothing like that seemed likely to happen in or around 42 Oakley Street. Marley loved London. He loved to play football just across the River Thames in Battersea Park, with friends including fellow reggae star Eddy Grant. He especially loved living in a country where neither policemen nor criminals carried guns.\n\nFeeling safe, indeed so safe that right under Rita\u2019s nose he contentedly carried on an affair with the reigning Miss World, his fellow-Jamaican Cindy Breakspeare, Marley enjoyed one of the most creative years of his short life while living in England. He and his band, the Wailers, recorded their classic Exodus album, which Time magazine would later anoint as its \u2018album of the century\u2019.\n\n\u2018This tough, edgy, militant soldier could actually write the softest, most beautiful love songs, infused with pearls of wisdom and bits of scripture so profound they made you weak at the knees and pricked your conscience all at the same time,\u2019 Breakspeare later recalled.\n\nShe was seduced in body as well as mind. Their son Damian was conceived during their stay in London, one of at least seven children Marley is believed to have fathered with seven different women, not to mention the four he had with wife Rita.\n\nMind you, that seems monastic compared with one of his Wailers, the wryly nicknamed Aston \u2018Family Man\u2019 Barrett, who at the latest count was a father of 52. Maybe it was the need to pay child support that explains why in 2006 he sued Marley\u2019s estate for \u00a360 million in unpaid royalties. His challenge was unsuccessful.\n\nHis ganja habit is the reason why it has taken so long for English Heritage to verify that he lived in Oakley Street, because when in March 1977 he was arrested for possession of drugs, the address he gave to the police was Collingham Gardens, in Kensington\n\nFeeling safe, indeed so safe that right under Rita\u2019s nose he contentedly carried on an affair with the reigning Miss World, his fellow half-Jamaican Cindy Breakspeare (pictured)\n\nUpmarket Chelsea was a long way, in more ways than one, from down-at-heel Trenchtown, the tough neighbourhood of Kingston Marley came from, which is immortalised in his great song of the same name\n\nBreakspeare\u2019s affair with Marley, which she claims to have embarked on without any idea that he was married, had started before he moved to London. But it was in Oakley Street that it gathered momentum, with her still allegedly unaware of his connection with Rita, even though his wife of more than a decade was staying just round the corner and was one of his trio of backing singers, the I-Threes.\n\nDespite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 the industrial quantities of marijuana that were smoked at the house, not to mention all the extra-marital sex, Breakspeare recalls their nine months or so there as an exercise in domestic bliss.\n\n\u2018I have wonderful memories of us cooking at 3am and taking long soaks in a hot tub to get the chill out of our bones,\u2019 she said.\n\nHer son Damian, just a toddler when his father died, now runs a huge cannabis farm in California. It\u2019s safe to say that the old man would be proud. Marley was almost always shrouded in a fug of marijuana, not only because it was part of his Rastafarian creed (the Rastas believed that \u2018ganja\u2019, as they called it, was a sacramental herb that promoted self-knowledge) but also because, well, he adored it.\n\nHis ganja habit is the reason why it has taken so long for English Heritage to verify that he lived in Oakley Street, because when in March 1977 he was arrested for possession of drugs, the address he gave to the police was Collingham Gardens, in Kensington. It was a lie. He just didn\u2019t want them searching his house, knowing how much illicit produce he had stashed there.\n\nPoet Benjamin Zephaniah unveils an English Heritage blue plague for Bob Marley, at his home on Oakley Street in Chelsea near to the Albert Bridge\n\nUpmarket Chelsea was a long way, in more ways than one, from down-at-heel Trenchtown, the tough neighbourhood of Kingston Marley came from, which is immortalised in his great song of the same name.\n\n\u2018Say Trench \u2026 Trenchtown \u2026 we\u2019re the underprivileged people / So Trenchtown, they keep us in chains,\u2019 he sang.\n\nYet even in Kingston he had already moved well away from Trenchtown, living in some grandeur at 56 Hope Road, the same street as the Prime Minister. In a Netflix documentary about the assassination attempt on Marley, a friend recalls teasing him about his move to such a swish area, when so many of his songs expressed solidarity with Jamaica\u2019s dirt-poor. He just smiled. \u2018No, I\u2019m bringing the ghetto uptown,\u2019 he said.\n\nGrowing up in Trenchtown in the Fifties, Marley had a street name, Tuff Gong, and a no-nonsense reputation. He was an only child, which meant more room than most families enjoyed in corrugated-metal shacks. His father was a white man, Norval Marley, who had seduced his mother, Cedella, when she was just 17, having promised to marry her. Norval went through with his promise, but abandoned her the very next day.\n\nAs a mixed-race child, life could have been even tougher for Marley than for most kids in Trenchtown, but he was strong and smart enough to turn it to his advantage.\n\nEven once he became the world\u2019s most famous reggae artist on the back of songs about the dispossessed, he never espoused hatred for white people. Indeed, he tried as hard as he could to stay politically neutral, until Manley worked out a way of exploiting him for the benefit of his People\u2019s National Party.\n\nBack in his teen years, Marley confounded Cedella\u2019s greatest fear, that he would turn to a life of crime.\n\nInstead, he threw himself into ska music, Jamaica\u2019s answer to rhythm and blues, from which reggae would evolve. He formed a band and wasn\u2019t averse to performing covers of commercial Sixties pop songs, such as Sugar Sugar, and What\u2019s New Pussycat?, but his breakthrough was as a lyricist. He wrote a song called Simmer Down, set to an aggressive beat yet with pacific lyrics, pleading with local gangs to stop their violence.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just his mum who loved it. Simmer Down was a hit for the island\u2019s biggest band, The Skatalites. Soon enough, there was a bigger one: The Wailing Wailers, who would become The Wailers, and finally Bob Marley And The Wailers.\n\nIn 1966, Marley married the Cuban-born Alpharita Anderson, a young single mother and student nurse. From the start she was a devoted wife, hand-washing his only pair of underpants every night, until he started making money and indulged himself with a more extensive underwear selection. Despite his serial infidelities, they stayed married until his death.\n\nSometimes, driven to despair by his latest affair or one-night-stand, Rita would refuse to have sex with him. One night in 1973, during one of these periods of forced abstinence, he raped her. The peace-loving Marley could not only be a physical brute, but also psychologically cruel, once telling a U.S. newspaper that his backing singer Rita Marley was his sister, not his wife, and even bringing home some of the babies he fathered with other women.\n\nOutrageously, he tried to pass off his priapic behaviour as a favour to Rita. She remembers him explaining that he wanted lots of children but, entirely for her sake, didn\u2019t want her to endure multiple childbirths. \u2018He\u2019d say, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get pregnant every year. So some of that is really just taking the burden off you and your body.\u201d\n\n\u2018When we argued, my line was always, \u201cI\u2019m your wife but I\u2019m not your slave, you know. I\u2019m not going to be your call girl. When you want to have sex, you call me to your room . . . No, no, no!\u201d\u2019\n\nRita never stopped loving him. But had he lived, she now believes that she wouldn\u2019t have stayed married to him, that his promiscuous lifestyle would eventually have pushed her away. Either that or it would have killed her, she thinks.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t have Aids at that time. But there were other diseases . . . I didn\u2019t know if he was using a condom, but I doubt it, because he was a Rasta man.\u2019 As it was, in 1976 their relationship nearly killed her anyway, when, albeit accidentally, she took a bullet for him. Jamaica was stuck in a terrible maelstrom of violence, so Marley organised a free outdoor concert, in the hope of bringing together the rival gangs and two antagonistic political parties.\n\nHe called it Smile Jamaica and pronounced it entirely non-political, but Prime Minister Manley promptly declared a general election, to cash in on Marley\u2019s popularity and moral authority.\n\nThe attack on 56 Hope Road took place a few days before the concert. It appears to have been led by a gangster who enjoyed the protection of Edward Seaga, Manley\u2019s Right-wing rival, who was supported by the U.S. government.\n\nBut Marley had already received death threats, so Manley had posted armed guards outside his home. On the night of the attack, the guards failed to turn up. Conspiracy theories abounded, such as one suggesting Manley had masterminded the attack, so he could blame it on Seaga.\n\nCourageously, Marley performed the Smile Jamaica concert anyway, but left the island the next day, ending up in self-imposed exile at 42 Oakley Street. In April 1978, he returned to Jamaica to give his famous One Love Peace concert.\n\nWhen he coaxed Manley and Seaga onto the stage and held up their hands, it seemed as if he had achieved the impossible. \u2018That was the night,\u2019 says one of Marley\u2019s biographers in the documentary, \u2018that Bob went from showman to shaman\u2019.\n\nTo Jamaica\u2019s underclass and plenty of others around the world, he still seemed a kind of god. The ultimate irony is that he died the most prosaically mortal of deaths.\n\nIn 1975, while playing football, he had injured a toe on his right foot. While living in Oakley Street, he damaged it again. When the toe didn\u2019t recover, a London doctor told him it could turn cancerous and should be taken off. Marley refused. \u2018Rasta no abide amputation,\u2019 he insisted.\n\nBut the doctor was right. In September 1980, Marley blacked out while jogging in Central Park. The cancer had spread from his toe to his brain. He died less than eight months later in Miami, and his body was flown back to Jamaica, where it lay in state. Thousands of people filed past.\n\nThe new Prime Minister, Edward Seaga, declared a national day of mourning. He said in his eulogy that \u2018such a man cannot be erased from the mind\u2019. Nor, now, will his legacy ever be erased from the history of a house in Chelsea.", "description": "A blue plaque has been unveiled on a handsome house in Chelsea in honour of its former resident, Jamaican musician Bob Marley.", "authors": ["Brian Viner For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19558140-0-image-a-2_1570740714949.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
