Amnesty said these could amount to war crimes.\n\nThe rights group highlighted several instances of possible violations of international law including a 12 October Turkish airstrike next to a school in Salhiye, where civilians fleeing the conflict had sought shelter.\n\nThe group said that the frontline was at least a mile away and that four people including two children had been killed.\n\n\u201cThey looked like charcoal,\u201d an aid worker at the scene told Amnesty. \u201cThe other two people killed were older men, they looked older than 50. Honestly, I am still in shock.\u201d\n\nAnother attack saw an airstrike hit a convoy of around 400 civilians travelling between Qamishli and Ras al-Ayn on 13 October. Amnesty said that a small contingent of fighters guarding the convoy did not justify the attack.\n\nThe airstrike, which was caught on camera, killed six civilians, including one journalist.\n\nA reporter at the scene described it as \u201can absolute massacre\u201d.\n\nAmnesty also investigated a mortar attack on a home in Qamishli which killed an 11-year-old boy and ripped off the leg of his eight-year-old sister.\n\nFinally, they detailed the 12 October \u201cambush\u201d and \u201cgrisly murder\u201d of Hervin Khalaf, a Kurdish politician, along the international highway linking Raqqa to the border town of Qamishli.\n\n\n\nAccording to witnesses and footage of the scene Amnesty analysed, she was dragged out of her car, beaten and shot dead \u201cin cold blood\u201d by fighters from Ahrar al-Sharqiya, part of the Syrian National Army, a coalition of Syrian armed groups equipped and supported by Turkey.\n\nA medical report shared with The Independent showed she was hit by multiple gunshot wounds to the head, face and back. She also had fractures to her legs, face and skull, and her skin had been detached from her skull as a result of being dragged by the hair.\n\n\u201cTurkish military forces and their allies have displayed an utterly callous disregard for civilian lives, launching unlawful deadly attacks in residential areas that have killed and injured civilians,\u201d said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International\u2019s secretary-general.\n\n\u201cWe call on Turkey again to end violations, hold perpetrators accountable, and protect civilians living under their control. Turkey cannot evade responsibility by outsourcing war crimes to armed groups,\u201d he added.\n\nAid workers and civilians from the towns caught up in the fighting attempted to reach encircled Ras al-Ayn on Friday to retrieve the dead and wounded but were forced to turn back.\n\nBritish volunteer Dana Ellis, 32 from London who was with the convoy of several hundred people, said they walked a kilometre before finally coming to a halt outside the town when they were warned Turkish-backed forces would fire on them.\n\nAlong the way, Ellis said they stumbled across a village, which had been flattened in the fighting.\n\n\"The was village smouldering, we spent two hours pulling bodies out of the rubble,\" she told The Independent, adding that in total they retrieved ten corpses.\n\n\"The bodies were in terrible condition and we had to leave two because we didn't have heavy machine to pull them out from under the rubble.\"\n\n\"People are tired, they are hungry but they are defiant,\" she added.\n\nThere are also concerns the offensive will see the resurgence of the Isis, as Kurdish forces redirect their troops guarding prisons and camps to the frontline.\n\nThe Kurds were holding at least 10,000 Isis fighters and their families across camps and prisons before the fighting erupted.\n\nOver 800 Isis affiliates managed to escape from Ain Issa camp, after the SDF lost control of it.\n\nIt\u2019s now empty and most of the 12,000 inhabitants remain unaccounted for.\n\nOfficials in al-Hol camp, home to 70,000 people, many of whom are the wives and widows of Isis fighters, told The Independent that 26 families had attempted to break free on Thursday night as the fighting drew close but had been reprehended.\n\n\u201cThe situation is under control but there are riots, chaos, and protests in the camp,\u201d said a site official.", "description": "Claims by Kurdish medics that Turkey\u00a0may have used white phosphorus on children in northeastern Syria\u00a0are being assessed by a\u00a0global chemical weapons watchdog.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/18/13/gettyimages-1176501598.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
