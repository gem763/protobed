It\u2019s massive in terms of the competition that we start off well in Pietermaritzburg and we're looking forward to it.\"\n\nKhan also know that facing the Cobras, one of the most successful franchises in South African cricket, will not be easy, more so because they will be hurting from their below-par start.\n\n\"They're a very good side and they've played really good four-day cricket over the past few years,\" he added. \"They're consistent, they have some experienced players and that has shown with their performances over the last number of seasons.\n\n\"So it's going to be a tough game and we\u2019ll have to be at our best to beat them.\"\n\nCobras coach Ashwell Prince, meanwhile, watched his side came agonisingly close to nicking a win against the Titans - the Cape side falling four wickets short in the end at Willowmoore Park.\n\nBut they produced a memorable performance nonetheless in what is always a highlight fixture of the four-day calendar, with Kyle Verreynne really announcing himself as a player of pedigree thanks to twin hundreds.\n\n\"It was a game that ebbed and flowed... we were up against it early on, we then recovered brilliantlywith that great partnership between the captain, Pieter Malan, and Kyle Verreynne, but then collapsed after that,\" Prince stated. \"Then we didn't bowl too well in the first innings until Dane Paterson bowled that unbelievable spell to bring us back into the game and then Kyle was unbelievable in both innings.\n\n\"So overall there were lots of parts of the game that we were happy with and lots of parts that we weren\u2019t happy with.\"\n\nLooking ahead to next week's journey to KZN, Prince admitted it was not a happy place for the Cobras to visit, but hoped the tables will turn in round three.\n\n\"It's going to be another tough one,\" he concluded. \"Obviously another away game, this time in Maritzburg. It's a place in my experiences, maybe the Dolphins have had good results there, but I always find it very difficult to get good results there.\n\n\"Hopefully this time around it will be different and we\u2019ll have a surface that gives both teams a chance of getting a result.\"", "description": "Dolphins coach Imraan Khan admits that starting well will be hugely important to their overall prospects when they welcome the Cape Cobras.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8214/5aed5bc6787649e2ad917f30f13b0248.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
