But that jaundiced view does not extend to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m just telling them, would you please just trust Nancy? And that\u2019s something for me to say, okay? Just so we\u2019re clear, America, that\u2019s something for me to say,\u201d Steele said as we both burst out laughing.\n\nThat\u2019s because it was Steele, during the 2010 midterm elections, who rode around the country in a bus that implored America to \u201cFire Pelosi.\u201d \u201cI have such respect for this woman. She is a formidable political presence today. Trump knows it,\u201d he says now.\n\nSteele believes the president is \u201cso cocksure of where he is\u201d that his mentality is that he\u2019s untouchable. Imitating Trump, Steele said, \u201cLook, I literally can shoot someone on Fifth Avenue, or guess what, I can stand in front of the United States Congress and just tear at the Constitution, and they won\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nAnd then came Pelosi. My sit-down with Steele came days after the release of the now-infamous photo of the Trump-Pelosi showdown at the White House.\n\n\u201c[Trump] is self-absorbed to the point where he thinks he\u2019s Superman, invulnerable. . . . But what I like to remind folks [is that] Kryptonite\u2019s a funny thing. And Nancy\u2019s got Kryptonite,\u201d Steele said. \u201cThe Constitution is the ultimate Kryptonite. And I think that moment is rapidly approaching, where \u2014 . Taking that picture of Nancy standing in that room. She takes that Kryptonite out of her purse and puts it on the table and walks out of the room. And homeboy can\u2019t get up \u2019cause he\u2019s now too weak. And I think that\u2019s her play, I think that\u2019s \u2014 . That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying: \u2018Trust Nancy\u2019.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs for Republicans, Steele is unsparing.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party has figured it is better to put on its Trump attitude than its constitutional attitude. And what I mean by that is it is better for the party to spend its time as a supplicant of the cult of personality that sits inside the White House than it is to stand on those very foundational ideals that define the party, and that we ultimately would define ourselves individually as Republicans,\u201d explained Steele.\n\nThis got us into a discussion about what happened to the moral underpinnings of the Republicans. Steele\u2019s response was equally bracing.\n\n\u201cMorally, how do you reconcile putting children in cages? Because if your moral compass is off on that in the first instance, your political answer is gonna be what we saw,\u201d Steele said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the space the party finds itself in right now. It is so disoriented in its moral compass; in other words, it can\u2019t even right itself on the very fundamental things that it is easy to right oneself on: Charlottesville. Baltimore. Children in cages. Allies left on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nListen to the podcast to hear more of Steele on the GOP, what happens to the party in 2024, and on the Greek chorus, as I call them, led by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.). And hear Steele pay tribute to the late Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.).\n\n\u201cI called him a servant leader, because, yes, he was a leader. He led big committees . . . he was the power in the room, but he was not afraid as a leader to understand that he was also in service to others,\u201d Steele said. \u201cAnd in that service, speak truth to that very power that he represented.\u201d\n\n\u201cCape Up\u201d is Jonathan\u2019s weekly podcast talking to key figures behind the news and our culture.
