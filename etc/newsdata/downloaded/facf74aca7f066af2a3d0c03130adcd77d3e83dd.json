Actors frequently hold them incorrectly. (iStock)\n\nColumnist\n\nYears ago, Quilted Northern, the toilet-paper people, ran an animated TV commercial that showed a group of women sitting around a table at a quilting bee. They were \u201cquilting\u201d the TP to give it its distinctive upholstered look.\n\n\u201cIt would have been sort of cute, except they were all holding knitting needles,\u201d wrote Elaine from Bethesda, Md.\n\n\u201cKnitted Northern\u201d is nicely onomatopoeic, but it sounds more like a brand of wool sweater than a brand of toilet paper.\n\nTim Slattery of Annandale, Va., noticed the commercial, too. \u201cMy mother was an expert quilter, and she was absolutely appalled by that ad,\u201d he wrote. \u201cQuilting has nothing to do with knitting. You use regular sewing needles. Clearly nobody at the ad agency knew the first thing about quilting or knitting!\u201d\n\nTo its credit, Quilted Northern redid the ad, substituting sewing needles for knitting needles. You can find both versions on YouTube.\n\nElaine and Tim are among readers who responded to my call for examples of things that TV, the movies and other forms of media seem to get wrong with alarming regularity.\n\n\n\nIn a Geico commercial, kids play Marco Polo in a swimming pool, with Marco Polo, and a saddled llama stands nearby. Llama is native to South America and uncommon in Europe and Asia. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\nBefore we leave knitting behind, Mary E. Butler of Ellicott City, Md., is dismayed by cartoons that show knitters holding the needles like pencils, with the tips pointing down.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely impossible to knit this way,\u201d she wrote.\n\nKathy Napierala of Silver Spring, Md., was peeved by that Geico commercial where kids are playing Marco Polo in a swimming pool with . . . Marco Polo. Standing next to the pool is a saddled llama.\n\n\u201cMarco Polo rode over Europe and Asia,\u201d Kathy wrote. \u201cOn his journey, he could have ridden horses, camels, mules, donkeys, oxen, even an elephant. What could he not have ridden? A llama, which is native to South America.\u201d\n\nEsperanza Alzona danced professionally for many years and now teaches ballet.\n\n\u201cIt makes me crazy when \u2018ballerinas\u2019 are depicted pointing their feet as they tie the ribbons on their shoes,\u201d wrote Esperanza, who lives in Frederick, Md. \u201cOne must flex the ankle, making it as wide as possible as the ribbons are tied. If the foot is pointed when the ribbons are tied, the circulation will be completely cut off and the dancer will not be able to flex the foot afterward. All the motion in the ankle would be severely restricted.\u201d\n\nWrote Esperanza: \u201cPointing feet while tying pointe shoe ribbons may look \u2018pretty\u2019 in a picture, but real dancers never do that.\u201d\n\nWell, real orchestra and band conductors don\u2019t wave their hands in the air like they\u2019re trying to bring in a 747, but Tom Logan of Sterling, Va., sees that sort of thing on TV shows all the time.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve studied conducting, you can always tell,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBad trombone-work is common, too, including moving the slide back and forth willy-nilly \u2014 or not moving it all.\n\nWrote Tom: \u201cIt\u2019s not a bugle.\u201d\n\nRoy Deppa of Brookeville, Md., plays the bagpipes \u2014 \u201centhusiastically, if not very well\u201d \u2014 and he frequently sees them being held wrong by actors, even on the BBC program \u201cMonarch of the Glen,\u201d which is set in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nWrote Roy: \u201cThe pipes are physically hard to play, and I understand that few actors would be expected to play them, but when they are obviously holding them wrong \u2014 drones over the wrong shoulder, hands reversed on the chanter, drones bunched up against the neck \u2014 it pains me.\u201d\n\nSome readers were pained by a caption with last week\u2019s column on visual errors. It said that a clarinet was pictured backward, when in fact it was only the mouthpiece that was reversed: twisted 180 degrees from how it\u2019s played.\n\nWell, played today. Readers Steven Tretter of Silver Spring and Arnold Saslowsky of Fairfax Station, Va., noted that Italian clarinetists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries favored the reed-on-top method. Who knew?\n\nBrian McGarry of Alexandria, Va., was flipping through the TV channels the other day when he alighted on the Hallmark Channel. It was showing a movie about a winemaker from California who went to France and found love. Frothy enough, but not to Brian.\n\nThe problem? A lot of the wine was in the wrong bottles.\n\n\u201cAll Pinot Noir \u2014 the grape that makes nearly all Burgundy red wine \u2014 comes in a bottle that has long sloped shoulders,\u201d Brian wrote. \u201cThey showed it in bottles with high shoulders. Those high-shouldered bottles are used in Bordeaux for grapes like Cabernet Sauvignon.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s enough to drive a person to drink.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Readers share more examples of the details ads, TV shows and movies get wrong.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fNpEtm1Ph0galHvJS0s3Yztj56A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6TRZIGGTFII6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
