(John Hanley/CBC)\n\nPeel Regional Police were called to an apartment building on Darcel Avenue near Morning Star Drive and Goreway Drive at 6:22 p.m. ET. Multiple vehicles with bullet holes could be seen in the area.\n\nInvestigators believe the shooting took place at a parkette behind the building. McCord told reporters that investigators have information that a music video was being filmed behind the building, but it's unknown if the shooting was related to that filming in any way.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence in the area for much of the evening as officers combed through the building to rule out any other victims or possible suspects.\n\n\"It is a large scene and a very dynamic investigation,\" police spokesperson Iryna Yashnyk told reporters earlier in the evening.\n\nPolice had several units in the area Saturday night, including tactical and K9 teams. Investigators spoke with several witnesses and are canvassing for video.\n\nPolice are working on notifying the victim's next of kin and say the homicide bureau has been notified.\n\nSHOTS FIRED <br>- 6:22pm <br>- Morning Star/Goreway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mississauga?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Mississauga</a> <br>- Unknown number of victims<br>- Multiple units, tactical, K9 in the area \u2014@PeelPoliceMedia", "description": "A 17-year-old boy is dead and five others were wounded after gunfire erupted in Mississauga on Saturday evening, Peel Regional Police say.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284278.1568512686!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mississauga-shooting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
