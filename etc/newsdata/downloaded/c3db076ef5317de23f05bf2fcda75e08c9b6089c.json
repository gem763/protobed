Trump, Graham swing apart over Syria", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The golf-and-politics alliance between President Donald Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham frayed Wednesday over Syria, with the South Carolina Republican threatening to become the White House\u2019s \u201cworst nightmare\u201d unless more is done to protect Kurdish fighters against Turkish attacks.\n\nTrump, in turn, suggested Graham focus on his job leading the Senate Judiciary Committee and reminded him who\u2019s in a position to threaten whom.\n\n\u201cI am the boss,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAsked whether he could still work with Trump, Graham huffed, \u201cI don\u2019t care right now.\u201d\n\nIt was a striking change in one of Trump\u2019s most unlikely Washington partnerships, part of a broader rupture with congressional Republicans who increasingly struggle to defend the president\u2019s foreign policy. That\u2019s generally not been a challenge for Graham, at least since the 2016 election. Throughout Trump\u2019s time in office, Graham has modeled the technique of flattering and supporting the president where possible and saying he \u201cdisagrees\u201d with him at other times.\n\nTheir falling out may not last long, as Graham has publicly disagreed with Trump before only to return to the fold. And Trump has reason to preserve ties, as Graham has become a useful ally \u2014 something he can\u2019t spare as he tries to hold GOP support against possible impeachment by the House. Graham in recent weeks had been on the airwaves defending him on that.\n\nThe relationship between the two men is walking proof at how successful Trump has been at bending the Republican Party to his will. The two men clashed repeatedly during the early stages of the 2016 campaign, with Graham declaring that the brash New York businessman was unfit for the post he sought. Trump accused the senator of Beltway hypocrisy, at one point even reading out his cell phone number at a rally.\n\nBut after that November\u2019s stunning result, Graham began to cozy up to the new president. And Trump let him.\n\nFor the president, having Graham as an ally opened a conduit to the establishment in the Republican Senate. Graham was willing to provide ardent support for the White House\u2019s doomed efforts to overturn \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nIt was during those negotiations that the two men began to forge a friendship and Trump told confidants that he was surprised and appreciative of the senator\u2019s willingness to aggressively defend him on television \u2014 something few other Republican senators seemed willing to do with any consistency, according to three White House officials and Republicans close to the president who are not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nTrump has observed that Graham\u2019s eagerness to attach himself to the president was likely to ward off a possible primary challenge from the right, a testament to the power of his base. But Graham\u2019s willingness to break with his longtime friend, Sen. John McCain \u2014 whom Trump loathed \u2014 to frequently side with Trump also delighted the president, his allies said. And the president still praises Graham\u2019s aggressive defense of Brett Kavanaugh during last year\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Trump has mused that he needs more \u201cenergy\u201d like that from other Republicans, according to the officials.\n\nAll that recent professed goodwill seemed to crumble when the White House announced Oct. 6 that Trump was withdrawing U.S. forces from protecting the Syrian Kurds, clearing the way for a brutal invasion by the Turks. Trump\u2019s move was a stick in the eye of the hawkish senator who had acted as something of a presidential educator on foreign policy. Three years after raging against the former New York developer for being unqualified for the presidency, Graham was back to hammering Trump.\n\nSyria, Graham tweeted, was \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency\u201d and made Trump no better than President Barack Obama. The move would help ISIS break the prisons the Kurds have been guarding, Graham said. And if there is another terrorist attack, he said, it\u2019s on Trump.\n\nThen Graham, who is up for reelection next year, launched a vague threat against a president fond of retaliating against his critics.\n\n\u201cI will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d Graham told Pat Robertson on TV\u2019s \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d in remarks broadcast Wednesday. \u201cTo President Trump, if you\u2019re listening to this interview, if you remove all of our forces from Syria, you\u2019re throwing the Kurds over, ISIS will come back on your watch, and Iran will take over and you, my friend, will be in great jeopardy of losing the election.\u201d\n\nTrump suggested Graham mind his own Senate business and his political fortunes, which Trump defined partly as defending Trump.\n\n\u201cI think Lindsey should focus on Judiciary,\u201d Trump said at the White House alongside Italian President Sergio Mattarella. \u201cThe people of South Carolina want to see those troops come home and I won an election based on that.\u201d\n\nPolitically, the threats are thin gruel, as neither man is in danger of losing South Carolina next year. Trump remains popular there, and Graham\u2019s outspokenness tracks with his campaign\u2019s announcement this week of record fund-raising \u2014 for the state and among Republican Senate candidates in this filing period.\n\nBut both men face blowback from their pasts. Trump is facing the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry over his pressure on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Biden family, a matter that troubles many Republicans and is replayed daily as the House hauls in a different current or former administration official to testify on the subject.\n\nAnd Graham is weathering criticism over his flip-flop for trashing Trump as a \u201cnutjob\u201d in 2016, only to turn around and embrace him as president. He\u2019s also got a past when it comes to impeachment. Graham, a former Air Force prosecutor, was among the House members most aggressively gunning for President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings in 1999.\n\nThen a House prosecutor, Graham spoke from the well of the Senate to make the case: \u201cImpeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.\u201d\n\nNow a senator, Graham seems to be part of the impeachment defense. Asked about whether Trump improperly asked Ukraine\u2019s leader to undermine a political opponent, Graham replied he had \u201czero problems with this phone call.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from San Antonio.
