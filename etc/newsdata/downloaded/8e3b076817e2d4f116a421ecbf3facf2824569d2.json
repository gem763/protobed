Cuts to state and local programs have translated into clinic closures, decreased staffing and ultimately fewer patient screenings and follow-ups.\n\nOver the last five years, chlamydia cases increased 19%, gonorrhea cases increased 63% and syphilis cases increased 71%.\n\nHuman papillomavirus virus, which 79 million Americans are infected with, remains the most common sexually transmitted disease.\n\nMost worrying of all was a spike in syphilis transmission from mothers to newborns during pregnancy, which skyrocketed 185% -- to 1,306 cases -- in 2018.\n\nABC News Chart Illustration\n\nCongenital syphilis, which can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth and severe neurological problems for babies, resulted in 94 newborn deaths last year, a number Dr. Gail Bolan, director of the CDC\u2019s Division of STD Prevention called \"startling\" in a statement.\n\nThe rise in congenital syphilis is especially worrisome because it indicates a breakdown in the health care system, explained Holly Hagan, director of the NYU College of Global Public Health Center for Drug Use and HIV/HCV Infection.\n\n\"Where there is good access to regular health care, screening for infectious disease and access to family planning, congenital syphilis should not occur,\" Hagan added.\n\nDecreased condom could also be contributing to the increases, experts say, a practice that might be fueled in part by advances in the prevention of HIV transmission.\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, for example, the once-daily pill that prevents HIV transmission, does not offer protection against the spread of other sexually transmitted diseases. In 2016, roughly 80,000 Americans filled prescriptions for the medication.\n\nKateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images\n\nPeople on PrEP may take the calculated risk of contracting gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis when they have sex without using a condom, because they know those diseases are curable, explained Dr. David Bell, an associate professor of population and family health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\n\"They obviously don't want those infections,\" he added. \"But they do end up taking the risk, to some degree.\"\n\nThe protocol for providers who have patients taking PrEP is to screen those individuals sexually transmitted disease much more frequently than they would otherwise, at least once every three months. There's a possibility that increased screening could be capturing more individuals with sexually transmitted diseases than screenings did when PrEP use was less prevalent.\n\nBell pointed to the importance of treating chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis, in order to decrease their overall prevalence in the U.S. population, particularly in areas of the county with pockets of high STI rates, like parts of the South.\n\n\"We have put most of our eggs in the basket around the personal responsibility and personal morality of using condoms. But a major part of prevention should be testing for sexually transmitted infections and curing them,\" he said. \"If we had decreased prevalence our rates wouldn't be going up.\"\n\nImage Source/Getty Images, FILE\n\nChlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis, which can all be treated with antibiotics, can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy and increased HIV risk if left untreated. The CDC recommends that boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 12 get vaccinated against HPV, which can lead to cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile and anal cancers.\n\nRisk factors for sexually transmitted diseases include having unprotected sex, sex with multiple partners and having a previous history of STI infection, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nHalf of the infections occur in people between the ages of 15 and 24, although men treated for erectile dysfunction medication are also at a higher risk for STIs than the general population.", "description": "Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis hit record high numbers in 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/chlamydia-gty-jt-191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
