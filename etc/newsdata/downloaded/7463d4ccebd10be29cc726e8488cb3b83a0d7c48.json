As a mum, I feel it's so important that charities like this are able to bring a sense of normality to family life during some of the most difficult times.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images for National Lotter)\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\nSophie was attending the hospice to see how funds from The National Lottery support charities across the UK.\n\nOver the past 25 years, National Lottery players have raised an incredible \u00a310.3 billion for charities across the UK, with 80 per cent of grants going to smaller charities.\n\nThis includes projects run by the smallest of grassroots community organisations right up to national charities, such as Mind UK, The Wildlife Trust, NSPCC, Age UK and The Princes Trust to name but a few.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOne of the mums at the pyjama party was Shirley McIntyre, whose son Charlie, nine, was born with Lissencephaly - a rare, gene-linked condition which affects about one in 100,000 babies.\n\nCharlie has been visiting Claire House for three years and typically spends two days and nights at the hospice per week.\n\nShirley said: \"Charlie can't walk or talk, and he can't use his hands or sit up.\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\n\"Everything you or I take for granted or do on a daily basis, Charlie can't do. In developmental terms he's the equivalent of a six-month-old.\n\n\"It's a little holiday for him being here, and a much-needed break for us. He has a lovely time and gets spoilt rotten.\n\n\"There's always something going on for the kids. Charlie can't do a lot of things, but enjoys painting and making things, and enjoys getting involved.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\nDavid Pastor, CEO, Claire House Children's Hospice, added: \"The pyjama party with Sophie has been amazing and it's helped create some really special memories for the children, their siblings and parents.\n\n\"We're really pleased to be part of the National Lottery's 25th birthday celebrations.\n\n\"Funding from The National Lottery has helped us improve facilities for children and young people and refurbish our Art Room so children and their families have an up to date, safe and fun place to spend time together.\n\n\"Alongside charities in every part of the UK, we want to say a big thank you to National Lottery players who raise so much for charities and community groups.\"", "description": "The singer, who has just released her new album, The Song Diaries, surprised children at the Wirral Hospital with stories and cake", "authors": ["Adrian Hearn", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images For National Lotter", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743711.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Sophie-Ellis-Bextor-visits-childrens-hospice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
