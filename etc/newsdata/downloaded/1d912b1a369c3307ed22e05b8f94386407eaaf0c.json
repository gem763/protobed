He said he did not know if anything was altered, but referred to a history at the company of falsifying records and signing off on dodgy maintenance and repair jobs.\n\nEthiopian Airlines said in a statement emailed to AFP that directly after the crash \"all relevant hard copy maintenance records of the aircraft involved in the accident\" were sealed, stored in a secure place and delivered to investigators.\n\n\"All maintenance activities done and pilot remarks reported on the aircraft before the accident are recorded on hard copy documents. Hard copies are the official records of aircraft. The allegation that pilot and technicians\u2019 notes were changed is completely false,\" the airline said.\n\nThe airline has presented Yonas as a \"disgruntled employee\", while he told AP he fled the country after being arrested and interrogated for talking to journalists about his concerns following the crash.\n\nEthiopian Airlines is the biggest carrier in Africa and has rapidly expanded, regularly adding new routes to its already busy schedule across the globe.\n\nOn Tuesday night Ethiopian Airlines jet made an emergency landing in Dakar with one of its engines on fire, though all 90 passengers and crew were unharmed.", "description": "Ethiopian Airlines denied whistleblower accusations that it tampered with the maintenance records of the Boeing 737 MAX jet which crashed in March, killing all 157 people on board.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9454/cb8757bf1f844e82bf5aad1f5e9e8f77.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
