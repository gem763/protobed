Without them on the bench today, I couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\nTwo hours earlier, Federer had delighted a sold-out crowd of 17,000 in his home country by beating John Isner 6-4, 7-6 (3) to set up the winner-take-all finale.\n\nThe European team also won the first two Laver Cup editions, played in 2017 in Prague and last year in Chicago.\n\nEurope began Sunday leading 7-5 in a scoring system that gave one point for a win on Friday and two on Saturday. Victories in the doubles and each of three singles matches scored three points on Sunday.\n\nNadal scratched from Europe\u2019s intended lineup in both the opening doubles with Federer and the first singles due to an inflamed hand.\n\nIsner and doubles specialist Jack Sock then beat Federer and Stefanos Tsitsipas 5-7, 6-4, 10-8.\n\nNadal\u2019s replacement in singles, No. 5 ranked Dominic Thiem, was beaten 7-5, 6-7 (3), 10-5 by Taylor Fritz in a second straight match decided by the super-tiebreaker.\n\nStory continues\n\nFritz was a late replacement for Nick Kyrgios, who like Nadal scratched after both had played in singles and doubles on Saturday.\n\nStrong play by the Americans on Sunday gave the world team an overall lead for the first time in the three-day competition.\n\nIsner and Sock improved to 3-0 in Laver Cup doubles, and the 30th-ranked Fritz overcame Austria\u2019s Thiem.\n\n\u201cThis has to be one of the biggest wins of my career,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person that really doesn\u2019t want to let my team down.\u201d\n\nWith Europe needing to sweep the last two rubbers, Federer came through in a typically tight match against Isner with few break-point chances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled that I was able to give something back to the team,\u201d Federer said. \u201cObviously to see Rafa on the sidelines after having to pull out with an injury, it\u2019s great camaraderie I feel.\u201d", "description": "After Roger Federer secured a must-win for Team Europe, Alexander Zverev ensured the Laver Cup was retained against Milos Raonic of Team World.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dDmMZXBlDE_O7ZWmB81HKg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/THDe2p.ZFOg1ea7rLb125Q--~B/aD04NDg7dz0xNTA2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/peter_king_on_nbc_sports_543/dc76bb0e3f92852a48a7855dcba8db75", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
