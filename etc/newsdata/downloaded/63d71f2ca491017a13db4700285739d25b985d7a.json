He used the example of a \"time-starved family\" juggling activities like a baseball game and a birthday party.\n\nHe said that that family will sometimes rely more on the \"extensive training\" of Walmart's personal shopper, while in other instances they may prefer to visit the stores themselves.\n\nDepending on what their schedule looks like, the family may even opt to drive over to the store for a parking lot pickup of their purchases.\n\nWard said that Walmart's biggest concern is providing \"maximum convenience\" to its shoppers, regardless of how customers want their needs to be met.\n\n\"What we absolutely want to do is get that same great value and same great convenience in all the ways that you can interact with the customer,\" Ward said.", "description": "Walmart SVP of digital operations Tom Ward told the audience at Groceryshop that he doesn't see delivery and in-store shopping as a \"binary\" choice.", "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7fa3e72e22af189e7207b8-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
