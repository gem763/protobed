The government in Westminster will not accept it, we will not accept it.\"\n\nIain Duncan Smith, a Eurosceptic Conservative MP, said: \"This looks suspiciously like the EU, realising they are about to look like the bad guys, making a tokenistic offer. This is about shifting the blame to Boris Johnson.\"", "description": "'The real traitor is he or she who risks bringing disaster on his country, its economy, and its citizens,' said Guy Verhofstadt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9459/fd93d3f910b940fcabf678bfa0f247c6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
