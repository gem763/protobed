Last season as a rookie top-10 pick he was with the hapless Arizona Cardinals, the worst team in the NFL, and struggled badly in a horrendous situation. Then he was traded to the Miami Dolphins, who might be the worst team of all time.\n\nIs Rosen bad? Or has he just been the victim of being on miserable teams two years in a row? It might be a while before we find out the truth.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nRosen won\u2019t get another shot in the foreseeable future. At least that\u2019s what Dolphins coach Brian Flores says today. Flores told the media that Ryan Fitzpatrick will remain the team\u2019s starting quarterback. The Dolphins are 0-7 and it\u2019s not too early to worry about an infamous 0-16. Fitzpatrick gives the Dolphins the best chance to win, Flores said.\n\nSo even though Rosen might help the Dolphins in the future, Fitzpatrick will remain quarterback. And it seems like Miami has decided Rosen isn\u2019t really part of their future.\n\nJosh Rosen will continue to back up Ryan Fitzpatrick\n\nIf the Dolphins had any hope for Rosen developing into a franchise quarterback, he would be their starter right now. The fact that he can\u2019t keep the starting job for a team that is tanking tells you all you need to know.\n\nFlores wanted Rosen to keep the job. He said early this month that the starting quarterback job was \u201csettled\u201d and Rosen would be the team\u2019s starter. Then after a bad half against the Washington Redskins later that week, Flores changed his mind, put in Fitzpatrick and has stuck with him.\n\nStory continues\n\nFlores didn\u2019t look great in making a decision on Rosen and changing his mind after two bad quarters. But it probably reflects much more poorly on Rosen, who couldn\u2019t hold a job the Dolphins wanted him to have.\n\nMiami Dolphins quarterback Josh Rosen will continue to back up Ryan Fitzpatrick. (Getty Images)\n\nRosen hasn\u2019t played well\n\nRosen hasn\u2019t done a lot to earn more playing time. He has been on two bad teams but hasn\u2019t made either of them better. He has a brutal 52 passer rating and has been outplayed by the 36-year-old journeyman Fitzpatrick. Since avoiding 0-16 is preferred, it makes sense why the Dolphins won\u2019t start Rosen until they get that one win, at least.\n\nBut it seems hard to believe that Rosen is thought of as a future starting quarterback in Miami beyond this season. The Dolphins are stocked with picks in next year\u2019s draft, will likely draft first overall, and there are quality quarterback prospects in the 2020 class. It was worth it to trade a late second-round pick for Rosen, but it hasn\u2019t paid off. Maybe that will change if Rosen gets a chance later this season and plays well, but it seems more likely he\u2019ll either be backing up someone like Tua Tagovailoa next season or on his third team.\n\nHopefully for Rosen, he eventually gets a chance with someone better than the 2018 Cardinals or 2019 Dolphins.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
