It would put $29.2 billion in new money into PG&E, up from a prior $28.4 billion offer, in exchange for new debt and a controlling equity stake.\n\nThe committee representing individual wildfire victims in PG&E's bankruptcy supports the noteholders' plan as it would create a $14.5 billion trust to pay their claims.\n\nPG&E has proposed funding a trust to compensate the victims capped at $8.4 billion.\n\nLawyers for the wildfire victims committee and the noteholders group will ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali at a hearing on Monday for an order that would allow the noteholders group to file its reorganization plan.\n\nPG&E in its filing on Friday objected to that request, arguing it should remain the only party in its bankruptcy with the right to file a reorganization plan, adding its plan will pay the company's debtholders in full.\n\nThe power provider also proposed a mediator be appointed to help it and its stakeholders try to craft a plan they can all support.\n\nIf PG&E resolves its bankruptcy by the end of next June, it can participate in a recently enacted, $21 billion state fund to help California's investor-owned utilities pay for future wildfires liabilities.\n\nPG&E has said that taking part in the fund, which the utilities would help support with contributions, will enhance its finances over the long term.\n\nLenders putting up debt financing for PG&E's planned reorganization are JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, Bank of America NA, BofA Securities Inc, Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, according to a commitment letter attached to Friday's filing.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jim Christie; Editing by Tom Brown and Grant McCool)", "description": "PG&E Corp said in court papers on Friday it has debt financing commitments of $34.35 billion for a planned Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, countering a group of noteholders that has proposed its own reorganization plan for the California power producer.
