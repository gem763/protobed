USA TODAY\n\nTORONTO \u2013 Early on in the Netflix biopic comedy \u201cDolemite Is My Name,\u201d Eddie Murphy \u2013 as 1970s-era blaxploitation icon Rudy Ray Moore \u2013 is tooling around the record store where he works and hits the resident DJ (Snoop Dogg) with some truth: \u201cI'm not lying, man, people love me.\u201d\n\nThe same could be said for Moore, a struggling comedian and actor who became a rhyming, rapping raconteur and rode his Dolemite character \u2013 complete with groovy fashion ensembles and the ever-present pimp cane \u2013 to big-screen glory.\n\nBut it definitely was true of Murphy in his 1980s and \u201890s heyday, who came up on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d before rocketing to Hollywood stardom with \u201cBeverly Hills Cop,\u201d and will be with \u201cDolemite,\u201d which premiered Saturday at Toronto International Film Festival. Murphy's first major movie since 2011\u2019s \u201cTower Heist\u201d \u2013 and his most buzzed-about effort this side of his Oscar-nominated turn in 2006\u2019s \u201cDreamgirls\u201d \u2013 is also his ultimate film role, one that encompasses everything Murphy does well. (Apologies to Axel Foley and Donkey, though we still adore them, too.)\n\nRanked: All the best films we saw at Toronto Film Festival\n\nToronto Film Festival: Michael B.

(Photo: FRANCOIS DUHAMEL/NETFLIX)\n\nAs the lovably profane Rudy in the film (in select theaters Oct. 4, streaming on Netflix Oct. 25), Murphy wears that signature toothy grin of his while embracing the absurdities of the Dolemite character. He karate-chops with gusto (if not grace), has a squad of kung fu prostitutes, literally brings the house down with his sex scenes and really shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use a firearm. Dolemite is like six \u201cSNL\u201d personas in one, and they\u2019re all a hoot.\n\nRudy\u2019s been kicked around and told no so many times, though, we root for all the success he has \u2013 even the really goofy stuff. Close your eyes, though, and his delivery\u2019s not too far off from Donkey in the \u201cShrek\u201d movies. Just by the sound of his voice, you can tell he\u2019s having the most fun in the room. And when Murphy launches into one of his rifftastic spoken-word tirades \u2013 with machine-gunned four-letter words \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to think of Murphy\u2019s brilliant stand-up in \u201cRaw.\u201d\n\nThere is a serious side to Rudy\u2019s story, too: the yearning to finally be famous for something, to have the chance to do something. He doesn\u2019t look like a superstar, either, obviously aging and carrying a paunch. Among his band of filmmaking misfits, Rudy confides most in Lady Reed (Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph) about his insecurities and the movie \u2013 which always seems to be about five minutes from falling apart \u2013 and pulls from that \u201cDreamgirls\u201d dramatic streak to create a complex man in the middle of all the craziness.\n\nAnd does it need mentioning that Murphy is still insanely, gloriously funny? \u201cBowfinger\u201d has always been his high point in being all-around hilarious, with \u201cComing to America\u201d a close second, and \u201cDolemite\u201d fits right in with his best work as a multidimensional comedian.\n\nEddie Murphy (left), Keegan-Michael Key and Wesley Snipes star in \"Dolemite Is My Name.\" (Photo: FRANCOIS DUHAMEL/NETFLIX)\n\nMurphy has been missed in recent years, although he\u2019s about to come back into the spotlight in a big way: In addition to \u201cDolemite,\u201d he\u2019s hosting \u201cSNL\u201d on Dec. 21 for the first time in more than 30 years, starring in the upcoming \u201cComing to America\u201d sequel and pondering a stand-up tour next year.\n\nWhether he\u2019s got another Oscar nomination \u2013 or even a win \u2013 coming is tougher to say, with a bunch of strong candidates vying for best actor this awards season. He doesn\u2019t need it, though \u2013 like Dolemite, he seems fine being among the people, doing what he does best, saying whatever he wants to say. And in that sense, Murphy\u2019s as good as gold.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/09/08/eddie-murphy-dolemite-is-my-name-his-greatest-hits-role-tiff/2254471001/", "description": "Eddie Murphy is back in a big way in the Netflix biopic 'Dolemite Is My Name,' and the 1970s blaxploitation hero is the comedian's greatest-hits role.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published A.M.
