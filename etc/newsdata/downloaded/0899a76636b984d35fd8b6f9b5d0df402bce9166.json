REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\n\nThe Trump administration, which last year pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran, will let the work go forward by issuing waivers to sanctions that bar non-U.S. firms from dealing with the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), said the sources on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile the waivers\u2019 renewal would allow non-proliferation work to continue at the Arak heavy water research reactor and the Fordow fuel enrichment plant, which AEOI oversees, it may also signal that Washington is leaving the door open to diplomacy.\n\nUnder the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions that had crippled its economy.\n\nWhen U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally abandoned the deal in May 2018, he re-imposed U.S. sanctions in a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign designed to force Iran to return to the negotiating table.\n\nTrump wants a broader deal that would also limit Iran\u2019s missile program as well as its regional activities; Iran has demanded the United States first resume complying with the 2015 deal called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\nFrance, in particular, has sought to bring the two into a wider dialogue but has so far failed, suggesting neither is yet willing to abandon core elements of policy: the U.S. belief that pressure will bring Iran to its knees, and Iran\u2019s refusal to capitulate to U.S. duress.\n\nUnder the 2015 deal, the Arak reactor was to be redesigned to render it unable to make bomb-grade plutonium under normal operation, while the Fordow plant was to stop enriching uranium and be converted into a nuclear, physics and technology center.\n\nChinese state-owned China National Nuclear Corp has done non-proliferation work at Arak, and Russia\u2019s Rosatom has done it at Fordow. Rosatom has also provided uranium fuel for Iran\u2019s Bushehr nuclear power plant.\n\nThe U.S. State Department had no immediate comment. Rosatom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China National Nuclear Corp could not immediately be reached for comment.", "description": "The United States plans to allow Russian, Chinese and European companies to continue work at Iranian nuclear facilities to make it harder for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Arshad Mohammed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446720691&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1ZC", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
