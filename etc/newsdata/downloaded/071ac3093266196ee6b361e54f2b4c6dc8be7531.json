(Photo: Charissa Kennedy, MakeItGrateful.com)\n\nThis orange cranberry French toast bake uses the quintessential flavors of fall in an unexpected, new way. It\u2019s a morning dish that\u2019s way more fun than muffins \u2013 and maybe easier, too. Whether you\u2019re making it for a fall brunch or for a holiday morning, this French toast bake preps early for smooth sailing.\n\nAnd because holiday cooking gets super-hectic the day of, this dish is a great solution. A breakfast that you can prepare the night before, maybe even while making fresh cranberry sauce, is a winner!\n\nMore: Healthy turmeric breakfast muffins: Get the recipe\n\nWHAT YOU'LL NEED:\n\n12 fresh croissants (medium-sized), cut in half\n\n2 cups whole cranberries\n\n2 oranges, peeled and sliced\n\n\u00bd cup goat cheese, crumbled\n\n12 large eggs\n\n2 cups whole milk\n\n3 tablespoons orange zest (peel of one orange)\n\n1/4 cup maple syrup\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n1 teaspoon pink Himalayan salt\n\nPowdered sugar, to dust over once baked\n\nEggs, croissants and breakfast ingredients.

So, save yourself some time, and grab a dozen croissants from the store.\n\nSave the orange peel of at least one orange, and set aside the zest for the egg mixture.\n\nCut the croissants in half and place half of them on a large baking pan. Disperse half the cranberries, orange slices and crumbled goat cheese evenly between the layers of croissants. Add the remaining croissants, and then top with the remaining oranges, cranberries and goat cheese.\n\nNow for the egg mixture: Combine and whisk eggs, milk, salt, maple syrup, vanilla and orange peel. Pour the mixture over the pan, making sure to spread evenly. Not everything will be drenched in the egg mixture. That\u2019s ideal. You\u2019ll get the French toast custard-like bake on most of the dish, while some of the croissants at the top stay nice and toasty. This adds texture that separates the dish from strata and bread pudding.\n\nCover the French toast bake with foil and refrigerate. If you want to leave it overnight, you can. If you just want to make it early in the morning and refrigerate for two hours, that works, too.\n\nMore: Sweet potato pecan rolls: Get the recipe\n\nTake the dish out of the refrigerator and let set on the counter for 30 minutes.
