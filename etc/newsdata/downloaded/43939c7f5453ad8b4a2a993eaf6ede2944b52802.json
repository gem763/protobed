Creative director Neil Druckmann issued a blog post today addressing the delay, noting that the game isn\u2019t quite up to Naughty Dog\u2019s standards.\n\n\u201cAt this point we were faced with two options: compromise parts of the game or get more time,\u201d Druckmann wrote. \u201cWe went with the latter, and this new release date allows us to finish everything to our level of satisfaction while also reducing stress on the team.\u201d\n\nDruckmann added that while he and the team are \u201crelieved\u201d they\u2019ll have time to polish the game before they release it, they are \u201cdisappointed that we weren\u2019t able to avoid this exact situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wish we could\u2019ve foreseen the amount of polish we needed, but the size and scope of this game got the better of us,\u201d Druckmann wrote. \u201cWe hate disappointing our fans and for that we\u2019re sorry.\u201d\n\nThe Last of Us Part II is designed to explore many questions set within the game\u2019s universe, especially around the theme of revenge.
