The actions taken this week are about right-sizing the organization to the revenue we expect to achieve in 2020.\u201d\n\nAmongst the executives who lost their jobs at Hexo were chief manufacturing officer Arno Groll and chief marketing officer Nick Davies.\n\nAs of April 30, 2019, the company employed 822 people. Hexo added another 250 employees through the acquisition of licensed producer Newstrike Brands Ltd. The company also has a joint venture with Molson Coors called Truss Beverage Co., which produces cannabis-infused drinks. It is unclear how many jobs directly related to Truss\u2019 and Newstrike\u2019s operations were part of the job cuts. Both companies did not immediately respond to the Post\u2019s requests.\n\nThe Gatineau, Que.-based licensed producer has seen its stock price erode over the past few weeks, since announcing a negative revision to its upcoming revenue forecasts \u2014 the company had targeted $26 million in sales for the quarter ending July 31, but cut that forecast by about 40 per cent to $14.5 million.\n\nIn addition to the $70 million raise, Hexo also announced Wednesday it would delay its earnings release, which had been expected Oct. 24, to Oct. 28.\n\nCIBC\u2019s cannabis analyst, John Zamparo, expressed concern over the necessity of the raise, given Hexo\u2019s fairly healthy cash position. \u201cWe are surprised at this decision\u2026 We project Hexo would not encounter potential capital shortfalls until mid-2022,\u201d Zamparo wrote in a note to clients Thursday morning.\n\nHe also questioned the timing of the raise, pointing out the capital constraint in the cannabis industry over the past few months. \u201cHexo\u2019s stock is near 52-week lows following its withdrawal of F2020 revenue guidance and a significant reduction to FQ419 guidance. The decision to raise equity in these conditions is curious.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: vsubramaniam@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VanmalaS", "description": "'This has been my hardest day at HEXO Corp' \u2014 CEO", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/hexo-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
