Pettit's attorney, John Robertson, did not respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment, while Reavis' attorney, James Cooper, told ABC News that he has \u201cno comment at this time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Stephen Walter\u2019s attorney, William Harris, confirmed to ABC that his client is scheduled to be arraigned on Oct. 31 and will also enter a not guilty plea.\n\n\u201cCounterfeit pharmaceutical pills are especially dangerous because users are unable to verify what they are ingesting,\u201d William D. Bodner of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s Los Angeles field division and special agent in charge of the investigation said in a statement. \u201cThe tragic death of Mac Miller is a high-profile example of the tragedy that is occurring on the streets of America every day.\u201d\n\nAddiction crisis turns deadly amid 'war on drugs'\n\nHistorian David Herzberg, who studies the history of prescription drug abuse in America and drugs in popular culture, told ABC News that Miller\u2019s overdose death is a stark reminder of how deadly the opioid epidemic has become.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between an addiction crisis and an overdose crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe started with an addiction crisis and now it\u2019s an overdose crisis.\u201d\n\nThe addiction epidemic in the U.S. began in the mid-1990s with the rise of big pharma and the launch of drugs like OxyContin in 1996, but by the late 2000s, it had transformed into an overdose epidemic, according to Herzberg.\n\nKatharine Lotze/Getty Images\n\nMore than half a million Americans died from drug overdoses from 2000 to 2015, and opioids \u2013 both prescription and illicit \u2013 have been the \u201cmain drivers of increases in drug overdose deaths over the past 15 years,\u201d according to a 2017 report by the Drug Policy Alliance (DPC) \u2014 a non-profit organization dedicated to ending the \u201cwar on drugs.\u201d\n\nLindsay LaSalle, the managing director of public health law and policy at the DPC, told ABC News that in the early 2000s, there was \u201can influx of opioid related prescriptions into various communities\u201d that was \u201clargely unregulated.\u201d\n\nTo limit access, federal and state laws were passed to crack down on pill mills, doctor and pharmacy shopping, and prescription monitoring drug databases were implemented, making it more difficult for users to obtain these prescriptions.\n\nThese policies targeting consumers ended up cutting addicts off from their supply, LaSalle said, so in desperation, they turned to the street market, causing a boom in an industry where counterfeit or mixed drugs have become rampant.\n\n\u201cIt became an overdose crisis for a preventable reason \u2014 It was a policy failure on our part,\u201d Herzberg said. \u201cThe policy failure was that we accepted a \u2018drug war\u2019 story about what was going wrong, which was that evil drug abusers were exploiting the medical system,\u201d he added. \u201cThat policy didn\u2019t take into account the role of the pharmaceutical industry, instead and as a result, consumers were hurt.\u201d\n\nFentanyl floods market amid illicit drug sale boom\n\nAccording to the Drug Policy Alliance report, the most recent spike in overdose deaths is attributed to illicitly manufactured fentanyl \u2014 a synthetic opioid pain reliever that is often prescribed to treat severe pain, regularly in cases of advanced cancer and, according to the Centers for Disease Control, it is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.\n\nKevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nLaSalle said that fentanyl became more popular over the past five years amid a boom in the street market. Unable to obtain prescription pills, many addicts turned to heroin in 2010 and when the market could not support the rising demand for the drug, suppliers turned to fentanyl, which is cheaper and faster to produce.\n\n\u201cIn 2013 we started to see the first wave of an influx of fentanyl adulteration because it\u2019s significantly cheaper to produce and it\u2019s much more potent,\u201d LaSalle said, adding that drug suppliers began cutting it into their supply \u2014 often in cocaine \u2014 to meet demand and reduce costs.\n\nIn the statement announcing the charges in the Miller case, United States Attorney Nick Hanna pointed to the role of fentanyl in driving the overdose crisis.\n\n\u201cIt has become increasingly common for us to see drug dealers peddling counterfeit pharmaceuticals made with fentanyl. As a consequence, fentanyl is now the No. 1 cause of overdose deaths in the United States,\" he said.\n\nAmid this public health crisis, the music world also lost pop legend Prince, who died of an accidental fentanyl overdose on April 21, 2016.\n\nEdward Berthelot/Getty Images\n\nAnd in 2017, 21-year-old rapper Lil Peep \u2014 a rising star known for blending hip-hop with emo sounds, who had been open about his struggles with addiction \u2014 shocked his young fans when he died of an accidental overdose of fentanyl and a generic brand of Xanax.\n\n\u201cPeople with addiction use a lot of drugs and they know how much they can use safely. When they die, unless they\u2019re suicidal, it\u2019s always because didn\u2019t know what they were using,\u201d Herzberg said.\n\nAccording to a study in JAMA Network Open, published this year, the number of opioid-related deaths in the U.S. has more than quadrupled in the past 18 years.", "description": "Investigators announced charges against three men in the overdose death of Mac Miller, alleging they distributed counterfeit pharmaceutical pills containing fentanyl.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/miller-1-gty-er-191020_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
