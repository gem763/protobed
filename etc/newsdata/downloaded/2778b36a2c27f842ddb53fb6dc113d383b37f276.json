I Have One Child.", "language": "en", "text": "Read: The miscarriage taboo\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t know then is that my experiences were not unique. At lunch following my third miscarriage, a friend noticed my sullen expression and asked me what was wrong. I finally and unexpectedly opened up and talked about what was happening. She put her arm around me and welcomed me to the club. She\u2019d had two miscarriages. And two healthy kids. And like me, she\u2019d also felt completely alone, her self-worth degraded.\n\nWe do not talk openly about miscarriage and fertility in America, and yet miscarriage is more common than the flu. One in six women will miscarry during their lifetime, and there isn\u2019t a singular reason. Most often, the cause is a chromosomal abnormality\u2014something goes haywire as the embryo divides\u2014that has nothing to do with the health or age of the parents. For women who know they\u2019re pregnant, nearly 20 percent of their pregnancies end in miscarriage. Sometimes it happens during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and sometimes it happens much further along.\n\nI\u2019ve been pregnant nine times, and I have one child. For years, I never told anyone about my miscarriages, because as a professional American woman, I\u2019d been indoctrinated to mute the implications of my gender. I should never hint at the idea that my body is capable of reproduction or that I might someday want to start a family. In a business setting, I learned that the mere mention of pregnancy could mean losing a potential client, or being passed over for a promotion or project. This wasn\u2019t merely anecdotal. I observed it firsthand, many times.\n\nLast year, riding the Acela between New York and Washington, D.C., I was seated at a four-top table with the head of human resources from a large investment bank, and he spent the entire commute working with his colleague on ways to legally fire a co-worker because she had the gall to take parental leave. Never mind that she was eligible for 12 weeks and only took three. There would be no way for her to catch up to the rest of the team, he argued. And what if she decided to have another baby? Best to \u201cpull the weed now before she spoils the whole garden,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile I was waiting in line to collect my winter coat after a professional event in New York, two men behind me were trying to decide on a new hire. The woman under consideration had an incredible track record at her previous job, had won a prestigious industry award, and fit in very well with the culture of the organization. But there was a big, insurmountable problem in their eyes: She was in her mid-30s and recently married, which obviously meant she was actively trying to get pregnant. She\u2019d get that \u201cfuzzy pregnancy brain,\u201d and then her productivity, no doubt, would wane. Before I\u2019d even handed over my ticket to coat check, they\u2019d decided on the male candidate, whom they\u2019d described as less impressive\u2014but also less inclined to reproduce.", "description": "Americans need to normalize conversations about pregnancy loss.", "authors": ["Amy Webb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/HIRES_Atlantic_Miscarriage_Pauliina_Holma_2880x1620/facebook.jpg?1571661696", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
