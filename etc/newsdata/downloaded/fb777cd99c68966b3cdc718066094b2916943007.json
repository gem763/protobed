Gavin Newsom and set to take effect in 2023, could upend amateur sports in the U.S. and trigger a legal challenge.\n\nNewsom and others cast it as an attempt to bring more fairness to big-money college athletics and let players share in the wealth they create for their schools. Critics have long complained that universities are getting rich off the backs of athletes \u2014 often, black athletes struggling to get by financially.\n\n\u201cOther college students with a talent, whether it be literature, music, or technological innovation, can monetize their skill and hard work,\u201d the governor said. \u201cStudent athletes, however, are prohibited from being compensated while their respective colleges and universities make millions, often at great risk to athletes\u2019 health, academics and professional careers.\u201d\n\nNewsom predicted other states will introduce similar legislation.\n\nThe NCAA \u2014 which had called on him to veto the bill, arguing that it would destroy the distinction between amateurs and pros and give California an unfair recruiting advantage \u2014 said it is considering its next steps. It did not elaborate.\n\nIn a statement, the NCAA said it is working to revise its rules on making money off a player\u2019s name and likeness. But it said any changes should be made at the national level through the NCAA, not through a patchwork of state laws.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s law applies to students at both public and private institutions \u2014 but not community colleges \u2014 in the nation\u2019s most populous state. While the measure covers all sports, the big money is in football and basketball.\n\nStudent athletes won\u2019t get salaries. But under the law, they can\u2019t be stripped of their scholarships or kicked off the team if they sign endorsement deals.\n\nThere are some limitations: Athletes can\u2019t enter into deals that conflict with their schools\u2019 existing contracts. For example, if your university has a contract with Nike, you can\u2019t sign with Under Armour.\n\nThe law represents another instance of California jumping out in front of other states when it comes to social and political change. The movement to allow student athletes to profit from their labors on the court or the playing field has been simmering for years, portrayed as a matter of economic fairness and civil rights.\n\n\u201cA majority of these athletes, it\u2019s no secret, are African American,\u201d said Sen. Steven Bradford, a co-author of the bill who is black. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of fairness, and it\u2019s an issue that has been long overdue.\u201d\n\nNewsom tweeted a video showing him signing the law during a special episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Shop: Uninterrupted\u201d alongside NBA superstar LeBron James, one of many professional athletes who have endorsed the measure.\n\nJames, whose 14-year-old son is a closely watched basketball prospect in Los Angeles and will be 18 when the law takes effect, exulted over its signing on Instagram, saying it will \u201cchange the lives for countless athletes who deserve it!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNCAA, you got the next move. We can solve this for everyone!\u201d\n\nNBA rookie Jordan Poole of the Golden State Warriors also welcomed the new law. Six months ago, as a player at the University of Michigan, he hit a game-winning shot at the buzzer in the second round of the NCAA tournament as millions watched on TV.\n\n\u201cI know for sure I would have been using my name after that Houston shot,\u201d he said, adding that letting athletes make money on endorsements is \u201chuge for the game.\u201d\n\nBefore the governor signed the law, the NCAA threatened to bar California universities from competition, meaning powerhouses like the University of Southern California, UCLA, Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley, could find themselves banned.\n\nIf that were to happen, California schools could form a new governing body and get schools from like-minded states to join, in a threat to the NCAA\u2019s dominance.\n\nBut the governor, a former college baseball player, said he doubts the NCAA would kick California schools out, arguing that the state\u2019s 40 million people and status as the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy make it too big to lose.\n\nThe NCAA \u201ccan\u2019t afford to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Nancy Skinner, the bill\u2019s author, said it could especially help female athletes, who have limited opportunities for professional sports once they leave college.\n\n\u201cCollege is the primary time when the spotlight is on\u201d them, Skinner said. \u201cFor women, this might be the only time they could make any money.\u201d\n\nNCAA rules bar players from hiring agents. The NCAA has also steadfastly refused to pay players in most cases. But a committee is studying other ways players could make money. Its report is expected in October.\n\nThe NCAA does let some athletes accept money in some instances. Tennis players can accept up to $10,000 in prize money per year, and Olympians can accept winnings from their competitions. Also, many schools pay players yearly cost-of-living stipends of $2,000 to $4,000.\n\n\u201cWe just kind of joked every kid is going to want to go to college out here in Cali now,\u201d Warriors forward Glenn Robinson III, who played college ball at Michigan, said of the new law.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time. A lot of people are waking up and starting to see how much money that these universities are making off of players,\u201d he added. \u201cWhere I went to school, a lot of players couldn\u2019t afford lunch.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Defying the NCAA, California opened the way Monday for college athletes to hire agents and make money from endorsement deals with sneaker companies, soft drink makers, car dealerships and other sponsors, just like the pros.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Adam Beam"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/UCLA_Arizona_Football_49072.jpg-45a59_c0-0-1957-1141_s1770x1032.jpg?b3b373af3138810aed4fbbc35bc9cd51b125daff", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
