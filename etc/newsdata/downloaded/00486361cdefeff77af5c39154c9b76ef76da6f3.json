She\u2019s won two Emmys for her roles in Nurse Jackie and Godless and been nominated for another. She plays Detective Karen Duvall in the new Netflix series Unbelievable opposite Toni Collette, and it\u2019s among Wever\u2019s best work to date \u2014 she is by turns ramrod stern, endlessly compassionate, dedicated, confident, questioning, self-berating, and meticulously professional. But talking about all of this superb acting is making Wever miserable.\n\n\u201cI am working very hard on finding a way to somehow make it less tortuous,\u201d she says, on a recent walk in Prospect Park, during which she is repeatedly, deeply apologetic about the heat. It is more than 90 degrees in Brooklyn today, and she\u2019s the one who suggested we take a stroll. Every time we turn onto a pathway with no shade, she is full of self-recrimination. But she does not want to be mistaken. \u201cI know how lucky I am. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m so nervous about bombing this opportunity.\u201d\n\nUnbelievable is a more \u201cactive\u201d role for Wever, as she puts it. She and Collette play detectives working ceaselessly to track down a serial rapist. Her earlier characters may have been \u201cdoing something,\u201d but she often felt they were designed to react to others. Still, Wever is adamant that Detective Duvall is not the lead of Unbelievable, that the \u201cheart\u201d of the show belongs to Kaitlyn Dever, who plays a young woman whose rapist was never caught because police decided she made the story up. But if Dever is the heart, Wever and Collette are Unbelievable\u2019s twin motors. The show, which carefully dismantles the institutional, exploitative, male-coded politics that define most crime shows, is fueled by their competence and simmering fury.\n\nPushing focus away from her central role in Unbelievable is also, of course, a way to deflect attention. The spotlight does not come easily to Wever, though her discomfort with it is endearing rather than gruff. When she won her first Emmy in 2013, her entire acceptance speech was 18 words: \u201cThank you so \u2014 oh no! Thanks so much. Um, thank you so much. Um, I gotta go. Bye.\u201d \u201cMy mind went blank,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything else that I was capable of, I promise you that.\u201d And then, because I asked her about the Emmys speech, she half-laughs and half-groans, \u201cI am so unhappy right now.\u201d\n\nI try to distract from how intensely I can see that Wever hates talking about herself. It never works. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend that there\u2019s a large part of me that actually wants to divulge anything,\u201d she tells me. \u201cConversation is easiest when you\u2019re being honest. I\u2019m hesitant of being completely honest, because I all of a sudden got this vision of a strong wind blowing leaves off the tree, and I\u2019m like, Things are leaving and I can\u2019t get them back!\u201d\n\nShe fears that if she explains her process out loud, that suddenly her skill will evaporate. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a suspicious person, but I don\u2019t trust that it will always be there when I need it to be, and therefore, I\u2019m scared,\u201d she explains. \u201cIs this conversation going to give it away, and then it won\u2019t be there for me in two weeks when I need to go to work?\u201d Nonetheless, she is remarkably forthcoming about how much terror and stress and anxiety she feels about her job. \u201cSelfishly, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to work this hard for decades and then be so racked every time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense and it\u2019s just not worth it and it\u2019s so fucking unpleasant and it honestly gets in the way of work. This is supposed to be a good thing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like walking around next to an exposed nerve. At one point, I ask whether she worries that a role like Unbelievable will only bring her increased attention. She says she tries not to think about it, much like she tries not to imagine the kinds of roles it might open up for her. \u201cI am not a dreamer,\u201d she says. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be lovely to be in the moment so much that I don\u2019t even comprehend what the idea of dreaming is? I\u2019ve tried to become more like that because I\u2019m told that\u2019s the path to enlightenment, clarity. Just goddamn basic survival.\u201d But she hasn\u2019t really succeeded, because no matter what either of us say, she can\u2019t forget that she\u2019s walking around with me while I ask her questions.\n\nSometimes, when she\u2019s acting and it\u2019s going well, she does manage to escape her constant self-awareness. \u201cIt is a feeling that is close to divine, spacious freedom. You know when you\u2019re in the moment and it actually feels honest or true,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThat feels almost divinely spiritually fulfilling to me.\u201d The problem is what happens next: \u201cIt leaves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear I may be constitutionally incompatible with my job sometimes,\u201d she concludes, near the end of our walk. It must be a real mindfuck to wonder if you\u2019re constitutionally incompatible with a job you\u2019re really good at, I point out. \u201cThank you for the hidden compliment at the end of that sentence,\u201d Wever replies, \u201cbut I found all of my life to be a mindfuck. And the truth is, it wouldn\u2019t matter if I didn\u2019t want to be desperately good at my job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing, this job,\u201d she continues. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to find a way to be as human as you can at every second in very inhuman circumstances.\u201d\n\nEventually, finally, we walk out of the park. \u201cHey,\u201d she says, just as we start to head in separate directions. \u201cThanks for your patience. Sorry for the fucking 90-degree walk. Real ridiculous idea. It\u2019s over. You wore breathable fabric and I\u2019m happy for you. I\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d", "description": "The new Netflix drama Unbelievable proves that Merritt Wever is a star.
