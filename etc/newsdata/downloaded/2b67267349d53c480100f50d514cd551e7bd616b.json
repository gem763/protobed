In early October, Mr. Xi would be the host of a grand celebration to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, along the Street of Eternal Peace, near my apartment.\n\n\u201cYou need to leave,\u201d Officer Wang said. \u201cArmed police will be stationed inside for four days.\u201d\n\nAs an American journalist based in Beijing for the past four years, I am accustomed to onerous visa rules, hassles at the airport and arbitrary detentions in the countryside.\n\nBut never had the police insisted on occupying my home.
