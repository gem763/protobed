After they informed him that he was being terminated, Gruden thanked them for the opportunity and left.\n\nAwful on field and directionless off, Redskins need to face a hard reality\n\nThough Snyder had been more appreciative of Gruden than many of his other head coaches, the team\u2019s owner has been described as increasingly frustrated over Gruden\u2019s inability to get back to the playoffs after winning the NFC East in 2015. Snyder decided to keep Gruden in January after the team finished 7-9 for a second straight season, but told associates he would make a change if Washington lost four games early in the season.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDan\u2019s just fed up,\u201d a person familiar with Snyder\u2019s thinking said this summer.\n\nAD\n\nSnyder chose not to fire Gruden after a Week 4 road loss to the New York Giants, but decided to make the move coming out of the Patriots loss and ahead of a road matchup with the winless Miami Dolphins. Snyder and Allen left FedEx Field almost immediately after the loss to New England Sunday.\n\nThe team released the following statement Monday morning in announcing Gruden\u2019s firing: \u201cThrough the first five games of the 2019 season, the team has clearly not performed up to expectations, and we all share in that responsibility. Moving forward we are committed to doing all that we can collectively as an organization to turn things around and give our Redskins fans and alumni a team they can be proud of in 2019 and beyond.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the locker room after Sunday\u2019s defeat, Washington running back Adrian Peterson expressed frustration over the team\u2019s performance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that something has to change,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing you do know, because we are 0-5. We haven\u2019t won. We haven\u2019t been productive as an offense. You got to go back to the drawing board and say, \u2018Okay, as a coaching staff . . . what can we do better to put our players in better position to be productive as an offense, to be better as a defense?\u2019 It\u2019s their job to do that. We 0-5. What we\u2019ve been doing, obviously, isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nCallahan, who has been with Washington since 2015, also has previous experience working with Allen with the Oakland Raiders, where Callahan was the offensive coordinator and later the head coach and Allen was a senior executive. Callahan also served as the head coach at the University of Nebraska for four seasons before successful stints at offensive line coaches for the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys.\n\nAD\n\nGruden, who had been an offensive assistant for his brother Jon with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later the offensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals, was seen as one of the league\u2019s brightest offensive minds when Snyder hired him in 2014. Early on, his offenses did well, especially late in the 2015 season when quarterback Kirk Cousins led a late-season run to the division title and in 2016 when Washington had the third-most yards in the NFL.\n\nAD\n\nBut his teams often had defensive breakdowns. He had three defensive coordinators in less than six years and while the defense was supposed to be the strength of the team the last two seasons, Washington struggled to make key stops late in games.\n\nEven Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 how many Patriots fans were at FedEx Field\n\nMostly, though, his teams were damaged by critical injuries, none more devastating than quarterback Alex Smith\u2019s likely career-ending broken leg in November 2018. At the time the Redskins were 6-3 and seemed headed to the playoffs. But then Houston\u2019s J.J. Watt landed on Smith, causing the quarterback\u2019s leg to snap \u2014 an injury that ultimately required several surgeries to remove infections.\n\nAD\n\nTwo games after Smith went down, backup quarterback Colt McCoy broke his leg as well, and Gruden had to finish the season with two quarterbacks who had been out of football. Washington finished the season 1-6 and is 1-10 after Smith\u2019s injury.\n\nAD\n\nBut there were other injuries as well, often depriving Gruden of key players. His best playmaker on offense, tight end Jordan Reed, has missed large parts of several seasons with a variety of injuries including seven concussions, the last of which kept him out all of this year. Running back Derrius Guice, drafted in 2017 to be a key piece of the Redskins offense, tore his ACL in his first preseason game a year ago and injured his meniscus in this year\u2019s season opener. Linebacker Reuben Foster, expected to be a key part of this year\u2019s defense, was injured on the first play of offseason practices and was lost for the year.\n\nThe Redskins finished the last two seasons with 23 players on injured reserve and already have 10 on this year\u2019s list.\n\nAD\n\nTwo disputes between team executives and top players likely hurt the Redskins\u2019 performance during Gruden\u2019s tenure. Washington used the franchise tag on quarterback Kirk Cousins for two straight years, angering Cousins, who eventually left in free agency after the 2017 season to join the Minnesota Vikings. Seven-time Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams has held out all of this year, so far refusing to play for the team, because of frustration with its medical staff.\n\nAD\n\nGruden has generally shrugged at the things that have gone wrong, and many around the team say his even-tempered personality kept the team from collapsing.\n\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s worse things to do in life than coach a football team,\u201d Gruden said recently. \u201cI enjoy coaching, love coaching, like the players and I like the staff that we have and I hate losing. [I\u2019m] miserable losing, because you put so much time and effort into it and players are working hard, but at the end of the day once you lose the game you got to refocus and get your mind right and get ready for the next one.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe coach had taken a slightly more resigned tone following the loss to New England, saying: \u201cIf the key works on Monday, I\u2019ll keep working.\u201d\n\nGruden is Snyder\u2019s eighth coach in 20 seasons and the seventh to be fired. In addition to being Snyder\u2019s longest-tenured coach, he is also the only one to get a contract extension, having two years added to his five-year, $20 million deal in 2017 \u2014 two years before his original contract expired. He was only five games into that extension when he was fired.\n\nKareem Copeland contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nThree takeaways from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to Patriots\n\nPatriots\u2019 offense \u2018can be a lot better,\u2019 Tom Brady says after big win over Redskins\n\nSteelers quarterback Mason Rudolph knocked out, hospitalized after\n\nAD", "description": "Gruden, the first NFL head coach to be fired this season, had been the longest-tenured coach of Daniel Snyder\u2019s two decades of ownership.
