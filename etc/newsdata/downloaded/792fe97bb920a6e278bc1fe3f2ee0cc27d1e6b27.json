He is widely regarded as a reservoir of the party's institutional memory.\n\nWhat is this role?\n\nThe DA's constitution states the person in this position is \"entrusted with and responsible for the organisation and administration of the party, and for developing and maintaining a high degree of efficiency in the party\".\n\nThis person must implement decisions of the federal council and federal executive, work closely with the federal leader, federal chairperson, federal chairperson of finance, and chief executive officer and perform other functions and duties and exercises powers assigned to him or her, within the provisions of this constitution by the federal leader, federal council and federal executive.\n\nIt is a role similar to that of the ANC's secretary general, albeit that the DA has a different party structure and does not prescribe to the Soviet doctrine of democratic centralism like the ANC.\n\nThis means the DA's different structures have a bit more autonomy than that of the ANC. It is viewed as a key position in the party structure - an integral cog in the party machinery.\n\nHow does this differ from the federal chairperson?\n\nBeing the chairperson of the federal council is a more hands-on job in the day-to-day running of the party than that of the federal chairperson. The chairperson of the federal council has a firmer grip on the party's machinery.\n\nThe federal chairperson is very much a deputy to the federal leader.\n\nThe DA constitution prescribes the following tasks for the federal chairperson:\n\nPresides over the federal congress;\n\nDeputises for the federal leader if he or she is absent or incapacitated;\n\nPerforms whatever tasks and functions are delegated to him or her by the federal council or federal executive from time to time;\n\nIs responsible for the co-ordination and alignment of party policy.\n\nWhat is the DA's federal council?\n\nIt is the party's policy-making and governing body when the federal congress is not in session.\n\nThe federal council consists of the following:\n\nAll members of the federal executive (often referred to as the FedEx);\n\nChairperson of the federal legal commission;\n\nThe provincial chairpersons and provincial chairpersons of finance;\n\nRegional chairpersons of the party in whose area of jurisdiction at least 80 000 votes were cast for the DA at the most recent national election;\n\n24 MPs;\n\n24 MPLs;\n\n24 local government councillors;\n\n24 DA members who are not public representatives;\n\nAny additional members, up to six, co-opted by the persons referred to above, subject to a two-thirds majority of the federal council meeting approving each co-option by secret ballot;\n\nTwo staff members from each province designated by the provincial chairperson, without voting rights.\n\nThe federal council must meet at least three times a year at times and places determined by the chairperson, and is obliged to do so by the decision of the FedEx or when requested by a petition signed by at least 30% of its members.\n\nHow does this differ from the FedEx?\n\nThe FedEx performs the functions and exercises the powers of the federal council when the council is not in session, but only the full federal council may approve candidate selection regulations and any amendments thereto and any political performance assessment system for public representatives.\n\nThe FedEx consists of the following:\n\nThe federal leader;\n\nThe federal chairperson;\n\nThree deputy federal chairpersons;\n\nChairperson of the federal council who also chairs FedEx meetings;\n\nTwo deputy chairpersons of the federal council;\n\nThe leaders of the party in the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces if they are not already members (in this case Mmusi Maimane is already a member, as he is the DA's leader in the National Assembly);\n\nThe federal chairperson of finance;\n\nProvincial leaders;\n\nDA chief whip in the National Assembly;\n\nFederal leader of the DA Youth;\n\nDA Student Organisation (DASO) federal leader;\n\nFederal leader of the DA Women's Network (DAWN)\n\nChairperson of a structure recognised by the federal council which represents the MPLs of the party;\n\nChairperson of the Association of Democratic Alliance Councillors;\n\nChief executive officer, without voting rights;\n\nSix members co-opted by a two-thirds majority of the federal executive by secret ballot.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The position the DA's chairperson of the federal council is currently a hot topic after former DA leader and Western Cape premier Helen Zille announced that she will contest this position.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1162/2a5be863da844ea184ff156a28373d31.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
