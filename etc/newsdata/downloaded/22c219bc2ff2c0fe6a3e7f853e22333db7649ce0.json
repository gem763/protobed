Vasip Sahin told reporters at the scene. The high-speed train transits that station without stopping.\n\nPrivate NTV television said at least two cars derailed. Parts of the overpass collapsed onto the train.\n\nSahin initially said four people were killed in the crash. His office later issued a statement saying seven people were killed in the crash, including the high-speed train's engine driver. Three of the injured passengers were in serious condition.\n\nTelevision footage showed emergency services working to rescue passengers from wrangled cars and debris.\n\nRescue teams were looking for more survivors, Sahin said.\n\n\"Our hope is that there are no other victims,\" he said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if a signaling problem caused the crash. Sahin said a technical inspection has begun while NTV television, quoting unnamed officials, said three prosecutors were assigned to investigate.\n\nIn July, 10 people were killed and more than 70 injured when most of a passenger train derailed in northwestern Turkey, after torrential rains caused part of the rail tracks to collapse. Last month, 15 people were injured when a passenger train collided with a freight train in Turkey's central province of Sivas.\n\nKonya, about 260km south of Ankara, is home to the tomb of the Sufi mystic and poet Jalaladdin Rumi, attracting thousands of pilgrims and tourists.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Turkish officials say that a high-speed train hit a railway engine and crashed into a pedestrian overpass at a station in the Turkish capital Ankara, killing seven people and injuring 46 others.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8305/5a6c22621fbf41a58da6cd05d7429242.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-13"}
