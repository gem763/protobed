Foreign media and most Chinese reporters are given no access.\n\nOn the day the plenum ends, the official Xinhua news agency will issue a long dispatch with details of what was agreed. To portray party unity, there will be no mention of any disagreements.\n\nPast plenums have been held under tight security at the Soviet-era Jingxi Hotel in western Beijing.\n\nThere has been an unusually long gap since the last plenum in February 2018. They normally happen in the autumn, but one did not take place then last year amid speculation about disagreement over policy among the senior leadership.\n\nHow significant are plenums?\n\nAfter the National Congress meetings, which are held once every five years, they are the most important gathering of the senior leadership in one place.\n\nThe mood at plenums can vary greatly, depending on the agenda.\n\nA plenum normally happens in the autumn, but one did not take place last year amid speculation of policy disagreements among the senior leadership [File: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters]\n\nA watershed conclave in 1978 overseen by Deng Xiaoping kickstarted China's economic reforms, beginning the transformation of the world's most populous nation from a centrally planned backwater to an economic powerhouse.\n\nAt the plenum in February 2018, the party approved a plan to remove presidential terms limits, meaning Xi could stay in office until he dies.\n\nThat change was formally signed off on in last year's meeting of China's largely rubber stamp parliament.\n\nAt a plenum in 2013, China unwrapped its boldest set of economic and social reforms in nearly three decades, relaxing its one-child policy and further freeing up markets to put the world's second-largest economy on a more stable footing.", "description": "President Xi to preside over highly-secretive meeting of powerful 370-person Central Committee that sets policy agenda.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/72fd6802060b4436b69e44ff45ee7cc9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
