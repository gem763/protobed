If someone like that could prove they are able to run a club in the right way, then Arsenal may look towards that eventually.'\n\nQuestions have been raised as to whether Emery can guide the club back into the Champions League places with Leicester, Chelsea and Tottenham seen as more likely contenders to secure a top-four spot.\n\nThe Gunners have just two wins from their last five games and are four points outside the top four positions, heaping pressure on Emery ahead of Wednesday night's trip to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup.\n\nEmery took the side to the Europa League final last season, losing to Chelsea in Baku, and Winterburn feels another season outside the top four could cost him his job.\n\nEmery's record at the club is positive but failure to get top four could cost him his position\n\nWinterburn (pictured in 1998) feels that the Spaniard has been given funds and must deliver\n\n'I would think that if Arsenal don't get into the top four there will be a review,' he added.\n\n'They can't get into the same position as with Arsene Wenger where 50 per cent of the supporters want him to stay and the other 50 per cent want him out and every time something goes wrong on the pitch it's almost as if the supporters are in crisis with each other.\n\n'It wasn't pleasant sitting and watching those games at the very end of Arsene's reign. It was very uncomfortable as a former player to watch on from the sidelines.'", "description": "Patrick Vieira has been backed as the man to replace Unai Emery should the club seek a managerial change this season, according to former team-mate Nigel Winterburn.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/20369794-0-image-a-30_1572432154107.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
