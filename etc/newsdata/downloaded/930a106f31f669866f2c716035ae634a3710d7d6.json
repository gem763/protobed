Castro\u2019s Biden attack means Democrats are now going to have to decide.", "language": "en", "text": "Now critics and even the media are debating the fairness of pointing out Biden\u2019s age \u2014 and the challenges that may present. (Castro, after the debate, said he was \u201cfact checking\u201d Biden. He also said Friday that his questioning Biden\u2019s memory had nothing to do with the former vice president\u2019s age.)\n\nThe Fix: Julian Castro goes there on Joe Biden's age\n\nThe Fix\u2019s Aaron Blake wrote last month about Biden\u2019s recent, frequent flubs on the campaign trail and why they matter to his candidacy. That context was the backdrop for when, in a back-and-forth over health care, Castro accused Biden of not remembering what he had said moments before.\n\n\u201cYou just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in,\u201d Castro charged.\n\nThere were audible groans in the audience. That Castro was incorrect about what Biden had said didn\u2019t help his argument, and it probably further muddles the debate over whether a candidate\u2019s age is fair game.\n\nThe blowback continued after the debate in the spin room and on social media.\n\nFormer White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter found Castro\u2019s comments so unacceptable that he suggested the former San Antonio mayor end his bid for the presidency.\n\nCastro made a fool of himself with this silly personal attack. He needs to go. We should hear more from \u2066@ewarren\u2069 and others who focus on policy and on Trump. https://t.co/N1WCd9yLtm \u2014 Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) September 13, 2019\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) defended Biden on CNN.\n\n\u201cI just thought that \u2018this is not cool,\u2019\u201d she said before arguing that President Trump has made personally attacking opponents the new normal in presidential campaigning. \u201cI thought that was so personal and so unnecessary.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who has been willing to attack Biden on his record plenty, though not on this issue, was the only other candidate who backed up Castro. \u201cI think we are at a tough point because there are a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball across the finished line without fumbling,\u201d he said on CNN after the debate. \u201cAnd I think Castro has some legitimate concerns.\n\n\u201cHe has every right to call him out,\u201d Booker added.\n\nWhen Castro was asked in follow-up interviews about bringing up a question that implicated Biden\u2019s age, he tried to say he did not.\n\n\u201cNumber one, he couldn\u2019t hear me in the auditorium,\u201d Castro said of Biden. \u201cSecondly, look, that\u2019s a question that I would ask any opponent in a debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vice president, is, you know, I mean, he\u2019s been around for a long time. Okay, when we\u2019re up there, we\u2019re up there to debate,\u201d he added. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter that it was Joe Biden. If it had been another candidate who tried to deny what they said just two minutes ago, I would have asked them the same thing.\u201d\n\nWhile the candidates deliberated on the aftermath of the elephant in the room having been addressed, on social media, the conversation turned to the appropriate way to do so: What\u2019s legitimate criticism or areas for concern when it comes to a 76-year-old man who seems to frequently stumble over words and facts \u2014 where does that veer into ageism?\n\nA lot of people consider Biden\u2019s mental sharpness \u2014 and his argument that he is the best candidate for the job \u2014 fair game. Thursday was not the first time that questions about the former vice president\u2019s acuity have arisen.\n\nAt the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention in August, Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), who is also running for president but was not in Thursday night\u2019s debate, appeared to allude to Biden\u2019s sharpness.\n\n\u201cIt is a concern you\u2019re hearing from a lot of people in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s unclear sometimes \u2015 when [Biden] is articulating positions, there\u2019s a lack of clarity. And I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\n\nBut plenty of people on Twitter also questioned whether attacking Biden the way Castro clearly did \u2014 alluding to his age \u2014 was fair game.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a cheap shot. Julian Castro had a good point. If Biden can\u2019t remember what he said a few minutes before he doesn\u2019t belong on a presidential debate stage. That\u2019s fair game. Let\u2019s take off the kid gloves. https://t.co/uNpDBPPcRT \u2014 Adam Best (@adamcbest) September 13, 2019\n\nApril Reign, an activist who focuses on diversity and inclusion issues, argued that Democrats critical of Castro never would have had a problem with the line had it not been used on the former vice president.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, if Biden (or any other candidate) had used Castro\u2019s \u2018two minutes ago\u2019 line on Trump, every Democrat in America would be calling it a strong line,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cIf you want someone tough to go after Trump, they have to prove their mettle against their fellow nominees. Grow up.\u201d\n\nOther liberals said the response to Castro \u2014 especially from establishment Democrats and leaders in the mainstream media \u2014 was revealing of something else. Preston Mitchum, who teaches health law and policy at Georgetown University Law Center, told The Fix that Castro\u2019s response to Biden in a conversation about health-care policy appeared to be about silencing valid criticism.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit layered when you think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cCastro is Latinx. There is a tendency among some white people to believe that there is a particular way that people of color should respond to older people, to white people and in particular to older white people, so I was not surprised when I saw the reaction of folks who said that he was \u2018nasty.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat could certainly be part of the dynamic. But Castro\u2019s question may have opened the floodgates on a topic that the media and other candidates have been reluctant to tackle head on. Now that it has been broached, it will be interesting to see if either are more willing to keep going there.", "description": "", "authors": ["Eugene Scott", "Reporter Covering Identity Politics For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-13-2019/t_5c6d53d23227417397c8dcf4df49d22c_name_20190912_castro_biden_v1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
