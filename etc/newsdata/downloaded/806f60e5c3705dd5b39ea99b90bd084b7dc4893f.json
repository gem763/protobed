They were led to certain death,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. Test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification.\u201d\n\nThe president said the \u201cthug\u201d spent his last moments \u201cin utter fear, in total panic and dread.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe raid reportedly was carried out by an attack of a squadron of eight helicopters and a warplane north of the Syrian town of Idlib.\n\nIn addition to providing a symbolic and strategic victory in the war on terrorism, the operation\u2019s success is major political boost for Mr. Trump, who has faced heavy criticism for ordering a recent pullback of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. The move had resulted in some IS prisoners escaping during a Turkish military offensive in the region, and raised fears of the extremist group regaining strength.\n\nMr. Trump said of the terrorist leader, \u201cHe died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nThe president characterized al-Baghdadi\u2019s death as the ultimate justice for years of Islamic State atrocities around the globe, from inspiring terrorist attacks agains the West to public beheadings, forced religious conversions and torture. He called IS \u201camong the most depraved organizations in the history of our world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what he wanted. This is what he was proud of,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe was a sick and depraved man. And he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump defended his graphic account of al-Baghdadi\u2019s demise, saying potential terrorist recruits should know that he died as a coward instead of a hero.\n\nThe president watched much of the secret raid on a video feed in the highly secure, underground Situation Room at the White House on Saturday night. With him were Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien and other military chiefs.\n\n\u201cThis raid was impeccable,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt was like you were watching a movie. Many of his people were killed. We lost nobody. The K-9 was hurt, went into the tunnel.\u201d\n\nHe said U.S. forces had al-Baghdadi under surveillance for about two weeks, and that several other attempted raids were canceled when the terrorist leader changed his movements.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for him for three years,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI started getting some very positive feedback about a month ago.\u201d\n\nHe said the operation involved flying over territory controlled by Russia, and that the U.S. notified Russians in advance of the mission without telling them the precise objective.\n\n\u201cIt was a secret mission,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe flew very, very low and very, very fast. We met with gunfire coming in, but it was local gunfire. That gunfire was terminated immediately, meaning they were shot from the airships.\u201d\n\nThe president said he notified very few congressional leaders until the operation was completed, and pointedly said that he didn\u2019t tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat.\n\n\u201cWashington is a leaking machine,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
