Any attempt to spin this report as evidence of good practice risks delaying government action, thereby putting more lives at risk,\u201d he said.\n\nQatar imposes a ban on outdoor work between 11.30am and 3pm from mid-June to the end of August, but the UN research found that those working in the sun are at a high risk of heat stress from as early at 10am.\n\n\u201cI worked on a construction site for two years, and sometimes these companies don\u2019t care,\u201d one worker from Kenya told the Guardian. \u201cThey just say \u2018go work\u2019 in the sun \u2026 We tried to complain but they say \u2018if you don\u2019t work, you\u2019ll get no salary, no ticket home and we won\u2019t give you food\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe UN study found that on average more than 40% of workers were dehydrated by the end of their shift, a figure that rose to 74% among the farm workers. The report cited better access to drinking water as one of the most effective strategies to reduce the risk of heat stress.\n\nSudden deaths of hundreds of migrant workers in Qatar not investigated Read more\n\nConditions were better for workers employed at the World Cup stadium site, where a number of heat mitigation measures are in place, including more freedom to take rests when workers choose. No case of heat strain had been reported at the stadium clinic since 2017, the report said.\n\n\u201cOne of the key reasons why workers on the World Cup site were at low risk to occupational heat strain was because they were empowered to self-pace and take breaks,\u201d said Dr Andreas Flouris, head of the FAME Laboratory, which carried out the research.\n\nHowever, World Cup stadium workers make up only around 1.5% of the migrant workforce in Qatar. The rest may face conditions similar to the farm workers, who were at \u201cmoderate to high risk of heat strain\u201d.\n\nThe report\u2019s recommendations include changes to the summertime working hours ban, mandatory heat stress mitigation plans for all companies and annual health checkups for workers.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the government to translate the recommendations of this study into improved legislation, and to promote the replication of the good practices that were identified,\u201d said Houtan Homayounpour, the head of ILO in Doha.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A third of workers in study experienced dangerously high body temperatures, despite working ban during hottest periods", "authors": ["Pete Pattisson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34b96427b73952fba30d430e9ce1cd7a8d84bc04/375_1112_4366_2620/master/4366.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a060f27b1d1baaec263c6fdd66cdcd71", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
