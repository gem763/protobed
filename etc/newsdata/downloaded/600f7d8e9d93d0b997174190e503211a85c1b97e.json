A day later, after an emergency meeting at the White House with his inner circle, Mr. Trump declared the U.S. \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and ready to respond.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s assertive reaction was peppered with qualifiers\u2014the U.S. intelligence still needed verification, he didn\u2019t know what Riyadh knew, or how Saudi officials wanted to proceed. Since then, the emphasis has been on building a case with allies and others on Iran\u2019s responsibility for the attacks and on signaling that sanctions on Iran will be stiffened.\n\nOn Wednesday, Saudi Arabia said it held Iran responsible for the attacks but didn\u2019t directly accuse it of conducting them. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the attacks \u201can act of war,\u201d though his remark was part of a speech about the need to pull together a coalition at the U.N., an institution Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized and that his administration has rarely turned to for help and at times openly undermined.\n\nFears of a military conflict between the U.S. and Iran are high following an attack on a critical Saudi oil facility Saturday. WSJ\u2019s Gerald F. Seib highlights three reasons the U.S. is less likely than it once was to defend Saudi Arabia if that happens. Photo: Associated Press\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to build out a coalition to develop a plan to deter them, this is what needs to happen,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said aboard a flight to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to substantially raise sanctions on Iran. It was the first U.S. policy response to the attacks, but the administration didn\u2019t immediately say what steps it would take, or what more, if anything, it was planning.\n\nIn another sign that the administration is far from a war footing, Mr. Trump made the comments while in California, where he flew earlier this week for a multiday, previously planned campaign fundraising trip.\n\n\u201cThis president, he didn\u2019t want to go to war with anybody, OK? That\u2019s not his inclination,\u201d said Sen. James Risch (R., Idaho), the Foreign Relations Committee chairman. \u201cHe will do everything he can to avoid a kinetic engagement with another country.\u201d\n\nThere remains a possibility of a military response to the oil installation attacks, which caused the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, to suspend production of 5.7 million barrels of oil a day, more than half of the country\u2019s output and about 6% of the global supply.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aversion to a more bellicose response\u2014he publicly rebuked Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) after he advocated for a military response against Iran\u2014aligns with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to foreign policy and his distaste for military adventurism in the Middle East.\n\nMr. Graham suggested on Tuesday that the U.S. should respond by bombing an Iranian oil refinery. He has counseled Mr. Trump that the attacks on Aramco were meant to test his resolve. On Wednesday, he said that a military response should be strong enough to \u201crestore deterrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be painful enough that they won\u2019t do it again,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\n\nBut Mr. Trump pushed back on Mr. Graham on Twitter and declined to weigh in on Mr. Pompeo\u2019s remarks in Riyadh, saying a statement would be coming later. \u201cWe have many options that we\u2019re considering,\u201d Mr. Trump said to reporters before heading to a campaign fundraiser in San Diego. \u201cThere are many options.\u201d\n\nIf a strike against Iranian interests happens, it is more likely to be measured and come from Saudi Arabia, with U.S. backing, than from the U.S. itself, according to interviews with administration officials and others who have been briefed on White House thinking.\n\nThe administration is also restricted in what action it can take. Mr. Trump is potentially hemmed in by a reluctant Congress, including many fellow Republicans. Some foreign allies are skeptical of U.S. intelligence that Mr. Pompeo used to finger Tehran on Saturday, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe strikes on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure have led to a production shutdown on a scale the world hasn\u2019t seen for decades. It could have long-lasting consequences for global markets and politics.

Although the U.S. is insulated from oil-supply shocks because it is now largely energy self-sufficient, the global economy remains a potential drag on U.S. growth, and Saturday\u2019s attacks prompted a major jump in oil prices. Any escalation in military conflict could drive prices higher for longer.\n\nThe administration\u2019s preferred option, according to multiple officials, remains a coordinated international response through the U.N., which gathers next week for its General Assembly in New York, where Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo are expected to make an appearance.\n\nThe turn to the U.N. was an unlikely wrinkle for the Trump administration, which has extensively criticized the institution. The U.S. withdrew from the Human Rights Commission last year, attacking it as a \u201chypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights,\u201d and relegated the post of U.S. ambassador to the U.N. to a level below the president\u2019s cabinet.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump spoke of the \u201cutter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations\u201d in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. \u201cThe United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it\u2019s not a friend to freedom, it\u2019s not a friend even to the United States of America,\u201d he charged.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Mr. Trump cited the \u201ctremendous potential\u201d of the U.N.: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt the United Nations is very important.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has, on occasion, utilized the U.N. In March 2018, the White House led the effort to impose a package of sanctions aimed at curtailing revenues for North Korea\u2019s ballistic-missile and nuclear programs.\n\nEarlier this week, during a U.N. Security Council session to address the situation in Yemen, U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft said Iran was responsible for the attack on two Saudi oil plants, and not the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen that claimed credit.\n\nTrump administration officials said there were 17 missiles used in the attack, which contradicted the Houthi claim that they launched 10 drones from Yemen. A separate oil facility was struck at least twice by precision-guided munitions, an administration official said.\n\n\u201cYou can demonstrate that the Houthi claim does not stand up to scrutiny,\u201d the official said.\n\nBut British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce said responsibility hadn\u2019t been determined. Japan and France have also signaled to the U.S. that they aren\u2019t convinced Iran was behind the attack.\n\nA British embassy spokeswoman in Washington said it was too early to say if, and how, the U.K. could join a diplomatic coalition to respond to the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe are still working to establish the facts of what happened, and I won\u2019t pre-empt next steps,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe will work with international partners to agree on the most effective response.\u201d\n\n\u2014Vivian Salama contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Michael C.
