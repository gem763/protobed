He had just seen Hamilton. He was feeling patriotic. He also \u2026 had zero idea Trump was that week\u2019s host, which sucks, especially for this noted lover of topical comedy. \u201cI had forgotten who the host was, because that host became the 45th president of the United States. He and his buddy Bill O\u2019Reilly were there,\u201d Hamm recalled on The Late Show. \u201cHe did the thing, where he shakes your hand and pulls you to try to get you off balance. I\u2019m 6\u20192 and 220 on a good day, you\u2019re not gonna get me off my pins.\u201d The canap\u00e9s? The drinks? The other disgraced hosts? Who knows. \u201cI didn\u2019t stay at the party very long.\u201d\n\nRelated", "description": "Jon Hamm recalled to Stephen Colbert the time he went to the SNL afterparty for Donald Trump when he hosted the show.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/28/5-hjamm.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
