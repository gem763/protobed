Then the pair spent most of it, police say.", "language": "en", "text": "Imagine waking up one day to find an extra $120,000 in your bank account. You did not make $120,000 or win $120,000, but there it is, $120,000, just sitting there. Cool!\n\nWhat would you do with all that cash? Pay off the mountain of student loans you\u2019d otherwise be stuck with till you die? Buy a house? Buy a car? Buy this weird-looking rich-people furniture?\n\nMaybe you should call the bank and find out what\u2019s going on?\n\nYeah. Yeah, you definitely should call the bank.\n\nRobert and Tiffany Williams of Montoursville, Pa., did not call the bank, police say.\n\nWhen a non-hypothetical $120,000 intended for a business was accidentally transferred into their BB&T bank account because of a teller error, the couple splurged on a camper, a Chevy and a racecar, state trooper Aaron Brown told the Williamsport Sun-Gazette. Authorities say they also distributed $15,000 to friends who needed the money.\n\nAll told, they spent $100,000 in about 2\u00bd weeks, WNEP reported.\n\nEventually, though, the bank contacted them on or around June 20 after sending the money to the correct account. The bank notified Tiffany Williams, 35, that they were responsible for returning all the funds, Brown told the Sun-Gazette. He added that the withdrawal resulted in a $107,416 overdraft because the couple\u2019s bank account had only $1,121 in it before the accidental windfall.\n\nBB&T Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTiffany first assured the bank she would work out a repayment plan with her husband, but she eventually ceased communications, WNEP reported.\n\n\u201cThat is kind of shocking, with all the procedures the banks have set up, checking and double-checking and triple-checking, there\u2019s no way anybody gets away with that stuff,\u201d Nate Weaver, a neighbor of the Williamses, told WNEP.\n\nThe Sun-Gazette reported that the couple, in separate interrogations, told police that they \u201cadmitted to knowing the mislaid money did not belong to them, but they spent it anyway.\u201d\n\nThe Williamses could not be reached immediately, and it was unclear whether they had retained legal counsel.\n\nThe couple now face three felony charges of theft and receiving stolen property, court records show. They appeared in court last week and posted bail of $25,000 each. The Pennsylvania State Police could not immediately comment on the case to The Washington Post.\n\nRead more:\n\nPlantations are talking more about slavery \u2014 and grappling with visitors who talk back\n\nFirst sisters to become Army generals say it was \u2018not a game of chance.
