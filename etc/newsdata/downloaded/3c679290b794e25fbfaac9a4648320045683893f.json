Well it wouldn\u2019t be a Hollyoaks stunt if Yazz wasn\u2019t in the firing line!\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nAs Nancy and Darren searched for missing Charlie and Ella, the kids managed to get out but as the caves collapsed, te exits were sealed off and Mandy and Darren were left injured under the falling rubble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, with Mitchell having refused to face the public by leaving the florist with Scott, the pair have been left staring death in the face. As members of the public including Mitchell\u2019s girlfriend Cleo (Nadine Mulkerrin) rush to the scene after seeing that there were people inside, will it be too late to save them?\n\nAnd will Tony be found before things get even worse for him? Charlie may well have spotted him in the back of the car \u2013 could it finally be time for Breda to be exposed?\n\nAnd, down in the tunnels, will their shared peril unite Darren and Nancy as they fight for survival?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A disaster has left five characters fighting for life.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Who-is-dead-in-Hollyoaks-stunt-57e6_1572365600.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
