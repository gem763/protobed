He\u2019s an Even Worse Entertainer.", "language": "en", "text": "Readers of this page have every reason to be suspicious of the political musings of an actor. I\u2019m suspicious of them myself. But consider this: Our politics and our press are completely dominated by an entertainer president. In recent weeks we\u2019ve even read about our ex-reality-show host president discussing foreign policy over the phone with the ex-TV comedian president of Ukraine.\n\nEntertainment and politics have become bizarrely intertwined. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a working entertainer to weigh in.\n\nI call Donald Trump an \u201centertainer president\u201d advisedly since he has proved himself to be such an inept public servant. Over the years, he has thrust himself into the public eye with the flamboyant histrionics of a latter-day P.T. Barnum. Part of this is the amoral tradecraft of a New York real estate developer, but a lot of it springs from the appetites of a voracious attention-getter.\n\nThink of Mr. Trump preening at his beauty contests, body-slamming Vince McMahon at W.W.F. events or holding rallies that resemble the arena gigs of an insult comic. These are the antics of a showman, not a statesman.", "description": "The performer in chief is forcing us to live in a B-movie horror.", "authors": ["John Lithgow"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/16lithgow/16lithgow-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
