It was like Kobe, LeBron and then I was right behind them. And I didn\u2019t make a dollar from it. But nor did I want to because I knew going into college what it was all about. I knew going to Florida, my dream school, where I wanted to go, the passion for it. If I could support my team, support my college, support my university, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. But now we\u2019re changing it from us, from we, from my university, from being an alumni where I care which makes college football and college sports special to then, OK it\u2019s not about us it\u2019s not about we it\u2019s just about me. And yes I know we live in a selfish culture where it\u2019s all about us but we\u2019re just adding and piling on to that. Where it changes what\u2019s special about college football. We turn it into the NFL where who has the most money, that\u2019s where you go. That\u2019s why people are more passionate about college sports than they are about NFL. That\u2019s why the stadiums are bigger in college than they are in the NFL. Because it\u2019s about your team, it\u2019s about your university. It\u2019s about where my family wanted to go. It\u2019s about where my grandfather had a dream of seeing Florida win an SEC championship. And you\u2019re taking that away so that young kids can earn a dollar and that\u2019s just not where I feel like college football needs to go.\n\nThe topic that spurred Tebow\u2019s rant was California\u2019s efforts to allow athletes in the state to make money through sponsorships and endorsements while still in school \u2014 something that\u2019s currently forbidden by NCAA rules. After passing through California\u2019s state legislature, the bill could be signed into law effective in 2023 by Gov. Gavin Newsom in the next few weeks.\n\nTebow\u2019s belief that he didn\u2019t want to make money on his jersey sales is certainly unique. And must only be tied to the time that he was in college. He\u2019s capitalized nicely on his time at Florida after he left the school with books, his ESPN gig as an analyst and numerous speaking engagements. He\u2019s made plenty of money off his career most known for being a Florida quarterback without receiving a dime from those jersey sales.\n\nAnd that capitalization on being one of the most famous quarterbacks in Florida history is well within his right. The four-year self-sacrifice for the greater good that he apparently passionately believes in has rewarded him with a financial windfall in his post-college career.\n\nNot every athlete has that opportunity to capitalize so richly on after-college life that Tebow does. And he should realize that.\n\nHe should also realize that the college sports reality that he describes doesn\u2019t actually exist, especially in football. With the NFL\u2019s age limit in place and no minor league system, college football has been the only way that high school football players have a chance of getting good enough to play professional football.\n\nAnd given that a small fraction of those college players will actually get to play pro ball, shouldn\u2019t they have the opportunity to be more fairly treated for bringing millions of dollars in revenue to their schools?\n\nThe selfish culture that Tebow thinks is pervading college athletics has been there for a long time too. What\u2019s more selfish than those in charge of athletic departments and football programs making six and seven-figure salaries \u2014 and being able to move freely from school to school for better jobs \u2014 while the players aren\u2019t allowed to financially capitalize on their name and likeness while they\u2019re in school and have to sit out a season if they want to transfer?\n\nThe only reason college athletes are treated the way they are is because that\u2019s always been the way it is. Thankfully, public opinion is helping to shift things slowly but surely towards more equity for athletes in the form of guaranteed scholarships and cost of attendance stipends.\n\nBut as California\u2019s bill shows, there\u2019s still a long way for college sports to go for athletes to be treated fairly. Tebow just may not appreciate the upcoming journey.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The former Florida QB and Heisman winner said efforts to more fairly compensate athletes were \"piling on\" to a \"selfish culture.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Pr0dc2xQpnG0BJ77dFnLVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDkuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kUZxVt3dV2j04XWb_gTrCw--~B/aD0yMzQ3O3c9MzMwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6d43b680-d651-11e9-9cf6-e7bc62a7517e", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
