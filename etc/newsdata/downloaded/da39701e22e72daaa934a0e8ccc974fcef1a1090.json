The electric, self-balancing skates cost $200 for a pair and is expected to launch in the spring\n\nAnd so far so good. In a demo for DailyMail.com, a Jetson employee was able to scoot around the CES floor with ease.\n\n'It's self-balancing and it feels very much like skates,' Michael Ruskin, vice president of operations at Jetson, told DailyMail.com.\n\n'I feel more in control than on a hoverboard because once you get the hang of it, you realize...it's just very simple movements.\n\nBut don't expect to ride a pair of hovershoes to work anytime soon, as they aren't great for riding on carpets or in the rain because they need traction to be stable.\n\nIn a demo for DailyMail.com, a Jetson employee was able to scoot around the CES floor. The shoes can go up to 7mph and have a rechargeable battery that lasts 6 miles on a single charge\n\nDon't expect to ride a pair of hovershoes to work anytime soon, as they aren't great for riding on carpets or in the rain because they need traction to be stable\n\nOne of the coolest hidden features of the hovershoes is that they turn into a roving boombox.\n\nWith the push of a button, music will start playing through the shoes with strobe lights flashing along with the beat.\n\nSo if you play some dubstep, the flashing lights will 'bump with the music,' Ruskin said.\n\nWhat's more, the hovershoes will soon be able to magically transform into a hoverboard and a go-kart.\n\nWith the push of a button, music will start playing through the shoes with strobe lights flashing along with the beat. So if you play some dubstep, the flashing lights will 'bump with the music'\n\nMotokicks aren't the first hovershoes to hit the market - Segway released its own self-balancing skates earlier this year. But Jetson's hovershoes still manage to stand out\n\nAt CES, Jetson also showed off its 'go-kart for adults,' an electric go-kart that uses a hoverboard as its base and can go up to 10mph.\n\nThe hovershoes themselves won't be available for purchase until later this year, according to Jetson.\n\nMotokicks aren't the first hovershoes to hit the market - Segway released its own self-balancing skates, called the Drift W1s, earlier this year.\n\nBut Jetson's hovershoes still manage to stand out, with unique features like the flashing LED lights that sync up with music, as well as the fact that they transform into a hoverboard.\n\nJetson told MailOnline that the Motokicks can also transform into a hoverboard, with the addition of a device that connects the two shoes in the middle. The shoes cost $200 a pair\n\nAt CES, Jetson also showed off its 'go-kart for adults,' an electric go-kart that uses a hoverboard as its base and can go up to 10mph. It also showed off other hoverboards\n\nAnd above all, they're really fun to ride, Jetson said.\n\n'[The hovershoes] are a toy and they're fun. That's what these are,' Ruskin said.\n\n'It's a new way for children and adults to experience mobility. Plus, it provides a real sense of freedom.'", "description": "A new pair of hovershoes unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show, called Motokicks, could soon replace your scooter, bike and skateboard - just don't try to take them for a spin in the rain.", "authors": ["Annie Palmer For Dailymail.Com In Las Vegas"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/21/8284978-0-image-a-3_1546984438040.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-08"}
