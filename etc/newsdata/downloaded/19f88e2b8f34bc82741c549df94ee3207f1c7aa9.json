Its parent took it private in June with a plan to re-list the firm in mainland China.\n\nLi added that the company did have its own shortcomings, having not aligned its pace of recruitment and managed its labor costs against the prevailing economic backdrop, which in turn led to funding issues. He said the company was now working with the government to try and find solutions.\n\nHe did not say when these issues had started but said the company aimed to resume normal payment of salaries in November. Complaints about late payments by the company began surfacing on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo platform as early as July, while local media reported last week on a worker protest at Hanergy\u2019s Beijing headquarters.\n\nLi added that the majority of Hanergy employees would retain their positions. He also said that company executives, including himself, would not take salaries for the time being and that he would not \u201crun away\u201d from the problems, saying that he had returned his U.S. green card a few years ago.", "description": "The founder of Chinese clean energy firm Hanergy Thin Film Power Group, Li Hejun, has apologized to the firm's 15,000 employees for late salary payments, blaming a slowing economy and other unexpected setbacks for the delay.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
