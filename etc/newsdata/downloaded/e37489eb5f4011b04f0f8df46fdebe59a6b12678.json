So he devoted Sunday night\u2018s episode of Last Week Tonight to the National Weather Service. Predicting the weather accurately is a multi-billion dollar industry that can save businesses and lives, which creates a lot of pressure on weathermen. \u201cThat is why they snap sometimes,\u201d says Oliver, showing a montage of a weatherman losing it on air.\n\nWhether you get your weather report from the local news or from an app, as Oliver notes, if you live in the U.S. your forecast would not exist without the National Weather Service, which generates a massive amount of data and gives it away, free of charge, to anyone who wants, including private companies. \u201cNational Weather Service data is to a weather forecast, what fresh wolverine meat is to Hormel Chili,\u201d Oliver says. \u201cYou can\u2019t make one without the other. It\u2019s the dominant ingredient.\u201d\n\nTo create all that data, the U.S. works with partners around the globe, which has worked well for the U.S., for instance when European forecast models showed Hurricane Sandy making a direct hit on New York, while U.S. models showed the storm heading out to sea. As Oliver points out, countless lives were saved due to the additional information.\n\nAccording to Oliver, private weather companies like Accuweather and Weather Channel can take the National Weather Service data, augment it, and make tailored predictions for specific clients. The relationship between the public and private companies has been mutually beneficial, but Oliver says there are tensions, too. For instance, when the National Weather Service names tropical storms it\u2019s to indicate to the public that they are strengthening and must be taken seriously. But Accuweather decided to name winter storms, even though they may not merit the serious attention that hurricanes do.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

For instance, they even reportedly worked to get a bill passed that would have prevented the National Weather Service from providing daily forecasts or putting content on its website. Luckily the bill failed, Oliver says because, \u201cWhat you do not want is a pay-walled system of weather where only paying customers can find out if they are about to drive into a tornado.\u201d\n\nNow, that nightmare scenario may be one step closer to reality and the National Weather Service may be under siege. That is because Donald Trump nominated Barry Myers, the CEO of Accuweather, a director competitor or the National Weather Service, to be the undersecretary of the National Weather Service. As TIME previously reported, \u201cMyers argued for new limits on what weather information the National Weather Service could release, leaving companies like his own with more control over the forecast, and greater profits. His appointment awaits a vote in the Senate.\u201d\n\nAs Oliver asks, \u201cWhy? Why not nominate any other guy?\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The late night host turns his attention to the billion dollar business that is weather forecasting.", "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1146142334.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
