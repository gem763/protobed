Lloyds had set aside \u00a3650m to cover PPI claims but warned on Monday that it will likely need an extra \u00a31.6bn to \u00a31.8bn to cover claims.\n\nAs a result of the unexpected charge, Lloyds has cancelled the remainder of its share buyback plan for this year. The bank was due to spend a further \u00a3600m buying back its own shares in the remainder of 2019.\n\nLloyds shares fell by 2% in early trade on the London Stock Exchange on Monday.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement means Lloyds has become the fourth major banking group to take a hit from the PPI deadline in the last week.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) said last Wednesday it would likely have to set aside an additional \u00a3900m to cover PPI claims. CYBG (CYBG.L), which owns Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank, and Virgin Money UK, said that it would have to set aside an extra \u00a3450m, while Co-op Bank said on Thursday that it received a \u201csubstantially greater volume\u201d of PPI claims without providing a guidance as to the cost.\n\nSpeculation is now mounting that rivals Barclays (BARC.L) and HSBC (HSBA.L) will also have to announce big provisions to cover PPI claims.\n\n\u201cIt looks fairly obvious to us that very significant increase in the complaints volume in August is what the broader industry experienced,\u201d UBS analysts Charmsol Yoon and Jason Napier wrote in a note to clients last week after CYBG announced its hit.\n\n\u201cWe see negative read-across to other UK banks, including Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC as reasonable, with updates from these banks looking increasingly likely.\u201d\n\nPPI was a form of insurance intended to help people maintain loan repayments if they fell on hard times. However, the product was aggressively marketed by banks in the 1990s and 2000s to help boost profitability. A 2011 court case ended the practice and opened the door for a wave of compensation claims from consumers.\n\nPPI was already the most expensive banking scandal in UK history and the string of recent provisions means banks have now spent over \u00a350bn on compensation and redress. Lloyds has taken the biggest hit, spending over \u00a320bn on PPI related costs.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOscar Williams-Grut covers banking, fintech, and finance for Yahoo Finance UK.
