And at this dangerous moment, President Trump has few options, few allies, a depleted national security team and little credibility.\n\nIt remained unclear for the moment why Iran or one of its proxies had apparently sought so great an escalation of regional tensions at this time. There was some speculation that hard-liners in Iran may be trying to torpedo any possibility of a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Hassan Rouhani. Whatever the immediate trigger, the attack on a major source of global energy was the most dangerous development since Mr. Trump repudiated the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran last year and began reimposing economic sanctions against Iran.\n\nThough Saudi Arabia was the target, the gauntlet was at Mr. Trump\u2019s feet, and the immediate question was how he would respond. Until the attack, the president had seemed intrigued by the possibility of meeting with Mr. Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly \u2014 that kind of head-to-head meeting with an adversary like Kim Jong-un of North Korea generates the lavish media attention Mr. Trump relishes.\n\nMr. Trump was silent for most of the weekend after the attack, and his response on Sunday evening was a remarkable tweet that the United States was \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d but that he was waiting to hear from Saudi Arabia on how to proceed. In the meantime, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was pointing the finger of blame directly at Iran for \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d while Tehran was denying his \u201cincomprehensible and meaningless\u201d accusations.", "description": "President Trump considers retaliation after the attack on Saudi oil facilities.
