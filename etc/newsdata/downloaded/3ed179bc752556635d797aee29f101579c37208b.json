The Thuraya X5-Touch, the world's first Android satellite phone.\n\nMust read: The 2019 iPhone 11 will be annoying, boring, and expensive\n\nThe Thuraya X5-Touch is a fully-ruggedized dual-SIM Android smartphone that offers access to GSM/LTE networks, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and satellite coverage (coverage map here, note that the satellite network does not cover North or South America \u2013 for this area you need a handset that accesses the Iridium or Inmarsat networks \u2013 but GSM coverage is available).\n\nThe X5-Touch features a 5.2-inch full HD touchscreen made of glare-resistant Gorilla glass, is powered by a Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor, 8-megapixel rear camera and 2-megapixel front camera, 16GB eMMC memory, 2GB of RAM, and runs Android Nougat 7.1.2.\n\nThe 3,800mAh battery is good for 11 hours of talk time and 100 hours of standby.\n\nStorage can also be expanded using the microSD card slot, but only by 32GB.\n\nA wide variety of accessories are also available, from docks to satellite chargers to external satellite antennas. Everything you need to stay connected when away from civilization.\n\nThe handset also has a dedicated SOS button, handy when you get into distress (perhaps when seeing the price or the cost of accessing the satellite network).\n\nFull spec here.\n\nThis handset is not cheap \u2013 priced around $1,250, and connecting to the satellite network is also scarily pricy, but for those who need the flexibility of an Android smartphone combined with satellite access when they are off the grid, this is a worthy combination. The handset is super-robust and will handle a level of abuse that would leave a regular smartphone in bits.\n\nSee also:", "description": "Need the ultimate Android smartphone for when you are on or off the grid?
