The Trump administration's tax cut fueled record levels of corporate buybacks in the second half of 2018, setting a high bar for the coming quarters to clear.\n\nThe healthcare industry contributed to more than half of the year-to-date drop in repurchase spending, Goldman said. The sector's firms bought $48 billion worth of shares in the first half of 2019 compared to $63 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nRead more: Buybacks have been keeping stocks strong for years \u2014 but the gig might soon be up for these 10 companies\n\nBuyback programs boost stock prices and earnings per share by reducing the number of shares in the market. They also symbolize heightened confidence from company leaders, as they expect the shares act as a strong investment and rise over time.\n\nA slowdown in buybacks could signal firms are less inclined to spend in the economic landscape, or that they don't expect the stock market to maintain its pace of growth. The repurchase decline coincides with weakening global economic growth, continued US-China trade tensions, and looming fears of recession.\n\nGoldman expects the decline to continue through next year, dropping another 5% to $675 billion in 2020.\n\nS&P stock repurchases \"seem to have peaked\" since the 2008 financial crisis, Jefferies analyst Sean Darby wrote in an early October note. He said the largest declines stemmed from utilities and healthcare firms, mirroring Goldman's analysis.\n\nBuyback programs also face new headwinds from political scrutiny. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Marco Rubio are among the legislators opposed to share repurchases, and each has pitched plans to halt the practice.\n\nThough the bank expects buyback spending to weaken though 2020, the analysts expect S&P companies to boost dividends by 5% next year. Investors looking for steady yield amidst the buyback slowdown \"should consider\" discounted dividend stocks, the analysts wrote.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nThe Fed's $60 billion monthly cash injections aren't enough to solve recent money-market stresses, JPMorgan says\n\nGold prices have soared 20% this year.
