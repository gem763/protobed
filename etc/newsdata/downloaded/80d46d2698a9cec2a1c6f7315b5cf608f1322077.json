Achillea said stones were thrown at Pajetat before Yeovil scored a second-half penalty and that the Cameroonian goalkeeper\u2019s head was spat upon. The referee allegedly confirmed to Haringey staff that a water bottle hit Pajetat, and a plastic beer bottle was also thrown in the player\u2019s direction. After the penalty was scored, Rowe was allegedly racially abused.\n\n\u201cIf the stand we have taken helps other clubs and stops other people from being abused then it\u2019s all been worth it, whatever the personal cost to all of us,\u201d Achillea told the Guardian. \u201cI hope it makes people sit up and take notice. It will be worthless if nothing comes of this that changes people\u2019s perceptions and attitudes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Haringey Borough and Yeovil abandoned their FA Cup tie on Saturday.

It was incredible to see because there was a lot of support from our fans. There was a big round of applause but it\u2019s reached the stage where people have realised somewhere something has to be done but unfortunately it happened to us in the most prestigious cup competition in the world. It upsets and worries me immensely about the future.\u201d\n\nAchillea said he sympathised with Yeovil\u2019s \u201cexceptional\u201d players and staff, and that they agreed the game should not have continued, and reiterated that \u201ca small minority have tarnished\u201d the National League club\u2019s reputation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to be thrown out of the competition, I don\u2019t know if Yeovil are going to be thrown out of the competition or if the FA are going to order a replay,\u201d he added of the fourth-qualifying-round tie. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened before, so all I can do is leave in the hands of the FA to do what they think is right.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Haringey Borough chairman Aki Achillea, pictured here in 2018.
