But, he said, based on \u201cthe totality of the evidence\u201d he thought the former officer was justified in shooting Botham Jean, whose apartment she says she entered after mistaking it for her own.\n\nThe judge ordered that Miller would not be allowed to say that in front of a jury, but said he would be allowed to testify regarding a narrow range of issues related to officer distraction.\n\nThe jury then heard around five minutes of testimony on day six of the trial before being sent home.\n\nGuyger, 31, who is white, is on trial for murder after she shot Jean, 26, who was black, in September last year. The accountant was alone in his apartment when Guyger came through his front door.\n\nOn Friday, Guyger testified that she mistook Jean\u2019s fourth-floor apartment for her own, which is one floor below. She said she parked on the wrong level of the apartment complex and walked through the unlocked door, thinking it was her own.\n\nShe said she killed Jean in self-defense, mistakenly thinking he was a burglar who would harm her.\n\n\u201cI hate that I have to live with this every single day of my life and I ask God for forgiveness, and I hate myself every single day,\u201d Guyger told the jury.\n\nThe jury will consider whether Guyger is guilty of murder, a lesser crime such as manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, or if she is not guilty.\n\nOn Saturday, they heard again from David Armstrong of the Texas Department of Public Safety, for about five minutes. He said Guyger may not have had a normal perception in the tense situation.\n\nAs with Miller, Armstrong told lawyers he believed Guyger\u2019s actions were reasonable. The jury was not present for that remark.\n\nJurors will report back to the court on Monday.", "description": "Craig Miller tells lawyers but not jury about \u2018inattentional blindness\u2019, regarding case in which officer says she mistook deceased\u2019s apartment for her own", "authors": ["Associated Press In Dallas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88838b476573e88c82995440834edc91bb12c092/0_149_5249_3150/master/5249.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e50fdcef165ec34b5e5bc7c0abc4b7a4", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
