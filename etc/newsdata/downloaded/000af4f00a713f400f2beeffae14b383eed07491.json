Neither US nor Chinese official figures are available.\n\nThe three-stage, solid-fuel missiles can carry a payload of 10 warheads each, Xu Guangyu, senior adviser to China's Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told China's state-run Global Times tabloid.\n\nThe Dongfeng-41 seen at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Tuesday.
