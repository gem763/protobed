Kurdish officials.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan's communications director confirmed that the country's military, together\n\nwith the Free Syrian Army, will cross the Syrian border 'shortly'.\n\nDonald Trump previously warned that he would 'obliterate' the Turkish economy if the country invaded north-east Syria, which is largely held by American-backed Kurdish forces.\n\nHowever, Washington appears to have subsequently softened its rhetoric, with a U.S Defense Department spokesman yesterday saying American troops were being withdrawn as a result of the anticipated Turkish strike.\n\nThe Turkish Defence Ministry said establishment of a safe zone is essential to contribute to stability and peace of the region and for Syrians.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty

for a Turkish incursion.\n\nBritain has raised concerns over the situation with both the Foreign and Defence Secretaries speaking to their US counterparts.\n\nForeign Office minister Dr Andrew Murrison said troop movements were a matter for the US.\n\nBut SNP foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins accused President Trump of \u201cbetrayal\u201d while Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry said he had \u201cshamed his office\u201d.\n\nUK minister Dr Murrison said military action \u201cmust be avoided as it would destabilise the region\u201d and harm efforts to achieve the \u201cenduring defeat of Daesh\u201d.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, former minister Tobias Ellwood warned the situation was a \u201cfundamental change in US foreign policy.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThese are not soldiers in uniform but radicalised extremists who are committed to pursuing their jihadist agenda.\u201d\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nThe withdrawal of American troops will leave Kurdish-led forces in Syria vulnerable to Turkish operations.\n\nAnkara has long viewed the Kurdish forces as terrorists.\n\nAll preparations for a possible military operation into northeastern Syria are completed, the Turkish Defence Ministry said in a Twitter post late on Monday.\n\nTrump's stern words seemed to be aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out U.S. forces.\n\nLeaders from both parties and both houses of Congress joined in the criticism, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump's fellow Republican.\n\n\"As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)\" Trump tweeted.\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nTurkey's lira slid more than two per cent to its lowest level in more than a month against the dollar on Monday over concerns about the planned incursion into northern Syria and Trump's warning.\n\nInvestors have been closely watching tense ties between Ankara and Washington in recent months, with the countries at odds over a range of issues, including Syria and Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defence systems.\n\nTurkey has repeatedly threatened to carry out an incursion against U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria who have links to Kurdish guerrillas operating next door in Turkey.\n\nThe United States began pulling troops back from the northeast Syrian border on Monday, effectively giving Turkey a green light to move into the area.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump said the United States should leave others from European allies to Iranian foes, \"to figure the situation out\" in the region.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter that \"it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\n\n\"WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\n\n\"Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.\"", "description":
