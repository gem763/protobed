(Atomic Energy Organization of Iran via AP)\n\nIran has activated a chain of advanced centrifuges to speed up uranium enrichment in defiance of a 2015 nuclear accord, a senior Iranian official said Saturday, raising the stakes for European powers struggling to prevent the deal\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe spokesman for Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization, Behrouz Kamalvandi, announced the new measures at a news conference in Tehran, warning that there was little time left to salvage the deal.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said this week that Iran would set aside the accord\u2019s restrictions on nuclear-related research and development and would expand its use of advanced centrifuges.\n\n\u201cThese steps are reversible if the other side fulfills its promises,\u201d Kamalvandi said, urging European nations to compensate Tehran following a U.S. withdrawal from the pact last year.\n\n\u201cWe cannot remain in the deal unilaterally,\u201d he said.\n\nThe landmark agreement was signed by Iran and world powers in 2015 and curbed Iran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for major sanctions relief. President Trump abandoned the accord and reimposed a near-total embargo on Iran\u2019s economy in the fall, frustrating European allies who helped negotiate the deal.\n\nUnder the agreement, Iran is allowed limited research and development on advanced centrifuges, which accelerate the production of fissile material that can be used to make a nuclear bomb. Kamalvandi said Saturday that Iran had begun injecting uranium gas into the centrifuges, which helps quicken the process. He said that the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, had been informed of the recent moves.\n\nIran has already exceeded caps placed on the size and purity of its enriched uranium stockpile, part of a strategy to place increasing pressure on Europe to reset the terms of the deal. Iranian officials say that they will reduce their commitments under the agreement every 60 days until Europe negotiates improved economic terms and offsets the effects of the U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn recent weeks, France has floated an initiative to grant Iran a $15 billion line of credit to make up for lost oil sales. As part of the agreement, Iran would return to full compliance with the nuclear deal.\n\nBut the Trump administration, which has embarked on a \u201cmaximum pressure campaign\u201d to isolate Iran, appears unlikely to greenlight the financial package. The United States has worked aggressively to halt Iran\u2019s oil exports, including issuing a warrant for an Iranian supertanker detained by Gibraltar in July.\n\nThe administration said that the vessel, Adrian Darya 1, was transporting oil to Syria and was therefore in violation of U.S. sanctions and subject to seizure.\n\nGibraltar released the tanker last month and it has been sailing through the Mediterranean Sea. Earlier this week, it turned off its transponder, according to open source shipping data.\n\nCommercial satellite images Friday appeared to show the vessel anchored near the Syrian port city of Tartous.\n\n\u201cAnyone who said the Adrian Darya-1 wasn\u2019t headed to #Syria is in denial,\u201d U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Twitter Friday, along with an image he said showed the tanker along Syria\u2019s coast. The image was taken by DigitalGlobe, a Colorado-based satellite imagery firm.\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "A spokesman for Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization announced the new measures at a news conference in Tehran.", "authors": ["Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bWOLRpx2rUv1Ed8-eNDERjpGn5o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VQ4L4PWRK4I6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
