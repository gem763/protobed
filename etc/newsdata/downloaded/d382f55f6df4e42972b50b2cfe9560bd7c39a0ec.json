Leading up the announcement, the German automaker boasted that a prototype version of the Taycan \u201cconquered\u201d the legendary N\u00fcrburgring-Nordschleife racetrack in Germany with a record time of 7 minutes and 42 seconds.\n\nWhile not really relevant to your average car buyer, beating the so-called \u201cGreen Hell\u201d racetrack is nevertheless an important feather in Porsche\u2019s cap as it seeks to market its new model as the fastest and most high-tech EV in its class.\n\nNo doubt this timing is completely coincidental\n\nIn what I assume is completely unrelated news, Elon Musk tweeted on Thursday that Tesla will be taking a Model S to the famed N\u00fcrburgring next week. There\u2019s no doubt that this timing is completely coincidental and has nothing to do with the release of another so-called \u201cTesla killer\u201d that critics claim will put Musk\u2019s company out of business.\n\nModel S on N\u00fcrburgring next week \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 5, 2019\n\nTo be sure, Tesla makes, dare I say, ludicrously fast cars. The performance version of the Model S boasts a 0\u201360 mph acceleration of 2.4 seconds, which is a hair faster than the 2.6 seconds that Porsche says its Taycan Turbo S takes to make a similar sprint. Whether Musk\u2019s car can take the 12.9-mile (20.8 km) track faster than 7 minutes and 42 seconds, though, remains to be seen.\n\nMusk was clearly watching the Taycan\u2019s debut with a high degree of interest. In addition to his N\u00fcrburgring tweet, the Tesla CEO also tweaked Porsche for naming the two versions of the Taycan \u201cTurbo\u201d and \u201cTurbo S.\u201d (The car does not actually have a turbocharger.) Musk seems to be spoiling for a fight, and depending on how well the Model S performs in Germany next week, it looks like he\u2019ll get one.\n\nUpdated September 6, 2019 2:56 pm ET: Tesla\u2019s track run is now a little less certain. A spokesperson for the N\u00fcrburgring told Road & Track that it hasn\u2019t received any request from the company, and may not be able to accommodate Tesla even if it had.", "description": "Elon Musk tweeted on Thursday that Tesla will be taking a Model S to the famed N\u00fcrburgring racetrack in Germany next week.
