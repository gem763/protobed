But, as reported by the journalist Judd Legum, in the last week the rules have narrowed considerably, only banning adverts that \u201cinclude claims debunked by third-party fact-checkers, or, in certain circumstances, claims debunked by organisations with particular expertise\u201d.\n\nShould Trump be banned from Twitter? Read more\n\nUnder Facebook\u2019s third-party fact-checking programme, it invites independent organisations such as the UK\u2019s Full Fact to verify claims posted to the social network. But the groups, made up mainly of small charities and nonprofits, are heavily constrained in how many claims they can fact-check, meaning they often only verify the most viral cases.\n\nBut even that limit has been lifted for political adverts. A separate policy introduced by the social network recently declared opinion pieces and satire ineligible for verification, including any website or page \u201cwith the primary purpose of expressing the opinion or agenda of a political figure\u201d. The end result is that any direct statement from a candidate or campaign cannot be fact-checked and so is automatically exempted from policies designed to prevent misinformation.\n\nThe changes, Legum reported, followed a run of Donald Trump adverts that contained false claims but were not removed under the old rules.\n\nThe new rules could prompt a clash between Facebook and UK regulators. The Advertising Standards Authority does not cover political adverts in Britain, the content of which is largely unregulated, but it does cover all other adverts, including those posted on Facebook. The ASA\u2019s code explicitly bans adverts that \u201cmaterially mislead or [are] likely to do so\u201d, language that is close to that used in Facebook\u2019s previous policies.\n\nFacebook\u2019s decision comes as the rival service TikTok takes the opposite stance. In a blogpost, the social network, whose reported 500 million users would make it the largest in the world not owned by Facebook, made clear it would not be hosting any political adverts.\n\nQ&A What is TikTok? Show Hide TikTok is a video-sharing app which has become phenomenally popular with teenagers. Users film themselves in 15-second clips, typically set to music, and upload them to be viewed by followers and strangers alike. It has been the No 1 app on the worldwide App Store for five consecutive quarters, with an estimated 500 million users worldwide. Owned by Chinese startup ByteDance, the app as it is today is a merger of the original TikTok, which was launched internationally in September 2017, and the viral sensation Musical.ly. The latter had already become one of the most popular social media platforms for UK and US teenagers by the time it was purchased by ByteDance in November 2017. The merger meant TikTok ended up on the smartphones of more than 60 million users overnight. Bytedance has a valuation of $75bn (\u00a360bn), based primarily on the extraordinary growth of TikTok and its Chinese equivalent, Douyin. Lil Nas X found fame overnight when his track Old Town Road was used extensively on 15-second clips on the social network. That enthusiasm took the artist to a record-breaking run at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, Bytedance was fined a record $5.7m in the US for illegally collecting personal information from children under 13, and has been under investigation in the UK for how it handles the personal data of its young users, and whether it prioritises the safety of children on its social network. Alex Hern, UK technology editor\n\n\u201cAny paid ads that come into the community need to fit the standards for our platform, and the nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience,\u201d wrote Blake Chandlee, the company\u2019s vice-president of global business solutions. \u201cTo that end, we will not allow paid ads that promote or oppose a candidate, current leader, political party or group, or issue at the federal, state, or local level \u2013 including election-related ads, advocacy ads, or issue ads.\u201d\n\nChandlee said the decision was prompted by TikTok\u2019s mission \u201cto inspire creativity and build joy\u201d. That same rationale had been cited by the company, which is owned by the Chinese startup Bytedance, to explain why it censored posts that went against the political orthodoxy of Beijing, mentioning topics such as the Tiananmen Square killings or the independence movement in Taiwan.\n\nWhen the Guardian revealed the censorship, TikTok said the rules had since been repealed and replaced with ones that \u201ctake localised approaches\u201d to \u201cprovide an app experience that fosters their creativity\u201d.", "description": "Firm quietly rescinds policy banning false advertising as UK general election looms", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069ee7920d903bf9978ce5e0c1f6b86b62602941/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=07270a4f9789bb6f0108d78e620060c0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
