It\u2019s a comfort blanket, and it feels easier to keep it in your hand to skip through all those poorly-chosen tracks on your workout playlist rather than having to pull it out of a pocket each time.\n\nOr maybe you don\u2019t have pockets in your running gear (a curse many of us live with) and can\u2019t be bothered to get one of those jazzy phone armbands.\n\nThe decision to just clutch your phone makes sense, but it is in fact a bad idea.\n\nWhy? It\u2019s not just because you\u2019re playing with the risk of dropping your phone and smashing its screen (although that\u2019s a real concern). A running expert has warned that this particular habit may be leading to an epidemic of hip and shoulder injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUK Athletics running coach Alexa Duckworth-Briggs says: \u2018It might seem trivial, but holding your phone while running could be setting you up for future injuries.\n\n\u2018When you hold something in our hands, there are subtle knock-on effects to your gait.\n\n\u2018It creates muscular imbalances, affects the distribution of weight across your body, and makes you a less efficient runner in general.\n\n\u2018This could be happening every time you train, week after week, month after month.\n\n\u2018And all of this means you\u2019re more susceptible to strains, particularly in your legs, hips and across your shoulders.\u2019\n\nWhen you hold your phone, you\u2019re adding a little bit of weight to one side of your body, and keeping your hand an arm in an unnatural position.\n\nThat can lead to you adjusting your weight in a damaging way, leaning, and injuring yourself as a result.\n\nHolding your phone could lead to injuries \u2013 for you and your phone (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nAn armband isn\u2019t the answer, though. You\u2019re much better off with a special waist belt, so your phone is in the middle of your body rather than weighing down one side.\n\nAlexa, who\u2019s also a coach with the We Run online support group, says that as mobile phones have grown bigger and heavier, the more injuries she\u2019s seen.\n\nShe explains: \u2018People tend to always hold their phone in the same hand. It\u2019s a force of habit.\n\nThe issue here is in the repetition of movement, with your arms swinging thousands of times during a 30 minute run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018By making one arm heavier, you\u2019re altering the momentum of your limbs. And your body will attempt to compensate for the imbalance by working certain muscles harder than others.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s where repetitive strain injuries will come into play.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d expect problems to manifest in the side of the body opposite to where you\u2019re holding your phone.\n\n\u2018Your arm and opposite leg go backwards and forwards in unison. So if you hold your phone in your right hand, you\u2019re most likely to have issues with your left leg and hip.\n\n\u2018I tend to pop my phone in a zip-tight freezer bag and put it in the waistband of my leggings,\u201d she says.\n\n\u2018But you can buy elastic belts that fit tightly around your waist or hips.\n\n\u2018There are some mobile phone carriers that strap around your arms but, again, I\u2019d say they\u2019d still leave you unbalanced. You\u2019re better off holding that weight centrally to your body.\u2019\n\nGoing for a belt or using that little pocket at the back of your leggings will prevent phone-induced injuries \u2013 and, of course, protect you from dropping your phone while you jog. Your sweaty hands paired with the motion of your jog make it all too easy for your phone to slip directly into a muddy puddle.\n\nDylan Bourguignon, CEO of phone insurance specialist So-Sure, says he\u2019s seen countless customers who\u2019ve smashed up their phones while working out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all too easy to lose grip of your phone when out running, particularly if you\u2019re jogging on uneven ground off-road,\u2019 says Dylan.\n\n\u2018And, as most of us are all too well aware, mobile phones don\u2019t bounce too well when dropped. They\u2019re even less happy submerged in a puddle.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had lots of cases where phones have also ended up in rivers and canals thanks to slippery fingers while running on towpaths.\u2019\n\nStick your phone in a belt or pocket to save yourself pain (both from injury and from having to fork out for repairs).\n\nMORE: The hottest fitness trends for 2020\n\nMORE: Ear tattoo inspiration: Everything you need to know about the dainty tattoo trend\n\nMORE: \u2018I had a stroke at 24 and it made me forget my baby daughter\u2019s name\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Holding your phone while jogging can cause issues for your posture.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ultra-runner_1570189848.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
