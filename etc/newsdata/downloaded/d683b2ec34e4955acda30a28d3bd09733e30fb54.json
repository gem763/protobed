Under the traditional model, ads are worked through separate creative and production departments and it can take a week or longer to get an approved ad.\n\nMyAdbox's platform is designed to cut out the production department function, which would normally take the creative\u2019s ideas and roll out advertising across mediums. It reckons it can get approved ads to market within minutes, making it more effective at responding to social media demands in particular.\n\nMyAdbox reckons it has about 40 per cent of Australian new car dealerships as subscribers on its platform. Bloomberg\n\nThe business was set up by two advertising agency executives and a software developer and launched in 2015 with a SaaS platform and focus on the automotive industry. It now has 24 clients, more than 12,000 users, produces more than 125,000 ads a year and reckons it has about 40 per cent of the country\u2019s new car dealerships on its platform.\n\nMyAdbox is seeking to ramp up its growth with a $6 million capital raising. Funds raised would be used to develop its platform, beef up its sales function and target other industries in the Australian market.\n\nPotential investors were told to expect MyAdbox to record $8 million revenue in the 2020, increasing to $22 million by the 2022 financial year. Importantly, the company forecasts $8.3 million EBITDA in 2022.\n\nMyAdbox has Lempriere Capital teeing up meetings with potential investors this month and calling for indicative non-binding offers mid November. Binding bids are slated for December.", "description": "A marketing tech business with a foothold in Australia\u2019s automotive sector is seeking to raise fresh funds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/976bfa1a89da1eb0374823986e6d82b38bdceb5e", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
