Back in July, Huawei accused FedEx of unauthorized re-routing of its packages which led to China investigating the US firm, just one day after announcing they will draft up an \u201cunreliable entity list\u201d of foreign companies. Whilst no company has been officially added to the list, one has to wonder if it is now just a matter of timing. And, technically speaking, now appears ideal with a potential swing trade setting up.\n\nSince breaking beneath 2016 low and out of a small bearish pennant, prices have retraced towards the resistance zone and printed a small, bearish pinbar. Whilst this may not mark the actual top, it shows a reluctance to push higher so perhaps bears can now carve out a swing high.\n\nThe bias remains bearish below 174.82 and we\u2019re waiting for bearish momentum to return to suggest the high is in place\n\nWhilst this could head towards 120 over the coming weeks if sentiment allows, we can use the monthly S1 around 133 as an interim target.\n\nA clear break above 147.82 invalidates the bearish bias and warns of a false break at the lows.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
