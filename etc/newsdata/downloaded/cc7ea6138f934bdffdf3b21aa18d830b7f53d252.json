It was unclear what the motive for the apparent sabotage was.\n\nOf the latest incident, the airline said: \"Cathay Dragon immediately reported the case to the Hong Kong Police, who have launched a parallel investigation into the matter. The Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department (CAD) has been informed.\"\n\nThe airline group, police and aviation regulators in Hong Kong and mainland China have been investigating the incidents since last month amid a crisis at the airline linked to anti-government protests gripping the city. Scores of Cathay Pacific staff have been dismissed over their support for the protests.\n\n\"The airline is taking the issue very seriously,\" the company said in a statement. \"Safety and security are always our greatest priority.\"\n\nCrew members typically use the canisters to move around the cabin in the rare event of an emergency depressurization.\n\nRead more: Hong Kong's government scraps the incendiary extradition bill that has sparked months of protests\n\nThe CAD, Hong Kong's aviation regulator, noted that the first six cases were uncovered either before or after a flight. The seventh, however, emerged during a mid-flight inspection, of the kind which both Cathay carriers had made hourly.\n\nThe department said it remained \"highly concerned\" about the spate of incidents, and that it had told Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon, after meeting their respective CEOs, to immediately improve safety inspections, though it did not specify what the demanded changes were. It added that Cathay flights would be subject to spot checks to ensure improvement measures were \"strictly enforced\".\n\nPolice confirmed they were investigating, adding that no arrests had been made.\n\nThe suspected sabotage of life-saving cabin equipment added to a litany of problems faced by Hong Kong's largest airline group, which includes cancelled bookings amid domestic unrest. Cathay Pacific has also had to contend with a safety warning from the mainland regulator, which prompted a collapse in demand for flights on its mainland Chinese routes, which make up a fifth of all its daily flights.", "description": "Police and aviation regulators have been investigating seven acts of apparent sabotage since last month.", "authors": ["Danny Lee", "South China Morning Post"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ce29d94021b4c0e41330685-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
