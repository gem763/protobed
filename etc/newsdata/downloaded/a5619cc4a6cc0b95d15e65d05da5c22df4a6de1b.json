Those affected include employees from Eats, performance marketing, Advanced Technologies Group and recruiting, as well as various teams within the global rides and platform departments. Some employees have also been asked to relocate.\n\n\u201cDays like today are tough for us all, and the ELT and I will do everything we can to make certain that we won\u2019t need or have another day like this ahead of us,\u201d Khosrowshahi wrote in the email. \u201cWe all have to play a part by establishing a new normal in how we work: identifying and eliminating duplicate work, upholding high standards for performance, giving direct feedback and taking action when expectations aren\u2019t being met, and eliminating the bureaucracy that tends to creep as companies grow.\u201d\n\nIn total, the layoffs represent about 1% of the company, an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch. All of this comes about one month after Uber laid off 435 employees across its product and engineering teams and less than three months after Uber laid off about 400 people from its marketing team. At this point, most departments at Uber have been affected by layoffs.\n\nFor Uber\u2019s self-driving car unit, this is its first round of layoffs since it spun out into its own unit earlier this year. Uber has previously said the team consists of more than 1,200 people and today still employs more than 1,200, despite the layoffs. according to an Uber spokesperson. Based on the terms of ATG\u2019s $1 billion fundraising round in April, the unit is worth $7.25 billion on a post-money basis.\n\nMore than 70% of those affected in this round of layoffs are based in the U.S. and Canada, and the rest are relatively evenly distributed across APAC, Latin America and EMEA. Uber notified those affected this morning.\n\nAs TechCrunch previously reported, these layoffs are a result of Khosrowshahi asking every member of his executive leadership team if they were to start from scratch, would their respective organizations look the way they do?\n\n\u201cAs you know, over the past few months, our leaders have looked carefully at their teams to ensure our organizations are structured for success for the next few years,\u201d Khosrowshahi wrote to employees. \u201cThis has resulted in difficult but necessary changes to ensure we have the right people in the right roles in the right locations, and that we\u2019re always holding ourselves accountable to top performance.\u201d\n\nIn Q2 2019, Uber lost more than $5 billion \u2014 its biggest quarterly revenue loss to date \u2014 though a chunk of its losses were a result of stock-based compensation expenses for employees following the company\u2019s IPO in May.\n\nIn other parts of Uber\u2019s business, it\u2019s continuing to invest money in ensuring its drivers remain 1099 independent contractors. Already, Uber, along with Lyft and DoorDash, put $30 million toward a 2020 ballot initiative that would enable them to keep their drivers as independent contractors. In light of gig worker protection bill AB-5 passing in the California State Senate and Assembly, Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West made it clear the company was willing to invest more money into that campaign initiative. California Governor Gavin Newsom has since signed that bill into law, which goes into effect January 1, 2020.\n\nWhile West said he believes Uber would pass the test and prove its drivers are properly classified, there would surely be a financial impact if Uber fails the test. West did not comment on what that impact could be, but industry analysts have estimated a change in classification for drivers could result in up to a 30% cost increase.\n\nUber will report its Q3 earnings on November 4. The company is currently trading at $31.26 per share, which is well below its IPO pricing of $45.\n\nBelow is Khosrowshahi\u2019s full email with the subject line, \u201cStronger moving forward\u201d:", "description": "Uber has just laid off around 350 employees across a variety of teams within the organization, marking what the company says is its third and final phase of layoffs of the process it began earlier this year, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said to employees today in an email obtained by TechCrunch (full email below).
