The cinematic dry season (post-Oscars, but before the good spring films arrive) is over, and the summer blockbusters have played themselves through. With another awards season on the horizon, it\u2019s fair to ask: Will we remember any of the year\u2019s early hits come February? Hard to say, but we can point to a few gems among the more conventional genre releases of 2019 so far: a politicized zombie slasher, a documentary about two nights at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church, a Swedish vacation turned living nightmare movie, the return of Quentin Tarantino, an Obama-produced Netflix film. Here are the best movies of the year that Vulture has reviewed, according to David Edelstein, Emily Yoshida, Bilge Ebiri, and Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n.\n\n(A quick note about our methodology: We\u2019ve restricted this list only to films that have had an official release in the first eight months of 2019, though we will continue to update it throughout the year.)\n\nPhoto: Armory Films\n\nEnjoyable and excruciating. In Joe Penna\u2019s survival drama, the riveting Mads Mikkelsen plays a man whose plane has gone down in the frozen wilderness. That\u2019s all we know about him and all we really need to \u2014 it\u2019s what he does and keeps doing that defines him. Thrown together with a grievously wounded, non\u2013compos mentis woman, he tugs her well-swaddled form on a sled into the unknown, trudging and grunting and falling and trudging and heeeaving and trudging and heeeaving \u2014 and just when we think it can\u2019t get more horrible, we realize that up until then he\u2019d had it easy. The movie really takes your mind off your own troubles. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Orchard\n\nSet in the north of Colombia among the indigenous Wayuu, Ciro Guerra and Cristina Gallego\u2019s knockout film is part ethnographic documentary, part The Godfather. Over 20 years (from 1960 to 1980), people whose ways first seem strange metamorphose into a familiar breed of narcos, moving tons of marijuana, and become avid materialists. As in Guerra\u2019s last film, Embrace of the Serpent, the disjunction between ancient ways and modern, ephemeral fashions and technology is not just jarring but toxic, a shock to the system that will almost certainly kill the host. The drive toward revenge kills the characters long before anyone dies. It kills their souls. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: David Bloomer/CTMG\n\nEscape Room didn\u2019t need to be good, and its release during the very first week of the year seemed destined to make it a 2019 B-movie footnote. But the ensemble thriller from Insidious and Paranormal Activity vet Adam Robitel is a whole lot of fun, throwing a group of strangers together into a hyperbolically lethal version of the titular team-building game. It\u2019s much more of a puzzler than it is a horror film, and Robitel doesn\u2019t need gore or jump scares to keep the whole thing tightly wound. The grand finale is so audacious that you\u2019ll be ready to buy a ticket for the sequel before the lights come up. \u2014E.Y.\n\nPhoto: United Artists\n\nThe unlikely collaboration between writer-director Stephen Merchant and executive producer the Rock is an unexpected joy \u2014 a true story that skips along its inspirational sports-movie template while finding real pathos and tough truths under all that sparkly spandex. As WWE champion Paige, Florence Pugh is equal parts ferocious and tender, a misfit struggling to find the right way to share her talents with the world. It\u2019s a WWE production, but if it\u2019s propaganda for the sport, it\u2019s the kind you\u2019ll gladly let win you over to the joyful absurdities of the sport. \u2014E.Y.\n\nPhoto: Music Box Films\n\nDirector Christian Petzold (Barbara, Phoenix) changes the time of Anna Seghers\u2019s 1944 novel, in which refugees from the Nazis stuck in Lyon wait for ships to North America: It\u2019s still Lyon, but the period trappings are gone and they\u2019re now fleeing all-purpose \u201cfascists.\u201d At the heart of the story is a slow-motion mistaken-identity farce in which a concentration-camp escapee, Georg (the charismatic Franz Rogowski, who bears a resemblance to Joaquin Phoenix), assumes the identity of a famous writer whom only Georg knows committed suicide \u2014 and then falls madly for the writer\u2019s discombobulated wife (Paula Beer). The physical, temporal, and emotional geography is very confusing, but the film is still potent. Petzold is part acrid realist, part romantic: His protagonists lose everything but their passion, emotion being the last refuge. \u2014D.E.\n\nIt\u2019s Step Up crossed with Battle Royale, a house-music Suspiria, and exactly as fun and harrowing as that description would suggest. French adulte terrible Gaspar No\u00e9 (Enter the Void, Love) brings together a vibrant ensemble of dancers led by dynamo Sofia Boutella for a party gone horribly awry thanks to some no-good sangria. In what feels like more-or-less real time, we watch a cohesive, unified group of very-much-alive young people devolve into screaming, hallucinatory chaos, all set to an incredible disco-techno soundtrack. No\u00e9\u2019s desire to shock is still ever-present, and all trigger warnings still apply. But the dizzying, acrobatic camerawork and the impressive physical and emotional work of Boutella and the rest of the cast make this his most crowd-pleasing \u2014 dare I say, even sentimental? \u2014 work yet. \u2014E.Y.\n\nPhoto: IFC\n\nA stunning platform for Mary Kay Place as a compulsive do-gooder out to expiate her sins as everyone around her is either dying (a first cousin with end-stage cervical cancer) or on the brink (her addict son and a slew of elderly friends and relatives). Kent Jones\u2019s drama \u2014 mostly naturalistic, but with the odd expressionist flourish \u2014 is generally regarded as one of the most depressing ever made, but once you accept its un-transcendent, death-centric baseline the movie is strangely exhilarating. In between scenes are shots taken through a windshield of rural landscapes passing in every season, with soft, haunting music by Jeremiah Bornfield, with the film\u2019s protagonist (like all of us) going from someplace to someplace on the road to who-knows-where. In its mundane way, Diane shows you glimmers of the sublime. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Magnolia Pictures\n\nAlison Klayman\u2019s On the Road With Steve Bannon doc is essential, sad to say, given that Bannon is not a fringe hate-monger but a man with the ears of protofascist, xenophobic movement leaders in the U.S., France, Belgium, Hungary, Germany, and the U.K., as well as sundry billionaires. Why would Bannon let Klayman be a fly on his wall \u2014 or in his ointment? He has faith in his message. He already has \u201ca solid enough minority that\u2019s immoveable.\u201d He just needs to sway an increasingly susceptible 15 percent of the rest, and he\u2019s excellent at making people feel as if they\u2019re being marginalized by a dark (in all senses) cabal \u2014 while he denies and denies and denies that he\u2019s saying what he in fact is. Klayman doesn\u2019t have to editorialize to make the point that Bannon is one of the most dangerous people alive. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: MK2 Productions\n\nJia Zhangke\u2019s epic revisits many of the themes he\u2019s explored throughout his past few films (Mountains May Depart, A Touch of Sin), particularly the near-absurdities of a rapidly changing modern China, and it\u2019s as profoundly wrought as ever. With Ash, however, there\u2019s a genre twist; a sort of pulp gangster romance shot through Zhangke\u2019s patient, wide lens. A deceptively steely Zhao Tao stars as a woman separated from the man who, for better or worse, is the love of her life, and sets out to find her way back to him over two and half decades. It\u2019s as much a story of a country rebuilding itself as it is of one woman doing the same, and by its gutting resolution you\u2019ll feel as if you\u2019ve walked those miles and years in Zhao\u2019s shoes. \u2014E.Y.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Universal Pictures\n\nA politicized zombie-slasher film in which subterranean doppelg\u00e4ngers \u2014 separate but mystically \u201ctethered\u201d to their aboveground analogs \u2014 swarm our world with scissors and the message, \u201cWe exist.\u201d Once you get over the disappointment that Jordan Peele\u2019s second feature isn\u2019t as trim or impish in its satire as his marvelous debut, Get Out, you can settle back and salute what it is: the most inspiring kind of miss. It\u2019s what you want an artist of Peele\u2019s sensibility and stature to attempt \u2014 to broaden his canvas, deepen his psychological insight, and add new cinematic tools to his kit. Fans will rewatch the film to savor the fillips, the purposeful echoes, and the \u201cEaster eggs,\u201d as well as a dual performance by Lupita Nyong\u2019o that\u2019s otherworldly in its brilliance. As the double, \u201cRed,\u201d she adopts a voice that\u2019s the whistle of someone whose throat has been cut, with a gap between the start of a word in the diaphragm and its finish in the head. It\u2019s like a rush of acrid air from a tomb. \u2014D.E.\n\nOver two nights in 1972, Aretha Franklin, then at the height of her fame, came to Los Angeles\u2019s New Temple Missionary Baptist Church to record a selection of gospel classics. The resulting album, Amazing Grace, was one of the most acclaimed of her career. Director Sydney Pollack documented both nights with a small array of 16 mm cameras, but the footage languished for decades until producer Alan Elliott bought it and put together this concert documentary, which was then further delayed by Franklin\u2019s own, somewhat surprising refusal to let it be shown. But now it\u2019s here, and it is transcendent. Resplendent in her caftans but otherwise humble, Franklin gives off no diva or rock-star airs. But as soon as she starts singing, she\u2019s in \u2014 eyes closed, head up, half-grins turning into flights of ecstatic joy. So is her audience, shouting their support, cheering her along, dancing in the aisles. And so are we. The movie itself feels like a church service, and it\u2019s enough to make you get religion. \u2014Bilge Ebiri\n\nPhoto: Kinology\n\nTerry Gilliam\u2019s notorious film maudit, three decades in the unmaking and already the subject of a 17-year-old documentary about the collapse of its production, is, uh, here. And it\u2019s surprisingly light on its feet. The story follows a slick commercial director (played by Adam Driver, an inspired choice) who returns to the Spanish village where he made his thesis film ten years ago, an adaptation of Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote, and discovers that the lives there were ruined by his production. Reuniting with the aging cobbler who played his Quixote (Jonathan Pryce), he discovers that the man still imagines himself to be the 17th-century knight-errant. Their ensuing journey mixes medieval gallantry, contemporary topicality, and typically Gilliamesque chaos \u2014 a swirling vortex of disguises, dream visions, broad humor, and a delightfully disorienting look at both the creative and destructive power of imagination. \u2014B.E.\n\nPhoto: Steve Dietl/Roadside Attractions\n\nMurderously hard to sit through, which is not something you\u2019ll see on top of an ad. Maybe that\u2019s why the film had been a commercial bust. But this portrait of Cameron Todd Willingham (Jack O\u2019Connell), a Texas ne\u2019er-do-well executed for burning his three little girls to death, is painstakingly well-made and important. The director, Ed Zwick, isn\u2019t cynical about the motives of the investigators who allegedly screwed up so badly in interpreting the evidence. The lie of most police dramas isn\u2019t that they\u2019re on the side of the angels \u2014 it\u2019s that they\u2019re always competent at what they do and that there are fail-safe mechanisms to keep innocent people from the death chamber. Laura Dern plays the divorced mother who volunteers to be a pen pal to someone on death row and gets sucked in when she reads the trial transcript. Dern is a great detective actress \u2014 she externalizes thought. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the Studio\n\nA coolly intelligent autobiographical film by the British writer-director Joanna Hogg, who doesn\u2019t often give you your narrative bearings \u2014 and spoils you for over-shapers, the spoon-feeders. Her protagonist (Honor Swinton Byrne, daughter of Tilda, who plays her mother onscreen) is a well-off, socially conscious 24-year-old film student who wants to make a movie about a boy growing up by the grotty docks near Newcastle but is thrown off course by her foppish, madly pretentious, and (as it turns out) heroin-addicted boyfriend (Tom Burke). At times the film seems too distanced, but it\u2019s never obvious or banal. Hogg convinces you that incoherence is the only honest way to tell a story with any emotional complexity. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Peter Prato/Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nThe Last Black Man in San Francisco is a testament to the power of human touch. Actor Jimmie Fails and director Joe Talbot\u2019s semi-autobiographical debut is a gorgeously wrought love letter to the city. The film follows Jimmie Fails (the character bears the name of the actor) as he fights to reclaim and tend for the home his great-grandfather built, going so far as to squat in the Victorian house with his artist friend Montgomery (Jonathan Majors). But his obsession with the home is based on a long-held lie; Jimmie\u2019s grandfather didn\u2019t actually build that house. Visually, the film is brimming with painterly tableaus of black life. It powerfully considers black masculinity as performance through a Greek chorus of men that veer in and out of Monty\u2019s and Jimmie\u2019s lives, but the movie\u2019s real potency derives from how it ponders the way geography acts as identity. Home is where our most deep-seated wounds lie. In the end, the crown jewel of the story is the tender, curious, and empathetic performance by Majors that\u2019s continued to haunt me for weeks. \u2014Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n\n\nPhoto: Csaba Aknay/A24\n\nGrueling, grisly, and full of white people wearing white in the Swedish summer solstice, Ari Aster\u2019s follow-up to the supremely un-fun Hereditary has a similar theme: the allure of an alternate family with clear-cut values. In this case, it\u2019s now a cult of radiant pagan Swedes who believe themselves in harmony with the natural world, who represent something harshly beautiful to the bereft American protagonist, Dani Ardor (the superb Florence Pugh). The most ambitious horror blurs the line between the psychological and the mythic, between ordinary human emotions and symbol-laden Blakean nightmares, and Aster is very ambitious and very blurry. But the blurriness is unnerving, the finale both horrific and strangely beautiful. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Neon\n\nHarsher and less formulaic than most Go-For-It movies, this story of an unstable, ex-con Glaswegian single mother named Rose-Lynn who longs to sing country music (not country-Western, she will hiss) is a great pedestal for the chameleon Irish actress Jessie Buckley. Buckley (who got her start in musical-comedy) has a first-class voice for country, with warm, slightly ragged chest tones that make the leap to high soprano with just a touch of effort, so that you feel the cost to the singer as well as her triumph. Directed by Tom Harper from a script by Nicole Taylor, the movie turns on whether Rose-Lynne (who longs to leave Glasgow and her family for Nashville) can be a proper mom to her two small children \u2014 which is also the key to deepening her artistry. With Julie Walters as Rose-Lynne\u2019s suffering mother and a cameo by the BBC 2 country DJ \u201cWhispering\u201d Bob Harris, who gently presses her say something personal with her songs. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the Studio\n\nA thrilling return to form for Brian DePalma \u2014 but also under-funded, shorn of nearly half its director\u2019s intended running time, and occasionally ludicrous. The convoluted, right-wing-ish story centers on two Danish cops: Christian (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, between seasons of Game of Thrones) and Alex (Carice van Houten, ditto) on the hunt for a Libyan immigrant (Eriq Ebouaney) who killed Christian\u2019s partner, who was also Alex\u2019s illicit lover. What they don\u2019t know is that the Libyan is being protected by the CIA (led by Guy Pearce), which tacitly approves of his locating, torturing, and killing ISIS operatives to get to the sheikh who murdered his father. What keeps you entranced is De Palma\u2019s pacing. In the key sequences, the action slows to a crawl \u2014 proof that the greatest suspense comes from helplessness in a world where you can see what\u2019s coming but can\u2019t think or move fast enough to forestall the horror. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Andrew Cooper/Columbia Pictures\n\nQuentin Tarantino\u2019s tenth film \u2014 starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton, a fading, alcoholic Western TV star and Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth, his loyal stuntman, driver, gofer, and one-man entourage \u2014 is a pastiche of \u201960s pop culture that transcends its inspirations: It\u2019s a farrago of genius. It plays as a series of entertaining digressions until its convulsively brutal climax, in which members of the Manson family approach the home of Rick\u2019s neighbor Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) for what we know going in will be the massacre that symbolically ended the hippie utopia. Has there ever been a finale simultaneously so euphoric and heartbreaking? Tarantino\u2019s dream world is a sadistic place, but in a way it\u2019s sublime, a heaven nestled inside hell. (Star-making turns: the lithe Margaret Qualley as a Manson girl and little Julia Butters as an endearingly serious child actress who penetrates Rick\u2019s shell of alienation.) \u2014D.E.\n\nCrawl\n\nPhoto: Sergej Radovic/Paramount Pictures\n\nCrawl is a great example of a simple story exceedingly well-told. It\u2019s a bloody adventure full of teeth-gnawing turns of fortune, mordant wit, vicious gator kills, and surprising tenderness \u2014 that clocks in at a blessedly fleet 87 minutes. It\u2019s a perfect horror film for the summer, as much an ode to the cataclysmic, humbling aspects of Mother Nature as it is a love letter to father-daughter relationships. The latter dynamic provides the film\u2019s tender through line, keeping us invested in the survival of the only main characters in the movie. Some of the most fun I\u2019ve had in the theater this season was watching Haley navigate creature-infested waters, balance trepidatiously on the sink as the waters rise, or with teary-eyed regret create a tourniquet for her gnawed thigh. Scodelario is great at communicating various levels of pain and discomfort as she traverses gross, grimy small spaces in order to survive. Crawl is a gut punch in cinematic form, a grimy ode to the Floridian environment, but none of it would work without her transfixing performance. \u2014A.J.B.\n\nPhoto: Good Deed Entertainment\n\nIn the bang-up debut by Jasmin Mozaffari, high-school grads Lou (redhead Michaela Kurimsky) and Chantal (Karena Evans) make strides to escape their rundown town and poisonous families. But the danger is everywhere, not just from predatory males but from themselves: They\u2019re of this culture and susceptible to it, no matter their smarts and resolve. Mozaffari dramatizes the illusory nature of control. Lou and Chantal have some but not a lot, and often the ways in which they try to get it back tightens the vise. You come away from marveling not at their strength but at their nonending struggle against weakness. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the Studio\n\nDeaths of children are the heart of Waad Al-Kateab and Edward Watts\u2019s first-person documentary of the 2016 siege of Aleppo \u2014 Sama being Waad\u2019s baby daughter, whose existence haunts Waad as she films her husband, Hamza (one of the few doctors remaining), as he attempts to save yet another bomb-mangled child. Much of the film takes place inside the hospital where Hamza will do 890 operations in 20 days, but it doesn\u2019t feel like raw footage \u2014 it has been carefully shaped. Watching the film, you feel it would be an act of cowardice to look away from even the most tragic sights. It\u2019s not propaganda but a mother\u2019s plea to bear witness. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nMarianne is Norwegian single mother Marianne Ihlen, whom Leonard Cohen immortalized in the loving breakup song \u201cSo Long, Marianne,\u201d after a relationship that began in the \u201960s in a period of creative ferment on the Greek island of Hydra. Nick Broomfield\u2019s documentary tells the stories of both Marianne and Leonard, though much of what Leonard says (in interviews and footage spanning half a century) is about Leonard and much of what Marianne says is about Leonard, too. Cohen emerges as a great artist and a limited man who admits that a large part of his life was about escaping from other people. But you still end up \u2014 especially when he performs \u2014 in his thrall. He reaches out to Marianne on her deathbed, telling his \u201cold friend\u201d that he won\u2019t be far behind (he wasn\u2019t) and wishing her \u201csafe travels down the road.\u201d \u2014D.E.\n\nOfficial Secrets\n\nPhoto: Nick Wall/IFC Films\n\nThe Brits do low-key, paranoid procedural dramas like this one so well, with a pervading chill and no flash. It\u2019s set in 2003 and 2004, before and after British intelligence analyst Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley) leaks a memo from the U.S. directing her agency to dig up dirt on members of the U.N. Security Council, to help \u201cpersuade\u201d them to authorize the invasion of Iraq. To determine the memo\u2019s authenticity, reporters led by Matt Smith and Matthew Goode have furtive meetings in clubs and on tennis courts with men who know something or know someone who knows something, while director Gavin Hood channels Alan Pakula with shots that suggest that someone\u2019s always watching. Ralph Fiennes plays the unemotive barrister who takes Katharine\u2019s case: One of the film\u2019s chief pleasures is seeing his faint quarter-smile as he tells her she\u2019s done good. \u2014D.E.\n\nPhoto: Amazon Studios\n\nNanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang\u2019s first-person documentary chronicles the effects of China\u2019s one-child law in infuriating, tragic, and grisly detail. It turns out that the 1985 policy ushered in (with cheerful, propagandistic songs, posters, and Chinese \u201coperas,\u201d many on display) an ongoing totalitarian nightmare, the scale of which is rarely appreciated outside the so-called People\u2019s Republic. You see trash heaps with bodies of infants sticking out of medical-waste bags and men and women still broken by the memory of forced sterilizations \u2014 or, worse, abandoning baby girls to die. A child born in the middle of the policy\u2019s implementation (it ended in 2005, when China found itself with a severely denuded next generation), Wang muses on the connection between governments that mandate abortions and those that prohibit it: Neither gives freedom of choice to the woman over her own body. \u2014D.E.\n\nAmerican Factory\n\nPhoto: Aubrey Keith/Netflix\n\nAn expansive, humanistic documentary set largely in Dayton, Ohio, where a closed GM plant is reborn as a Chinese-owned windshield factory, Fuyao Glass. Steve Bognar and Julia Reichert\u2019s film is incisive (sometimes hilarious) in depicting the culture clash between stubbornly individualistic Americans (slow, with \u201cfat fingers,\u201d according to Chinese executives) and ultradisciplined, anything-for-the-company Chinese workers. But the underlying story is grim: The Chinese idea of human workers as machine parts will yield soon enough to actual machines doing all the labor. It\u2019s the worst of communism (become a cog, a zombie drone) combined with the worst of free-market capitalism (you\u2019re expendable in all ways). This is the first Netflix film released under Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s Higher Ground banner. Too bad you can\u2019t see it in a theater. \u2014D.E.", "description": "Including the Rock\u2019s latest, \u201cFighting With My Family\u201d; Mads Mikkelsen\u2019s survival drama, \u201cArctic\u201d; and a tightly wound horror movie, \u201cEscape Room.\u201d", "authors": ["David Edelstein", "Emily Yoshida"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/29/29-best-movies-so-far.w1200.h630.jpg"}
