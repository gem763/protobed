Reservoirs are holding more water than normal,\" said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai.\n\nThe 2019 monsoon season got off to a bleak start with the driest June in five years and below-average precipitation in July, suggesting an initial prediction for lower than normal rainfall from the country's only private forecaster, Skymet, could come to pass.\n\nThe weather department had also said in May that rains this year would amount to 96 per cent of the long-term average.\n\nBut August saw heavy rains and flooding in some states and the strong monsoon has stretched into this month.\n\nWater levels in India's main reservoirs were at 89 per cent of their storage capacity as on Sept 27 against 74 per cent a year earlier, government data shows. The average for the past 10 years is 72 per cent.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [MUMBAI] Monsoon rains in India were 10 per cent above average in 2019 and the highest in 25 years as seasonal rainfall continued longer than expected, the weather department said on Monday. .
