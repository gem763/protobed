For those unfamiliar, Rhodes is the gruff head of the Oath Keepers \u2013 a militia made up largely of current and former law enforcement officials and military veterans, perhaps best known for the all-white contingent it sent to provide \u201csecurity\u201d for a rally in Ferguson in 2015. Now, the Oath Keepers are calling for volunteers to protect Trump supporters\u2014including at the president\u2019s rally Thursday evening in Minnesota.\n\nRhodes has maintained a relatively low profile recently, as has the broader militia movement, which saw an unprecedented spike under the Obama administration. But that doesn\u2019t mean America\u2019s militia movement has gone dormant since its groups maintained an outsized presence at the deadly 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, claiming they were simply there to try and keep the peace.", "description": "Stewart Rhodes is ready to protect Trump, no matter what, and to fight a HOT war.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1968,w_3500,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570730348/RTS12H0B_slyfj9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
