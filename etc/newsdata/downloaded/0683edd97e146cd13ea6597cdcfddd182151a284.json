Boeing has repeatedly said it hopes to resume flights in the fourth quarter, which began Oct. 1.\n\nRegulators sought to play down talk of transatlantic divisions over safety changes to the 737 MAX, which was grounded worldwide in March after two crashes killed 346 people within five months.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement it has a \"transparent and collaborative relationship\" with other civil aviation authorities as it continues its 737 MAX safety review. Its European Union counterpart said it was in \"continuous contact\" with both the FAA and Boeing.\n\n\"We do not at this stage have any specific concerns resulting from that assessment that would mean that we could not agree to a coordinated return to service. We are in continuous contact with both the FAA and Boeing,\" a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) spokeswoman said by email.\n\nFAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in September the agency would need about a month following the yet-to-be scheduled certification test flight before the planes could return to service.\n\nThe FAA reiterated on Tuesday that it does not have a firm date for completing its review.\n\nAmong its changes, Being is addressing a flaw discovered in the software architecture of the 737 MAX flight-control system that involves using and receiving input from both flight control computers rather than one.\n\nFor decades, 737 models have used only one of the flight control computers for each flight, switching to the other computer on the following flight, Reuters reported in August.\n\nFAA still needs to see Boeing\u2019s \"final system description\" - a \"500-ish page document that has the architecture of the flight control system and the changes that they have made\" Dickson said last month. It then will need to complete an \"integrated system safety analysis\" and conduct pilot workload management scenarios.\n\nBoeing plans to revise the 737 MAX software to take input from both angle-of-attack sensors in the anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes and has added additional safeguards.\n\nSouthwest Airlines Co is scheduling without the MAX until at least early January, pending regulatory approval for commercial flight. American Airlines Group and United Airlines have canceled MAX flights through part of December.
