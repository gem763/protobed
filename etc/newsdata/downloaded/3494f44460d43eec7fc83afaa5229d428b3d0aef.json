It's the fifth consecutive year of record STD rates. In the report\u2019s foreword, Gail Bolan, director of the CDC\u2019s division of STD prevention, noted that it wasn\u2019t long ago that \u201cgonorrhea rates were at historic lows, [and] syphilis was close to elimination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat progress has since unraveled,\u201d Bolan wrote.\n\nCDC officials say one factor contributing to the ballooning STD rates is a lack of access to preventative healthcare services. Therefore, curbing the spread of STDs requires federal, state, and local programs to expand access and promote \u201csexual, reproductive, maternal, and infant health,\u201d according to the report.\n\nYet a recently implemented federal family-planning policy is doing just the opposite, experts say. The Trump administration\u2019s revised Title X rule has not only forced hundreds of clinics that provide comprehensive reproductive healthcare to forego federal funding\u2014pushing at least two of them to shutter so far\u2014but it\u2019s also allowed that money to go to organizations that are openly opposed to evidence-based methods of preventing STIs and unintended pregnancy, namely condoms and birth control.\n\nReproductive health advocates say the combination of these two phenomena could make STI rates worse.\n\n\u201cScaling back services really affects the ability of people to know their [STI] status and receive treatment,\u201d said Usha Ranji, associate director for women\u2019s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cSTIs are also disproportionate among young people and in some cases they\u2019re also higher among low-income populations: Those are the people who use Title X programs, and whom the program serves.\u201d\n\nUntil Planned Parenthood was forced to leave the federal family-planning program, the organization served roughly 40 percent of the four million patients in the U.S. who received care through Title X\u2014that\u2019s 1.6 million patients.\n\n\"STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis often don\u2019t have symptoms, which is why it\u2019s so critical that people get tested and know their status, so that they can seek treatment and stay healthy,\u201d Courtney Benedict, associate director of medical standards implementation at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. \u201cYet the Trump administration is doubling down on its agenda to attack health care providers like Planned Parenthood\u2014making STI testing and treatment increasingly out of reach.\"\n\nObria Medical Clinics, a chain of Christian health centers, is one of the groups that has received government funding\u2014in the amount of $1.7 million, and as much as $5.1 million over three years\u2014through the new Title X policy. The organization has said it will comply with the CDC guidelines for STD prevention; however, Obria refuses to provide or even promote the use of condoms, bucking CDC recommendations. Instead, Obria\u2019s staff advocates for abstinence as the sole form of STD prevention.\n\n\u201cBy reducing sexual risk, you would have less women getting sick with STDs and [cervical] cancer and pregnancies,\u201d Obria CEO Kathleen Bravo said in a 2018 statement. \u201cIn other words, teach them to not even go down that path.\u201d\n\nObria did not respond to VICE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDebra Hauser, the president of Advocates for Youth, an organization dedicated to promoting sexual health among young people, said Obria\u2019s abstinence-only approach has long been discredited.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades that the best way to prepare young people to protect their health is to provide honest, complete sex education that gives them the tools they need to prevent unintended pregnancy and STDs,\u201d Hauser said.\n\nIn addition to denying young people the resources they need to have safe sex, groups like Obria are also heaping shame onto the very idea of sex, Hauser said, which can discourage them from seeking out help and education elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s propagating stigma and misinformation while doing nothing to help prevent STDs,\u201d Hauser continued. \u201cIf we want young people to protect themselves from STDs, we have a responsibility to give them the information and skills they need, as well as providing reproductive and sexual healthcare services and making sure condoms are available.\u201d\n\nWhereas Title X once helped establish a standard of care among family planning providers, experts say that has become more lax under the new rule, allowing groups room to promote their own agendas.\n\nThe CDC and the Office of Population Affairs\u2019 official recommendations for providing Quality Family Planning (QFP) services\u2014which encourage healthcare providers to offer a range of STD services and birth control methods\u2014are no longer incorporated in the new Title X policy.\n\n\u201cThe new final regulations define family planning as including abstinence, natural family methods, and effective contraceptive methods, but exclude abortion services,\u201d reads a Kaiser Family Foundation report following the policy change. \u201cThe regulations do not incorporate any of the other elements of CDC and OPA recommendations.\u201d\n\nBrittni Frederiksen, one of the authors of the KFF report and a senior policy analyst at the foundation, argues that this is an overlooked consequence of the new Title X rules: It\u2019s not just that the Trump administration\u2019s new guidelines reduce access to care; the guidelines also diminish the quality of care.\n\n\u201cThese recommendations became the gold standard,\u201d Frederiksen said. \u201cWhen you no longer have the standards established by Title X, the quality of services could differ based on what clinic you go to.\u201d\n\nAnd, in some places, that could mean patients won't even receive condoms.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Marie Solis on Twitter.", "description": "Religiously affiliated groups are now receiving millions in federal funds\u2014but doing little to prevent STIs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9f86a875715e000ae43b4d/lede/1570744411638-bowl-of-condoms-at-reproductive-healthcare-clinic.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8425xh;0xw,0.098xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
