This week, the Upside has left behind BoJo\u2019s baffling Brexit and holed up in Paris, where we have been attending the grandly named Convergences World Forum 2019.\n\nYou have to admire the aim: zero exclusion, zero carbon, zero poverty. The mood was uber-positive. \u201cYou are the indispensable vector for transmitting inspiration,\u201d conference lead Thibault Larose told an evening session (though my translation might be a bit literal; I\u2019ve been called many things, but never a vector).\n\nThere was no shortage of upbeat news (though no one could tell me how you say \u201cthe Upside\u201d in French). A joint project by France Inter and Konbini on combating single-use plastics, a sneak preview of an imminent enviro movement called On est pr\u00eat and a discussion about whether soap operas can encourage activism among parts of the public that the mainstream media doesn\u2019t reach.\n\nWe were asked about the origins of the Upside, the challenges of the work, and even about our growing newsletter following (that\u2019s you \u2013 we were very complimentary).\n\nCircul'R (@CirculR) \u00ab Sharing solutions can change the world \u00bb says @markriceoxley69 from @guardian\n\nInspiring conference with @Sparknews #solution pic.twitter.com/Cs8QHgLCWL\n\nWe weren\u2019t asked about our greatest hits this week, but if we had been, we would have said:\n\n1. The Irish village matchmaking asylum seekers with locals. Two-minute read.\n\n2. The innovators trying to take the carbon out of air travel. Three-minute read.\n\n3. Are mental-health first aiders the answer to workplace distress? Three-minute read.\n\nLucky numbers\n\nHIV diagnosis in England fell to its lowest level for almost two decades. Meanwhile, organ donation among BAME communities rose to the highest level ever.\n\nWhat we liked\n\nBack on the apparently popular theme of being nice to other human beings, we salute Unesco\u2019s attempt to champion some of the world\u2019s kindest people. Some inspiring examples here.\n\nAnd also here, courtesy of the lesser-known East Idaho News, which reports on a girl who made $400 from a lemonade and cookie stall in her front yard \u2013 and GAVE ALL THE MONEY AWAY to a children\u2019s hospital. With video goodness.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just about being kind to other people. One woman in the Bahamas sheltered 100 stray dogs from the onslaught of Hurricane Dorian, according to CNN.\n\nAnd finally, another piece in praise of slow, serious journalism, as opposed to shrill, rapid digital hysteria \u2026\n\nWhat we heard\n\nKarsten Hein writes from Berlin:\n\nWe are a group of blind and sighted people centred around our photo studio for blind photographers in Berlin. We started our projects on blindness and visual art in 2012. At the beginning we learnt how to overcome a handicap, visual impairment, with the help of one of the eminent human abilities, cooperation. The blind photographers started soon to develop personal styles. Building on their growing visual imagination and the not-less-eminent human ability to turn a handicap into a benefit, they are now creating unique pictures. Next Friday they will receive the prize of the jury of Wiesbadener Fototage. Now we plan a new project. On the internet pictures are like black holes for blind people. Principally every picture on the internet should be described. Yes. Where to begin? We thought Wikipedia would be a good place and German Wikimedia agrees with that. So in 2020 we will start a joint project on picture descriptions for Wikipedia. The project will be to look for multipliers in the search for picture describers. Schools, universities etc that shall commit to have their students of art, art history, creative writing etc write a certain amount of picture descriptions per semester.\n\n\n\nAnd we received this, from Lindsay Viljoen\n\nI think human acts of kindness is important. What about covering articles like animal-rescue successes, ecology-rescue successes, festivals and events which make people feel good? They don\u2019t have to be articles in other publications, they can be from members of the public who write in. What about looking at people who volunteer and the reasons why they volunteer? I volunteer as a dog walker at our local Dogs Trust branch. Why do I do it? Because it makes me feel good. What about people who have paid train fares for people who haven\u2019t enough money to pay for a ticket, or bought food for someone, rescued a hedgehog? I think there is an overwhelming amount of good done in the world.\n\nWhere was the Upside?\n\nAt the London college teaching blind people to become architects\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Blind and visually impaired students discussing their work with blind tutor Mandy Redvers-Rowe.
