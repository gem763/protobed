Goalkeeper Mat Ryan, who had held Chelsea at bay for most of the game, was wrongfooted by a deflection off Dan Burn.\n\nMuch has been made of Lampard\u2019s use of young players in what has been described as a transitional season for the London side.\n\nBut the former long-serving Chelsea midfielder said his youngsters also needed to learn from the attitude of seasoned players such as Brazilian-born Italian Jorginho and Brazilian Willian.\n\n\u201cThe work ethic was great from Willian today,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThey set the standards and the youngsters must follow.\u201d\n\nChelsea had 17 attempts on goal in the first half alone but were unable to turn their pressure and high tempo possession into goals.\n\nMount hit the post from a free kick and Ryan made two fine close-in saves from Ross Barkley and Pedro. Willian, Marcos Alonso and Tammy Abraham also fired wide from good positions.\n\n\u201cThe home games have been frustrating so far this season,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cYou could almost feel the frustration in the first half today.\u201d\n\nLampard told the players at halftime the goal was coming.\n\n\u201cI told them don\u2019t get despondent, don\u2019t get flat. It was important to say that,\u201d he said.\n\nBrighton were forced to attack after the penalty but failed to make their few chances count. Steven Alzate had a shot deflected wide and Burn headed down a corner that bounced high and hit the crossbar in the 73rd minute.\n\nIt was also Chelsea\u2019s first clean sheet of the season.\n\n\u201cWe never looked like conceding today and that was a big plus,\u201d Lampard said.\n\nThe result lifted Chelsea, who lost at home to Liverpool last week after drawing Stamford Bridge games against Leicester City and Sheffield United, to sixth in the Premier League. Brighton are a point off the bottom three in 16th place.", "description": "Second-half goals from Jorginho with a penalty and Willian's deflected shot earned Frank Lampard's Chelsea a 2-0 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday, their first home Premier League win of the season.", "authors": ["Clare Lovell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434924884&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0JP", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
