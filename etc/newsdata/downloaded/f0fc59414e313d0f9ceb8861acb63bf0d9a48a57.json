Discussions will go on continuously at the deputy level, and the principals will have another call in the near future,\" a statement said.\n\nWashington and Beijing are working to agree on the text for a \"Phase 1\" trade agreement announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Oct. 11. Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal with China's President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.\n\nIn a separate statement posted on China's Ministry of Commerce website on Saturday morning, Beijing confirmed \"technical consultations\" on some parts of a trade agreement were basically completed.\n\nAgricultural products are a major area of discussion.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said both sides confirmed the United States will import Chinese-made cooked poultry and catfish products, while China will lift a ban on U.S. poultry.\n\nBeijing wants the United States to cancel some existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, people briefed on the Friday call told Reuters, in return for pledging to step up its purchases of U.S. commodities like soybeans.\n\nThe United States wants Beijing to commit to buying these products at a specific time and price, while Chinese buyers would like the discretion to buy based on market conditions.\n\nThe world's two largest economies are trying to calm a nearly 16-month trade war that is roiling financial markets, disrupting supply chains and slowing global economic growth.\n\n\"They want to make a deal very badly,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. \"They're going to be buying much more farm products than anybody thought possible.\"\n\nTrump agreed earlier this month to cancel an Oct. 15 increase in tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods as part of a tentative agreement on agricultural purchases, increased access to China's financial services markets, improved protections for intellectual property rights and a currency pact.\n\nWhite House advisers are hoping to cement a binding, enforceable agreement with Beijing, including a pledge not to force U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese companies to do business there.\n\n\n\n\n\nTARIFFS TAKE THE LEAD\n\nBeijing was expected to ask Washington during Friday's call to drop its plan to impose tariffs on $156 billion worth of Chinese goods, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys, on Dec. 15, two U.S.-based sources told Reuters.\n\nBeijing is also seeking removal of 15% tariffs imposed on Sept. 1 on about $125 billion of Chinese goods, one of the sources said. Trump imposed the tariffs in August after a failed round of talks. \"The Chinese want to get back to tariffs on just the original $250 billion in goods,\" the source said.\n\nU.S. farmers have been struggling since the trade war started.\n\nIn the decade before Trump took office, China\u2019s purchases of U.S. agriculture and related products tripled, reaching $25.2 billion in 2016. But they dropped to $13.2 billion in 2018, after the U.S. put tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.
