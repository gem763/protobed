Can I just pray, really fast? Is it OK with everybody?\u201d\n\nThen Rhett bowed his head.\n\nChris Young presented Brown with his CMT Artists of the Year trophy, and Brown broke down in tears.\n\n\u201cI want to dedicate this to my drummer Kenny (Dixon),\u201d Brown said, his voice shaking. The pair had played together since before Brown\u2019s fame, and the \u201cHeaven\u201d singer said Dixon always believed in him.\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t think we would make it,\u201d Brown continued, then dropped his head into hands. \u201cHe was with me the whole time. He was so supportive of me. The band misses you. I love country music. God bless you guys. You all stay safe.\u201d\n\nChris Young hugs honoree Kane Brown at the 2019 CMT Artists of the Year in Nashville Wednesday.

Members of the audience dabbed at their eyes, and Young received a standing ovation.\n\nWhile Brown\u2019s heartbreak rippled through the evening, the program was mainly a celebration of 2019\u2019s high points in country music.\n\nCMT Artists of the Year marked its 10th anniversary Wednesday night by paying homage to the genre\u2019s most successful artists, tipping its hat to country heroes and spotlighting its brightest up-and-comers.\n\nHonorees included Brown; Rhett; Dan + Shay; Luke Combs; and Carrie Underwood. Also honored were Reba McEntire, who was given the Artist of a Lifetime Award, and Ashley McBryde, who received the Breakout Artist of the Year award.\n\nDan + Shay are honored as 2019 CMT Artists of the Year at the Schermerhorn Symphony Center Wednesday in Nashville.

He brought the audience to its feet with his soaring, sustained high note at the end of the song.\n\n\u201c\u2018Tequila\u2019 comes out and it\u2019s like a monster,\u201d Brown said in a video reel.\n\n\u201cThose guys have been busting it for so long,\u201d Rhett said. \u201cThey are the epitome of hard work.\u201d\n\nMooney\u2019s voice cracked with emotion when he and duo partner Dan Smyers accepted the crystalline trophy. Smyers took the chance to reflect on the full-circle moment. CMA presented the duo with its first award in summer 2018.\n\nChrissy Metz sings Luke Combs' song \"Even Though I'm Leaving\" as Combs is honored as a 2019 CMT Artist of the Year Wednesday in Nashville.

The duo has won a Grammy and trophies from the Academy of Country Music. They also have multiple nominations going into the Country Music Association Awards next month.\n\n\u201cCMT, thank you guys for believing in us and for changing our world in a bigger way than you know.\u201d\n\nCombs wasn\u2019t present to accept his trophy because he was on tour, but actress-turned-singer Chrissy Metz performed his new song \u201cEven Though I\u2019m Leaving.\u201d Underwood was also absent due to a tour. CMT live-streamed a mash-up of \u201cTwo Black Cadillacs\u201d and \u201cBlown Away\u201d before Maddie & Tae presented Underwood with her trophy onstage in Ohio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so honored to be in such cool company,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cThanks to the crowd, the fans for supporting all of us. The fans at home and the ones here tonight \u2014 you guys are the reason we get to do what we do.\u201d\n\nAshley McBryde, Breakout Artist of the Year honoree, performs at the 2019 CMT Artists of the Year at the Schermerhorn Symphony Center Wednesday in Nashville.

Dixon was killed Sunday in a car accident.

You\u2019re special. That took guts. It better be aired. It better make the cut. That\u2019s what we need in our life, is a little more God. We\u2019ve got to give this world back to God. I love this business, and I love country music. I love you all.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/16/cmt-artists-year-2019-kane-brown-thomas-rhett-memorable-moments/4005794002/", "description": "CMT Artists of the Year emotionally honored country music's best and brightest in Nashville on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Cindy Watts", "Published P.M.
