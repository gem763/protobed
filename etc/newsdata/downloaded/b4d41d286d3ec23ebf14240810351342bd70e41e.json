And on Monday evening, after days of high-level meetings at the United Nations in New York, he seemed at ease as he welcomed American movie star Tom Cruise to Kiev.\n\nIn a statement, the presidential office said Cruise visited Ukraine at Zelensky\u2019s invitation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good-looking ... like in a movie,\u201d Zelensky, a professional comedian, told Cruise, as the room burst into laughter.\n\n\u201cIt pays the rent,\u201d Cruise joked back.\n\nZelensky\u2019s office released clips of their exchange, in which Cruise can be heard saying, \u201cWe\u2019re looking, we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re very excited about it \u2026 very excited,\u201d and later mentioning that he took note of Ukraine\u2019s cobblestone streets.\n\nLittle context for their comments is available in the released clips, but Zelensky can also be heard referencing the Minsk process, an agreement that was intended to bring about a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting with Ukrainian troops since 2014.\n\nThe clips don\u2019t include any mention of Zelensky\u2019s role in the ongoing political crisis in Washington. Last week, the White House released a rough transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky, in which Trump asks the Ukrainian leader for a \u201cfavor\u201d: to help with an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s top political rivals.\n\nBut at one point in his meeting with Cruise, Zelensky seems to mention how exhausted he is.\n\n\u201cI get up and I\u2019m tired,\u201d Zelensky tells Cruise with a laugh.\n\nRead more:\n\nHis call with Trump has Washington in turmoil.
