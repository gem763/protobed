We will have to live with those consequences. As a league, we\u2019re not willing to compromise those values.\u201d\n\nThe full cost might not be known for months, with the NBA having made lucrative deals to a nation of 1.4 billion that loves basketball. But the lawmakers demanded values win over profits.\n\n\u201cEquivocating when profits are at stake is a betrayal of fundamental American values,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cThat you have more potential fans in China than in Hong Kong is no excuse for bending over backwards to express \u2018sensitivity\u2019 only to one side.\u201d\n\nLawmakers urged Silver to take four steps to harden the NBA\u2019s stance against China\u2019s retaliatory moves, most notably shutting down NBA activities in China, where two pre-season exhibition games were slated to be played.\n\n\u201cThe NBA should have anticipated the challenges of doing business in a country run by a repressive single party government, including by being prepared to stand in strong defense of the freedom of expression of its employees, players, and affiliates across the globe,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThey also pushed for an end to punishments to the Rockets, saying the NBA must be united against \u201cfuture efforts by Chinese government-controlled entities to single out individual teams, players, or associates for boycotts or selective treatment.\u201d\n\nThat would also include NBA stars with major sponsor deals in China, including LeBron James, James Harden and now-retired Kobe Bryant.\n\nLawmakers want Silver to \u201cre-evaluate\u201d having an NBA Academy in Xinjiang, \u201cwhere up to a million Chinese citizens are held in concentration camps as part of a massive government-run campaign of ethno-religious repression.\u201d About 240 teens are housed in the education and fitness centers.\n\n\u2013 Lawmakers fear self-censorship \u2013\n\nThe threat of capitulating on free speech issues to Chinese Communist Party censorship by the NBA and other businesses was a major emphasis for lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe would hope to see Americans standing up and speaking out in defense of the rights of the people of Hong Kong,\u201d the letter said, saying pressure on Morey to back away from his tweet \u201csold out an American citizen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned that individuals associated with the league may now engage in self-censorship that is inconsistent with American and the league\u2019s stated values.\n\n\u201cThis is an outcome that Americans reject, and one that you should reject \u2014 especially given that the NBA represents a unique brand for which there is no competition inside or outside China.\u201d\n\nA hard split could leave basketball-hungry fans in China struggling for banished NBA news, much like baseball fans in Communist Cuba struggled for news on US major league teams.\n\nLawmakers asked Silver to support the rights for all NBA players, staff, partners and fans to express their opinions no matter the economic repercussions and stress that while Chinese law will be respected in China, American laws and principles will govern global NBA operations.\n\nThey also want Silver to clarify in NBA documents that \u201cpublic commentary on international human rights repression \u2014 including in Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang \u2013falls within expected standards of public behavior and expression.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 A bipartisan set of US lawmakers urged the NBA on Wednesday to suspend all activities in China until Chinese firms and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/44f837_bipartisan-group-us-lawmakers-on-wednesday-urged-nba-commissioner-adam-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
