Some individuals refused to go back into the scene,\u201d Cwynar claimed during his testimony.\n\nThe now-defunct medical research cadaver company Biological Resource Center (BRC), formerly based in Arizona, is accused of misleading customers who donated their loved ones\u2019 remains for medical and scientific research, only for BRC to sell the cadavers to third parties, including the US military.\n\nCompanies like BRC provide universities, medical device manufacturers, and drug companies with human cadavers to improve their testing, all while helping to cover funeral, burial and cremation costs incurred by the deceased\u2019s relatives.\n\nIn BRC\u2019s case, donor families were promised boxes containing their deceased loved ones\u2019 remains, but later discovered the bodies had been sold to a third party. BRC owner Stephen Douglas Gore pleaded guilty in October to the felony charge of mishandling donated body parts.\n\nAlso on rt.com Buckets of heads & penises, \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 corpses found in FBI raid on horror body donation center\n\nIn one tragic instance, Jim Stauffer donated his deceased 74-year-old mother\u2019s body only for it to emerge later that her remains were strapped to a chair and blown up by the US Army.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a trusting person, but in this situation \u2013 you have no idea this is going on \u2013 you trust. That trust is what they feed on,\u201d Stauffer said.\n\nDavid TeSelle, who represents the 23 plaintiffs and their families, is seeking unspecified damages. He showed a price list during the trial, which reportedly listed a torso without a head selling for $4,000.\n\nOne of BRC\u2019s lawyers, Timothy O\u2019Connor, said on Monday that the families had signed release forms consenting to the dissection of the bodies and that it was legal for the BRC and other such facilities to make a profit.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
