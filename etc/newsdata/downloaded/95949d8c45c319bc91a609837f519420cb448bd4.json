While it shouldn't prevent the Fed from agreeing to cut rates by another quarter point on Oct. 30, it doesn't provide a firm pretext for significant or sustained U.S. dollar depreciation.\"\n\nThe deal represents the biggest step between the United States and China in a 15-month trade dispute. Friday's announcement did not include many details and Trump said it could take up to five weeks to get a pact written. He acknowledged the agreement could fall apart during that period, though he expressed confidence that it would not.", "description": "The dollar held near a 2.5-month high against the yen on Monday after Washington and Beijing announced progress towards a trade deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104878830-GettyImages-860933720.jpg?v=1571015940", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
