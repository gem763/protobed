According to a government whistleblower, Trump threatened to withhold almost $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky agreed to investigate corruption charges against former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump hits Fox News's Chris Wallace over Ukraine coverage Schiff: Whistleblower testimony might not be necessary Trump warns Democrats will lose House seats over impeachment MORE and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe timing of Hill\u2019s departure suggests she might have few insights into the question of whether there was any quid pro quo transmitted on that July 25 phone call. But she had worked closely with Yovanovitch, and was expected to convey concerns about the abrupt removal of the Ukrainian ambassador, which both the whistleblower \u2014 and later Yovanovitch herself \u2014 said was politically motivated.\n\nEmerging from the long-drawn deposition, Democrats said Hill\u2019s testimony only bolsters the allegations that Trump and those in his closest orbit had pressured foreign officials to tarnish a domestic political adversary for the purpose of boosting his reelection chances next year. They also characterized her as a highly credible civil servant \u2014 one Republicans would have difficulty discrediting.\n\n\u201cHer recall of meetings and content and who was there, with such specificity, was in some ways extraordinary,\u201d Rep.

But he has since agreed to appear after House Democrats issued a subpoena for his testimony.\n\nSondland, in text messages provided the committees by Volker, denied to another top diplomat in Ukraine that military aid was being held up as a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d The Washington Post first reported over the weekend that Sondland plans to say that his message was based on a phone call with Trump.\n\nRepublicans blasted Democrats for continuing to hold witness interviews behind closed doors instead of in public while certain aspects of each testimony is leaked to media outlets.\n\nDemocrats defended the closed-door sessions as a way to prevent witnesses from aligning their testimonies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why investigations and grand jury proceedings, for example, and I think this is analogous to a grand jury proceeding, are done out of the public view initially,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffTrump hits Fox News's Chris Wallace over Ukraine coverage Schiff: Whistleblower testimony might not be necessary A Republican Watergate veteran's perspective on a Trump impeachment MORE (D-Calif.) told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, adding that lawmakers may call some witnesses to public hearings as well.\n\n\"But we want to make sure that we meet the needs of the investigation and not give the president or his legal minions the opportunity to tailor their testimony, and in some cases fabricate their testimony, to suit their interests,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nBut Rep.
