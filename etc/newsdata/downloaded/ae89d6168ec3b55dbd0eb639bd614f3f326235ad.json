The majority of the duties will take effect Dec. 15, and China's plans to reinstate tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts will also not take place until that time.\n\nA report by Panjiva, a supply chain data company that's part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, pointed out that the products in the Sept. 1 group may have been chosen since those items saw some recovery in shipments rather than further decline. The Aug. 27 analysis pointed out that U.S. exports in the Sept. 1 group fell by 15.2% in the second quarter from a year ago, versus a drop of 20.4% for the Dec. 15 group.\n\nThe increases are part of the Ministry of Finance's Aug. 23 announcement for retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods. A portion of President Donald Trump's latest tariff increases also took effect Sunday.\n\nEssentially, all $550 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U.S. are set to be subject to duties when another round is implemented in December.", "description": "The proportion of Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods that took effect on Sunday only account for about one third of more than 5,000 product lines listed.", "authors": ["Evelyn Cheng"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106090351-1566412094842gettyimages-1035842668.jpeg?v=1566412148"}
