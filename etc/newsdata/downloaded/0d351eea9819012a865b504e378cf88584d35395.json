According to E! News, a source close to Cyrus said that the monthlong relationship was starting to get serious, but the singer was not down with that. Alexa, please play \u201cCan\u2019t Be Tamed\u201d by Miley Cyrus.\n\nCyrus and Carter were rumored to have begun dating in August, shortly after their respective relationships came to an end, with Cyrus announcing her divorce from husband Liam Hemsworth and Carter splitting from her longtime boyfriend \u2014 and The Hills: New Beginnings co-star \u2014 Brody Jenner. \u201cWhen they first got together, it was just a fun casual thing, but it ended up becoming a lot and there were big emotions attached,\u201d the source told E!. \u201cIt went from zero to 60 and she wanted to put on the brakes. It was unexpected to end things so abruptly, but it had to be done. She just got out of her marriage and Miley felt like she and Kaitlynn got carried away.\u201d\n\nCyrus and Carter have not publicly commented on the breakup, but a source told People that they are still on good terms. \u201cThey\u2019ve been friends forever and were there for each other when they were both getting separated, but they\u2019re just not in a romantic relationship anymore,\u201d the source said. If you\u2019d like some proof of their continuing friendship, Carter recently commented on photo in Cyrus\u2019s Instagram with a very supportive, \u201cGET IT!!!!!\u201d\n\nSo, that\u2019s a good sign, unless you\u2019d like to analyze Cyrus\u2019s latest Insta caption, which reads, \u201cI hate talkin shit but uhhhhh\u201d *sips tea* ( j/k I love it).\u201d Miley, what does it mean? Never mind, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing and these two women will be fine!!! And, who knows, maybe Cyrus will come out with another new breakup song.\n\nStay in touch.
