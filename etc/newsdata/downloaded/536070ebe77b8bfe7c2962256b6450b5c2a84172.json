I had an official call with the chief executive Matt Hammerstein to probe further and get him to change his decision.\n\nHere's what our readers think I will now have to drive to a branch for cash or change bank. I have been a customer for just over 50 years. Think about your loyal customers big and small. T. F., via email I am appalled. This measure will mainly affect people who live in isolated communities or, like myself, with mobility problems. J. L., via email I will now have to drive 24 miles for a round trip to my local bank. Barclays seem to have no regard for their customers, only for profit. S. C., Stamford We need cash for gardeners, hairdressers, window cleaners, to pay friends for shopping and to give grandchildren treats. J. O., near Cambridge I am very disappointed in Barclays, who I have banked with for 50 years. This is shabby business for all their customers. J. S., Norfolk I am 78 and 4ft 10in and feel very vulnerable using outside cash machines. The post office is a life saver. What are Barclays playing at? P. B., Cornwall\n\n\u2018This is something I\u2019ve been raising with all the banks over a period of time. I expect them to support the Post Office and postmasters to deliver a vital service.\n\nThe secretary of state is as disappointed as I am with the decision.

It is trying to pretend that it is not going to affect people, when clearly it is.\n\nThe bank\u2019s top bosses face being hauled in front of a public inquiry after concerns were raised about the impact the decision would have on benefits claimants. Last year, Barclays customers made 15 million cash withdrawals through the Post Office network [File photo]\n\n\u2018Banks shouldn\u2019t just continuously cut the amount of service they offer in pursuit of short-term profits. They\u2019re creating unnecessary inconvenience, cost and distress.\u2019\n\nIt is thought the decision will save Barclays, which makes annual profits of \u00a33.5billion, just \u00a37million a year.\n\nIn the last four years, more than 3,300 high street bank and building society branches have closed their doors. At least 481 were owned by Barclays, Which? magazine found.\n\nThe consumer group has called on the Government to legislate to protect cash for elderly and vulnerable communities, after a report found eight million people would struggle in a cashless society.\n\nBarclays\u2019 decision has also left a cloud over the 11,500-strong Post Office network in case other banks follow suit.\n\nThe intervention at the highest level of government comes after the Mail highlighted how thousands of Barclays customers faced being left without access to cash.
