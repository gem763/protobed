(AP) - The Chicago Bears took a big step toward the NFC North championship when they beat Minnesota at Soldier Field last season.\n\nIf the Vikings return the favor on Sunday, the climb toward a second straight division title would be a steep one.\n\n\u201cThis is a division game, right?\u201d Bears coach Matt Nagy said. \u201cAt home against a pretty good defense and an offense right now that\u2019s like tops in the league in running the football. \u2026 You better come ready to buckle-your-chinstrap type deal. So the game is big. It\u2019s a division, it\u2019s at home. All these division games, we\u2019re 0-1 right now at home versus a division opponent.\u201d\n\nThe Bears (2-1) opened the NFL\u2019s 100th season with a 10-3 loss at Soldier Field to Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. And they\u2019ll try to avoid an 0-2 start at home with another loss to a division rival when they host the Vikings (2-1).\n\nChicago has won two in a row on the road since dropping the opener, beating Denver on a last-second field goal by Eddy Pineiro and dominating Washington 31-15 on Monday night. But after getting a breather against the Redskins, the Bears figure to face a more difficult challenge.\n\nThe Vikings have NFL rushing leader Dalvin Cook and a defense that can give quarterbacks more than a few headaches. Then again, Minnesota will have to contend with Khalil Mack and Co.\n\nThey had no luck last year, getting swept by Chicago for the first time since 2011.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to make plays, we\u2019re going to make plays,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see if we can keep that same energy the whole game, staying on schedule, sticking with the run. Whatever the play call is, just sticking with it if it don\u2019t get what we want. Just stay on schedule, stick with it. It\u2019s going to be a game of emotions.\u201d\n\nLOOKING BACK\n\nThe Bears took a big step toward securing their first division championship since 2010 with a 25-20 victory at home last season, and they kept the Vikings out of the playoffs by beating them on the road to wrap up the regular season.\n\nKirk Cousins had two of his three lowest passer ratings against Chicago and got sacked six times.\n\nHEATING UP\n\nBears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky delivered his best performance of the season after a sluggish start against winless Washington on Monday night - but not before he got reamed by his coach.\n\nESPN caught Nagy yelling at Trubisky on the sideline during a timeout on third down at the Washington 22 with 8:23 left in the second quarter. Three plays later, Trubisky and Taylor Gabriel connected for the first of three touchdowns in a span of just over six minutes.\n\n\u201cI have a little bit of a heated side to me at times, and I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but Mitch does, too,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cThat\u2019s just today\u2019s world.\u201d\n\nA coach yelling at a player generally wouldn\u2019t attract much attention. But Nagy has rarely - if ever - criticized his quarterback, at least in public.\n\nEither way, Trubisky came through after struggling against Green Bay and Denver. The No. 2 overall draft pick in 2017, he was 25 of 31 passes for 231 yards and threw his first three touchdowns of the season. And he had no problem with Nagy getting on him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with showing a little emotion, it\u2019s part of the game,\u201d Trubisky said.\n\nRUNNING MAN\n\nOne way to keep Cousins protected will be to help Cook get going on the ground again. Cook has been so productive that Minnesota has only attempted an average of 21 passes per game, by far the lowest average of any team in the league.\n\nSOLDIERING ON\n\nVikings fans will often wince thinking about watching their team play in Illinois, with a 3-15 record on the road against the Bears since 2000, but as coach Mike Zimmer was quick to remind reporters this week, two of those wins have come in the past four visits (2015 and 2017).\n\nSo is Soldier Field a daunting place to play?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what everybody told me when I got here. Then we won some games. I guess if you turn the ball over and you create penalties and you do dumb things, it\u2019s a pretty hard place to play,\u201d Zimmer said, before noting the Bears have lost their past two home games, to Philadelphia in the playoffs last season and to Green Bay in the opener this year.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Dave Campbell contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Chicago Bears took a big step toward the NFC North championship when they beat Minnesota at Soldier Field last season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Seligman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/bears_redskins_football_63358_c0-189-4524-2826_s1770x1032.jpg?8d5032c75047bd8042066f9a5e04b092ad8ffe91", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
