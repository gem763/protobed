It\u2019s more like a documentary album. And it\u2019s based on a real character called Arthur, who was my \u00adbrother-in-law [Arthur Anning], who came out of the war disillusioned \u2014 voted Churchill out. There are lots of parallels in \u2018Arthur\u2019 to what\u2019s happening in the world.\u201d\n\nThe expanded and remastered \u201cArthur\u201d includes alternative mixes, unreleased songs and an abandoned solo album from younger brother and perpetually underappreciated guitarist Dave Davies. The record captured the Kinks at their artistic peak but also an odd time for a band that emerged with the Who and the Rolling Stones. In the late \u201960s, if you lived in the United States and wanted to see the Davies brothers play a gig, your chances were better in Beirut than Boston. The group was banned from touring the States from 1965 to 1969 for reported bad behavior on a previous tour.\n\nRay Davies today says that ban contributed to the creative surge that started with 1966\u2019s \u201cFace to Face.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI buried myself in English culture,\u201d says Davies, 75. \u201cAnd I wrote songs like \u2018Waterloo Sunset,\u2019 \u2018Sunny Afternoon,\u2019 \u2018Dedicated Follower of Fashion\u2019 rather than trying to write \u2018Stairway to Heaven.\u2019 I think the band suffered because we couldn\u2019t tour America at that time. We would have toured with Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, the peak of the great second invasion. We missed that. But I immersed myself in writing English folkish material.\u201d\n\nYou practically had to wipe the clotted cream off your needle during the four-album run that concluded with 1969\u2019s \u201cArthur.\u201d Other groups wrote about girl problems or which pill made you larger. Davies wrote about social class and social climbing, crumbling ceilings and teen envy. All of it was delivered with a punkish wink by musicians who sounded as if they had one foot in the studio, the other in the pub.\n\n\u201cArthur\u201d would seem the unlikeliest theme for compelling rock-and-roll. Yet it works. It\u2019s a record that features a snaky blues with quotes from Winston Churchill. It also finds Davies, seemingly lost in his characters, slipping into different voices and deliveries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think Ray always wanted to be an actor,\u201d says bassist John Dalton. \u201cIn his songs, he\u2019s playing a part.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I sing in character a lot,\u201d says Davies. \u201c \u2018Yes sir, no sir,\u2019 I\u2019m trying to sound like a subservient soldier talking to an officer. It must be confusing for people, but it\u2019s the way I get through.\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur\u201d was originally meant for actors; Davies planned it as a television program. It became a record when the project fell through.\n\nAnning\u2019s decision to emigrate to Australia with his wife, Rosie, the oldest of eight Davies siblings, \u201cwas a big wrench,\u201d says Dave Davies, 72.\n\nThrough Anning, Ray Davies darts through the first half of Britain\u2019s 20th century. The reign of Victoria and the social classes, the horrific losses of World War I, the Churchillian comeback and the frustrating postwar struggles for a generation that had sacrificed everything yet often seemed to be running in place. Seen through the eyes of a cagey, sarcastic, 24-year-old art school kid turned reluctant rock star, it could be hard to tell whether Davies was attacking the man sitting by the fire in his \u201cShangri-La\u201d or admiring the satisfaction he took from the simplest, \u00admiddle-class pleasures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cArthur was a soulful guy,\u201d says Davies. \u201cObviously another generation. But the album in some ways is critical of his generation but also supportive and understanding. At the end of \u2018Arthur,\u2019 the song, I sing, \u2018We\u2019d like to help you and understand you\u2019 and \u2018Somebody loves you, don\u2019t you know it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBy 1969, the Kinks seemed to be operating in an alternative rock universe. They missed out on the Age of Aquarius, though without regret, Dave Davies says.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t there. We were banned,\u201d he says. \u201cWe missed out on Woodstock, but we moved merrily along on our own.\u201d\n\nIn typical Kinksian fashion, the original \u201cArthur\u201d was hailed by critics but didn\u2019t even crack Billboard\u2019s Top 100.The record company\u2019s publicity team did, however, deliver the \u201cGod Save the Kinks\u201d slogan. And after Ray Davies reportedly apologized to the musicians union for the band\u2019s behavior during its 1965 U.S. tour, the Kinks were able to play the States. In 1970, a new song, \u201cLola,\u201d would even return them to the Top 10.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the Kinks who arrived at New York\u2019s Fillmore East in the fall of 1969 were far from the arena stars they would become in the late 1970s. They had lost bassist Pete Quaife, who had quit to form his own band, Mapleoak, and added Dalton, who had spent a chunk of the \u201960s at his day job delivering coal. Dalton\u2019s driving style gave a boost to the band\u2019s sound, particularly on songs like album opener \u201cVictoria.\u201d\n\n\u201cPete played fancier than me,\u201d says Dalton. \u201cI was more basic. I was brought up with Elvis, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Chuck Berry.\u201d\n\nDalton seemed unfazed by the warring within the band. The famously dysfunctional Davies brothers were just one issue. Drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies were known to fight onstage and at some point in 1969, Avory now says he actually tried to quit. The brothers, he says, didn\u2019t seem to acknowledge his written resignation. And he forgot about the notion when they began touring the States again.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was volatile in those days, and you couldn\u2019t help but get involved with it all,\u201d says Avory. \u201cThere were times when I felt I just wanted to get out of it. If you haven\u2019t got anywhere to go, you stay where you are, I suppose.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us to the never-ending question of a reunion. The Kinks haven\u2019t played live since 1996 or released a studio album since 1993\u2019s \u201cPhobia.\u201d Ray Davies remains cagey about the prospects of getting the band back together. He seems to float the idea regularly, sparking yet another round of reunion headlines.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear, from interviews with Dave Davies and Avory earlier this month, is that there has been no in-studio reunion of the three remaining original Kinks \u2014 Quaife died in 2010. Avory says that Ray Davies occasionally calls him in to play alongside an already recorded backing track. Dave Davies talks of unfinished tracks in the Kinks archives that he and his brother want to finish. There is some new material they\u2019ve been batting around. Nothing is defined.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been all talking almost since they packed it in 23 years ago,\u201d says Avory, with a laugh. \u201cIf it carries on any longer, we\u2019ll have to have a resurrection rather than a reunion.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Ray and Dave Davies talk about \u201cArthur,\u201d their just-reissued 1969 album, which feels newly relevant in the era of Brexit.", "authors": ["Geoff Edgers", "Reporter Covering Movies", "Museums", "Comedy", "Music", "Pop Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QEmguDnr3PDcKbhzvosa16J9xHg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZNZCU6HVUII6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
