But also good. When I was in high school, if a girl didn\u2019t like me, the first thing she\u2019d say was, \u201cYou think you\u2019re so cool because of your parents.\u201d That carries into later life, like, \u201cOh, you just got this part because your parents are this and that,\u201d\u2019 she added.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s important to acknowledge that I got in the door easier because of them. Some kids work their whole lives and they can\u2019t even get an agent to call them back. That part was handed to me. People are always going to think that maybe you are who you are because of your family. So it\u2019s my responsibility to work harder.\u2019", "description": "The beauty - who stars in Big Little Lies - was announced as the new bad girl of Gotham by Variety on Monday.
