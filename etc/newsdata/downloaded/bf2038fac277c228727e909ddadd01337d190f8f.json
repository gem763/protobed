Across the country, the party showed its political leadership.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the loss of seats in Moscow was due to the protest vote, Mr Peskov said: \"The result shows the opposite - that all the theories of political pundits about a protest vote were not confirmed.\"", "description": "United Russia is set to lose many seats, but will retain a majority in the city parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A0CE/production/_108666114_d5f8d807-0213-46f0-8ece-62ca066564ff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
