To avoid defeat against Club Brugge on Tuesday, the 13-time European champions had to fight back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2.\n\nTottenham slumped to the biggest margin of defeat by a team from England playing at home in any European competition.\n\nAdding insult for Tottenham was the sight of Serge Gnabry, a former player at fierce rival Arsenal, scoring four of the goals for Bayern with clinical finishing. All of them came in a wild second half in the Group B game featuring six goals in total.\n\n\u201cEvery single touch went in,\u201d Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said.\n\nWhile it was a statement win for Bayern, which hasn\u2019t been widely regarded as one of the Champions League favorites amid something of a transitional season for the German club, the manner of the defeat exacerbates the concerns surrounding Tottenham and Pochettino.\n\nTottenham has been far from its best in the Premier League, squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Olympiakos in its opening Champions League game, and was eliminated from the English League Cup by fourth-tier Colchester last week. Pochettino is in his sixth year as manager, leading to fears that Tottenham has gone as far as it can under the Argentine, who has spoken publicly about tensions in the squad since the loss to Liverpool in last season\u2019s Champions League final.\n\n\u201cWe are very disappointed and very upset,\u201d Pochettino said, \u201cbut we have to stay together.\u201d\n\nMADRID COMEBACK\n\nBarely 40 minutes had elapsed, Real Madrid was losing 2-0 at home to one of the Champions League\u2019s supposedly weaker teams, and Club Brugge scorer Emmanuel Bonaventure was taunting fans inside the Santiago Bernabeu by imitating the famous \u201cSi!\u201d goal celebration of Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nMadrid coach Zinedine Zidane would soon be substituting his goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, at halftime.\n\nSuccess in European soccer\u2019s biggest club competition has come so easy for Zidane as Madrid coach - he won the Champions League an unprecedented three straight seasons in his first spell at the Spanish club - but he\u2019s not finding it so easy early in his second stint in charge.\n\nMadrid\u2019s players roused themselves and recovered to draw 2-2 against their visitors from Belgium, thanks to headers by Sergio Ramos and Casemiro. But qualification for the last 16 is far from the certainty it seemed when the group-stage draw was made.\n\nHaving opened the group by being outplayed in a 3-0 loss at Paris Saint-Germain, Madrid - like Tottenham - is in last place on one point.\n\nThe Spanish team hasn\u2019t failed to advance past the group stage since the 1989-90 season, which was so long ago the competition was called the European Cup. A loss away to Galatasaray in the third round of games would make things extremely tough for the record 13-time European champions.\n\nPSG didn\u2019t find its trip to Turkey straightforward on Tuesday, only winning 1-0 win thanks to Mauro Icardi\u2019s first goal for the French club.\n\nRONALDO SCORES AGAIN\n\nIt\u2019s now a record-extending 127 goals for Cristiano Ronaldo in the Champions League.\n\nThe Portugal forward scored the third goal in Juventus\u2019 3-0 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen, adding to strikes by Gonzalo Higuain and Federico Bernardeschi.\n\nJuventus opened Group D with a 2-2 draw against Atletico Madrid, which also responded with a win - 2-0 at Lokomotiv Moscow through goals by Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix and Thomas Partey.\n\nSTERLING SPARKS CITY\n\nA lively substitute\u2019s appearance by Raheem Sterling sparked Manchester City to a 2-0 win over Dinamo Zagreb and a second straight win to open Group C.\n\nCity\u2019s finishing had been wasteful at Etihad Stadium before Sterling came on as a 56th-minute sub and met a cross from Riyad Mahrez with a side-footed finish from close range 10 minutes later.\n\nPhil Foden, also on as a substitute but only in the 90th minute, made the points safe by running onto Sterling\u2019s pass on a counterattack and shooting low into the corner with virtually the last touch of the game.\n\nThe English champions are well on their way to qualification, having started with a 3-0 win at Shakhtar Donetsk two weeks ago.\n\nIn its second match, Shakhtar scored with practically the last kick before the final whistle to beat Atalanta 2-1 as the Italian side\u2019s first home game in the Champions League ended in disappointment.\n\nManor Solomon scored sin the fifth minute of stoppage time after Junior Moraes canceled out Duvan Zapata\u2019s opener for Atalanta in the first half.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Champions League finalist for the first time just four months ago, Tottenham is making history again in Europe's top club competition this season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/britain_soccer_champions_league_21768_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
