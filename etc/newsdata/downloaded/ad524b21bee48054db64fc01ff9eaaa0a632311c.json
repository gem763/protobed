The protesters, chased by baton-wielding police, chanted the slogans of the Arab Spring uprisings as they stomped on banners bearing Sisi\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very, very brave to go into the streets because it\u2019s extremely dangerous,\u201d said one Cairo-based activist. \u201cThis is extremely significant. These numbers, no matter how small, show a bigger, bolder move than other huge protests that have been safe.\u201d\n\nIt was not some high-minded call for change by democracy activists that prompted Egyptians in multiple cities to challenge Sisi\u2019s security forces in the streets en masse for the first time in several years. The spark was a series of videos alleging corruption and waste by a rough-and-tumble contractor and occasional actor named Mohamed Ali.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSpeaking from exile in Spain, he used the gritty vocabulary of a street vendor who lost all his wares to a corrupt cop to describe how Sisi and his coterie of generals bilked him of $13.3m, bankrupted his company, and continue to squander the country\u2019s resources by building themselves palaces with public money.\n\nThe aggrieved businessman named names, and massive construction projects, spelling out how Sisi and his top brass allegedly squandered money on a seven-star hotel owned by the military intelligence branch as well as personal palaces and villas for the officers, pocketing money along the way.\n\n\u201cThey shattered my dreams and pushed me to leave my country, fearing that they would harm me and my children,\u201d Ali said on his Facebook page in one in a series of videos and posts that began on 2 September and continued until he called for the protests on Friday.\n\nDespite attempting to censor the videos, they went viral \u2013 egged on no doubt by supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood driven into exile by Sisi\u2019s unprecedented crackdown on civil society. They have been plotting against Sisi from abroad since they were ousted from power in 2013 and mercilessly hunted down.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I am building a new state.\u201d\n\nSisi\u2019s style is different from the consensus-building manner of Egypt\u2019s long-time autocrat Hosni Mubarak, and it\u2019s long begun to grate on the nerves of Egyptians of all classes. Sisi came to power following a popularly-backed 2013 coup against the elected government of the Islamist Mohamed Morsi, and has been grown steadily more authoritarian over the past six years, jailing or sidelining any potential opponents, and silencing even whispers of public discontent.\n\nJust days before the protests, Mosaad Abu Fagr, an activist in Egypt\u2019s volatile Sinai Peninsula, posted a video alleging corruption in the army\u2019s fight against militants, accusing Sisi\u2019s son Mahmoud of profiting from the smuggling business to the adjacent Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cAll business that goes to Gaza is Mahmoud and his fronts,\u201d he alleged, adding that another commander had been building himself a luxury villa.\n\nThe accusations enraged Egyptians soldiering through hard times. Despite plaudits by ratings agencies and western financial analysts who hail Egypt\u2019s austerity measures and growth rates, according to Egypt\u2019s own statistics, 5 per cent of the country has fallen into poverty over the past several years. The World Bank estimates 60 per cent of Egyptians are impoverished.\n\n\u201cEveryone following Egypt over the past few years knows it\u2019s a boiling pot,\u201d says Amr Magd, Egypt researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cSisi is an authoritarian leader very different from Mubarak. Sisi has real psychological and emotional issues. It\u2019s not just about ruling the country. It\u2019s about absolute control.\u201d\n\nWestern countries have bet big on Sisi\u2019s Egypt as a force for \u201cstability\u201d in the Middle East.\n\nThe UK has approved some \u00a3141m in arms sales, including weaponry that could be used against street protests, according to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, an advocacy group. The US and France also sell Egypt weapons totalling billions, money that could be used to ameliorate the suffering of the Egyptian people.\n\nPresident Donald Trump reportedly described Sisi as his \u201cfavourite dictator,\u201d as he and other world leaders embraced the Egyptian leader at the recent G7 summit.\n\nBut that a couple of loudmouths in homemade videos can trigger so much unrest should give pause in western capitals that continue to bank on Sisi.", "description": "Simmering aspirations for democracy and economic justice underlie the small anti-government protests that broke out over the weekend against Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s autocratic regime.", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/21/12/cairo-protests.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
