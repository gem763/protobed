I've got myself a credit card with \u00a33,000 on it. I've squared the missus up, she knows, she'll be coming with me.\n\n\"'There are a couple of lads bringing their missuses so they're going to have their pamper days but that credit card is there for nothing else but your fight'.\n\n\"You can't buy that. The fella has gone out and maybe put himself into a bit of debt. But he said, 'I've been there since you won a fight at the town hall'.\n\n\"That was in 2013 and he's been to every one since, he's been on that journey.\n\n\"He's been there backing me all the way, it's been a long journey. He said, 'There's no way I'm not seeing you in Vegas, in New York, on those billboards. People around the world talking about you, I'm there, it's happening'.\n\n\"Another one of my school pals said to his missus, 'I know we've just bought a new house, I know we've just had a baby but listen, I've been to school with him. I used too see him in art class, in maths class and for him to be fighting in Vegas or New York, you don't understand, I have to be there for the full week.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"'I'm not just going for the night, I've got to be soaking up the open workouts, the press conferences, the weigh-ins. It's a once-in-a-lifetime'.\n\n\"And when he said that, f****** hell, it hit me a little bit because he won't know anyone else who he's grown up with who's going to be able to have that opportunity to fight in these big stage shows.\"\n\nWarrington fights for the 30th time tonight having won his world title against Lee Selby at Elland Road last year.\n\nBut he only shot to prominence in 2015 when he began to sell out the Leeds Arena he has now made his second home.\n\nBut after hard-fought title defences against Carl Frampton and Kid Galahad, Warrington is desperate to follow in the footsteps of his idols and box in America.\n\n\"When I started out I wanted to be British champion, I wanted to fight at the Leeds Arena,\" he said. \"I know they're not that exciting to most boxing people, a lot of fighters turn professional in this day and age with aspirations of being a unified champion, long before they've even done a four or six rounder.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"For me, growing up watching the likes of Ricky Hatton, Joe Calzaghe, you see the big nights in Madison Square Garden and Las Vegas.\n\n\"It's about making memories for not just myself but the fans as well. Those who have been with me along the journey from the leisure centres, fighting after the main events, to the arenas, to Leeds Arena, to Elland Road - it's about going and giving them an opportunity to support me in different venues.\n\n\"So people say, 'You're obsessed with going to the States,' but it's because to have the name on a billboard and see thousands of fans having a holiday together, travelling on plane journeys together, being among the hotel foyers and venue foyers and in years to come saying, 'Do you remember when we went to that fight back in 2018, 2019, 2020 to watch Josh Warrington fight?'.\n\n\"I boxed on the Paul Smith-Arthur Abraham undercard in Berlin in 2015. It was only an eight-rounder, it was only against Edwin Tellez, a seasoned journeyman now. But I've heard that many stories and that many tales - about travelling to the airport, the plane journey over, anytime I hear that it brings a smile to my face.\n\n\"Yeah I have personal goals - I want to win world titles - but I'd like to win them in someone else's backyard now.\n\n\"I want to show I can go into someone else's backyard - maybe it takes pressure off a little bit - but also to make the memories for fans who have been there.\"", "description": "Warrington defends his featherweight world title against Sofiane Takoucht in Leeds tonight", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561110.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Josh-Warrington-Sofiane-Takoucht-Weigh-In.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
