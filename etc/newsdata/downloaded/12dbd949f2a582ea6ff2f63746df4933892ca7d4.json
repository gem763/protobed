Cole, 29, is likely to command the biggest contract ever handed to a free agent pitcher, a mark held by David Price ($217 million from the Boston Red Sox in 2015).\n\nAD\n\nWould the hiring of Maddon, who replaces Brad Ausmus in Anaheim, have the desired effect on Cole\u2019s ultimate choice? His Astros teammates believe he already prefers a team in southern California \u2014 he is both a native and a resident of Orange County \u2014 but his market is expected to include, at minimum, both the Angels and Los Angeles Dodgers, plus the Yankees, San Francisco Giants and several other teams. Perhaps the Maddon hiring could push him over the top if there are multiple offers in the same range, but with Scott Boras as his agent, Cole isn\u2019t likely to grant any discounts for his hometown team.\n\nAD\n\nBack in 2015, the Cubs hired Maddon on Nov. 15, and a month later they signed free agent lefty Jon Lester to a six-year, $155 million deal \u2014 the move that more than any other signaled the end of the Cubs\u2019 rebuild and the beginning of their win-now phase. In five years in Chicago, Maddon led the Cubs to four playoff appearances, two division titles and three consecutive trips to the National League Championship Series \u2014 in addition to the historic World Series title in 2016.\n\nMaddon\u2019s task in Anaheim, however, could be even tougher. Not only are the Angels coming off their worst season (72-90) since 1999, but they are also embroiled in a messy investigation regarding the death by overdose of former pitcher Tyler Skaggs. Skaggs, 27, was found to have oxycodone and fentanyl in his system when he died at the team\u2019s hotel in July in Texas.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency is investigating Skaggs\u2019s death, and a team media relations employee has told investigators he procured drugs and abused them with Skaggs for years. At least six current or former Angels players have reportedly been interviewed as part of the investigation.\n\nAD\n\nMaddon is known for his irreverent style, outsized personality and hands-off approach in the clubhouse. His hiring by the Angels is a homecoming of sorts: he spent 31 years in the organization as a player, scout, minor-league coach and major league coach under former manager Mike Scioscia, before getting the Tampa Bay managing job in 2006. He became a managerial star with the Rays, taking the upstart franchise to the World Series in 2008 and posting six straight winning seasons there.\n\nMaddon\u2019s hiring was the first move of what will be a busy season of managerial hires. Seven other teams \u2014 the Cubs, San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, Kansas City Royals, San Diego Padres and Pittsburgh Pirates \u2014 are still looking for managers following a month of heavy turnover.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled Joe is coming back home and bringing an exciting brand of baseball to our fans,\u201d Angels General Manager Billy Eppler said in a statement. \u201cEvery stop he has made throughout his managerial career he has built a culture that is focused on winning while also allowing his players to thrive. We believe Joe will be a great asset for our club and we look forward to him leading the team to another World Series championship.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The hiring of Maddon is designed to give the franchise some needed credibility on the eve of an important offseason talent market.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/x_yijdRKMXYKI7unWxAWp8NdD4w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4JNQ5LXQFYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
