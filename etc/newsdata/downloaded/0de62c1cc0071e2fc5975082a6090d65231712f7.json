Some have also done the same to their bottom lips.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t believe most people will add this trick to their daily makeup routine, I still think this hack is unnecessary and could cause some people to feel insecure about themselves.\n\nDermatologists also told Insider that the practice can be harmful and cause irritation across the face.\n\nVisit Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nDespite being obsessed with makeup, I\u2019ve always stayed away from false lashes. Not only do I find them irritating, but the thought of applying glue near my eyeballs is horrifying.\n\nSo you can probably imagine how shocked I was to learn that Tik Tok users have started a new beauty trend that involves applying eyelash glue to their lips. The hack is meant to give the appearance of fuller pouts without needing actual lip injections.\n\nWhile dermatologists have told Insider that eyelash glue can be harmful to lips, I also worry that the trend might contribute to further unrealistic beauty standards.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look inside the trend that\u2019s taking over social media.\n\nPeople are sharing videos of themselves applying eyelash glue to their lips\n\nFrom Twitter to YouTube, you can now find videos of people \u2013 often young women \u2013 applying a dash of eyelash glue right above their mouth. They then use their fingers to press their upper lip to the adhesive, often holding it in place for multiple seconds.\n\nOnce their lip seems set in place, some people do the same to their bottom lip. They apply adhesive under their mouth, and then hold their bottom lip to the glue. The final result is a rounded mouth that resembles the after-effects of lip injections.\n\nthere\u2019s a trend on tik tok where girls put eyelash glue on their upper lip and stick their top lip to it to give them a lip injection type look and I tried it and pic.twitter.com/HYibcNgx4Y \u2014 double jointed queen (@saddumbgirl) September 7, 2019\n\nTik Tok users appear to be the first people on social media to take part in the trend\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear as to who first filmed themselves applying glue to their lips, many videos of the practice have popped up on the app Tik Tok since September.\n\nIn fact, videos posted with the hashtag #lashglue have been viewed more than 2.5 million times. Similarly, the #thelashgluechallenge tag has more than 28,000 views.\n\ncaption A screenshot of the Tik Tok app, taken on Friday. source Amanda Krause/Insider\n\nMany Tik Tok users have also shared their videos on Twitter, bringing the trend to other social-media platforms.\n\nbruh i tried that bratz lip trend on tiktok bc everyone look cute doing but but uhhh \u2026\u2026 pic.twitter.com/s1zWDfm3ka \u2014 angelene (@AngieRieta) September 7, 2019\n\nYall I did that trend where you glue your lip up\u2026 im dying ???????????? pic.twitter.com/mIHlZmd4tC \u2014 ???? Alexandra Daniels ???? (@alexdanielsxo) September 8, 2019\n\nYouTubers are also getting in on the beauty hack\n\nOn September 23, lifestyle YouTuber Tina Yong shared a video of herself trying out the trend for her ongoing series \u201cTina Tries It.\u201d\n\nAccording to the YouTuber, the trick only provides short-term results that last between a few seconds and minutes. She also said it looks very obvious when glue is applied to the upper lip, as you can see where the skin folds.\n\n\u201cBoth top and bottom feel super uncomfortable,\u201d Yong said about applying eyelash glue to her lips. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say this trend won\u2019t be sticking around for very long. But you know what? It was actually quite funny just to see myself like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you guys get bored and you wanna have a good laugh, try it at home with eyelash glue,\u201d she continued. \u201cDo not put any other type of glue on those areas \u2013 especially not super glue.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Insider, Yong said she tried the beauty hack simply to see if it would work.\n\n\u201cI love trying new beauty trends, especially ones that I see online,\u201d Yong told Insider. \u201cSo when I saw this trend on TikTok, I was curious to see if eyelash glue would actually hold my lip up.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo my surprise, it did \u2013 but only temporarily,\u201d she continued. \u201cI thought it was really funny, but I would never actually go out in public like that.\u201d\n\nStill, the trend doesn\u2019t seem to be as popular among YouTubers as it is among Tik Tok users\n\nThis might have to do with the fact that YouTube places a warning before videos about the trend.\n\nI came across the warning while trying to view a video from a YouTuber named Eileen, who currently has more than 15,000 subscribers. YouTube warned that the video \u201cmight be inappropriate for some users.\u201d Still, I was able to click one button and view the clip.\n\ncaption A screenshot of YouTube\u2019s warning to viewers. source Amanda Krause/Insider\n\nBefore Tik Tok beauty trends existed, the #KylieJennerChallenge created similar hype\n\nIn 2015, Kylie Jenner made headlines with her suddenly fuller-looking lips, which she later confirmed were created by fillers. To mimic her signature look, some people began using shot glasses as suction cups to create bigger pouts. The trend was called the #KylieJennerChallenge on social media.\n\nUnfortunately, the trend proved harmful for many. Numerous people who shared photos of their attempts on social media revealed bruising and bleeding across their lips.\n\n;ADFKNS;FCAKLNCA RT @broadwaystyIes: I did the Kylie Jenner lip thing and now I have a lip hickey I regret everything pic.twitter.com/KSGq1NmbYT \u2014 Nelson Sorry To This Mandela (@KidFury) April 20, 2015\n\nJenner eventually addressed the challenge on Twitter, saying she wants people to be themselves and experiment with their own styles.\n\nI'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look. (Cont\u2026) \u2014 Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) April 21, 2015\n\nI want to encourage people/young girls like me to be YOURSELF & not be afraid to experiment w your look. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) April 21, 2015\n\nThis latest trend shows the lengths people will go to achieve Instagram beauty standards\n\nBeauty trends have changed drastically over the years. Thin eyebrows are no longer popular, and blue eye shadow is a thing of the past. But whereas beauty companies and famous models once created these fads, we now look to Instagram \u2013 and it\u2019s becoming a problem.\n\nAccording to the BBC, a review of 20 studies concluded that scrolling through photo-based apps like Instagram often correlates with negative perceptions of body image.\n\n\u201cPeople are comparing their appearance to people in Instagram images, or whatever platform they\u2019re on, and they often judge themselves to be worse off,\u201d Jasmine Fardouly, a postdoctoral researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, told the BBC.\n\nRead more: A fitness influencer Photoshopped herself to meet the beauty standards of Instagram\u2019s most-followed women to prove social media isn\u2019t real life\n\nUltimately, I don\u2019t think most people will add this eyelash-glue trick to their daily makeup routine, or post about it on Instagram, for that matter. However, I did notice that in many videos about the subject, some people said they would try the hack before taking Instagram photos, even if they wouldn\u2019t wear glue on their lips daily.\n\nThough I don\u2019t personally face a ton of body-confidence issues, I\u2019ve still found my mood completely altered after scrolling through Instagram in the past. At the start of the year, I even made a point to unfollow any account that made me feel even slightly insecure.\n\nI can only imagine that other people, particularly young women, will be similarly affected by seeing their peers on Tik Tok, Instagram, or other platforms strive for filler-style lips through this tactic.\n\nLike other viral beauty hacks, this trend could potentially be dangerous\n\nAccording to dermatologists, the eyelash-glue hack can cause problems ranging from irritation to wrinkles. Speaking to Insider, Dr. Joshua Zeichner, who works as the Director of Cosmetic & Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, explained the latter.\n\n\u201cThe adhesive used to attach fake eyelashes is generally well tolerated,\u201d Dr. Zeichner said. \u201cStill, I have two potential concerns with applying it around the mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst off, you need to make sure not to swallow any of the glue,\u201d he said. \u201cSecondly, if you are folding the lips to the skin, it will cause wrinkling of the skin in that area over time.\u201d\n\nEven more seriously, Dr. Marisa Garshick, a New York-based dermatologist, said eyelash glue can act as an irritant.\n\n\u201cWhile this trend may seem like a good way to determine what you would look like with a fuller lip, applying eyelash glue to the skin around the mouth can cause sensitivity of the skin which can appear red and irritated,\u201d Dr. Garshick said.\n\n\u201cThis can be due to an irritant or allergic contact dermatitis, which can occur due to the adhesive itself or the ingredients it contains,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf interested in a fuller lip, it is recommended to check with a board-certified dermatologist to determine the best options for you.\u201d\n\nUltimately, this trend should have been stopped before it even started\n\nAt the end of the day, there are probably worse viral trends than the eyelash-glue hack. Does either the Tide Pod or Cinnamon challenges ring a bell?\n\nAside from a few moments of laughter, I don\u2019t see many reasons why the eyelash-glue hack should go on any longer.", "description": "Business Insider - According to dermatologists, the practice could actually be harmful and cause irritation across the face..
