They immediately took the third-grader at Wrightstown Elementary School to a primary care clinic, where his sickness took a turn for the worse and his skin began to turn yellow as well.\n\nCourtesy James Auten\n\nBrayden was admitted to the Children's Hospital of Milwaukee on April 26.\n\nAfter doing an ultrasound, doctors found that his liver was functioning incorrectly. As the days passed, Brayden\u2019s liver stopped working completely.\n\n\"We were terrified. \u2026 We didn't know what was going on for the first week,\" James Auten told ABC News Thursday. \"As parents, we just wanted to know what was going on with our son.\"\n\nCourtesy James Auten\n\nEven though the doctors were unsure about which virus Brayden had that was causing his liver to fail, they knew that he needed a liver transplant as soon as possible. The family began scrambling to find a match for their son. Many family members and friends were tested to see whether they were a match but no one was.\n\nCami Loritz, a nurse who works in the transplant intensive care unit at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, heard of Brayden\u2019s situation and wanted to help in some way. She signed up to be a living donor and decided to give part of her liver to Brayden, according to ABC News Milwaukee affiliate WISN-TV.\n\nLoritz's surgery took place on May 14 at Froedtert Hospital. Brayden's took place on the same day at the Children's Hospital of Milwaukee.\n\nJames Auten told ABC News that they didn't know Loritz because she wanted to stay anonymous, but said she \"was going to meet us once the surgery was successful.\"\n\nCourtesy James Auten\n\nTwo weeks after surgery, the hospital set up a meeting for Loritz and Brayden to meet in the hospital where they embraced each other with hugs.\n\n\"Brayden was nervous and I don't think fully understood what happened and what she did. \u2026 He does now though and thinks of her like a big sister,\" Auten said.\n\n\"It was fun meeting him and seeing him, like, starting to feel better. I had no reason not to go through it,\" Loritz told WISN-TV.\n\nIn a Sept. 4 post on Facebook, Loritz thanked her family, friends and hospital family for supporting her and Brayden.\n\n\"Now that we are almost 4 months post-transplant it\u2019s heartwarming seeing Brayden enjoy being a kid again, no argument he\u2019s stinkin\u2019 cute! I am beyond thankful his family gets the chance to have their little boy back and healthy,\" Loritz said. \"With that said, both the Auten\u2019s and I don\u2019t want this happy ending to end here. ... Living organ donation is a FEASIBLE concept to SAVE LIVES! On top of all the love and support we\u2019ve received we\u2019re asking for your help to educate the public and raise awareness about living organ donation. Help us lessen the deficit between the number of organs needed and the number of organs available. ... *Special shout out and thank you to the Transplant Team, Transplant ICU, and 4NW staff (especially nurses \ud83d\ude09) at Froedtert Hospital for making this all possible!\"\n\nCourtesy James Auten\n\nOn June 4, Brayden was released from the hospital and moved to a Ronald McDonald House for a few weeks.\n\nJames Auten said that Brayden is doing great and all his vitals are stable. He said that his family still hasn\u2019t found out Brayden\u2019s diagnosis and that doctors told him they probably won\u2019t ever find out.", "description": "Brayden Auten, 8, was suffering from liver failure until Cami Loritz, a nurse in the intensive care unit at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, donated hers.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/kidney-1-ht-er-190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
