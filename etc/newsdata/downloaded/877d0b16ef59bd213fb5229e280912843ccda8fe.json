Fans chanted his nickname. And in the process of all of that, Peterson broke another milestone.\n\nBut after the Redskins\u2019 31-21 loss Sunday to the Dallas Cowboys, Peterson could only enjoy becoming the NFL\u2019s fifth all-time rushing leader in touchdowns to a certain point. The former MVP surpassed Jim Brown, but called the moment \u201cbittersweet\u201d \u2014 given the Redskins failed to win the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIt just continues to show me how blessed I am to continue to play this game in Year 13, to have had the opportunity and ability to pass the greats who paved the way. (Brown) was the first one that paved the way for us.\u201d\n\nPeterson was thrust back into the spotlight last week when the Redskins discovered second-year running back Derrius Guice needed surgery to repair a torn meniscus. Suddenly, Peterson went from a healthy scratch in Week 1 to the Redskins\u2019 starting running back once again.\n\nThe Redskins, though, didn\u2019t rely on Peterson as heavily Sunday as they did throughout last season. Peterson finished with just 25 yards on 10 carries, and Washington largely abandoned the run when it started to trail.\n\nPeterson\u2019s role in the offense will continue to be a topic moving forward. Coach Jay Gruden said on Wednesday Peterson would \u201cfor sure\u201d be the starter with Guice out, but how much will he be used? Fox\u2019s Pam Oliver reported during Sunday\u2019s game that Gruden \u201cis still not favor of Peterson\u2019s strength, a North-South running style.\u201d Oliver said Gruden feels like Peterson\u2019s style limits the offense.\n\nGruden said the Redskins need to \u201cget our running game going in some way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nEarly on, the Redskins looked they were going to have success on the ground. After safety Montae Nicholson picked off quarterback Dak Prescott in the first, Peterson immediately picked up six- and four-yard gains on Washington\u2019s first two plays. The Redskins wideout Steven Sims on a series of jet sweeps to approach the red zone. Following a 10-yard pass to Trey Quinn, Peterson and Sims each made plays to put Washington on the verge of scoring.\n\nOn the goal line, the Redskins lined up in I-formation and let Peterson go to work. The seven-time Pro Bowler was denied on his first attempt, but bullied his way on his second carry.\n\nThe touchdown was Peterson\u2019s 107th of his career, one more than Brown, who played from 1957 to 1965.\n\n\u201cThis one means a lot more than the other ones will when I pass them because Jim Brown is a guy I looked up to,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI had the opportunity to talk to him on several occasions and just the look in his eyes when I\u2019m talking to him, it\u2019s just motivating to me.\n\n\u201cIt feels so good to have passed him today, but it\u2019s bittersweet because we didn\u2019t get this divisional win.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
