With this being the Bellator welterweight grand prix final, MacDonald and Lima also are fighting for a tournament title belt and a $1 million grand prize.\n\nWhen they fought at Bellator 192, MacDonald, who failed in his only UFC title fight, was coming off a submission win over Paul Daley in his Bellator debut. Lima, meanwhile, was in his second reign as champion and defended his title six months prior by defeating Lorenz Larkin at Bellator NYC.\n\nThat set the stage for a memorable five-round war between MacDonald and Lima at Bellator 192. And while MacDonald left the cage with gold that night at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif., it wasn\u2019t without consequences \u2013 he left the arena on a stretcher after Lima brutalized his leg with kicks.\n\nTo get ready for their Bellator 232 headliner, watch the first fight between MacDonald (21-5-1 MMA, 3-1-1 BMMA) and Lima (31-7 MMA, 13-3 BMMA) in the video above.\n\nBellator 232 takes place at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., with a main card that streams on DAZN.", "description": "Rory MacDonald left the cage a champion on this night, but Douglas Lima didn't let it happen without consequences.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Mmajunkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/douglas-lima-rory-macdonald-bellator-192.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
