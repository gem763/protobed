Like, did you know computers can actually smell now?\n\nIt\u2019s true. This month, Google Brain team researchers explained how they\u2019ve created AI machine learning algorithms which can evaluate a molecule\u2019s structure, then accurately identify its particular odor. While the tech is still in a rudimentary stage, it\u2019s a development that could have huge implications in the fields of chemistry, neuro-science and nutrition. And you better believe perfume makers and other consumer science sectors are keenly interested too!\n\nIt\u2019s just one example of the wide range of machine learning innovations that are rewriting the laws of data science almost every day. And of course, that comes with a similar explosion of career opportunities for machine learning experts.\n\nYou can jump into this boundary-pushing field \u2014 or just learn some really cool stuff \u2014 with the training in The Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Certification Bundle. It\u2019s a $1,600 training package now slashed to just $29 from TNW Deals.\n\nThe collection features eight courses that pull back the curtain on this expanding tech field and its startling implications.\n\nThis training not only covers the building blocks of data science like data wrangling and visualization for the uninitiated, but also explores how Python programming makes it all happen as well as the roles of key frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras. You\u2019ll even get some practical hands-on lab work to start actually using machine learning tools and techniques for yourself.\n\nWith machine learning experts earning anywhere from $90,000 to well north of six figures annually, this training can open the door to new career prospects \u2014 and an entirely new tax bracket.\n\nGet it now for less than $4 per course while this deal lasts.\n\nPrices subject to change.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tnw Deals"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnwDeals?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fsale_22723_primary_image_wide.jpg&signature=0ef34c1524e763e59a41462054410a10", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
