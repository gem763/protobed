But he also made clear that he didn\u2019t want to go to war with the Islamic Republic.\n\nNow, Tehran is holding the president to that, while U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lobbies for international support to punish Iran for the attack.\n\nCrafty Iran Plays Pompeo Against Trump\n\nIran\u2019s craftiness was visible on Thursday when Foreign Minister Javad Zarif appeared to drive divisions between Pompeo and Trump, describing the state secretary as part of a renegade camp at the White House that was trying to instigate the president into a war he didn\u2019t need.\n\nFor a moment, Zarif could have almost been forgiven for sounding like a Trump ally who was helping the president look out against enemies in his own cabinet.\n\nAnd while he mentioned no other names, Zarif appeared to be citing the renegade camp once led by Trump\u2019s former national security advisor John Bolton. The president sacked Bolton earlier this month, after disagreeing with most of his recommendations agitating for battle with Iran.\n\nSaudi Crisis Makes Trump And Iranians Strange Bedfellows\n\nAs ludicrous as it was to expect any real camaraderie between them, Trump\u2019s aversion to war has strangely made him the Iranians\u2019 best hope in the current crisis involving Saudi Arabia. Fact of the matter: While the Saudis might wish to blow their worst enemy off the face of earth, Trump wants to keep them alive.\n\nSince the president called off a missile hit against Iran in June after deciding it to be an excessive response to the shooting down of a U.S. drone by Tehran, decision makers in the Islamic Republic have found Trump increasingly predictable.\n\nJust days before the Sept. 14 Saudi attack, Trump was trying to coax Iran to the negotiation table so that U.S. sanctions against Tehran could be suspended while a new nuclear deal is worked out between them. The rest of the administration was, meanwhile, pressing ahead with the campaign to inflict \u201cmaximum pain\u201d on Iran through sanctions \u2014 another Trump policy that the president falls back on whenever diplomacy with Tehran fails.\n\nWTI Weekly Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nU.S. sanctions against Iran have been in place since November last year, after Trump unilaterally pulled the United States out of a global nuclear pact with the Islamic Republic sealed by his predecessor, Barack Obama. He then demanded that Iran renegotiate with his administration. Tehran refused, causing a new escalation in Middle East tensions since.\n\nSaid John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital:\n\n\u201cIn Trump, the Iranians have found someone they can manipulate as he keeps the strike option off the table, allowing them they do as they please with minimal risk.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Trump announced on Wednesday that he had ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to \u201csignificantly\u201d enhance sanctions against Tehran, after stopping short of outrightly accusing Iran for the attack on Saudi Arabia.\n\nYemen-based Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they used drones to hit the Abqaiq crude processing complex and Khurais oilfield, temporarily knocking out 5.7 million barrels of Saudi oil output, or 5% of daily world supply. Pompeo, however, said U.S. evidence showed that the weapons were fired from southwest Iran.\n\nPompeo, Zarif Exchange Blazing Rhetoric\n\nVisiting Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, Pompeo invoked Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, describing \u201cthe fingerprints of the Ayatollah as having put at risk the global energy supply\u201d. He also called the attack an \u201cact of war\u201d and lobbied for the formation of an international group to deter Iran.\n\nZarif responded with his own blazing rhetoric on Twitter:\n\n\u201c\u2019Act of war\u2019 or AGITATION for WAR? Remnants of #B_Team (+ambitious allies) try to deceive @realdonaldtrump into war.\u201d\n\nHe also promised an \u201call-out war\u201d as payback for the alleged war crimes committed in Yemen by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. The Houthis say Saudi air strikes in Yemen, assisted by U.S. intelligence and logistical support, had indiscriminately killed thousands of innocent civilians.\n\nAdded Zarif to his tweet:\n\n\u201cFor their own sake, they should pray that they won't get what they seek. They're still paying for much smaller #Yemen war they were too arrogant to end 4yrs ago.\u201d\n\nThe Saudis Might Still Get Their Hit At Iran\n\nDespite Iran\u2019s bet that the Saudi attack will come to pass without risk for itself, a report in the Washington Post earlier this week suggested that Riyadh was planning a counterattack on Iran\u2019s Abadan oil refinery, one of the world's largest, or Kharg Island, the republic\u2019s biggest oil export facility. Attacks on either location are expected to significantly impede Iran's ability to process and sell oil.\n\nOther targets include missile launch sites, bases or other assets belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite Iranian military unit blamed for much of Iran's paramilitary operations against adversaries outside the country.\n\nThe report said Saudi Arabia could carry out the strikes with U.S. intelligence, targeting and surveillance capabilities, although the United States itself would not fire any weapon. That would be in line with Trump\u2019s remarks earlier this week that he was \u201clocked-and-loaded\u201d to respond to Iran, but \u201cnot ready for war\u201d.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Crude Oil WTI Futures.
