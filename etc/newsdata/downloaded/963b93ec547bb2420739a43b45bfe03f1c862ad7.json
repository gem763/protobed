All about Jennifer Lawrence's art dealer love New love: Jennifer Lawrence is seen with Cooke Maroney in New York back in June 2018 on one of their first dates Jennifer Lawrence has dated a string of stars, from Coldplay's Chris Martin to actor Nicholas Hoult and director Darren Aronofsky. But unlike her famous exes the newlywed's brand new husband, Cooke Maroney, is no celebrity - with the 34-year-old working as an art dealer in New York City. Here we look at what is known about the new Mr Jennifer Lawrence. Maroney was born in New York to parents, Suki Fredericks and James Maroney, an art dealer in Manhattan who previously served as the Head of American Paintings at Christie's. In 1986 the two decided to move the family to Vermont to raise the toddler Cooke and his younger sister Annabelle in a more simplistic way. The brother and sister grew up on the 750 acre organic Oliver Hill Farm in Leicester, Vermont, just outside of Middlebury. Their parents still live on the farm today, hosting weddings and letting out a three-bedroom guest house through AirBnB - on which they are superhosts. Suki writes on the site: 'We've been on our farm since 1986, moving up from NYC, fortunate to have raised our kids and stewarded various animals and the land organically. It is a wonderful place to live and to visit.' The farm has cows grazing on the fields, free-range hens clucking around the orchards and is near trails, and a river and reservoir. After graduating from high school in Vermont, Cooke went to New York University. Today Cooke is the director of the high-end Gladstone 64 Gallery in New York City. Falling in love: The couple are seen kissing in November last year at an ice hockey match in New York Wedding planning: Jennifer and Cooke are seen in May this year A regular at swanky art exhibitions in the Big Apple, he formerly worked for the Gagosian gallery. In his post at the venerated Gotham art gallery, Maroney worked alongside noted artists including Carroll Dunham (who is Lena Dunham\u2018s father), Anish Kapoor, and Matthew Barney, the ex of Bjork. It is not known how Cooke and Lawrence first met, with initial reports that they were introduced by her friend Laura Simpson described as 'erroneous' by a source. Soon to wed: The pair enjoy a date on October 10", "description": "Lawrence has been friends with Stone for quite some time, even interviewing her last year for her Elle cover.
