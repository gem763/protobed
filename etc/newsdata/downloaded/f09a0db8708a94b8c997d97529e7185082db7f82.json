Walking those streets meant you were taking your life into your hands.\n\nThanks to Republicans\u2019 aggressive law-and-order policies, today, most U.S. cities are astonishingly safe. Crime is at its lowest level in decades. Life is possible again!\n\nBut Joe Biden, the leading Democratic candidate for president, is said to be hurt by the fact that, as The New York Times puts it, \u201che championed the 1994 crime bill that many experts now associate with mass incarceration.\u201d\n\nPoint One: What\u2019s the matter with \u201cmass incarceration\u201d?\n\nAre we supposed to stop incarcerating people who commit crimes? Is that the argument? If there are hundreds of innocent people in prison, why do liberals keep giving us the fake sob stories -- the cases they lie about, forcing me to look up the facts, as illustrated in several of my recent columns?\n\nPoint Two: By \u201cmany experts,\u201d the Times means \u201craving lunatics we keep on speed-dial for when we need a quote we agree with.\n\nIn fact, the only theory by which Biden\u2019s crime bill -- technically the \u201cClinton Crime Bill\u201d -- attacked crime was by ushering in the first Republican Congress in 40 years, as a result of including the \"assault weapons\" ban in the bill.\n\nIn the very next election, just two months after the bill was signed, long-serving Democrats lost their seats, one after another after another.\n\nApart from that, the 1994 Crime Bill didn\u2019t do much. There was \u201cmidnight basketball\u201d; the \u201cViolence Against Women Act\u201d (feminist nonsense, later held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court); loads of pointless federal funding for local law enforcement; innumerable death penalties added for capital offenses committed on this or that federal property; and the aforementioned \u201cassault weapons ban,\u201d or \u201cGift From God to the GOP.\u201d\n\nBut Biden and Clinton were at least savvy enough to know that Democrats had to try to steal the crime issue from Republicans, even if only with meaningless gestures.\n\nNot today\u2019s Democrats! Biden\u2019s opponents seem to be competing for the title of \u201cCandidate Most Likely to Return Murder and Mayhem to Our Streets\u201d!\n\nAs with all the left\u2019s insane ideas, they\u2019re packaging this as an attack on \u201cracism.\u201d Let\u2019s take a stroll down memory lane, for a reminder of who bears the brunt of cretinous liberal crime policies.\n\nIn the late 1980s, it was the Congressional Black Caucus that was demanding tougher policies in the war on drugs. At a three-day Congressional Black Caucus Legislative Weekend in September 1989, Rep. Charlie Rangel held hearing after hearing on the devastation crack cocaine was raining on the black community.\n\nThe CBC being Democrats, the gist of the hearing was to attack President George H.W. Bush ... for not fighting the war on drugs with sufficient ferocity. Thus, Rev. Jesse Jackson testified:\n\n\u201c(P)resident Bush's plan ... greatly underestimates the military arsenals and viciousness of the drug lords and pushers who not only have deadly firepower from AK-47s to Uzis, superior to the weapons of the police, they have a reckless attitude and no respect for human life. ...\n\n\u201c(Drug) pushers are terrorists. Those who consume drugs are engaged in treason against themselves, their families and their communities. ...\n\n\u201cWe demand a right to volunteer in the army -- (audience applause) -- to fight a war on drugs.\u201d\n\nThroughout the 1980s, The New York Times was full of reports about the scourge of crack cocaine in neighborhoods \u201cwhere Americans -- especially minorities -- do worst.\u201d\n\nThere were stories of dealers preying on \u201cpoor blacks\u201d who \u201ccoughed up enough $5 bills\u201d for a vial of crack; an account of two little girls in the Bronx, children of crack-addicted mothers, \u201cresorting to prostitution and falling prey to a (65-year-old) neighborhood man for $5 or $10\u201d; and reports of dealers who \u201coffered two-for-one deals and 'Mother's Day' specials timed to coincide with the arrival of welfare checks.\u201d\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News Poll, taken after President Bush gave a speech in 1989 announcing his \u201cWar on Drugs,\u201d showed that 68% of black respondents approved of his plan -- or six times as many as voted for him. While only about half of white respondents characterized drugs as a \u201ccrisis\u201d in their neighborhoods, two-thirds of African Americans did.\n\nAnd then, in 1993, Rudy Giuliani became mayor of New York and saved the \u201cungovernable city.\" By the end of his two terms in office, murders in the city -- mostly blacks killing other blacks -- had been slashed from about 2,500 a year to 900. With subsequent mayors continuing his policies, whether with enthusiasm or out of fear of the voters, the murder rate has continued to fall.\n\nThousands of black people are alive today who otherwise would not be because of Giuliani\u2019s tough-on-crime policies. As the Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem\u2019s Abyssinian Baptist Church, put it, without Giuliani, \u201cwe would have been overrun.\u201d\n\nIf Jordan Peele wants a new idea for a conspiracy movie involving race, how about this one: Powerful liberals conspire to kill off black Americans and replace them with Mexicans by pushing lenient crime policies that put violent criminals into black neighborhoods, while simultaneously demanding open-borders immigration policies.\n\nHe can pick up some script ideas this Thursday, at the third Democratic presidential debate.", "description": "The left has the luxury of having lost the argument .09/12/2019 3:08:01AM EST.", "authors": ["Ann Coulter", "Beth Baumann", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/ce80875a-b702-4acb-9a49-995caed61b75.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
