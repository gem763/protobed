The so-called Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) will meet again Thursday in New York City on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nSix months have passed since the last meeting and unfortunately, though not at all surprisingly, the committee\u2019s well-intentioned efforts have not changed the downward trajectory of Palestinian lives and futures at all.\n\nPalestinians are among the largest recipients of donor assistance per capita in the world today. Yet despite decades of work, billions of dollars, euros, shekels, and dinars donated, life continues to get worse in Gaza and in what some call the West Bank and others call Judea and Samaria.\n\nTOP TRUMP DIPLOMAT SHARES PLANS FOR FUTURE PEACE ACCORDS BETWEEN ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS\n\nHamas has driven Gaza to a state of utter desperation. With unemployment at nearly 50 percent (the highest in the world), Hamas\u2019 decade-long experiment in governance is an utter failure.\n\nThe West Bank has fared better, but efforts there are frustrated by the Palestinian Authority\u2019s self-made budget crisis, its continued diversion of funding to reward terrorists, and an anti-normalization movement that delegitimizes Palestinians who do business with Israel.\n\nDonor countries must ask themselves why they should keep struggling to raise money when everyone can plainly see the Hamas regime and the Palestinian Authority are squandering the opportunities that donor money provides for a better future for all Palestinians.\n\nJust this week Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said: \u201cWe won\u2019t deduct one penny from the salaries of our prisoners, martyrs and the injured.\u201d\n\nIs that where donor countries want their limited tax dollars to go? Many of the recipients of these salaries murdered, or attempted to murder, Israelis in terrorist attacks (or the money is given to the murderers\u2019 families if the murderer has died).\n\nPeace requires that we acknowledge the basic reality of the situation on the ground, where policies have worked, and where they have failed.\n\nThere is no need to rehash the conventional approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is a path that has been taken year after year. But undoubtedly, many of the speakers at the AHLC meeting Thursday will make the same political speeches, with the same tired points, that will lead to absolutely nothing.\n\nThe conventional approach has brought us no closer to a final peace agreement. It has not ensured the security of the people of Israel. It has not delivered the Palestinians the dignity and prosperity they deserve. And ultimately, it has led to the Israelis and Palestinians being let down again and again.\n\nWe cannot afford another quarter-century of overpromising and under-delivering. We need a new approach. Rather than recycling the same policies and talking points that have brought us no closer to peace, we have looked at the reality on the ground with fresh eyes and in a realistic manner.\n\nClearly, none of our financial assistance is getting the Israelis and Palestinians closer to a peaceful solution to their long conflict.\n\nEach of the donor countries has limited assistance available to provide to Palestinians. When it comes to aid from the United States, we have determined that our aid dollars could provide more benefit to other parts of the world. We will not continue to invest in temporary solutions that only prolong the cycle of suffering and violence.\n\nIn June we laid out an economic plan that would invigorate the Palestinian economy as well as the surrounding region if we achieve a peace agreement. The Palestinian Authority boycotted our workshop and tried to stop others from attending. When some brave Palestinians attended they were bullied, threatened and had their businesses confiscated.\n\nYet for a donor conference \u2013 where money is given without expectation for a return or controls to ensure maximum impact \u2013 the Palestinian Authority will attend in force. It is time to demand more of the Palestinian leaders.\n\nThis past week I met with some Palestinians and they were exceedingly clear that they want investment and not donations. They want real opportunity, a real economic future. They want this now. They expressed serious gratitude about our efforts. Their expressions of gratitude, friendship and support of our efforts were extremely moving to me.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe many Palestinians I meet want the opportunities we are seeking for them. They may disagree with some (in some cases all) of our political positions and policies, but they understand we are also trying to improve their lives.\n\nPalestinians deserve greater dignity, greater opportunity and greater freedoms, none of which will be accomplished through maintaining the status quo of donations. It won\u2019t help in the West Bank and it certainly won\u2019t help in Gaza.\n\nI\u2019ve looked in the eyes of the courageous Palestinians who met with me this week and over the past year \u2013 in some cases at the risk of imprisonment or worse. They deserve better and they deserve more.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSo on behalf of the many Palestinians whom I\u2019ve met with and have developed deep relationships with, I want to ask the donor countries the hard question these Palestinians would ask if they were able to publish this op-ed with me: \u201cCan donor countries be bold enough to let the Palestinian people take a step forward, or will donor countries sentence them to more of the same?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to help Palestinians live better lives. And in that process, hopefully we will also achieve peace.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JASON GREENBLATT", "description": "Palestinians are among the largest recipients of donor assistance per capita in the world today.
