Show Hide On 25 July, US president Donald Trump called Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During the course of the call he reportedly asked the Ukrainian leader eight times to investigate former US vice-president Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. It is additionally reported that Trump ordered his staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine days before the call took place. Biden is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination and take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Trump confirmed he discussed the Bidens with Zelenskiy, and accused the pair \u2013 without offering any evidence \u2013 of corruption. A US intelligence community whistleblower filed a report after becoming alarmed at Trump\u2019s behaviour in the matter. The White House refused to release the substance of the whistleblower complaint, setting up a confrontation with Congress over the release of information. Complaints of this nature are usually reported to Congress within seven days. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, has admitted asking the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens. It is illegal for a political campaign to accept a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. Democrats say an investigation into a political opponent \u2013 for which Trump appears to have been pushing \u2013 would amount to a thing of value.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday, Ryaboshapka said he had no evidence of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden and had not been contacted by Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who has spearheaded an informal investigation into the Biden family for the US president.\n\nTrump has demanded the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, open an investigation into Hunter Biden for his work in Ukraine, and into his father for urging the country to fire the then general prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.\n\nAsked whether he would investigate the pair, Ryaboshapka said he was holding an \u201caudit of all cases\u201d, a docket numbering in the thousands, which could include about 15 relating to the energy company Burisma.\n\nIn a follow-up statement, Ryaboshapka said his office was reviewing \u201chigh-profile proceedings concerning senior officials\u201d under the former president Viktor Yanukovych, including cases tied to Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nThe statement stressed \u201cno procedural decisions\u201d had been made against Zlochevsky or \u201cany persons related\u201d.\n\nThe decision is not a full accession to Trump\u2019s demands, as the earlier Burisma cases under review do not directly involve Hunter Biden or his father\u2019s political influence.\n\nRyaboshapka\u2019s remarks on Friday appeared to be part of Ukraine\u2019s continued strategy of resisting the Trump administration\u2019s demands for a full investigation, while avoiding antagonising the US president. Ukraine, where a revolution took place in 2014, relies heavily on the US and Europe for financial support for reforms and military aid.\n\nTrump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate his potential opponent in the 2020 elections has led to an impeachment inquiry in Washington.\n\nShokin was widely regarded as corrupt, and there is no evidence Biden sought to have him fired for investigating Burisma.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s appointment to the board of directors of Burisma, with a reported monthly salary of $50,000 (\u00a341,000), has been the subject of an investigation by Giuliani. The former New York mayor has collected evidence from several former Ukrainian prosecutors to try to discredit Biden before the elections.", "description": "Ruslan Ryaboshapka distances audit from US president\u2019s call for investigation into Biden ties", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0496df1a2780eae68019d0c127632dc9d35983a/0_284_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6221b482320b06997561b13d4fed495c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
