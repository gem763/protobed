REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey\u2019s ruling AK Party wants to eject former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu and three other lawmakers, a senior official said on Monday, amid talk of a possible new breakaway movement.\n\nDavutoglu, who fell out with President Tayyip Erdogan in 2016 and was later replaced as prime minister by Binali Yildirim, has previously criticised AKP policies, government economic management and Erdogan himself.\n\nAt a meeting on Monday, the AKP\u2019s central executive committee demanded that Davutoglu, along with Ayhan Sefer Ustun, Selcuk Ozdag and Abdullah Basci, be dismissed from the party, the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.\n\nThe party\u2019s disciplinary council is expected to rubber-stamp that in the next few days.\n\nThe move comes amid rumours that dissident party members are seeking to form a rival party following a stinging AKP defeat in Istanbul local elections in June that was one of the biggest setbacks in Erdogan\u2019s career.\n\nIn July, former Turkish deputy prime minister Ali Babacan resigned from the AKP, citing \u201cdeep differences\u201d and hinting at the formation of a new party.\n\nBabacan, along with former president Abdullah Gul, plans to launch a rival movement this year, according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that could further challenge Erdogan\u2019s political grip.\n\nDavutoglu had been rumoured to be mulling joining Babacan and Gul\u2019s breakaway party. But a source close to him said he was not joining them for now, though he was planning a \u201cnew step\u201d.", "description": "Turkey's ruling AK Party wants to eject former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu and three other lawmakers, a senior official said on Monday, amid talk of a possible new breakaway movement.", "authors": ["Orhan Coskun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425501048&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811JK"}
