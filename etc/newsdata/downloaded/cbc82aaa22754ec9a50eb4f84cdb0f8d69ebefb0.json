Sam is not alone in that 40-50yr group ministerial quality wanting to stay or go. I want them to stay. Does the Conservative Party?\"\n\nBut another Conservative MP, Crispin Blunt, said he felt \"betrayed\" by his decision to join the Lib Dems, claiming: \"You had every opportunity to be a team player with Surrey and other neighbouring colleagues and it's clear you've only been in this business for yourself.\n\n\"If I believed this was about a principled belief in the European ideal I would be minded to understand. In your case this is about a principled belief in Sam G.
