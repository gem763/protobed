(Image: Riccardo Federici, Marvel Comics)\n\nFor over 70 issues, Marvel\u2019s landmark Star Wars ongoing has explored the new hope that thrived in the wake of the Death Star\u2019s destruction. Now, as it comes to its end, it\u2019s tying up all its loose ends on the surface of Hoth, as the Empire begins to strike back.\n\nRevealed through the official Star Wars website this morning, after Marvel\u2019s ongoing series \u2014 helmed by current creative team Greg Pak, Phil Noto, and Clayton Cowles \u2014 comes to an end with its 75th issue this November, a final one-shot epilogue will release in December to tie up the loose ends of the series.\n\nCalled Star Wars: Empire Ascendant, the bumper-sized issue will be penned by Charles Soule, Greg Pak, Simon Spurrier, and Ethan Sacks, and feature art from a cavalcade of artists, including Luke Ross and Roland Boschi.\n\nEmpire Ascendant will mostly concern itself with establishing the status quo that opens The Empire Strikes Back \u2014 the Rebels having freshly set up Echo Base, finally coming to the end of a journey they\u2019ve been on for much of the Star Wars comic\u2019s runtime, and Darth Vader dispatching his fleets to hunt them down once and for all.\n\nBut, interestingly, Empire Ascendant will also \u201creveal the fates\u201d of two characters created in Marvel\u2019s vast oeuvre of Star Wars comics: Doctor Aphra and Beilert Valance.\n\nThe full cover for Star Wars: Empire Ascendant. (Image: Riccardo Federici, Marvel Comics)\n\nAphra has been one of the major successes when it came to characters created in the \u201cDisney\u201d era of Star Wars, a smuggler/archaeologist who went toe to toe with the Dark Lord himself (and brought a fun pair of killer droids with her along for the ride).\n\nA wholly new creation first introduced in Kieron Gillen and Salvador Larroca\u2019s sublime Darth Vader series, Aphra went on to star in her own currently ongoing series after the first Vader bookended \u2014 a series now seemingly coming to its own end with its 40th issue this December.\n\nBeilert Valance, meanwhile, has a more peculiar history: Initially, the character, a cybernetically enhanced bounty hunter, was introduced in Marvel\u2019s classic Star Wars comics back in the late \u201870s.\n\nRendered non-canonical when Disney and Lucasfilm chucked out the old Expanded Universe, this original version of Valance made his brief revival in the retro throwback Star Wars #108, a one-shot continuation of the original Marvel comic released as part of the company\u2019s 80th-anniversary celebrations earlier this year. But a new version of Valance actually made his way into the current Star Wars canon more recently, thanks to the current Target: Vader miniseries that has seen the vengeful cyborg tasked with trying to assassinate Vader himself.\n\nTying up all these stories together in Empire Ascendant \u2014 and ending them as we know them \u2014 effectively wipes Marvel\u2019s slate of Star Wars material clean. By December, the current Age of Resistance anthology series will have wrapped up (the final book under the banner, focusing on Kylo Ren, is due to release next week), as will the current tie-in prequel to the video game Jedi: Fallen Order, called Dark Temple.\n\nSo will have Star Wars: Allegiance, a four-issue miniseries releasing throughout October as part of the \u201cJourney to The Rise of Skywalker\u201d line of tie-in books for the upcoming movie.\n\nWith the release of Empire Ascendant closing the book on this era of Star Wars at Marvel, just one Star Wars series at the publisher will remain: The Rise of Kylo Ren, a limited series announced at San Diego Comic-Con. When that\u2019s over? Well, it seems incredibly unlikely that that\u2019ll be it for the galaxy far, far away at Marvel Comics.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that all this is happening just before The Rise of Skywalker hits theatres, however. Could a new generation of Star Wars books, perhaps ones set beyond the reaches of the original trilogy, emerge after the Skywalker Saga concludes at the box office?\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see. Always in motion, the future is...", "description": "For over 70 issues, Marvel\u2019s landmark Star Wars ongoing has explored the new hope that thrived in the wake of the Death Star\u2019s destruction.
