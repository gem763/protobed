Absolutely vile.\n\nFashion and beauty blogger, Georgia Grace, 22, from Watford, Hertfordshire, was left outraged after recieving her ASOS purchase\n\nGeorgia claimed that she found a sock inside one of the boots and took a picture of the item of clothing\n\nGeorgia then took to Twitter to voice ehr anger and wrote: 'I ordered some boots off of ASOS and I went to take the padding out to try them on and they have sent me them with a dirty sock in'\n\n'Where are your hygiene regulations?'\n\nShe later added: 'I went on the online chat about it and they told me to send them back, no apology, nothing. So, so, so, so vile. Actually want to be sick.'\n\nGeorgia posted an image showing her ASOS parcel alongside one with the crumpled black sock next to the stuffing that she took out of the boots to try them on.\n\nThe fashion blogger claims she did not initially receive an apology and was simply told to return the shoes.\n\nAfter calling the company she said she was given the explanation 'our warehouse is busy', and was again just told to send them back.\n\nSpeaking today, Georgia claimed she could tell the new boots 'had been worn' previously.\n\nInside the box was a dirty sock and padding that Georgia had removed from her boots in order to try them on\n\nThe fashion blogger took a picture of the box and the ASOS bag that the boots were delivered in\n\nGeorgia said she contacted ASOS first on a live chat and was told their warehouse was busy and she should send them back\n\nShe said: 'I was trying to find some boots for winter that were plain. So I ordered three pairs of boots, one pair didn't come.\n\n'One pair was wrapped in plastic and the other which were tall black lace up boots weren't.\n\n'I unlaced them and tried to pull out the stuff they put in it to stop them creasing at the bottom I pulled out a dirty black sock that someone had left in there.\n\n'You could tell that it had been worn.\n\n'I contacted ASOS first on a live chat and got no apology - they told me their warehouse is busy and I should send them back.\n\n'Then I called them and they just said sorry but that's it. When I tried to say it wasn't good enough on the chat, they just asked me, 'is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nGeorgia had purchased a pair of chunky high lace-up black boots online but was not happy with what she recieved\n\n'I was so disgusted someone's obviously worn these boots and they've not even checked what's in them.\n\n'It's so unhygienic, I was absolutely horrified. For them to not even apologise at first and then make excuses made it even worse.'\n\n'So I've boxed them up to send them back. I'm honestly still shocked, it was so gross.'\n\nMailOnline has contacted ASOS for comment.", "description": "Fashion and beauty blogger, Georgia Grace, 22, from Watford, Hertfordshire, was left outraged after claiming she found a 'dirty sock' inside her brand new pair of \u00a345 boots.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/14/19492072-0-image-a-5_1570626424982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
