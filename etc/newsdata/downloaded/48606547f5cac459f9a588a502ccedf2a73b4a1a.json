The players themselves, however, appear to be realising that the days of crosses and headers being the Premier League's bread and butter are long over.\n\nA decade ago, almost 50 crosses were being attempted in the average Premier League game. That figure has dropped consistently each season since, and now sits at around 35 per game.\n\nRemove set-pieces from the equation and it is the same story: 38.2 open play crosses were put into the box in 2008-09, with that figure plummeting to 24.2 in 2018-19.\n\nFootball statisticians Opta define a cross to include most balls played from a wide area (from a few yards into the box right out to the touchline) that is aimed into the middle with the intention of creating a chance. Even allowing for the many, many low balls across the face of goal that Pep Guardiola's Manchester City attempt - so often successfully - crosses are increasingly uncommon in the top flight.\n\nSome of the worst recent performances by the Premier League's bigger teams have been defined by a woefully ineffective focus on crossing. The day then-Manchester United manager David Moyes called \"as bad as it gets\" saw his side attempt a record 81 crosses in a home draw against bottom-of-the-league Fulham in February 2014, with visiting defender Dan Burn likening the tactics to \"Conference football\".", "description": "It is somehow still the case, 19 years into the 21st century, that not a single Premier League match will go by without a groan from the crowd when a player opts for a simple pass back to a team-mate in a deeper position rather than lump the ball into the box.", "authors": ["Alistair Tweedale", "Paul Hayward", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000212130979-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPmElMIBmVRNjiSSVNAe-nosBtPqh6bFn1nXaIkpGlBo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
