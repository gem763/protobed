The condition is rare, occurring in 1 in 50,000 births, according to the Generic and Rare Disease Information Center.\n\nWhen she was 18 months old, Daisy-May\u2019s parents Alex and Claire Demetre chose to have both of the young girl's legs amputated \u2014 the right above the knee and the left below the knee \u2014 in the hopes of giving her a better quality of life with prosthetics.\n\n\u201cWe had the choice for her to live like that or to go for the operation,\u201d Alex, Daisy-May\u2019s father, said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know at the time that Daisy-May would be as good as she is now.\u201d\n\nIndeed: Daisy-May is living proof determination can defy all odds. She is a gymnast as well as a model for Boden, the country\u2019s largest clothing catalog, according to SWNS. She\u2019s also modeled for Nike and the British retailer Matalan, among others.\n\nBut come Sept. 8, Daisy-May will take her modeling career to new heights when she walks the runway at New York Fashion Week. Daisy-May will walk for the French-inspired children's fashion line Lulu et Gigi Couture. She was approached about the opportunity after the line\u2019s founder and head designer, Eni Hegedus-Buiron, spotted her modeling in London.\n\n\u201cI was asked if I was OK with having an amputee walk in my show. To be honest I was surprised by the question. For me, a child is a child and thus is beautiful and perfect,\u201d Hegedus-Buiron told the outlet. \u201cSo of course I said yes.\u201d\n\nAlex told SWNS he is proud that his daughter will make history, but noted he and his wife hope to see more child amputees featured on the runway.\n\n\u201cDisability doesn\u2019t stop you \u2014 it definitely doesn't stop Daisy,\u201d Alex said, adding his daughter \u201cbelongs on the catwalk.\u201d\n\nILLINOIS BOY, 7, SCRAPS DISNEY TRIP TO MEET BONE MARROW DONOR\n\nThat said, modeling doesn't define Daisy-May. Rather, Alex said, it\u2019s a small part of who she is.\n\n\u201cShe just does Daisy, it is the way she goes about life with a smile on her face. Whether it's dancing, singing \u2014 she is a very special little girl,\u201d he said.", "description": "A young United Kingdom girl isn\u2019t letting her disability stop her from achieving her dreams.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
