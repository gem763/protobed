He is putting in hard work in the training sessions.\u201d\n\nSterling terrorised Kosovo in the opening 45 minutes at St Mary\u2019s as England racked up a commanding 5-1 half-time lead.\n\nHe created three goals, including one for Harry Kane, and also scored his eighth in his last eight games.\n\nIt is a far cry from the player who went over 1,000 minutes without scoring for his country, but the 24-year-old knew he would come good.\n\n\u201cGoing on that long drought, when I first came in an England shirt I didn\u2019t look at my stats,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cUntil I saw how bad they were I put extra pressure on myself to score. I said to myself that once my first goal went in I knew the goals would come after that and that is all I was waiting for.\n\n\u201cThat night in Spain when I scored two from then I knew I would kick on and score goals.\n\n\u201cThe last two years with my club has been terrific scoring goals and all I have wanted to do is do it on the international stage, not just score goals but score goals that will help my team to win football matches.\u201d\n\nEngland, who astonishingly trailed after only 34 seconds, might have been eyeing double figures at half-time but defensive howlers allowed Kosovo back into it.\n\nAnd Sterling knows if England have any designs to win major tournaments they have to cut it out.\n\n\u201cWe were ruthless at times and at this level, and we are playing at a high level now, at half-time that game has to be finished.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t give away sloppy chances, against bigger teams, no disrespect to Kosovo I thought they played some great football at times, we knew it was going to be difficult, but in the big tournaments against the better teams we can\u2019t be giving them any sort of any hope or opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe have got to finish the game off.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Raheem Sterling was delighted to come good on Jadon Sancho\u2018s late-night requests as he helped the teenager to his first England goals.
