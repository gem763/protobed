NBC released a statement, published via Vulture, that states that although the show first hired Gillis \u201con the strength of his talent as comedian and his impressive audition for SNL,\u201d producers were \u201cnot aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable,\u201d reads the statement, which comes from executive producer and show creator Lorne Michaels. \u201cWe are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\nGillis was chosen to appear as a featured player on the show at the same time SNL hired its first Asian American comedian, Bowen Yang. Creating a work environment where actors, writers, and crew members feel welcome is important, and it\u2019s likely producers took this into account when deciding what path to take with Gillis. That, on top of the immediate and intense backlash Gillis and SNL received over his hiring, appears to have led to his inevitable firing.\n\n\u201cI understand it would be too much of a distraction.\u201d\n\nGillis has responded to the firing on Twitter, stating that it feels \u201cridiculous for comedians to be making serious public statements but here we are.\u201d He added that he\u2019s a \u201ccomedian who was funny enough to get SNL,\u201d and that \u201ccan\u2019t be taken away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was always a MAD TV guy anyway,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cOf course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand it would be too much of a distraction,\u201d Gillis wrote. The comedian first issued a statement on his past remarks on Twitter last week, after he began to receive criticism and backlash. At the time, he argued that the remarks were a result of him being a \u201ccomedian who pushes boundaries,\u201d adding that sometimes he misses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said,\u201d Gillis wrote. \u201cMy intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d\n\nThe controversy over Gillis\u2019 statements have provoked comments from other comedians, actors, and even politician Andrew Yang, whom Gillis specifically targeted with a racial slur during a recent podcast taping. While Yang defended Gillis, saying he did not wish for the comedian to lose his job, other actors suggested SNL should part ways with him over the controversy.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t funny then, and it sure as hell isn\u2019t funny today,\u201d actor Simu Liu, who will appear in Marvel\u2019s Shang-Chi, tweeted in response to a video featuring Gillis using a racist expletive targeted at Asian people. \u201cThis word has been used to dehumanize my people for over 150 years. You don\u2019t get to use it in the name of edgy comedy.\u201d\n\nGillis\u2019 firing comes just one week ahead of SNL\u2019s season premiere.", "description": "Saturday Night Live today fired comedian Shane Gillis after a series of racist and homophobic comments he made in the past surfaced last week.
