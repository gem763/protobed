For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 If you've watched a Washington Nationals home game this year, chances are you've heard it.\n\nIf not, you may be confused during World Series games in the nation's capital.\n\n\"Baby Shark\" has taken over Nationals Park in 2019 and the team has embraced the undeniably-catchy children's song as a part of its celebrations throughout the season.\n\nThe trend began with outfielder Gerardo Parra, who started using the tune as a walk-up song while mired in a slump earlier in the year, as a nod to his two-year-old daughter.\n\nPlayers and fans alike immediately embraced the silliness.\n\nThe crowd in Washington does a synchronized shark chomp when Parra comes to the plate. Some fans come to the park dressed as sharks.\n\nNationals fans do the \"Baby Shark\" chomp with Gerardo Parra at the plate during Game 4 of the NLCS.

And what\u2019s even cooler and weirder is to look up in the stands and see middle-age men do a Baby Shark,\" Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said before the World Series. \"But that\u2019s the beautiful thing about sports \u2013 whether it\u2019s baseball or any other sport.\n\n\"It gives people three or four hours to forget about everything else and just have fun. Root for a team, or do a Baby Shark at the field.\u201d\n\nWhen Nationals players get a base hit, their on-field celebrations mirror the song. A single gets a finger pitch for Baby Shark, a double calls for hand-clapping like a Mommy Shark and a triple gets the full chomp for Daddy Shark.\n\n\"It's blown up pretty big. Everyone seems to be doing it,\" Nationals pitcher Patrick Corbin said before Game 3. \"People are wearing shark outfits. It's like Halloween out there. It's great.\"", "description": "If you've watched a Washington Nationals home game this year, chances are you've heard the 'Baby Shark' song.", "authors": ["Jesse Yomtov", "Published P.M.
