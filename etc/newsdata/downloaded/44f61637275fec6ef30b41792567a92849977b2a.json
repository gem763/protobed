Businessman Eddie Rispone finished in second place with 27 percent, qualifying to take on Edwards in a head-to-head battle in the runoff election. Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA) finished in third place with 23 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cEddie came from a poor working-class family in north Baton Rouge. He runs a very large contracting company. He\u2019s done very, very well for himself. He\u2019s just a wonderful, energetic person to be around. I think he\u2019s right for Louisiana in so many ways that our current governor is not right,\u201d Gurvich said of Rispone.\n\nGurvich was upbeat about Rispone\u2019s prospects in the November 16 runoff.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to win, and I think he\u2019s going to win handily. We\u2019re going to do very well in this race,\u201d Gurvich declared.\n\nThe chairman noted that higher voter turnout drove across-the-board gains for Republicans in Louisiana on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe had a great night up and down the ballot; it wasn\u2019t just in the governor\u2019s race,\u201d he told Boyle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re within range in both houses [in the state legislature] of obtaining a super majority, in the Senate and the House. Turnout was 20 percent above the 2015 levels. We got 52 percent of the vote, which I think is extremely important,\u201d Gurvich noted.\n\n\u201cThe governor, the current Democrat governor, John Bel Edwards, lost vote share in 62 of the 64 parishes of Louisiana. We call our counties parishes here. They spent an enormous amount of money, about 15 million bucks, and couldn\u2019t get above 47 percent, so this is huge for us,\u201d the Louisiana Republican chairman told Boyle.\n\nBoyle noted that Louisiana\u2019s gubernatorial \u201cjungle primary\u201d on Saturday was the first election in the nation after Speaker Pelosi\u2019s announcement of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThings were trending John Bel Edwards\u2019 way in the leadup to this. Then all of a sudden Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats \u2026 decided to move forward with this impeachment nonsense against President Trump,\u201d Boyle said.\n\nBoyle asked Gurvich if he thought this impeachment inquiry \u201cbackfired in a big way on John Bel Edwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president and Donald Jr. and the vice president all came to Louisiana. They all have tremendous charisma and energy. His support was huge in this. It\u2019s huge everywhere he goes,\u201d Gurvich noted, adding that it is difficult \u201cto try and distinguish the impeachment element from the president\u2019s charisma and energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI kind of felt about a month ago we were trending in the wrong direction. Then, as you say, the impeachment thing hit the airwaves. Remember we had 20 percent more folks, a higher level of folks, who voted in this election than last time,\u201d Gurvich noted.\n\n\u201cI think the impeachment had a lot to do with\u201d the higher turnout and the outcome of Saturday\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment was important. It really was, and the way impeachment has been handled, undercover, behind closed doors, nobody owning up to anything, I think the people of Louisiana resented it, and it showed in this election, \u201d Gurvich added.\n\nBoyle then noted that there are more big races for governor in two other states, Kentucky and Mississippi, before the November 16 runoff election in Louisiana. He asked Gurvich if the impeachment backlash evident in Louisiana is likely to carry into other states.\n\n\u201cI can intuit rather easily the way the folks in Mississippi, our next-door neighbors, are thinking about this race. \u2026 It\u2019s not just impeachment itself; it\u2019s the way it\u2019s happening: subterfuge everywhere that\u2019s just so underhanded. This is huge. It was huge in Louisiana. It\u2019s going to be huge in Mississippi, and it probably will be a tremendously important factor in Kentucky,\u201d Gurvich said.\n\nBoyle then asked if the support of \u201cradical lefty Democrats\u201d like Stacey Abrams and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), both of whom came to Louisiana in September and backed Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards, hurt him in the \u201cjungle primary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you elect a governor, you\u2019re electing his party. For the governor to say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a moderate Democrat,\u2019 if such a thing still exists, which is a question in and of itself. But, then again, he\u2019s a Hillary superdelegate,\u201d Gurvich noted, adding that \u201che says he\u2019s pro-life, but an enormous amount of his money comes from these entities that are pro-choice, the Green New Deal, and all those sorts of folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had an Obama robocall for him, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Gurvich noted.\n\n\u201cA victory for a Democrat governor in Louisiana is a victory that we can\u2019t afford. \u2026 Democrats have repeatedly proven they\u2019re not a right fit for the country, and John Bel Edwards isn\u2019t a right fit for the state,\u201d Gurvich concluded.\n\nListen to the full audio of the interview here:", "description": "The chair of the Louisiana State Republican Party said Eddie Rispone will defeat John Bel Edwards (D) in the gubernatorial runoff election.", "authors": ["Michael Patrick Leahy"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Eddie-Rispone-wide-smile-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
