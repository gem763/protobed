In Mexico, though, some have listed gender preference right alongside qualifications like \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cexperience.\u201d\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of sex is illegal in both countries, but in Mexico, it remains a regular\u2014and open\u2014practice. According to a Bloomberg analysis of more than 10,300 job ads posted during one week in August on the popular Mexican job site OCCMundial, more than 800 specified male or female applicants.\n\nMost were for local firms, but not all. Staffing giants Kelly Services, Adecco and Manpower designated some of their Mexico-based postings for men or for women. Home Depot Inc. was recruiting male sales associates. VF Outdoor Services sought a woman with \u201cexcellent presentation\u201d and \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d for an executive assistant role. Several local car dealerships did the same, along with Hyundai Glovis, a logistics subsidiary of the Korean car company.\n\nThe data examined by Bloomberg showed that, overall, ads targeted men for more senior or managerial positions. Women were recruited for secretarial and customer service roles. Job ads seeking men also offered higher salaries than openings for the same position but a preference for women.\n\nThose companies say the ads Bloomberg found aren\u2019t consistent with their policies or practice and have been fixed. Nonetheless, they illustrate the challenge of connecting company rhetoric with on-the-ground operations around the world. In August, Home Depot joined nearly 200 companies in signing a letter from the Business Roundtable that promised to foster \u201cdignity and inclusion\u201d in their operations. On its website, VF Corporation touts its \u201cGlobal Women\u2019s Advisory Council\u201d and its promise to achieve gender parity in its senior leadership by 2030.\n\n\u201cThis was an oversight for several job postings by stores in Mexico,\u201d a Home Depot spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThe job postings have been corrected and this has been addressed with the stores that posted them. Home Depot does not discriminate in hiring practice and is always looking for the best talent for the specific position.\u201d\n\nHyundai Glovis said the job ads reflected an error made by a new employee. \u201cThe part about gender was deleted immediately, the HR staff will be trained in company policy and law, and HR hiring processes will be strengthened,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHyundai GLOVIS Mexico does not discriminate on gender-related acts when hiring employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, a small percentage of job postings in Mexico that did not reflect our commitment to diversity and inclusion were brought to our attention and we have taken immediate action to correct these,\u201d a spokesman for Manpower said in an email. \u201cWe continue to review job posts on an ongoing basis to ensure they reflect our position on diversity and our commitment to equal employment opportunities.\u201d\n\nKelly Services said its recruiters in Mexico are trained and informed on compliant and ethical employment practices in the regions where they operate, and that the company \u201cnow will place postings to recruit individuals who are most qualified for the job duties at hand, without regard to immutable personal attributes.\u201d Addeco said that in Mexico, it has policies to prevent any mention of gender in a job posting \u201cunless there is a legitimate reason,\u201d and that it was looking into the job ads flagged by Bloomberg.VF Corp., parent of VF Outdoor Services, along with brands like Vans, The North Face and JanSport, didn\u2019t return several emails and phone calls seeking comment.\u201cGlobal companies should make sure that any standards they say they\u2019re holding themselves to are observed the world over,\u201d said John Paul Rollert, a behavioral science professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and \u201cin-house ethicist\u201d at the Chicago Booth Review. \u201cIf they're not, people will find out and they\u2019ll be held to account.\u201d\n\nOCCMundial is owned by SEEK Ltd., a $4.8 billion tech company based in Melbourne, Australia, that owns and operates job sites around the world. Sergio Porragas Moreno, OCCMundial\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, said the site\u2019s terms and conditions forbid discrimination in job postings, and the site retains the right to remove any post deemed \u201cillegal or abusive\u201d following a formal investigation.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Few multinational companies would publicly advertise some U.S.-based jobs to women and others to men.
