Meanwhile, China agreed to purchase $40 to $50 billion more agricultural products.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump called it a \u201csubstantial phase one\u201d agreement, which means they\u2019ll be a lot more meetings between the two countries as they work to further undo the conflict while also improving their business relationship.\n\n\n\nThe deal was good enough for a solid rally to end the week. The NASDAQ jumped 1.34% (or about 106 points) to 8057.04, while the increased 1.21% (or 319 points) to 26,816.59. The S&P was up 1.09% to 2970.27.\n\n\n\nThe indices did come well off their highs. The Dow was north of 500 points at its best.\n\n\n\nMost likely, the market\u2019s just being its usual demanding self. The deal doesn\u2019t end the conflict, nor does it pull back existing tariffs or even delay the ones scheduled for December.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s progress and potentially a first step on making more comprehensive changes. It\u2019s also a whole lot better than the two sides screaming at each other from across the ocean and retaliating with ever higher tariffs.\n\n\n\nPlus, today\u2019s rally was enough to break the Dow and S&P out of their three-week losing streaks. The indices were up 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively over the past 5 days. The NASDAQ was also up 0.9%, which makes for back-to-back positive weeks.\n\n\n\nNot bad for a week that started with a couple down days, including a selloff of well over 1% on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nSo is this deal enough to get stocks back to all-time highs? Earnings season will probably have a say in that regard, and it will start next week with a few of the big banks reporting.\n\n\n\nAnd believe it or not, but there may be some progress on the Brexit front as well.\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s enjoy this trade agreement for now, but remember that the fourth quarter is just getting started!\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nValue Investor: \"The market hates uncertainty so this (trade agreement) will soothe Wall Street, at least for a few weeks, or until something is actually signed. Otherwise, the big focal point now shifts to earnings season. Next week, the official beginning of earnings season begins with JP Morgan and the other major banks. It will then be a 2 to 3 week succession of all the big tech and industrial names, including FAANG.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, the economy is slowing but it's not in a recession. We've seen these manufacturing slowdowns in the past, including in 2015-2016, and the economy was able to get a second wind. I believe we're in another similar situation. The US consumer is still bullish and that can go a long way to keeping the economy out of a recession.\n\n\n\n\"Too many people were calling the recession and were pessimistic. It was a huge contrarian indicator. It simply isn't that bad out there. And now the Fed also has Wall Street's back. It's a combination for new highs in stocks. Buckle up. A bullish run could be coming this earnings season.\" -- Tracey Ryniec, who will see reports next week from JPMorgan (NYSE: ) and Synchrony (SYF) on Tuesday and Friday, respectively.\n\n\n\nHave a Great Weekend!\n\nJim Giaquinto\n\nRecommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.
