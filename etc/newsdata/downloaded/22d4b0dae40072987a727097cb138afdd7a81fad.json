A gunman is pictured outside a kebab shop close to the synagogue\n\nJewish leaders say the attacker tried to get into the synagogue in Halle during prayers for Yom Kippur, but were stopped by 'security measures'. A woman was then shot dead in the street outside (pictured, the attacker)\n\nArmed police swarmed to the scene after the gunman opened fire.

'I couldn't reach him any more.'\n\nWhile the man didn't reveal details of his final conversations with his Balliet, when asked whether he thought about his son after reports spread of an attack on a synagogue, he stayed silent and began weeping.\n\nRecords seen by Bilt reveal that Balliet graduated from high school and went on to study chemistry for two semesters at a higher education institution, but had to abandon his studies after a serious stomach operation.\n\nIt is not clear exactly what he did for work after quitting his studies, though a neighbour said he was working as a broadcasting technician at the time of the attack.\n\nVideo taken of Balliet during the rampage suggests he was at least familiar with combat tactics, even if he had no formal training, as he can be seen taking shelter while firing his weapons and moving around as a solider might.\n\nIn footage that he streamed online, Balliet also claims he built his weapons himself, suggesting a familiarity with mechanical engineering, though he can also be heard lamenting the fact that his guns keep jamming.\n\nIn a manifesto which was posted online as a PDF document, the author included pictures of the weapons and ammunition used in the attack, according to extremism monitoring service SITE.\n\nThe manifesto also mentioned a live-stream as well as his objective to kill 'anti-whites', including Jews.\n\n'This manifesto document, which appears to have been created a week ago on October 1, gives yet more indication how much planning and preparation' the gunman put into the attack, Rita Katz, director of SITE, said.\n\nForensic officers were working at the site where one of the victims was shot outside a synagogue on Wednesday\n\nA bus whose destination board reads 'evacuation' is escorted by police past the site of a shooting in Halle on Wednesday\n\nArmed police block access to a street near the scene of a shooting that has left two people dead\n\nJewish worshippers were sealed inside the synagogue for several hours while police cleared the surrounding area, before finally being allowed out.

The 35-minute video was streamed live on Twitch, an Amazon-owned gaming site, and stayed there for another 30 minutes after the broadcast had finished before it was finally taken down. In that time more than 2,000 people viewed the footage and some of them distributed it further via other social media networks. The 35-minute video was streamed live on Twitch (file photo), an Amazon-owned gaming site, and stayed there for another 30 minutes after the broadcast had finished The shooter had created his Twitch account two months before Wednesday's Yom Kippur violence. Last night there were calls for social media sites to take action to stop their platforms being used for violence. 'Amazon is just as much to blame as Twitch for allowing this stream online,' said Hans-Jakob Schindler of the Counter Extremism Project. 'Online platforms need to step up and stop their services being used and in turn, parent companies need to hold them accountable. 'This tragic incident demonstrates one more time that a self-regulatory approach is not effective enough and sadly highlights the need for stronger regulation of the tech sector.' 'We are shocked and saddened by the tragedy that took place in Germany, and our deepest condolences go out to all those affected,' a Twitch spokesman said. 'Twitch has a zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct, and any act of violence is taken extremely seriously. 'We worked with urgency to remove this content and will permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act. 'Once the video was removed, we shared the hash with an industry consortium to help prevent the proliferation of this content. 'We take this extremely seriously and are committed to working with industry peers, law enforcement, and any relevant parties to protect our community.'\n\nGerman newspaper Die Welt reported that the text, which is about 10 pages long and written in English, specifically mentions the plan to attack the synagogue in Halle during Yom Kippur.\n\nThe rampage was streamed live for 35 minutes on Twitch, and eventually seen by some 2,200 people, the online platform said.\n\nPolice subsequently captured a suspect after a gun battle that left the man injured, though they have refused to say whether the man they captured is the same one seen online.\n\nIt is thought that Balliet tried and failed to get into the Halle synagogue where around 80 people were praying, before shooting through the doors, throwing explosives, and then laying bombs outside.\n\nHe then gunned down a woman in the street before driving around the corner to a kebab shop where he again opened fire, killing a man and wounding several others.\n\nVideo taken outside the shop shows a man wearing tactical gear and a helmet with a camera strapped to it climbing out of a car and firing several shots into the street with what appears to be an improvised shotgun.\n\nHe then walks up and down the road in full view of security cameras before fleeing in the direction of Wiedersdorf.\n\nAfter arriving in that village he shot an electrician in a workshop, then stole a taxi and made his way on to the A9 motorway, skirting around the city of Leipzig, before turning on to the B91 towards Zeitz.\n\nIt was there that he was confronted by police and arrested after a brief gun battle, Bild reports.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel joined a solidarity vigil at Berlin's main synagogue on Wednesday, and firmly condemned the anti-Semitic rampage.\n\nBut Jewish leaders said that words were not enough, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joining calls for German authorities to 'act resolutely against the phenomenon of anti-Semitism'.\n\nThe head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany ripped into the authorities for failing to provide adequate security on such a key day.\n\n'It is scandalous that the synagogue in Halle is not protected by police on a holiday like Yom Kippur,' said Josef Schuster.\n\n'This negligence has now been bitterly repaid.'\n\nRonald Lauder, who heads the World Jewish Congress, also stressed: 'We need action not words' as he called for round the clock security for Jewish sites.\n\n'We also need immediately to launch a unified front against neo-Nazi and other extremist groups, which threaten our well-being.\n\n'The fact that, 75 years after the Holocaust, such groups are gaining influence in Germany speaks volumes.'\n\nIn a copy of a 35-minute video obtained by AFP the gunman filmed himself launching into a diatribe against women and Jews, before carrying out the attack.\n\nThe video's authenticity has been confirmed by the SITE monitoring group but not by police.\n\nRescued members of the Jewish community wait inside a bus near the scene of a shooting that has left two people dead\n\nPolice initially advised residents to shelter in their homes while they scoured the area for possible further attackers\n\nPolice officers with an armoured vehicle block a road in Halle, Germany\n\nA helicopter takes off as police secure the area between Wiedersdorf and Landsberg near Halle, eastern Germany\n\nAn officer leads a bomb-sniffing dog across the street in Halle, following reports that grenades were thrown by a gunman who targeted a synagogue in the city\n\nA helicopter lands as police secure the area between Wiedersdorf and Landsberg near Halle, eastern Germany.

He then tried unsuccessfully to blast open the gate of the Jewish cemetery with explosives.\n\nThe man was later seen shooting at a patron of a kebab shop about 600 metres (yards) away from the synagogue.\n\nJewish community leader Max Privorotzki, who was in the Halle synagogue, told the Stuttgarter Zeitung of the harrowing minutes as the site came under assault.\n\n'We saw through the camera of our synagogue that a heavily armed perpetrator wearing a steel helmet and rifle was trying to shoot open our door.'\n\nBetween 70 and 80 people were in the synagogue then, Privorotzki said.\n\n'We barricaded our doors from inside and waited for the police,' he said, adding that 'in between, we carried on with our service.'\n\nArmed officers help a woman to cross the street, stepping around shell casings which have been circled with spray paint on the floor\n\nPolice block the area around the site of a shooting in Halle an der Saale, eastern Germany\n\nPolice say they have arrested one person in connection with the attack, but told resident to shelter in place while the manhunt continues (pictured, an ambulance at the scene\n\nPolice secure the area after a shooting in the eastern German city of Halle\n\nAmong those in the synagogue were 10 Americans, as well as several Israelis, who had turned up in Halle especially to join the small local population in celebrating Yom Kippur.\n\n'We've made it out with our lives, in health and amazing spirits,' wrote Rebecca Blady, a Jewish American community leader, who was in the synagogue.\n\nYom Kippur - Judaism's holiest day Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day in Judaism which is marked with an intensive 25-hour period of fasting and prayer. The holiday began Tuesday night and was due to end late Wednesday. The day typically involves five prayer sessions, with followers encouraged to repent for sins. It is celebrated throughout the Jewish world, even by typically secular members of the faith.\n\nThe owner of the kebab shop, Rifat Tekin, meanwhile described the gunman as 'calm like a professional'.\n\n'Maybe he has done this many times. Like me making a kebab, he's doing this - like a professional.'\n\nAnti-terrorist prosecutors confirmed that they were taking over the probe given 'the particular importance of the case' which involved 'violent acts that affect the domestic security of the Federal Republic of Germany'.\n\nWednesday's shootings came three months after the shocking assassination-style murder of local pro-migrant politician Walter Luebcke in the western city of Kassel, allegedly by a known neo-Nazi.\n\nLuebcke's killing has deeply shaken Germany, raising questions about whether it has failed to take seriously a rising threat from right-wing extremists.\n\nInvestigators have been probing the extent of suspect Stephan Ernst's neo-Nazi ties and whether he had links to the far-right militant cell National Socialist Underground (NSU).\n\nInterior Minister Horst Seehofer last month warned of the rising danger of the militant far right, calling it 'as big a threat as radical Islamism'.\n\nA police officer stands guard next to a van close to which his colleagues are gathered near the site of the shooting in Halle\n\nA police robot near the scene of a shooting that has left two people dead in Halle, Germany\n\nPolice forces walk along the wall to a Jewish cemetery near the scene of a shooting that has left two people dead in Halle\n\nArmed officers were also deployed outside a synagogue in Dresden, around 90 miles from Halle, as a precautionary measure following the attack amid fears of copy-cats\n\nPolice officers secure a synagogue in Dresden, Germany, following a shooting 90 miles away in Halle", "description": "Stephan Balliet, 27 - identified as the German Yom Kippur shooter after live-streaming the attack online - has been revealed as a loner who lived with his mother and spent hours on his computer.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance", "Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/21/19509228-0-image-a-28_1570651572345.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
