The council is formed of 87 members from across the Nordic countries, including Greta\u2019s home nation of Sweden.\n\n\u201cI have decided to decline this prize,\u201d the 16-year-old wrote in a lengthy post on Instagram.\n\nShe thanked the council for the \u201chonour\u201d but was critical about the concept of climate prizes.\n\nThe schoolgirl also said Nordic countries \u201cbragged\u201d about their success in combating climate change and criticised their environmental policies, saying they \u201cbasically did nothing\u201d to help the cause.\n\n\u201cThe climate movement does not need any more awards,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is for our politicians and the people in power start to listen to the current, best available science.\n\n\u201cThe Nordic countries have a great reputation around the world when it comes to climate and environmental issues. There is no lack of bragging about this. There is no lack of beautiful words.\n\n\u201cBut when it comes to our actual emissions and our ecological footprints per capita \u2013 if we include our consumption, our imports as well as aviation and shipping \u2013 then it\u2019s a whole other story.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish schoolgirl began a lone climate change protest in October 2018 outside the country\u2019s parliament.\n\nShe said she would refuse to attend school on Fridays until the Swedish government dealt with the intensifying ecological crisis.\n\nGreta\u2019s actions have sparked a global protest movement. Inspired by her, schoolchildren have walked out of their classrooms in a series of Friday protests.\n\nThe 16-year-old has also spoken in front of world leaders at the UN general assembly and Davos and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, which was won by Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed.\n\n\u201cIn Sweden we live as if we had about 4 planets according to WWF and Global Footprint Network. And roughly the same goes for the entire Nordic region,\u201d the teenager said in her Instagram post.\n\n\u201cSo until you start to act in accordance with what the science says is needed to limit the global temperature rise below 1,5 degrees or even 2 degrees celsius, I \u2013 and Fridays For Future in Sweden \u2013 choose not to accept the Nordic Councils environmental award.\u201d", "description": "Greta Thunberg has turned down an environmental prize worth 500,000 Swedish kronor (\u00a340,000).The teenage climate activist won the Nordic Council\u2019s environmental award for 2019.
