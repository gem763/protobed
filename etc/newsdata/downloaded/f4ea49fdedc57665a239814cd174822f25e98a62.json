If not the UK will leave with no deal.\"\n\nUnder the Benn Act, passed last month, the prime minister must write to the EU requesting a Brexit extension if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October, unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nGovernment papers submitted to a Scottish court said that Mr Johnson will comply, despite his assertion that there will be \"no more dither or delay\".\n\nThe No 10 source called the legislation a \"surrender act\" and said its authors were \"undermining negotiations\".\n\n\"If EU leaders are betting that it will prevent no deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding,\" they said.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Iain Watson, political correspondent\n\nIt's good to talk.\n\nBut was there a meeting of minds between the prime minister and the French president?\n\nBoris Johnson's aim was to disavow President Macron of any suspicion that parliament simply wouldn't allow the UK to leave the EU at the end of the month without a deal.\n\nSo this really could be the 'final opportunity' to seal one.\n\nThe prime minister will deliver a similar message to other EU leaders.\n\nSo far, though, Mr Johnson's proposals are yet to open the door to more intensive negotiations.\n\nFrom the Elysee Palace's account of the call, Macron's message to the PM seemed to be: First, work through the EU negotiator, Michel Barnier - don't work on individual leaders.\n\nAnd second, if you don't move a bit more towards the EU's position by the end of the week, then it's no deal.\n\nSo far, then, any talks seem to resemble the denouement of Reservoir Dogs - more stand-off than mutual understanding.\n\nMr Johnson has claimed his plans have gained support in Parliament.\n\nWriting in the Sun on Sunday and the Sunday Express, he said his untested plan to use technology to eliminate customs border checks would take the UK out of EU trade rules while respecting the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\n\"I say to our European friends: grasp the opportunity our new proposal provides. Join us at the negotiating table in a spirit of compromise and co-operation,\" he said.\n\nHe claimed MPs from \"every wing of the Conservative Party\", Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and from Labour have said \"our proposed deal looks like one they can get behind\".\n\nEarlier, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he believed a deal was possible but said the current proposals could not yet \"form the basis for deeper negotiations\".\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said talks were under way with Labour and other opposition MPs aimed at securing their support for a new deal.\n\nHe said ministers were \"considering\" the idea of putting the PM's proposals to a vote in Parliament to test support for them ahead of the EU summit.\n\nWhat are the PM's border plans?\n\nUnder Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a \"broad landing zone\" for a new deal with the EU:\n\nNorthern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021\n\nBut Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves\n\nThis arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years\n\nCustoms checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be \"decentralised\", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a \"very small number\" of physical checks\n\nThese checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at \"other points in the supply chain\"\n\nAlso on the Andrew Marr show, Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti said the prime minister \"speaks with forked tongue\" on the possibility of asking for an extension, adding he \"seems to think he is above the law\".\n\nShe insisted there were no loopholes in the legislation, adding that the conditions under which the PM must ask for another Brexit delay were \"explicit and specific\".", "description": "The EU will evaluate then whether a deal is possible, the French president tells Boris Johnson.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1038A/production/_109124466_hi055969315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
