No flag was thrown.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the situation, NFL senior V.P. of officiating Al Riveron looked at the play but decided not to conduct a full-blown replay review.\n\nRiveron previously explained in an appearance on the #PFTPM podcast that replay review in Hail Mary situations will entail the same relaxed standard that applies on the field when a team launches a wing and a prayer.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, everyone understands what\u2019s allowed, what\u2019s not allowed on a Hail Mary,\u201d Riveron said regarding an unofficial exception to pass interference that appears nowhere in the rulebook. \u201cIt\u2019s probably fortunate that we\u2019re not putting this play into a box because it\u2019s something when we see it, and when I say \u2018we\u2019 I mean the football community from fans to coaches to players to officials, we\u2019ll all agree that that\u2019s a Hail Mary and we\u2019ll understand what\u2019s allowable and what\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nSome would say that an apparent shove to the ground of a receiver who may have had a shot at making the catch would justify at least a closer look at whether the shove happened deliberately or incidentally.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the play had been reviewed and overturned, the officials would have had to bring both teams out of the locker room for an untimed down from inside the Kansas City five yard line. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce told PFT by phone after the game that he wouldn\u2019t have been surprised by such an outcome, given the crazy, unpredictable way that the game unfolded.", "description": "The last play of the Chiefs-Lions game included an attempt by Detroit to do what Green Bay did in that same building four years ago.
