He told his New York audience that throngs of young activists are ready to save rain forests \u2014 and the planet \u2014 if world leaders would \u201cget the hell out of their way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about saving the Amazon for 30 years,\u201d Mr. Ford said Monday in footage shared by Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019re still talking about it. The world\u2019s largest rain forest, the Amazon is crucial to any climate change solution for its capacity to sequester carbon, for its biodiversity, for its freshwater, for the air we breathe, for our morality. And it is on fire. When a room in your house is on fire, you don\u2019t say, \u2018There is a fire in a room in my house.\u2019 You say, \u2018My house is on fire,\u2019 and we only have one house.\u201d\n\nThe actor then touted a \u201cmoral army\u201d that can succeed where others have failed.\n\n\u201cThey are the young people who, frankly, we have failed \u2014 who are angry, who are organized, who are capable of making a difference,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cThe most important thing that we can do for them is to get the hell out of their way.\u201d\n\nCritics on Twitter called the actor, who is also a licensed pilot, a hypocrite.\n\nSome reactions include:\n\n\u201cHarrison Ford has an aviation hobby and he owns airplanes. Ford\u2019s carbon footprint is multiples of the average person\u2019s carbon footprint around the world. What would the world look like if everyone lived Ford\u2019s lifestyle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope he didn\u2019t forget to turn off his private jet\u2019s engine after parking it at the hangar.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarrison Ford owns EIGHT (8) planes, among them the Cessna 680 Sovereign, a long-range jet. He\u2019s a qualified pilot. \u2018[I] used to own airplanes and have pilots flying them for me, but I finally realized they were having more fun than I was.\u2019 We want his life!\u201d\n\nThe social media aggregator Twitchy also covered an extended list of feedback and labeled the actor the \u201cHypocrite of the Day.\u201d\n\nActor Harrison Ford spoke at the United Nations to demand immediate action on climate change, warning that the future of the planet is at stake pic.twitter.com/QwSGlaPuDS \u2014 Reuters Top News (@Reuters) September 23, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
