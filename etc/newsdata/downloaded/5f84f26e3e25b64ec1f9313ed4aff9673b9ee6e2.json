The Republic and USA TODAY analyzed fire hazards across 760 million acres of the American West and found that more than 500 small communities face a wildfire potential greater than in Paradise, California, where the Camp Fire left 85 people dead and nearly 19,000 buildings destroyed. \u201cAhead of the Fire\u201d allows users to personalize the data by looking up specific communities that are relevant to them.\n\nThe Republic and USA Today first analyzed U.S. Forest Service data of wildfire hazard potential (WHP) and then paired the data with more than 5,000 Census-designated places. Data reporters also examined other factors that raise risk beyond the initial wildfire hazard potential, such as evacuation constraints, age, disabilities, alerting systems and mobile homes.\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK newsrooms across eight states worked together on the reporting for \u201cAhead of the Fire.\u201d The interactive project includes an interactive map illustrating potential fire hazards, a data explorer, informational graphics, audio of 911 phone calls, photographs and stories profiling some of the highest risk towns in the West. The project received record interaction for the USA TODAY NETWORK.\n\n\u201cI am so proud of the work done by journalists, data reporters, graphics and visual teams, and many others across the USA TODAY NETWORK to give people the tools they need to become more aware of wildfire risks and hopefully help prevent the next wildfire disaster,\u201d said Greg Burton, executive editor of The Arizona Republic.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/08/16/arizona-republic-and-usa-today-publish-major-data-analysis-wildfire-risks/2029833001/", "description": "Interactive project \u201cAhead of the Fire\u201d helps people understand wildfires risks for thousands of communities in Western states.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
