This comes after determining that it failed to adequately respond to sexual assault complaints against Larry Nassar, a former campus sports doctor who molested elite gymnasts and other female athletes.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos announced the penalty after the conclusion of two federal investigations. She said Nassar's actions were \"disgusting and unimaginable\" and that the university's response fit the same description.\n\n\"Too many people in power knew about the behaviors and the complaints and yet the predators continued on the payroll and abused even more students,\" DeVos said in a call with reporters. \"This must not happen again, there or anywhere else.\"\n\nThe fine is the largest levied under the Clery Act, a federal law that requires colleges to collect data on campus crime and notify students of threats. The previous largest fine, $2.4 million, was imposed in 2016 against Pennsylvania State University over its handling of sexual misconduct involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.\n\nThe department's investigation concluded that Michigan State violated several key parts of the Clery Act along with Title IX, a federal law forbidding discrimination based on gender in education.\n\nIn response, the school announced the resignation of its chief academic officer, Provost June Youatt.\n\nFormer Michigan State University Provost June Pierce Youatt seen June 18, 2015. AP\n\nPresident Samuel Stanley Jr. said his predecessor, Lou Anna Simon, and Youatt \"failed to take appropriate action,\" especially with regard to William Strampel, a medical school dean and Nassar's boss, who faced his own harassment allegations.\n\n\"In my effort to build a safe and caring campus, we must have a culture of accountability,\" said Stanley, who took office August 1.\n\nThe government's investigation found Michigan State violated law by failing to disclose crime statistics, failing to issue campus warnings about security threats and failing to establish a system to collect crime statistics. As a remedy, the school says it will hire a Clery compliance officer and create measures to protect athletes and children who participate in youth programs on campus.\n\nA separate Title IX investigation found that Michigan State failed to respond to reports of sexual misconduct against Strampel and Nassar, failed to take interim measures to protect students while complaints against both men were pending, and failed to take steps to end any harassment and prevent it from recurring.\n\nAs part of its settlement agreement with the department, Michigan State says it will make \"substantial\" changes to its Title IX procedures and will provide a process to help victims of Nassar, including offering counseling services, grade changes, tuition reimbursement or the opportunity to retake classes at no cost.\n\nThe school is also being ordered to consider sanctions against current and former employees who failed to take action after being notified of sexual misconduct by Nassar and Strampel.\n\nKenneth Marcus, the department's assistant secretary for civil rights, said the agreement represents an \"extensive and robust\" resolution. Unlike most Title IX investigations, which are usually triggered by complaints submitted to the department, Marcus' office launched an investigation into Michigan State in 2018 based on the severity of the allegations, he said.\n\n\"This message should be heard loudly and clearly by all universities so that the tragedy at Michigan State University is not repeated elsewhere,\" Marcus said.\n\nEx-USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny \"tried to silence everyone\" in Nassar abuse case, former athlete says\n\nNassar was sentenced to decades in prison for sexually assaulting athletes, mostly female gymnasts, at Michigan State and a Lansing-area gymnastics club. Former Olympians said he also molested them in Texas and overseas while he worked for USA Gymnastics.\n\nMSU last year agreed to a $500 million deal with Nassar's accusers. Most of the money, $425 million, was for 333 people, mostly women and girls, who had already sued. MSU so far has settled with 72 people in the second wave of litigation, but dozens remain.\n\nStrampel last month was sentenced to a year in jail for neglect of duty and misconduct in office. He was accused of failing to monitor Nassar and of sexually harassing students.", "description": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced the penalty and said Larry Nassar's actions and university's response were \"disgusting and unimaginable\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/05/1c3d4866-1aec-4eda-8553-75e17daf903c/thumbnail/1200x630/fbc96fb95293852e41d42b5c09a8b55b/gettyimages-914540502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
