I\u2019m not going to turn the Senate into a circus.\"\n\nWhat to watch: The resolution could force some vulnerable Senate Republicans who have wavered on impeachment and Trump's calls for foreign powers to investigate his political opponents to go on the record.\n\nRead the resolution\n\nGo deeper: How an impeachment inquiry works", "description": "Influential figures in the Trump base, including Donald Trump Jr., have pressured Graham to take more action.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Ebw05q-rAk-BrmigangUdSIWQIY=/136x221:4128x2466/1920x1080/2019/10/24/1571945724723.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
