But it turns out that in Brazil, there are hundreds.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Boca Juniors' captain Juan Roman Riquelme and teammate Clemente Rodriguez (L) celebrate at the end of their Argentine First Division soccer match against Banfield in Buenos Aires, December 4, 2011. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci/File Photo\n\nBrazil and Argentina may be sporting rivals but Vasco da Gama have a 17-year-old left back called Riquelme Viana, while Corinthians recently signed 17-year-old holding midfielder Riquelme Rodrigues Mendes on a three-year contract.\n\nOne of the teenage players killed in the fire at Flamengo\u2019s training base earlier this year was named Rykelmo de Souza Viana.\n\nA search carried out for Reuters by the Brazilian Football Confederation produced 110 player registrations under the name Riquelme and another 41 named Rikelme. There are many more with creative spellings, including Riquelmo and Rykelme.\n\nThe passion for Juan Roman is particularly evident at Cruzeiro, where four members of the youth team are named after the Argentine playmaker \u2013 Riquelme, Riquelmo, Rikelme and Riquelmy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, sometimes you get whole generations who are named after a player or an actor; we once had six players named after Caua, a TV Globo soap opera star,\u201d Alexandre Grasseli, Cruzeiro\u2019s Under-17 coach, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s happened here with the Argentine player and it has really made communications complicated. We had to find a way round it. So we decided to give them all different nicknames.\u201d\n\nIt is not uncommon for parents to name their sons after footballing greats.\n\nBrazil is filled with Edsons (named after Pele\u2019s given name Edson Arantes do Nascimento) and Arthurs (named after Zico\u2019s birth name Arthur Antunes Coimbra).\n\nBut there is something peculiar about Brazilians naming their offspring after someone who played for their greatest rivals, a man famous for his lack of charisma, and for never winning a major title with the national side.\n\nOne of the explanations is in the timing. Most of the namesakes were born in the early part of this century, when Riquelme was at the helm of a Boca Juniors dynasty, helping them to Copa Libertadores titles in 2000, 2001 and 2007.\n\nTellingly, each year they beat a Brazilian side in the semi or the final.\n\n\u201cThey chose my name when Riquelme did over Palmeiras in the Libertadores,\u201d one of the Cruzeiro players told O Globo. \u201cMy dad supports (Palmeiras\u2019 arch rivals) Corinthians so that explains it.\u201d\n\nAnother explanation is more satisfying; Brazilians see the elegant schemer as one of their own.\n\n\u201cRiquelme played attractive football, just like a Brazilian, with creativity, talent and intelligence,\u201d said Grasseli. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t quite a Messi or even a Neymar but was the symbol of an era.\u201d", "description": "In Argentina, there will always be only one Juan Roman Riquelme who thrilled a generation of football fans with his grace and swagger.
