There is nothing \u201cracist\u201d or \u201cimmoral\u201d about this requirement at all.\n\nOn Aug. 14, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published its new rule on how it will determine if \u201can alien applying for admission or adjustment of status is inadmissible \u2026 because he or she is likely at any time to become a public charge.\u201d Being a \u201cpublic charge\u201d means that an individual is unable to support himself and instead relies on public benefits such as welfare. This is a long-standing principle of U.S. immigration law, first implemented at the federal level in 1882.\n\nIt is common sense \u2014 and a smart choice in the best interests of the country as a whole \u2014 to try to ensure that new, legal immigrants to our country are self-sufficient individuals who will be a net plus for our economy, rather than a drag on expensive medical, housing, welfare, and other public assistance programs paid for by the American taxpayer at both the state and federal level.\n\nThese programs are a major source of our trillion-dollar budget deficits and the increase in our public debt. Why would we want to bring in immigrants who will only add to that deficit and that debt?\n\nThe statute does not define \u201cpublic charge,\" but leaves that up to the federal government. Congress articulated our immigration policy that \u201caliens within the Nation\u2019s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and private organizations.\u201d This is intended to prevent damage to the economy and increased public debt, of course, but also to ensure that \u201cthe availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.\u201d\n\nIn the past, federal rules focused only on \u201cthe receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term care at Government expense.\u201d This definition essentially ignored the numerous other costly public benefits the government provides. Thus, if an alien was receiving non-cash benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and food stamp programs; Medicaid; and housing vouchers and subsidies, he was not considered a \u201cpublic charge\u201d on the taxpayer.\n\nThe administration\u2019s new rules simply define the public charge requirement to reflect today\u2019s system of government benefits. In other words, it brings reality into the system.\n\nIn short, the rule insists that to become a permanent resident in the U.S. with eventual access to U.S. citizenship; to be admitted as a legal immigrant on a visa; or to change your status and extend your stay or apply for citizenship when you are already legally in the country, an individual must not be reliant on, or likely to become reliant on, such welfare programs.\n\nThere are numerous exceptions in the new rule. For example, it does not apply to humanitarian-based immigration programs. This ensures that refugees, asylum seekers, victims of sex-trafficking, or other special cases such as victims of qualifying criminal activity (including domestic violence) won\u2019t be barred by the public charge requirement.\n\nIt does not apply to aliens who serve in the U.S. military or to pregnant women and aliens under the age of 21 who receive Medicaid benefits. It also won\u2019t apply to Medicaid benefits paid for emergency medical or school-based services (such as provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act).\n\nAdditionally, if DHS decides that an immigrant is not admissible because of the public charge rule, in limited circumstances, DHS will offer the aliens the opportunity to post a public bond. The amount of the bond will vary depending on the alien\u2019s circumstances.\n\nThis rule protects U.S. taxpayers by ensuring that new immigrants to the U.S. will not add even more spending to the welfare and entitlement programs already driving American debt to unsustainable levels.\n\nIt also ensures that the U.S. is granting entry to those who are self-reliant, rewarding such industrious immigrants with the privilege of staying and working in the U.S. and eventually gaining access to the most prized possession of all \u2013 American citizenship.", "description": "The latest claims against the Trump administration over its enforcement of the \u201cpublic charge\u201d provision in federal immigration law are nonsensical.
