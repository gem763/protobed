We had hope for the future.\"\n\nMr Bithell has been battling with an incurable stage four cancer, mantle cell lymphoma, since being diagnosed in December last year.\n\nThe 55-year-old is undergoing chemotherapy treatment with the hope to extend his life by up to a decade, but says it's possible he could only have another two years to live.\n\nPaying tribute to his wife, he added: \"She was really lovely. She was liked by everyone, very popular. She was very fit and active and a fantastic mum to Harry.\n\n\"At work, she was like a mother figure to a lot of people that worked there.\n\n\"Aneurysms just come on really quickly, it can just happen like that - and it did - it just happened out the blue.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail WS)\n\n\"We can't believe it's happened, I'm up and down like a yo-yo, one minute I'm alright, the next I'm in floods of tears. It's like a bad dream. It's the last thing we expected.\n\n\"Sharon was going to be the breadwinner when I was going through all my treatment, so we just didn't have any indication of this happening.\"\n\nHe described Sharon as being \"fit as a flea\".\n\nShe was airlifted to the hospital in Southampton after locals near their home saved her life with CPR.\n\n\"The people here are well-trained in first aid and were told that they saved her life by doing CPR and mouth to mouth,\" he said.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail WS)\n\n\"The staff at the hospital said she wouldn't have survived if they hadn't have intervened.\n\n\"It was Sunday she went in and really we knew on the Wednesday that she wasn't going to survive, ten days later.\"\n\nHe cannot work while undergoing his cancer treatment, due to finish in July next year, so his parents and Sharon's parents have moved into the area to support them.\n\nA GoFundMe appeal, which has smashed its \u00a37,000 target, has also been launched in a desperate bid to raise funds for the family.\n\nDave added: \"[The cancer] is incurable so. At some point, I might go into remission.\n\n\"One of the consultants said to me: 'If you had this five years ago your chances of survival would be poor, but now its quite likely that we can give you another five years'.\n\n\"Maybe I might get ten years, I might get five - I might get two, we just don't know.\"", "description": "Sharon Bithell leaves behind son Harry and husband Dave, who is battling an incurable disease", "authors": ["Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Birmingham Mail Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748719.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RIP-Fit-and-healthy-mum-of-one-dies-suddenly-while-husband-battling-incurable-cancer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
