Terrified that her daughter will become one of China's so-called \"leftover women,\" or an urban woman who isn't married, a mother secretly sets up an online dating profile to find her daughter a husband. We look at why the Chinese government has been stoking the anxieties of single women, and how the Chinese podcast manages to broach this topic.\n\nThen, we broadcast an episode of Israel Story, about a journalist Danna Harman who wants to become a mother, when her life is altered after an encounter with a young girl in Kathmandu. Listen to hear about how the search for love can sometimes make you a stranger, to yourself.\n\nFurther listening:\n\nHere are the Gushi FM episodes we mentioned:\n\nShare your favorite international podcasts with us.
