Perhaps whatever your news outlet is, just think about people's feelings, just chill.\"\n\nTold his position was of great interest to the Australian public, Cheika replied: \"When the time comes, I'll tell them. They don't need to know today.\"\n\nThis result meant the Wallaby boss has presided over seven straight losses to England since his former team-mate at Sydney club Randwick, Eddie Jones, took charge of the Red Rose brigade after the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\"Exit is an exit, it doesn't matter if it's a final or quarter-final,\" said Cheika.\n\n\"The opponent is irrelevant. For all the carry-on (exchanges between Cheika and Jones), we are just going out to compete... it's painful either way.\"\n\n\"I feel that weight that I should have delivered for them (Australia fans).\"\n\nEngland outscored Australia four tries to one, with wing Jonny May marking his 50th cap with a first-half double in three minutes.\n\nProp Kyle Sinckler crossed for the first time in Test rugby before Anthony Watson went over four minutes from the finish.\n\nEngland captain Owen Farrell was faultless from the kicking tee, landing eight out of eight shots for a match haul of 20 points.\n\nYet Australia, thanks to a converted try from wing Marika Koroibete were only a point behind at 17-16 early in the second half.\n\nThe Wallabies gave away two intercept tries but Cheika insisted that playing a tighter game was \"not the Australian way\".\n\n\"I'm not going to go to a kick-and-defend game. Call me naive but that's not the way we want to play.\"\n\nMeanwhile Jones, Australia's coach when they lost the 2003 World Cup final to England, was asked if he felt any sympathy for Cheika.\n\n\"It's tough when you lose a game, particularly at this level,\" he said.\n\n\"But not a lot of sympathy now because I'm enjoying the win and I think I'm allowed to enjoy the win.\"", "description": "Dejected Australia coach Michael Cheika urged the media to show \"compassion\" when asked about his future on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8966/b07bd240358443ada88ef3ad15adc07e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
