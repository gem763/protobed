Junior Stephen Carr did not practice Monday after sustaining a hamstring strain in the same game. Redshirt junior Vavae Malepeai remains out after undergoing knee surgery last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never lost three backs in one week in 25 years before, but you know what, there\u2019s a first time for everything,\u201d Helton said.\n\nThose injuries allowed Christon to come in and shred a tired, demoralized Arizona defense for 103 yards on eight carries. His two touchdown runs showcased speed not seen in the Coliseum since Reggie Bush or Joe McKnight starred for the Trojans a decade earlier, with Christon coming off left tackle into the open field and hitting top speed in nearly identical fashion on both plays.\n\nArizona safety Christian Young looked to have an angle on Christon during the 55-yard run but couldn\u2019t close on the 2019 California high school 100-meters champion in time. That is exactly what offensive coordinator Graham Harrell wanted to happen, though he couldn\u2019t express his satisfaction in the play in real time.\n\n\u201cBut we couldn\u2019t get much in because (running backs coach Mike) Jinks was yelling over the headset and no one could say anything,\u201d Harrell said.\n\nHowever, Harrell has seen the 5-foot-10, 181-pound Christon do more than get out to the perimeter.\n\n\u201cObviously he\u2019s fast and special with the ball, but what I didn\u2019t know coming in was how physical he\u2019d be and how tough he\u2019d be and if he wanted to run between those tackles,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cGetting as many reps as he has inside this year, he\u2019s shown that a lot, and that\u2019s been good to see. And then he\u2019s also a kid that has shown to be physical in pass protection.\u201d\n\nIt turns out the development of such a well-rounded game goes back to when Christon started playing football in sixth grade. His coaches wanted to use the elusive Christon at wide receiver, but his struggles to catch the ball led him to play running back instead.\n\n\u201cThey just thought, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s fast, so we\u2019ll just hand him the ball and let him run outside,\u2019\u201d Christon said.\n\nA relative newcomer to the sport, Christon doesn\u2019t compare himself to or model his game after memorable speedsters from recent years such as Bush, Percy Harvin of Florida or De\u2019Anthony Thomas of Oregon. Instead, Christon likens himself to Walter Payton because of his father\u2019s fondness for the legendary Chicago Bears running back.\n\nJinks doesn\u2019t think Christon would have been ready for the physical toll of the heavy workloads Payton had during his heyday if the freshman had to be the feature back over an entire 12-game regular season. But that will be less of a concern more than halfway into Christon\u2019s first year of college football.\n\n\u201cFive, six, eight games, whatever it might be until we get some of those guys back, he\u2019ll be able to handle it,\u201d Jinks said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give him all he can handle.\u201d\n\nThe other two scholarship rushers behind Christon are former walk-on Quincy Jountti and Dominic Davis, a redshirt senior who was moved back to offense after playing cornerback.\n\nEven with those unproven options at running back, Harrell needs balance to make the game easier on freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis as USC tries to win the Pac-12 South.\n\n\u201cAs a quarterback, it\u2019s hard to be on every night,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cI mean, at any position, it\u2019s hard, but when you\u2019re the quarterback everyone sees it a lot more. . If you ever have a night where the quarterback is struggling a little bit, you can help him settle in and you can take some pressure off of him if you can run the football successfully.\u201d\n\nChriston said he is up to the challenge, and Jinks knows pure speed can make up for inexperience.\n\n\u201cYou know he\u2019s going to eat up some angles and there are going to be some explosive plays, so you got to take the good with the bad,\u201d Jinks said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Southern California running back Kenan Christon showed he can provide big plays, scoring on touchdowns runs of 55 and 30 yards in a memorable debut against Arizona.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Greenspan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/arizona_usc_football_81498_c0-107-2589-1617_s1200x700.jpg?1d22f78510da626ae3c122e40b3fc11dcbdc44f0", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
