Globally, under-5 deaths were 39 per 1,000 live births in 2017, according to the U.N.\n\nThe targets also include ensuring that all children receive a quality primary and secondary education.\n\nOne-third of children live in places that won\u2019t meet that goal by 2050, according to the Goalkeepers report.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really converging the way that you would expect,\u201d said Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist who co-chairs the foundation with his wife, Melinda Gates, in an interview. At the current rate of improvement in child mortality rates, as well as educational attainment, at the end of the century there \u201cwill still be a dramatic level of inequality, super dramatic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shift is particularly alarming because population growth is higher in parts of the world that lag the most behind, Mr. Gates said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How can developing countries best combat growing inequality in health and education? Join the conversation below.\n\nHealth and education are key measures of human capital\u2014the best way for a country to unlock innovation and generate prosperity, the Gates Foundation says. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which it funds, analyzed both by geographical location to pinpoint where the divide is occurring. It examined progress in 17,144 \u201cdistricts\u201d or counties in 97 low- and middle-income countries.\n\nPeople in the vast majority of the developing world are healthier and better educated today than they were at the beginning of this century, the analysis found. In 2000, 59 countries had rates of under-5 mortality of 69 per 1,000 live births, the average at that time, according to the IHME analysis. Millions of young children were dying of pneumonia, measles and diarrheal diseases. Another 51 countries had an under-5 mortality rate of more than 25, the current SDG target for 2030.\n\nDeaths of children 5 and younger per 1,000 live births, by country 25 (U.N. goal) 69 (2000 avg.) 100 125 150 No data 2000 Niger: 227.5 (highest) Afghanistan: 132.6 (highest outside Africa) Deaths of children 5 and younger per 1,000 live births, by country 25 (U.N. goal) 69 (2000 avg.) 100 125 150 No data 2000 Niger: 227.5 (highest) Afghanistan: 132.6 (highest outside Africa) Deaths of children 5 and younger per 1,000 live births, by country 25 (U.N. goal) 69 (2000 avg.) 100 125 150 No data 2000 Niger: 227.5 (highest) Afghanistan: 132.6 (highest outside Africa) Deaths of children 5 and younger per 1,000 live births, by country 25 (U.N. goal) 69 (2000 avg.) 100 125 150 No data 2000 Niger: 227.5 (highest)\n\nBy 2017, only 20 countries had a rate above 70, the result of new efforts to vaccinate children against preventable diseases, and more effective prevention of illnesses such as malaria. The remaining countries were concentrated almost entirely in the Sahel region of Africa, a band that stretches across Africa below the Sahara Desert.\n\n2017 Sahel countries 2017 Sahel countries 2017 Sahel countries 2017 Sahel countries\n\nHealth and education improved in these countries between 2000 and 2017, as like many parts of the world.\n\nCountry progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one country in 2000 and 2017 Sahel country 0 BETTER Mauritania 50 Senegal Eritrea Sudan Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births Burkina Faso 100 Chad Nigeria Niger Mali 150 200 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds Country progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one country in 2000 and 2017 Sahel country 0 BETTER Mauritania 50 Senegal Eritrea Sudan Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births Burkina Faso 100 Chad Nigeria Niger Mali 150 200 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds Country progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one country in 2000 and 2017 Sahel country 0 BETTER Mauritania 50 Senegal Eritrea Sudan Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births Burkina Faso 100 Chad Nigeria Niger Mali 150 200 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds Country progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one country in 2000 and 2017 Sahel country 0 Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births BETTER Mauritania Eritrea 50 Senegal Sudan Burkina Faso 100 Nigeria Chad Niger 150 Mali 200 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds\n\nBut compared with the rest of the world, these countries are far behind. Literacy rates are low in the Sahel, and under-5 mortality is higher than anywhere else in the world. Yet its population is skyrocketing,\n\nThere are stark disparities within countries of the Sahel, the IHME district-level analysis shows. Mali and Nigeria are prime examples. Southeastern Mali is plagued with drought and desertification\u2014a slow expansion of the desert onto fertile lands. Northern Nigeria has been impoverished historically compared with the rest of the country, and attacks from Boko Haram, the group that aims to create an Islamic State in Nigeria, have created further instability.\n\nDeaths of children 5 and younger per 1,000 live births, by country districts 25 (U.N. goal) 69 100 125 150 No data 2017 MAURITANIA MALI NIGER SUDAN SEN.

Garki, a city in northern Nigeria, had one of the highest rates of under-5 mortality and lowest rates of educational attainment in 2000. It has improved, but that has only brought it up to the bottom of today\u2019s rankings. Oredo-Edo, a district in the south of the country, by contrast, has improved at a slower rate but is still at the top. Even today, disparities across Nigeria remain great.\n\nNigeria progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one district in 2000 and 2017 0 BETTER Oredo Edo (Lowest mortality, 2017) Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births 50 100 150 200 Garki (Highest) 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds Nigeria progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one district in 2000 and 2017 0 BETTER Oredo Edo (Lowest mortality, 2017) Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births 50 100 150 200 Garki (Highest) 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds Nigeria progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one district in 2000 and 2017 0 BETTER Oredo Edo (Lowest mortality, 2017) Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births 50 100 150 200 Garki (Highest) 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds Nigeria progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one district in 2000 and 2017 0 Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births Oredo Edo (Lowest mortality, 2017) BETTER 50 100 150 200 Garki (Highest) 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds\n\nBy contrast, Rwanda, a much smaller country whose government has invested significantly in education and health care, shows much more uniform improvement.\n\nRwanda progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one district in 2000 and 2017 0 BETTER Rubavu (Lowest mortality, 2017) Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births 50 Kayonza (Highest) 100 150 200 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds Rwanda progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one district in 2000 and 2017 0 BETTER Rubavu (Lowest mortality, 2017) Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births 50 Kayonza (Highest) 100 150 200 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds Rwanda progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one district in 2000 and 2017 0 BETTER Rubavu (Lowest mortality, 2017) Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births 50 Kayonza (Highest) 100 150 200 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds Rwanda progress on child mortality and education Each dot represents one district in 2000 and 2017 0 Rubavu (Lowest mortality, 2017) Under-five mortality rate (mean), expressed as deaths per 1,000 live births BETTER 50 Kayonza (Highest) 100 150 200 250 300 WORSE BETTER 350 0 5 10 15 Mean years of schooling, both sexes, 20-24 year olds\n\nNigeria is among the countries that are expected to remain above the 2030 target for under-5 mortality if progress doesn\u2019t accelerate before then, the data show.\n\nUnder-five mortality rates (deaths per 1,000 live births) Countries that met the goal in 2017 Countries projected to reach goal by 2030 Countries not expected to reach goal 125 Central African Republic 100 Mali 75 Nigeria 50 25 Goal 25 0 2017 Projected 2030 Countries that met the goal in 2017 Countries projected to reach goal by 2030 Countries not expected to reach goal 125 Central African Republic 100 Mali 75 Nigeria 50 25 Goal 25 0 2017 Projected 2030 Countries that met the goal in 2017 Countries projected to reach goal by 2030 Countries not expected to reach goal 125 Central African Republic 100 Mali 75 Nigeria 50 25 Goal 25 0 2017 Projected 2030 Countries that met the goal in 2017 Countries projected to reach goal by 2030 Countries not expected to reach goal 125 Central African Republic 100 Mali 75 Nigeria 50 25 Goal 25 0 2017 Projected 2030\n\nWrite to Betsy McKay at betsy.mckay@wsj.com and Max Rust at max.rust@dowjones.com", "description": "Nearly two-thirds of children in developing countries live in villages, cities or regions where deaths under 5 years of age aren\u2019t declining rapidly enough to meet United Nations goals, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Betsy Mckay", "Max Rust", "Roque Ruiz", "Josh Ulick", "Betsy.Mckay Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107529/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
