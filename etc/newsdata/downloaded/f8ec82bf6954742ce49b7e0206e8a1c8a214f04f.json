These cheap stocks will see you through, says Goldman", "language": "en", "text": "While the debate rages over whether the global economy is careening towards a recession, our call of the day from Goldman Sachs, suggests investors steer towards some reasonably-priced stocks that can see them through a downturn.\n\nStable growth stocks \u201cfare best in environments of slowing economic growth and rising uncertainty,\u201d say a team of Goldman analysts led by Ben Snider.\n\nOver the past two years, those companies with a history of growth stability have returned 22% vs. 16% for the S&P 500. That compares to a return of 1% for stocks with the most volatile historical earnings growth.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, volatile growth companies are currently growing earnings at a rate only marginally faster than stable growth companies, an unusual dynamic that further reduces their appeal to investors,\u201d said Snider and the team, in a note to clients.\n\nAs a reminder, growth stocks are those that tend to see faster-than-average earnings and revenue growth, but carry some risk. The popularity of these stocks has been ebbing lately as investors fret over the economy, trade, etc., favoring instead perceived safer-havens.\n\nGoldman says better news on the global economy would be a potential headwind for these equities, though that\u2019s offset by political uncertainty stemming from a 2020 U.S. presidential election. Another thing to consider is that these stocks have also grown in popularity, therefore they can command more of a premium.\n\nGoldman has picked through its basket of stable stocks to find those that they say are most reasonably priced. Such factors include shares that aren\u2019t too volatile, those with growth that\u2019s steady and a reasonable price earnings multiple \u2014 share price relative to per-share earnings.\n\nOn that list: financial services technology group Fiserv FISV, +2.07% , autoparts retailer Autozone AZO, -0.05% , software group Amdocs DOX, +1.34%, media group Omnicom OMC, -1.54%, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.61% and Walmart WMT, +0.16% .\n\nThe economy\n\nU.S. payroll data is dead ahead, along with the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings, and the foreign trade deficit at the same time. (Check out our preview)\n\nWe\u2019ll hear from lots of Federal Reserve officials Friday, with conferences in Boston and Washington. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will appear at the latter.\n\nThe market\n\nDow YM00, -0.30%, S&P ES00, -0.36% and Nasdaq NQ00, -0.30% futures are down. Oil US:CLV19 is up; gold GCZ19, -0.01% and the dollar DXY, -0.05% are stable.\n\nEurope stocks SXXP, +0.15% are struggling, and Asia ADOW, -0.10% was mixed. Hong Kong HSI, -1.11% stocks fell 1% on news of a ban on protestors\u2019 masks that some fear could trigger more unrest.\n\nRead: Court documents reportedly say Johnson will ask EU for Brexit delay if no deal reached\n\nThe chart\n\nOur chart of the day from Bank of America Merrill Lynch points out what it sees as a \u201cbig top\u201d , or peak, coming for the Dow industrials, which they see happening \u201cin coming quarters.\u201d\n\nThe buzz\n\nApple AAPL, +0.85% is up after a report that the company has asked suppliers to boost production owing to stronger demand for the iPhone 11.

The White House, meanwhile, reportedly plans to formally object to the Democrat\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nThe quote\n\nBloomberg News Just another billionaire?\n\n\u201cAt some level, no one deserves to have that much money.\u201d \u2014 That was Facebook FB, +2.74% CEO Mark Zuckerberg, telling employees what he thought about a recent comment from Sen.
