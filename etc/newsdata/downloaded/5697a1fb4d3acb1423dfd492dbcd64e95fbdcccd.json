(Photo: Dmitri Lovetsky, AP)\n\nMELBOURNE, Fla. \u2013 NASA will try once again to conduct an all-female spacewalk, six months after the first attempt had to be canceled because of a lack of available spacesuits aboard the International Space Station.\n\nChristina Koch and Jessica Meir are scheduled to embark on their spacewalk together on Oct. 21, the space agency announced Friday.\n\nOriginally, Koch was scheduled in March to conduct a spacewalk with astronaut Anne McClain \u2013 in what would have been the first all-female spacewalk. But McClain and Koch both required medium-size suits, and there was only one available that would be ready in time.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem anymore. NASA has sent up another medium-size spacesuit, according to NASA's news conference Friday.\n\nKoch, who has been at the space station since March, and Meir will conduct the fourth of five planned spacewalks to upgrade the power systems on the the space station by installing new lithium-ion batteries.\n\nHistory on hold: All-female spacewalk canceled because there weren't enough medium-sized spacesuits\n\nNot enough spacesuits in women's sizes?!: Twitter reacts to NASA canceling all-female spacewalk\n\n.@Astro_Christina and @Astro_Jessica are scheduled for a spacewalk together on Oct. 21. They recently talked about how their accomplishments are viewed in terms of being female astronauts. pic.twitter.com/yTJ0kVH40f \u2014 Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) October 4, 2019\n\nNASA\u2019s deputy chief astronaut Megan McArthur told reporters the all-female spacewalk will be a milestone. But she noted that women are so integrated at all levels at NASA now that they don\u2019t tend to dwell on gender.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll sit back and reflect on it, as we all will. We will all celebrate that,\u201d McArthur said.\n\nExpect more women spacewalking together on the horizon.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that over the next couple years, we\u2019re having a lot of medium-suit people fly,\u201d said NASA\u2019s space station program manager, Kirk Shireman.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow Antonia Jaramillo on Twitter:@AntoniaJ_11.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/04/nasa-once-again-attempt-first-all-female-iss-spacewalk/3870796002/", "description": "With two medium-size spacesuits now available, Christina Koch and Jessica Meir are scheduled to embark on their spacewalk Oct. 21, NASA said.", "authors": ["Antonia Jaramillo", "Published P.M.
