With its normal \u00a3610 price tag (ouch), grooming guru Braun has slashed the price of its Silk-expert Pro 5 PL5137 IPL by more than half, now available for just \u00a3274.99.\n\nOur IndyBest team has hand-picked this deal. We may earn some commission from the links in this article, but our selections have been made independently and without bias. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nThis 55 per cent discount makes this one of the most impressive beauty gadget deals of Amazon's Prime Day sale.\n\nAnd in even better news, here at IndyBest, we have reviewed similar products from Braun's Silk-expert Pro range, so we can confidently recommend investing in one.\n\nOur expert had this to say about Braun's Silk-Expert IPL BD 5009, a model from the same range, with similar features:\n\n\"We\u2019d recommend this IPL device for anyone with more sensitive skin. It has \u201cgentle\u201d and \u201cextra-gentle\u201d settings which we found were the most comfortable to use.\n\nIt\u2019s also the only device we tested that adapts the power setting to your skin tone as you use it, meaning you don\u2019t need to change things manually.\"\n\nIPL isn\u2019t a laser, but rather a spectrum of light and wavelengths that reduces hair growth gradually. Anyone using an IPL machine will find that there will be some regrowth, so areas would need to be redone, possibly every six to 12 months.\n\nBraun claim that their Pro 5 IPL is the \"safest, fastest and most efficient\" IPL, promising to banish hair permanently in just four weeks (we're impressed).\n\nThe discounted Silk-expert Pro 5 PL5137 IPL features SensoAdapt technology, which tailors the hair removal treatment to your skin type, continuously reading the skin tone to adapt the flash intensity for the safest and most effective results.\n\nThe precision head helps you tackle tricky areas, like the bikini line, or face, while the different modes help you target specific body parts, such as the stamp mode, for smaller, sensitive areas.\n\nIf you're looking looking to bag a bargain on this better-than-half-price IPL hair remover, then you better act fast, as the deal is only around for today \u2013 the last leg of Amazon's mammoth shopping event.\n\nFor more expert advice on IPL hair removers, read our review of the 8 best on the market.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
