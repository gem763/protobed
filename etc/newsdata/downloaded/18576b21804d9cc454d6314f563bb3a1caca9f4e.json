Last Tuesday, he posted a short video on his Facebook page, captioning it \u201cAttack of the cheese Episode 2\u201d and adding, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t happy after this one.\u201d In it, a baby seated in a high chair and clutching a sippy cup looks increasingly nervous as a luminous yellow slice of cheese gets closer and closer, then lands squarely on his face. Remarkably, the slice \u2014 which has not been identified but resembles Kraft Singles, a processed American cheese \u2014 proves to be extremely adhesive. As the baby blinks, his facial expressions revealing what seems to be a mixture of surprise and dismay, the cheese remains firmly plastered to his face, covering his nose and right eyelid.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo days later, as the footage was shared hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook, a man using the handle @unclehxlmes posted the same clip on Twitter and added the caption \u201cjust cheesed my little brother.\u201d Eight million views later, he felt compelled to clarify that the small boy in the video was not, in fact, his younger brother. He had deleted the tweet and apologized to the child\u2019s mother for invading the family\u2019s privacy, he wrote on Friday, explaining that the response \u201cgenuinely got way out of hand\u201d and that he had never imagined that throwing cheese on babies would turn into a trend.\n\nBut by then, it was too late. Under the hashtags #cheesechallenge or #cheesedchallenge, parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles and babysitters were eagerly tossing cheese at babies and documenting the results for posterity (and for likes on Twitter and Instagram). Others tested it out with toddlers, full-grown adults, disgruntled cats and even a Jonas brother. Amara, meanwhile, has taken down the video that started it all and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday night.\n\nIn certain corners of the Internet, news of the cheese-throwing fad was received as a sign that we are heading toward societal collapse. Meanwhile, unlikely alliances were forged as people normally on opposite sides of the partisan political and cultural divide were forced to acknowledge that they agreed on something: Hurling dairy products at a baby for social media clout is really, really stupid.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure anything better sums up the current moment we\u2019re living in than the fact that adults are throwing cheese onto toddlers\u2019 faces for attention online,\u201d tweeted the Daily Caller reporter Peter J. Hasson.\n\nThe liberal writer Molly Jong-Fast concurred: \u201cI can\u2019t help but feel humanity is doomed.\u201d\n\nAs Mashable points out, the cheese challenge bears a certain resemblance to \u201cdog cheese,\u201d a short-lived meme from last November that involved \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 lobbing slices of cheese at dogs. But while the dogs definitely liked it, it\u2019s not so clear how babies feel about having things thrown on them for the entertainment of Internet strangers.\n\nAD\n\nScroll through the comments on any popular #cheesechallenge Instagram post, and you\u2019ll find an all-out war: While some commenters feel that tossing cheese at a child\u2019s face and posting the video online without their consent humiliates them and is akin to bullying, others insist that it\u2019s ultimately harmless and the kids are having fun. One mother, responding to criticism on Instagram, fired back, \u201cMaybe you could try smiling or heaven forbid laughing one day! You might like it!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, so-called influencers have been among the most vocal critics of the trend. Social media personalities like Casey Neistat and Kalen Allen have politely asked parents not to throw cheese at their pre-verbal children, while model and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen wrote, \u201cI love a prank as much as anybody but I cannot get myself to throw cheese at my adorable, unsuspecting baby who has all the hope and trust in the world in me.\u201d\n\nOthers were much less restrained. \u201cDO NOT THROW CHEESE AT A BABY,\u201d tweeted the British actress India de Beaufort. \u201cWhat is happening?!?! How is this a \u2018challenge.\u2019 It\u2019s not funny. Your baby trusts you and has no ability to ask you not to mistreat them so just DON\u2019T. I can\u2019t even believe this has to be said?!?!?!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nApparently, it does need to be said. But there is good news for babies who are tired of appearing in viral videos with cheese on their faces: Internet fads are mercifully brief, and the cheese challenge will likely go the way of the mannequin challenge in no time.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nSix people were convicted of a murder they didn\u2019t even remember.
