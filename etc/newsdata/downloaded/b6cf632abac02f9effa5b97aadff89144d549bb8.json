Solving this problem \u2014 which is increasingly a national security issue \u2014 will require us to both make major policy changes and invent new technologies.\n\nThe Huawei problem is simple to explain. The company is based in China and subject to the rules and dictates of the Chinese government. The government could require Huawei to install back doors into the 5G routers it sells abroad, allowing the government to eavesdrop on communications or \u2014 even worse \u2014 take control of the routers during wartime. Since the United States will rely on those routers for all of its communications, we become vulnerable by building our 5G backbone on Huawei equipment.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that we can\u2019t trust computer equipment from a country we don\u2019t trust, but the problem is much more pervasive than that. The computers and smartphones you use are not built in the United States. Their chips aren\u2019t made in the United States. The engineers who design and program them come from over a hundred countries. Thousands of people have the opportunity, acting alone, to slip a backdoor into the final product.\n\nThere\u2019s more. Open-source software packages are increasingly targeted by groups installing back doors. Fake apps in the Google Play store illustrate vulnerabilities in our software distribution systems. The NotPetya worm was distributed by a fraudulent update to a popular Ukranian accounting package, illustrating vulnerabilities in our update systems. Hardware chips can be back-doored at the point of fabrication, even if the design is secure. The National Security Agency exploited the shipping process to subvert Cisco routers intended for the Syrian telephone company. The overall problem is that of supply-chain security, because every part of the supply chain can be attacked.", "description": "When it comes to 5G technology, we have to build a trustworthy system out of untrustworthy parts.", "authors": ["Bruce Schneier"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/opinion/25Schneier/25Schneier-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
