It is unclear how much of the final bill will be covered by taxpayers.\n\nQ&A Why did Thomas Cook collapse? Show Hide Brexit\n\n\u201cThere is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,\u201d said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier. Weather\n\nThe summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the \u201clates\u201d market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy. Competition\n\nA pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year. Banks and debt\n\nThe tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service. Bad management\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter. Nils Pratley, financial editor\n\nMore than 61,000 people had been brought home on 275 flights by Thursday night, four days after the Civil Aviation Authority launched Operation Matterhorn to bring back stranded holidaymakers. Another 72 flights were expected to bring home a further 16,000 people on Friday.\n\nThe CAA said that so far, 95% of customers had been returned on their original travel dates. It expects to have operated more than 1,000 flights in total by the time the operation ends on 6 October.\n\nThe collapse of the world\u2019s oldest tour operator in the early hours of Monday morning triggered the largest peacetime repatriation in UK history, an operation which is expected to cost around \u00a3100m.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThat adds to a growing bill to cover refunds of future holiday bookings under the Air Travel Organisers\u2019 Licence (Atol) insurance scheme, which government figures said have reached \u00a3420m.\n\nThe CAA chief executive, Richard Moriarty, said: \u201cDespite the challenges of this unprecedented situation, I am pleased that our Operation Matterhorn is on track with around 61,000 people flown home in the first four days \u2013 over 40% of the total.\n\n\u201cAround 95% of people have flown home on their original date of departure at the end of their holiday. An operation of this scale and complexity will inevitably cause some inconvenience and disruption and I am very grateful to holidaymakers for bearing with us as we work around the clock to bring them home.\u201d", "description": "More than 75,000 tourists to return home by Friday as repatriation bill tops \u00a3100m", "authors": ["Kalyeena Makortoff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bceeef1b5791ef5e00d778fec2f8840223c0b9b/0_20_3501_2101/master/3501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=abc00d70d7d4cb592fe362d6e1cbb18c", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
