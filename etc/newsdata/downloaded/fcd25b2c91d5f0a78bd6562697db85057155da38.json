Including eye care in national health plans and essential packages of care is an important part of every country's journey towards universal health coverage,\" he said.\n\nAgeing populations, changing lifestyles and limited access to eye care \u2013 particularly in low- and middle-income countries \u2013 are among the main reasons for increasing numbers of people with vision problems, according to the report released in advance of World Sight Day on Oct. 10.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that 65 million people are blind or have impaired sight when their vision could have been corrected overnight with a cataract operation, or that over 800 million struggle in everyday activities because they lack access to a pair of glasses,\" he added.\n\nServices must be provided\n\nEye conditions and vision impairment tend to be much more common among people in rural areas, those with low incomes, women, older people, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities and indigenous populations, according to the WHO's first report on vision worldwide.\n\nUntreated distance vision impairment in low- and middle-income regions is about four times higher than in high-income regions, and $14.3 billion (\u00b1R211 billion) is needed to treat the 1 billion people with vision impairment or blindness due to cataracts, and short- and far-sightedness, the report said.\n\nAccording to Alarcos Cieza, who leads WHO's efforts on blindness and deafness prevention, disability and rehabilitation, \"Millions of people have severe vision impairment and are not able to participate in society to their fullest because they can't access rehabilitation services. In a world built on the ability to see, eye care services, including rehabilitation, must be provided closer to communities for people to achieve their maximum potential.\"\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "According to the WHO Director-General, internationally, people who need eye care should be able to receive quality interventions without suffering financial hardship.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3869/20c0b2c20eba4e1994424f94b668dfdf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
