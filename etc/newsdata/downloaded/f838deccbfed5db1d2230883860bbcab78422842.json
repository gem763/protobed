(Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nYou think you\u2019re going to find support for impeachment, do you? You dare suggest that this presidency is embroiled in chaos? Well, I am at a truck stop right now to wait out an electrical storm, and nobody here agrees.\n\nI\u2019ve been interviewing for what I figure is at least an hour \u2014 the clock on the wall is broken \u2014 and everyone I speak to still supports the president just as much as they did the day he was elected. They are happy to say so, even if it means talking to folks like me on a daily basis.\n\nThe old man at the end of the counter shakes his head when I tell him the president is beleaguered by scandal. He\u2019s not tied to his phone, like some of you coastal types. He\u2019s not bound even to the latest fashion. I notice he\u2019s wearing an old wide-brimmed hat and rimless spectacles, the kind I haven\u2019t seen outside of movies. He says he\u2019s still with the president, and that he doesn\u2019t pay attention to the daily buzz of news. He has priorities like many real Americans have.\n\nI want to go out to my car, but it\u2019s raining too hard. Coffee here is only a nickel. I order another cup.\n\nI try to say something about the impeachment, but no one can hear me over the noise of the soybeans, growing healthy and strong. I have never heard a soybean so loud before. Here, we have our priorities straight, straight as the corn growing just outside the window. I can\u2019t see my car.\n\nThe TVs here aren\u2019t tuned to CNN or MSNBC for the scandal of the day. No, sir. They\u2019re playing what appears to be Rudy Giuliani chanting an uninterrupted mantra for the past six hours. When I look at my watch, the hands don\u2019t seem to move, but when I look at it again after my next sip of coffee, it says hours have passed. How long have I been here?\n\nSomeone tries to mention the phone call to the president of Ukraine, and out of nowhere, pigs in all the neighboring fields begin to screech, horribly, an almost human sound, and they only stop when he gives up mentioning it.\n\nThe storm is still going.\n\nYou might think Donald Trump was mired in scandal, but here at this diner, we don\u2019t agree. We like to see the media get riled up. The corn and soybeans don\u2019t care about what the president has been doing on his phone calls to Ukraine. Whenever I try to ask, something rustles against the window, and it\u2019s corn. I think it must be higher than an elephant\u2019s eye now. The corn is pressed right up to the glass. I think the corn wants to get inside.\n\nThere\u2019s a Norman Rockwell painting hung on the wall, and it says it doesn\u2019t think the president has done anything bad. There\u2019s a scarecrow in a pair of dungarees with a big pitchfork. He and his pitchfork both voted for Trump. They will vote for him in the next hundred elections. When I turn around from talking to them, I don\u2019t see the windows anymore. Is it day or night? I thought there used to be windows. Has it always been so dark? Are we underground?\n\nThe waitress refills my coffee.\n\nDo we even have foreign adversaries? I forget.\n\nAt this truck stop, no one has a reflection. It is 2016 here, I think. Joe Biden has done something wrong. Joe Biden has done something very wrong. Hillary Clinton had better not win. If she wins, the country will be broken for good.\n\nI can\u2019t see out the not-windows at all. I think we\u2019re definitely underground now. The walls are packed earth and so is the clock and it still hasn\u2019t moved and now there is something crawling in the wall.\n\nThe wall bursts! There\u2019s an enormous worm here, and I pledge allegiance to it, willingly. I burn my notebook for King Worm! We are burning everything.\n\nMy arms are now guns. Everyone laughs. This is our joke together.\n\nWe don\u2019t care about a single thing that President Trump has done since taking office. We are not ashamed to say so. We love the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We love the stock market. There\u2019s a crude drawing on the wall of a stock market going up and up, but it doesn\u2019t have a scale indicated on it. I don\u2019t remember coming here.\n\nReal America Doesn\u2019t Care About This Trumped-Up Scandal! Real America Doesn\u2019t Care About Any Of This! Giuliani\u2019s voice chants and chants and reaches a crescendo and the radio chants with it. We are here in the heart of America! The walls squeeze in and out, like the clenching of an enormous fist!\n\nSomething somewhere is screaming. Maybe it is the something that used to be me. I feel calmer than I ever have. The scandals don\u2019t touch us here.\n\nRead more from Alexandra Petri:\n\nBut was it quid pro quo? A guide.\n\nDonald Trump might get impeached?
