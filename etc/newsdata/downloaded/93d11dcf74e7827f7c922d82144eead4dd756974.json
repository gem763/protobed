But many also expressed misgivings about the overall direction of the lodestar of the Islamic world, and wondered just how far the changes would go.\n\n\u201cI view Saudi Arabia as the most sacred place for a Muslim,\u201d said Amirah Fikri, 30, an administrator in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, who called the kingdom \u201can example of a Muslim country in the eyes of the world.\u201d\n\nWhile reforms such as allowing women to drive and to travel without a guardian\u2019s approval are positive, some things \u201care better left unchanged,\u201d she said. The risk is of \u201charming the purity of Saudi when new, non-Islamic practices start to spread in the holy place.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi Murder\n\nThe Saudi bid to appeal to tourists with a relaxed dress code for foreign women and the promise of easier access to the country is aimed at diversifying the economy away from its overwhelming reliance on oil. But it also serves to present a softer image of the kingdom to the west at a time when its reputation is distinctly mixed.\n\nThe crown prince was excoriated internationally over the gruesome murder in Turkey last year of columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and his prosecution of a bloody war in Yemen resulting in famine and thousands of civilian casualties prompted Germany and other countries to halt weapons sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt home, the kingdom\u2019s extensive use of the death penalty, torture, arbitrary detentions of rights activists and \u201cseverely restricted\u201d freedoms are among the issues cited by Amnesty International in its overview of Saudi Arabia. \u201cDespite limited reforms, including allowing women to drive, women faced systematic discrimination in law and practice and were inadequately protected against sexual and other violence,\u201d Amnesty says.\n\nYet that evidence of the country\u2019s deeply conservative nature and its rigid interpretation of Islam helps to give a sense of the potential for domestic resistance to any kind of modernizing reform -- and the risks to the crown prince in pursuing change.\n\n\u201cTourism of course will help the economy, but if it involves anything that goes against our religious beliefs then it will not be accepted,\u201d said Sultan, a 33-year-old resident of Riyadh, who only gave his first name. \u201cOur religion is more important than anything.\u201d Foreign tourists will \u201cimport their culture\u201d and \u201cover time, these ethics and values will be stripped away from our conservative society.\u201d\n\nNecessary Change\n\nYet for many in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country in the world, Saudi Arabia has no choice but to open up.\n\n\u201cChange is a necessity,\u201d said Nasaruddin Umar, Grand Imam of Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta. \u201cThere will be pressure from the traditional clerics group in the country. But I see what MBS is doing as a smart move because he does so in a measured way.\u201d\n\nDidik Saputra, a 32-year-old high school teacher from Depok in West Java, one of the most conservative Muslim provinces in Indonesia, spoke while on a visit to the country\u2019s largest mosque in central Jakarta during its renovation and expansion.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia must accept changes without totally eliminating the old customs and practices,\u201d he said over the noise of construction workers. \u201cI agree with MBS that Saudi Arabia must be progressive and promote modernization of Islam. That would be good as it will also improve the image of Islam in the world.\u201d\n\nBeliefs and Culture\n\nThe threat of liberalization jeopardizing Saudi Arabia\u2019s global standing among devout Muslims is a proposition dismissed by Ahmed Al-Khateeb, chairman of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage and a key adviser to the crown prince. Saudi Arabia is any case no stranger to foreign visitors, he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect this to affect Saudi Arabia\u2019s image as the host for the Muslim world,\u201d he told Bloomberg Television in Riyadh on Thursday. \u201cThe Muslim world knows that Saudi Arabia follows rules and has beliefs and culture.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims look to one country above all others.As the birthplace of Islam, Saudi Arabia is a symbol of purity for many who direct their prayers toward Mecca wherever they are in the world.The latest in a series of liberalizing reforms attributed to the modernizing", "authors": ["Anisah Shukry", "Arys Aditya", "Archana Chaudhary"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oKfIHEQgc1TpiQkvzBU8gw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/e7bcf685b8276e681433d0564254e2bd", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
