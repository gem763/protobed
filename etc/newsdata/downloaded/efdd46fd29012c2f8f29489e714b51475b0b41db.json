The GOP Blames Everyone But Him.", "language": "en", "text": "In a July phone call, President Donald Trump pressured the Ukrainian president eight times to help him win the 2020 election by investigating former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.\n\nAnd in the weeks that followed, Trump held up $250 million in security aid, raising the possibility of extortion.\n\nJust take a minute to let that all sink in.\n\nTrump even confirmed his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and that their discussions involved Joe Biden and U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our people like the vice president and his son creating to [sic] the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d the president told reporters Sunday, adding that he had discussed \u201call of the corruption taking place\u201d in his conversation with Zelensky.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, flatly admitted that he asked Ukraine to look into Biden\u2019s family: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, this is bananas and grounds for congressional investigations or potentially impeachment.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s not Trump\u2019s fault that he asked a foreign country to interfere in our elections (again) because it\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s fault, the media\u2019s fault, Ukraine\u2019s fault, the fault of the whistleblower who filed a complaint about this in the first place and maybe part of a conspiracy involving a hidden government within our actual government.\n\nThese are just some of the excuses Republicans on Capitol Hill have come up with to try to defend Trump \u2015 part of a predictable pattern by GOP lawmakers who are too afraid to give a clear-eyed take on the president\u2019s actions because they\u2019ve tied their own reelections to staying on good terms with him. Even Republicans who used to call out Trump for his abuse of power have stopped doing it (remember Ben Sasse?) because they desperately want his support heading into the 2020 elections.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Republicans are defending Trump\u2019s request for election assistance from Ukraine, grouped into emerging themes.\n\nIt\u2019s a conspiracy!\n\n\u201cIt looks to me like another Deep State attack.\u201d \u2015Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)\n\n\u201cI think there are people in the intelligence community and other parts of our government who just have it out for the President.\u201d \u2015Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.)\n\nDemocrats are behind this.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never going to see the attacks stopped. The left will not give up because they cannot even accept the fact that they lost. They lost the 2016 election.\u201d \u2015Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t seen this movie before. Democrats come out, they\u2019re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out \u2015 Whoa, different story!\u201d \u2015Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio)\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are cranking up the outrage machine again, beating the impeachment drum. They didn\u2019t get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation. They\u2019re hoping they have something here.\u201d \u2015Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.)\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s wrongdoing, certainly we need to look at it. But my understanding of what has taken place is, this is just a different version of Russia collusion \u2014 Russiagate 2.0.\u201d \u2015Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.)\n\nDon\u2019t believe the media.\n\n\u201cI just frankly can\u2019t imagine why people have lost their minds so much over these daily reports of one thing or another.\u201d \u2015Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas)\n\nSurely this can\u2019t be as bad as it looks.\n\n\u201cThere might be a reasonable explanation for this.\u201d \u2015Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.)\n\n\u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out.\u201d \u2015Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah)\n\nTime to investigate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is going to blow you away with his willingness to disclose and be transparent about this phone call. The day that happens is the day that the inquiry about the interview with what was said by Joe Biden begins in earnest.\u201d \u2015Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in a Monday interview on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show.\n\nTrump is awesome.\n\n\u201cI think this president has been through enough. He\u2019s proven he can do the job and why are people listening to his calls and selectively putting something out for political gain? Let this president govern this nation. He\u2019s proved he can do it economically. This world is safer because of President Trump.\u201d \u2015House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)", "description": "It's the media's fault. And Joe Biden's fault. And the whistleblower's fault.
