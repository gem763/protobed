But the Kurdish fighters denied Turkish troops had seized the town.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRas al-Ayn is resisting, and clashes are continuing,\u201d SDF military spokesman, Mervan Qamishlo, said.\n\nAD\n\nA member of the Syrian National Army, an umbrella group of rebel factions allied with Turkey, said his forces were clearing roads inside the town. A resident of Ras al-Ayn, who fled the town earlier this week, said his relatives were still there and that Turkish-backed forces had taken control.\n\nTurkey launched its offensive, known as Operation Peace Spring, earlier this week as part of an effort to route the SDF from the border area. The SDF is allied with the United States in the battle against the Islamic State, whose members remain in Kurdish-run camps and prisons in northeast Syria.\n\nAD\n\nTurkey views the Kurdish fighters as terrorists for their links to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged a decades-long battle for greater autonomy in Turkey.\n\nTurkey has said it intends to press 18 miles into Syrian territory \u2014 a goal that seems increasingly difficult as international concern about the offensive escalates.\n\nAD\n\nVirtually all of Turkey\u2019s major allies have expressed fears that the Islamic State will reemerge as a result of the operation, as the Kurdish fighters are called away to the Turkish front. Those worries were brought into sharp relief on Friday, when the SDF said five Islamic State detainees had escaped from a prison in eastern Syria.\n\nAD\n\nTurkey is advancing into Syria along roughly 80 miles of the shared border, between the Syrian towns of Tal Abyad, on the west and Ras al-Ayn in the east, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the Pentagon\u2019s top general, said in a media briefing Friday. The flat landscape in that zone favors Turkey\u2019s conventional military in the battle, analysts said.\n\nBut for days, the Syrian Kurds have been able to carry out deadly strikes across the border \u2014 into Akcakale, across the border from Tal Abyad, and into Ceylanpinar, the Turkish town that borders Ras al-Ayn. Firefights have terrorized neighboring towns further east as well, including Qamishli, in Syria, and the Turkish town of Nusaybin, half a mile away.\n\nSarah Dadouch and Asser Khattab in Beirut contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The capture of Ras al-Ayn would mark Turkey\u2019s first major advance in battles to oust Syrian Kurdish fighters from the border.", "authors": ["Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region", "Kareem Fahim", "Istanbul Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Kjw43Dir460F4NtPX1kUT0-mLXQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OUGQK4HM6MI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
