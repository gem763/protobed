There was no \u2019spectacle\u2019 to the occasion. No thrilling rugby that drew the crowd from their seats in anticipation and delight at what they were witnessing. Instead, this was a painful walkover that points to a bias-ridden system that favours the \u2018haves\u2019 against the \u2018have-nots\u2019.\n\nSouth Africa certainly won\u2019t be fazed by such a result and such a performance. Rassie Erasmus\u2019 men had victory all wrapped up after 17 minutes, having scored four tries by that stage and, more crucially, secured the important bonus point that all-but confirms their place in the quarter-finals of the Rugby World Cup. For them, this was a light-hearted jog on an uncharacteristically cool evening here in Kobe.\n\nBut as with so many of the heavy score lines we\u2019ve seen rolled out at this World Cup \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s 71-9 the most recent example before this encounter \u2013 it leaves us facing a number of hard questions pertaining to the inequalities prevent within the sport. Because, for a tournament that is meant to represent the pinnacle of international rugby, in providing a sparkling platform to showcase the very best of the game, how can it be that matches of this nature continue to rear their ugly heads?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Fundamentally, Canada\u2019s \u2018unknown\u2019 element stems from a lack of opportunity. The chance for a side like Canada to regularly test themselves against teams of South Africa\u2019s calibre simply doesn\u2019t exist in the international game. The two teams had met just twice before this encounter, with the Springboks predictably coming out on top in both instances. Instead, Canada are expected to hone their trade against nations of a similar standard, thereby ensuring they\u2019re kept firmly within their insulated boxes of mediocrity.\n\nCritics of the World Cup schedule have also pointed to the bias weighted against the Tier Two teams, with a number of the tournament\u2019s lesser sides subject to quick turnarounds that are gruelling and unsustainable in nature. Although South Africa admittedly had four days to prepare themselves for this match after beating Italy 49-3 on Friday, the group stages have, in all, been kinder to the competition\u2019s top dogs.\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s the financial inequality that continues to plague the game, with wealth seemingly limited to an elite group that, unsurprisingly, dominates the sporting landscape. Calls have been made for fairer distribution of the money generated within the international game and to scrap the existing World Rugby model, with the \u2018reciprocal agreement\u2019 that sees cash-poor countries such as Samoa and Fiji expected to foot the bill of touring countries a fine example of the system\u2019s current imbalances. Indeed, there\u2019s a good reason why it\u2019s been 28 years since a team of England\u2019s standing have played Pacific Island opposition without actually setting foot there.\n\nAlthough the sights of these crushing defeats will never be eradicated from the game \u2013 such is its unpredictable, unexpected nature \u2013 more needs to be done to create a fairer, flatter playing field for nations like Canada and others to grow and compete on the main stage.", "description": "For all the upsets we\u2019ve been treated to so far here in Japan, South Africa\u2019s 66-7 demolition of Canada was an embarrassing reminder of the gulf in quality that separates rugby\u2019s heavyweights from the so-called \u2018Tier Two\u2019 nations.
