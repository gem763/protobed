But in the end, little Tobias found out about the 2003 attack from some family members.\n\n'I actually never really explained it to him,' the professional surfer told Us Weekly on Wednesday, while promoting her new documentary, Bethany Hamilton: Unstoppable.\n\n'I think his cousins told him. Kids will be kids. Word gets out.'\n\nCat's out of the bag: Bethany Hamilton's son Tobias, four, found out the details of her 2003 shark attack, despite her efforts to keep them from him until he got older\n\nThe Hawaiian native has also been reluctant to show her boy Soul Surfer, the 2011 film that chronicled the attack and her spirited recovery that was based on her 2004 autobiography.\n\n'Maybe when he's older if it naturally happens, but I wouldn't go out of my way to show it to him just because I want him to be a bit older,' she explained.\n\n'The shark attack scene is a bit gory and kind of crazy and hectic. I don't want him to have fears, even though he knows what happened.'\n\nFamily source: Some cousins told her little boy about the gruesome attack: 'Kids will be kids'\n\nHamilton, who also shares her one-year-old son Wesley with husband Adam Dirks, never let the attack deter her from her dream of being a pro surfer.\n\nIn fact, as a mom, she regularly brings both of her children to the beach to swim and surf.\n\n'My 4-year-old surfs. He started catching his own waves and he loves the ocean, so it\u2019s fun,' she said with pride.\n\n'[Wesley] usually screams the whole way, but he's stoked to be in the water.'\n\nUnstoppable: Hamilton, who also shares her one-year-old son Wesley with husband Adam Dirks, never let the attack deter her from her dream of being a pro surfer and from enjoying the ocean with her sons\n\nHamilton's brush with death happened in October 2003, during a morning surf along Tunnels Beach on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.\n\nWhile out trying to catch the perfect wave with her best friend Alana Blanchard and her friend's father and brother, Hamilton was attacked by a 14-foot tiger shark. Her left arm was severed just below her shoulder. The Blanchards helped her paddle back to shore and she was rushed to a local hospital.\n\nThe Hawaiian born surfer not only survived the attack, she also refused to let fear rule her life and was back out in the water three to four weeks later.\n\nFearless: Hamilton was attacked by a 14-foot tiger shark in October 2003 in Kauai, Hawaii; she is pictured not long before the harrowing event\n\nShe wrote about the harrowing experience in her 2004 memoir Soul Surfer: A True Story Of Faith, Family And Fighting To Get Back On The Board.\n\nBethany Hamilton: Unstoppable was released on home entertainment on Tuesday, October 15.\n\nThe documentary showcases her determination to return to surfing after losing her left arm, and includes archival footage of interviews she gave at the time.", "description": "Bethany Hamilton's four-year-old son found out about the details of her 2003 shark attack from his cousins: 'Kids will be kids.
