Ant and Dec.\n\nJaydee-Lee grinned before burying her face into mum Lindy\u2019s arm.\n\nThen Ant and Dec sprang another surprise, telling Jaydee-Lee she had won the Child of Courage Pride of Britain Award for saving her family from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Ant said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve done something very special and we wanted to give you a little surprise.\u201d\n\n(Image: TV Grab)\n\nDec said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this special gold envelope. It says Jaydee-Lee Dummett has been awarded the Child of Courage award at the Pride of Britain Awards. How about that? Well done, congratulations! Can we have a high-five?\u201d\n\nJaydee-Lee had been kept in the dark about her award and the meeting with her favourite TV stars, having been told she was to meet gas company bosses.\n\nSpeaking after the big surprise, Dec said: \u201cWe had so much fun surprising Jaydee-Lee. She\u2019s an amazing kid, who really deserves her Pride of Britain Award. It was a real pleasure to meet her and her lovely family.\u201d\n\nAnt added: \u201dJaydee-Lee had no idea and was so surprised. It was an honour to be part of her special day.\u201d\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nJaydee-Lee\u2019s mum Lindy was just as thrilled as her daughter to meet Ant and Dec, and the family later joined a host of stars at the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB.\n\nLindy said: \u201cThings like this don\u2019t happen to families like us. I can\u2019t wait to see it on telly.\u201d Before meeting Ant and Dec, Jaydee-Lee\u2019s image flashed up on a screen in Leicester Square, with \u201cJaydee-Lee is a hero\u201d across it.\n\nEarlier this year, she saved her mum and brother Laylan, four, when she saw the signs of deadly carbon monoxide at their home in Fochriw, Caerphilly.\n\nAfter waking in the night to find Laylan acting strange and disorientated, she had remembered a lesson in gas safety that Wales and West Utilities had given at her school weeks earlier.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror/Andy Stenning)\n\nShe recalled not only the warning signs of odourless carbon monoxide but the emergency phone number.\n\nLindy, 31, said: \u201cJaydee-Lee came out on the landing and said, \u2018Mam, what\u2019s that red light?\u2019 So we went to look at it and she said, \u2018Mam, that\u2019s the carbon monoxide alarm\u2019. She told me to call the emergency number.\u201d Jaydee-Lee interrupts: \u201cI told Mummy to call. I knew the number \u2013 0800 111 999.\u201d\n\nSean Ward, the Wales and West Utilities emergency engineer, was soon with the family and was highly impressed.\n\nLindy says: \u201cShe was in the kitchen explaining to him about the gas cooker, what colour the flame should be if it\u2019s safe. He went, \u2018Do you want a job with us? You know more than my colleagues\u2019.\u201d\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nEvery year, carbon monoxide poisoning kills 50 people in the UK and makes a further 200 seriously ill.\n\nThrough tears, Lindy said: \u201cWhen she grows up she wants to be a doctor. She wants to save lives, like she saved ours.\n\n\u201cIt could have killed us. We could have gone back to bed and it would have been a completely different story. To think of losing them is heartbreaking.\n\n* The Daily Mirror Pride Of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, will be on ITV on November 5, at 8pm.", "description": "Little Jaydee-Lee Dummett got the surprise of her life when Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly popped by for a visit", "authors": ["Rhian Lubin", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Tv Grab", "Daily Mirror Andy Stenning"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20760666.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screen_Shot_2019_10_30_at_14_52_31JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
