The start of the match was delayed by seven minutes as the Stade de France public address system played the national anthem of Andorra \u2013 the visitors on Tuesday \u2013 with Albania refusing to begin until the error was rectified.\n\nIn Group B, Cristiano Ronaldo scored to help ensure Portugal jump-started their campaign with a 4-2 win in Serbia. The defending champions drew their first two qualifiers but broke the deadlock in Belgrade three minutes before half-time against the run of play through William Carvalho. Gon\u00e7alo Guedes doubled the lead when he skilfully cut back to his left foot to ditch his marker.\n\nA Nikola Milenkovic header pulled one back for Serbia in the 68th minute, before Ronaldo, who had twice come close to scoring, took a through ball from Bernardo Silva and slipped it past the goalkeeper.\n\nFulham\u2019s Aleksandar Mitrovic hit Serbia\u2019s second with five minutes left, before Silva scored Portugal\u2019s fourth.\n\nPortugal climbed to second place behind Ukraine, who won 3-0 in Lithuania. They lead the way with 13 points after five games.", "description": "A 4-1 win for the world champions followed a Stade de France PA gaffe, while Portugal got their campaign on track with a 4-2 win in Serbia", "authors": ["Pa"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b1a60f038053f50faf4d23c4a07b6c4d7ea4926/0_12_1620_972/master/1620.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1ea801cf319e9929d281eb580483d3c0", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
