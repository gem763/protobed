His past two projects, Love Is Strange (2014) and Little Men (2016), were quiet sensations: New York\u2013set dramas of love, friendship, and disappointment that grappled with a changing city on a block-by-block level. Frankie is a bit more ambitious. Fran\u00e7oise \u201cFrankie\u201d Cr\u00e9mont (played by Huppert), a famous French actor, gathers her family members of several generations in the Portuguese town of Sintra to inform them she\u2019s suffering from a terminal illness. The action, such as it is, consists of Frankie trying to steer her kids\u2019 romantic lives toward futures she deems appropriate; as with many a Sachs film, her best-laid plans quickly disintegrate, thanks to her family\u2019s capriciousness. The film can\u2019t quite decide whether it\u2019s a comedy of manners or an intimate drama, its tone fluttering between raw emotion and something a little more whimsical.\n\nThe best material involves Ilene (Tomei), a stylist who worked with Frankie on a recent movie. Deciding that Ilene is a perfect match for her wayward son Paul (Renier), Frankie summons the stylist to Portugal, only to find that Ilene has brought along her lame-duck partner, a chummy cameraman named Gary (Kinnear). The couple met on the set of a Star Wars movie, and anyone who\u2019s ever wanted to see an Isabelle Huppert character react with disdain at the mention of Star Wars will find Frankie worth the price of admission.\n\nThe scenes that Sachs creates among Huppert, Tomei (who also featured in Sachs\u2019s Love Is Strange), and Kinnear (a standout in Little Men) show the writer-director at his best, striking a balance between melancholy and wit. Huppert can communicate Frankie\u2019s imperiousness in her sleep, but she excels at capturing the loss of control felt by a woman who, after blazing an impressive trail through life, is struggling to come to terms with the impotence of death. Tomei\u2019s character is a remarkable foil for her\u2014someone genuinely in awe of Frankie and enriched by their relationship, but independent enough to resist any matchmaking efforts.\n\nThe other strands of Frankie\u2019s family drama are less gripping. Sachs\u2019s skill lies in conversational dialogue, but when these characters talk, they have to get so much exposition out of the way that there\u2019s not enough time to investigate their underlying feelings. Gleeson is a sweet but subdued presence as Frankie\u2019s second husband, Jimmy, shuffling around in the background as he tries to deal with the prospect of losing his partner. A separate plotline follows Jimmy\u2019s daughter, Sylvia (Vinette Robinson), who is considering divorcing her husband; that narrative gets further complicated when Sylvia\u2019s teen daughter, Maya (Sennia Nanua), embarks on a rebellious romance in protest.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot for a 98-minute movie to handle, and much of the characterization gets lost in the shuffle. Frankie herself is an arresting figure, a protagonist worthy of Huppert\u2019s talent. But her family and friends are too thinly sketched to matter, even as Frankie winds toward its bittersweet conclusion; by the time the finale arrives, the movie hasn\u2019t built enough momentum. Sachs\u2019s understatedness is usually a strength, but here it feels like a weakness.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
