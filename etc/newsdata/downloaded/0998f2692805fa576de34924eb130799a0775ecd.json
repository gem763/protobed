Despite the name of the country splashed across their uniforms, almost none of the players who helped upset powerhouses like South Korea, Chinese Taipei and Cuba were actually Israeli. Instead, the roster featured a collection of Americans participating under the tournament\u2019s heritage rule, which granted eligibility to anybody with a Jewish grandparent or spouse.\n\nBuoyed by that unexpected success, Israel now hopes to earn a spot in the Tokyo Olympics next year, with baseball returning to the program for the first time since 2008. Unlike the WBC, the Olympic Charter requires all athletes to be a national of the country they represent\u2014a problem, since only about 1,000 people play baseball in Israel.\n\nSo Israel found a solution: Over the past year, more than a dozen Jewish-American professional ballplayers have obtained Israeli citizenship under the nation\u2019s Law of Return, a process known as making aliyah\u2014Hebrew for \u201cascent.\u201d With their help, Israel is one of 12 teams currently playing in the European championship, with the top five advancing to the Olympic qualifiers in Italy.\n\n\u201cPlaying for us was the impetus for this,\u201d said Peter Kurz, the president of the Israel Association of Baseball. \u201cBut they all feel something toward Israel. There\u2019s a feeling among them that we\u2019re doing something different, doing something more. The WBC experience was incredible. This could be even bigger.\u201d\n\nPitcher Joey Wagman in action for Team Israel.

San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon, a basketball player from South Dakota, played for Russia in 2008 and 2012, prompting U.S. coach Anne Donovan to publicly question her patriotism.\n\nBut the freshly minted Israeli baseball players believe their decision to make aliyah warrants a more nuanced calculation, given Israel\u2019s role as not just a geographic destination, but a spiritual homeland.\n\n\u201cIt might not be the country we were born in, but it represents so much,\u201d said pitcher Joey Wagman, a former minor-leaguer currently in the independent leagues. \u201cWe\u2019re representing the entire Jewish people.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s road to the Olympics is challenging. Only six countries will compete in the tournament, with Japan, the host nation, already claiming one of the spots. Israel\u2019s best chance of getting another would be to advance from Germany to the six-team Olympic qualifier in Italy later this month and win there.\n\nWith a 7-4 win over Britain on Tuesday, Israel moved to 4-0 in the European tournament, also beating the Czech Republic, Sweden and Germany. Still, the team\u2019s road to Tokyo almost certainly means going through the Netherlands and Italy, which have won the last 24 European championships, dating back to 1969. Israel currently ranks No. 19 in the world, behind the Netherlands (8), Italy (16) and the Czech Republic (18). Japan is at the top, followed by the U.S.\n\nTy Kelly is a former major leaguer.

MLB will not do the same, though in the past, minor leaguers have been allowed to play.\n\nBefore the WBC, the players\u2019 connection to their religious roots varied. A few, like pitchers Jeremy Bleich and Corey Baker, considered their Judaism an integral part of their identity. Others, like former New York Mets utility man Ty Kelly, grew up in mixed households that celebrated elements of multiple faiths. When Kelly started playing Catholic Youth Organization basketball in middle school, he said, the Jewish side started to fade out.\n\nMeanwhile, some players held only a tenuous connection to Judaism before baseball. Blake Gailen, a Triple-A outfielder in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, barely thought of himself as Jewish, despite his family ties. Nonetheless, he was so inspired by his experience playing for Team Israel two years ago that he traveled to Tel Aviv last October to finalize his citizenship.\n\n\u201cWhen we started playing, I realized, \u2018Wow, this is slowly beginning to mean more to me,\u2019 \u201d Gailen said. \u201cI completely identify now. I used to say, \u2018Yeah, I have Jewish bloodlines.\u2019 Now it\u2019s, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m Jewish.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s miraculous run to the WBC quarterfinals solidified the players\u2019 feelings. Several players, including those who reached the major leagues, called the tournament the most significant baseball event of their lives\u2014an experience chronicled in a new documentary, \u201cHeading Home: The Tale of Team Israel,\u201d which followed the team throughout the WBC.\n\nThe players all knew the stereotypes about Jewish athletes\u2014in the movie \u201cAirplane!\u201d when a character asks for some light reading, the flight attendant gives her a leaflet titled, \u201cFamous Jewish Sports Legends.\u201d Now all the players on a winning baseball team had just one thing in common: They all possessed Jewish heritage, a fact that conjured up emotions and feelings they didn\u2019t realize existed within them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played on other baseball teams and none had been that close, so it wasn\u2019t the baseball player aspect,\u201d Baker said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we were all Jews representing Israel. That common bond is why we felt that connection, and it obviously means something.\u201d\n\nIsrael's Blake Gailen looks on during the national anthem prior to the World Baseball Classic in 2017.

They have also aged out of Israel\u2019s conscription rules, a fact that multiple players admitted played a significant role to make aliyah. Pitcher Zack Weiss said that when he told his family he intended to become an Israeli citizen, \u201cMy mother had to make sure I didn\u2019t owe them any military service\u201d before offering her blessing.\n\nOne player, former Mets prospect Jeremy Wolf, did offer to serve in the military if Israel agreed to pay off his student debt. Israel declined. Wolf, however, recently signed a lease for an apartment in Tel Aviv and will spend at least the next year living in Israel full-time. He doesn\u2019t speak Hebrew, but, \u201cNow is the time to do something crazy,\u201d the 25-year-old Wolf said.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Is the tournament\u2019s heritage rule a good way to have more teams involved in international baseball competitions?
