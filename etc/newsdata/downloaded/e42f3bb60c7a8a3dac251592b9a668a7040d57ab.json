That allegation ought to make the owners of GE stock quite nervous.\n\nJust as GE is turning a corner under Culp\u2019s leadership, a story comes out that could torpedo General Electric stock.\n\nFailure to Disclose\n\n\u201cA joint Toronto Star/CBC investigation has found that for the past 15 years, GE has quietly paid to remove the hazardous material from local houses \u2013 after selling asbestos collected from its shop floor to employees between the 1940s and 1974,\u201d The Toronto Star reported on Sept. 17.\n\nA GE spokesperson said, \u201cThe health and safety of our employees and the public is a top priority for GE. Since 2003, we have removed insulation with asbestos containing material derived from the Peterborough facility. We will continue work with the community and homeowners if additional material is found.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, GE has paid to remove asbestos from 24 homes, the newspaper stated. However, asbestos could be in hundreds of houses in the town, according to Peterborough Councilman Keith Riel. If that\u2019s true, GE may have to foot the bill for millions of dollars of remediation work.\n\nThat\u2019s not a significant amount of money for GE stock. However, from an optics point of view, it just stinks.\n\nIn fairness to GE, if the asbestos remains untouched, it\u2019s not a risk. The material only becomes a health issue if it\u2019s moved.\n\n\u201cThe moral and ethical thing for GE to do would be to put out a real public health notification to the people they sold that stuff to about this danger, and about how they should deal with it, \u201d said Barry Castleman, a U.S.-based environmental consultant who has served as an expert witness about asbestos risks in about 24 American trials involving GE.\n\nBetween 1975 and 2019, according to Peterborough Public Health and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board of Ontario, the province in which Peterborough is located, there have been 685 disease claims by GE\u2019s workers. Just 43% of those claims have been approved for compensation, the board reported. A similar number of claims has been denied, and the rest are either pending or have been withdrawn, it added.\n\nThe cancer rate from asbestos in Peterborough is 40% higher than in the rest of Ontario. indicating that GE\u2019s alleged asbestos sales have had a meaningful, negative impact on the town\u2019s health.\n\nIn 2004, GE denied that it had ever sold asbestos to its employees. If its former employees hadn\u2019t found a 1956 GE newsletter that advertised that the company was selling 1,500 pounds of asbestos fluff each month, GE might not be in the situation in which it finds itself today.\n\nAs one CBC reader quite rightly commented, \u201cThe entire town should sue the pants off GE. Lord knows they have enough skeletons in their closet. It\u2019s about time they paid for it.\u201d\n\nThe Bottom Line on General Electric Stock\n\nAlthough Culp has done a good job righting the ship, investors should not own GE stock if they\u2019re looking for a great investment.\n\nAnd after what I\u2019ve read about how GE\u2019s handled its asbestos problem, I can\u2019t say I\u2019d be very proud to admit I\u2019m a shareholder of the company, either.\n\nBuy GE stock at your own peril.\n\nAt the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post GE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Asbestos Problem Is Terrible News for the Owners of GE Stock\u00c2 appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "The turnaround plan launched by General Electric's (NYSE:GE) CEO, Larry Culp, has been doing wonders for GE stock in 2019.
