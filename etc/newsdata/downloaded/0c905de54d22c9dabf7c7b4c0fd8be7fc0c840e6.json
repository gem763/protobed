He is a try scoring machine. #GEOvFIJ \u2014 Maggie Alphonsi MBE (@MaggieAlphonsi) October 3, 2019\n\nBetween tries and assists and general OHMYGAWDDIDYOUSEETHAT today\u2019s performance from Semi Radradra must rank right, right up there. #GEOvFIJ #RWC2019 \u2014 Andy McGeady (@andymcgeady) October 3, 2019\n\nThe Daily Telegraph\u2019s rugby reporter Jamie Pandaram also said \u201che can write his own cheque after this\u201d.\n\nRadradra carving up today against Georgia in #RWC2019. He can write his own cheque after this, no NRL team will be able to match his rugby salary #FIJvGEO \u2014 Jamie Pandaram (@JamiePandaram) October 3, 2019\n\nThe comment comes after the rumour mill went into overdrive that Radradra was pondering a return to the NRL.\n\nThe Fijian flyer made a name for himself in the code with 94 tries in 82 games for the Parramatta Eels before he moved to French rugby with Toulon.\n\nHe then moved to Bordeaux, where he is on a reported $A1m per year.\n\nCanterbury Bulldogs chief executive Andrew Hill confirmed the meeting with Radradra at the time and rugby league great Andrew Johns said the club should sign him for \u201c900k-a-year to a $1 million\u201d.\n\nmedia_camera Fiji's Semi Radradra celebrates after scoring a try.\n\nBut late last month, Radradra told The Sydney Morning Herald he didn\u2019t really miss the 13-man code.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to anyone (about returning to rugby league), I\u2019ve just told my agent to manage my off-field business,\u201d he said. \u201cI am just focusing on footy, playing good footy every week. I have to focus on the game (on Saturday) and the rest of the World Cup.\u201d\n\nAnd with a performance like that against Georgia, Radradra could have his choice of clubs or sports when his contract ends in 2020.\n\n\u2014 with AP\n\nOriginally published as \u2018World class\u2019: Ex-NRL star\u2019s Cup history", "description": "Former NRL star Semi Radradra has made himself one of the hottest properties in rugby after a jaw dropping World Cup performance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/881ad92f96e167782737ede629492042", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
