Here are some of the biggest things that set Southwest Airlines apart from other carriers. USA TODAY\n\nWhen Southwest Airlines announced plans in 2018 to begin service to Hawaii, the airline said it would initially offer flights from four California cities.\n\nFlights from two of the cities, Oakland and San Jose, began earlier this year, and Sacramento flights debut in November.\n\nThe fourth city, San Diego, has been left out. Until now.\n\nSouthwest on Wednesday said it will launch daily nonstop flights between San Diego and the Hawaii destinations of Maui and Honolulu in April with low-priced introductory fares.\n\nWhat to do on Honolulu? 10 must-see beaches beyond Waikiki\n\nFlights to Maui begin April 14, with flights to Honolulu starting April 20. Both come after the busy spring break and Easter travel season but ahead of Memorial Day and the start of summer vacation season.\n\nWith the San Diego flights, Southwest will have 28 daily flights between California and Hawaii. The much-hyped Hawaii flights, which the company says are doing well despite heavy competition between the West Coast and Hawaii, still represent a tiny portion of Southwest's daily schedule of more than 4,000 flights.\n\nSouthwest said it is also adding two additional daily flights between Honolulu and Maui, bringing the total to six and the number of overall interisland flights to 38 daily flights.\n\nThe announcement was made as part of the airline\u2019s schedule extension. Southwest's schedule, which opens in smaller increments than most of its rivals, was extended to June 6 from April 13. That still excludes most of the summer travel season.\n\nThere is plenty of fine print on the $129 introductory fares from San Diego.\n\nTravel is limited to select weekday flights, availability is limited and tickets must be booked Wednesday for travel through June 4. Dates around Memorial Day are blacked out. Previous Hawaii deals, including $49 one-way fares from Oakland in March, have sold out quickly.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/10/30/southwest-airlines-adding-hawaii-flights-san-diego-to-maui-honolulu/2504118001/", "description": "Southwest's newest Hawaii flights begin in April.
