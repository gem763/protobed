It\u2019s a bird emergency,\u201d said David Yarnold, CEO and president of Audubon.", "description": "Among the endangered species will be some of the most common birds found in North America, including the American Robin, the American Goldfinch, Saltmarsh Sparrow, the and the Oriole", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19549516-0-image-a-2_1570725338046.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
