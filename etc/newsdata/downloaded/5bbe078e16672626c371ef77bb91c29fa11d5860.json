The study found that 27 per cent of all Germans held antisemitic beliefs.\n\nNearly half claimed that Jews are more loyal to the state of Israel than to Germany, and 41 per cent felt that Jews talked about the Holocaust \u201ctoo much\u201d.\n\nA rising trend of antisemitism was seen amongst college-educated German \u2018elites\u2019 with an income of 100,000 euros or more per year.\n\nThe study stated that 18 per cent \u2018elites\u2019 held antisemitic beliefs, with 28 per cent feeling that Jews have too much control over the economy, and 26 per cent believing that they have too much power in shaping world politics.\n\nAntisemitism Offences Soar in Germany as Violent Attacks Jump by 60 Percent https://t.co/E4AwSd0UoN \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 13, 2019\n\nCologne Rabbi Jechiel Brukner, speaking to Deutsche Welle said: \u201cThese are cliches, stereotypes, envy, but there is also some truth to it. Jews are successful. What\u2019s the problem with that? Why are Germans not envious that, as a percentage of the population, Jews have many more Nobel Prize winners? Why doesn\u2019t that bother anyone? What does it always concern the aspect of \u2018money\u2019? Judaism places an emphasis on intellectual intelligence and that has meant that Jews are often very successful. They also work hard, but why does someone not like them for that?\u201d\n\nPresident of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald S. Lauder in an interview with S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung said the results of the study show that there is a crisis of antisemitism in Germany.\n\n\u201cWe saw what happened when ordinary people looked away or kept silent. It is time for all German society to take a stand and fight antisemitism head-on\u201d Lauder said.\n\nGerman Government Urges Jews: Fight Antisemitism, Wear Your Kippah https://t.co/ZF9gqnBgOg \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 28, 2019\n\nThe study was conducted two months prior to the deadly shooting outside a synagogue in the German city of Halle. The shooter, who is believed to have neo-Nazi sympathies, shot and killed two people on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar.\n\nTwo days after the Yom Kippur attack, a Syrian migrant stormed a synagogue in Berlin with a knife shouting \u201cFuck Israel\u201d and \u201cAllah hu Akbar!\u201d\n\nSecurity guards pepper-sprayed the man before he was able to carry out any violence. He was later arrested by police \u2014 he released from custody after just one day.\n\nIn 2018 there were at least 1,000 antisemitic attacks carried out in Berlin alone.\n\nTwo Killed, One Arrested in Shooting at German Synagogue https://t.co/J43iSRLEqV \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 9, 2019", "description": "A new study has found that more than one in four Germans have antisemitic beliefs, claiming that antisemitism is on the rise amongst elites.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Berlin-Jewish-Community-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
