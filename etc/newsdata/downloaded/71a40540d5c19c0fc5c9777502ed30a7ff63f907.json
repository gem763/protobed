REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China should ease regulations so that foreign financial institutions can obtain licenses and raise deposits more easily in the country, a senior executive from HSBC (HSBA.L) (0005.HK) said on Sunday.\n\nPeter Wong, deputy chairman and chief executive of HSBC\u2019s Asia Pacific operations, also told a financial summit in Shanghai that China needs to improve corporate governance and investor protection to mitigate systemic risks.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t want to have another situation ... similar to the Lehman crisis in China,\u201d Wong said, referring to the collapse of the U.S. bank that helped trigger the global financial crisis in 2008.\n\nChina has stepped up opening its giant financial industry amid a bruising trade war with the United States. Earlier this month, regulators announced a firm timetable to fully open its futures, brokerage and mutual fund sectors to foreign investors in 2020.\n\nWong said relaxed foreign ownership rules are very important for HSBC, which, in addition to its banking business, also owns insurance, asset management and brokerage ventures in China.\n\nBut other regulations also need to be relaxed, he said, for example to allow HSBC to expand its insurance business more easily into new cities and provinces in China.\n\nAnother obstacle, Wong said, is that \u201cit\u2019s very difficult for foreign banks to get deposits in China\u201d due to very stringent requirements, so China should \u201cfigure out a way\u201d to help them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for a number of years. Now we\u2019re developing, we\u2019re increasing our share, but the journey is not easy,\u201d he said.", "description": "China should ease regulations so that foreign financial institutions can obtain licenses and raise deposits more easily in the country, a senior executive from HSBC <0005.HK> said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445446566&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q08A", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
