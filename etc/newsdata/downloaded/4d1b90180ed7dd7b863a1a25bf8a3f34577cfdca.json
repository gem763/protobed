And would it even be a party without Craig Charles?\n\nWhat's the perfect party food?\n\nMy wife is a perfect host, and she gets all those canap\u00e9s and all that finger food and stuff. I like the little samosas and onion bhajis. I like it spicy. A good way to get a party started.\n\nWhat songs need to be on the party playlist?\n\nAnything by Stevie Wonder. You can't go wrong with Stevie, especially from his classic 70's phase. So, things like Sir Duke, I Wish, Superstition, stuff like that is proper go-to, party-starting music. If you can't dance to Stevie then you should throw away your feet.", "description": "You need lots of Stevie Wonder, a pair of comfortable shoes and some spicy food", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p05cq6sl.jpg"}
