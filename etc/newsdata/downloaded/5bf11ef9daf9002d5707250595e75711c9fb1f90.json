Putin directed the maneuvers from the Defense Ministry\u2019s headquarters.\n\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the exercise was intended to check \u201cthe military\u2019s capability to fulfill tasks in an armed conflict and a nuclear war.\u201d\n\nRussia has expanded the scope of its military drills in recent years amid rising tensions with the West. Relations plummeted to post-Cold War lows after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, and the Kremlin described NATO\u2019s drills near Russian borders as a demonstration of the alliance\u2019s hostile intentions.\n\nBriefing foreign military attaches about the drills earlier this week, Maj. Gen. Yevgeny Ilyin, the head of the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s international cooperation department, said they weren\u2019t directed against any specific country, but noted that the maneuvers simulated a response to a build-up of tensions near the Russian frontiers.\n\n\u201cThe maneuvers\u2019 scenario envisages an escalation of the situation in conditions of a remaining potential for conflict alongside Russia\u2019s borders that poses a threat to sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state,\u201d Ilyin said.\n\nThe statement echoed the Russian military doctrine, which states that nuclear weapons could be used in response to a nuclear attack or an aggression involving conventional weapons that \u201cthreatens the very existence of the state.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the United States withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, citing Russian violations, a claim denied by Moscow.\n\nPutin criticized the U.S. move, saying it undermined strategic stability. He pledged that Russia wouldn\u2019t deploy missiles previously banned by the INF Treaty to any area before the U.S. does that first.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s drills, Russia\u2019s nuclear submarines launched intercontinental ballistic missiles from the Barents Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk and a land-based Yars ICBM was launched from the military\u2019s launch facility in Plesetsk, in northwestern Russia.\n\nKalibr cruise missiles were fired by warships in the Black and Caspian Seas, while land-based Iskander cruise missiles were launched from the military\u2019s firing ranges of the military\u2019s Southern and Eastern Military Districts.\n\nAs part of the maneuvers, Tu-95 strategic bombers also conducted practice launches of cruise missiles at firing ranges in the Arctic and on the far-eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, the Defense Ministry said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday oversaw sweeping war games intended to test the readiness of the nation's strategic forces for a nuclear conflict.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vladimir Isachenkov"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/russia_putin_20328_c0-410-2580-1915_s1200x700.jpg?b186bd371bffbbf13506973bbfbb0e4203bea7e4", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
