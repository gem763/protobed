As Latin American countries changed from authoritarian and military rule to democracy, their new leaders and our government understood that creating fair, transparent judicial systems would be essential for sustaining true democracy. State Department and USAID officers who began their careers in Latin America would serve later in Eastern Europe or the Middle East because they had created some of the best practices in supporting democratic change. Sometimes the programs worked, sometimes they didn\u2019t. What didn\u2019t waiver was American support for the elements of good governance.\n\nRight up until 2017, when the Obama administration ended, our government\u2019s support for the rule of law and against corruption was a bipartisan goal. Indeed, when the George W. Bush administration created the Millennium Challenge Corporation in 2004 to engage in a new kind of foreign assistance, the first six of 17 listed criteria were: civil liberties; political rights; voice and accountability; government effectiveness; rule of law; and control of corruption. In that and other United States benefit programs then, officials in the executive and legislative branches believed that some success in reducing corruption in a country was required to justify sending it funds collected from American taxpayers.\n\nBut the policy went beyond logical fiduciary obligations. The United States, under Republican and Democratic administrations, stood for fairness, rule of law, and a level playing field around the world. To be sure, we didn\u2019t always succeed. But the point we were making was that we were always striving to meet high standards. And even when we failed, the examples of officials going to jail reminded us of our obligations to our national ideal.\n\nDuring my 31 years at the State Department, we brought members of the Justice Department\u2019s office of public corruption to countries to talk about best practices and outline some of the most serious cases in the United States, to underscore the point that while you could never completely eliminate corruption by public officials, the effort to bring them to justice was honorable, necessary, and often successful.\n\nIn destroying that consensus on the importance of the rule of law and the fight against corruption, the Trump administration has also delivered a significant blow to any ability of the United States government to hold the moral high ground on these issues. And that is a blow to our own national security, which is enhanced when we work closely with allies who share our values. Indeed, we prosper when our companies, bound by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, compete without graft for contracts and major commercial projects.", "description": "For nearly 30 years, America\u2019s diplomats abroad insisted on fighting corruption and promoting the rule of law.
