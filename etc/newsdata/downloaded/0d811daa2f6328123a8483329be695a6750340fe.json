During the interview, he dropped a couple of F-bombs against the people at Fox News. The host acted more amused than anything else at the actor\u2019s D-List performance.\n\nDe Niro caused an audible \u201cWoah\u201d from someone off-screen when he said \u201cF**k \u2019em. F**k \u2019em\u201d in response to Stelter\u2019s question about critics at Fox News. He used the same language during the Tony Awards in June 2018. So, Stelter asked why he uses that language. \u201cWe are in a terrible situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry. Sorry,\u201d the actor said. \u201cThis is cable, so it\u2019s not an FCC violation, but it still is a Sunday morning,\u201d host Stelter commented.\n\nThis political situation is a crisis, Robert De Niro says, and \"too many people are too gentle and genteel about it.\" He claims Trump is \"worse than I ever could have imagined\u2026\" pic.twitter.com/iiJKd7w5Hg \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) September 30, 2019\n\nTrump must be impeached, you see because we\u2019re in a crisis. For some reason, De Niro thinks people are being \u201ctoo gentle and genteel\u201d about that sentiment. Really? Americans who pay attention to politics seem to be in a state of perpetual outrage. I see very little genteel behavior on either side.\n\n\u201cIt has to happen,\u201d De Niro told CNN Business\u2019 Brian Stelter on \u201cReliable Sources\u201d Sunday. He called the present political situation a crisis, \u201cand too many people are too gentle and genteel about it. And we\u2019re in a crisis situation, period,\u201d De Niro said. Two days earlier, on the red carpet for the New York Film Festival opening night premiere of his new film \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d De Niro told Variety he hopes Trump gets impeached.\n\nLike other celebrities and public figures, De Niro has a history of anti-Trump and anti-Republican comments. When Alec Baldwin briefly hosted a talk show, De Niro was his first guest. During the premiere episode in October 2018, De Niro said he was \u201coffended\u201d by Trump and also by Republicans. In other words, criticism of Trump is expected of De Niro in these interviews. When De Niro walked out on the stage at the Tony Awards to present an award but first had to curse the president, he was rewarded with a standing ovation from the audience. This is how normal behavior looks to them.\n\nDe Niro called President Trump a \u201cgangster\u201d and labeled him as \u201ccrazy\u201d. When Stelter asked if he meant crazy as in the medical sense, De Niro said yes. Remember the phony psychiatric diagnosing of the president as mentally insane or at the least, unstable, by guests on CNN in past interviews? Facts don\u2019t matter. Science doesn\u2019t matter to the party of science. It\u2019s all about emotions and the inability of the left to accept the election of Donald Trump in 2016. Trump broke a lot of people.\n\n\u201cPossibly medically too,\u201d De Niro said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that before, but now I actually \u2013 when I saw him out in front of the helicopter waiting to go somewhere, talking endlessly and sweating and sweating \u2026 this guy, he\u2019s not even aware of what he\u2019s \u2013 he should at least ask somebody for a handkerchief or something and dry himself off.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s just something very strange,\u201d the actor added.\n\nSweating? Excessive talking and sweating are what Dr. De Niro bases his medical diagnosis on? Has he ever seen Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke or any number of politicians out in the sun for a lengthy question and answer stop? De Niro has so little to work with because it\u2019s his emotions, not actual facts, that moves him to such vulgar behavior. He is so Trump deranged that he has no other way to respond.\n\nStelter asked if De Niro thinks Trump is just acting. He was asking if Trump really believes the things he says. De Niro says yes, Trump may be acting. He also dragged FNC into it again.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, I think he is,\u201d De Niro answered. \u201cAs I think some of these pundits on Fox are too,\u201d he volunteered. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t believe they would actually buy into this craziness. This guy should not be president, period.\u201d\n\nHe thinks this way about Trump supporters, too, you know. There is no way that Trump supporters can actually believe in what they believe. Leftists are incapable of understanding that conservatives really think differently. De Niro attacks on a personal level, though, instead of raising objections to actual policies or actions taken by the Trump administration. He doesn\u2019t like Trump and that\u2019s all he\u2019s got.\n\nLike Alec Baldwin and Stephen Colbert, Robert De Niro cashes in on their hatred of Trump. Baldwin plays Trump on SNL and Colbert created Our Cartoon President for Showtime. De Niro played Robert Mueller on SNL. He\u2019s trying to continue that gig longer.\n\nAs for his portrayal of Mueller on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d De Niro said he hopes to bring the character back. He said he\u2019s already spoken to the show\u2019s Executive Producer Lorne Michaels about doing a sketch depicting \u201call the things people would have wished Mueller had done \u2014 would have done, should have done, could have done,\u201d while he was acting as special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDe Niro and his ilk can\u2019t let it go. Instead of being trapped in an endless cycle of yelling at the sky about Trump, he\u2019d do more good supporting a candidate in the 2020 election cycle. He can\u2019t help himself, apparently, and his own personal hell over the last presidential election is of his own making. Just wait until Trump wins re-election.", "description": "The actor performed for his host.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/38ad3f3f-5ccb-4e2b-9ee5-03b30b972c11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
