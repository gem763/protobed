Chris Christie, a Republican, used to berate hecklers on the boardwalk, faced off with furious union members at town hall meetings and hurled insults at Democratic enemies, using his tough-guy persona to became a global sensation before leaving office with a record-low approval.\n\nHis successor, Phil Murphy, a Democrat who has established little national profile since taking office last year, likes to avoid confrontation and portrays himself as a happy warrior who can get along with anyone, believing he can reason his way to success by getting the public on his side.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut it is Murphy \u2014 an Obama-era ambassador, former Democratic National Committee finance chair and now chair-elect of the Democratic Governors Association \u2014 who has caused the most problems for Democrats in New Jersey, where he has infuriated some of the party\u2019s most influential members. It\u2019s a dispute that could end Murphy\u2019s political career, or cause a seismic shift in how things get done in Trenton.\n\nWhere Christie cozied up to South Jersey\u2019s all-powerful Democratic machine, cutting deals that made his early success possible, Murphy has declared war on party boss George Norcross and those around him. Where Christie\u2019s hands-off approach to some legislative races paved the way for Democrats to build an enormous majority in the Statehouse, some party members think Murphy is hoping GOP incumbents keep their seats this November to dilute Norcross\u2019 influence \u2014 an accusation he denies.\n\nThe paradoxical approaches are both the result of the enormous sway Norcross, an insurance executive who has never held elected office, holds over politics in New Jersey. With control over most legislative votes from South Jersey and with Steve Sweeney, a childhood friend, in charge of the state Senate, Norcross and his allies have the ability to make or break any bill and block any gubernatorial nominee.\n\nAs Christie returns to the spotlight in New Jersey, launching an institute to put civility back in politics as he publicly bashes his replacement, Murphy finds himself in a protracted feud with Norcross, Sweeney and other Democrats. The fight is defining his time as governor and changing the paradigm in Trenton.\n\nWhile he\u2019s enacted low-hanging Democratic priorities, like a $15 minimum wage, Murphy is struggling to get his biggest campaign items \u2014 notably a millionaire\u2019s tax and legal marijuana \u2014 past lawmakers. And he\u2019s clashing with legislative leaders, and Norcross, over corporate tax incentives, perceived political slights and his more-liberal philosophies.\n\nChristie decided to cut deals with those Democrats so he could muscle big bills though the Legislature. Murphy thinks he can curb their power, pushing right through the bloc, but has so far had little success in doing so.\n\nSome observers say Murphy doesn\u2019t know the rules Christie embraced. Others say the second-year governor wants to write his own rules.\n\n\u201cChristie is a master at transactional politics and working multiple people in order to get something accomplished,\u201d said Matt Katz, the author of \u201cAmerican Governor: Chris Christie's Bridge to Redemption\u201d and a former Christie beat reporter. \u201cMurphy either doesn\u2019t know how to play that game or has no interest in that kind of work.\u201d\n\nAt the same point in his first term, Christie was working with some of those same lawmakers to push through property tax reforms and landmark pension and health benefits changes, while simultaneously badmouthing Democrats in press conferences and drawing the attention of GOP megadonors who wanted him to launch a bid for president.\n\nPublicly, Christie used Democratic leaders in the state as punching bags for his made-for-TV antics, and they usually responded in kind. Privately, he embraced some of them, notably Sweeney, the Senate president whom he usually found willing to cut a back-room deal.\n\nBut Murphy, despite presenting himself as a diplomat \u2014 and actually being one in his last job as ambassador to Germany \u2014 has angered Democrats time and again for any number of reasons.\n\nHe is locked in an epic debate, now involving criminal investigations, related to the state\u2019s multi-billion-dollar corporate subsidy programs, which expired in June.\n\nHe has irritated numerous county Democratic leaders with a fight over who should be the next state party chair, continuing to back an incumbent who\u2019s been a boon for some of his surrogates and political advisers.\n\nHe used a labor-fueled dark money nonprofit to push a millionaire\u2019s tax even as the state Assembly is up for reelection.\n\nAnd he recently riled the usually subdued Assembly speaker, Craig Coughlin, by using that same nonprofit group to push for higher taxes on the wealthy and by asking voters to lobby lawmakers on a bill to give driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants \u2014 a no-go topic in a few competitive legislative districts.\n\nCritics say they know exactly why Murphy would push the last issue: \u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t want Democrats to pick up more seats,\u201d one Statehouse Democrat said. Murphy, for the record, says he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d and believes \u201cthere are opportunities for our party to make some gains\u201d in November.\n\nSome think the governor\u2019s inexperience with \u201cthe ways of Trenton\u201d and with the art of \u201cpolitical maneuvering\u201d has put him in this position, said Carl Golden, a top aide to former Republican governors Tom Kean and Christine Todd Whitman. If Murphy played things carefully, he could have been cutting deals like Christie did rather than fighting over every other issue, Golden said.\n\n\u201cI think they had this idea that a Legislature controlled by Democrats \u2014 by the Democratic party \u2014 that all they needed to do was walk down the hallway with their agenda and get it done,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t happen, Golden said, \u201cthey didn\u2019t seem to know what Plan B should be.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s aides and advisers say he does have a plan, say he\u2019s accomplished plenty already and say they\u2019re quite happy to take a different approach than Christie. Murphy\u2019s focused on policy, they say, not backroom deal making, and that works just fine for him.\n\nIt\u2019s working politically, too, they say. For example, Murphy\u2019s fight for a millionaire\u2019s tax, no matter how infeasible it will be to get through the Legislature, is important to his progressive base. It matters more that he be seen fighting publicly for that kind of policy than avoid upsetting other Democrats by doing, they say.\n\nHis unwillingness to work with Norcross, they say, is a defining characteristic.\n\n\u201cIt would be a lot easier for Phil to get along with an unelected individual who has enormous sway over the Legislature \u2014 who literally controls the body itself,\u201d said a person close to the governor, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to speak frankly about their approach. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t seem willing to do that at the expense of the things he believes and ran on.\u201d\n\nSo far, he\u2019s kept his base happy, with strong union backing and the ongoing blessing of progressives, while maintaining an approval rating of 45 percent.\n\n\u201cI think the governor owes it to the people of New Jersey not to do \u2026 things the way they\u2019ve always been done,\u201d said Sue Altman, state director of New Jersey Working Families, a leading progressive group. \u201cI think the fact that Phil Murphy doesn\u2019t know the Trenton secret insider handshake is to his credit.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s feud with South Jersey Democrats began before he was elected. First, he pushed Sweeney out of the primary, then did nothing publicly to stop the New Jersey Education Association \u2014 the state\u2019s largest public-sector union and a major supporter \u2014 from spending millions of dollars to help a Republican candidate who ran unsuccessfully against Sweeney in his home district.\n\nSince then, Sweeney has squabbled with the governor on a number of issues, most notably Murphy\u2019s proposed millionaire\u2018s tax, and has built his own counter-agenda centered around cutting the cost of government in New Jersey.\n\nBut all of that was just a warm-up for this year, when Murphy appointed an aggressive task force to investigate the state\u2019s tax incentives programs, going straight for Norcross\u2019 wallet \u2014 and a Sweeney legacy item.\n\nSeveral businesses Norcross is associated with won hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits through the programs, which his brother, Donald, now a congressman, sponsored and a lawyer who works with another brother, Phil, had a big role in crafting. A large percentage of the total tax credits went to companies with ties to the brothers, mostly in exchange for opening offices in Camden, the state\u2019s poorest city.\n\nNow Norcross is suing the governor, the task force has issued a scathing report alleging widespread abuses and there is said to be both a state grand jury investigation and a federal inquiry being run by the FBI and prosecutors in Pennsylvania.\n\nMurphy\u2019s attacks on the incentive programs have riled up local leaders in Camden, many of whom are allies of George Norcross and benefited from Christie\u2019s interest in turning around the city. Some say Murphy is undermining the improvements of recent years.\n\nFormer Camden Mayor Dana Redd, who was also a state senator, said she\u2019s been \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the discussions around benefits that went to companies in Camden and thinks the governor may be giving the impression recent successes there are \u201ca false start.\u201d She said Murphy is \u201csending the wrong message.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever the disconnect is between the governor and others, hopefully they\u2019ll work it out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Camden should not be a casualty.\u201d\n\nThe tax incentive issue also brings things back to Christie, who signed the 2013 law and championed it as one the few ways to keep and attract businesses in the high-tax state. He also used it as one way to show he cared about urban centers, repeatedly pointing to job growth in Camden.\n\nWhen Murphy started going after the program this year, Christie \u2014 now a lawyer, real estate investor and ABC News personality \u2014 took personal offense and showed up defending the initiative and bashing his successor.\n\n\u201cI think this is nothing more than a political charade by a governor who hasn\u2019t had any real accomplishment,\u201d he told reporters last month after the inaugural event of his new Christie Institute for Public Policy.", "description": "A dispute that could end Murphy\u2019s political career, or cause a seismic shift in how things get done in Trenton.", "authors": ["Ryan Hutchins"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e4/47/29bf497d4642a245ec4e9e85f065/murphy-christie-900-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
