He has won the Rookie of the Year Award, been named the American League MVP and won the American League Cy Young Award.\n\nHe\u2019s an eight-time American League All-Star, has thrown three no-hitters and has won a World Series. On Saturday, he etched his name on another hallowed list in MLB history, becoming just the 18th pitcher to record 3,000 strikeouts.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nVerlander entered the evening needing six strikeouts that milestone. After striking out the side in the second inning, the right-hander whiffed Kaleb Cowart and Brian Goodwin in the third inning to set the stage for the historic accomplishment. It came the following inning, when he got Kole Calhoun to chase on a 2-2 slider.\n\nTo say he\u2019s among some pretty impressive company is a massive understatement. Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens, Steve Carlton, Bert Blyleven, Tom Seaver, Don Sutton, Gaylord Perry, Walter Johnson, Phil Niekro, Fergie Jenkins, Pedro Martinez, Bob Gibson, CC Sabathia, John Smoltz and Verlander. That\u2019s the entire list. If you\u2019re counting at home, that\u2019s 14 Hall of Famers, Roger Clemens -- who would be there if not for the PED allegations -- , Curt Schilling -- who is building momentum toward Cooperstown -- and CC Sabathia who\u2019s still active himself.\n\nNot that Verlander needed to add anything to his resume to ensure his place in the Hall of Fame, but he\u2019s an absolute lock now.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf notching his 3,000th career strikeout wasn\u2019t enough for a days work, Verlander was chasing after another achievement on Saturday as well. He entered the outing needing 12 strikeouts to reach 300 for the season. While Verlander had eclipsed the 200-strikeout plateau nine times in his career, his career-high had been the 290 that he punched out last season for the Astros.\n\nThe Calhoun strikeout that gave him 3,000 brought him to 294 for the season, but he still had work to do. After allowing a two-run homer to Andrelton Simmons after the Calhoun strikeout, and a single to Kevan Smith, Verlander sent the next five hitters down in order -- all on swinging third strikes.\n\nOnce again, needing just one strikeout to achieve a milestone, it was Kole Calhoun strolling to the dish with one out in the sixth inning. Calhoun foul tipped a 1-2 offering into the glove of Astros\u2019 catcher Robinson Chirinos, giving Verlander an even 300 for the season.\n\nThe victory was an important one for the Astros -- their 106th of the season -- as it guarantees them home field advantage throughout the postseason.\n\nIt also could have been an important one for Verlander, who is likely doing battle against teammate Gerrit Cole for the American League Cy Young Award. With the victory on Saturday, Verlander now sits at 21-6 on the season -- two wins more than any other pitcher in baseball -- though Gerrit Cole will have his chance to win his 20th in Sunday\u2019s regular season finale.\n\nAside from the gaudy win total, the 36-year-old hurler boasts a 2.58 ERA, a league-leading 0.80 WHIP and 300/42 K/BB ratio over 223 innings. Opponents are batting just .172 against him, the top mark in all of baseball. That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s a lock for that award though, as Cole has been equally as dominant. He heads into Sunday\u2019s start with a very comparable 2.52 ERA (besting Verlander for the top mark in the American League), 0.89 WHIP (second only to JV) and a league-leading 316 strikeouts. Opponents are batting just .186 against him, the second best mark in baseball behind Verlander.\n\nBest of luck to the Athletics or Rays. Whichever team survives the Wild Card Game will have to battle those two dominant right-handers in the first two games of the ALDS, before having to take on Zack Greinke in Game 3.\n\nThe Rookie Home Run King\n\nJustin Verlander isn\u2019t the only player who made history on Saturday night. Mets\u2019 rookie first baseman Pete Alonso slugged his way into the record books as well, clobbering a solo homer off of Mike Foltynewicz in the third inning. It was his 53rd home run of the season, setting a new MLB record for most home runs in a rookie season -- surpassing the 52 that Aaron Judge hit for the Yankees in 2017.\n\nThe 24-year-old received a standing ovation from the home crowd at Citi Field and a curtain call as well. He was completely overcome with the emotion of the moment, tearing up as he took the field to begin the fourth inning. When asked about what was going through his head in that moment after the game, Alonso admitted, \u201cHoly S, I can\u2019t believe that happened\u201d.\n\nOverall, Alonso has put together one of the more remarkable rookie seasons in recent memory. He\u2019s slashing .260/.359/.586 with a major league leading 53 homers and 120 RBI. It\u2019s even more impressive when you recall that it was a surprise when Alonso broke camp with the big league club coming out of spring training, as the Mets opted to take their best players north rather than playing the service time manipulation game.\n\nUnder team control through the 2024 season, Alonso should be a force in the middle of the Mets\u2019 lineup for many seasons to come.\n\nDevastating Defeat for Brewers\n\nAfter the Cardinals fell to the Cubs on Saturday afternoon -- their fourth consecutive loss -- the door was open for the Brewers to pull even with the Cardinals in the race for the division crown in the National League Central.\n\nIt had looked like that\u2019s exactly what was going to happen, as the Brewers carried a 2-0 lead into the eighth inning on Saturday. The Rockies wouldn\u2019t go quietly though, as Ian Desmond blasted a solo homer off of Drew Pomeranz in the eighth to pull to within one run.\n\nThe Brewers had an opportunity to add to their lead in the top half of the ninth inning, but Lorenzo Cain was cut down at the plate attempting to score from first base on a double by Ben Gamel. Cain collided with Rockies\u2019 catcher Tony Wolters on the play, spraining his left ankle in the process which puts his availability for Sunday in question.\n\nNot to worry though, the Brewers had lock-down closer Josh Hader coming in for the ninth inning with a one-run lead to protect. After retiring the first two hitters in the bottom of the ninth, pinch-hitter Sam Hilliard turned the postseason picture on its head by clubbing a game-tying solo home run.\n\nAfter the Brewers failed to score in the top half of the 10th inning, Trevor Story greeted Matt Albers with a walk-off homer to lead off the home half of the 10th, much to the satisfaction of Cardinals\u2019 fans everywhere.\n\nSo now, it will all come down to the final game of the regular season. The Cardinals, losers of four straight, will send ace Jack Flaherty to the hill against Derek Holland and the Cubs. Since the All-Star break, Flaherty is 6-2 with a minuscule 0.97 ERA and 0.74 WHIP across 92 \u2153 innings.\n\nThe Brewers will be sending Adrian Houser to the mound to take on Jeff Hoffman and the Rockies. That leaves Jordan Lyles as the next man up for the Brewers -- either in a potential Game 163 situation against the Cardinals, or in the National League Wild Card Game against the Nationals in Washington.\n\nAmerican League Quick Hits: Rays\u2019 manager Kevin Cash announced that Charlie Morton will get the ball for the Rays in Wednesday\u2019s Wild Card Game against the Athletics\u2026 Bo Bichette (concussion) has officially been shut down for the remainder of the 2019 season\u2026 Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was scratched from the Blue Jays\u2019 lineup on Saturday due to right knee soreness.
