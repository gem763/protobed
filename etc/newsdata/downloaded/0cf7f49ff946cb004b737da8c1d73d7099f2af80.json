Rather than allow Blue and White an opportunity to form a government, Netanyahu called for new elections.\n\nVoting began at 7 a.m. local time (midnight ET) at more than 11,000 polling stations. A total of 31 parties are contesting the elections, though only about 10 are likely to reach the threshold to win seats in the Knesset.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sebastian Scheiner/AP Sebastian Scheiner/AP\n\nOpinion polls ahead of Tuesday's vote showed the race between Netanyahu's Likud and Blue and White, led by former army chief Benjamin \"Benny\" Gantz, once again a dead heat.\n\nNetanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, has been dogged by multiple corruption cases charging alleged fraud, bribery and breach of trust. It is widely believed that if he manages to win a working majority Netanyahu will use it to pass a law granting him immunity for crimes committed in office. Netanyahu himself has repeatedly denied such a plan, labeling it as \"false media spin.\"\n\nWhen it comes to security issues the political differences between Likud and Blue and White are narrow, with both sides taking a similarly hard line on the regional struggle against Iran and relations with the Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu has pledged to annex the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, where Palestinians are seeking a separate state. Meanwhile, Blue and White says it wants to strengthen Jewish settlement in the West Bank and calls the Jordan Valley Israel's \"eastern security border.\"\n\nThe parties do differ on domestic issues, particularly whether to include ultra-Orthodox religious parties in a governing coalition. Gantz rules it out, leading to speculation he may form a secular coalition with Likud - but without Netanyahu.\n\nI had a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty, between the United States and Israel, that would further anchor the tremendous alliance.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 14, 2019\n\nNetanyahu has sought to use his close relationship with President Trump to political advantage and some versions of campaign posters feature a photograph of Netanyahu and Trump shaking hands and grinning.\n\nJust days ago, Trump also dangled the possibility of a U.S.-Israel mutual defense treaty \u2014 a move that seemed timed for the election \u2014 tweeting that he and Netanyahu could move forward with a treaty to \"further anchor the tremendous alliance between our two countries.\"\n\nIn an appeal to voters, Netanyahu, writing in the Maariv newspaper on Monday, said Israelis find themselves \"at the high point of an historic change in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\"\n\n\"I am asking now for your confidence in order to complete the historic task and fortify the State of Israel's borders and security forever,\" he said.", "description": "In the second election in just five months, Israel's longest-serving prime minister is hoping to eke out a governing coalition.
