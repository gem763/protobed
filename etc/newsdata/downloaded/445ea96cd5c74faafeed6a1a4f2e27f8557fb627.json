To completely shut off the American people and the Republican Party from such important deliberations is despicable. The House Democrats and the Democratic Party are so hard-up for a win that they would do anything necessary to get it \u2014 even cut off the people they were elected to represent from such important deliberations as impeachment hearings, which they have closed to the public and the Republicans.\n\nAmericans must demand that these hearings be opened up and that the information being heard be made public so that the Republican Party may conduct cross-examination and evaluation.\n\nBOB JACK\n\nNorth Las Vegas, Nev.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
