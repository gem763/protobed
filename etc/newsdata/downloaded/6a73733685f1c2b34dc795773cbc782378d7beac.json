This could be a turning point for the aluminium industry, for which we are uniquely positioned with our 2.3 million tonne hydro-powered Canadian smelters.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Harvey said he expected the global oversupply of alumina in 2019 would be bigger than previously thought.", "description": "Alcoa wants to cull poorly performing smelters and cut the carbon intensity of its fleet, both of which are gloomy portents for Australia's Portland smelter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/feaf4dacb031c7454b78e9673d8e8be811b8f57a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
