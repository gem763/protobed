The S&P 500 could rally another 3 to 5% as long as we don\u2019t see a policy mistake by the Fed and a complete collapse in trade war.\n\nAs we approach earnings season, the consensus is likely to see stocks deliver hardly any earnings growth over the next 12 months, with a strong economic recovery seeing 12% gains, and a recession led collapse seeing a 15% drop. With the trade war lingering longer than most haved expected, business investment is continued to remain stagnant. If we start to see a lot of pre-announcements over the next couple of weeks, we could see limited downside with U.S. equities.\n\nOver the past several trading days, cyclicals have been playing catchup as banks, retail, transports and energy all rallied strongly. The key to the next leg higher will depend on industrials and technology, thus re-emphaszing the importance of a substantial de-escalation in tariffs or even an interim trade deal.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes only.
