Now in seventh place among the 227 MEPs with outside earnings, Farage earns about \u20ac360,000 (\u00a3319,000) a year from his media company, Thorn in the Side.\n\nThe Brexit party\u2019s London member Ben Habib is the EU\u2019s best-paid MEP. Elected in May, Habib declared \u20ac960,000 annual earnings from First Property Group, the property fund manager he founded.\n\nThree other Brexit party MEPs make the top 10 ahead of Farage. At No 3 is Ann Widdecombe, who declared a second income of \u20ac240,000-\u20ac480,000 a year. The former Tory minister and reality TV contestant makes between \u20ac5,000 and \u20ac10,000 a month writing her Daily Express column, with a further \u20ac20,000 a month coming in from speaking and broadcasting.\n\nThe Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, has annual earnings of between \u20ac264,000 and \u20ac360,000 from his business interests.\n\nIn 12th place is the Conservative Brexit evangelist Daniel Hannan, who is paid at least \u20ac5,000 a month to advise the machinery manufacturer JCB. Chaired by the Brexit-supporting Lord Bamford, JCB paid Boris Johnson \u00a310,000 in January and has also had the former Brexit secretary David Davis on the payroll.\n\nAnother prominent name in the top 10 is the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, who earns between \u20ac180,000 and \u20ac426,000 for sitting on company boards and giving speeches.\n\nAll the outside earnings figures cited were before tax. Transparency International said the Brexit party contingent were \u201cthe top earners by a long way\u201d, with its 28 MEPs earning a total of between \u20ac2m and \u20ac4.7m on top of their monthly MEP salaries of \u20ac6,825 after tax.\n\nThe exact figures are unknown, as MEPs are only required to declare outside earnings in approximate amounts. The study reports MEPs annual earnings, but if Brexit goes ahead on 31 October, British MEPs would have sat for only four months of the current five-year term.\n\nAbout a third of the parliament\u2019s 748 sitting MEPs declared income from second jobs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Habib is the highest-earning MEP in the EU from a second job.

He earns between \u20ac204,000 and \u20ac444,000 from companies including a business running cancer treatment centres and another involved in solar energy.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful that Brexit party MEPs earn more money than arch-federalist Guy Verhofstadt, and get a lot more votes than him as well,\u201d said Lowe, who is one place ahead of the Belgian MEP.\n\n\u201cMany Brexit party MEPs are successful in the work that they do, the decisions they make, and the earnings list reflects that fact. It\u2019s important that voters who wish to attain the goal of leaving the EU have capable, experienced people to represent them to the best of their ability.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Verhofstadt said he had \u201cnothing against the establishment of an ethics body as proposed [by Transparency International]\u201d.", "description": "Five of party\u2019s members make top 10, as researchers raise conflict of interest concerns", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d09b2ff6bfc1264ebcd74b12421b563fee9a3176/181_430_2177_1306/master/2177.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbee47dbae125736c3dae442854a61b0", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
