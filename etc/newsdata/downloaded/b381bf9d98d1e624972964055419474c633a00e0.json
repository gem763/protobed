It will feature 15 of his songs, including a new one that he had composed for the production before his death on Christmas Day 2016.\n\nIt is a romantic comedy with serious themes, including the rise in homelessness and the \u201cdemonisation\u201d of migrants. In between other projects, Thompson and her husband, fellow actor Greg Wise, had spent seven years working on its screenplay.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress told The Telegraph: \u201cOne of the saddest things about this film taking quite this long was that George died\u2026 It would have been so wonderful had he been around, because\u2026 he was very passionate, particularly about the issue of homelessness\u2026 We\u2019ve [had] wonderful access to his work.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s music that he wrote for the film which is very spooky and spookily-apt because the screenplay wasn\u2019t quite finished when he was writing it. But he knew what the story was\u2026 So it\u2019s a very interesting marriage of ideas and music.\u201d", "description": "Dame Emma Thompson has spoken of her sadness that the singer-songwriter George Michael never got to see the feature film on which they had been collaborating before his sudden death aged just 53.", "authors": ["Dalya Alberge", "Tom Welsh", "Julie Burchill", "Simon Heffer", "Daniel Hannan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000207044208-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNUHzxaamNmHDqK-YksWRzyf4Kvgbevjd9uL9Ik_wNME.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
