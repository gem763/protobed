Maybe you only just recovered from a certain dreamy person making a permanent exit. Maybe you swore off the medical drama when Izzie started sleeping with a ghost. Or maybe you\u2019ve never laid eyes on an episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy in your entire life (who are you?).

It\u2019s a beautiful day to save lives \u2026 and also get caught up on a long-running medical drama.\n\nStart Here If: You\u2019ve never watched an episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy\n\nWelcome to fictional Seattle, where life and love and death and steamy hookups and medical marvels all convene at Seattle Grace Hospital. You have much to learn and so much to look forward to! Please know seasons one and two of Grey\u2019s Anatomy are treasures and if you have time to watch both in full (that\u2019s 36 episodes), you should.\n\nPerson to Know\n\nSeattle Grace\u2019s Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo): Meredith\u2019s likes: voice-overs that explain the theme of each episode, tequila, surgery, elevator rides full of sexual tension, dancing things out. Meredith\u2019s dislikes: being compared to her mother, renowned surgeon Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), having to keep her mother\u2019s advanced early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s a secret, finding out that her one night stand with the good hair is also her boss, hugs.\n\nMust-See Episode\n\n\u201cPilot\u201d (Season 1, Episode 1): At the very least, watch the pilot \u2014 it\u2019s good! You\u2019ll meet all the major players for the first few seasons. Aside from Meredith, these include Meredith\u2019s fellow interns: Cristina Yang (hard-core surgeon, cherished angel among all Grey\u2019s fans); George O\u2019Malley (dorky, in love with Meredith); Izzie Stevens (cheerful, one-time lingerie model); Alex Karev (total dick). You\u2019ll also meet her superiors at the hospital: their resident, Miranda Bailey (known as the Nazi, a complete delight); Richard Webber (chief of surgery, knew Ellis Grey, recovering alcoholic); Preston Burke (arrogant cardio-thoracic god); and Derek Shepherd (man with good hair, also very good neurosurgeon).\n\nRelationship Watch\n\nMeredith and Derek: Mer and Der (Patrick Dempsey) are basically the Prom Queen and Prom King of Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\nMeredith and Cristina: Let me spoil something for you here: Meredith and Cristina (Sandra Oh) are the greatest relationship in this entire series, don\u2019t @ me. They are kindred spirits, both insanely talented at what they do, neither is overly warm, both love tequila, and most important, they never apologize for who they are.\n\nCristina and Burke: Yes! There is another intern-attending romance afoot at Seattle Grace. Burke is all-in on Cristina from the get-go, but with Cristina, surgery will always be her greatest love. You should know two things about them: (1) Their chemistry is off the (medical) charts, and (2) Cristina gets pregnant toward the end of season one and schedules an appointment for an abortion without telling Burke anything. I know, drama!\n\nPerson to Know\n\nAddison Shepherd (Kate Walsh): In the season-one finale, a hot redhead walks into Seattle Grace, beelines for Derek and Meredith, and says, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Addison Shepherd [\u2026] and you must be the woman who\u2019s screwing my husband?\u201d That\u2019s right, you guys: Derek is married.\n\nVocab Lesson\n\nMcDreamy (n.): The nickname given to Derek Shepherd by Cristina Yang in Season 1, Episode 2.

Only one of them can live. You\u2019ve heard that people cry during Grey\u2019s? It starts here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World\u201d (Season 2, Episode 16) and \u201cAs We Know It\u201d (Season 2, Episode 17): Part one took the coveted post\u2013Super Bowl spot in 2006. Meredith has to keep her hand on a bomb inside a man\u2019s body to prevent it from exploding, Bailey has a baby, and Kyle Chandler is there as the bomb-squad leader. He dies. It\u2019s very riveting television!\n\nVocab Lesson\n\nMy person (n.): The only human you want by your side no matter the occasion. The one person who truly gets you. It was coined when Cristina listed Meredith as her emergency contact for her abortion appointment.

They break up briefly, but end up living together.\n\nAlex and Izzie: They fall for each other but Alex self-sabotages, cheats on her, and she ends things with him. He never stops having feelings for her.\n\nIzzie and Denny Duquette: Denny (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is a long-time patient of Dr. Burke\u2019s.

Also, Meredith and Derek have dirty hot sex and she must choose between him and Finn.\n\nStart Here If: You stopped watching when Denny died.\n\nDenny was very charming! It was a tough loss. But Seattle Grace moves on (mostly), and so should you.\n\nMust-See Episodes\n\n\u201cDrowning on Dry Land\u201d (Season 3, Episode 16): The second episode having to do with a massive ferry-boat accident. It\u2019s a great showcase for several characters including: Izzie, who gets her surgical mojo back post-Denny by doing brain surgery in the the field; Alex, who steps up his patient-care game; and Meredith who ends up drowning in the Puget Sound because she simply gives up. Derek pulls her out of the water and tries to save her. Both very dark and very exciting!\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t We Almost Have It All?\u201d (Season 3, Episode 25): Burke walks out on Cristina at their wedding.

He pops up in the season five premiere and becomes a permanent fixture at Seattle Grace a few episodes later.

She ends up leaving him.\n\nCallie and George: The affair comes out and this disastrous, impetuous marriage ends.\n\nIzzie and George: Once George ends things with Callie, he and Izzie make an honest attempt at things, but they realize they are better off as friends. So, all the drama was for naught.\n\nMeredith and Derek: They\u2019re off again, but this time, it\u2019s for real. Derek starts dating a nice nurse named Rose.\n\nAlex and Rebecca: Cripes, these two. Rebecca (Elizabeth Reaser) was a Jane Doe during the ferry-boat accident who needed a face transplant, and she and Alex form a deep bond.

Still, the relationship is a huge step forward in Alex\u2019s character development.\n\nMore Wrinkles\n\nDrama Rundown: Derek moves into Meredith\u2019s house, but things get rocky again while they work on a neuro clinical trial and Derek takes all the credit.

Several new characters arrive, but you only need worry about are Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), hotshot resident and grandson of renowned surgeon Harper Avery (he has a prestigious award named after him!), and April Kepner (Sarah Drew), eager to please and exasperating. Elsewhere, Webber starts drinking again and has to step down as chief \u2014 Derek takes the job. Bailey starts dating cute anesthesiologist Ben Warren (Jason George). Meredith and Lexie\u2019s dad, Thatcher, who started drinking after his wife Susan suddenly died, needs a liver transplant \u2014 guess which daughter is a match!\n\nBon Voyage: Izzie gets fired after a patient mishap, and leaves Seattle.

He almost dies and she has a miscarriage. Cristina is forced to operate on Derek with a gun to her head \u2015 afterward, she suffers from PTSD and can\u2019t operate for a long time. Alex almost dies of a gunshot wound. April and Jackson bond after losing their two best friends. Webber finally steps up and acts like the chief we all know him to be. And yes, everyone\u2019s experience in these two episodes is harrowing, but Bailey\u2019s will have you wondering why she ever steps foot in that hospital again. Hey, no one ever said watching Grey\u2019s Anatomy was fun all the time.\n\nRelationship Watch\n\nMeredith and Derek: They keep trying for a baby, but decide adoption is their best option. They meet a little girl named Zola and fall in love. Oh! They get married at City Hall, for real this time.\n\nCristina and Owen: Cristina has the hardest time post-shooting and one way she acts out is by marrying Owen. Although she wears a fabulous slinky red wedding dress, no one thinks this is a good idea.\n\nCallie and Arizona: Another couple spatting over kids. Callie wants \u2018em, AZ does not. Arizona takes off for a project in Africa and Callie stays behind, sleeps with Mark, and gets pregnant. Don\u2019t worry! They work it out, Callie and Arizona get married, and the three parent little Sofia together.\n\nMark and Lexie: The same story does not have a happy ending for these two.

They breakup, but make lots of moony eyes at each other.\n\nBailey and Ben: They break up after the shooting \u2014 Bailey is broken! \u2014 and she starts dating a very hot nurse named Eli (Daniel Sunjata). Bailey has great taste in men.\n\nTeddy and Henry: Teddy is trying her best to move on from Owen, and agrees to marry patient Henry Burton (Scott Foley), a chronically ill man in need of insurance. Twist: They really fall in love!\n\nThe Musical Episode\n\nYes, the rumors are true: Grey\u2019s Anatomy has a musical episode! \u201cSong Beneath the Song\u201d (Season 7, episode 17) is, um, not great. A very pregnant Callie is in a car accident and while holding on for dear life, imagines everyone singing. Instead of watching the whole episode, just watch Sara Ramirez murder \u201cThe Story\u201d by Brandi Carlile (above!). But, like, murder in a good way, not in a \u201close your medical license and go to prison\u201d sort of way.\n\nStart Here If: You stopped watching after seeing your doctors sing in the O.R.\n\nA lot of people did not enjoy that.\n\nMust-See Episodes\n\n\u201cDark Was the Night\u201d (Season 8, Episode 9) and \u201cSuddenly\u201d (Season 8, Episode 10): If you\u2019re tracking the Owen/Teddy saga \u2014 which you might want to do, seeing as she returns in Season 14 \u2014 you should watch this two-parter in which Henry\u2019s health suddenly takes a turn, and Owen has Cristina operate on him without telling her who the patient is. Henry dies and Owen repeatedly lies to Teddy to keep it a secret from her until she\u2019s finished her own surgery. She leaves by the end of the season. But in happier news: Meredith and Derek officially adopt Zola. They\u2019re really Mom and Dad now, not just our Mom and Dad!\n\nNew Wrinkles\n\nDrama Rundown: Derek and Meredith\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s clinical trial gets muddied up when it turns out that Adele Webber has Alzheimer\u2019s (yes, her too) and Meredith messes with the integrity of the trial to help her. It ends the trial, puts a strain on their marriage, causes a rift in Meredith and Alex\u2019s friendship (he turns her in!), and puts plans to adopt Zola on hold. Cristina gets pregnant, but wants an abortion; Owen reluctantly agrees \u2014 but never gets over it. The residents take their boards \u2014 April is the only one who doesn\u2019t pass, and she\u2019s fired, but she loses her virginity to Jackson and they have VERY hot bathroom sex, so her experience is really a draw.\n\nPerson to Know\n\nDr. Catherine Avery (Debbie Allen): A hardcore urologist and Jackson\u2019s mother.

Yes, built.\n\nMust-See Episode\n\n\u201cThings We Said Today\u201d (Season 9, Episode 10): We\u2019re deep into Bailey\u2019s wedding day, but she\u2019s at the hospital operating on Adele Webber.

When Bailey doesn\u2019t back Ben up, it causes a major rift in their relationship.\n\nMeredith and Men Who Are Not Derek: Mer hooks up with a hot military surgeon named Will, but it is way too soon. He tells her she\u2019s worth waiting for, but we haven\u2019t seen him since, so \u2026 And of course, there\u2019s Riggs. He\u2019s trying hard to win Meredith over, but she puts him off, especially after she discovers Maggie has it bad for the guy.\n\nAmelia and Owen: They fight and cry a lot, yet still, they would very much like to get married.\n\nMust-See Finale\n\n\u201cFamily Affair\u201d (Season 12, Episode 24): It\u2019s Amelia and Owen\u2019s wedding, it shows Meredith and Nathan bonding over lost love, demonstrates the dynamic between the Sisters (Meredith, Amelia, and Maggie), and has Alex reverting to his old ways and brutally beating up DeLuca when he misinterprets finding the intern with a drunk Jo \u2014 but really I am recommending this episode because BEN WARREN CUTS A BABY OUT OF APRIL KEPNER ON MEREDITH GREY\u2019S KITCHEN TABLE. Welcome, Harriet Avery, to Grey\u2019s Anatomy!\n\nStart Here If: You stopped watching after the kitchen table C-section.\n\nAdmittedly, it was a lot.\n\nNew Wrinkles\n\nDrama Rundown: Alex gets charged with felony assault but eventually DeLuca gets the charges dropped. Jo can\u2019t marry Alex because she\u2019s already married \u2014 and her name isn\u2019t Jo Wilson! She\u2019s been on the run from her abusive husband, Dr. Paul Stadler (Matthew Morrison). Maggie\u2019s birth mother shows up with breast cancer. Her death guts Maggie, but also brings her and Jackson, her mother\u2019s surgeon, closer. Jackson goes looking for his father, Robert Avery (Eric Roberts), in Montana, but realizes he never needed him. He and April sleep together one last time, but their romantic relationship is over. RIP #Japril. Amelia reveals that she got pregnant while still an addict and the baby was born with no brain. She doesn\u2019t want to have more kids, and Amelia and Owen separate. Later, she learns she has a giant brain tumor that\u2019s been growing for years, meant to explain some of her more questionable choices. It\u2019s the most dramatic of character cop-outs (also she has it removed and is fine). Stephanie leaves after a harrowing incident involving a rapist loose in the hospital who causes an explosion. Meredith and Riggs do it in the backseat of an SUV. I mean, they do it lots of places, but that place is the hottest.\n\nMust-See Episode\n\n\u201cWho Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story\u201d (Season 14, Episode 7): Grey\u2019s 300th episode! It\u2019s a big love letter to longtime fans, oh and no big deal but at the end of it Meredith Grey wins the Harper Avery Award. You\u2019ll be crying as an entire O.R. gives Mer a standing O \u2014 including, Meredith envisions, her mother.\n\nPeople to Know\n\nMegan Hunt (Abigail Spencer): Yes, you guys \u2014 SHE\u2019S ALIVE. She was held captive for ten years, but finally found and brought to Grey Sloan. It\u2019s Meredith who encourages Riggs to reunite with his lost love, and it\u2019s Meredith who comes up with a miraculous surgery to save Megan\u2019s life. Megan and Riggs quickly fall back in love and move to the sunny beaches of California with Megan\u2019s adopted son from her captivity.\n\nTom Koracick (Greg Germann): Amelia\u2019s neurosurgeon mentor (suck on that, Derek!), who arrives to operate on her tumor. He also most definitely hooked up with Catherine Avery at some point. He\u2019s mostly an arrogant dick to people, but during a fling with April (she suffers through an alarmingly self-destructive phase), he reveals he had a 10-year-old son who died in a freak accident. Dear lord, everyone on Grey\u2019s is dark and twisty inside.\n\nCarina DeLuca (Stefania Spampinato): Andrew\u2019s older sister who comes over from Italy to do a female orgasm study at Grey Sloan and generally embarrass her brother.\n\nIntern Roll-Call: Meet Levi Schmitt a.k.a. Glasses (a walking disaster who means well), Taryn Helm (crushing hard on Meredith), Vikram Roy (tries to sue the hospital, Bailey basically owns him now), Dahlia Qadri (third in her class, lovesick), Casey Parker (a transgender military officer and IT whiz), and Sam Bello (has a long romantic history with DeLuca!).\n\nRelationship Watch\n\nDeLuca and Sam: There\u2019s evidence to suggest that any time these two get together they ravage one another\u2019s hearts, but they still can\u2019t help themselves. Sadly, Sam must flee the country when they discover ICE is looking to deport the Dreamer. DeLuca is wrecked.\n\nBailey and Ben: Just when they\u2019re in a great place marriage-wise, Ben decides he\u2019s going to quit surgery and become a firefighter \u2026 just in time to join the Shondaland spinoff, Station 19! He\u2019s still around, but less than usual.\n\nMeredith and Not Derek: She\u2019s not all that interested in dating, but she meets a transplant surgeon and the two hit it off. Dr. Nick Marsh (Scott Speedman) was only in one episode, but by Shonda, he deserves to come back.\n\nAlex and Jo: Jo\u2019s abusive ex-husband finds her! It is terrifying! He gets hit by a car and eventually dies, but still, things looked dire for a moment or two there. Now Jo is free! She and Alex can get married!\n\nJackson and Maggie: They are hot for each other, but there\u2019s that small matter of them being step-siblings. They get over it and under each other!\n\nOwen and Teddy: Yes, Teddy! Owen flies to Germany to declare his love for her, they have a ton of sex, but in the end, Teddy doesn\u2019t think Owen is sincere.\n\nMore Wrinkles\n\nDrama Forver: April\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 Matthew shows up in the hospital with his pregnant wife; his baby is born but his wife dies. Bailey suffers a heart attack and it puts a lot of things into perspective \u2014 especially how taxing her chief of surgery gig is. Richard\u2019s longtime sponsor dies and he worries how the loss will affect his sobriety. Owen fosters a baby named Leo. Leo\u2019s teenage mom, Betty, shows up and she\u2019s a drug addict who Amelia decides to take under her care. The four live as some sort of makeshift family.\n\nWell, That\u2019s a Bummer: It turns out that Harper Avery was actually a terrible human who tried to sweep at least 37 instances of sexual harassment and misconduct under the rug with his money, but it all comes to light. They dismantle the Harper Avery Foundation. Jackson uses his considerable fortune to pay reparation to the victims. Catherine reverts to her maiden name, and The Catherine Fox Foundation is born. Meredith is disgusted and returns her and her mother\u2019s Harper Avery awards.\n\nMommy Issues: Alex finally makes amends with his mother. She is bipolar and Alex gave up most of his childhood to take care of her and his two siblings. Now she\u2019s back on her meds and doing well. They have a long way to go, but it\u2019s a start!\n\nMust-See Episode\n\n\u201cCold As Ice\u201d (Season 14, Episode 23): Surprise! April and Matthew have fallen back in love after suffering great tragedies, and then, because this is Grey\u2019s Anatomy, they get in a car accident that leaves April hypothermic and stops her heart. All the doctors work to get her back. The big takeaway here, though, is that Jackson, a man who could never quite swallow April\u2019s unwavering faith, prays to God to keep her alive and then she wakes up! He begins to question a lot of things.\n\nAnd Some Good Things!\n\nHappy Endings: After some hijinks, Alex and Jo are married by Meredith on a ferry, and April and Matthew decide there\u2019s no point in waiting and they get married, too. It\u2019s April Kepner\u2019s big send-off from the show. Also saying good-bye is Arizona, who decides to go to NYC to be with Sofia and newly single Callie. We\u2019ll miss them, but at least neither got hit by a semitruck! Elsewhere, Amelia and Owen are making googly eyes at each other and DeLuca drunkenly kisses Meredith..\n\nHey, Don\u2019t I Know You?: Teddy Altman is back \u2014 and she\u2019s pregnant with Owen\u2019s baby! So, that should be fun.\n\nStart Here If: You stopped watching when forced to say good-bye to Arizona and April.\n\nVery uncool, Grey\u2019s.\n\nPeople to Know\n\nDr. Atticus Lincoln (Chris Carmack): He\u2019s described as an Ortho God and gets a slo-mo entrance. None of this is wrong. He also knew Jo before she was \u201cJo\u201d \u2014 he and \u201cBrooke\u201d used to work together. Link survived bone cancer as a child, which inspired him to be both a surgeon and an optimist. He does things like cuts his gorgeous hair to make children feel better. He is perfect.\n\nDr. Nico Kim (Alex Landi): All orthopedic surgeons are hotties with bodies, according to Grey\u2019s Anatomy, bless this show. Nico is Link\u2019s ortho fellow and during his first surgery at Grey Sloan, winks at Schmitt from across the OR. A bold move!\n\nRelationship Watch\n\nMeredith and DeLuca: Neither of them can stop thinking about that drunken kiss, but DeLuca has to earn Meredith\u2019s affection by fighting through a love triangle with Link. Oh, he earns it all right. Meredith is scared to fully love another man again, but she cannot help herself.\n\nBailey and Ben: Ben\u2019s new gig as a firefighter and Bailey\u2019s stress at work prove to be too much and she calls a timeout on their relationship. It sticks longer than anticipated, but those two are in it for the long haul. They are hotter than ever!\n\nAmelia and Owen: Ugh, these two. They try to make it work again. They realize they are terrible together again. Owen will always love Teddy!\n\nTeddy and Tom: Oh, Tom. Although you are the perfect boyfriend for Teddy, I fear you will be collateral damage in the tornado that is Owen and Teddy. But honestly, has Teddy ever laughed so much? Has anyone on this show?\n\nTeddy and Owen: They are inevitable, it seems\u2014especially with a daughter on the way. Teddy may be in a safe, stable relationship with Tom, but she\u2019s never felt love like she does for Owen. Thanks to some much needed therapy, Owen realizes he\u2019s been sabotaging his relationship with Teddy all along, and as Teddy gives birth (welcome, Alison), he promises to prove his love to her for the rest of their lives. Will these two ever make it, or will they just destroy one another? Honestly, it\u2019s a 50/50 shot.\n\nAmelia and Link: This starts out as two hot people \u201cmanaging pain\u201d together, but it turns out they\u2019re very compatible. Also Link sits through a dinner with all the Shepherd women, which is a true feat of strength.\n\nSchmitt and Nico: Schmitt finally comes out and he and Nico get hot-and-heavy. Like, hooking up in an ambulance during a windstorm, hot-and-heavy.\n\nJackson and Maggie: Things seem to be going fairly well for these lovebirds until Maggie calls Jackson \u201cMr. Monopoly\u201d and thinks his privilege prevents him from understanding real life and Jackson basically tells Maggie he wishes she had a different personality. That is, um, yeesh.\n\nMust-See Episode\n\n\u201cSilent All These Years\u201d Season 15, Episode 19\n\nProbably the hardest Grey\u2019s Anatomy episode to watch in its 15 seasons, but an important one. Jo finds her birth mother and learns she was the product of a rape, which sends Jo down a very dark path, especially as she treats a patient who is the victim of an assault. It is as gutting and intense as it sounds.\n\nNew Wrinkles\n\nMore Drama, Please: Jo basically shuts down after discovering the truth about her biological parents and this threatens both her marriage and career. Eventually, she decides to take a leave of absence and get some real help. Meredith has a heartfelt one-on-one with Thatcher, just before he dies. It\u2019s very sad and moving and cathartic! Catherine Fox learns she has a gigantic tumor on her spine. Tom and Amelia get most of it out, but not all of it. Catherine and Richard\u2019s marriage only becomes stronger afterward, even though Catherine was reluctant to tell Richard since he recently lost his AA sponsor and almost relapsed. Meredith Grey, in her infinite wisdom, commits insurance fraud to help a patient, but it\u2019s DeLuca who ends up in prison for it, confessing to the crime to prevent Meredith from being arrested. Bailey unceremoniously fires Meredith, Webber, and Alex after learning they very much had something to do with it, too. The core four at odds! Oh, and also, there\u2019s this whole thing about a fetus being grown in an external sac and we see a lamb growing in a bag. If I have to know that \u201ca baby in a bag\u201d is a real thing, so do you.\n\nCongratulations! You just completed your crash course in Grey\u2019s Anatomy! Feel free to celebrate by dancing it out or drinking tequila, because you should feel confident enough to stroll on in to season 16 like a seasoned Grey\u2019s vet. But remember, there\u2019s always more to learn about the storied history of hot doctors in Seattle, and you never know who is going to walk through those hospital doors. Sometimes even ghosts!", "description": "Need a Grey\u2019s Anatomy catch-up guide before jumping into the show\u2019s 16th season?
