There has been the talk of a new film or TV series, but nothing has actually released in the last 3 years. Until late last week. For some reason the world received a new Ice Age video game, starring Scrat. It\u2019s weird that three years after the last film we get a new game. What\u2019s even weirder is that this game isn\u2019t bad. I\u2019d even say, I like it. Seriously.\n\nIce Age: Scrat\u2019s Nutty Adventure was released for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 18th. It stars Scrat, that weird and overly hyper squirrel (?) who is always looking for a nut. At the start of the Scrat finds ruins of a technologically advanced ancient squirrel civilisation. To unlock the secrets of the ruins and become powerful, Scrat needs to track down three super nuts. This is all real. I\u2019m not making any of this up. Honestly, it isn\u2019t that weird considering the last Ice Age film had a plot that was entirely put into motion by Scrat poorly operating a UFO.\n\nThe actual game is a fairly basic platformer with some light combat elements. The levels have a solid amount of variety and visually, these look pretty good. You hop around these levels, collecting gems and finding hidden items. You know, a video game. Nothing amazing.\n\nThe thing is, this game and its wild story reminded me of a lot of those licensed games we use to get back in the PS2-era of gaming. And it\u2019s odd to feel this way, but I think I miss those games? Sure licensed games still exist, but they\u2019ve all mostly moved to mobile platforms. Which is sad. Sure many of these licensed games were bad, but not all of them. And as a kid, it was so cool to play a game on my TV based on a cartoon or movie I loved. Scrat\u2019s Nutty Adventure feels like one of those games like it was frozen back in 2003 before it was published and only now, in 2019, has it been thawed out and released.\n\nThere are some annoying issues in Scrat\u2019s Nutty Adventure, for sure. The camera can bug out in places, animations don\u2019t always look great and combat isn\u2019t fun at all. But damn it, I still enjoyed it. I sat down to only play it for an hour, just to grab some screenshots and get a feel for it. But I ended up playing it for nearly 3 hours.\n\nIt\u2019s weird to have a nostalgic reaction to something brand new. I don\u2019t even like the Ice Age films or have any strong feelings about the franchise. But playing a colourful and simple licensed platformer did activate some part of my brain and made me happy.\n\nIt is very VERY easy to look at screenshots of this game or the trailer and dismiss it or make fun of it. And again, there are some problems and issues with it.\n\nBut if you ever played and enjoyed old PS2 platformers, good or bad ones, and miss those games, you might want to check out Scrat\u2019s Nutty Adventure. I\u2019m not promising some incredible, marvellous video game experience. Instead, I\u2019ll promise a simple and fun little platformer that feels like it fell off of a Blockbuster rental shelf, circa 2003. A game you play for a weekend, enjoy and probably never play again.\n\nWe have a lot of great indie games out nowadays that recreate NES or SNES gaming experiences. But for many people today, they grew up playing games on the PS2 and Gamecube. And this Ice Age game, even if it wasn\u2019t built to be, is a perfect love letter to a type of game from that era that we don\u2019t get anymore.", "description": "The last Ice Age film or short came out back in 2016.
