And we nearly didn\u2019t.\n\nTo date, I haven\u2019t had the heart to look at our house, car, life or health insurance premiums, superannuation, telco contracts or mortgage.\n\nWhy should consumers expect better treatment from their banks and their energy providers?\n\nMost of our day-to-day purchases are discrete transactions (think: lattes or shoes). Other purchases involve repeat or habitual transactions. By contrast, our inescapable need for energy and banking forces us into ongoing relationships with our providers. Critically, these relationships continue without our conscious effort.\n\nWe don\u2019t transact with banks and energy companies. We have ongoing relationships with them. Successful relationships are based on trust.\n\nMy bank and energy provider may not have breached the law, but they certainly breached the trust I'd placed in them. They dishonoured the implied tenets of our relationship. Like millions of other energy and banking customers, I felt betrayed.\n\nTo date, the predominant regulatory response has been to implement measures that help customers shop around if they feel sufficiently betrayed by such breaches of trust.\n\nThis response is flawed: morally and economically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt allows energy providers and banks to act with regulatory impunity in the hope their customers won't notice. These providers bear no responsibility for breaches of trust. Instead, customers are held responsible for failing to notice. That is not how healthy relationships work, commercial or otherwise.\n\nEven worse, this regulatory response punishes customers by imposing on them the search and transaction costs of finding a new service provider \u2013 hopefully one they can trust. But how would they know?\n\nThis regulatory approach inverts the logic of markets. It places no regulatory value on trust. Instead, it sanctions breaches of trust and it imposes dead weight costs on consumers thereby undermining the efficiency of these markets.\n\nThe well-established legal principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) may be acceptable in transactional markets, but it is inadequate in markets that rely on ongoing relationships such as energy and banking.\n\nThe time has come for a new principle to guide the regulation of these markets.\n\nLet\u2019s call this new principle \u2018sponsor venditor\u2019, loosely translated as: seller take responsibility.\n\nThis principle would hold banks and energy providers responsible for good customer outcomes. Such outcomes would not be contingent on customers noticing breaches of trust. Rather, banks and energy providers would be legally responsible for guaranteeing the good faith of their customers.\n\nBanks and energy providers would be responsible for delivering service outcomes their customers judge to be fair and reasonable, rather than outcomes that merely satisfy their regulators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, sponsor venditor would not mean more regulation. If designed well, it would mean less regulation, possibly much less regulation, as it would do away with the current mishmash of ad hoc consumer protections.\n\nAnother inquiry won\u2019t tell us anything we don\u2019t already know.\n\nAfter everything we have learnt about energy and banking over the past year or two, let's seize the moment for genuine reform. Consumers deserve no less.\n\nRon Ben-David is former chairman of Victoria\u2019s economic regulator, the Essential Services Commission.", "description": "No more buyer beware.
