What was initially classified as a sore knee turned out to be a torn right lateral meniscus, news that the Pelicans announced on Monday.\n\nWilliamson had arthroscopic surgery and is expected to miss six to eight weeks, postponing his much-anticipated NBA debut. The latter end of that outlook would have Williamson ready for the Pelicans\u2019 Christmas day matchup with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nZion Williamson's knee surgery marks the latest NBA star to start the season sidelined. (Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)\n\nWilliamson enters the league with more hype than any player since LeBron James joined the NBA in 2003. His stellar preseason that saw him average 23.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists only heightened the anticipation.\n\nThe biggest worries about Williamson\u2019s game when the New Orleans Pelicans made him the No. 1 pick in the draft was his 6-foot-7, 285-pound frame and his body\u2019s ability to support his unprecedented athleticism over the long run.\n\nThat he\u2019s dealing with a knee injury before his first NBA game is cause for concern.\n\nNets F Kevin Durant (Achilles)\n\nStory continues\n\nThere was hope in NBA circles that Kevin Durant could return in time for a potential playoff run after suffering a devastating right Achilles tendon tear during the NBA Finals. But the Brooklyn Nets have all but ruled out Durant for the entire season.\n\n\u201cWith Kevin, I think what we're going to say is the expectations are that he'll be out for the year,\" general manager Sean Marks said in September.\n\nIt\u2019s an understandably cautious approach as the Nets invested the future of the franchise in signing Durant and Kyrie Irving in free agency. Considering that Durant rushing back from a calf injury likely led to his Achilles tear, there\u2019s no reason to take unnecessary risks with their franchise centerpiece.\n\nThat said, if Brooklyn finds itself in contention late in the season and Durant gets a clean bill of health, the Nets haven\u2019t shut the door on a return for the postseason. Just don\u2019t expect it.\n\nWarriors G Klay Thompson (ACL)\n\nA game after Durant suffered his Achilles tear, the Golden State Warriors were dealt the crippling Game 6 blow of Klay Thompson tearing his left ACL when he landed awkwardly in the third quarter of the deciding game of the NBA Finals.\n\nLike Durant\u2019s injury, Thompson\u2019s was devastating for Golden State. Unlike Durant, there\u2019s optimism that Thompson will be able to return this season. Thompson re-signed with the Warriors during the offseason and general manager Bob Myers recently ruled out a return until after the February All-Star break.\n\nKlay Thompson could return in time for a Warriors playoff push. (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\n\nHis father and former NBA player Mychal Thompson told 95.7 The Game last week that he hopes he\u2019ll be ready for a March return for the final weeks of the regular season.\n\n\u201cI'm hoping sometime in March,\" Mychal Thompson said. \"There's no definitive date, but that would be nine months from the injury. As long as he's dedicated and determined in his rehab. \u201cHe's got a great physical therapy staff. He'll know before March \u2014 sometime in February or January \u2014 how he's feeling going through all the basketball drills.\u201d\n\nClippers F Paul George (shoulders)\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are perhaps the biggest benefactors of the NBA\u2019s offseason moves, having signed reigning NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and six-time All-Star Paul George. While Leonard is scheduled to suit up for Tuesday\u2019s showdown with the Los Angeles Lakers, George\u2019s debut will have to wait.\n\nGeorge underwent procedures on each of his shoulders during the offseason, and head coach Doc Rivers announced last week that he will miss at least the first 10 games of the season.\n\nThe news came as a surprise after George gave a more optimistic outlook in September.\n\n.@Yg_Trece gives an update on his shoulder injuries while speaking with @Powell2daPeople. pic.twitter.com/6vIAbSjQk7 \u2014 NBA TV (@NBATV) September 29, 2019\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m a lot far along ... I\u2019m not 100 percent, but if I had to put a percentage on it, I think I\u2019m about 85, 90-ish,\u201d George said in September.\n\nAs of Sunday, Rivers said that George wasn\u2019t participating in contact drills and declined to put a specific timeframe on his return. A 10-game absence points to a mid-November return, but with no reports of progress from his shoulder ailments, that appears to be an optimistic timeframe.\n\nLakers F Kyle Kuzma (foot)\n\nKyle Kuzma\u2019s remains one of the hardest injuries to analyze from a distance. The Los Angeles Lakers have ruled him out for Tuesday\u2019s season opener against the Clippers, but have declined to speculate further on the impact of the stress reaction in his left foot that surfaced during training camp with USA Basketball in August.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just talking about ramping up his activity, and we\u2019re not going to look past two days from now, which is Tuesday,\u201d head coach Frank Vogel said Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to increase his workload and activities this week, and we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nKuzma\u2019s been participating in non-contact drills at practice and told ESPN on Sunday that he\u2019s optimistic about returning sooner than later.\n\n\"I haven't really been doing too much, really, for the last two months, so just being able to shoot jump shots and being around the team a little bit more, it's optimistic, for sure,\" Kuzma said.\n\nBut stress injuries in feet tend to linger and carry risk of further damage. The Lakers are taking a cautious approach that points to a vague timeline for his return, which could arrive as soon as next week or much later.\n\nA timetable for Victor Oladipo's return remains vague. (Andy Lyons/Getty Images)\n\nPacers G Victor Oladipo (quad)\n\nVictor Oladipo\u2019s NBA breakout hit a big bump last season when suffered a season-ending tear to his right quadriceps tendon in January. He made a significant step in his return to the court Saturday when he participated in 5-on-5 halfcourt drills with the Indiana Pacers for the first time since suffering the injury.\n\n\u201cIt was good to see him out there,\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan told reporters. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t go up and down, but we scrimmaged the first half of practice 5-on-5. He looked good, played about 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nMcMillian said that for now Oladipo won\u2019t participate in drills in back-to-back days, according to the Indianapolis Star. But Oladipo plans to travel with the team during longer road trips as he continues to make small steps in his return, which is still weeks away, but does not have a specific timetable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just taking my time, my sweet time,\u201d Oladipo told the Star. \u201cI\u2019m talking as slow as possible. I\u2019ve been out nine months, so right now you\u2019re not going to see an ounce of frustration on my face. I\u2019m just happy I can play again.\u201d\n\nWizards G John Wall (Achilles)\n\nJohn Wall will miss most, if not all, of the NBA season after having surgery to repair a ruptured left Achilles tendon in February. The Washington Wizards announced in February that Wall suffered the injury when he slipped and fell in his home while recovering from a procedure to remove bone spurs in his heel.\n\nA team doctor diagnosed the Achilles rupture during a procedure to clean up an infection from the previous heel surgery. The Wizards haven\u2019t provided any status updates as the season approaches, but it will be a surprise if he suits up this season. The most optimistic outlook has him returning after the All-Star break.\n\nThe Wizards plan to get something from Wall as he begins the first of his four-year, $170 million max-contract extension this season. NBC Washington reports that Wall will serve as an unofficial assistant coach as he continues to rehab.\n\nMavericks F/C Kristaps Porzingis (ACL)\n\nUnlike the rest of the players on this list, Kristaps Porzingis is on the other end of a significant injury. The Dallas Mavericks took a cautious approach after trading for the injured big man last season, and he\u2019ll be ready to go for Wednesday\u2019s season opener against the Wizards after playing in the preseason.\n\n\u201cI feel great physically. I feel 100 percent,\u201d Porzingis said before training camp, via ESPN. \u201cI feel probably better than I ever have in my life.\u201d\n\nPorzingis suffered a torn left ACL in February 2018 while with the New York Knicks and hasn\u2019t played since as the Mavericks chose to let him continue to rehab after last year\u2019s midseason trade. While a significant amount of load management could be in store for Porzingis, the Mavericks are ready to showcase him alongside reigning Rookie of the Year Luka Doncic.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Zion Williamson joins a long list of injured NBA stars sidelined to start the season.
