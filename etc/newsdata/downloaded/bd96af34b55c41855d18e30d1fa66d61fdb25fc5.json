Park rangers are able to predict the eruption of six of them, including Old Faithful that has only lengthened the time between eruptions by about 30 minutes in the last 30 years. Four million people travel there each year.\n\nThe hospital told the Idaho Statesman that Siemers was in intensive care.\n\nIn 2016, Colin Nathaniel Scott, 23, of Portland, Ore., left the boardwalk section near the geyser and fell into a high-temperature, acidic spring. Recovery efforts were called off after rangers determined there were no remains left in the hot spring.\n\nThe death occurred in one of the hottest and most volatile areas of Yellowstone, where boiling water flows just beneath a thin rock crust.\n\nWater temperatures there can reach 199 degrees, the boiling point for water at the park\u2019s high elevation.\n\nAt least 22 people are known to have died from hot spring-related injuries in and around Yellowstone since 1890, park officials said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "A tourist visiting Yellowstone National Park on Sunday suffered severe thermal burns after he tripped into a hot spring near Old Faithful Geyser, according to local reports.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
