Richards partnered with designer Shahida Clayton on a new line, Kyle and Shahida, which debuted yesterday at New York Fashion Week. Crew members with giant cameras flew around the venue during the show, making it feel more like a TV set than a runway. Which, to be fair, was an effect Tommy Hilfiger and Zendaya strove for last night at their wild party at the Apollo theater.\n\nRichards says she\u2019s admired and worn Clayton\u2019s designs for years. \u201cI was always wearing her stuff to Coachella and my niece Paris [Hilton] would stop me and say \u2018I love those prints, who makes that?\u2019\u201d Richards told the Cut before the show. True, the line is not for minimalists. Almost every piece was printed, including a medley of jungle-inspired prints featuring monkeys, birds, and flamingos. \u201cA portion of the proceeds will go to a foundation helping out animals and the environment,\u201d Richards said. Currently, they\u2019re trying to find the right fit.\n\nBut the clothes were almost incidental compared to the models \u2014 Richards\u2019s Real Housewives cast members. Teddy Mellencamp, Lisa Rinna, Erika Jayne, Denise Richards, and Dorit Kemsley walked along with Faye Resnick, two of Richards\u2019s daughters, and \u201990s model Patricia Hartman. New cast members Garcelle Beauvais and Sutton Stracke sat in the front row, close to Paris and Nicky Hilton. Because it was a reality-TV shoot in addition to being a fashion show, many in the audience had to sign releases. (One front-row guest declined to sign one and spent the show hiding out near the photographers, away from the cameras.)\n\nMaybe because they were not just walking for the audience, but for all of their fans on Real Housewives, those modeling played it up. Rinna, decked out in a black bodysuit and a printed duster (to take her look and make it \u201cmore Kyle,\u201d according to the show\u2019s stylist Joan Reidy), twirled before leaving the runway. Richards high-fived Beauvais. Beauvais and Stracke smiled at every look.\n\nMany Housewives have used their status as TV stars to launch brands, to varying degrees of success. But Richards and Clayton have big dreams for their line. Clayton described the brands\u2019 aesthetic in one word \u201cempowerment\u201d and said she hoped it would be carried in all major retailers. Richards said their client goes up from \u201cyoung girls to older women,\u201d and added that men could wear the collection, too: \u201cSomething for everyone.\u201d Richards took a tearful bow with Clayton at the end of the show. Spliced into two minutes, it would make for pretty good TV. You can watch it on Housewives at some point next season.\n\nFrom left: Denise Richards Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images Lisa Rinna Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images From left: Denise Richards Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images Lisa Rinna Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images\n\nFrom left: Dorit Kemsley Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images From left: Dorit Kemsley Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images\n\nFrom left: Faye Resnick Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images Erika Jayne Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images From left: Faye Resnick Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images Erika Jayne Photo: FERNANDA CALFAT 27/Getty Images", "description": "Kyle Richards has a new fashion line, called Kyle and Shahida.
