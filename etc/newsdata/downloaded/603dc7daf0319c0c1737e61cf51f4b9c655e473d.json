Boston Beer has stemmed the negative impact of that shift by investing in the Truly brand it launched back in 2016 and by buying up quicker-growing Delaware craft brand Dogfish Head. Both of those moves have enabled Boston Beer to offset slumping sales of its flagship Sam Adams Boston Lager.\n\nCompetitor and Budweiser owner AB InBev (BUD) also made a play on the seltzer space by buying Bon & Viv Spiked Seltzer, though it has seen its market share fall by more than half over the last year to just 6%.\n\nIndustry leaders White Claw and Truly have been able to maintain marketshare despite brands in the space rising from 17 to a total of 33. More\n\n\u201cIn the context of hard seltzer, I would say White Claw and Boston Beer have been so focused on those two products,\u201d he said, adding that AB InBev has so many issues at a larger scale \u201cthat they can\u2019t focus as much as those two pure players.\u201d\n\nGrandet upgraded Truly\u2019s expected full-year growth to 160% from 140% and another 85% next year, considering room for distribution improvement. He was also upbeat about the fact that White Claw has been able to grow its share while also raising prices. Assuming Truly is able to do the same would serve to improve margins in future quarters, he said.\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
