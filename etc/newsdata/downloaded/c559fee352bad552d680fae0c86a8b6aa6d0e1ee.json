There was nothing in between. There were no Paul Rudd s. No kind-eyed Mark Ruffalo s.\u201d\n\nGulman has been a meticulous joke writer for years, a reliable killer on late-night shows, if not a star in the larger culture. In part, that\u2019s because his finest jokes don\u2019t hit you in the gut so much as tickle your brain. They have a literary quality, a rhythm and an ear for language that leads him to favor unexpected words (\u201ccretin\u201d) and phrases (\u201climit your quench\u201d). As David Letterman used to do in his late-night monologues, Gulman savors a colloquial term, repeating it until the mundane starts to sound odd. \u201cMillennials take so much flak, so much guff,\u201d he says, enjoying articulation, spitting out sounds with gusto. \u201cFlak as well as guff. I don\u2019t know what irritates me more, the flak or the guff.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t overexplain punch lines, which can sometimes put him ahead of the audience. In \u201cDepresh,\u201d one joke about how drinking Sprite in the 1970s could raise questions about your masculinity assumes a bit of knowledge of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d\n\nIn his last special, \u201cIt\u2019s About Time\u201d in 2016, Gulman expanded his ambition, earning a big comic payoff by fitting jokes into longer set pieces including the digression-rich epic on state abbreviations that is probably his most famous joke and one of the finest bits of the decade. Patton Oswalt has said he would steal it if he could get away with it. As respected as it was among comedy fans \u2014 and Gulman has enough stature among comedians to give out daily advice on Twitter, which has become a window into the craft of jokes \u2014 this joke did not make him famous, or happy.", "description": "Gary Gulman has always avoided hack comedy. In a new special, he finds himself in territory other comics have staked out involving depression. The results are fascinating.", "authors": ["Jason Zinoman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/05/arts/04COMEDY-GULMAN/04COMEDY-GULMAN-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
