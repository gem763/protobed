He\u2019s like my little brother.\u2019\n\nThe comment didn\u2019t pass fans by, with one writing: \u2018When Jeffree said James was like his little brother, my heart ached.\u2019\n\nJeffree said he was \u2018proud\u2019 of his \u2018little brother\u2019 (Picture: YouTube)\n\n\u2018The way he talks about James after he said all that s*** online really makes me feel gross inside,\u2019 another added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne more viewer wrote: \u2018It makes me kinda sad to see how Jefree was so proud of James and thought of him as his little brother and then all this drama took place\u2026. Like wow [sic].\u2019\n\nDespite the pair previously being close friends, drama kicked off earlier this year when fellow beauty guru Tati uploaded a 45-minute expos\u00e9 video on James, accusing him of lying about a brand deal and \u2018manipulating people\u2019s sexuality\u2019.\n\nJames then uploaded a video, denying many of the claims and telling his side of the story.\n\nJeffree later waded into the drama, supporting Tati as her subscriber count rapidly increased, and sending vicious messages to James, which the 20-year-old shared in a video.\n\nThe drama began when Tati uploaded an expos\u00e9 video about James (Picture: @Tati/Youtube)\n\nCalling a truce with his former friend, Jeffree then apologised for his part in the drama.\n\nHe said in a video, titled Never Doing This Again: \u2018Today I know what people want. They want me to sit here and degrade James. They want me to open up my phone and expose it all.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m done doing that. I\u2019m willing to bite the bullet and let anyone think what they want. But today I will not be posting voice memos, I will not be posting text messages.\u2019\n\nShane is set to address the drama (Picture: shane)\n\nThe star added: \u2018Yesterday took me back to the old Jeffree and I was in a very dark place, I sat there for hours and it started to get really dark in my head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018What I mean by that is you guys know me for being brutally honest, keeping it real\u2026 A lot of you have seen some brutal tweets and text messages.\n\n\u2018Because I sent those things it does not mean I hate James Charles,\u2019 he affirmed before saying: \u2018Are we the best of friends? No.\n\n\u2018But we had a connection and I think I mishandled our friendship.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
