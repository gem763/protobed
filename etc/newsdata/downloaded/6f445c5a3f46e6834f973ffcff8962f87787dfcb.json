As President Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Ms. Chao oversees the nation\u2019s shipping industry.\n\n\u201cThe Committee is examining your misstatements of fact, your actions that may have benefited the company in which you continued to hold shares, and your compliance with ethics and financial disclosure requirements,\u201d Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D., Ill.) wrote in the letter.\n\n\u201cSeveral reports indicate that you have used your official position to benefit Foremost Group, a shipping company owned by your father and sisters that is based in New York and operates a fleet that transports materials to and from China,\u201d the letter from the Oversight Committee stated, referencing in footnotes reports in the New York Times and Politico earlier this year. \u201cThese reports suggest that you used your official position to elevate Foremost Group\u2019s influence and status with the Chinese government, which has extended hundreds of millions of dollars in low-interest loans to the company for the purchase of foreign-flagged ships,\u201d the letter said.\n\nA DOT spokesman confirmed the letter was received and said the department looks forward to responding to the committee\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cMedia attacks targeting the secretary\u2019s family are stale and only attempt to undermine her long career of public service,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Ms. Chao still owned shares in Vulcan Materials Co. , the country\u2019s largest supplier of crushed stone, sand and gravel used in road-paving and building, despite promising to relinquish the shares.\n\nMs. Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), sold the stock in June. Vulcan shares rose more than 16% from April 2018, the month in which Ms. Chao had said she would cash out of the stock, through June 3, when she sold the shares, netting Ms. Chao a gain of more than $50,000, market data showed.\n\nIn an updated personal financial filing reviewed by The Wall Street Journal in June, Ms. Chao said she had been advised by ethics officials that the holding didn\u2019t represent a conflict of interest.\n\nThe oversight committee asked Ms. Chao to respond by Sept. 30 with all internal government communications about Foremost Group and Vulcan Materials Company; details about a canceled October 2017 trip to China and an official trip that she took to China in April 2018. The committee also requested her public financial disclosure reports and a description of how she has used a personal email account to communicate with her family or employees of Foremost Group about official DOT travel.\n\nWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "description": "The House Oversight and Reform Committee has requested documents from Elaine Chao for an inquiry into whether she has used her role as head of the Transportation Department to benefit her family.", "authors": ["Natalie Andrews", "Natalie.Andrews Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107680/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
