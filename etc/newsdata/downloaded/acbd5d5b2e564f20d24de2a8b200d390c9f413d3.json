The Social Security Administration each year bases its cost-of-living increase on the Labor Department's consumer-price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, or CPI-W, a measure of inflation.\n\nAARP Chief Executive Officer Jo Ann Jenkins said the increase was modest, but should help beneficiaries.\n\n\"Social Security's annual [cost-of-living adjustment] amount typically does not keep pace with all the increases in living expenses that most seniors face, including the costs of housing, food, transportation and, especially, health care and prescription drugs,\" Ms. Jenkins said.\n\nThe consumer-price index -- a broader measure of inflation than the CPI-W -- was unchanged in September compared to the prior month. The index increased 1.7% in September from the prior year, weighed down in part by lower energy prices. Gasoline costs, for instance, were down 8.2% year-over-year.\n\nAmericans have been paying more for health care, however, which could more acutely affect seniors on fixed incomes. Costs of medical services rose 4.4% in September from the previous year, according to the Labor Department.\n\nMedicare costs are also expected to rise next year. This spring, Medicare's trustees projected the standard monthly premium in 2020 for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other types of outpatient care, would increase by $8.80 a month from $135.50 to $144.30 per person. That would consume around one-third of the increase in the average Social Security retirement benefit.\n\n\"The good news is that you are getting some increase in your benefits,\" said Juliette Cubanski, associate director of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation's program on Medicare policy. \"But the bad news is higher Medicare premiums are going to eat up some not insignificant percentage of that.\"\n\nThe administration also announced the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax in 2020 will increase to $137,700 from $132,900, a 3.6% increase.\n\nAnne Tergesen contributed to this article.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 10, 2019 12:43 ET (16:43 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
