AI Could Change That", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s fire season in California. 100,000 people have faced evacuation in the south of the state, and many more risk losing power. Last year, more than 1.5 million acres were burned across California and 93 people lost their lives. These fires are hugely destructive and monitoring them is currently a manual process. AI could change that.\n\nThe California Air National Guard (CA ANG) is one agency that does this work. For years it has relied on a team of analysts who sometimes work round the clock to interpret aerial footage of fires, so that the perimeter of the infernos can be continuously mapped. That vital information is then passed on to first responders.\n\nBut CA ANG is hoping to get AI to spot the wildfires instead, because it\u2019s way quicker than humans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot faster than the current process, which is looking at the video, comparing that to a map then drawing it onto a map,\u201d explained Devaki Raj at CrowdAI, the firm that built the new automated system, dubbed FireNet.\n\n\u201cImagine the time savings between automatically getting this done at 20 frames per second and updating these maps,\" she added.\n\nIn a paper about FireNet published on the arXiv preprint server, the research team (which included CA ANG staff as well as the Department of Defense\u2019s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, JAIC) laid out just how laborious the manual process is. \u201cAn analyst must manually point-and-click for hours-on-end to create a fire perimeter polygon, often while working around-the-clock shifts,\" the authors wrote.\n\nWildfires don\u2019t just hang around. They can spread at speeds of seven to ten miles per hour in forests and even faster over grassland. That means that, in the two hours it might take an analyst to do their work, a fire could end up 20 miles or more from where it was when the video was captured. An AI in the pipeline could lead to faster response times.\n\nThe team's tool was inspired by AI systems developed to analyse medical images, for example to mark where a tumour ends and healthy tissue begins in a medical scan. In this case, the team trained their model on thousands of frames from videos of wildfires. The resulting system can identify the edge of a fire in infrared footage of a burning forest.\n\nCrucially, FireNet runs at a high frame rate\u2013up to roughly 20 frames per second with 92 percent accuracy. This means that it can plot the wildfire perimeter in near-real-time, as live video from aircrews is beamed to National Guard analysts.\n\nData on the fire\u2019s location is extracted from the video feed, and latitude and longitude information is collated so that accurate maps of the fire\u2019s current position can be generated for first responders. The system is also able to automatically flag hotspots of fire that break out away from the main perimeter.\n\n\u201cWe can tell them major off-shoots that are much more severe than what they had anticipated,\u201d said Raj.\n\nThe system is currently being \u201cactively tested,\u201d the paper authors confirmed in a statement via a spokesperson for the JAIC.\" They added that the results have been promising so far. \u201cAnalysts can automate the fire perimeter situational awareness as quickly as the sensor can reasonably view the fire,\" they said. According to the JAIC spokesperson, \"the CA NG is the end user and operator of the fire line detection aspect of this initiative.\"\n\nA rapid response system like FireNet is likely to be of great use to agencies responding to wildfires as they happen, according to wildfire expert and climate change scientist Dominique Bachelet at Oregon State University.\n\n\u201cWe need all the tools in the toolbox to try and manage them or at least get people out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d she said via phone.\n\nHowever, she notes that computer systems aren\u2019t infallible: \u201cThis is going to be a life-and-death situation so they better have machines with great backup.\u201d\n\nLike many machine learning systems, FireNet is being designed to supplement, not replace, human efforts. Even with AI in the mix, the existing manual process will still be there as a backup, according to the JAIC spokesperson.", "description": "California is looking to new, automated tools to help track and fight raging wildfires faster.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db0bedc62af2e008dc85333/lede/1571864442407-Untitled-design-1.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
