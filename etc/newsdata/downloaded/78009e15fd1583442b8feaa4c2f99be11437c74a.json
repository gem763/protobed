The drought, he believes, had a lesser impact on property prices aside from negatively impacting the Western Cape economy.\n\n\u201cA correction was expected to happen. The Atlantic Seaboard and City Bowl showed a combined growth of over 111% the past five years, which is simply exceptional,\u201d he says.", "description": "The completion of several new developments within the Cape Town City Bowl led to an oversupplied rental market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7554/14da4adf2e794a39ac96c8d61827274c.png", "published_at": "2018-06-21"}
