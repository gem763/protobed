If I give her this money, she can use it to buy clothes, food, and use it for my younger siblings as well,\u201d said Habil.\n\nAzri was moved by Habil\u2019s dedication as he knew that the youth\u2019s father had passed away some years ago, leaving his mother to raise his younger siblings alone.\n\nHabil\u2019s story has inspired Malaysian social media users to show appreciation for their mums while they still have the chance. \u2014 Picture via Facebook/azri.alwan More\n\nHolding back his tears, the businessman invited Habil to share a meal with him.\n\n\u201cI hugged him and said, \u2018It\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll join you for a meal. We\u2019ll eat together, okay?\u2019\n\n\u201cI went downstairs to buy some food and joined him once again to have dinner,\u201d wrote Azri.\n\nHe added that he was especially touched by Habil\u2019s mission to make his mother\u2019s life as comfortable as possible while he still can.\n\n\u201cHabil was only 19 when first came (to Kuala Lumpur) to make a living.\n\n\u201cThe words he said that truly left an impact on me were, \u2018It\u2019s okay, sir. I don\u2019t know how much longer my mum will be around.\n\n\u201c\u2018While she\u2019s still here, I want to make her happy. I don\u2019t have anyone else to look after, so it\u2019s fine.\n\n\u201c\u2018Furthermore, I\u2019m good at making a living on my own each day.\u2019\u201d\n\nAzri\u2019s post has gone viral on Facebook with more than 17,000 reactions and 12,000 shares, attracting the admiration of many Malaysians who commended Habil for being so filial towards his mum.\n\n\u201cPlease give my regards to Habil. It\u2019s a mother\u2019s prayer that shapes us into who we are today,\u201d wrote Mohd Farhan Haqimy Norizan.\n\n\u201cI hope everything goes well for Habil. Such an inspiring young man,\u201d said B Norerama D Pagukuman.\n\nRelated Articles Gut feeling: How C-sections change a baby\u2019s gut ecosystem Mexicans march for their missing children on Mother\u2019s Day US economist questions conventional thinking on raising babies", "description": "PETALING JAYA, Oct 24 \u2014 There\u2019s no force stronger than a mother\u2019s love, and the same can definitely be said about one Malaysian son's filial piety towards his mum.
