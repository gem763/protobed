She said that there are more jobs available than people looking for work.\n\n\"There are 20 million jobs on LinkedIn right now,\" Fisher said.\n\nRecruiters are seeking possible candidates like De Jesus both online and at career fairs around the country. And this time around, many recruiters are telling candidates that skills may be more important than schooling.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that there are so many jobs,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cBecause of this, companies are starting to look at what they used to use as these gating factors, and realized that what\u2019s more important is getting the right employee who's got the right skills.\u201d\n\n\"It\u2019s less about what school did you go to, do you have that four-year college degree, [and more about] can you do that job that we need you to do to be successful,\u201d Fisher added.\n\nFor De Jesus, looking for a job has been a full-time job in itself -- but she's confident she\u2019ll find the right job when it comes along.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it's about introducing myself and what I may be able to provide to anyone who is looking to fill a position,\" she said. \"And hopefully I can be that right person.\"", "description": "Experts say October and November is the best time to look for a job.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/AP_employment_application_jt_160902_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
