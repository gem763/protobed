He said he'd never been to school and hadn't been to the barber for nine years.\"\n\n(Image: Hollandse Hoogte/Press Association Images)\n\n\"He said he had brothers and sisters who lived at the farm. He said he was the oldest and wanted to end the way they were living.\"\n\nPolice were sent to the farmhouse where they carried out a search of the property.\n\nThey found a hidden staircase behind a cupboard in the living room that led down to a basement room where the family were housed.\n\nRuinerwold is a village with a population of less than 3,000. The farm is outside the village and is accessible by a bridge over a canal.\n\nThe farm, which is part-hidden behind a row of trees, also has a large vegetable plot and a goat.\n\nA neighbour told Dutch media that he had only ever seen one man on the farm, no children, and that there had been animals on the grounds, such as geese and a dog.\n\n(Image: Hollandse Hoogte/Press Association Images)\n\n(Image: Hollandse Hoogte/Press Association Images)\n\nThe local postman said he had never delivered a letter there.\n\nHe told Algemeen Dagblad news website: \"It's actually pretty strange, now I come to think about it.\"\n\nPolice in Drenthe confirmed that a 58-year-old man had been arrested and was under investigation after refusing to co-operate.\n\n\"Yesterday someone reported to us [that they were] worried about the living conditions of people in a house in Buitenhuizerweg in #Ruinerwold,\" they wrote in a tweet. \"We went there.\"\n\n\"We still have many unanswered questions,\" they said, adding that all scenarios were open and their investigation was fully under way.\n\nThe farmhouse and the surrounding grounds have been cordoned off.\n\nIt was unclear how long the family had been in the basement or what had happened to the children's mother, although the mayor said she had died some time ago.\n\nUnconfirmed reports suggested the 58-year-old had suffered a stroke and had been confined to his bed.", "description": "Police in the Netherlands found the family\u00a0 living at a farm in the northern province of Drenthe", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Wilbert Bijzitter Epa-Efe Rex", "Hollandse Hoogte Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586619.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Father-with-children-has-been-in-cellar-in-Drenthe-for-years-Ruinerwold-Netherlands-15-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
