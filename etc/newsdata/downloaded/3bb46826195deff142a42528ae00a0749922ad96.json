Wilde noted that these edits have a sexist bias, one that codes discussion or depiction of women\u2019s bodies (by female characters) as dirty, but keeps in scenes of boys behaving lewdly, like \u201cGeorge deep-throating a microphone.\u201d Wilde told the audience:\n\nWhat we discovered is that on certain planes, this film has been edited in a very slanted manner. That there are certain words and certain scenes that are cut out, that aren\u2019t the swear words. It\u2019s \u2018fuck, fuck, fuck\u2019 all day, but they removed the word \u2018masturbation,\u2019 they removed the word \u2018vagina.\u2019 So I\u2019m just curious what a woman is supposed to take from that. That it\u2019s an obscenity. That it\u2019s inappropriate. You can say \u2018fuck, fuck, fuck\u2019 \u2026 But you can\u2019t show the Barbie sequence when they take off their Barbie clothes and have Barbie boobs, which by design, have no genitals, which is the entire fucking point of the scene.\n\nWilde also expressed anger that an entire queer love scene was edited out for in-flight viewers, explaining that the version she saw on a Delta flight removed the hook-up scene between characters played by Diana Silvers and Kaitlyn Dever. She theorized they cut it \u201cbecause it might suggest to you that women, I don\u2019t know, have bodies or can experience pleasure, or deserve it. And so that is\u2026 it\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nWilde advised that other female filmmakers watch airline edits of their films to see what else is being removed without their knowledge or permission. \u201cThe other word they took out was UTI, which, I was like\u2026 I feel like we should tell people about UTIs! It\u2019s important. But yeah, I think it\u2019s like, make movies that are, you know, authentic, and talk about real things, and then protect those movies and don\u2019t let anybody censor you.\u201d\n\nThese in-flight edits are an affront to Olivia Wilde, an affront to young female viewers, and mostly an affront to Booksmart\u2019s resident airplane-lover, Jared. So not-woke of you, Delta.", "description": "During a Q&A at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival, Booksmart director Olivia Wilde  addressed Delta\u2019s censorship of her teen comedy.
