Another said he was annoyed. A third said Blackstone execs have used Goldman's plans as an excuse to try and poach talented workers.\n\nAnother person familiar with the situation said Goldman had managed conflicts with Blackstone in the past and didn't think its latest plans would damage the longstanding relationship. To the extent dealmakers are irritated, it would be tamped down and managed, the person said. So far, Blackstone's grumbling has not resulted in any known business repercussions, with the chatter confined to private circles.\n\n\"Blackstone has a terrific relationship with Goldman Sachs,\" a Blackstone spokesman said. \"We expect to continue to do significant business with them going forward.\"\n\nAnd yet Blackstone isn't the only buyout fund alarmed by Goldman's recent plans. Other firms are bracing themselves to compete more fiercely across private-equity, real-estate, and private-credit markets, according to a banker at a rival firm who has heard from clients about this particular issue.\n\nRead more: 'It's good to be Rich': Meet the Goldman Sachs banker who has built a private investing empire that goes head-to-head with Blackstone \u2014 and you've probably never heard of him\n\nCourting conflicts with clients\n\nPrivate-equity and real-estate execs are annoyed that Goldman would pursue a plan to compete more directly for deals, even as its top-ranked investment-banking division views the same firms as a source of M&A and capital-raising fees, the people said. The industry is among the biggest payers of fees to Wall Street, with Blackstone and Carlyle ranking second and third since 2014, at $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, according to Refinitiv.\n\nThe concern is all the more acute because of Goldman's position on Wall Street of having a buyout arm and Blackstone's decision to sell its advisory business several years ago, in part, to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nGoldman CEO David Solomon addressed the topic after the Wall Street analysts Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI and Christian Bolu of Autonomous Research raised it on the firm's July conference call. Both analysts said they expected Goldman to increasingly come into conflict with clients.\n\n\"I can say that there are issues from time to time that come out of this business model, but we're focused on striking the right balance and have proven over the long period of time that I think we can do this consistently,\" Solomon said. \"We are talking to our clients and listening to our clients.\" A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment beyond his remarks.\n\nThat Goldman would court conflicts with clients isn't new. The bank has operated a private-investing business since 1991 and ranks as one of the largest alternative-asset managers in the world.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs is considering a shakeup of its alternative-investing units as part of a plan to simplify the bank's strategy\n\nBut with less money under management, particularly in private equity, Goldman often avoided the largest deals (an exception was when it raised a $20 billion fund just before the crisis) or sought coinvestments. The Volcker Rule caps how much the firm can use its own money for such investing. And a real-estate business treated more favorably under post-crisis banking regulations ran aground during the financial crisis, undercutting what could have grown into a larger competitor to Blackstone.\n\nHundreds of billions in 'dry powder'\n\nGoldman's fundraising is expected to add the kind of firepower that would make it more active in going after the larger deals in which Blackstone and a few others have enjoyed success. Julian Salisbury, a partner trusted by Solomon for his investing views, now oversees a real-estate business seen internally as an attractive growth opportunity.\n\nBy some measures, Goldman's push couldn't have come at a more unwelcome time for the private-equity industry. Investors are pouring money into private markets and competition is already fierce.\n\nAs much as $500 billion to $600 billion of \"dry powder\" \u2014 or unused money raised from investors \u2014 has already been amassed in the US alone, according to Cambridge Associates, an adviser to institutional investors. Adding another deep-pocketed investor to compete for multibillion-dollar deals adds yet another challenge to deploying capital.\n\n\"One of the competitive advantages the larger private equity firms believe in and tout is that because they have access to larger pools of capital, both themselves and their LPs, they can be competitive in a certain size bracket of the market where the preponderance of firms cannot,\" according to one banker who works with Blackstone and asked for anonymity to preserve relationships. The banker added that there was only a handful of firms that could write massive checks. \"And so, if Goldman Sachs is another entrant into that party, then yes, no one is going to welcome them in.\"\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs execs are jockeying for control of the firm's lucrative private investing units after a plan to merge it \u2014 and the stakes couldn't be higher\n\nA history of conflict\n\nIn the past few months, Blackstone has also gone after some of Goldman's top talent, according to people with knowledge of its strategy. The private-equity behemoth had its eye on a half dozen or so Goldman employees and succeeded in poaching one \u2014 Dan Oneglia for distressed-debt trading \u2014 before a senior Goldman exec intervened to ask Blackstone to back off, one of the people said.\n\nThe detente occurred even though Goldman sought to head off any conflict with Blackstone, according to people with knowledge of their efforts. In one instance, a Goldman banker called a Blackstone exec to give them a heads up about the coming strategy announcement and ease any fears they might have about the bank's plans, one of the people said.\n\nAs two of Wall Street's most powerful firms, the companies have a history of conflict. Last year, they locked horns after finding themselves on opposite sides of a credit-default-swap trade related to the homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises. The disagreement got to a level where it was a conversation topic at a March 2018 lunch between Blackstone President Jon Gray and then-Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Bloomberg reported last year. Two months later, Blackstone bought a big chunk of Goldman's position to help the investment bank exit most of its trade.\n\nRead more: Meet the Goldman Sachs execs tasked with building the firms' new Blackstone-esque private-investing unit \u2014 and pumping up the bank's flagging stock price\n\nMore broadly, there's a rich history of conflict between investment banks and their clients. In 2004, buyout funds complained when JPMorgan Partners and Credit Suisse's merchant-banking arm beat out KKR and Blackstone for the pharmaceutical company Warner Chilcott in what The Wall Street Journal called a \"hotly contested auction.\" In 2005, Goldman advised the New York Stock Exchange in its merger with Archipelago Holdings despite owning a big stake in Archipelago. And in 2012, Goldman advised the pipeline company El Paso Corp. in its roughly $23 billion takeover by Kinder Morgan Inc. despite holding a big stake in the energy company.\n\nWith highly lucrative fees at risk, JPMorgan spun out its buyout arm, while Credit Suisse shrunk its ambitions.
