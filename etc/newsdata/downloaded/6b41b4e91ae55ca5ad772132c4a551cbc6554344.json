Instead of trashing McGregor or throwing shade, he lit up a candle, asking \u201cThe Notorious\u201d to make a miracle happen.\n\n\u201cSt. McGregor \u201d @thenotoriousmma make me the miracle. .\n\nThe miracle of facing the biggest fans in this world. .\n\nMexico \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd vs Ireland \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea\n\n.\n\n\u201cSan McGregor\u201d @thenotoriousmma hazme el milagro. .\n\nEl milagro de enfrentar a los m\u00e1s grandes fans de este mundo.\n\n.\n\nMexico \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd vs Irlanda \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea .\n\n#145lbs #155lbs #catchweight.\u201d\n\nMcGregor alluded to a Jan. 18 return, and has not competed since his fourth-round submission loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov in 2018 at UFC 229. He mapped out his plans in recent interviews with Russian media, saying he\u2019d like to fight in January, then face the winner of this Saturday\u2019s \u201cBMF\u201d title fight between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz, which he then hopes would lead to a rematch with Nurmagomedov.\n\nRodriguez was able to close the chapter on his rivalry with Jeremy Stephens, defeating him by unanimous decision at UFC on ESPN 6 in Boston. While featherweight contender Rodriguez did say he\u2019d be open to fighting McGregor in either a lightweight or catchweight bout, it\u2019s highly unlikely that he is on McGregor\u2019s radar.\n\nI guess it was worth a try.\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
