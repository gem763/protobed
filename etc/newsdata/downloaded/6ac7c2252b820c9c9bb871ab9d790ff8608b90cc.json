The data-center market is where semiconductor companies have most notably struggled after years of gains, but AMD is finding growth there now while competitors head down the other side of that mountain.\n\nThe earnings news: AMD reports highest revenue in more than a decade\n\n\u201cIn server, we had our highest quarterly CPU revenue since 2006 as strong second-generation Epyc processor demand drove a greater than 50% sequential increase in unit shipments and revenue,\u201d AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su said on a conference call.\n\nPersonal computers also benefited from AMD\u2019s new architecture, developed under Su\u2019s stewardship of a company that was largely known for big ambitions that led to failed runs at Intel Corp. INTC, -0.74% before she arrived. Sales in the computing and graphics business jumped 36% year-over-year to the highest total in that segment since 2011, as the PC market gets a boost from the coming death of Microsoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT, -0.94% Windows 7 operating system.\n\nAMD\u2019s strong growth in those businesses is being offset by a decline in its custom business, where it develops custom chips for videogame-console makers, but that appears temporary. While AMD said revenue from that segment was down 27% and expected to soften further, that is because it is ramping up to service new consoles that Microsoft and Sony Corp. SNE, +0.30% are planning to launch next year.\n\nMore from Therese: Why AMD believes it can challenge Intel in servers\n\nWith AMD\u2019s strongest performance in years across multiple segments, and a windfall potentially waiting next year from the new Xbox and PlayStation models, investors should be celebrating. It appears even more was expected, though, after a huge run-up in the stock price: AMD shares are up almost 79% in 2019, the third-best gain in the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% . Shares bounced around in late trading, eventually ending the session down about 1%.\n\nThe fears appeared to be focused on AMD\u2019s holiday-season guidance and its record-high gross margins, which analysts hoped would be even better. AMD\u2019s fourth-quarter forecast calls for sales of $2 billion to $2.15 billion, barely touching the consensus estimate of $2.15 billion, while margins were mentioned more than a dozen times in the question-and-answer session of the conference call.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m just surprised not to see them up more both in the quarter as well as in the Q4 [forecast],\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst, reflecting a dominant theme.\n\nSee also: Intel suggests the chip recovery is here, even as rivals are still waiting\n\nAMD\u2019s gross margins were 43% of total revenue in the third quarter, up from around 41% sequentially, and the company is forecasting margins of around 44% in the fourth quarter. AMD executives noted that the company\u2019s current product mix still includes its older, less profitable products, which is dragging on margins somewhat.\n\n\u201cYou have to look at the mix of the product relative to the total revenue of the company,\u201d said AMD Chief Financial Officer Devinder Kumar.\n\nInstead of looking for warts, though, Wall Street should step back and appreciate the great strides AMD has made with its new product lines after five years with Su in charge.
