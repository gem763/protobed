The board has been packed with the same Catholic school teachers for the past decade or so, including the principal of a Victorian primary school.\n\nMaritime Super is chaired by Paddy Crumlin, the national secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia since 2000. On the waterfront, Crumlin is a lion. In the boardroom, he seems to be a mouse.\n\nOver five years, Maritime Super operated the worst fund, Chant West says, a performance that punished the presumably oblivious cooks, deck hands, stevedores and others relying on their union's super fund to provide them comfortable retirements.\n\nIn a free market, super funds would be punished for failure by losing customers. Australian funds are spared this discipline by the industrial relations system, which ushers employees into union-controlled funds without providing any information about their performance or better options.\n\nIn Victoria, for example, the teachers at Catholic schools are automatically signed up to Catholic Super if they don't choose an alternate fund within two weeks of being hired. If any teacher is unhappy, they have to a wait a year to change.\n\nThe reasons behind any individual fund's success or failure are inevitably complex, and can be difficult to understand from outside.\n\nIn recent years Maritime Super has invested conservatively to protect its many older investors, who have or will soon retire and don't want their savings gambled on the US share market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaritime Super's chief executive officer, Peter Robertson, acknowledges the strategy has hurt young people who joined the industry and are automatically allocated the worst-performing fund available.\n\n\"In the short term, yes,\" he says. \"But we have to look at the best interests of all members.\"\n\nWhy do Victorian Catholic school teachers need their own retirement fund? What's so specific about the financial needs of deckhands?\n\nMany industry funds produce exceptional returns, including AustralianSuper, HostPlus and UniSuper. Many retail funds are duds. Catholic Super's \"moderately aggressive\" fund - not named after the church's previous leadership - has beaten most of the competition over the past five years. Casey quite rightly advises against investing for the short term. The fund is merging with Equipsuper too.\n\nNonetheless, the historical structure of the union movement, which represents some 10 per cent of the priate sector workforce, is having a bizarre and deleterious effect on the wealth of millions of Australians.\n\nMaritime Super chairman Paddy Crumlin speaks at a Labor Party conference in 2018. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nA confusing amount of choice, limited information and barriers to switching shields the industry from badly needed competition.\n\nNeither Catholic Super, which is responsible for $9.5 billion, nor Maritime Super, which oversees $6 billion, include standard investment benchmarks in their annual reports that would allow investors to assess how good their returns are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next 12 months is crucial to the future of the super system. A lot of attention is on the retirement incomes review initiated a week ago. But as a research exercise, it will not make recommendations to the federal government.\n\nThe review is an opportunity for the $2.7 trillion retirement eco-system to reach collective agreement about what works and doesn't work.\n\nIn a more rational world the worst-performing two thirds of super funds would go out of business or be absorbed by better rivals. Why do Victorian Catholic school teachers need their own retirement fund? What's so specific about the financial needs of deckhands?\n\nWith a more manageable number of options, systems could be developed to help people starting their careers make informed choices about one of the most important financial decisions of their lives.\n\nThe trigger for change is likely to be the government's response to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into superannuation, which in January grappled with the perennial challenge of industrial favouritism towards industry funds.\n\nIn another year's time, after much debate and angst, the moment may arrive when real choice can come to superannuation.\n\nThat would be truly catholic.", "description": "Two industry funds illustrate why a review of the $2.7 trillion retirement system needs to weed out poor performers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3896%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_245%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f6ace564cf5d335acb87cfd75c0e8dac8fb4ebf", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
