At one point, the president held up a National Hurricane Center (NHC) map from 29 August, displaying the hurricane\u2019s track and intensity.\n\nBizarrely, someone had apparently used a Sharpie, a kind of marker pen, to add a black loop falsely extending the hurricane\u2019s path from Florida to Alabama. It was apparently a belated effort to justify Trump\u2019s previous baseless claim that the latter state could be affected.\n\nThe hamfisted, homespun addition triggered uproar on social media and a frenzy of speculation over whether the president himself, or perhaps some lackey eager to impress, was responsible.\n\nAltering official government weather forecasts is against the law.\n\nTrump denied all knowledge. According to the Washington Post, when he was asked about the doctored map later on Wednesday, Trump said his briefings had included a \u201c95% chance probability\u201d that Alabama would be hit.\n\nAsked if the chart had been drawn on, he insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:50 Aerial footage from Bahamas shows Hurricane Dorian destruction \u2013 video\n\nOver the weekend, as Dorian bore down on and then brutally struck the Bahamas, the president issued a torrent of tweets. One mistakenly warned that Alabama would be impacted, potentially spreading panic.\n\nJust 20 minutes later, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama, tweeted: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is not one to admit he was wrong, whether over crowd sizes or how much of his border wall has been built.\n\nIn his Oval Office remarks, the president argued that on the \u201coriginal chart\u201d, Dorian was going to hit Florida directly \u201cand that would have affected a lot of other states\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut that was the original chart,\u201d he said.\n\nThe original NHC map, showing the probable path of the storm, can still be seen online.\n\nSome saw the episode as the latest in the Trump administration\u2019s war on reality. Bill Kristol, the director of Defending Democracy Together and a conservative critic of Trump, posted sarcastically: \u201cWho among us hasn\u2019t altered a National Hurricane Center forecast with a Sharpie?\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday night, apparently stung by the criticism, Trump tweeted another hurricane map. This one showed numerous, multicoloured lines projecting the path of Dorian. Some of the lines reach into Alabama. The map has a \u201cSouth Florida Water Management District\u201d logo in the bottom corner.\n\nThe president wrote: \u201cThis was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!\u201d\n\nBut the map is dated 28 August at 08.06 EDT. Trump sent his tweet about Alabama on 1 September, by which time forecasts made clear it was not in danger.\n\nThe map also clearly carries the disclaimer: \u201cNHC advisories and county emergency statements supersede this product. This graphic should complement, not replace, NHC discussions.\u201d", "description": "Trump points to map with black loop extending hurricane\u2019s path, after previously tweeting \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that Alabama would be hit", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64e123f3f30dc067ba8fbe9bda875da8b8183962/0_0_3687_2212/master/3687.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94166191b315cf2d619d85fa0dbbb972"}
