REUTERS/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa\n\nNew e-commerce foreign investment rules that took effect in India from February were designed to help small traders by curbing heavy online discounting, but traders have complained that big online retailers use complex business structures to circumvent the rules and continue to burn billions of dollars to offer discounts.\n\nThe issue has become one of the biggest trade irritants between New Delhi and Washington.\n\nAt an open panel discussion on Friday - organized by India\u2019s competition watchdog - the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) reiterated its concerns to Amazon\u2019s senior corporate counsel, Rahul Sundaram, sparking a heated public confrontation. The CAIT represents 500,000 merchants and traders in India.\n\nSundaram said Amazon was abiding by all the rules and does not influence prices of products its website, adding that the company provides growth opportunities to more than 500,000 sellers online.\n\nThe trade body, however, was in no mood to accept Sundaram\u2019s statement.\n\nCAIT\u2019s Praveen Khandelwal pointed out to Sundaram that an air conditioning unit available at 42,000 rupees in the offline retail market was sold for 35,000 rupees on Amazon\u2019s website and asked what \u201cmagic\u201d was used to offer such a discount.\n\nSundaram hit back with a personal example, saying he had once spent half a day once walking around New Delhi markets to buy an air conditioner and managed to secure a discount of 6,000 rupees.\n\n\u201cIt is a factor of the entire retail market that you will get discounts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new rules introduced in February followed complaints from small traders who said that the e-commerce giants used their control over inventory from affiliated vendors to create an unfair marketplace.\n\nIn June the Indian government warned Amazon and Walmart\u2019s (WMT.N) Flipkart that they must ensure compliance with the new regulation, adding that it will not allow deep discounts that affect small shopkeepers.\n\nAt one point during Friday\u2019s discussion, Amazon\u2019s Sundaram said the company\u2019s 57 warehouses in India provide logistics support to small sellers and traders, which served only to rile Khandelwal further.\n\n\u201cWe are not small ... Don\u2019t call us small, please,\u201d came the CAIT representative\u2019s angry retort.", "description": "Amazon.com defended its business strategies in India as it came under fire from a local trader group on Friday over discounted products on the global e-commerce giant's website.", "authors": ["Aditya Kalra", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424436169&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T17J"}
