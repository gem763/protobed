Officials had also been planning to hold longer-distance races during cooler hours, but questions had persisted over whether such steps were enough.\n\nSuffocating humidity and high temperatures at the recent world championship marathon in Doha proved gruelling despite a midnight start.\n\nIt was still 29.09 Celsius with 48.6% humidity at the start of the marathon and nearly a third of the 70 starters failed to reach the finish line, fuelling debate over athletes\u2019 welfare.\n\nTemperatures in Tokyo during July and August, when the city hosts the Olympic and Paralympic Games, commonly exceed 30 degrees Celsius, with high humidity adding to the discomfort.\n\nSapporo\u2019s temperatures during the period are as much as five to six degrees centigrade cooler during the day than in Tokyo, the IOC said.\n\nThe city will also host some Olympic soccer matches.\n\nA woman wearing the yukata, or casual summer kimono, walks past Olympic rings displayed at Nihonbashi district in Tokyo, Japan August 5, 2019.
