The majority of the vehicles were mine-resistant armored vehicles, with a few civilian trucks mixed in. No tanks or Bradley Fighting Vehicles appear to have moved into Syria, though U.S. officials have said they are considering both options in the coming days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe oil-field protection plan calls for several hundreds U.S. troops to return to Syria but \u201cless than a battalion,\u201d U.S. officials said. A battalion in most U.S. units numbers 800 to 1,000 troops.\n\nThe convoy Saturday is the latest move in a whirlwind month for the Pentagon in Syria that began with Turkey telling the United States that it would launch an offensive against Kurdish parts of northern Syria. The White House announced Oct. 6 that it would not stand in the way despite years of the Pentagon partnering with Syrian Kurds on operations against the Islamic State.\n\nTrump decided Oct. 13 to withdraw virtually all 1,000 troops from northern Syria, as the SDF reached an agreement with the Syrian regime for protection. U.S. forces rapidly withdrew from several bases afterward, leaving behind some equipment and even using F-15 jets to bomb one of their former headquarters to render it unusable by anyone else.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump was persuaded to move some U.S. troops back into a section of eastern Syria stretching from Hasakah south to Deir al-Zour, farther from the border with Turkey. U.S. officials have said that the new mission around the oil fields there will prevent the Islamic State from capturing them but also allow the Pentagon to continue carrying out counterterrorism operations on the militant group and maintain control of the airspace overhead.\n\nThe U.S. presence also will make it more difficult for the Syrian regime or Russian forces aligned with them from seizing the oil fields.\n\nIn Moscow, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry denounced the U.S. troop movements into eastern Syria on Saturday. Earlier this week, Russia added about 300 military police to its contingent in northern Syria to help patrol a region along the Turkish border.\n\n\u201cWhat Washington is doing now, the seizure and control of oil fields in eastern Syria under its armed control, is, quite simply, international state banditry,\u201d said Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, according to media reports.\n\nBrian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The movement of forces comes after days of President Trump said he wants to protect the oil fields from the Islamic State.", "authors": ["Dan Lamothe", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "The U.S. Military"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wRHvfZOx56W1QnY4XdDNHBO5eik=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G2JJEZHYA4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
