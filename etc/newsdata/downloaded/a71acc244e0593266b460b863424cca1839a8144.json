At least one death was attributed to the fire, a man who authorities said suffered a heart attack while trying to battle encroaching flames.\n\nShepard Smith exits Fox News after 23 years\n\nShepard Smith, chief news anchor and breaking new managing editor at Fox, will leave the network, Fox News Media said on Friday. \"Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News. After requesting that I stay, they obliged. Under our agreement, I won't be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future,\" Smith said on his Friday show.\n\nIn California, food spoils, businesses close as power outages imposed\n\nA California dentist canceled dozens of appointments and supermarkets tried to save rotting food on Thursday as electricity was cut to over 600,000 homes and workplaces in a second day of planned power outages to cut wildfire risks.

In a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, Trump said there was \"broad bipartisan agreement, for decades if not centuries, that a sitting president cannot be subjected to criminal process.\"\n\nIndicted Giuliani associate worked on behalf of Ukrainian oligarch Firtash\n\nOne of the two Florida businessmen who helped U.S. President Donald Trump's personal attorney investigate his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, also has been working for the legal team of a Ukrainian oligarch who faces bribery charges in the United States, according to attorneys for the businessmen and the oligarch.

It will ban California from incarcerating anyone in privately-run facilities altogether from 2028.\n\nJudge blocks Trump immigration rule, calls it 'repugnant to American Dream'\n\nA U.S. federal judge in New York on Friday temporarily blocked a Trump administration rule that would deny residency to aspiring immigrants deemed likely to require government assistance, calling it \"repugnant to the American Dream.\" The rule, finalized in August, vastly expanded who could be considered a possible \"public charge,\" applying to anyone who might in the future need temporary government help such as food stamps, Medicaid or housing aid.
