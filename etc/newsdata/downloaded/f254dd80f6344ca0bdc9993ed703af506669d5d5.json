A vibration feature engages when users inhale a designated amount of the drug.\n\nWhile dosist\u2019s CEO Gunner Winston says he prefers it to be considered a wellness company, transcending the cannabis industry, cannabis is distinctly what makes dosist\u2019s inclusion in LinkedIn\u2019s hottest startups so indicative of shifting employment trends.\n\n\u2018The most compelling thing we look at\u2019\n\nLinkedIn identifies top startups by setting criteria for companies under consideration, then examining actions taken by its 645 million members in relation to those companies.\n\nYoung man holding and vaping an electronic cigarette, e-cig, ecigarette.

LinkedIn identifies top talent as employees who leave positions at companies on its Top Companies list of large established and publicly traded companies. \u201cWhen we see people going from those companies to these startups, we think that that is a very strong sign that these startups are promising.\u201d LinkedIn\u2019s 2019 list includes Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM) and Deloitte.\n\nHiring and hiring at a quick pace also plays a central role in LinkedIn\u2019s startup rankings, which benefited dosist. The company added a large number of its staff over the past year, and according to its LinkedIn profile, it currently has more than 200 employees and is hiring for more than 20 positions.\n\nAsked why a cannabis company had not made the top 50 in past years, Hempel said it could be a reflection of differences in cannabis companies\u2019 approach to hiring.\n\nSource: LinkedIn More\n\nStory continues", "description": "Among all startups in the U.S., a staggering percentage of LinkedIn members want to work for a three-year-old California cannabis company.", "authors": ["Alexis Keenan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_4SE3_TModV4i7ExaSqlXw--~B/aD0yMjMwO3c9MzEzODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/b75df260-29ce-11e9-b3fc-1ee7f4e6d1dc"}
