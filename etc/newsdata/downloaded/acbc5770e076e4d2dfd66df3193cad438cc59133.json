I\u2019m a son now. Son of God. I\u2019m free through to Christ\u201d\n\nKanye West made clear his commitment to Christianity throughout his extensive interview, telling Lowe that he\u2019s no longer an \u201centertainer\u201d but more of a \u201cChristian innovator.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m in service to Christ, my job is to spread the gospel, to let people know what Jesus has done for me,\u201d West explained. \u201cI\u2019ve spread a lot of things. There was a time I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me. I was letting you know what the Hennessy had done for me. I was letting you know all these things but now I\u2019m letting you know what Jesus has done for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in that, I\u2019m no longer I\u2019m no longer a slave,\u201d West continued. \u201cI\u2019m a son now. Son of God. I\u2019m free through Christ.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\nWhen you\u2019re not serving God, you\u2019re serving everyone else. You\u2019re serving your ego, you\u2019re serving your bank account; you\u2019re serving your wife and kids, yes that is a good thing. Serving your management or the people that you\u2019re managing. You\u2019re serving Hollywood, you\u2019re serving your reputation. You\u2019re serving the responsibility of your race.\n\n2. \u201cThere will be a time when I will be the president of the U.S.\u201d\n\nSome historical context: Three years ago Kanye West was millions in debt. He reached out to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and asked him for a $1 billion investment. Fast forward, West is head of a multi-billion dollar fashion empire, he\u2019s calling Twitter boss Jack Dorsey his \u201cfavorite founder,\u201d and says he will \u201calways remember every meeting and interaction I\u2019ve had with Jack Dorsey and I will always remember my meetings and interactions with Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and they\u2019ve been completely different.\u201d\n\nWest told Zane Lowe, \u201cThere will be a time when I will be president of the United States and I will remember \u2014 I will forgive but I will remember \u2014 any founder that didn\u2019t have the capacity to understand culturally what we were doing.\u201d\n\nAsked if 2024 was the year he could announce his candidacy, West said \u201cWe\u2019re working on it.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cWe\u2019re living at an age where someone could be fired for what they think if they say it out loud.\u201d\n\nKanye West called out cancel culture, in which a politically incorrect comment someone makes is taken and used by leftist social media activists as a means to smear and get that person banned, blacklisted, boycotted, or fired.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the age \u2026 Wake up! This is 2019. This is where we are at right now. This is what Dave Chappelle\u2019s whole point was,\u201d West said of his longtime friend\u2019s seminal standup special, in which Chappelle destroyed the woke left and their penchant for finding a way to be offended by everything.\n\n\u201cStop chilling the art,\u201d West continued. \u201cThe artists are supposed to express themselves to be able to have that eternal three-year-old at all costs. People say \u2018oh this is going to kill your brand.\u2019 But my brand is expressing how I feel, whether it\u2019s in line with what you thought the brand was even two days ago. A smart man has the right to pivot and say I think something different now. I don\u2019t think this because this is what the culture thinks.\u201d\n\n4. Wearing the MAGA had liberals losing their minds: It \u201cwas God\u2019s practical joke to all liberals.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the greatest artist in human existence to put a red hat on was God\u2019s practical joke to all liberals. Like, \u2018No! Not Kanye!'\u201d West said before calling out liberals who only screamed about social problems instead of doing the work to address serious issues.\n\n\u201cLiberals never stood in front of the prison\u2019s to stop their from being one and three [black men] locked up or the system,\u201d said West, whose wife Kim Kardashian West spearheaded an effort that eventually became the First Step Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law last year. The measure offers reduced sentences for some federal convicts through their involvement in job and skills training programs.\n\n5. Social media is \u201cthe modern-day cigarettes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith social media people are brainwashed, people are addicted to it,\u201d West later lamented. \u201cPeople invest more into a photo on social media than they invest into real life. One of the reasons why I came to this ranch is to get outside.\u201d\n\nKanye West continued and addressed the overwhelming pressure people (especially women) feel to produce a positive presentation of themselves on social media and how that behavior creates addiction (similar to cigarettes) and anxiety for men and women:\n\nI\u2019m just giving you a flat opinion on what I currently see and what I feel and the pain that I have in my life. I suffer. I suffer and I appreciate the suffering because if we could just \u2026 if we can just feel a little bit of what Jesus felt when we suffer. But social media makes me suffer. I suffer from that and by me saying this out loud, I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s other married men that suffer in a similar way that are happy to hear me say \u2018oh yeah I\u2019m suffering.\u2019\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nJerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the bestselling book 50 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to Know.
