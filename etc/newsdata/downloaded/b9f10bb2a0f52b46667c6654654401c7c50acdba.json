Marcin Lewandowski set a Polish record to claim bronze.\n\nCheruiyot, also a silver medallist at the African Games and Commonwealth Games last year, said he took the initiative to avoid being jostled.\n\n\u201cYou see that there is a lot of pushing so we were trying to avoid the challenges,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cI felt the support of Kenyans in the crowd and it was amazing. The Olympic season is coming so I need to work harder.\u201d\n\nWith Elijah Manangoi unable to defend his title after injuring an ankle in training, fellow Kenyan Cheruiyot was left as the clear favourite thanks to his devastating form this season which included a world leading time in Lausanne.\n\nCheruiyot, cheered on by a sizeable Kenyan contingent in a full house at the air-conditioned Khalifa stadium, took the lead from the gun and broke away along with compatriot Ronald Kwemoi.\n\nHe ran 55 seconds for the first 400m and 1:51 for 800, a risky move late in a season which has seen him run a succession of fast times in the Diamond League.\n\nStill, he kept ramping up the pace, moved away from Kwemoi with 600m left and established a clear lead at the bell which he never looked like relinquishing.\n\nMakhloufi, silver medallist at the 2016 Rio Olympics, led the chase around the final lap and held off Lewandowski, Norway\u2019s 19-year-old European champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen and British pair Jake Wightman and Josh Kerr to claim his first world championship medal.\n\nOlympic champion Matt Centrowitz of the United States was eighth.", "description": "Kenyan Timothy Cheruiyot outclassed a field including two Olympic champions to win the men's 1,500 metres at the world championships on Sunday after taking silver two years ago.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437983303&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960CT-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
