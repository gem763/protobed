It has a majority of minus 45, a 100 per cent record of defeat in the Commons and is seeking a general election which will end the parliamentary session the Queen is about to open.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Johnson is using the Queen to deliver a pre-election party political broadcast for the Conservative Party.\u201d\n\nHis remarks echo those of constitutional experts who issued similar warnings just last week when Downing Street announced parliament would be suspended to pave way for a Queen\u2019s Speech on 14 October.\n\nOn an election, Mr Corbyn will claim the prime minister is \u201cpretending that Labour doesn\u2019t want one\u201d, adding: \u201cSo let me address this directly: prime minister, we can\u2019t trust you not to break the law because you\u2019ve got form.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s simple: obey the law, take no deal off the table and then let\u2019s have the election. We\u2019re ready and champing at the bit. There\u2019s only one reason this hasn\u2019t happened yet \u2013 we can trust you.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Northampton, Mr Corbyn is also expected to showcase a \u201cpreview\u201d of Labour\u2019s next manifesto for government, which he will claim is the \u201cmost radical, hopeful, people-focused programme in modern times\u201d.\n\nHe will highlight his party\u2019s commitments to ban fracking, scrap tuition fees, end rough sleeping in Britain, and hold a second referendum on Brexit within six months a Labour government being formed.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn is set to accuse Boris Johnson of \u201cusing the Queen\u201d for a pre-election Conservative Party broadcast just weeks ahead of a potential general election.
