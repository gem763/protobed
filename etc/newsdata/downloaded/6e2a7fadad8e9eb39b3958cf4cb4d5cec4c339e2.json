The project has sent shockwaves throughout the financial world as regulators and policymakers grapple with how the current system can deal with the rise of a digital currency from a powerhouse like Facebook, which has over 2 billion users worldwide.\n\n\"We\u2019ll have hearings, we\u2019re going to continue to have investigations, we\u2019re going to get Zuckerberg here,\" Waters told The Hill in July, shortly after Facebook sent top Libra executive David Marcus to testify on the project in a pair of testy Capitol Hill hearings.\n\n\"Facebook is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that is intended to rival the U.S. dollar,\" Waters said during her opening remarks at the hearing. \"Facebook\u2019s plans raise serious privacy, trading, national security and monetary policy concerns, not only for Facebook\u2019s over 2 billion users, who will have immediate access to these products, but also for consumers, investors and the global economy.\"\n\nBipartisan lawmakers in both chambers have been raising serious concerns over Facebook's plans to launch the Libra coin, claiming the Switzerland-based project could be abused for terrorist financing and money laundering purposes.\n\nOver the summer, Waters led a congressional delegation to Switzerland, Germany, Cyprus and Qatar, in part to learn more about Facebook's plans.\n\nThe delegation met with key financial regulators in Switzerland, including those who will likely be tasked with regulating the Libra Association, the Swiss nonprofit that Facebook says will oversee Libra's launch, over the next few years.\n\n\u201cAfter the last hearing my colleagues and I were left with more questions than answers,\" Rep.

But testimony before the Financial Services Committee would mark the first time Zuckerberg has come before Congress publicly since widely watched hearings in 2018 that followed the Cambridge Analytica scandal.", "description": "The House Financial Services Committee\u00a0is turning up the heat as lawmakers push\u00a0Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify publicly about the company's\u00a0plans to launch a new digital currency this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/zuckerbergmark_091919as_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
