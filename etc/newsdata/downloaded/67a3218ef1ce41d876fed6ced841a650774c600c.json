The texts make it clear that a quid pro quo of the release of suspended defense aid in exchange for a Ukraine commitment to investigations was an idea that was at least under active consideration. It is notable, though, that Volker\u2019s opening statement in his deposition minimizes any impropriety. Clearly, complete transparency \u2014 the congressional release of Volker\u2019s full deposition and all future depositions, to match the White House\u2019s release of the call transcript and whistleblower complaint \u2014 is the only way the public can review the entirety of the factual record.\n\nPresident Trump has reacted to the controversy by, as is his wont, filling the airwaves and Twitter timelines with haymaker counterpunches and wild charges. Much of this hasn\u2019t been helpful to his cause and has been unworthy of his office. The president shouldn\u2019t troll the press and his domestic opponents with theatrical calls for China to investigate the Bidens, nor should he ridiculously accuse his critics of treason. Utah senator Mitt Romney\u2019s denunciations of Trump\u2019s statements are sincere and shouldn\u2019t be met with presidential abuse and derision. Trump always acts like he\u2019s one of his own surrogates and, in this case, has often sounded like one of his anonymous supporters on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is that, absent some radical change in the dynamic, the House is inevitably going to impeach Trump and the Senate is inevitably going to acquit him. What we\u2019re essentially arguing about is how this impeachment and acquittal will be regarded in the run-up to 2020 by independents and persuadable voters. The president \u2014 if he\u2019s capable of it \u2014 should pitch his defense to those voters, with the understanding that, from his perspective, the best revenge would be making himself the first president to be impeached and reelected.", "description": "Absent some radical change in the dynamic, the House is inevitably going to impeach Trump and the Senate is inevitably going to acquit him.
