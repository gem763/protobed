The plan would also provide insurance to everyone, reducing the number of uninsured from 32.2 million people to zero, the study found.\n\nThe study looked at a range of proposed health care plans as Democratic presidential candidates clash over whether over whether to embrace full-scale single-payer.

For example, a plan that provides a government-run option plus generous government subsidies to help people buy insurance, along the lines of the Biden and Buttigieg plans, would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years, much less than full-scale Medicare for All, the study found. The proposal would reduce the number of uninsured from 32.2 million to 6.6 million people. All of the remaining uninsured would be people in the country illegally.\n\nThat proposal would not eliminate premiums and deductibles, though.\n\nThe study did not look at which taxes would have to be raised to pay for the plans or who the new tax burden would fall on.\n\nOne of the central debates is whether middle-class people would end up saving money under Medicare for All. Proponents like Warren argue that the elimination of premiums and deductibles could balance out the higher taxes.\n\nThe study also examined a single-payer \u201clite\u201d proposal, that would provide less benefits and require some out-of-pocket costs from enrollees, while also not covering people in the country illegally.\n\nThat scaled-back plan would cost $15.6 trillion over 10 years, about half of the full-scale plan, while providing insurance to everyone in the country legally.\n\nThe \u201clite\u201d proposal would also reduce total U.S. spending on health care by about 6 percent, thanks to lower payments to doctors and hospitals, while the full-scale single-payer proposal would increase total U.S. health care spending by about 20 percent, due in large part to more people gaining coverage and using health care.", "description": "A new study finds that a full-scale single-payer health insurance program, also called \"Medicare for All,\" would cost about $32 trillion over 10 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/doctor_patient.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
