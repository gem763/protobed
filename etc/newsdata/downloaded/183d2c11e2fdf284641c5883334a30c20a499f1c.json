Immigration. Guns. Abortion. Religion. Executive power. Pirates, even. That's the menu so far for the Supreme Court's new term, which Monday begins an extended run through much of the 2020 election season. Before the justices adjourn next June, their influence will be felt by tens of millions of Americans, including President Trump and Congress. Democrats' demands for documents and testimony pertaining to the president's personal and business finances already were working their way through lower courts when Trump's dealings with Ukraine turned the buzz in the nation's capital to impeachment. All of those skirmishes will produce battles over congressional subpoenas and administration claims of executive privilege.\n\nCLOSE Chief Justice John Roberts is doing all in his power to help the Supreme Court not look overtly political as it moves ideologically to the right. USA TODAY\n\nMLB Playoffs: Astros, Yankees eye first-round sweeps\n\nThe top two teams in the American League have asserted their dominance thus far. The Houston Astros and New York Yankees, coming off 100-win regular-season campaigns, have each taken 2-0 series leads and can cap off the sweeps on Monday. Astros starting pitcher Zack Greinke takes aim at a Tampa Bay Rays lineup that was throttled by stars Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole in Games 1 and 2 of the series. Meanwhile, the Yankees travel to Minnesota with hopes of ending the Twins' season after the Bronx Bombers put up a combined 18 runs in the first two games of the series.\n\n'Joker' gets last laugh with record ticket sales\n\nFinal numbers are expected Monday for the supremely dark new movie, \"Joker,\" which grossed an estimated $93.5 million in ticket sales over the weekend \u2014 a record October opening \u2014 despite concerns over its violent themes and ramped-up theater security. The previous October record-holder was the Spider-Man spinoff \"Venom,\" which opened to $80 million last year. Internationally, \"Joker\" earned $140.5 million from 73 markets, resulting in a stunning $234 million global debut.\n\nArthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) cares for his mom Penny (Frances Conroy) in \"Joker.\" (Photo: NIKO TAVERNISE)\n\nPig out!
