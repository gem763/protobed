And at the center of it\u2014me, an inadvertent thief.\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019m embarrassed to admit now that my first inclination was borderline madness \u2014 to print out \u201cFound\u201d signs with news of my discovery and my cellphone number, and paper them all over Metro Center. But I decided that was a bad idea for a number of reasons, including that WMATA might not look kindly on such behavior.\n\nAD\n\nMETRO RED LINE PSA: To the woman who lost her left Airpod...You were searching for it on the floor of train; got off at Metro Center (I think?); I got to work and found it in the side pocket of my backpack...V SORRY! DM if it's yours... \u2014 Ashley Parker (@AshleyRParker) October 7, 2019\n\nSo I went with a long shot, and sent out a tweet. \u201cMETRO RED LINE PSA: To the woman who lost her left AirPod,\u201d I wrote. \u201cYou were searching for it on the floor of the train; got off at Metro Center (I think?); I got to work and found it in the side pocket of my backpack\u2026. V SORRY! DM if it\u2019s yours\u2026\u201d\n\nIt was a Craigslist Missed Connection, for the Twitter age.\n\nAD\n\nIf she was anything like me, I reasoned, she would have shown up at work and promptly told every single person within earshot about her terrible, horrible, no good, very bad morning. And I figured the demographic universe of people who ride the Metro, work downtown, and either read The Washington Post\u2014where I am a White House reporter\u2014or have a friend who reads The Washington Post was enough of an overlapping Venn diagram that maybe, somehow, my tweet might reach her.\n\nAD\n\nWithin hours, it had.\n\nThe Twitter forces were benevolent, and the two tweets I sent out about the missing ear bud were retweeted more than 1,700 times. A friend of hers from work happened to see my tweet, remember her story of losing an AirPod on her morning commute, and put us in touch.\n\nAD\n\nVasilisa \u2014 \u201cLisa\u201d for short \u2014 is 24-years-old, originally from Portland, Oregon, and currently getting her Masters in Public Policy at Georgetown University. She is also interning at the Center for American Progress in K-12 education policy, and it was there she was heading Monday morning when her ear bud fell from her ear and into my bag.\n\nOn Thursday, we finally met in person downtown, where I returned her missing ear twin and she bought me a cup of coffee. She was lovely and appreciative, and I was delighted that my lark of a tweet had resulted in a happy ending. (We also took a selfie, obviously, which I tweeted out to close the loop).\n\nAD\n\nTo conclude: THE MYSTERY WOMAN (@smith_vasilisa) HAS BEEN REUNITED W HER EARBUD! She was not on Twitter, but a colleague saw the tweet, flagged it for her, and put us in touch. Today I returned the missing twin (\ud83c\udfa7) and she bought me coffee (\u2615\ufe0f). #huzzah As you were... https://t.co/5gOgfzPPDL pic.twitter.com/QMvjhlHOB4 \u2014 Ashley Parker (@AshleyRParker) October 10, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a natural lesson or takeaway, nor does there necessarily need to be. But it was heartening to think that social media \u2014 of which I am a begrudging if frequent user\u2014 had resulted in an actual, non-catastrophic human connection. And I was reminded yet again of how, for better or worse, D.C. really can be a small town \u2014 and this time, I\u2019d argue, for better.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "It wasn\u2019t until I got to my desk and began unpacking my backpack that I noticed a lone left ear bud in one of my bag\u2019s side pockets.
