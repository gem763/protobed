That eventually creates higher wages and, in turn, a more productive economy.\n\nTo support her theory, one of many outlined in her recently published book, Bateman zooms out to before the Industrial Revolution, when women in Europe had \u201csignificantly greater freedoms\u201d than those in other parts of the world. They could choose who and when to marry, inherit property and work. That, Bateman argues, let European economies surpass economies in China, India and the Middle East, where women weren\u2019t as free.\n\nSome economists say Bateman\u2019s view might be too simplistic. Gender inequality, they argue, stems from unfair trade policies between the West and developing countries, inadequate government institutions and a complex chain of other factors.\n\nBut, according to Bateman, this kind of discussion is often ignored within economics, a field in which the concepts of feminism and women\u2019s rights are clumped together as social, political and cultural issues best suited for other disciplines to study.\n\nAnd so she shed her clothes.\n\nA short while into that 2018 conference in Brighton, a naked Bateman did at least partially fulfill her aim: She started conversations about her ideas with fellow economists in the room. That is, until she was thrown out \u2014 an unsurprising turn of events, given the setting, but one that was perhaps the perfect metaphor for her theory.\n\n______\n\nWhat else is happening\n\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.", "description": "The conventional wisdom is that economic growth leads to gender equality.
