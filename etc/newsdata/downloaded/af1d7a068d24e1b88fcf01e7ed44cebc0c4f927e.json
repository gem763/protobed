Of 146 letters sent to the local council, all but one objected to the proposal.\n\nAs the fifth generation of wireless technology, 5G promises to paving the way for everything from self-driving cars to wearable health devices providing round-the-clock monitoring\n\nAnd of those objections, virtually all highlighted concerns about the risks they claim 5G poses to human health.\n\nAmong those opposing the plan are Richard and Myra Bianco, who called for the installation to be blocked until more research was carried out. \u2018So little is known about the effects on human health that it worries me companies are being given the go-ahead to use this technology,\u2019 said Mrs Bianco, 71. \u2018It doesn\u2019t seem right. They should carry out independent tests then install them \u2014 not the other way round.\u2019\n\nAnother letter lodged with the council reads: \u2018The launch of 5G will be similar to turning on your microwave, opening its door, and leaving it on for the rest of your life. These towers are not only dangerous \u2014 they\u2019re lethal!\u2019\n\nA third commented: \u2018My concern is particularly centred with children . . . 5G is 1,500 times stronger than 3G and 4G . . . I urge you to stop this going ahead.\u2019\n\nThose sentiments are not confined to this corner of Britain. This week it emerged that opponents of 5G in Totnes, Devon, have persuaded their council to demand a moratorium on the new network\u2019s installation. Similar steps have been taken in Frome and Glastonbury, across the border in Somerset.\n\nCancer, damage to the nervous system and reduced fertility are the main concerns, with claims that 5G will turn out to be the \u2018asbestos and tobacco\u2019 of the 21st century.\n\nSome online contibutors warn of a 5G \u2018apocalypse\u2019 caused by \u2018dangerous microwaves that destroy living matter\u2019. Humans, birds and insect life are all said to be at imminent risk.\n\nSuch claims are dismissed by the telecommunications industry and the Government. They point out that wireless technology has been in existence for decades, and that previous studies have not concluded the radio waves involved pose any serious health risks.\n\nDespite this, there is a growing sense of frustration that claims to the contrary are gaining traction. In America, it has been reported that the Russians have been amplifying 5G scare stories as part of their cyber-warfare efforts. To this background, last week, digital minister Matt Warman issued a strident defence of the new technology, announcing that the Government would \u2018work to bust health myths\u2019 over 5G.\n\n\u2018There is no credible evidence to back up [these] concerns and huge evidence for the economic benefit of gigabit-capable networks,\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Warman went on to point out that, according to the World Health Organisation, when it comes to radiation, 5G is no more dangerous than \u2018talcum powder or pickled veg\u2019.\n\nFor starters, 5G promises to deliver speeds ten to 100 times faster than current 4G networks. In practice that means you should be able to download a film in less time than it takes to read its description.\n\nProtesters say cancer, damage to the nervous system and reduced fertility are the main concerns, with claims that 5G will turn out to be the \u2018asbestos and tobacco\u2019 of the 21st century\n\nBut improved download speeds are not the only gain. It also offers lower \u2018latency\u2019, or lag, the delay between sending and receiving information. This means that data will be transmitted almost instantaneously.\n\nOn a basic level that is good news for someone interacting with an opponent in an online game.\n\nBut the technology will also pave the way for self-driving cars that will need to \u2018talk\u2019 with one another and interact with the environment.\n\nIt is also expected to facilitate drone deliveries, remote healthcare and emergency response and management.\n\nA third benefit is the number of devices 5G will be able to simultaneously support. If you\u2019ve ever been at a busy railway station or concert, you may have experienced difficulty using a smartphone. That\u2019s because 4G can only cope with 60,000-odd devices in half a square mile. With 5G, that increases to a million.\n\nThe roll-out of 5G for mobile broadband is being undertaken by private network operators EE, O2, Vodafone and Three. The first commercial networks have already gone live in major cities across the United Kingdom.\n\nTo take advantage of 5G, users need to buy a smartphone with a 5G modem. The benefits of 5G are only possible because it operates slightly differently to its predecessors.\n\nAs with current technologies, 5G networks rely on signals carried by radio waves \u2014 transmitted between an antenna or mast and your phone.\n\nBut 5G uses higher frequency radio waves than previous networks, using what is known as the \u2018mid-frequency spectrum\u2019. The higher end of the spectrum will be used in the future to provide other even faster 5G services, including home broadband.\n\nTo install the network, the operators have started by upgrading existing masts and towers. But the higher frequencies used mean the waves travel shorter distances and are more easily blocked by buildings than previous generations.\n\nThis means the telecom companies are having to install more roof-top antennas and equipment. It is these two factors \u2014 the higher frequency waves and the spread of masts and antennas \u2014 that is causing most concern to opponents of 5G.\n\nThis week it emerged that opponents of 5G in Totnes, Devon, have persuaded their council to demand a moratorium on the new network\u2019s installation (stock image)\n\nAmong them is 38-year-old John Kitson. He describes himself as a full-time 5G activist, having quit his job as a recruitment consultant to highlight his worries about the new technology. As well as spearheading the campaign in Totnes, where he lives, he gives talks around the country, recently addressing several hundred delegates at the Ukip conference.\n\nHe first became concerned about the effects of electro-magnetic radiation five years ago following the death of his mother from a brain tumour he believes was linked to her digital cordless home phone. \u2018I came across a couple of articles about mobile phones and wifi and health problems and just started to do a bit more research into it,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Tumours are increasing and it isn\u2019t down to better diagnosis. There is increasing evidence of a link to high-frequency radiation.\u2019 He says that contrary to what health bodies such as the WHO and Public Health England are saying, there is a significant body of scientific evidence that has raised concerns about the existing 3G and 4G networks.\n\nHe says with that background, the paucity of research into 5G is all the more worrying.\n\n\u2018More than 250 scientists have urged the EU to halt the roll-out of 5G because it means a huge increase in electromagnetic radio frequencies on top of the existing network,\u2019 he says. \u2018I don\u2019t want to stop the march of technology. I want it made safe.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a point echoed by another protester from the town, 70-year-old Rosi Gladwell. She claims to be so sensitive to electromagnetic waves that she has to wear a protective hood in locations such as airports where signals are high.\n\n\u2018At the moment, I\u2019ve managed to make myself safe by being fortunate enough to live in a house in the countryside where there are no measured electromagnetic frequencies,\u2019 she says. \u2018But if they introduce 5G then I don\u2019t know what the future will bring. It\u2019s a really scary issue.\u2019\n\nLocal business coach Julie Harrison, 55, adds: \u2018There is evidence that 3G and 4G are not fine. But this is completely different technology.\n\n\u2018The antennas are going to be attached to lampposts. They are going to sit outside children\u2019s bedrooms, for goodness sake. The industry has not done meaningful research.\u2019\n\nPublic Health England denies the new technology poses a risk.\n\nIt says that over the decades, monitoring has shown that exposure of the public to radio waves falls well within the guideline levels used in the UK and Europe and set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection.\n\nIt also says that the higher frequencies being used by 5G have been used by other types of transmitters \u2018for many years\u2019 without problem.\n\nImproved download speeds are not the only gain as 5G also offers lower \u2018latency\u2019, or lag, the delay between sending and receiving information. This means that data will be transmitted almost instantaneously (stock image)\n\nAnd it concludes: \u2018It is possible that there may be a small increase in overall exposure to radio waves when 5G is added to an existing network or in a new area.\n\n\u2018However, the overall exposure is expected to remain low relative to guidelines and, as such, there should be no consequences for public health.\u2019\n\nSuch assurances are unlikely to persuade opponents of 5G.\n\nDr Frank de Vocht, an epidemiologist and public health scientist at Bristol University, warns that protesters do not want to delay the roll-out of 5G \u2014 but to block it altogether.\n\n\u2018You cannot really prove that something is \u201c100 per cent safe\u201d using scientific methods,\u2019 he says. This is because any studies that could be carried out would have to be done on animals or at a cellular level.\n\n\u2018If these were to show no effects, the campaigners\u2019 argument would be to say there is still no evidence in humans,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018So studies on humans should be done, which can\u2019t be done because 5G is not rolled out, nor can you expose people willingly to see if some would get cancer. So campaigners will argue there is no evidence of safety in humans.\u2019\n\nHe adds: \u2018After 30 years of mobile phone use there is little evidence of increased cancer risks as a result of mobile phone use.\n\n\u2018This should be long enough to have found it, had it been there \u2014 for example, for asbestos the risks could be observed after ten to 15 years.\u2019\n\nWhich takes us back to talcum powder. In 2014, the WHO said that \u2018no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use\u2019.\n\nHowever the WHO, together with the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified all radio frequency radiation, of which mobile signals are a part, as \u2018possibly carcinogenic\u2019.\n\nPublic Health England says that over the decades, monitoring has shown that exposure of the public to radio waves falls well within the guideline levels used in the UK and Europe\n\nIt has been put in this category because \u2018there is evidence that falls short of being conclusive that exposure may cause cancer in humans\u2019.\n\nEating pickled vegetables and using talcum powder are classed in the same category.\n\nAlcoholic drinks and processed meat are in a higher category because the evidence is stronger.\n\nEven so, Dr de Vocht denies the siting of new 5G masts and antennas pose a health risk.\n\n\u2018The best way to understand this network is that instead of a concert with a large amount of sound blasted from the podium and people in the front receiving too much noise in order for people at the back to hear \u2014 the current situation \u2014 there would be many small sound systems surrounding the fans, thus needing much less power for everyone to hear the music well,\u2019 he says.\n\nIn other words, lower power levels mean that the level of radiation exposure from 5G antennas will be lower.\n\nIn practical terms, health concerns are unlikely to block the roll-out of 5G infrastructure in the UK in the short term.\n\nWhile town councils may lobby for delays, in reality it is a planning matter.\n\nIn Hove, the request for a new, taller mast was recently turned down by the council. But the authority made it clear that it was not refusing the application on health grounds because the new 5G mast would have been fully compliant with national safety guidelines.\n\nInstead it was turned down for aesthetic reasons \u2014 being \u2018overly dominant and highly visible from nearly every direction\u2019.\n\nWith the Government calling for planning authorities to back the roll-out of 5G, other similar applications across the country are already getting the green light.\n\nInterestingly, a bigger problem facing the roll-out may come from much further afield.\n\nEarlier this year, then-Prime Minister Theresa May faced a backlash after deciding to allow Huawei to build \u2018non-core\u2019 parts of the 5G network.\n\nThe Chinese telecoms giant has been blacklisted in the U.S. amid fears that it poses a security threat.\n\nA final decision on whether to allow Huawei\u2019s involvement now rests in Boris Johnson\u2019s hands.\n\nExperts warn that any decision to block the company would cause serious problems and bring additional costs \u2014 meaning that Britain\u2019s superfast future could still yet face lengthy delays.", "description": "5G promises to change how we live, as well as provide superfast download speeds.
