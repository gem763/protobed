He must like the ignominy of being shouted at by a bloke who, for putting a football team on a pitch, earns a hundred times his salary.\n\nMinimum.\n\nMoss was the fourth official here, the man charged with having his ears burnt by Jurgen Klopp.\n\nBizarrely, he did not seem to mind.\n\nHow else can you explain a grown man putting up with someone snarling in his face?\n\nHe should have told Klopp to shut up or be sent to the stands.\n\nOr maybe he could have suggested the manager concentrate on trying to sort out a Liverpool performance that comfortably ranks as one of their worst in the calendar year.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOK, they were shorn of Mohamed Salah but that still cannot account for a startling sloppiness - in passing, in pressing, in decision-making, in most things.\n\nAfter winning 17 Premier League games on the spin, they are allowed an off-day.\n\nAnd this team is good enough on an off-day to deserve this draw at Old Trafford, to enjoy 68 percent possession, have double the number of United shots on target and, eventually, look like the team far more likely to collect a win.\n\nBut the fact is this was a match they should have been winning in a canter and, instead, they were ragged and, at times, seemed pretty disorganised and unsure of exactly what system they were using.\n\nThat is why any finger-pointing at VAR is faintly ludicrous.\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nCould it have been deemed a foul by Victor Lindelof on Divock Origi as the Liverpool striker\u2019s loss of possession prompted the move that ended with Marcus Rashford\u2019s finish? Of course it could.\n\nBut only \u2018could\u2019.\n\nIt was an incident that split opinion and when there is doubt, maybe it should go to the team that has just swept sixty years forward and scored.\n\nJust as VAR gave the benefit of the doubt to Sadio Mane in the final throes of the recent game against Leicester at Anfield when he collapsed as though he had been electrocuted after the faintest of touches from Marc Albrighton, earning Liverpool a match-winning penalty.\n\nYou know the old adage\u2026 evens itself out and all that.\n\nVAR could as easily have overturned Chris Kavanagh\u2019s decision to award a winning spot-kick to Klopp\u2019s team a fortnight ago just as VAR could have ruled that Atkinson had missed an offence against Origi here.\n\nIt is all pretty meaningless noise.\n\nThe superior team under-performed and the inferior team showed tremendous fight and spirit.\n\nThat is why this scoreline was level.\n\nAnd no matter how much Klopp screamed in Moss\u2019s shell-like, nothing to do with VAR.", "description": "ANDY DUNN: The fourth official copped an earful on more than one occasion - but it wasn't VAR that cost the Reds", "authors": ["Andy Dunn", "Image", "Getty Images", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663162.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
