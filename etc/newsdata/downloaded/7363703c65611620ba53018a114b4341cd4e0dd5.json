The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday will come in the wake of a survey on Tuesday that showed manufacturing contracting for the first time in three years in August. The economy's waning fortunes, underscored by an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, have been largely blamed on the White House's year-long trade war with China. Washington and Beijing slapped fresh tariffs on each other on Sunday. While the two economic giants on Thursday agreed to hold high-level talks in early October in Washington, the uncertainty, which has eroded business confidence, lingers. The economy is also facing headwinds from Britain's potentially disorderly exit from the European Union, and softening growth in China and the rest of the world. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this month to keep the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track. The U.S. central bank lowered borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.\n\nA waiter carries a tray of food to patrons at the Bayside American Cafe in Portland, Oregon. Carl D.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones forecast a slightly lower jobs number at 150,000. The anticipated job gains would be below the monthly average of 165,000 over the last seven months, but still above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.7% for a third straight month. August job growth could, however, fall short of expectations because of a seasonal quirk related to students leaving their summer jobs and returning to school. Over the past several years, the initial August job count has tended to exhibit a weak bias, with revisions subsequently showing strength. Other factors favoring slower job growth include declines in both the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing and services industries employment measures in August. In addition, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported a 37.7% jump in planned job cuts by U.S-based employers in August.\n\nBullish consumers", "description": "Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 150,000 in August, while the unemployment rate was seen holding steady at 3.7%, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert", "Spriha Srivastava"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104979245-GettyImages-669949900.jpg?v=1538768385", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
