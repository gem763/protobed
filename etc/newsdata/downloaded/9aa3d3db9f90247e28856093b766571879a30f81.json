Tuesday night, Strasburg relieved Scherzer for three scoreless innings, and the Nats won the National League wild-card game. Friday night, Scherzer relieved Strasburg \u2014 a brilliant, dominant Strasburg \u2014 with a stompin\u2019-and-spittin\u2019 eighth inning, and the Nats somehow clung to a victory that, without those two right arms, would have certainly slipped away.\n\nSorting this one out could take the length of a cross-country flight, then fill the hours before Sunday\u2019s Game 3, because it included a decision to intentionally walk the tying run in the bottom of the ninth(?)(!!!). But we have learned a truth about these Nationals in this October. Starting pitchers are, by definition, eat-the-same-pregame-meal-and-take-the-same-route-to-the-ballpark creatures of habit. Strasburg and Scherzer are putting that notion on the table, then flipping it over.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is no routine in the postseason,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThere is no routine right now. It\u2019s come to the park ready to compete.\u201d\n\nStrasburg was just that Friday night, the best version of himself. On such occasions, there\u2019s no way to hit his stuff. That he threw 34 pitches in that scoreless stint against Milwaukee three days earlier seemed not to hinder, but rather to inspire. We can tell those tired tales of the hot days when he wilted, recount the times when something seemed slightly off \u2014 a breeze blowing the wrong way, a mound with substandard footing, toast browned 15 seconds too long \u2014 and thus, Strasburg became rattled.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really matured,\u201d said first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, a teammate for the entirety of Strasburg\u2019s 10-year career. \u201cAs a person, as a pitcher, he doesn\u2019t let little things bother him anymore.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStephen Strasburg is the best pitcher in the series. Get him the ball. A lot.\n\nNow? Now he glares. The Dodgers led the N.L. in runs scored, slugging percentage and on-base-plus slugging \u2014 by most measures, the best offense in the league. Strasburg, at times, reduced them to junior varsity backups still awaiting their first shave. He retired the first 14 Dodgers he faced, eight by strikeout.\n\nThe old book on Strasburg has been banned from public schools and libraries, blasphemous as it was. The new one has a lead character who has grown, physically, into a monster who has simultaneously developed his body as he\u2019s mastered his craft. He\u2019s a chemistry professor with a double major in psychology who also happens to power lift.\n\n\u201cI just learned over the years that pressure\u2019s a funny thing, and I think it\u2019s something that you have complete control over,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a lot of expectations, there\u2019s a lot of excitement in games. But I really tried, over the years, to train my mind into thinking that every single game is just as important and just sticking to my approach. I mean, my approach is everything, and the results are one thing, and how I respond to those results is just as important.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is no longer a pitcher who needs to roll his eyes at a call not granted, though he\u2019s not entirely above it. Friday night, he couldn\u2019t believe plate umpire Jordan Baker didn\u2019t ring up A.J. Pollock on a 2-2 fastball in the first. His response back when that old book was written would have been a pitch that missed by half a foot, yet he would have remained the victim. His response Friday: an ungodly curveball that reduced Pollock to a pretzel, and a jog off the mound with only a glance back in Baker\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fun to watch,\u201d Scherzer said, \u201cespecially in these big moments.\u201d\n\nSo after his performance Friday \u2014 six innings, three hits, one run, no walks, 10 strikeouts, 85 pitches three days after setting down the Brewers \u2014 we can present with you Strasburg\u2019s updated postseason resume\u2019: a 0.64 ERA with four walks and 38 strikeouts in 28 innings pitched as batters managed a .190 average against him. Oh, a salient point, given the current state of baseball: The next home run Strasburg allows in the postseason will be the first.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Strasburg tired after six, and lefty Sean Doolittle worked the seventh \u2014 allowing a massive solo homer to Max Muncy \u2014 the bullpen gate swung open, and here came Scherzer. In Thursday\u2019s Game 1, rookie Tanner Rainey and veterans Fernando Rodney and Hunter Strickland turned a 2-0 deficit into a 6-0 laugher, proving yet again they can\u2019t be trusted by Manager Dave Martinez. So the Nationals, with a bullpen that statistically ranked among the worst this century, can\u2019t play this October by conventional norms. Scherzer, Strasburg and the entire team know it.\n\n\u201cFor me,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner said, \u201cit\u2019s you pitch your best guys to win.\u201d\n\nScherzer, coming off a season interrupted by injury, is inarguably one of those. He has the will to do this kind of thing, but it hasn\u2019t always worked out. In the Nationals\u2019 most recent playoff appearance, against the Cubs in 2017, he appeared out of the bullpen in the fifth inning of Game 5. Though he retired two of Chicago\u2019s toughest hitters, Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo, to start the frame, things went haywire from there, and the Nats lost one of the weirdest games you\u2019ll ever see.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut after a pregame discussion with Martinez and the coaching staff Friday, Scherzer said he had an inning in him. Forget that he was supposed to start Sunday.\n\n\u201cFor me, you bring it whenever you\u2019re told to bring it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the playoffs. You lay it on the line every time you touch that field.\u201d\n\nFriday night, there was no Matt Wieters throwing the ball into right field, no catcher\u2019s interference, no hitting a man with the bases loaded \u2014 none of the craziness that marked that Cubs\u2019 loss. There was only Scherzer at his absolute best. He struck out rookie Gavin Lux with a cutter. He struck out Chris Taylor with a slider. He struck out Joc Pederson on three pitches, the last a cutter at which Pederson only flailed.\n\nAD\n\nSo, Scherzer for the ninth, too?\n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI was biting my lip, scratching my head.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nScherzer, though, said he would have been compromised in another inning because he had thrown 77 pitches on Tuesday. The ninth would go to Daniel Hudson.\n\n\u201cHuddy\u2019s our closer,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cLet him close.\u201d\n\nAh, if only it were that simple. The Nats are in this position only because even their two best relievers, Hudson and Doolittle, are worn down and spotty. Leading by two runs, Hudson allowed a leadoff double to Justin Turner, got two outs \u2014 and then Martinez decided to intentionally walk Muncy, bringing the go-ahead run to the plate.\n\nWait. What?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really not much to think about,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nThat seems to be \u2014 how to put this? \u2014 not true. But he\u2019s the manager. Allow him to explain.\n\n\u201cMuncy hit a ball 400 feet against Doo,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t want that to happen. He\u2019s a fastball hitter. We know that. Hudson throws fastballs. So I liked the other matchup.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe problem: The other matchup was Will Smith, and Hudson threw him four straight balls to load the bases.\n\nThere was, then, some stuff going down. Strasburg was done. Scherzer was done. Dodger Stadium pulsed. Zimmerman, a 35-year-old veteran of 15 years, looked over at Ted Barrett, the first base umpire, and said, \u201cWhenever I\u2019m done, this is what I\u2019m going to miss.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t replicate that,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing, once you\u2019re done playing, that\u2019s going to be on any sort of level like that.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in this postseason, thus far, that is on any sort of level like what happened Friday night at Dodger Stadium. That Hudson struck out Corey Seager to end it secured the Nats\u2019 win. What they fly home with, though, is almost as important: The knowledge that their two best pitchers are here to do whatever\u2019s asked, convention be damned.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nJuan Soto is a quick learner.
