Holding a sign that said \u201cHate is not normal,\u201d the protestors repeatedly chanted \u201cwhen children are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back.\u201d\n\nDespite repeated attempts by Doris Meissner, a Migration Policy Institute Senior Fellow and panelist for the speech, to get the protestors to stop and allow MacAleenan to give the address, the activists continued to drown out the speech.\n\n\u201cAs a career law enforcement professional, I\u2019ve dedicated my career to protecting the right to free speech, and all the values we hold dear in America, from all threats,\u201d MacAleenan began, before being cut off for a third time.\n\n\u201cLot to cover today, there\u2019s some very serious issues that we can talk about, in candor, in a real dialogue, or we can continue to shout,\u201d MacAleenan attempted to begin a final time, and spoke for about 30 seconds before being cut off again, after which he thanked the audience and left the stage.\n\nSelee took to Twitter after the incident to voice his displeasure at the situation.\n\nDeeply saddened that protesters decided to interrupt @DHSMcAleenan during his speech at a conf organized by @MigrationPolicy @cliniclegal @GeorgetownLaw. We need to hear from diverse perspectives in a democratic society, and the audience lost the chance to engage w/him on policy. \u2014 Andrew Selee (@SeleeAndrew) October 7, 2019\n\nIn a profile in The Washington Post published on Oct. 1, MacAleenan voiced his qualms about the term \u201cillegal alien,\u201d saying \u201cI think the words matter a lot,\u201d and said the Trump\u2019s child-separation policy was \u201cwell intended\u201d but \u201cwent too far.\u201d", "description": "Despite repeated attempts to get the protestors to stop and allow MacAleenan to give the address, the activists continued to drown out the speech.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
