Mr. Trump renounced the accord more than a year ago, but until four months ago Iran was continuing to comply with all of its major restrictions.\n\nIt was the third time this year that Iran had announced steps to break from those limits, saying it would no longer abide by an agreement that the United States was violating by reimposing sanctions. The accord required all signatories to lift many sanctions on Iran while it was in compliance; the European Union, Russia and China have all continued to honor the agreement, in a split from the Trump administration.", "description": "Details suggest Iran is largely interested in increasing pressure on European nations to find a way around American-imposed sanctions.", "authors": ["David E.
