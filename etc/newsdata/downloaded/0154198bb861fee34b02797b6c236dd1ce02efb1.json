They told the man they were arresting him for being in possession of suspected stolen property.\n\n\"They took him to the police station and told him to go and find R20 000 in cash for his cellular phones to be returned. One of the members gave him a number for him to call once he [had] the money,\" the police said.\n\nThe man managed to get R5 000 and arranged a meeting with the police officers.\n\nHe and a friend were taken to the police station in the central business district and were later allowed to leave without being arrested.\n\n\"The complainant also received an SMS from the number the members provided, claiming R20 000. He called the number and he was told that if he pays the money he will be left alone if the members see him on the street again.\"\n\nThe police officers were appearing in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Wednesday.\n\nActing provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Sindile Mfazi warned that there was no place for corrupt members in the SAPS.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
