We\u2019re here to make it a bit smaller and a bit more manageable. There are a lot of great shows, and each has a lot of great episodes, so we want to highlight the noteworthy and the exceptional. Each week, our crack team of podcast enthusiasts and specialists will pick their favorites.\n\nThe Missing Cryptoqueen, \u201cDr. Ruja\u201d\n\nIn June 2016, an impeccably dressed businesswoman took the stage in front of a massive audience at Wembley Arena in London. Wearing diamonds and her trademark bright-red lipstick, Dr. Ruja Ignatova oozed success as she spoke of a financial revolution that would make them all rich via her brand of cryptocurrency: OneCoin. The crowd ate it up. \u201cShe looked like a queen,\u201d one attendee recalls in the first episode of the new BBC podcast, The Missing Cryptoqueen. Dr. Ruja had millions of followers, host Jamie Bartlett reports, and was one of the richest women in Europe \u2014 a cross between Belle from Beauty and the Beast and Apple founder Steve Jobs. When bitcoin first appeared on an obscure internet forum in 2008, reception was lukewarm. But as big banks behaved badly, cryptocurrency gained momentum and digital currency entrepreneurs like Dr. Ruja entered the scene, promising to take the new digital currency to the next level. In late 2017, Dr. Ruja vanished. Did she meet with foul play or did she play her followers by carrying out what could be the largest cryptocurrency scam of all time? Bartlett sets out to tell the story that, he confides, shocked even him. \u2014Lara Bricker\n\nLet\u2019s Go to Court!, \u201cThe Durable Michael Malloy & a Mother Who Took Justice Into Her Own Hands\u201d\n\nHosted by Brandi Egan and Kristin Caruso \u2014 one went to law school for a year and the other has a single semester of criminal-justice classes, Let\u2019s Go to Court! recorded 87 episodes before getting a mention on a recent episode of My Favorite Murder. LGTC is a comedy podcast about court cases, and not just the murder-y kind (Brandi and Kristen admit to being obsessed with lawsuits in general). In this episode, we learn about some dudes so intent on collecting an insurance policy that they repeatedly try to kill another dude who seems to be truly indestructible (did you know it\u2019s possible to get hit by a car twice and live? Don\u2019t try it). In a much less hilarious case, Kristen and Brandi discuss dumb questions asked on To Catch a Predator, and the case of Ellie and Will Nessler, who, for the worst reasons, got to be on Oprah. If you believe that true crime and comedy can (and must) coexist, and you\u2019re into funny humans and obscure court cases, download the crap out of this one.\n\n\u2014Chanel Dubofsky\n\nMotive, \u201cShooting From a Mercedes\u201d\n\nA lawyer explains that it\u2019s like a horrible sociological experiment: Take a 13-year-old boy from the streets of Chicago, convict him as an adult for a murder that he claims he didn\u2019t commit, release him from prison in his 30s \u2026 and give him $25 million. What happens next? This is the setup described in \u201cA Shooting From a Mercedes,\u201d the opening episode of Motive, a new podcast from WBEZ in Chicago. We are introduced to T.J. Jimenez, the aforementioned 30-year-old, through a viral video of him driving through a West Chicago neighborhood in a Mercedes convertible, \u201cAve Maria\u201d playing on the sound system, and, without provocation, shooting a man twice, once in each leg. With this as the spine of the episode, we get an overview of Jimenez\u2019s post-release life. He spends his $25 million, earned in a settlement with the city, to recruit gang members with expensive cars, road trips, and the like. Flipping allegiances is a taboo in the Chicago scene, and Jimenez\u2019s flagrant poaching leads to an uptick in violence in the blocks that he\u2019s trying to make his territory. The show\u2019s host, Frank Main, is a reporter with the Chicago Sun-Times and knows both Jimenez and the world that he lives in. He teases a complex story to come after this impressive start. \u2014Toby Ball\n\nMy Life of Crime With Erin Moriarty, \u201cThe Family Business\u201d\n\nOn a scale of one to ten, how mad would you be if your mother gave your home address to a serial killer? (This is not a theoretical scenario.) In this new six-episode podcast, 48 Hours\u2019 Erin Moriarty takes listeners inside cases like the Lizzie Borden murders (she spends the night inside the house) and explains how her true-crime career has informed her personal life. In \u201cThe Family Business,\u201d Moriarty, along with colleague Richard Schlessinger and her son, Nick Musurca, a Hollywood horror-movie writer, examine the question of why we love true crime and what happens when a person\u2019s job is talking to people like Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer. Maybe all the terrible information the person has accumulated over 30 years will lead to always expecting the worst-case scenario, like what happened to Moriarty when Nick briefly disappeared while riding his bike in Central Park as a child. This is a different look at true crime than we\u2019re used to, from someone who\u2019s spent her career closer to it than most of us would want to be, if we\u2019re being honest. (Again, pretend a serial killer knows where you live.) A podcast like this doesn\u2019t come along every day, so listen well. \u2014Chanel Dubofsky", "description": "This week\u2019s best true-crime podcasts include Let\u2019s Go to Court!, My Life of Crime With Erin Moriarty, The Missing Cryptoqueen, and Motive.", "authors": ["Vulture Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/true-crime-podcasts/26-true-crime-podcasts-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
