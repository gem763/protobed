Luka Jovic added a fifth in injury-time.\n\n\u201cWe have not scored five goals for a long time,\u201d said Zidane. \u201cWe needed a victory like that. When you start scoring goals, it makes everything easier.\u201d\n\nGareth Bale was absent as he continues to recover from a calf injury but Madrid hardly missed the Welshman, whose future has again been up for discussion this week after he was pictured returning to London.\n\nZidane said he has spoken to Bale and saw him in the changing room at the Santiago Bernabeu. He was also asked if Bale had permission to leave the game five minutes before full-time. \u201cI think so,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cIf he leaves five minutes before the game finishes, he can get home more easily.\u201d\n\nZidane had struck a conciliatory tone on Tuesday too but Bale\u2019s team-mates flourished in his absence, albeit against a limp Leganes side, who remain rooted to the bottom of the table after sacking their coach Mauricio Pellegrino last week.\n\nThis was not a performance to recommend caretaker manager Luis Cembranos for the job long-term.\n\nYet there were some impressive Madrid showings nonetheless, not least from Benzema, who has been Zidane\u2019s most consistent performer by far in recent months and now has seven goals already in all competitions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the goal, it\u2019s what he does for the team,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\nRodrygo, the 18-year-old making only his fourth senior appearance, came into Bale\u2019s position on the right and, particularly in the first half, he shone, grabbing an early goal and providing the frightening turn of pace that Bale once offered before injuries took their toll.\n\n\u201cHe is 18 but you don\u2019t have to be old to score here,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cHe has character and he is getting better and better.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the only question mark was Eden Hazard, who still appears short of his best in a Madrid shirt.\n\nThere were glimpses of the Belgian\u2019s undeniable brilliance but moments of indecision too, that suggest he is finding his feet, and fitness, at his new club.\n\nMadrid\u2019s victory keeps them just a point behind Barcelona, who thrashed Real Valladolid on Tuesday, and pushes them one ahead of Atletico, with a game in hand over their city rivals.\n\nTwo goals arrived in the seventh and eight minutes and Benzema provided each of them, first keeping alive Hazard\u2019s cross for Rodrygo to poke home before teeing up Kroos to flick in at the near post.\n\nLeganes looked jaded, without belief or direction, and they fell three down before the interval as Hazard was fouled by Juan Soriano after a superb through ball from Casemiro.\n\nRamos missed the penalty but was given a second attempt, VAR prompting a re-take for the first time in La Liga after Soriano sprung off his line too early. This time, Ramos made no mistake.\n\nBenzema had hit the post after a smart dummy from Hazard before finally he got the goal he deserved after Luka Modric earned a spot-kick with a slick turn around Kenneth Omeruo. Benzema converted and then departed to a standing ovation.\n\nJovic was his replacement and after having one goal ruled out for offside the Serbian also made his mark. Dani Carvajal\u2019s cross offered up a simple header to make it five.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Real Madrid registered their biggest win since Zinedine Zidane\u2019s return as coach on Wednesday as they demolished struggling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/b62c53_karim-benzema-off-standing-ovation-real-madrid-win-leganes-in-la-liga-on-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
