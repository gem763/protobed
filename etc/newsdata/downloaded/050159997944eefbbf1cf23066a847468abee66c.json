It is commonly known by the brand name Zantac.\n\nOver-the-counter ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach. The prescription versions are used to reduce stomach acid to prevent and treat conditions, such as heartburn and ulcers of the stomach and intestines, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, Health Canada said.\n\nLast week, regulators in Canada, the United States and Europe reported the presence of an impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), in low levels in ranitidine products.\n\nNDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen, meaning long-term exposure to levels above what is considered safe could increase the risk of cancer.\n\nThe recalled lots contain NDMA above accepted levels, Health Canada said.\n\nHealth Canada said it will update its list of affected products as needed.\n\nThe recall applies at the retail level, Apotex said in a release, meaning the products will be pulled off store shelves.\n\nIn addition to the companies' recalls, Health Canada said it has asked the companies to stop distributing ranitidine drugs in Canada temporarily while it assesses NDMA.\n\nLast year, NDMA was one of the impurities found in blood pressure and heart failure medicines called Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers.", "description": "Health Canada says four more companies are recalling heartburn drug ranitidine, commonly known by its brand name Zantac, after presence of a probable cancer-causing impurity was found in some of the drugs.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5288306.1568823151!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1167943729.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
