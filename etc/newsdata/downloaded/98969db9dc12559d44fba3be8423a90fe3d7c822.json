But there is no relief in sight as Maruti Suzuki, a major automobile manufacturer, has now revealed that it is not renewing the contracts of 3,000 temporary employees.\n\nThe reasons are obvious: rapidly rising inventory and an unprecedented slowdown in demand.\n\nA worker adjusts the windscreen wipers of a parked car at a Maruti Suzuki stockyard on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.

Subros, which is part-owned by Japan's Denso Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp, has laid off 800 workers.\n\nThe layoffs come as carmakers including Honda Motor, Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have implemented brief suspensions to production in recent weeks in the face of slow demand, separate sources said. The auto sector, which contributes more than 7 per cent to country's GDP, is facing one of its worst downturns.", "description": "The cull in the auto industry has been so extensive that the initial estimates suggested automakers, parts manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 3,50,000 workers since April this year.
