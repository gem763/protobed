Yes, every man and his dog may be prematurely putting a crown on your heads, but you have to embrace that.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Relish the pedestal you\u2019re being put on. Liverpool lacked that mentality yesterday. They did not turn up at Old Trafford looking like a team that had won their last 17 Premier League games. They didn\u2019t swagger in there like champions in waiting.\"\n\nKeown did give credit to United for the way they set about shackling Liverpool and pressing them at every opportunity.\n\nUnited were underdogs going into the match, but found themselves in front after Marcus Rashford turned in Daniel James cross.\n\nThere was controversy in the build-up to the goal, as Liverpool complained about a foul on Divock Origi which went unpunished as United broke away to score.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSadio Mane then had a goal disallowed as it looked increasingly like it wasn't going to be Liverpool's day.\n\nThe Reds had gone into the clash needing just a win to equal the record for consecutive Premier League victories held by Man City.\n\nBut they struggled to get their usual flowing passing game going, until Lallana's late leveller spared their blushes.\n\nKeown added: \"It took Liverpool a while to sort themselves out but Klopp used his substitutes well and they got something out of this game. That at least suggests they can become champions.\"", "description": "The Reds are six points clear after rescuing a point at Old Trafford thanks to a late goal from substitute Adam Lallana", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664521.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
