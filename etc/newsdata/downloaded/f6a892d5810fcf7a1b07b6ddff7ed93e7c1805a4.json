According to a police report, a university police officer attempted to stop Bardella from entering a stairwell, and requested to see his credentials. When Bardella said he had used the stairwell previously and tried to walk past the officer, the officer blocked the entrance, prompting Bardella to \u201cslap\u201d the officers arm, the report said.\n\nThe report said Bardella then \u201cbegan to run up the stairs,\u201d and was chased by several officers. When officers informed him that he was under arrest, Bardella is said to have \u201cresisted being handcuffed,\u201d and \u201cwas then taken to a prone position\u201d by Georgetown University campus police.\n\nThe report said that neither the officer nor Bardella were hurt. A Metro police official confirmed that Bardella was taken to a police station on Thursday and subsequently released. It was not immediately clear what charges, if any, he would face.\n\nBardella told The Daily Beast that he will be challenging any potential charges and disputed the officer\u2019s version of the story, which he said was inaccurate and \u201cover the top.\u201d The political pundit said he arrived at the event early on Thursday, and was helping his wife and others set up, and had been carrying boxes and items up and down the stairs all morning when the officer confronted him. Bardella said the officer grabbed his arm, and falsely repeatedly claimed that Bardella had \u201cassaulted\u201d him, prompting other officers to intervene.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of an officer who had the best of intentions who grossly overreacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that I slapped him is a lie.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade, Bardella has become one of the most well-known spokespeople and pundits among Washington political reporters due in part to his accessibility and unconventional career path. He worked for a decade in politics as a communications official for Republican members of Congress and conservative media outlets, gaining a controversial reputation for his willingness to share with New York Times journalist Mark Leibovich his own email correspondence with other reporters.\n\nBut after quitting his job as spokesperson for Breitbart News, the longtime Republican became a regular critic of Donald Trump and conservative media, and in 2017, he announced that he had become a Democrat. He has since written numerous columns for national news organizations (including The Daily Beast) and appeared regularly on cable news networks including MSNBC.\n\nThursday\u2019s arrest didn\u2019t stop Bardella from promoting the climate event, a two-day forum featuring a number of top 2020 presidential candidates and focused on issues related to climate change. Following the incident, Bardella continued to post and retweet content from the forum throughout the day on his Twitter account.", "description": "The political strategist tells The Daily Beast several police officers confronted him after one cop \u201cgrossly overreacted\u201d during a stairwell dispute at Georgetown University.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568937904/190919-tani-bardella-tease_a5r9dk", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
