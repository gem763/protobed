On Friday, Senator Cormann hinted that, or other measures, could be brought forward to December but only should the tax cuts fail to fire.\n\nThat will be known in early December with the release of the economic growth numbers for the September quarter.\n\n\"We will be very interested to see the third quarter national accounts data for the September quarter which comes out in early December,'' Senator Cormann told Sky News.\n\nImmigration minister David Coleman, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Cities Minister Alan Tudge on Friday.\n\n\"That will inform our final decisions in relation to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We continue to monitor economic developments. We will continue to make judgements as appropriate.\"\n\nHe was confident the first round of the tax cuts, which were worth $7.8 billion in total, would drive an increase in growth and he rounded on those who say they have failed.\n\n\"There was a level of hyperventilating and quite frankly, entirely premature commentary coming from some quarters on the back of very early data when the effect of the personal income tax cuts was not even two weeks old,'' he said.\n\n\"We are working to a plan. We believe it is very important that we continue to calmly and steadily work to our plan. We have made what we believe are the appropriate judgements.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The last thing that Australians need is for the government to get distracted by, quite frankly, premature and uninformed commentary.\"\n\nFollowing the Treasurers' meeting, however, Victoria's Tim Pallas was less confident. He said the Commonwealth must fast-track its own infrastructure spending and provide financial incentives for states to do the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly obvious that Josh Frydenberg\u2019s income tax cuts haven\u2019t provided the necessary financial boost to households and retailers,'' he said.\n\n\u201cThe Morrison government needs to invest more now in the infrastructure projects the economy needs \u2013 rather than leave the heavy lifting to the states and the Reserve Bank.\u201d\n\nNSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet, whose suggestion that asset recycling be brought back was rebuffed, told AFR weekend the Commonwealth should use other infrastructure incentives such as the reintroduction of competition payments, if only to the smaller states.\n\nThere was furious agreement at the meeting over the need to fast-track infrastructure, but not over who pays. Scott Morrison wrote to the Premiers in August asking them to submit a list of shovel-ready projects but so far, just Queensland has responded.\n\nMr Frydenberg has ruled out incentives to the states to build infrastructure and is trying to guard his own plans to return the budget to surplus.\n\nThe Finance Department figures showed that company tax revenue was $2 billion less than expected by the end of August.\n\nOverall, the deficit for the financial year ending August 31 was $9.7 billion, which was $664 million higher than forecast in the budget.", "description": "The Coalition has maintained that its current policy settings, including a $7.8 billion rollout in income tax cuts and a big infrastructure spend, are sufficient for now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2323%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1bc0fae5857dbeb45274c745bcd45b607c70179c", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
