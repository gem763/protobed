They commandeered broadcast studios, captured national buildings and imposed curfews on the streets. What is happening in Britain this week looks nothing like those grainy TV pictures, but it nonetheless marks an assault on our democracy.\n\nThe government wants to shut down parliamentary democracy, claiming it is acting for the good of parliamentary democracy. From within No 10 Dominic Cummings threatens to end the career of elected MPs. And David Gauke, the Conservative MP who just six weeks ago was secretary of state for justice, wrote to his former government colleagues on Monday to ask them to obey the rule of law.\n\nIn his own pseudo-bumbling fashion, Johnson is taking a leaf out of the book of Trump, Modi, Bolsonaro\n\nJust because the paradoxes are so glaring makes them no less dangerous. The self-proclaimed party of law and order has this summer dropped the first bit to become merely the party of order. In this battle of Brexit-blocking politicians versus the people, the tribune of us plebs is none other than Jacob Rees-Mogg. His leader is Boris Johnson, perhaps the most slovenly would-be authoritarian in contemporary history.\n\nYet the public protests across the country against all this are not especially large; away from the keyboard warriors of social media, the mood is not particularly restive. A friend messaged from a bus in central Bristol last Saturday where two fellow passengers, \u201cladies in their late 60s or early 70s\u201d, looked out at a march against Johnson\u2019s coup and loudly advised the driver to run them over. Yesterday, while the world\u2019s media camped out on College Green for wall-to-wall chaos coverage, another friend posted on Twitter from a dentist\u2019s waiting room in Newcastle. \u201cThree Tory MPs debating Brexit on BBC News channel. Nobody watching.\u201d\n\nSome of this indifference is both eternal and welcome. Amid the greatest disaster, wrote Auden in his poem Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, \u201cthe dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer\u2019s horse / Scratches its innocent behind on a tree\u201d. But there is a more pressing and profound puzzle with which we must wrestle. When renowned historians are comparing this attempted putsch to the Reichstag fire, when denunciations are raining down from constitutional experts, when MPs and BBC broadcasters speak of little else apart from Britain\u2019s democratic crisis \u2013 why does such heated talk leave most of the public so cold?\n\nI detect no signs that Johnson has become the people\u2019s prime minister, capturing the hearts of a grateful nation. Rather, over the past five years he has gone from being the Heineken Tory \u2013 reaching the parts of the electorate other Conservatives just can\u2019t reach \u2013 to a Marmite politician who sharply polarises public opinion. Nor do I believe that what is happening this week has gone either under-reported or misunderstood \u2013 it is blatant subversion of the British way of doing politics.\n\nThe approach to the answer lies again through Auden\u2019s poem: \u201c[T]he ploughman may / have heard the splash, the forsaken cry, / But for him it was not an important failure \u2026 \u201d If today\u2019s residents of Downing Street can so easily gut our democratic institutions, it is largely because many of those institutions long ago lost their importance to the public. In his own pseudo-bumbling fashion, Johnson is taking a leaf out of the book of Donald Trump, Narendra Modi, Jair Bolsonaro: he is deliberately outraging the norms that have governed politics and society, safe in the knowledge that for much of his electorate those conventions have already rotted away to useless totems.\n\nPlay Video 2:06 'Anti-democratic and unconstitutional': Corbyn and Johnson clash over no-deal Brexit \u2013 video\n\nPut bluntly: yes, Britain is mired in a democratic crisis. But it is one that is older, wider and deeper than this week\u2019s debacle over Brexit and parliamentary sovereignty, and it features across our everyday lives. It\u2019s there in our privately run academy schools, which will get another wodge of cash in Wednesday\u2019s expected spending round from chancellor Sajid Javid. Under the auspices of today\u2019s arch-Brexiteers, Cummings and his then frontman at the department for education, Michael Gove, turned our schools system into what an LSE study calls \u201chighly opaque\u201d, marked by \u201clittle transparency, democratic accountability or public or parliamentary scrutiny\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s plain as day in the London borough of Barnet, where the Tory council outsourced the vast bulk of local authority functions to giant private businesses and then \u2013 when the evidence of service failure and ballooning costs grew too thick \u2013 this summer gagged local residents from asking too many questions at council committee meetings. It\u2019s there in the sweetheart deals big builders cut with local councils and the oneGeorge Osborne cut with Google over their tax bill.\n\nThe master-text on the moment we\u2019re in was published nearly 20 years ago. Coping With Post-Democracy was an alarm sounded by the British political scientist Colin Crouch towards the end of Tony Blair\u2019s first term as prime minister. He coined the term \u201cpost-democracy\u201d to refer to a country that still had its ballot boxes and elected chamber and rowdy journalists \u2013 only all were being drained of meaning. Democracy, argued Crouch, \u201cthrives when there are major opportunities for the mass of ordinary people to participate\u201d.\n\nBut the post-democratic order he saw taking shape was \u201ca tightly controlled spectacle managed by rival teams of professional experts in the techniques of persuasion\u201d, in which the interests of multinationals and big businesses would always trump \u201cthe political importance of ordinary working people\u201d, especially with the withering away of unions.\n\nFrom here it was a short step to today\u2019s Westminster of \u201cretail politics\u201c, parties touting their \u201coffer\u201c and the apparatus of marketing. For a while, the sorcerers of the new post-democratic system could buy our consent, as long as house prices kept rising and cheap credit could be thrust down our throats. But then came the banking crisis, which just showed our debt was the financiers\u2019 credit and that they would always collect.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s plot to subvert democracy is more dangerous than Brexit itself | Andrew Rawnsley Read more\n\nFrom the wreckage of that system came much of the 2016 vote for Brexit and it today ensures the indifference of the public as a bunch of posh boys try to strip us of our hard-won rights. Years before the advent of Facebook and Twitter, Crouch warned of a public habituated to a \u201cnegative activism of blame and complaint\u201d, no longer interested in formulating constructive demands \u2013 but merely demanding some MP\u2019s head on a pikestaff.\n\nThis is a different critique of what ails our democracy than the ones you and I are used to seeing, full of complaints about our arthritic institutions and calls for a written constitution alongside token gestures such as moving parliament to the Midlands. Such prescriptions will do no harm, although what the burghers of Dudley have done to deserve the sudden imposition of Peter Bone, I don\u2019t know; but they don\u2019t get near what we are seeing in Britain this week. The public will not be moved by finagling in parliament or cases put forward by well-intentioned lawyers \u2013 important as both are. To do that, our political parties, chiefly Labour, need to show the public what use they are in the 21st century. That means providing advice to voters, not just members, on welfare, housing and employers. It means acting to collectively procure cheap utility deals. It means laying on classes in how politics and economics work and why they matter. Real democratic renewal will not come through Westminster manoeuvring, or new pieces of legal text, but through building serious and sturdy new institutions.\n\n\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist", "description": "It features in our privately run academy schools and outsourcing of public services, says Guardian columnist Aditya Chakrabortty", "authors": ["Aditya Chakrabortty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d944be112f7fb7b9de7c852d8ffc824f24c02871/0_2_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9659a7a13adeec1595246c1ef2a0c69d"}
