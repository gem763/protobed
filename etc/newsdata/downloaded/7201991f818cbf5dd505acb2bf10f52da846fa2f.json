The toxic fumes not only contaminated the local vegetation and water supply but also poisoned nearby residents, some of whom went on to develop cancer.\n\nWithin three months of the disaster, more than 30 people had died of acute radiation sickness.\n\n\"We can only estimate the real effects on people's lives,\" said Jan Haverkamp, a senior nuclear energy expert at Greenpeace, who noted the catastrophe most likely had a severe impact on hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nWhile developing his HBO series, \"Chernobyl,\" the writer and producer Craig Mazin approached conflicting accounts of the event with a degree of caution.\n\n\"I always defaulted to the less dramatic because the things that we know for sure happened are so inherently dramatic,\" he told Variety's \"TV Take\" podcast.\n\nThe miniseries earned 19 Emmy nominations, including in the Outstanding Limited Series category, in which it's considered a frontrunner. The award show will be held Sunday, September 22.\n\nFor the most part, it's hauntingly accurate \u2014 with the exception of a few artistic liberties. We fact-checked some of the major plot points from the series to determine what's true and what verges on myth.\n\nNote: This article contains spoilers of episodes one through five.", "description": "The HBO series \"Chernobyl\" is mostly accurate, but the writer had to invent a character and change the chronology of a few events.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ce56a1aa7999b00604deb64-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
