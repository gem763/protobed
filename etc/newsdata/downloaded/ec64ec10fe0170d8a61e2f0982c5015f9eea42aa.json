However, Mozilla believes its anti-tracking technology and individual privacy reports can counter the ad industry's misleading and confusing tracking consent forms, ostensibly adopted as part of a push for greater transparency.\n\n\"The solutions put forth by other tech companies and the ad industry provide the illusion of choice,\" argues Mozilla.\n\nMozilla's tracking blocking efforts have resulted in each instance of the Firefox browser blocking 175 tracking domains per day, which it argues users would be overwhelmed by if they had to manage consent for each site. Additionally, the forms use so-called 'dark patterns' to trick users into giving consent, it argues.\n\nThe Firefox privacy report also offers a snapshot of any data breaches the user may have been affected by via the Firefox Monitor breach-alert service. And users can also access the Firefox Lockwise password manager, which allows users to sync passwords across Firefox on the desktop to Firefox on iOS and Android, and can now generate complex passwords.\n\nFirefox 70 also introduces streamlined security indicators for HTTPS and HTTP sites. HTTPS sites now display a grey padlock icon, while all HTTP sites have a padlock with a red strike-through to indicate a connection over an insecure protocol.\n\nThe browser no longer displays the name of the company if they have used an Extended Validation (EV) SSL certificate. This information is now available by clicking the shield icon.\n\nAdditionally, this release includes performance improvements for Firefox on macOS that Mozilla claims can reduce power consumer and speed up page loads by up to 22%.\n\nFinally, the update addresses 14 security CVEs, including a set of critical memory safety bugs that could be exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nMore on Mozilla and its Firefox browser", "description": "Mozilla doubles down on privacy to counter confusing online third-party tracking consent forms.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/17/dbce9a9d-1a12-4ff6-bb63-b8475d58ec0d/thumbnail/770x578/72e7977bbe0bd9634f86a6369c04074f/mozilla-firefox-to-block-cryptomining-sc-5cb496c5fe727300ba12550f-1-apr-17-2019-9-31-10-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
