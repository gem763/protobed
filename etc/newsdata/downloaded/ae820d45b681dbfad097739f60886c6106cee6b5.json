He did all of that against Scotland.\u201d\n\nMartinez also said he was glad to see other players step up and lead the way with Hazard out injured.\n\n\u201cI was really pleased with the performances of our experienced players particularly because Eden Hazard was not here,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThey had to take over the leadership and show by example, and I thought Jan Vertonghen did that perfectly, he\u2019s a really strong leader.\u201d\n\nDespite the praise being heaped upon De Bruyne\u2019s shoulders, the Manchester City man played down his performance.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play a world class match, I just did my job,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cWhen your career is over, then you can look back at what you did.
