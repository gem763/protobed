Created by playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney, who won an Oscar for co-writing Moonlight, the series uses magical realism to highlight the contrast between David\u2019s inner potential and the world of drugs and crime that threatens to bring him down.\n\nAkili McDowell, a 16-year-old high-school junior from Houston, takes a refreshing and often devastating approach to portraying David\u2019s fantasy world while staying grounded in the boy\u2019s reality. Ahead of tonight\u2019s \u201cLove or Poetize These Hoes,\u201d a lovely episode in which David goes to his first high-school dance, McDowell spoke with Vulture about the pressures of leading a TV show, dancing in tonight\u2019s episode, and how Oprah smelled when he first met her.\n\nWhen you auditioned for the role, who was David to you, and what were you thinking then in terms of how to play him?\n\nHonestly, David related so much to me. That\u2019s why it was so important to me that I get this audition because, honestly, with David being raised by a single mother and him feeling like he had to be the man of the house at such an early age and make all these grown folks\u2019 decisions and things like that, I\u2019ve also felt like that in my life. He just wants to be there for his mom. She doesn\u2019t gotta worry about David. That\u2019s what he wants. David\u2019s gonna do his job; David gonna get things done. And I felt that way in my life as well.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve filmed an entire season and spent a lot of time in David\u2019s shoes, what does it mean to you to play him?\n\nThere\u2019s no other story like this on television right now. It\u2019s very dear to me, it\u2019s very kind to me, because I feel like it\u2019s bigger than just doing a TV show. I feel like I\u2019m the voice of the kids that don\u2019t get to speak out, and they go through these hard things, and they\u2019re forced to make these grown folks\u2019 decisions day in and day out. And they feel like they can\u2019t tell nobody, or it\u2019s not okay to cry, but I want them to know it\u2019s okay to cry. That\u2019s what\u2019s important to me \u2014 that somebody else out there has looked up to me. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve related to a character, because there are many characters I\u2019ve seen parts of me in, but this is the closest a character has resembled me.\n\nIn tonight\u2019s episode, David says, \u201cI\u2019m mad I can\u2019t be normal.\u201d What do you think he meant by that?\n\nThe things that he goes through every day aren\u2019t normal. And it\u2019s not healthy either. The show that he has to do \u2014 it\u2019s like different characters that he has to play and the emotional roller coaster that he goes on every day. He can barely sleep. He barely has time to recoup or get to his self. Everything is just on ten and fresh with him. You barely see David eat.\n\nIn tonight\u2019s episode, we got to see yet another side of David \u2014 a regular high -school kid who\u2019s sweating over asking a girl to a dance and what to wear. You also did a dance number with Isaiah Johnson and backup dancers. What did you think when you saw in the script you were going to get to do that?\n\nI was wondering how it would go. I guess you could say I went viral for dancing to Michael Jackson when I was a little kid. I got a lot of views on YouTube, and I was on the news for it. But that was years ago. So I was kinda nervous, but I had fun doing it so it kinda took the nerves off.\n\nDid you have a lot of time rehearsing in the water? Dancing in water is different.\n\nYes, ma\u2019am, it is. We actually didn\u2019t rehearse with water. Right before we shot it, we danced in the water. We just rehearsed a lot to make sure we got all the moves down. It was really a lot of fun. That was dope.\n\nOne of the things that is so special about the show is how it incorporates magical realism. Your scenes with Isaiah Johnson, who plays Sky, must be tricky, because you have an actor to play with, but at the same time the audience knows this is in David\u2019s imagination. And then you do part of those scenes over without him. What kind of process do you go through when you work on those scenes?\n\nWell, you have to have great writers. And just a great cast in general to keep you mindful of what\u2019s going on. But as the actor, you have to be mindful of what the true intention is. It was really interesting to do it with Isaiah and then come back and see it all put together and see that he was never really there. I have to just keep that in mind\u2014he\u2019s not really there, but for David he is. I felt that was really powerful in that first episode.\n\nWe see it in tonight\u2019s episode, too, when David arrives at the dance and he begins to panic a little bit. He sees light fixtures bursting and decorations falling down, but none of that is really happening. Where do you go in your head to perform that, since nothing is happening around you that you can react to?\n\nI\u2019ve always had a wild imagination. I used to always think, What if this happened? Or what if that happened? I can visualize things happening even though they\u2019re not happening. In normal life, you visualize something in your head but you don\u2019t let your face show it. When you\u2019re acting, you have to let your face show it, and let the camera pick up every little thing, whether it\u2019s just a twitch of an eye or a raise of an eyebrow.\n\nHow did you enjoy playing this side of David, a more carefree teenager?This is the lighter side of David. He\u2019s DJ at school. He\u2019s goofy. He hangs, he\u2019s fun, he makes jokes, which is also me at school, and so that was cool, and I loved getting into new things like that.\n\nHave you been through the drama of your first high-school dance yet?\n\nNo, ma\u2019am, I haven\u2019t been through that yet.\n\nDid you learn anything from David\u2019s experience?\n\nDavid is very different when it comes to things like that. [Laughs.]\n\nMaybe not listen to Mom so much?\n\nDefinitely not listen to Mom so much!\n\nWhat do you think of that suit she picked out for him?\n\nShoot, when I first got it, when I first put it on, it was barely past my shins! I really didn\u2019t enjoy it, you know? [Laughs.] Cayden K. Wiliams, who plays my little brother JG, really let me have it on set that day. I feel like once Travis [Cole, who plays Miss Elijah] fixed it for him, it wasn\u2019t that bad. It was actually a pretty cool suit.\n\nIt was, and it matched what Sky was wearing as well.\n\nYes, ma\u2019am! I\u2019m glad that you picked that up.\n\nYou mentioned Cayden. The home scenes are so good. It feels like a real family.\n\nCayden does act like my little brother. We play fight, we joke on set. When I say we\u2019re literally a family together in this thing, I mean it.\n\nAnd, of course, you saw Miss Alana [Arenas] in the last episode, how amazing she is. You can see where David gets his imagination from and how he wants to make the best of a situation. He gets it from his mother.\n\nDavid returns from the dance to find the rent-past-due notice on the door. What did you think of that ending, after a pretty light episode, for him?\n\nIt was just another day in David\u2019s life. Everything could be going great, he just got back from the dance, everything\u2019s on the up, and then you come home and it\u2019s like he\u2019s grabbed back right into reality. You have to do what you gotta do for your family. Things are starting to get real now. That\u2019s what that is.\n\nOn top of landing your first leading role, you got to work with people like Oprah and Michael B. Jordan. How much interaction did you have with them? Did you learn anything from them?\n\nYes, of course, because they are obviously very wise and very influential people. Just being a part of the OWN family and the OWN network is really amazing, because at the OWN network, all of the shows mean something. We\u2019re all unapologetically black and it\u2019s just so real, all the shows on OWN. One of my first interviews was with Oprah, and she came to set, and everybody\u2019s like, \u201cOh my God, oh my God! Ms. Winfrey is here.\u201d And everybody was running around, and I\u2019m super-nervous, but on the outside I looked cool, you know? [Laughs.] On the outside, I was calm, but inside I\u2019m shaking. I meet Ms. Winfrey, and I do as I generally do: \u201cHey, how ya doing,\u201d and I reach my hand out and go for a handshake and she just embraces me. She gives me a huge hug! And she meets my mom and things like that. And she smelled great, by the way. Just to throw that in there. [Laughs.]\n\nI actually didn\u2019t meet MBJ until after we finishing filming and I went to Sundance for the very first time. He gave me some wise, wise words and words of encouragement, to stay myself. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t let this industry change who you are as a person. Still be the kind-hearted, passionate, hard-working young man I\u2019ve seen from the first time I watched your audition tape.\u201d So that was a wonderful experience, too.\n\nWe are halfway through the season now. Can you give us a little tease of what\u2019s to come?\n\nWhatever you see David do, whether you think this is the best decision or not, whether he should\u2019ve did it or not, he did it for survival. Not only for himself, but for his family and to survive at school.\n\nNow you\u2019re scaring me.\n\nYes, ma\u2019am. It might get rough, but, hey, you gotta do what you gotta do. You gotta stay ready.", "description": "An interview with David Makes Man star Akili McDowell, a 16-year-old high school junior from Houston, Texas, on how he portrays David\u2019s fantasy world while staying grounded in the boy\u2019s reality.", "authors": ["Maria Elena Fernandez"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/11-akili-mcdowell-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
