It is experienced with the evacuations and firefighting, which is complicated by seasonal high winds. The power outages, on the other hand, are something new here in the northern part of the state.\n\nAround 2 million people lost power over the weekend as the mammoth utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, cut electricity in a planned \u201cpublic safety power shut-off.\u201d It is the second round of mass outages in less than a month, with another expected on Tuesday.\n\nThe utility, which sought bankruptcy protection due to the threat of suits from past fires, calls the outages the \u201cnew normal,\u201d necessary to prevent its equipment from sparking a catastrophic fire under high-wind and bone-dry conditions. The fire-season shut-offs, says PG&E, could last a decade as it seeks to modernize its vast network.\n\nIf this is the new normal, it has broad implications for the vitality of the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy \u2013 and for the people who live here. A big concern is that the outages will exacerbate inequity in the state. Those who can afford to independently power their homes and businesses with generators and energy-battery storage will do so, while vulnerable populations and mom-and-pop businesses are at risk.\n\n\u201cRich people in California are going to go in that direction, and the real question is how should we help low-income people respond to this challenge,\u201d says Michael Wara, director of Stanford University\u2019s climate and energy policy program. \u201cPeople are just beginning to understand the magnitude of the [blackout] impacts.\u201d\n\nThe challenge is evident here at the foot of Mount Tamalpais State Park, affectionately known as \u201cMt. Tam,\u201d just north of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge. In Mill Valley, where Mr. Wara lives, several of his neighbors have solar power, including Jim Budish, who runs an insurance business out of his home.\n\nUnbeknownst to many solar homeowners, however, panels are useless when the power grid goes down. Energy needs to be stored in batteries in order to keep flowing. That\u2019s why, when Mr. Budish began to get notices about the possibility of frequent power outages, he invested in two Tesla batteries.\n\nThe batteries, large white panels mounted on the wall inside a garage shared with bikes and surfing body boards, were not cheap. Installation, plus other equipment, came to $17,000, which will be offset by a 25% tax break.\n\nStill, when they got their first test a couple of weeks ago, not even his digital clocks blinked to indicate a temporary outage. He and his wife, who works with him, were able to run their five-bedroom home as before \u2013 the lights, the freezer, the pool pump. It worked seamlessly again when the power went out Saturday.\n\nThere is one major drawback: He has no internet, which seems to be connected to the grid. He uses his cell phone as a wi-fi \u201chot spot\u201d but that\u2019s proven unreliable. Without the internet, he headed to San Francisco Monday morning in search of a Starbucks so he could work \u2013 the reason he got his Tesla \u201cpower wall\u201d in the first place.\n\nStill, his neighbors with solar have been asking about his set-up. In fact, before this latest outage, one visited his garage. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018How do I get this? Right now?\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Budish has energy to spare, and that sparks a question for him: Why can\u2019t he share his extra power with his neighbors \u2013 or with those less well-off?\n\n\u201cThis may sound a little out of this world,\u201d he ventures, waxing philosophical. \u201cI look at energy that people use in their everyday lives kind of like health care. Everybody should have it. There shouldn\u2019t be someone who doesn\u2019t have power to their home because they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho can afford to lose food?\u201d\n\nThe residents of Marin City couldn\u2019t agree more. Less than a 10-minute drive from Mr. Budish\u2019s house, this community was once a diverse, thriving town that attracted African Americans and others to work in a nearby shipyard in World War II.\n\nWhen that closed, job and housing discrimination prevented black families from moving. Today, this is a heavily African American, poor community, with no local grocery store, and many residents live in subsidized housing. They are surrounded by some of the highest-priced real estate in the nation.", "description": "Around 2 million Californians lost power in preemptive blackouts and 180,000 people had to evacuate ahead of the Kincade Fire this weekend.", "authors": ["Francine Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aKzp669dsmZEABVwJFSwfA--~B/aD02MDA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/csmonitor.com/8f71cf518f4986831da92729db2dcaaf", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
