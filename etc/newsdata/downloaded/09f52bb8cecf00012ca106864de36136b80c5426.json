In order to begin that process, Treasury recommends adjusting\u2013 not ending \u2013 the so-called \u201cnet worth sweep,\u201d under which each GSE is permitted a $3 billion capital cushion. A senior Treasury official said they are considering raising the amount of earnings each firm can retain, but details regarding specific amounts and timing would need to be worked out by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and the Treasury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the plan does not specifically address an initial public offering, Treasury officials told reporters that it does direct the Treasury and the FHFA together to develop a recapitalization plan that would potentially contemplate issuing additional public stock in a public market.\n\nThe government would continue to support the GSEs after the conservatorships.\n\nFew other specifics were included.\n\nTrump issued a memorandum in March directing the Treasury to develop a plan to end the GSE conservatorship.\n\nAmong the other goals of the plan are protecting American taxpayers against future bailouts, preserving the 30-year fixed mortgage and helping Americans make home purchases.\n\nIt has been more than a decade since Fannie and Freddie were taken into conservatorship. They have been operating within the government since being bailed out for nearly $200 billion at the height of the financial crisis.\n\nTreasury provides financial support to the GSEs through the Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (PSPAs).\n\nThe two government-sponsored enterprises do not originate loans \u2013 instead they purchase and guarantee them on the secondary market. They guarantee more than half of the nation\u2019s mortgages, so overhaul plans are likely to receive a close eye from those who are concerned about a potential hike in mortgage rates and housing costs.\n\nPrivatizing the entities has been a longtime goal of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who told FOX Business in November 2016 that the administration had to \u201cget them out of government control.\u201d\n\nTaking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out from under government control could be a boon to shareholders \u2013 who have essentially had shares wiped out. As of 2012, profits from Fannie and Freddie have been redirected to the U.S. Treasury. Some hedge funds, however, have been betting on their return to the private sector.\n\nCalabria told FOX Business in May that he\u2019s considering an IPO of Fannie and Freddie as early as the first half of 2020 in order to raise capital.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The U.S. Treasury Department wants to allow the GSEs to keep more of a capital cushion as they transition out of government control.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/03/0/0/AP_19041521144603.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
