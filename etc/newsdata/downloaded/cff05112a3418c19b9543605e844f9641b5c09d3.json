It also set new safety conditions.\n\nUber Pro, a tiered loyalty scheme designed to reward commitment from drivers, already operates in many countries but is now coming to Britain, where Uber has around 60,000 drivers, as part of a phased roll-out to be completed in January.\n\n\"We want to do more to help drivers and their families build toward their future,\" said Uber's General Manager for the UK and Ireland Melinda Roylett.\n\nRewards such as free courses, vehicle inspections, known as MOTs, 24/7 roadside assistance and discounted car maintenance are available depending on the tier a driver reaches and are dependent on factors including ratings and the number of trips.\n\nUber has made several changes to its business model over the last two years in an effort to assuage regulator concerns.", "description": "Uber to launch UK driver loyalty scheme amid license battle", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8O2AT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
