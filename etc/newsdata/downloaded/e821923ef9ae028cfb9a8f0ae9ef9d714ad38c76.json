Conditions in the US, notably California, were quite wet, while the southern hemisphere was generally drier than average. Queensland in Australia was the exception after rain led to large-scale flooding.\n\nIn Europe, February began with lower than average temperatures. Heavy snowfall in Bosnia resulted in severe flooding and landslides. By the end of the month, however, conditions were drier and extremely warm for the time of year. France, Spain and Romania all saw wildfires.\n\nSea ice is decreasing globally, especially in the Arctic. In the Antarctic, there is no such trend, though sea ice for February has been below average for the last four years.", "description": "The European Earth Observation Programme Copernicus shows that average global temperatures were above average for February 2019.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/69/62/17/1000x563_cmsv2_492767bf-9d3e-5e8f-a747-be0c12b4eeb7-3696217.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-15"}
