Maurkice Pouncey wasn\u2019t even going to delay word of his status in the amount of time it takes to ask a question.\n\nMore than three hours before the Pittsburgh Steelers listed him as questionable for Sunday\u2019s home opener against the Seattle Seahawks, Pouncey was much more direct.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m playing this week,\u201d the veteran center said Friday, \u201cso this can be a short interview, honestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially after last week, man. who wants to miss a game?\u201d\n\nComing off a 33-3 loss at the New England Patriots in their season opener, the Steelers go into the weekend relieved that they should have close to if not all of their roster available to them against Seattle.\n\nAmong the seven starters who have missed practice time this week because of injury or illness, only Joe Haden\u2019s health remains in question after the final practice of the week.\n\nHaden joined Pouncey, receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and outside linebacker T.J. Watt as former Pro Bowl players who left last week\u2019s blowout during the fourth quarter because of injury. Watt (hip) and Smith-Schuster (toe) went through relatively full practice weeks without incident, and both said they will play Sunday.\n\nHaden, though, did not practice until Friday because of a shoulder injury for which he received treatment afterward. He is listed as questionable on the injury report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s feeling better,\u201d Haden said of his left shoulder, which was wrapped during practice. \u201cHopefully it just continues to get better in the next couple days and hopefully I can go.\n\n\u201cObviously still feeling a little pain, but it is what it is.\u201d\n\nIf Haden cannot play, former first-round pick Artie Burns could serve as one of the Steelers\u2019 two primary outside cornerbacks in a game for the first time since he was demoted last October. A starter for most of the first 2\u00bd seasons of his career, Burns did not have his fifth-year contract option picked up by the Steelers this spring.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been out for a while, so I am definitely looking forward to my opportunity, if I get it,\u201d Burns said.\n\nThat\u2019s no sure thing yet, and it might not be until game time that it\u2019s determined if Haden will play. Meanwhile, running back James Conner (illness), strong safety Terrell Edmunds (glute), Smith-Schuster, Watt and free safety Sean Davis are expected to be in the lineup at Heinz Field.\n\nDavis said he practiced fully Friday and will play Sunday after missing the New England game because of an ankle injury suffered late in training camp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling a lot better,\u201d said Davis, who missed only one game over his first three NFL seasons.\n\n\u201cI had a rough little start to this year but looking forward to putting some consecutive games on tape now, knock on wood. My body should be healed up now, no more injuries, so I am just happy to be back out there with everybody and start getting some Ws now.\u201d\n\nThough the loss of Haden could negate it, Davis\u2019 return to the secondary would be a welcome sight for a Steelers\u2019 defense that allowed passing plays of 58 and 44 yards and seven receptions of at least 20 yards in the 30-point loss to the Patriots.\n\nIn Davis\u2019 place was former Alliance of American Football player Kameron Kelly, who started at free safety while making his NFL regular-season debut.\n\n\u201cI am glad that (Davis) is back out there,\u201d Haden said. \u201cHe knows the defense very well. He\u2019s always comfortable, so just hearing his voice back there kind of helps because he knows what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nThe only Steeler who definitely won\u2019t play Sunday is special teamer and fullback Roosevelt Nix, who has a knee injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Forget waiting until the release of the league-mandated injury report.
