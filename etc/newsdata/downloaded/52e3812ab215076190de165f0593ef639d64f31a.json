Search: \"Late Night Texts Vinyl Pants.\"\n\nAnd while more than 31,000 people have liked the image, many did a double take after seeing it.\n\nThat's because they couldn't get over the fact that the nude-colour makes it look like Skyy forgot to put on trousers and is naked from the waist down.\n\nOne person commented: \"I thought she was naked and oiled up.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I thought she was naked I was like tf is you wearing woman.\"\n\nA third wrote: \"Omg on first glance I thought she wasn\u2019t wearing pants lol.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHowever not everyone was shocked by the picture.\n\nSome of Fashion Nova's followers really liked the look and shared fire and heart eye emojis in the comments section.\n\n\"Ohhh that looks nice,\" replied one user.\n\nA second responded: \"Beautiful\".\n\nFashion Nova are currently selling the Late Night Texts Vinyl Pants for \u00a330.80.\n\nThey're available on the website in a range of different colours, including black, red, yellow, pink, orange and white.\n\nReviews on the site are very positive with shoppers saying they were \"true to size\" and describing them as being very \"sexy\".", "description": "Fashion Nova caused a stir on Instagram after sharing a snap of a model wearing a pair of their latex trousers", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659581.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Models-clothing-fail-as-fans-think-she-looks-naked-in-latex-trousers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
