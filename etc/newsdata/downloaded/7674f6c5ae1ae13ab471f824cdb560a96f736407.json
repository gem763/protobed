But making an appearance today in Pakistan, the Duchess of Cambridge traded in her typical buttoned-up polish for a sporty updo while playing cricket with local pro players as part of her and Prince William\u2019s royal tour of the country.\n\nThough she began the day with her newly lightened lengths styled in her signature cascade of loose-barrel curls, come game time the mother of three stepped onto the field with a wispy, center-parted ponytail that recalled the casual beauty of her sister-in-law Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Middleton has opted for an athletic style: In August, for the inaugural King\u2019s Cup regatta, Middleton swept her tousled lengths underneath a baseball cap; back in the Spring, she pulled her hair back into a neat, no-fuss low ponytail with a black elastic. Middleton may be royalty, but even she has to toss her hair back and throw on some trainers from time to time.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "For a game of cricket in Pakistan, the Duchess of Cambridge swept her newly highlighted lengths back into a wispy, loose ponytail.", "authors": ["Jenna Rennert"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2_95oI7H5pAqZv7rksaPpg--~B/aD0zMzk2O3c9MTkxMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/a664cb813e17c3f8dc936823999e0db8", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
