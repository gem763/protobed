Immediate sadness will have mounted to sheer frustration and fury as the details became known via radio, press and the internet that a group of young men, privileged and talented enough to be wearing their country\u2019s shirt, were subjected to racist insults and Nazi salutes by a section of home spectators in Sofia, Bulgaria. Why? For being black.\n\nI am not as naive as to think that racism does not go on, even in our own largely enlightened society. Yet I am saddened by every report of it I encounter; far more than \u201csaddened,\u201d I am baffled.\n\nWhy would anyone find cause for insult or injury to a fellow person on grounds of skin colour or even culture? My long life has been immeasurably enriched by friendships with Jewish people, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, East Asians and more.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAdmittedly, my professional career gave me the opportunity for such friendships, but for enrichment\u2019s sake, I would certainly recommend cultivating friendships with people from different backgrounds. You will be surprised at what new things you can learn, what new outlooks on life may be gathered.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The young men on the receiving end are to be commended and recommended, both for their stand and for their courage. No one going about their daily work should experience or be expected to operate under vile abuse.\n\nI hope the young men affected here will take further courage from the support they will undoubtedly receive from right-minded men and women, globally. One hopes that Fifa (in this case) will take appropriate. strong action against the offenders \u2013 not so much punishment, as education in what should not by now need to be considered \u201cenlightened thinking\u201d.\n\nDavid Wallace\n\nWest Sussex\n\nScottish politics\n\nDerek MacKay tells us that Scotland is more than ready in financial and economic terms to leave the UK. *Stifles laughter*. Nicola Sturgeon tells us that there might well be a hard border between England and Scotland in the event of separation. Mike Russell flirts with the idea of getting the courts to force the UK government to allow the SNP to hold a referendum. And Chris McEleny wants to call independence if the SNP wins a majority of seats at an election.\n\nAre we in the middle of a silly season in Scottish politics?\n\nJill Stephenson\n\nEdinburgh\n\nThis is not the end for Extinction Rebellion\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in central London have highlighted the existential threat that the carbon economy poses to life on Earth with protests that have been both good-natured and peaceful.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police have ruthlessly policed the protests, arresting over 1,400 Extinction rebels including a 77-year-old rabbi. They have also confiscated the property of the demonstrators, including the wheelchairs of disabled activists.\n\nOn Monday evening, the police took away the right of protest from Extinction Rebellion by announcing \u201cAny assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion \u2018Autumn Uprising\u2019 \u2026 must now cease their protests within London\u201d, threatening that \u201canyone who fails to comply with the condition is liable for arrest and prosecution\u201d.\n\nHowever the \u201cAutumn Uprising\u201d ends, this is not the last of Extinction Rebellion. The fight for a future will go on.\n\nAs for the police and the despicable Boris Johnson, who sanctioned them to use the \u201cfull force of the law\u201d against Extinction Rebellion, I comfort myself with the thought that should we fail to stop catastrophic climate change, they will burn with the rest of us.\n\nSasha Simic\n\nLondon N16\n\nCulling at the polls\n\nGiven their lack of appeal and Boris Johnson\u2019s ever more glaring ineptitude, maybe the Conservatives will need to go further than disenfranchising those without photo ID to ensure their return to power in future elections.\n\nPerhaps they should restrict the right to vote to those earning over \u00a385,000 per annum? Or maybe Cambridge Analytica could help them identify and ban non-Tory voters? I\u2019m sure Mr Cummings will be thinking along similar lines.\n\nPaul Halas\n\nStroud\n\nVoter fraud\n\nI was born in the UK 60 years ago (and have a birth certificate to prove this), have always lived in the UK, worked in the NHS for 25 years and have voted in elections since 1978. When my passport expires early next year (I have no plans to travel abroad so do not intend to renew) I will not have a passport. I have a perfectly valid driving licence issued in 1977 (it\u2019s preserved in its original plastic wallet) which I use as proof of identity without a problem. However, I am now to be effectively disenfranchised unless I pay to renew a passport I will not use for the purpose intended or pointlessly change a valid driving licence, ie, pay to retain the right to vote. For which I thank this government, but alas will not be able to thank with my vote.\n\nLestyn Davies Jones\n\nLeicester\n\nCatalonia chaos\n\nThe decision of Spain\u2019s Supreme Court to sentence Catalan politicians and activists to lengthy jail sentences following their bid to win independence in 2017 is truly appalling.\n\nNormal western countries don\u2019t lock up democratic opponents and for an EU member state in the 21st century to have political prisoners beggars belief. This situation raises serious concerns about the very nature of democracy in Europe.\n\nThe EU and the rest of the international community must intervene, offering the parties a way out of the conflict. This is no longer an internal Spanish affair, it is a European and a global crisis. The EU does not need to take a side in the argument, rather it should act as an impartial mediator, looking at democratic and negotiated solutions.\n\nThe EU cannot afford not to intervene or the crisis will simply escalate. Let the EU help Spain and Catalonia find peace.\n\nAlex Orr\n\nEdinburgh", "description": "I must be among hundreds of thousands to wake this morning to news of racism at a football match.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/09/England-players-wait-after-the-match-was-stopped-for-racist-chanting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
