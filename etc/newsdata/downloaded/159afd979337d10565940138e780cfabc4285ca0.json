Life is ephemeral and death the only certainty.\u201d\n\nLatin America has long harbored a mystical, up front fascination with death. Few visits to Buenos Aires are considered complete without a visit to the Recoleta cemetery where luminaries like iconic former First Lady Eva Per\u00f3n are buried. Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead pays homage to the deceased with festive foods and decorative skulls.\n\n\u201cDeath is very much present in the Latin American sensibility,\u201d said Peter Sanipat\u00edn, a psychologist in Ecuador. \u201cThese activities allow us to confront an imaginary death and come out triumphant, at least for the moment.\u201d\n\nIn many cities across the globe, tourism groups have begun encouraging visitors to take a step toward the dark side as an opportunity to reflect on the past and the very nature of humanity.\n\n\u201cImagining that situation helps us confront something that scares us,\u201d Nathan Digby, a philosophy and religion professor, said of the surge in cemetery tours.\n\nThe idea for Ecuador\u2019s nighttime cemetery visits arose as Ortega was investigating out of the box tour ideas for her tourism studies thesis. As a twist, she decided guests would be completely blindfolded and spend time lying inside a crypt.\n\n\u201cDoing it blindfolded intensifies the experience,\u201d she said.\n\nOn a recent evening, 13 visitors ventured into the cemetery, which is filled with blocks of tombs stacked four or more levels high. Amid the graveyard silence, guides asked questions and made nerve-rattling sounds by clashing metal objects.\n\nOne young woman who is part of the tour company touched guests on the arm and begged not to be left alone as they entered an underground crypt.\n\nThen the thrill-seekers were led into empty cement niches where caskets are typically placed and asked to think about what their relatives would say on the day of their funeral.\n\nOne woman panicked, refused to participate and left the group.\n\nBut others said they found it to be a nearly meditative experience.\n\n\u201cI reflected on death,\u201d said Stalin Caiza, 23, who left with tears in his eyes. \u201cAs they say, we are made of dust and will return to dust.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's a chilly night in Ecuador's capital and the small group of men and women visiting the city's oldest cemetery are understandably nervous.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gonzalo Solano"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/ecuador_cemetery_tour_06050_c0-217-5184-3239_s1770x1032.jpg?8b8f23121690e0737bdb7f9c933479ff63e997a3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
