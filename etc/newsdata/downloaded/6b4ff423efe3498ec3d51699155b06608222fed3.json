According to a recent book from Cliff Sims, a former aide in Donald Trump\u2019s White House, the president told then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) a couple of years ago, in reference to Pelosi, \u201cHave you seen her? She\u2019s a disaster. Every time she opens her mouth another Republican gets elected.\u201d\n\nThe comment helped capture the GOP\u2019s assumptions on the California Democrat, though the latest national Fox News poll, released late yesterday, suggests those assumptions are due for an overhaul.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s personal favorability rating is under water by 6 points (42 percent favorable vs. 48 percent unfavorable). Still, that\u2019s a new high, and gives her the highest favorable rating of Capitol Hill leadership tested in the poll.\n\nObviously, no one with a 42% favorability rating should be described as broadly popular with the American electorate. That said, according to Fox News\u2019 results, Pelosi\u2019s favorability is roughly in line with Donald Trump\u2019s \u2013 in fact, her unfavorable rating is quite a bit better than the president\u2019s \u2013 and the House Speaker has stronger public support than Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nAs regular readers know, less than a year ago, after House Republicans suffered through their worst midterm cycle since the immediate aftermath of Watergate, there was a fair amount of anxiety about Democrats elevating Pelosi back to the Speaker\u2019s office \u2013 not because she\u2019d failed to earn it, but because some in the party believed she was too unpopular.\n\nIt was certainly the image GOP officials have spent years cultivating, condemning the villainous \u201cSan Francisco liberal,\u201d and trying desperately to tie Democratic candidates to Pelosi, occasionally in races that are unrelated to the U.S. House.\n\nIn 2017, some Republican insiders were quite candid about the party\u2019s go-to move: complain about Pelosi and wait for conservative voters to have the conditioned, knee-jerk response.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see if it works,\u201d then-NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) said. \u201cI believe it still works.\u201d\n\nBut in practice, anti-Pelosi tactics didn\u2019t prevent Democrats from reclaiming the House majority in 2018, and a year later, Fox News\u2019 latest poll suggests Pelosi\u2019s public standing has never been stronger. Indeed, Fox News has been testing the Democratic leader\u2019s favorability for more than 12 years, and the California congresswoman now has the highest support of her career.\n\nIf Republican advertising starts swapping out Pelosi for new progressive villains, we\u2019ll know why.", "description": "For many political observers, it's simply assumed that Nancy Pelosi is unpopular to the point of toxicity.
