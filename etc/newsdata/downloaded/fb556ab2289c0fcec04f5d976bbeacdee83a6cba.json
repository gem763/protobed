O\u2019Connor authored an op-ed, \u201cThe opioid crisis: A 20-year conspiracy against patients,\u201d to speak against Purdue Pharma\u2019s role in exacerbating the opioid crisis.\n\nPURDUE PHARMA'S SACKLER FAMILY USED HIDDEN ACCOUNTS TO TRANSFER $1B: COURT DOCS\n\n\u201cAmericans are learning what\u2019s happened over the past 20 years. The story is absolutely unbelievable and it's not just Purdue. It's a whole ecosystem. You've got gross negligence, this incredibly predatory behavior, but if money is coming out of these lawsuits that can be put toward patient-centered solutions, that's fantastic.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of blame to go around and I take some of that myself as a family member. I wasn\u2019t educated and I could\u2019ve done more as well, so I\u2019m cautiously hopeful,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.\n\nO\u2019Connor said her sister was going to talk to doctors to get pain medication and didn\u2019t talk about it because \u201cthere is a lot of shame around this disease.\u201d\n\nOxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, reached a tentative deal with dozens of states and thousands of local governments last week.\n\nOn Monday, the company filed for bankruptcy in New York.\n\nPURDUE PHARMA REACHES TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT IN OPIOID LAWSUIT, BUT SOME STATES AREN'T ON BOARD\n\nThe Sackler family stands to lose billions after a litany of lawsuits claiming that their company marketed the painkiller OxyContin as non-addictive despite knowing otherwise.\n\n\u201cMany aren\u2019t certified in addiction medicine. Lots of doctors can\u2019t even prescribe the meds you need for medication-assisted treatment,\u201d O\u2019Connor said, pointing out one of the \u201croot causes\u201d to the opioid epidemic.\n\nStarting in 2006, within six years, pharmaceutical giants pushed 76 billion oxycodone and hydrocodone pain pills in the country, which resulted in nearly 100,000 deaths, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.", "description": "The sister of an opioid overdose victim said on Tuesday that lawsuits against drug manufacturers and wholesalers accused of exacerbating the opioid epidemic give her \u201chope\u201d that the truth is coming out.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-17-at-9.18.34-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
