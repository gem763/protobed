The Champions League/European Cup, Europa League/UEFA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup. The other teams are Bayern Munich, Juventus and Manchester United. Ajax, the Eredivise champions and Champions League semi-finalists last season, present a severe test to Chelsea's strong European away form. They've won eight matches away from home in a row, a club record, scoring 12 goals and conceding just five. In 17 UEFA games, home and away, they have lost just once. To Valencia at home this season Erik ten Hag\u2019s men meanwhile have yet to lose in the Champions League this season and currently sit top of the Eredivise with four wins and a draw from their last five games.

In the opening group game they lost 1-0 at home to Valencia. But then they went to Lille and won to head in to this evening's game just three points behind last season's semi-finalist Ajax.
