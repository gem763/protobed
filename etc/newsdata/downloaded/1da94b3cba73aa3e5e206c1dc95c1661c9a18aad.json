Here are their plans to upend the $3.5 trillion industry.", "language": "en", "text": "Walmart is preparing to launch a massive push into healthcare, as the giant US retailer vies for a bigger slice of the $3.5 trillion US healthcare industry.\n\nThe retail giant plans to offer services such as primary care, counseling, home care, and dentistry, Sean Slovenski, Walmart's president of health and wellness, told Business Insider. Walmart is starting by opening \"prototype\" health centers in northern Georgia that could quickly make Walmart into the largest provider of basic healthcare in the region.\n\nThe goal, he said, is to do for healthcare what Walmart's supercenter stores did for retail: offer a breadth of services conveniently and at a much cheaper price point than rivals. For instance, a primary care visit costs $40, while a dental visit costs $25.\n\nSlovenski said the clinics are a big piece of the company's health strategy.\n\n\"We see these as being a crown jewel of what we want to accomplish in the physical world, in the home, and in the virtual world as well,\" Slovenski said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Walmart's built out its retail clinics. Walmart, which has more than 5,000 retail locations in the US, has been eyeing healthcare for more than a decade and previously announced ambitious health plans. While the company had planned in the past to have as many as 2,000 clinics open, it currently has about 20 clinics over three states.\n\nSlovenski acknowledged Walmart's past missteps and said the current push was a top priority for the company's senior leadership, including US CEO Greg Foran and CEO Doug McMillon.\n\n\"Like a lot of the retailers, everyone's eyes were bigger than their stomach when they bellied up to the buffet,\" he said. \"We finally got to the point this past year with the right strategy, the right team, and the right timing.\"\n\nRead more: Walmart is opening health clinics, but that's just the start.
