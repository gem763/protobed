But we were initially very surprised to see what we did.\u201d\n\nThe discovery came from time spent collecting meltwater samples on Ellesmere Island, in Canada\u2019s Nunavut territory, where several glaciers flow into Lake Hazen. The team of researchers also gathered samples in the Rocky Mountains and Greenland.\n\n\u201cWe have a pretty good understanding of the state of glaciers globally,\u201d said St Pierre. \u201cOne thing we don\u2019t know much about is the meltwaters and what happens when it \u2026 flows into rivers and downstream lakes.\u201d\n\nIn temperate rivers, a bounty of organic material \u2013 plant life and fish \u2013 results in higher levels of decomposition, meaning the bodies of water emit a far greater amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than they absorb.\n\nBut glacial rivers, with their milky appearance and silt-laden composition, are not very hospitable to aquatic life, leading to far less organic decay \u2013 and little carbon output.\n\nAt the same time, the fine sediment scraped from glaciers, including silicate and carbonate, when tossed along in the rushing waters, begins the geological process known as chemical weathering.\n\n\u201cAs the rivers take up the particles, they start to mix within the water and within that water there are also gases, including carbon dioxide,\u201d said St Pierre. \u201cThe mixing together creates these reactions and puts all these different particles together. That\u2019s where we see that the net result is the sink of carbon dioxide.\u201d\n\nThe research team discovered the effect of chemical weathering in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere extended as far away as 26 miles (42km) from the headwaters of the river.\n\nThis means that during high melt periods, glacial river water will absorb 40 times as much carbon as the Amazon rainforest.\n\n\u201cOn a per-metre-squared basis, these rivers can consume a phenomenal amount of carbon dioxide,\u201d said St Pierre. But their limited size means on a gross scale, they pull in far less than the sprawling Amazon. The team plan on sampling meltwaters in the Canadian Rockies, and expect to find similar results.\n\nIn a rapidly changing climate, the findings provide a surprisingly optimistic message: there are often unseen or underappreciated ways in which the planet regulates carbon emissions. \u201cIt shows just how little we know about these systems,\u201d said St Pierre.\n\nBut the Vancouver-based biologist cautions that the short-term benefits of the newly discovered carbon sink also illustrate the rapid decline of glaciers in northern Canada.\n\n\u201cGlaciers are a finite resource. The waters that emanate from them are also a finite resource. And we\u2019re potentially losing something that we\u2019re deriving a lot of benefits from, before we actually fully understand it,\u201d said St Pierre.\n\nPrevious research into glacial retreat found that the massive bodies of ice and rock were shrinking at a rate far faster than initially predicted by scientists.\n\nLake Hazen, the subject of St Pierre\u2019s research, also makes for an interesting case study.\n\nIn research published last year in the journal Nature Communications, biologists discovered the lake, one of largest of the high Arctic, was changing at a dramatic rate. Since 2007, water entering the lake from melting glaciers has increased tenfold over historic flow rates. With the water comes sedimentation, the same particles responsible for removing carbon dioxide. Because of the cloudier water in the lake, researchers speculate that the char population is growing skinnier, with the fish finding it more difficult to navigate the murky waters.\n\nAs warming in the Canadian Arctic accelerates at a rate faster than the rest of the planet, St Pierre hopes that it isn\u2019t too late for the public to understand the stakes for the region.\n\n\u201cWithin the context of climate change, we\u2019re losing systems that are just spectacular for the people who actually get to see them,\u201d said St Pierre. \u201cAnd our hope is that people really see why this science is important.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Total surprise\u2019 discovery overturns conventional understanding of rivers", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8ea90ae9f503aa1c98fd35dbf13235b1207fea/0_490_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4de0b9d9784bc6f0e5acf495e1fe5a57", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
