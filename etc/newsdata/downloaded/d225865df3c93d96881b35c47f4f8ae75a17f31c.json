Barcelona now leads Madrid by one point.\n\nBarcelona enjoyed its best away match of the season.\n\nGriezmann put Barcelona ahead in the 13th minute when Clement Lenglet met his run behind Eibar\u2019s high defensive line with a long ball that left him alone to beat goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic.\n\nDmitrovic denied Messi before halftime, but couldn\u2019t do it again in the 58th after a passing combination by Su\u00e1rez and Griezmann set up Barcelona\u2019s all-time scorer in the area.\n\nThe three combined again in the 66th when Griezmann launched Messi with a through ball. Messi then slid the ball over for Su\u00e1rez to finish off on the break.\n\nErnesto Valverde\u2019s team has won five matches across all competitions after an erratic start to the season.\n\nBarcelona plays at Slavia Prague in the Champions League group phase on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lionel Messi teamed up with Antoine Griezmann and Luis Su\u00e1rez as Barcelona's big three all scored in a commanding 3-0 win at Eibar in the Spanish league on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/spain_soccer_la_liga_87549_c0-144-3468-2167_s1200x700.jpg?be6ae549c48dc55ae5f17dc2cdbe94afe9901d6a", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
