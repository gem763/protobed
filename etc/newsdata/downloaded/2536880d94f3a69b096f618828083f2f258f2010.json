A Reuters Tankan poll earlier on Thursday showed Japanese manufacturers' business outlook was less pessimistic in October while service-sector sentiment rose to a three-month high.\n\nSome consolation this week also came from household spending data, which rose for a ninth straight month in August, the longest such streak since comparable data became available in 2001, data on Tuesday showed.\n\nA bright spot in Thursday's data was a 21.3 per cent month-on-month jump in orders from overseas, the biggest rise since October 2015, though it was mainly driven by big-ticket items, including for railway cars and planes.\n\nStill, the outlook for Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, remains murky as manufacturers face challenges from prolonged contractions in exports and production.\n\nWhile the economy grew an annualised 1.3 per cent in the second quarter, some analysts have warned it could be left without growth drivers if domestic demand falters.\n\nThe Cabinet Office on Thursday maintained its assessment on machinery orders to say they are showing a pick up.\n\n\"There was a big rise in June and that was followed by a fall in July and August,\" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.\n\nBy sector, core orders from manufacturers fell 1.0 per cent in August from the previous month, declining again after rising in July, while those from the service-sector fell 8.0 per cent, the Cabinet Office data showed.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [TOKYO] Japan's core machinery orders slipped for the second consecutive month in August, suggesting deeper fissures in business investment and the broader economy from slowing global trade. .
