Marco Rubio Shrugs Off Trump's Call For China To Probe Biden As A Joke", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) appeared so very unconcerned Friday about Donald Trump calling on China to investigate his political rival Joe Biden that he had a difficult time presenting a coherent defense.\n\nTrump, speaking to reporters outside the White House on Thursday, urged China to investigate the former vice president, just hours before CNN reported that he had raised the \u201cpolitical prospects\u201d of Biden \u2014 and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 in a June phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump also repeated his call to Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son \u2014 the exact request he made on a phone call in July that drew a whistleblower complaint, leading the House to formally launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\nRubio suggested Trump was merely \u201cneedling\u201d the press Thursday. Rubio has been a longtime critic of China\u2019s autocratic government and its imprisonment and torture of dissidents.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a real request or him just needling the press, knowing that you guys were going to get outraged by it,\u201d he said at a Florida news conference. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty good at getting everyone fired up. The media responded right on task.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he did it to ... provoke you. He plays it like a violin, and everyone falls right into [it]. That\u2019s not a real request.\u201d\n\nFormer Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates tweeted Friday that she believes Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 proclaiming impeachable activities out loud \u2014 is a way to \u201chypnotize\u201d the American public and normalize his behavior.\n\nAfter being caught secretly strong arming Ukraine, POTUS is trying to hypnotize the American people into believing it can\u2019t be wrong if he says it out loud.And if he actually thinks he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to sic foreign powers on political rivals, he\u2019s even more dangerous. https://t.co/9AkwnlOzaG \u2014 Sally Yates (@SallyQYates) October 4, 2019\n\nTwitter wits had some other observations about Rubio.\n\nRubio, thy name is cowardice. https://t.co/awdQrxfC23 \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 4, 2019\n\nVertebrae-challenged, hypocritical political sycophants like Marco Rubio want us to think any time trump says something that crosses the line, \"Oh, he was joking.\"\n\n\n\nElection interference isn't a joke.\n\nBut the GOP is.\n\n\n\nWe should END their careers, so they can do stand-up. \u2014 BrooklynDad_Defiant Savage! (@mmpadellan) October 5, 2019\n\nWhat a coward you are. Let me tell you something Senator I am not media. I am a US citizen and I am pissed that you think its fine that the President is asking our enemies to go after his political rivals. What a pathetic little spineless person you've proven to be. \u2014 Fred Wellman (@FPWellman) October 4, 2019\n\n\"It was a joke\" is what you're going with, Marco? Does that mean if it turns out he wasn't kidding then you'll support impeachment? \u2014 Zelda (@TheyWereStolen) October 4, 2019\n\nFalse alarm, everyone. Trump didn't try to secretly conspire with foreign countries because he actually *wanted* them to interfere in 2020, he was just trying to rile up the press! It was all a joke!\n\n\n\nLook at Rubio's face. This is what losing your dignity in real time looks like. pic.twitter.com/B7ei52AJA4 \u2014 Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) October 4, 2019\n\nMarco 10:4\n\n\u201cAnd when finding one\u2019s self between the rock and the hard place, thou shalt dodge like a greased mofo.\u201d \u2014 TenaciousEye (@TenaciousEye) October 5, 2019\n\nPres. Trump urges China to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son\u2014even as he faces an impeachment inquiry for pushing Ukraine to do the same. https://t.co/dCTAOhQE2P pic.twitter.com/OdxJNRF2HE \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) October 3, 2019\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
