You can download the full report here.\n\nMajor changes are afoot for the digital marketing industry. Trends and influences prevalent in 2019 will continue to affect marketers in 2020 and beyond, leaving many with questions.\n\nWill the duopoly's hold finally start to dwindle?\n\nNo. In spite of mounting frustration and distrust from consumers and marketers, the latter will not turn away from the biggest players in the digital ad space.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 eMarketer Inc. .\n\nWhat will consumer demands for privacy and data control mean for marketers in 2019 and beyond?\n\nMarketers are going to have to prepare for impending regulation and heightened privacy concerns, whether they want to or not. This will mean scrutinizing their data collection practices and making sure they are meeting regulatory requirements and consumer expectations.\n\nWill the rollout of app-ads.txt happen in 2019?\n\nIt will, but adoption of the in-app version of ads.txt\u2014a text file on publishers' sites that lists vendors with permission to sell inventory\u2014won't flow to every corner, nor will it solve all the ad fraud woes that currently plague mobile app advertising.\n\nIs the identity graph in trouble?\n\nIn some ways, yes. Apple's ITP 2.2, continued ad avoidance, rises in falsified audience data sets and the California Consumer Privacy Act are all pulling at the strings of this fragile web.\n\nWill it be harder for advertisers to move dollars from TV to digital?\n\nActually, it will become easier, thanks to mergers and acquisitions over the past year and the growing efforts of big networks and broadcasters to iron out measurement inconsistencies between TV and digital. However, don't expect frequency capping issues to go away any time soon.\n\nThese are just a few of the questions, answers, and insights you'll get from Digital Display Advertising 2019: Nine Trends to Know for This Year's Media Plan.", "description": "In a new 2019 report, eMarketer outlines nine trends to know for this year's media plan in Digital Display Advertising.", "authors": ["Business Insider Intelligence"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d77eddb2e22af129f716470?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
