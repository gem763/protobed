To be one of the top Americans at that age is going to be tough.\n\n\u201cI went to my first Olympic Games when it was in Los Angeles (1984). So now to have the opportunity to be a part of the Olympics, because golf in my lifetime wasn\u2019t a part of the Olympics, is an important aspect for us and the growth of the game.\n\n\u201cThe game has become so global, and so reaching, that I think the Olympic Games is a great extension of that and I\u2019d like to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nWoods will get a taste of golf-crazy Japan when he competes in \u2018The Challenge: Japan Skins\u2019 on Oct 21.\n\nWoods will take part in a high-stakes challenge at the Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club in Chiba alongside Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama.\n\nThe extravaganza, which will in part be floodlit, is being televised globally by GOLFTV and will be played under the \u2018skins\u2019 format.\n\nThe format, designed to encourage aggressive play from start to finish, forces players to win a hole outright to take a \u201cskin\u201d, with tied holes resulting in a \u201cpush\u201d of the skin to the next hole.\n\nWoods, who won the Masters earlier this year to end an 11-year wait for his 15th Major, says he is thrilled to be back at the top of the sport after injuries caused four back surgeries between 2014 and 2017.\n\n\u201cTo be able to have played the last couple of years after where I was (with injury)... and to have two wins in my last two years \u2013 I definitely would not have foreseen that at the time, pre-surgery.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m just excited and ecstatic to be able to participate in golf at this level again. I missed it. I missed competing against these guys.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about now is that when I was out, there was a whole generation of guys that I didn\u2019t really compete against.\n\n\u201cWhether it was Jordan (Spieth), JT (Justin Thomas), Bryson (Dechambeau) or Patrick (Reed) these guys were just coming out and I missed that. Now they\u2019re established and I\u2019m coming back into the game, so it\u2019s been fun to compete against those guys, not to mention some of the older guys.\u201d\n\nIf he is to realise his Olympic dreams it seems likely Woods will be competing against players from this new generation to earn a spot at Tokyo.", "description": "Golfing great Tiger Woods is targeting the Tokyo Olympics as he seeks to add another glittering chapter to his storied career.", "authors": ["Ossian Shine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442162938&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0B0", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
