The Taiwanese semiconductor giant is also seeking \"substantial monetary damages\" but has not revealed a specific amount.\n\nThe 25 TSMC patents in the complaints relate to technologies such as FinFET designs, shallow trench isolation techniques, double patterning methods, advanced seal rings and gate structures, and innovative contact etch stop layer designs, TSMC said.\n\nThese technologies are used to create TSMC's 40nm, 28nm, 22nm, 14nm, and 12nm node processes.\n\n\"TSMC's patents reflect decades and tens of billions of dollars of investments in innovation, resulting in TSMC's significant contribution to advancements in semiconductor manufacturing technology,\" said Sylvia Fang, TSMC vice president and general counsel.\n\nThe lawsuits have been filed across various jurisdictions, including the United States, Singapore, and Germany.\n\nThe legal spat follows GlobalFoundries filing 25 legal complaints against TSMC last month, accusing the Taiwanese company of infringing 16 patents. TSMC's clients, which include Apple, Google, Broadcom, Motorola, Nvidia, Cisco, Lenovo, TCL, and Asus, were also named on GlobalFoundries' complaints as they imported TSMC's semiconductors that allegedly infringed the patents.\n\n\"For years, while we have been devoting billions of dollars to domestic research and development, TSMC has been unlawfully reaping the benefits of our investments. This action is critical to halt Taiwan Semiconductor's unlawful use of our vital assets and to safeguard the American and European manufacturing base,\" GlobalFoundries said at the time.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nGlobalFoundries wants import bans on Apple, Google, Cisco products in TSMC fight\n\nLegal stoush against TSMC alleges the infringement of 16 of GlobalFoundries' patents.\n\nAMD's 2nd-gen EPYC continues epic market momentum\n\nNew platforms and new customers for what has become the go-to server chip.\n\nInside GlobalFoundries' long road to the leading edge\n\nA recent tour of the company's remarkable fab in upstate New York illustrated both how far the foundry has come and how challenging the future will be for advanced chipmakers.\n\nAMD's 16-core Ryzen 9 3950X hits 4.7 GHz in turbo at only 105W TDP (TechRepublic)\n\nThe advantages of AMD and TSMC's 7nm production process are on full display with the newly-announced CPU.\n\nHardware and software vendors continue to flee Huawei following blacklisting (TechRepublic)\n\nJust over one week after an executive order prohibiting US companies from selling products to Huawei, the world's third largest smartphone manufacturer finds itself with few friends.", "description": "It follows the Taiwanese company being sued by GlobalFoundries last month.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/18/24961729-3f26-11e4-b6a0-d4ae52e95e57/thumbnail/770x578/df8a1b0fb34a5c4a5824e84b68e24ffe/apple-shifting-a6x-processor-production-from-samsung-to-tsmc-report.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
