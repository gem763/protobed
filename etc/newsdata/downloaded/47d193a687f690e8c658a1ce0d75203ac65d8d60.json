Gonorrhea more than doubled over the past 10 years from 611 to 1,496 cases. Syphilis infections increased to 180 cases from 38 a decade ago, officials said.\n\nMore connections with many more people are made rapidly through online dating services, officials said.\n\n\u201cAs people rely on digital means of making connections, it can lead to circumstances where they might be more exposed to infection without them knowing it,\u201d said Gerald Hasty, program coordinator for the state harm reduction branch. \u201cMore partners, more chances to get infections.\u201d\n\nThere has also been decreasing reliance on condoms or prophylactics for protection against acquiring or spreading STDs, officials said.\n\nThe Hawaii figures correspond with the national rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis infections, which have risen for the fifth year in a row, officials said.\n\nThe increase is \u201cnot desirable, but it\u2019s also not unexpected.\u201d\n\nThe three infections do not cause distinct or troubling early symptoms so those who are infected have \u201cabsolutely no idea of it,\u201d Hasty said.\n\n\u201cThat sets the stage for the infections to be spread,\u201d Hasty said. \u201cLack of regular screenings or routine screenings contributes to increasing rates.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An increase in sexually transmitted diseases in Hawaii to the highest numbers reported in decades can be linked to the prevalence of online dating, officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
