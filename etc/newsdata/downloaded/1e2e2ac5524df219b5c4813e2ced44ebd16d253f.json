Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 is about 60% bigger.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan for a wealth tax attaches his name to one of the most salient tax ideas in Democratic circles that Warren, one of his main presidential primary opponents, has popularized.\n\nStruggling to maintain his top-three position in voter preference polls, Sanders follows Warren in proposing a tax that has becoming a popular rallying cry of \u201c2 cents\u201d during her campaign speeches. The cries refer to the 2% levy that would kick in on the assets of fortunes worth more than $50 million. Sanders\u2019 tax goes a few steps further -- taxing wealth above $32 million at 1%, with an increasing rate that tops out at 8% over $10 billion.\n\n\u201cThis is the Sanders response to the Warren surge: My plan is bigger than yours,\u201d said Brad Bannon, a Democratic political consultant. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to out-progressive each other.\u201d\n\nWarren has topped the Democratic field in polls of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to hold nominating contests next February. Part of that rise comes from support for her wealth tax that she says would raise $2.75 trillion over a decade and pay for universal child care, free college and student-debt elimination.\n\nSanders\u2019 tax would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over a decade.\n\nThe two are competing to be the top progressive candidate to challenge former Vice President Joe Biden, a moderate. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has for years spoken about income inequality and the problem of so many \u201cmillionaires and billionaires,\u201d and he has proposed taxes and regulations that until this election have been outside the mainstream of Democratic politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a campaign. People outbid each other,\u201d said Gordon Gray, the director of fiscal policy at American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. \u201cThis is the left\u2019s version of Republicans vying to have the biggest tax cut in 2016. Instead, it\u2019s bigger tax increases.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Democrats were having much different -- and less ambitious -- discussions in 2016, as well. Hillary Clinton proposed about $1.4 trillion in tax increases when she ran against Sanders, with slight increases for top earners and businesses. Sanders proposed $13.6 trillion in tax hikes but both campaigns focused on raising rates of existing taxes, rather than introducing expansive new levies on the richest Americans.\n\nIn this election, nearly every campaign is talking about significantly higher taxes on wealthy with a greatly expanded estate tax, a new tax on Wall Street trades and a significant hike on capital gains income by taxing it the same as wages.\n\nWarren and Sanders are both campaigning on a universal Medicare-For-All plan that would require at least $30 trillion in tax increases, plus more if they want to pursue other social programs, such as universal childcare and renewable energy programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing such a dramatic change in the debate,\u201d Steve Wamhoff, the director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said. \u201cThere is a lot of agreement on the principle of wealth tax, though the average American may not differentiate between the two plans.\u201d\n\nSander\u2019s plan could come with many of the same downsides that critics have pointed to in Warren\u2019s plan: It would likely face constitutionality questions, it could be difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to enforce, and wealthy individuals would likely find ways to minimize their tax bills or escape the tax altogether. And that\u2019s assuming it could get through Congress, which is unlikely.\n\nSander\u2019s larger version of the wealth tax would likely compound some of those downsides -- a more expensive tax means that people would be even more motivated to avoid it, Gray added.\n\nSanders called such people unpatriotic.\n\n\u201cLook, if rich people want to run away from the United States because we are asking them to pay their fair share of taxes, that shows the level of love that they have for this country, which apparently is not very much,\u201d Sanders said while campaigning with union workers in Iowa. \u201cI hope that the billionaires understand that it is these guys -- the working class of this country -- that made them their money.\u201d\n\nThe higher rates would also winnow down fortunes faster, meaning that the tax would raise less tax revenue in future, Gray said. And winnowing down fortunes is part of Sanders\u2019 stated goal -- he said he wanted to halve Americans\u2019 billionaires\u2019 wealth in 15 years.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax proposal is big.
