It\u2019s almost strange to have to write those words explicitly because after everything that has happened with this phone / tablet hybrid, you\u2019d like to think that everybody would know the score already. The review units that broke, the launch that was delayed, the newly fixed version, the sky-high price \u2014 all of it is well-known and well-documented. But Samsung is selling the Fold, albeit in very limited quantities, as though it is perfectly normal and reasonable to stroll into an AT&T store and buy a fragile, experimental device for $1,980.\n\nIt\u2019s not. But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t interesting things to learn from looking at the Galaxy Fold \u2014 again. I\u2019ve already reviewed the Galaxy Fold once in some depth, publishing it just before Samsung canceled the original launch. I won\u2019t go into as much detail here as I did then because less has changed than you might expect. Six months later, and it is awkwardly crammed into my pocket once again, fixed up to make it less likely to be destroyed by random debris.\n\nAnd no, this one hasn\u2019t broken, even after a few weeks of regular use.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold is a science experiment, just one that you could theoretically buy. The purpose of any science experiment is to test a hypothesis. With the Fold, the hypothesis is that a flexible OLED screen could successfully turn into a consumer product. From that perspective, the experiment is a success because I can confirm that the hypothesis is false. Foldable screens aren\u2019t ready yet.\n\nBut there\u2019s another hypothesis Samsung has \u2014 perhaps inadvertently \u2014 proposed: a phone that\u2019s bigger on the inside is actually a good idea.\n\nAs we have reported before, Samsung has made fairly minor tweaks to the hardware in an effort to prevent damage to the delicate screen. The most important is that it extended the factory-installed screen protector out to the edges so it\u2019s covered by the plastic bezels and won\u2019t tempt anybody to peel it off.\n\nWhile that change might protect against users doing the wrong thing, it doesn\u2019t do much more than that. The plastic is still really soft and can easily get dinged up. My unit has some visible indentations from when I scrolled too quickly without realizing my fingernail was pressing on the screen. Samsung\u2019s new unboxing experience includes an optional concierge to walk you through the many, many warnings that now come in the box. Among those warnings is to keep fingernails away from the screen. Whoops.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of warnings now in the Galaxy Fold\u2019s box\n\nSamsung\u2019s other hardware changes involve keeping debris from getting into the hinge mechanism. There are plastic caps where the screen bends, tighter tolerances in the gaps around the hinge, and even the gap when the whole thing is closed is smaller now. Plus, if any debris does get into the hinge (which is what happened to my first review unit), there\u2019s a metal layer between it and the screen.\n\nIs all that enough? I don\u2019t know. Nobody knows. People have definitely busted Galaxy Fold units since the rerelease. I didn\u2019t bust mine in the few weeks that I had it, but I was also terrified that I would if I wasn\u2019t careful. I didn\u2019t go live in a bubble like Joanna Stern at The Wall Street Journal did, but I treated the thing tenderly and carefully \u2014 more so than anybody should have to with a phone, even one that costs $2,000.\n\nSamsung is offering a one-time screen replacement within the first year for $150. That\u2019s nice, I guess, but at this point, the only people buying the Fold are going to be the kinds of Samsung super-fans that are surely worth more than $150 to the company.\n\nAnyway, the reality is that, as it exists in the Galaxy Fold, the flexible screen is going to be delicate, and you are going to need to treat it delicately. Using it will impinge on your life in ways a more durable phone \u2014 or even carrying both a phone and a tablet \u2014 won\u2019t.\n\nSo far as I can tell, the only software change of note on the Galaxy Fold is that Samsung mapped the Bixby assistant to the power button instead of the (still oddly separate) fingerprint sensor. Everything else is the same.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly bad news, but it\u2019s mostly not Samsung\u2019s fault. Android still suffers from an identity crisis any time it\u2019s on a screen larger than seven inches. Many apps stay open when you switch from the small screen to the big, but just as many don\u2019t. Some apps look nice both expanded up on the big screen and work reasonably well on the tiny front screen; many more do not.\n\nAgree to continue: Samsung Galaxy Fold Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. To use the Samsung Galaxy Fold, you must agree to: The End User License Agreement\n\nSamsung\u2019s Privacy Policy\n\nGoogle Terms of Service (including Privacy Policy)\n\nGoogle Play Terms of Service There are many optional agreements. As I was using the AT&T version of the Galaxy Fold, there were more than I expected. Here are just a few of them: Samsung \u201cInformation Linking\u201d\n\nGoogle Drive backup, Location services, W-Fi Scanning, diagnostic data\n\nAutomatic installs (including from Google, Samsung, and your carrier)\n\nAT&T\u2019s myAT&T Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAT&T Wi-Fi calling Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAT&T Visual Voicemail Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nSamsung Data Transfer Terms of Service There may be others. For example, I already had a Samsung account, so I didn\u2019t need to agree to more terms for that. AT&T preinstalls something like 20 apps on the Galaxy Fold, any one of which could include yet more terms of service. Samsung\u2019s Weather app also has its own privacy policy that may include sharing information with weather.com. Final tally: all told, there are four mandatory agreements and about 10 optional ones I expect most users will want to agree to.\n\nSamsung can\u2019t solve all of those problems, but I do wish it had tried to iterate more on the multi-window setup. You can technically tile three apps on the screen and have pop-over app windows on top of them if you like. But in practice, using anything more than basic split-screen is a huge hassle. That\u2019s not a problem in and of itself; only power users could possibly want more than two apps visible on the Fold\u2019s 7.3-inch screen.\n\nBut even just split-screening apps on the Fold feels awkward and jittery compared to the multi-window options on the iPad (and forget about comparing any of this to Windows). iPadOS\u2019 Slide Over just feels much more natural, and the animations are much smoother. Android as a platform has some way to go.\n\nThe other thing that hasn\u2019t changed is how awkward the Fold is when it\u2019s closed up. I didn\u2019t expect this, but if the main thing that kept me from wanting to use the Fold wasn\u2019t the fragile screen, it was how annoying it was to carry around. It\u2019s too thick to comfortably fit in a pocket, and it\u2019s too tall as well.\n\nWhen I reviewed the Fold back in April, that awkwardness was kind of intriguing. It meant that I used the phone less because I wouldn\u2019t want to bother with the tiny screen. When I did unfold it and really use it, I was much more engaged. It turned the Fold into a device I actively chose to use instead of a device that invisibly stole my time by tempting me to scroll through social media all day.\n\nI still feel that way about the Fold, but it goes too far. I do want a good screen that I can hold in one hand on the subway. It might cause me to lose an hour to Twitter, but that\u2019s on me.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold forces you to make too many compromises. You have to compromise on durability, on having a phone you can fit in your pocket, and, most of all, on price. All of those compromises exist solely to get you the flexible screen, which is itself compromised because it still has that crease down the middle.\n\nThis got me thinking: what if instead of a crease down the middle, the screen was just split? You\u2019d lose having a seamless canvas across which to splay a window, but you\u2019d theoretically be getting rid of all those other compromises. A split-screen phone could be thinner, have a more pocketable shape, be more durable, and be cheaper.\n\nThere have been split-screen phones in the past, and there are even some coming out right now. The LG G8X is one example. If the software was good (by which I mean supported at the Android platform level), a dual-screen device could get you a lot of the benefits of the Galaxy Fold with fewer of the problems. You\u2019d miss out on the futurism, but you\u2019d get something more usable.\n\nA phone that\u2019s bigger on the inside is still a good idea, but nobody\u2019s figured out how to do it yet\n\nThat seems to be the thinking behind Microsoft\u2019s Surface Duo, but that won\u2019t be available for another year. That\u2019s probably for the best since I suspect it\u2019ll take that long for Android and app developers to get ready.\n\nThe day before I published this review, Samsung teased another folding phone, this time with a vertical form factor like the clamshell phones of old. There\u2019s no timetable for releasing it, but here\u2019s my advice: wait until the screen can be made of glass or some other more durable material.\n\nAs for the Galaxy Fold, don\u2019t buy one. But you should go to a store and play with one. As an experience, there\u2019s a there there, if you know what I mean, even though the screen technology and software clearly aren\u2019t there yet.", "description": "Samsung has rereleased the $1,980 Galaxy Fold, claiming that it fixed the issues that caused the screen of the previous Android smartphone-tablet hybrid model to break in the first place.
