Her winning time of two hours, 32 minutes, 43 seconds was the slowest ever to win the world championships.\n\nStill, it was enough for a comfortable victory over Bahrain\u2019s defending world champion Rose Chelimo, who settled for silver crossing more than a minute adrift.\n\nNamibia\u2019s Helalia Johannes completed the podium taking the bronze.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the win and bringing back the gold to Kenya,\u201d said Chepngetich. \u201cIt was a tough race but I knew what to expect as I ran in Dubai.\n\n\u201cI trained for this weather running in the afternoon when the sun was high.\n\n\u201cI want to win another for Kenya in Tokyo.\u201d\n\nThe opening day of the 10-day event began with the governing International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) issuing a statement that the marathon would go ahead despite concerns over extreme heat and athlete welfare.\n\nAs temperatures hovered in the mid-30s Celsius the runners waited their turn in the spotlight as the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach sitting on one side and IAAF boss Sebastian Coe on the other, declared the championships open to an explosion of fireworks.\n\nWith the first gold medal of the championships up for grabs the women stepped up to the start line ready to tackle a steamy 26.2 miles (42.195 km) floodlit course along the waterfront of Doha\u2019s famous Corniche promenade.\n\nThe race scheduled to begin one minute before midnight on Friday and finish in the early hours of Saturday saw the field head out right on the stroke of 12.\n\nThe midnight start tempered the sting of a searing sun but with the temperature sitting at 32.7C and the humidity index at 73% the conditions were right on the limit of what the IAAF said were allowable.\n\nDespite IAAF assurances that athlete welfare was the top priority, some felt the conditions were so severe that the race should not have been run.\n\n\u201cThe humidity kills you,\u201d said Volha Mazuronak of Belarus. \u201cThere is nothing to breathe. I thought I wouldn\u2019t finish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disrespect towards the athletes.\n\n\u201cA bunch of high-ranked officials gathered and decided that it would take (the championships) here but they are sitting in the cool and they are probably sleeping right now.\u201d\n\nWith the city\u2019s skyscrapers providing a sparkling backdrop, the runners set out on the first of six laps of the seven kilometre circuit with Sardana Trofimova, one of a handful of Russian athletes cleared to compete in Doha as an Authorised Neutral Athlete (ANA) setting the early pace.\n\nBut by the end of the first loop it was Chepngetich and Chelimo leading the way.\n\nAt 10km Chepngetich upped the pace, blowing apart the field but made her move too early and the Kenyan was reeled back in by the chasing pack that included team mates double world champion Edna Kiplagat and Visiline Jepkesho.\n\nAs the race reached the midway mark the gold medal battle had been reduced to a group of five; Chepngetich, Kiplagat, Jepkesho, Chelimo and Namibia\u2019s Helalia Johannes.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nBehind the leaders the carnage began to mount as runner after runner succumbed to the brutal conditions while others were being lapped.\n\nThe pace also began to cause damage up front: Jepkesho dropped from the leading pack, trimming the medal contenders to four.\n\nWith the bell for final lap ringing Chepngetich made a devastating move, splintering the leading pack and galloping home for a decisive victory.", "description": "Kenya's Ruth Chepngetich overcame extreme heat and humidity to win the world championship midnight marathon on Friday, in a gruelling test of survival that saw nearly a third of the 70 starters fail to reach the finish line.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434711452&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q21J", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
