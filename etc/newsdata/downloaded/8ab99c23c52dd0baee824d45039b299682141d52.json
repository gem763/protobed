Could it affect flights?", "language": "en", "text": "The FAA is ordering airlines to inspect heavily used versions of its Boeing 737 NG models for cracks in wing supports, a move that creates another Boeing headache for carriers and potentially travelers.\n\nThe order, issued Wednesday, requires initial and periodic inspections for cracking and repairs if any cracking is found.\n\nThough not an emergency order that will immediately ground planes, the order covers nearly 2,000 737s registered in the U.S. and represents another blow to airlines already reeling from the prolonged grounding of the newest version of the 737, the Max, after two crashes in five months.\n\nThe new order raises the prospect airlines could have to take planes out of service if cracks are found, which could lead to flight cancellations.\n\nThe FAA said just 165 of the planes covered by the order will need to be inspected within seven days. The inspections are only expected to take about an hour per plane. The remaining planes covered by the order will need to be inspected as they hit certain flight thresholds.\n\nThe FAA said the order is based on reports of cracking on multiple Boeing 737-800s as the planes were being converted from passenger service to cargo planes. If not addressed, the FAA said the impact of the cracking could \"adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane and result in loss of control of the airplane.\"\n\nA Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700 passenger jet taxis on the tarmac after arriving at Los Angeles International Airport on April 5, 2011 in Los Angeles, California. More\n\nThe FAA's new order focuses only on the version of the 737 called the NG, which stands for Next Generation. It is more commonly known as the Boeing 737-600, -700, -800 and -900. It was one of the most popular versions of the 737; more than 7,000 have been sold.\n\nIts problem, unrelated to the issues that grounded the Max, involves cracks that have appeared in components that attach the wings to the fuselage on planes that have been flown a lot.\n\nBoeing \"discovered the cracks while conducting modifications on a heavily used aircraft,\" the FAA said in a statement earlier this week. \"Subsequent inspections uncovered similar cracks in a small number of additional planes.\" The part is called a pickle fork.\n\nSouthwest Airlines, which only flies Boeing 737s, has about 700 NGs in its fleet. The airline said it began inspecting the planes on Tuesday and will fully comply with the FAA order in the time frames the agency has laid out.\n\nSouthwest has not yet disclosed how many of its Boeing 737-700 and 737-800s will be impacted by the order, including the number that will have to be inspected within a week.\n\nSpokeswoman Brandy King said the airline plans to perform overnight inspections on the impacted planes and, as a result, does not expect \"any customer impacts or disruptions to our operations.'' Southwest does not operate late-night flights, including red-eye flights.\n\nAn emergency inspection of engine fan blades after a passenger died on a Southwest flight in 2018 led to some flight cancellations by the airline.", "description": "Inspections were ordered to look for cracks in wing supports of heavily used 737 NGs.
