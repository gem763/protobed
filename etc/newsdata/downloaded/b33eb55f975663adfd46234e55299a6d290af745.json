Should he lead his team to victory on Saturday, said Habana, it would have a similar impact to Nelson Mandela's famous appearance at Rugby World Cup 1995.\n\n\u201cIf South Africa go on and win with Siya Kolisi as the captain, it will be absolutely monumental,\" said Habana before the tournament started.\n\n\u201cFor us as a country to have that inspiration, for 70% of our population to have that example, would be immensely important, on a par with Mandela in \u201995 if not greater. It would be historic.\u201d\n\nThe Springboks' opponents back in October 2007 were, as now, England.\n\n\u201cI was watching it in a tavern, because I didn\u2019t have a TV at home,\" said Kolisi.\n\n\"I know what it did for us back then. I have never seen people come together over sport (like that).\u201d\n\nKolisi \"never dreamed of being a rugby player\" as a child and now says the sport was \"my way out\". He was brought up by his paternal grandmother, and was more worried about whether he was going to eat on any given day.\n\nBut after trying rugby for the first time aged seven he soon excelled and he left township rugby behind when he was awarded a bursary at top Port Elizabeth school Grey High. His roots are still in Zwide, though.\n\nIn an interview in the Japanese media before the Rugby World Cup he said, \"It\u2019s tough to stay on the right path because sometimes hunger makes you do things that you never thought you would do. Some of my friends would steal and some passed away because they got into bad things.\u201d\n\nKolisi played for local club African Bombers when he was free from school rugby duties.\n\nBoth Habana and Kolisi have spoken about the sense of togetherness that binds the current team.\n\nSpringboks' coach Rassie Erasmus gave Kolisi his first professional contract when he was 18.\n\n\"I've known him for a while. He has coached a lot of the guys from different (provincial) unions, so he knows us and has had to pull us together. We had to buy into his plan, and he has made it clear that the Springboks is the most important thing.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we tried to build ourselves by our social media, and all those kinds of things. He just brought us back down to earth, and told us \u2018You have to play well first, and everything else will come\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see it come together.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old Kolisi, who will earn his 50th Test cap in the final, has endeared himself to South Africa\u2019s rugby fan base with his interaction on social media. He was at it again when he took a video in the changing room after the semi-final, surrounded by his team-mates, to express his gratitude for all the support from back home.", "description": "It is 12 years since South Africa became a country united by a Rugby World Cup final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7982/83756d4d1bd54f70be6a794b5535f437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
