Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies, UBS, Credit Suisse, Guggenheim, Stifel, William Blair and Loop Capital Markets also rated the stock a buy.\n\n\u201cThese are just SmileDirect\u2019s underwriters hyping their own offering,\u201d said Nathan Anderson, Founder of Hindenburg Research and author of a report published Friday that questioned the company\u2019s \u201cteledentistry\u201d model, highlighted its losses and predicted financial headwinds from regulatory, legal and customer satisfaction liabilities.\n\n\u201cJP Morgan led the IPO, so not surprisingly it has the rosiest price target.

Customers can either get a free 3-D image of their teeth taken at a so-called Smile Shop or buy a kit online to make an impression of their teeth that they can mail to SmileDirect. The company then develops and ships the clear aligners \u2014 a form of dental braces \u2014 back, and the customer undergoes a five- to 10-month treatment plan.\n\n\u201cThe company sets itself apart from both traditional orthodontics players and direct-to-consumer competitors with (1) the convenience and ease of access it provides over the traditional orthodontics business model; (2) affordable product offerings; (3) a seamless in-house financing option; and (4) complete vertical integration, which drives a best-in-class patient experience,\u201d JPMorgan analysts led by Robbie Marcus wrote in a note to clients.\n\nRead also: Why 37 million people in the U.S. don\u2019t have dental coverage \u2014 and the painful price they pay\n\nThe addressable market for straightening teeth is significant, said the note, with less than 1% of the company\u2019s target market receiving care and a multiyear runway for growth. \u201cWe see a clear path to sustained top-line growth at an almost 50% 2018-23 CAGR, which we view as conservative,\u201d said the note.\n\nStifel analyst Jonathan Block agreed that there is demand for the product, although he acknowledged challenges.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, our checks among consumers identified areas of dissatisfaction, as customer service and lack of oversight [by a medical professional] were issues for a subset of respondents,\u201d Block wrote. \u201cThat said, we saw relatively solid ratings for the overall SDC experience despite these shortcomings, as a straighter smile and whiter teeth at a $2,000 price point seemingly resonated with the majority of the company\u2019s customers.\u201d\n\nHindenburg\u2019s Anderson wrote that the company has attracted more than 1,200 Better Business Bureau complaints in its five years of existence, and some of its practices have been deemed illegal by dental boards in Alabama and Georgia. Medical organizations, including the American Dental Association and the American Association of Orthodontists, have alleged that the company is endangering patients and is practicing medicine illegally, he wrote.\n\nThe company\u2019s approach claims it requires no meetings with dentists or orthodontists, although dentists and orthodontists maintain that thorough oral exams are needed before undergoing any orthodontic procedure.\n\nSee: Are dentists hooking patients on opioids?\n\n\u201cWe communicated with one customer who was forced to use wire cutters to remove SDC products after he struggled to breathe,\u201d said the report. \u201cReview sites are replete with other horror stories of customers who had to take emergency dentistry into their own hands.\u201d\n\nFor more on Hindenburg\u2019s report: SmileDirectClub\u2019s stock falls and then recovers after scathing report from short seller | Read the report at HindenburgResearch.com\n\nSmileDirect responded on Friday with a lengthy statement that hit out at \u201corganized dentistry\u201d and its \u201canticompetitive legal actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will vigorously defend ourselves and our business model in order to continue to pursue our company\u2019s mission to increase access to affordable, safe and convenient teeth straightening solutions,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe company is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on November 12.
