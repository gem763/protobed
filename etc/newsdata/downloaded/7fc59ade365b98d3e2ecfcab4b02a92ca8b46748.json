After being called out on the facts, the paper issued a correction on their story and admitted the claims of sexual misconduct weren't remembered by the alleged \"victim.\" Instead, the claims were made up and pushed to the media by a Washington D.C. attorney close to the Clintons.\n\nEditors\u2019 Note: Sept. 15, 2019\n\nAn earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\n\nBefore the correction, the false NYT story prompted a number of 2020 Democrats to further smear Kavanaugh and call for his impeachment.\n\nI sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.\n\n\n\nHe must be impeached. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 15, 2019\n\nThis new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin. (2/2) \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) September 16, 2019\n\nYesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh\u2014one we didn't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I. to rush its investigation to save his nomination. We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached. \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 15, 2019\n\nLet us never forget what courage looks like. pic.twitter.com/2bRD8s8sda \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) September 15, 2019\n\nLast year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 15, 2019\n\nThe revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019\n\nAll of these tweets are still up. In fact, Harris proudly pinned hers to the top of her profile and is doubling down.\n\nThe reality of Kavanaugh's confirmation process is that it lacked any integrity \u2014 there has never been a meaningful investigation into these allegations. We need the truth. https://t.co/M6u5sshPWc \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 16, 2019\n\nAs a reminder, not single accusation against Kavanaugh had evidence or corroboration.\n\n\"After an extensive investigation that included the thorough review of all potentially credible evidence submitted and interviews of more than 40 individuals with information relating to the allegations, including classmates and friends of all those involved, Committee investigators found no witness who could provide any verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations brought against Justice Kavanaugh,\" a Senate Judiciary report, released in November 2018, states. \"In other words, following the separate and extensive investigations by both the Committee and the FBI, there was no evidence to substantiate any of the claims of sexual assault made against Justice Kavanaugh.\"", "description": ".09/16/2019 19:10:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/1831f493-66c1-4e34-b590-75f29543808b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
