Words keep getting in the way.", "language": "en", "text": "Six months into his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden is still delivering uneven performances on the debate stage and on the campaign trail in ways that can undermine his message. He takes circuitous routes to the ends of sentences, if he finishes them at all. He sometimes says the opposite of what he means (\u201cI would eliminate the capital gains tax \u2014 I would raise the capital gains tax\u201d he said in this month\u2019s debate). He has mixed up countries, cities and dates, embarked on off-message asides and sometimes he simply cuts himself off.\n\nThat choppy speaking style puts Mr. Biden at a disadvantage as his front-runner status erodes and he confronts growing pressure to expand his appeal with voters and donors. He faces intensifying competition for moderate support, a formidable liberal foe in Elizabeth Warren, attacks on his family by Mr. Trump and Republicans, and a troubling cash crunch.\n\nAt a time when he most needs to convey confidence and forcefulness, some Democrats say, he is instead getting in his own way.\n\n\u201cHe does not do well speaking where he isn\u2019t giving a speech,\u201d said Chris Henning, the Democratic chair in Greene County, Iowa, who caucused for Mr. Biden when he ran for president in 2008. \u201cHe\u2019s not good in debates and he comes across like he\u2019s stumbling around, trying to figure out what he\u2019s going to say.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Joe-Biden-Debate-Gaffes.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
