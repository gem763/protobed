There are those who will frown upon another overseas appointment... I\u2019m not of that number.\u201d\n\nAtherton said Kirsten\u2019s immediate focus would be to provide the structure needed to improve fourth-ranked England\u2019s standing in test cricket.\n\n\u201cThe one-day team is in good shape and runs itself under Eoin Morgan, while the test team are in need of some tender loving care,\u201d Atherton added.\n\n\u201cThe captain, Joe Root, (is) in need of a coach to apply greater structure than the free-wheeling Bayliss was apt to do. South Africans love a bit of structure.\u201d\n\nKirsten\u2019s former South Africa team mate Lance Klusener, who was named Afghanistan head coach last week, echoed Atherton\u2019s views.\n\n\u201cHe brings winning, so that for me is vitally important,\u201d Klusener told the BBC.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys that when he does stand up and speak, people tend to listen, and he\u2019s had that ability since I used to play with him.\u201d", "description": "Former South Africa batsman Gary Kirsten would be the perfect candidate to replace Trevor Bayliss as England coach and the country's cricket board should not hesitate to make another overseas appointment, former captain Michael Atherton said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436556771&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920HM"}
