He has a defensive mindset and I know him very well,\n\n\u201cHe can be a strong coach for Pakistan in Tests as he had proved himself often in red-ball cricket,\u201d the former cricketer highlighted.\n\nTalking about giving yet another chance to Umar Akmal and Ahmed Shahzad, Ali straight-forwardly asked the think tank to say goodbye to such players.\n\n\u201cIf you remember that during the World Cup 2019 I had said to put aside Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik as there is a lot of talent in Pakistan. I repeat the same thing for Akmal and Shahzad,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that Shahzad and Akmal once again failed to get off the mark. Akmal couldn\u2019t make a single run in two matches while Shahzad managed to score just 17 in two innings.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Pakistan's former Test cricketer Basit Ali thinks that Misbah-ul-Haq can't prove himself in T20I cricket due to his defensive mindset.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Basit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
