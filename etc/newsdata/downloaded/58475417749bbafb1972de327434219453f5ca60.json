Kyari repeated NNPC\u2019s assertion that there was no explosion.\n\n\u201cIt was a rupture on one of our pipelines,\u201d Kyari said on Twitter, adding that engineers were at the site already.\n\nHe said they had contained a spill and would fix the pipeline within three days.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no cause for alarm,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pipeline is near Oil Mining Licence 34, owned by NNPC subsidiary Nigeria Petroleum Development Co. and ND Western. That licence produces an average of 17,000 barrels per day of oil and condensates and 390 million standard cubic feet per day of gas.\n\nGas processed from the field goes into the Escravos-Lagos Pipeline, which feeds Egbin power plant, the largest in Nigeria.\n\nIt is also near NPDC asset OML 65, which produces as much as 12,000 bpd of crude oil from the Abura field.\n\nKyari also said the incident would not impact the country\u2019s power supply.", "description": "A pipeline that ruptured on Friday in Nigeria's Delta state spilled oil, but has been contained, the head of state oil company NNPC said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1424995809&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801BO-OZATP"}
