We therefore respectfully urge legislators not to enact these sanctions,\" Shell's Cremers said in emailed comments.\n\nRussian gas producer Gazprom leads the project while other participants, including Shell, Germany's Uniper and Wintershall, Austria's OMV and France's Engie, provide financial support.\n\nOMV has also publicly voiced its support for Nord Stream 2.\n\nThe project will double the annual capacity of the existing Nord Stream pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres and account for more than half of Russia's piped gas exports to Europe, allowing it to bypass Ukraine, currently its main transit route.\n\nIn the wake of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, its relations with Ukraine have soured and the European Commission has stepped up calls for member states to reduce their reliance on Russian energy imports.", "description": "The Trump administration says the project would strengthen Russia's economic grip on Europe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/454fe0af16be4cc9a766f49cb2ddd708_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
