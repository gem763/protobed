The suit filed in federal court in Manhattan by \u201cJane Doe\u201d appears to be the first brought by one of the three unidentified minor victims featured in the criminal indictment charging Mr. Epstein in July.\n\nMr. Epstein was found dead Aug. 10 in a jail cell in Manhattan, where he was held as he faced the federal sex-trafficking charges. His will was filed in the U.S. Virgin Islands the following week; Mr. Epstein\u2019s longtime personal lawyer Darren Indyke and his accountant Richard Kahn are the executors of the estate, which court filings estimated to be worth at least $577 million.\n\nWednesday\u2019s lawsuit\u2014which alleges sexual assault, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress\u2014names Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn as defendants, in their capacities as the estate\u2019s executors.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nJane Doe was identified as Minor Victim-1 in the criminal indictment filed against Mr. Epstein in July, according to the lawsuit. According to the suit, Jane Doe was contacted in March by authorities investigating Mr. Epstein\u2019s alleged decadeslong scheme to recruit and abuse children. The woman \u201cconfidentially cooperated with the investigation, recounting Epstein\u2019s abuse in painstaking detail over the course of many meetings,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nMr. Epstein was arrested in July. The two-count indictment against him was dismissed after his death.\n\nThe July indictment said little about Minor Victim-1 except that she was about 14 years old in 2002, when she allegedly was recruited to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Wednesday goes into graphic detail about the circumstances of Jane Doe\u2019s recruitment and Mr. Epstein\u2019s alleged abuse. Jane Doe\u2019s family was in \u201cserious financial straits,\u201d the lawsuit alleges, and another teenage girl said she could make money by working for Mr. Epstein. The two girls went to Mr. Epstein\u2019s Manhattan townhouse, where Jane Doe was instructed to touch Mr. Epstein as he masturbated, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nOn subsequent visits, the lawsuit alleges, Mr. Epstein\u2019s assaults escalated, as he directed her to perform sexual acts while naked, including with other girls and an Epstein employee.\n\nThe lawsuit says she became financially dependent on Mr. Epstein, stopped attending school and spent almost all her time \u201cgratifying him sexually\u201d or recruiting other girls for him. The lawsuit also names Epstein employees who Jane Doe alleges facilitated Mr. Epstein\u2019s abuse.\n\nJane Doe has struggled with anxiety and depression since extricating herself from Mr. Epstein, at the age of 17, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Davis O\u2019Brien at Rebecca.OBrien@wsj.com", "description": "A woman at the center of sex-trafficking charges against Jeffrey Epstein filed a lawsuit against the late financier\u2019s estate, describing in graphic detail for the first time her alleged recruitment at age 14 to perform sex acts for him.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davis O Brien", "Rebecca.Obrien Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105944/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
