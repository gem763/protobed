It asks that constituent members \"make all reasonable endeavours to brief or select women barristers with relevant seniority and expertise, experience or interest in the relevant practice area\".\n\nWomen comprise almost 60 per cent of law students and 52 per cent of solicitors, but only 25 per cent of barristers.\n\nThe report suggests more work might need to be done on \"whether compliance with the policy has been achieved by providing women with a greater number of lower value briefs, or whether the policy is being affected by the phenomenon that, when the same work that men used to do begins to be done by women, that work is given a lower value\".\n\nIt also questions why the gender split was reversed when comparing recommendations and appearances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In 2017-18, female barristers received the majority of recommendations whether in current matters (63 per cent female to 37 per cent male) or in new matters (60-40), but still made the minority of appearances (39-61) as compared to male barristers,\" the report says.\n\n\"The same occurred in the 2016-2017 financial year. Female barristers were recommended more than male barristers in current matters (59-41) and in new matters (58-42), but appeared less often than male barristers (36-64) ...\"\n\n\"On one hypothesis, higher rates of recommendations for female barristers might signal a shift in discourse and attitude, which will, already or in the coming years, translate into work for female barristers.\n\n\"The opposing hypothesis is that higher rates of recommendations for female barristers are an example of \u2018soft change\u2019, signifying \u2018all talk and no action\u2019.\"\n\n'The legal profession is changing'\n\nThe chairwoman of the Law Council\u2019s Equal Opportunity Committee, Sydney barrister Kate Eastman SC, said the legal profession had the opportunity to lead by example on eliminating the gender pay gap.\n\n\u201cWe know the legal profession is changing \u2013 the majority of Australian law students and solicitors are women. So, if Australian bars want to remain relevant in the future, they also need to change.\"\n\nThe number of signatories to the policy doubled to 400 from 190 but the reporting rate was unchanged at about 42 per cent \u2013 another worrying trend for the report authors.\n\n\"Whether non-reporting adoptees should continue to benefit from the policy, which offers a positive public relations image but relies on the efforts of those adoptees who do report, is a question for review,\" the report says.\n\nThe total value of the fees reported by briefing entities was $510 million, well up on the $239 million in financial year 2017.", "description": "The peak body for lawyers fears that its equitable briefing policy might be a case of \"all talk and no action\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7b5fc37b34271d00a4764f57eafd4b81ddacfc24", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
