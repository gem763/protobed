This was never intended but a very lovely accident.\u2019\n\nThey even accidentally made the garden look like an owl (Picture: Tristan Potter / SWNS)\n\nOld pictures from the 1980s show just how much work the couple have done to transform their muddy lawn and broken rockery into the wondrous creation it is today.\n\nAs the garden has grown, it\u2019s even featured on several unofficial tourist trails in the Black Country and they estimate about 14,000 people from 48 different countries have come to visit it.\n\nMarie added: \u2018Some Chinese students came to visit our garden and told us that it was used as an example in one of their lectures.\n\nThe garden has colour all year round (Picture: Tristan Potter / SWNS)\n\n\u2018We spend around two hours a day in the garden but it can be more or less depending on the weather.\n\n\u2018There is always something to do or a flower or shrub to tend. It has become quite an obsession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We have grown some of the flowers ourselves from the seeds that have dropped from the other flowers.\u2019\n\nTony and Marie spend at least two hours a day in the garden (Picture: Tristan Potter / SWNS)\n\nRetired GP Tony added: \u2018First we made it child-friendly for our kids but as the years went by we moved on to planting and growing our own flowers and plants.\n\n\u2018There has been a lot of trial and error to get the garden way it is now.\n\n\u2018A lot of our plants are now 30 years old or more.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got a vast amount of colour and plants all year around. We try and add to the garden every year but at this time of year it is simply glorious.\u2019\n\nMORE: Why you should wear Wear It Pink this Friday and how it can help the fight for breast cancer survival\n\nMORE: Skin infection cellulitis makes baby look like she has a black eye\n\nMORE: Woman completes 10k obstacle race with hi-tech \u2018pirate leg\u2019 after breaking her ankle\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Marie and Tony Newton spent 37 years working on their garden and it now attracts visitors from all over the world.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/autumn-garden_1571308085.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
