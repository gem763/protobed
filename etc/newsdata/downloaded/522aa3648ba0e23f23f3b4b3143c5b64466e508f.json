To President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' US moves British ISIS suspects from Syria amid Turkish invasion MORE and his supporters, liberal media bias is an obvious fact. This bias, together with the media\u2019s incuriosity about Democratic wrongdoing versus their tenacious investigations of Republicans, drives conservatives nuts.\n\nThe fact that Donald Trump fearlessly and pugnaciously challenged media bias helped him secure the Republican nomination and continues to deepen the support he enjoys among his base. His supporters also sympathize with what he has had to endure since the day he was elected.\n\nI\u2019m 64 years old. I have never seen a new president face such resistance. Until Trump, new presidents generally received some measure of best wishes as they assumed an almost impossible task - a honeymoon, if only a brief one. Instead, the day after Trump\u2019s election, thousands of protestors took to the streets of Washington, New York, and other cities, calling for impeachment and burning him in effigy.\n\nFar more troubling, is the mounting evidence of a possible coordinated effort to sabotage Trump\u2019s administration. These efforts may have included the engineered appointment of a special counsel to investigate the false narrative of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Mainstream media\u2019s lack of curiosity about these, and other efforts, speaks volumes.\n\nI just want to know the truth.

Instead of holding show-trial hearings, we have opted to tenaciously gather facts and information \u2014 against significant resistance \u2014 to uncover that truth.\n\nThe information we have obtained only heightens my suspicions that there was corrupt behavior occurring within the Obama administration during the 2016 campaign and presidential transition.\n\nHere are some of the most obvious unanswered or inadequately answered questions raised during our more than four-year inquiry: (I have excluded questions that I hope to have answered in soon to be released DoJ-IG reports.)\n\n- Did President Obama see clintonemail.com (instead of an official government address) as Hillary Clinton\u2019s email address when he communicated with her?\n\n- Why didn\u2019t the FBI compel key witnesses to testify before the grand jury in its investigation of Clinton\u2019s email scandal?\n\n- Did the FBI require the preservation of evidence (computers and disk drives of Clinton and her associates)? If so, when? If not, why not?\n\n- Why was no one charged with a crime after Clinton\u2019s aides or employees used Bleachbit to permanently erase her emails and hammers to destroy two mobile devices?\n\n- Why did the FBI allow fact witnesses Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson to join Clinton\u2019s interview?\n\n- What contact and involvement occurred between Ukrainian officials and members of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and/or Obama administration regarding the 2016 election?\n\n- Did the Trump campaign receive a defensive briefing as thorough as was provided to Clinton\u2019s campaign and Sen.

How and why?\n\n- Who connected Australia\u2019s Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Alexander Downer, with George Papadopoulos in London? How and why?\n\n- Did Obama and/or members of his White House staff communicate with the Department of Justice, the FBI, or intelligence agencies regarding the investigation of Trump and his campaign?\n\n- Was there cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies during the investigation of the Trump campaign?\n\n- What was the role of CIA Director John Brennan John Owen BrennanFormer Reagan official rips Republicans for backing Trump: 'It's like the invasion of the body snatchers' Brennan: Republican senators 'running scared' of president because he 'comes after them with a vengeance' Ex-CIA chief Brennan: Trump whistleblower 'deserves our praise & gratitude' MORE and the intelligence community in that investigation?\n\n- How many Americans were \u201cunmasked\u201d during FISA surveillance? Which members of the Obama administration ordered unmasking, and why?\n\n- Why were high-level State Department officials meeting with Christopher Steele and funneling his dossier to the FBI?\n\n- What did Peter Strzok really mean by an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d?\n\n- In Peter Strzok\u2019s Dec. 15, 2016 text, what leaks by \u201cour sisters\u201d was he referring to, and what did he believe they were worried about?\n\n- Why was Peter Strzok - the FBI\u2019s lead investigator on the Trump/Russia probe - concerned \u201cthere\u2019s no big there there\u201d as he was considering joining the Special Counsel team?\n\nAs you can see, there is much we don\u2019t know, and many questions the mainstream media seems unwilling to ask and investigate.
