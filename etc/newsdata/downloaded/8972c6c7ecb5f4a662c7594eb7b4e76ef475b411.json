REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nSecond seed Federer, who received a first-round bye, broke Ramos-Vinolas twice in the opening set and sailed through his service games without facing a break point in the match.\n\nRamos-Vinolas, who upset Federer four years ago to snap a 15-match losing streak against top-10 players, recovered well to force a second-set tiebreak but his Swiss opponent came back from 4-1 down to seal victory.\n\n\u201cI focused, because when you travel around the globe, you\u2019re missing a bit of energy. Those first few games or matches can be sometimes a bit tricky,\u201d Federer said.\n\n\u201cServe was solid. I was hitting my spots and really was never in trouble there. But of course all of a sudden, being in a breaker, calls out for different play sometimes and different momentum.\n\n\u201cHe had his chances, but it was a nice comeback for me, and overall.\u201d\n\nFederer, a twice Shanghai champion, will next meet Belgium\u2019s David Goffin or Kazakh Mikhail Kukushkin for a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nFormer world number one Andy Murray showed some more positive signs in his injury comeback but eventually went down in a bruising battle with Italy\u2019s Fabio Fognini.\n\nMurray twice served for the match in the deciding set, but Fognini dug deep to force a tiebreak and secure a 7-6(4) 2-6 7-6(2) win in just over three hours.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of things that I need to get better at, and I can do much better,\u201d said Murray, who underwent a career-saving hip resurfacing procedure in January.\n\n\u201cI will go away and I\u2019ll work on those things and be in a better position next time I play against him.\u201d", "description": "Roger Federer eased past Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-2 7-6(5) to reach the last-16 of the Shanghai Masters on Tuesday, avenging a defeat to the Spaniard in their last meeting at the same stage of the tournament in 2015.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438749659&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980JF-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
