Watt Gets MRI, Confirms He Suffered Season-Ending Pec Injury vs. Raiders", "language": "en", "text": "Dylan Buell/Getty Images\n\nHouston Texans star J.J. Watt is getting an MRI after suffering an injury Sunday against the Oakland Raiders and will miss the remainder of the 2019 season.\n\nWatt revealed the news on Twitter after the 27-24 win: \"This game can be beautiful and it can also be brutal. Absolutely gutted that I won't be able to finish the season with my guys and give the fans what they deserve. I truly love this game and can't stand letting you guys down. Thank you for all of the thoughts & well-wishes.\"\n\nPreviously, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported the Texans feared Watt had suffered a torn pec.\n\nNobody questions how good Watt is when he's healthy. He finished with 61 combined tackles, 16 sacks and 18 tackles for loss in 2018 en route to his fifth Pro Bowl and fifth first-team All-Pro honor.\n\nHowever, injuries limited him to eight games between 2016 and 2017. He underwent season-ending back surgery in September 2016 and suffered a tibial plateau fracture in October 2017.\n\nWhile the problems weren't related, there was a question of whether they foreshadowed a general decline for Watt in the years ahead.\n\nHis performance upon his return seemingly put that doubt to bed for the time being.\n\nWatt is by far Houston's best defensive player. Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 33 player overall and No. 6 edge defender coming into the 2019 campaign.\n\nHe had three tackles for loss and four sacks through seven games entering Sunday.\n\nLed by Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins, the Texans have the framework for a dynamic offense\u2014albeit one that fell short of expectations in 2018. Since the defense will inevitably take a step backward without Watt, it will be up to the offense to shoulder the load the rest of the season.", "description": "Houston Texans  star  J.J.
