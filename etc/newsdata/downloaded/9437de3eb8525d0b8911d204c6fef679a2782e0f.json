Wednesday, however, was for Rosal\u00eda, Spain\u2019s greatest pop export since Julio Iglesias. For her, Mad Cool was a quick stop in the middle of a nine-month tour through Latin America, Europe and North America. But as she took the stage in white platform sneakers and an aqua top with an enormous ruffle running over her arms and chest, she gushed in Spanish, \u201cI am so, so, so thrilled to be here!\u201d\n\nGiant digital screens hung on either side of the stage, projecting her face to the crowd. Less visible was the garter-belt tattoo peeking out below her tiny, high-waisted shorts: a replica of the one that the Austrian feminist performance artist Valie Export gave herself onstage in 1970. Counterpointing sexiness with a kind of SoulCycle strength, Rosal\u00eda\u2019s troupe of female dancers wore white bike shorts and hoop earrings. They finished \u201cComo Ali\u201d \u2014 an unreleased tribute to Muhammad Ali \u2014 with a series of long, rapid-fire air punches, then held their hands overhead in fists.\n\nOn one side of the stage stood two male percussionists \u2014 experts in performing palmas, traditional flamenco hand claps. Palmas formed the backbone of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s next number, \u201cPienso en Tu Mir\u00e1\u201d (\u201cThinking of Your Gaze\u201d), a deceptively sweet-sounding tune about jealousy that mixes voices, palmas and electronic samples in a shifting 12/8, 10/8 beat pattern. The song, a Pitchfork critic wrote, \u201cstands out from virtually everything else on the global pop landscape.\u201d It appears on Rosal\u00eda\u2019s 2018 CD, \u201cEl Mal Querer\u201d (\u201cBad Love\u201d), a.k.a. \u201cE.M.Q.,\u201d which earned raves all over Europe and the United States as one of the best albums of last year. The album\u2019s first track, \u201cMalamente\u201d (\u201cBadly\u201d), streamed 15 million times in its first week in May 2018 and went platinum on the United States Latin charts earlier this year. \u201cMalamente\u201d also earned Rosal\u00eda two Latin Grammys and five total nominations, making her the most-nominated female artist in 2018. Last month, with the rest of \u201cE.M.Q.\u201d finally eligible, she repeated the feat, picking up five more Latin Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year. (This year\u2019s winners will be announced next month.)\n\n\u201cE.M.Q.\u201d transformed Rosal\u00eda\u2019s life, turning her into a sought-after collaborator who has recorded songs with James Blake, A. Chal, Ozuna and Pharrell Williams. In March, she posted \u201cCon Altura\u201d (\u201cHigh Class\u201d), a reggaeton collaboration with J. Balvin, on YouTube. It now has more than 951 million views, crushing Billie Ellish\u2019s \u201cBad Guy\u201d (567 million views), Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cthank u, next\u201d (432 million) and Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d (145 million). When \u201cCon Altura\u201d took the MTV Video Music Award for Best Latin in August, J. Balvin bowed toward Rosal\u00eda several times onstage, a gentleman\u2019s acknowledgment of her role in composing the hit. \u201cI think she\u2019s the only artist who can be compared to Beyonc\u00e9 in the Latin world,\u201d Juanes, the Colombian rock star who has won two Grammys and 23 Latin Grammys, told me. This month she appears in the opening scene of Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s new film \u201cDolor y Gloria\u201d (\u201cPain and Glory\u201d), cast opposite Pen\u00e9lope Cruz.\n\nSuccess like this inevitably provokes backlash. In Spain, rumors suggest that Rosal\u00eda is a fake created by industry professionals to satisfy market trends. Spanish Romani Gypsies have attacked her for using words of cal\u00f3 (Romani dialect) in her lyrics and for adopting Andalusian pronunciations and street styles in her videos. Catalan nationalists have complained that she should be using her platform to win support for their independence movement. In the United States, she has been accused of \u201cLatinx appropriation\u201d by critics on Twitter who argue that as a European country, Spain should be excluded from winning Best Latin awards. But if you love music, Rosal\u00eda\u2019s groundbreaking compositions and otherworldly voice are themselves the best answers to these sociocultural darts. Before she started topping YouTube and Spotify ranks, Rosal\u00eda spent more than a decade training in flamenco, one of the world\u2019s oldest, most heartfelt and most complex musical art forms. It is as if a rising mezzo-soprano decided to leave opera and bring coloratura to R&B.\n\nChristopher Anderson/Magnum, for The New York Times\n\n\u201cA song with a cappella or without a cappella?\u201d Rosal\u00eda asked the crowd at Mad Cool.\n\n\u201cA cappella!\u201d the field shouted\n\n\u201cI need lots, lots, lots, lots of silence, O.K.?\u201d\n\nThe field hushed. Everyone onstage went silent. As Rosal\u00eda poured out the flamenco classic \u201cCatalina,\u201d people wiped away tears. Her voice is both raw and liquid, vaulting smoothly from aching tenderness to angry longing. When she performs pure flamenco, Rosal\u00eda often sounds as if she\u2019s pulling her heart out through her mouth. Duende \u2014 the ability to transmit deep, authentic emotion \u2014 is a moment of nearly mystical self-effacement in flamenco, akin to an actor\u2019s disappearance inside a role. Its emotional vulnerability cannot be faked. Whenever she performs, Rosal\u00eda told me, she always tries to find that moment when \u201cyou\u2019re not there as an artist, not there as a person with your first and last name,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing more than a channel\u201d for the song\u2019s \u201csoul\u201d to pass through to an audience. \u201cYou\u2019re there more than ever, and super awake, but at the same time you\u2019re gone.\u201d She smiled with embarrassment, as if she were sharing a secret.\n\nTwo Spaniards, a Canadian, a Colombian and a clip from a Dominican television show came together to make \u201cCon Altura,\u201d an unlikely tribute to reggaeton, and one of the hottest international songs of the summer. By Joe Coscarelli, Alexandra Eaton, Alicia DeSantis, Antonio de Luca, Will Lloyd and Eden Weingart\n\nThe day after her Mad Cool performance, I found Rosal\u00eda Vila Tobella lounging on a red velvet love seat in her hotel suite, wearing no makeup, her hair twisted into a messy topknot. At 26, she could pass for 19, and much of her style these days seems like an attempt to balance her genetic predisposition to look adorable with expressions of her ferocious drive. The print on her romper was psychedelic flames. She gestured with nails that were long and sharp, polished pink and ornamented with tiny doughnuts, avocados, caramels and kittens.\n\n\u201cI started from zero,\u201d she told me in Spanish. \u201cNobody in my family is connected to the industry. Not a single contact in the music industry or in the entertainment industry.\u201d Rosal\u00eda didn\u2019t want to talk much about her family, whose privacy she says she tries to protect. But she, her parents and her younger sister, Pilar, are close. Her mother, who was an executive at a local company, quit to become Rosal\u00eda\u2019s business manager. Pilar, who studied art history, often works as Rosal\u00eda\u2019s stylist and creative consultant. Touring for \u201cE.M.Q.,\u201d Rosal\u00eda has traveled with them both.\n\nThe industry that, indirectly, made Rosal\u00eda\u2019s career was car manufacturing. In 1989, S.E.A.T., Spain\u2019s largest auto company, opened a facility on the outskirts of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s hometown, Sant Esteve Sesrovires, in Catalonia, in northeast Spain. S.E.A.T.\u2019s move turned a sleepy collection of red-tiled roofs and tree-lined streets \u2014 best known as the place where Chupa Chups lollipops were invented \u2014 into an industrial hub. Corporations sowed factories and warehouses in the rolling hills surrounding her town, and this crop lured workers from all over Spain. In 30 years, the town\u2019s population quadrupled, to 7,800. Many of these workers came from Andalusia, a region in southern Spain, and many of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s friends were their children. At her house, the stereo played Bob Marley, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Queen, but her friends listened to flamenco.\n\nThe origins of flamenco are not entirely known. The music emerged in Andalusia, which has hosted Arab, Jewish, Romani and Christian cultures for at least 600 years, and the Romani have always been associated with its performance, though flamenco\u2019s guitar style owes much to Catalonia. One day when Rosal\u00eda was 13, she was hanging with her friends in a park with some souped-up cars \u2014 doors open, songs blasting into the trees \u2014 when someone put on Camar\u00f3n de la Isla, one of the greatest flamenco singers of all time. Listening to him, she told the newspaper El Mundo, \u201cmy head exploded.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of that blast, Rosal\u00eda fixated on learning to sing flamenco. Traditionally, cantaoras absorb flamenco\u2019s complexities through their families, in the same way that other children learn language. For Rosal\u00eda, that wasn\u2019t an option. So she took flamenco dance classes and inhaled records by Camar\u00f3n, who cut several well-regarded albums in the 1970s with the guitarist Paco de Luc\u00eda. These albums are pure flamenco: nothing more than singing, guitar and palmas. But in 1979 Camar\u00f3n broke with de Luc\u00eda to make \u201cLa Leyenda del Tiempo\u201d (\u201cThe Legend of Time\u201d), an album inspired by progressive rock that used an electric bass. In flamenco circles, it was a scandal, like Bob Dylan\u2019s going electric at the Newport Folk Festival. Some people in the press called Camar\u00f3n the \u201cGypsy Mick Jagger.\u201d Camar\u00f3n and de Luc\u00eda made up, recording some stunning albums in the 1980s, but the friction between pure flamenco and flamenco fusionists has never really disappeared. In Sant Esteve Sesrovires the winners were Camar\u00f3n\u2019s fusion offspring; Rosal\u00eda saturated herself with their music. And she sang wherever she could: at home, in the streets, at local flamenco performances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that I will be an artist,\u201d Rosal\u00eda declared in 2007 on the Barcelona talent contest \u201cT\u00fa S\u00ed Que Vales\u201d (roughly, \u201cYou\u2019re Worth It\u201d), when she was only 15. She took the stage in spike-heeled boots, tight jeans and a tank top. Playing an acoustic guitar, with a medallion of the Virgin Mary dangling from her neck, she sang \u201cComo en un Mar Eterno,\u201d a nasal ballad by the flamenco fusionist Hanna. The judges looked bored. One of them demanded that Rosal\u00eda display \u201csome character.\u201d In response, she belted out \u201cNo One,\u201d by Alicia Keys. That was enough to pass her on to the finals, where she bombed. \u201cRosal\u00eda, you were regularly off-key during the song,\u201d a judge pointed out. \u201cI can\u2019t do everything,\u201d she responded defensively. \u201cI\u2019m trying to perform, sing and dance.\u201d\n\nRosal\u00eda told me that she auditioned for \u201cT\u00fa S\u00ed Que Vales\u201d because it was the only way she saw to break into show business. Failure revised her ambitions. After that she wanted, above all, to become a great musician. She gave up dancing and got serious about learning piano. She started composing music, with melodies, harmonies, chords and lyrics, trying to teach herself song structure. \u201cI wanted to have absolute control over my music,\u201d she told me, \u201cfrom the chords and the voicings of the songs to the arrangements and the production.\u201d\n\nThere was just one problem: her voice. All those years of faking a cantaora\u2019s power without proper training had damaged her vocal cords. She could no longer project normally. Doctors recommended surgery. After that, she needed a year of vocal rehabilitation. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019m supposed to learn from this: What is it?\u201d Rosal\u00eda recalls thinking during rehab.\n\nRosal\u00eda believes that nothing happens by chance. \u201cI don\u2019t force things,\u201d she told me. \u201cI can have a wish, and then I let God lead me on the path, bringing me what I need \u2014 and always trying to be alert to receive it.\u201d As she recovered in silence, she learned to appreciate the discipline of vocal technique. And she realized that there was someone who could train her to become a cantaora. He taught at Barcelona\u2019s premier music school, La Escola Superior de M\u00fasica de Catalunya (ESMUC), which usually accepts only one university student a year to study flamenco singing. But it just so happened that when Rosal\u00eda needed him most, that professor, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vizcaya, was also taking students at another Barcelona music school, the Taller de M\u00fasics, where teenagers could enroll.\n\nThe day Rosal\u00eda first appeared before Vizcaya with a doctor\u2019s report in her hand, he ran through his standard series of questions. What do you like about flamenco? How much flamenco have you listened to? Does your family sing flamenco? What types of music do you sing now? Then he tested her. Sing me some flamenco. Sing me some jazz. Sing me some pop. In this way, Vizcaya assembles a \u201cdiagnostic profile\u201d of his students, so he can decide how he\u2019ll train them. He soon figured out that Rosal\u00eda was an absolute amateur: The only thing she knew about pure flamenco was Camar\u00f3n. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd he taught me everything, everything, everything.\u201d\n\nVizcaya, who performs under the name El Chiqui de la L\u00ednea and is called Chiqui by everyone, has gray hair, kind eyes and a serious, patient manner. He was born in 1951 in C\u00e1diz, the same part of Andalusia where Camar\u00f3n was born in 1950. His father sang flamenco at bars and parties; Chiqui himself began singing at flamenco clubs when he was 19. A brilliant cantaor, he signed a contract with Los Tarantos, one of Barcelona\u2019s oldest flamenco venues, in the 1970s. There, at the height of the tourist season, he sang four performances a day. After he accepted an offer to teach at ESMUC in 2002, he pioneered a way of translating flamenco\u2019s tradition of private mentorship to a university setting.\n\nWorking with Chiqui, Rosal\u00eda stretched the range of her voice, learning to project while maintaining its flexibility and clarity. \u201cI sang with fear after my operation,\u201d Rosal\u00eda said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to damage my cords again. And I had to sort of relearn to sing.\u201d With Chiqui, she also learned to improvise melismas, the singing of multiple notes over a single syllable of lyric text. The song \u201cNos Quedamos Solitos\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019re Left All Alone\u201d), which Rosal\u00eda recorded for her first album, shows how this works. The lyrics are just a few sentences, roughly: \u201cIt was 2 in the morning/my brother came to wake me/why don\u2019t you wake, little brother?/Our mother has died/and we\u2019re left all alone.\u201d Rosal\u00eda draws out these words over several minutes with melismas, making you feel the suspense of the events: the waking, the older brother\u2019s voice, the death, the abandonment. Melismas also transform her singing into an embroidered sob that makes you feel the children\u2019s sorrow. Almost every time I listen to it, it brings me to tears.\n\nMelismas are not notated on sheet music. To study them, cantaoras must train their ears. Chiqui taught Rosal\u00eda to dissect them note by note so she could replicate the recorded songs that he gave her to practice. \u201cYou have to learn what\u2019s happening, one by one, until you know how to execute,\u201d she said. That\u2019s part of the reason becoming a good cantaora takes years. Flamenco melodies can switch from the modern major scale, common in Western music, to the Phrygian scale, common in Arabic and Klezmer music, in a phrase. Rosal\u00eda couldn\u2019t read these shifts in the songs she studied. She needed to hear them.\n\nRosal\u00eda may have known nothing when Chiqui met her, but he told me that she had a \u201cperfect ear,\u201d a prodigious memory and an exceptional work ethic. Songs that would take an average student nearly a month to learn, she would master in a week. \u201cShe drives me crazy,\u201d Chiqui said. \u201cIn classes when she sang the things that I assigned her and she interpreted them\u201d \u2014 he reached forward and mimed pinching both her cheeks with pleasure \u2014 \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand how well she did it. She was tremendous.\u201d The admiration was mutual. When Chiqui stopped teaching at Taller de M\u00fasics, Rosal\u00eda applied to ESMUC so that she could follow him there. For a while, Chiqui told me, Rosal\u00eda considered recording a pure flamenco album in homage to one of her favorite cantaoras, Pastora Pav\u00f3n Cruz, a.k.a. La Ni\u00f1a de los Peines (the girl with the combs). In the end, however, she dropped that idea in favor of recording an experimental flamenco album with a guitarist who once performed in a punk-rock band. Rosal\u00eda didn\u2019t have just discipline, taste and ambition; like all great artists, she also had an appetite for risk.\n\n\u201cIn \u2018Los \u00c1ngeles\u2019 you can find traditional lyrics, traditional melodies from flamenco,\u201d Rosal\u00eda said, gesturing with her doughnut-avocado nails as she described her first album. What isn\u2019t traditional, she said, \u201cis the way in which it\u2019s performed, both in the singing and the guitar and above all in the production.\u201d The CD, which Rosal\u00eda released when she was 24, sprouted from her friendship with Ra\u00fcl Fernandez Mir\u00f3, a classically trained pianist 16 years her senior who performs under the name Ra\u00fcl Refree. In the 1990s, Refree ditched music school to form a punk band, then went on to become an important producer and musician in Barcelona. The first time they met, in 2015, they talked not only flamenco but also James Blake, Kanye West and Frank Ocean. After that, they met in his studio several times a month, sharing music in long listening sessions. \u201cIt was like a festival of eclecticism,\u201d Refree told me. She might play him a reggaeton video. He might respond with a clip of American folk. Then they might listen to some pure flamenco or some Glenn Gould. They never talked about recording together. But one day that fall, Rosal\u00eda began singing Bonnie \u201cPrince\u201d Billy\u2019s \u201cI See a Darkness.\u201d Refree, who had introduced her to the ballad, sat down at his piano to accompany her.\n\nA few weeks later, she suggested they perform a flamenco show at a bar in Barcelona in front of an audience of about 20 people. Though he had produced flamenco albums, Refree had never played flamenco live. But that night he improvised a flamenco-inspired response on guitar to Rosal\u00eda\u2019s melismas. For both, the set felt astonishing. \u201cWe could leap into the void and catch each other,\u201d Refree recalled. Rosal\u00eda said: \u201cFor me it was, like, cathartic. Every time I sang I connected very viscerally, you know?\u201d Walking together afterward, they decided that they had an obligation to make an album.\n\n\u201cI started from zero,\u201d Rosal\u00eda said. Christopher Anderson/Magnum, for The New York Times\n\nThe songs Rosal\u00eda picked for \u201cLos \u00c1ngeles\u201d dated mostly to the 1940s and 1950s, the era when La Ni\u00f1a de los Peines was at her height. Ever since the 1970s, flamenco aficionados have favored rough, husky afill\u00e1 voices, which many people associate with duende. But for this album, Rosal\u00eda and Refree both preferred la\u00edna voices: clean, high voices, ideal for executing elaborate vocal arabesques. This style suits Rosal\u00eda\u2019s own voice, and Chiqui, with his big data set of flamenco memories, spent years helping her explore it. Many of the recordings Rosal\u00eda took to Refree\u2019s studio were old and scratchy, time capsules from another age. Together they improvised new versions of each one. \u201cWhat we wanted was to find a personal reading of that song,\u201d Refree said.\n\nEven then Rosal\u00eda knew that she wanted to combine flamenco with electronic music. During the years she trained with Chiqui, she performed nonstop in and around Barcelona. She sang in so many tablaos, jazz bars and hip-hop jam sessions that she couldn\u2019t remember them all. She sang at weddings, private parties and restaurants. She performed in a film festival in Panama and an avant-garde theatrical production in Singapore. She appeared on two dance hall tracks by her friend C. Tangana and on hip-hop tracks by DJ Swet and C\u00e1lido Lehamo. She joined a baroque chorus at ESMUC. And, to earn a living, she sometimes recorded music for commercials. With Refree, she even tried out a few songs that she had composed but decided to kept them off \u201cLos \u00c1ngeles.\u201d\n\nShe deployed all this experience when she wrapped recording on \u201cLos \u00c1ngeles\u201d and began devising the senior thesis that eventually turned into \u201cEl Mal Querer.\u201d Her first thought was simply to find a way to draw melismas over danceable beats, so she could do more than sit in a chair, the way cantaoras traditionally perform. On the recommendation of a friend, she read \u201cFlamenca,\u201d an anonymous lyric poem from the 13th century that has nothing to do with flamenco. She threw out most of the poem\u2019s love-triangle plot and all of its aristocratic fawning. She kept its vision of a toxic marriage: a man whose insecurity leads him to lock up his wife. She blurred the gender-based roles and read up on the psychology of jealousy. She gave the songs she composed secondary titles like \u201cChapter 2: Wedding\u201d and \u201cChapter 4: Fight\u201d to suggest a narrative. Her lyrics read like a feminist version of \u201cCarmen,\u201d a bad romance told mostly from a female point of view. When \u201cLos \u00c1ngeles\u201d earned her a Latin Grammy nomination for Best New Artist in 2017, she had already performed early versions of \u201cEl Mal Querer\u201d at ESMUC.\n\nRolf B\u00e4cker, a musicologist and professor at ESMUC who has studied flamenco, told me a funny story about a Portuguese jazz expert who once decided to check out some flamenco in Seville. The expert came out of the tablao crying: He couldn\u2019t understand the rhythms. Each flamenco song style, or palo, is associated not only with a particular kind of melody and harmony but also with a specific metrical pattern. Many palos have shifting beat accents, known as amalgamated rhythms, which can sound like fused meters: a 3/4, for example, meshed with a 2/4. \u201cIt\u2019s super hard for someone who doesn\u2019t come from listening to amalgamated rhythms,\u201d Rosal\u00eda told me on the velvet love seat in her hotel.\n\nI asked her to show me how it was done.\n\nShe leaned forward on the couch, curving her body over her hands to teach me a fast palo called buler\u00eda. The moment she began striking her palms together, something flicked on: an intensity and also a playfulness. The beat was in her hands, her right foot, her shoulders, her throat. She clicked syncopations with her tongue and growled Mae West-like \u201cums\u201d on each beat. \u201cThink in like 6/8,\u201d she said, clapping quickly, \u201cand the buler\u00eda is here: One, two, three. Four, five, six.\u201d\n\nI tried to clap and count along, but soon messed up.\n\n\u201cThink in six claps.\u201d She got me clapping six fast monotonous beats. \u201cAnd now, we\u2019ll give it accent. One, two, three. Four, five, six.\u201d I fumbled along, like a toddler chasing after an adult. Later, when I practiced alone, I saw that the rhythm feels like a driving waltz, at once elegant and aggressive. But, really, Rosal\u00eda had taken pity on me. In many of her songs, the pattern is harder. \u201cPienso en Tu Mir\u00e1,\u201d for example, uses an amalgamated 12/8. It took her years, she said, to feel comfortable singing in this kind of rhythm. \u201cIt\u2019s not something immediate. It\u2019s something that each time you feel that the more that you know, the more you realize that you need to keep studying and learning, because there are details. The ones who know most are the older people. Grandparents are the ones who sing buler\u00eda best.\u201d\n\nPablo D\u00edaz-Reixa, known as El Guincho, knew nothing about amalgamated rhythms or Phrygian scales or melismas before he collaborated with Rosal\u00eda. An electronic musician and producer who once worked with Bj\u00f6rk, El Guincho disappeared from the music scene for three years to care for his mother, who eventually died of cancer. But in early 2016, he resurfaced with a dense, brilliant album called \u201cHiperAsia,\u201d which showcased his skill with sampling and vocal production. A few months after it appeared, Rosal\u00eda invited him to watch her perform a pure flamenco concert. By then, she already knew that she wanted \u201cE.M.Q.\u201d to be what she called a \u201cvoice-centric\u201d project that sampled different voices and played with vocal harmonies.\n\nShe later invited him to help her record a song for \u201cE.M.Q.,\u201d \u201cA Ning\u00fan Hombre.\u201d Their chemistry in the studio felt natural, Rosal\u00eda told me. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with other guys and the way Pablo is is very special, because Pablo really listens a lot,\u201d Rosal\u00eda said. \u201cHe embraces the fact that I make a lot of decisions.\u201d They spent the next year and half making \u201cE.M.Q.,\u201d meeting nearly every day to work at his place on laptops, a sound card, a microphone and a keyboard. If she taught him flamenco, El Guincho taught her about song structure and helped refine her lyrics. By the time they cut their final two songs \u2014 \u201cMalamente\u201d and \u201cPienso en Tu Mir\u00e1\u201d \u2014 they were working hand in hand on every aspect of the composition and production.\n\nTo my ears, \u201cE.M.Q.\u201d sounds like an album about escaping domestic abuse. There are sounds that suggest beating, weeping, knifing. When I mentioned this to Rosal\u00eda, she smiled: \u201cThat\u2019s an interpretation.\u201d She kept the lyrics ambiguous, so that different people could hear different plots as they listened to the songs. One of the hardest for her to write was \u201cDe Aqu\u00ed No Sales\u201d (\u201cYou\u2019re Not Getting Out of Here\u201d), which required her to find a way to speak truthfully from a place full of rage:\n\nWith the back of my hand\n\nI make it clear to you.\n\nI sell you bitter sorrows.\n\nCaramels I can also do.\n\nThese lines, even in translation, distill the seesaw of abuse. They also allude to the cantaor Macand\u00e9, a peddler whose melisma-filled sales cries for caramels were once a sensation in Cad\u00edz. In \u201cMalamente\u201d and elsewhere she inserted other Easter eggs, a few words of cal\u00f3 that would later enrage some Romani. Rosal\u00eda never intended to appropriate Gypsy culture, she told me. For her, the words were simply \u201ca wink honoring that flamenco tradition where cal\u00f3 is present and the Gypsy community has contributed so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not there as an artist, not there as a person with your first and last name,\u201d Rosal\u00eda said. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing more than a channel\u201d for the song\u2019s \u201csoul\u201d to pass through to an audience. Christopher Anderson/Magnum, for The New York Times\n\nRosal\u00eda loved working with El Guincho, but there were times while they made \u201cE.M.Q.\u201d that she felt nervous, even anguished. She was in debt, taking on serious artistic and financial risks. What if her experiments mixing flamenco with urban music didn\u2019t pay off? What if nobody would bet on her? She wasn\u2019t signed with a record label. Independence let her make \u201cE.M.Q.\u201d exactly how she wanted. It also meant she had no guarantee that her music would ever see proper distribution. Then she met Juanes.\n\nIn September 2017, the Colombian superstar Juanes saw Rosal\u00eda sing pure flamenco at a theater in Madrid. Looking every inch the cantaora, she appeared before an audience of about 100 people wearing a long velvet dress and sitting in a chair next to the Romani guitarist Joselito Acedo. \u201cAnd this woman started singing,\u201d Juanes told me. \u201cI wanted to die. I mean, I had never felt something so strong with someone singing in front of me like what I felt that day, and on top of everything else she was such a young woman, you know? For me it was like seeing Carlos Gardel or Edith Piaf or someone like that sing.\u201d\n\nThe first thing Juanes did after leaving the theater was call his business partner, Rebeca Le\u00f3n, a former vice president of Latin talent at AEG Live/Goldenvoice. \u201cRebeca,\u201d he says he told her, \u201cplease, you have to take a train to Barcelona. You have to talk with Rosal\u00eda. You have to talk with this girl.\u201d Earlier that year, Juanes and Le\u00f3n had started the Latin entertainment company Lionfish. The company\u2019s strategy, Le\u00f3n told Vanity Fair Espa\u00f1a last year, is to find artists who \u201care bilingual, bicultural and who can easily turn into global phenomena.\u201d Their clients have included the Colombian music producer Sky Rompiendo, the Dominican-American trap artist Fuego and the Colombian reggaeton superstar J. Balvin. In Barcelona, Le\u00f3n found Rosal\u00eda finishing \u201cEl Mal Querer.\u201d In January 2018, Le\u00f3n joined Rosal\u00eda\u2019s team as the artist\u2019s manager.\n\nBut even Le\u00f3n had trouble finding a home for \u201cE.M.Q.\u201d \u201cIn the beginning many people didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Le\u00f3n told Variety. \u201cThey said it was too left of center, you\u2019re gonna have to spend too much money, it\u2019s never gonna work.\u201d In cases like these, YouTube videos have become a lifeline for Spanish-speaking artists. A decade ago, they needed to sing in English to win corporate support and penetrate international markets. \u201cWhat YouTube has done is opened up both genres and different-language music,\u201d Vivien Lewit, YouTube\u2019s global head of artist relations told me. \u201cThe music itself is connecting with the audience, and the language itself seems to be in a place where it\u2019s almost secondary.\u201d Latin artists now make up more than 30 percent of YouTube\u2019s billion-views club, and so far this year, five of YouTube\u2019s Top 10 most-viewed artists are Latin: J. Balvin, Anuel AA, Ozuna, Bad Bunny and Daddy Yankee. Numbers like these can convince record-label executives that international artists are worth signing.\n\nFor the videos that she needed to make \u201cE.M.Q.\u201d feel accessible, Rosal\u00eda turned to her friends at Canada, a Barcelona company that shoots multinational advertisements and music videos. In their productions for \u201cMalamente\u201d and \u201cPienso en Tu Mir\u00e1,\u201d the director Nicol\u00e1s M\u00e9ndez stirred together Spanish icons and urban signifiers: olives and big-rig trucks, bullfighters and track pants. In one shot, a hooded Catholic penitent on a skateboard does an ollie in front of a huge cross. Setting Rosal\u00eda\u2019s music in industrial parks like the ones surrounding her hometown, M\u00e9ndez revealed its potential to express a new vision of Spanish identity, one that is profoundly traditional and yet urban.\n\n\u201cMalamente\u201d now has more than 107 million views on YouTube. \u201cPienso en Tu Mir\u00e1\u201d has crossed 50 million. Weeks after they went live, Rosal\u00eda signed a contract with Sony Spain. Suddenly \u201cE.M.Q.,\u201d an album made by two friends holed up in an apartment, didn\u2019t look so left of center, and Rosal\u00eda had secured the backing she needed to promote it all over the world.\n\nThis summer, at the MTV music awards, Rosal\u00eda took the stage in a crystal-trimmed bustier and black platform boots and performed the closest thing that she has written to a straight love song: \u201cYo x Ti, Tu x M\u00ed\u201d (\u201cMe x You, You x Me\u201d), a collaboration with El Guincho and the Puerto Rican trap and reggaeton sensation Ozuna. Rosal\u00eda sang it onstage shortly after Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes did their love song \u201cSe\u00f1orita.\u201d The contrast was impressive. There was Cabello in heels and a transparent dress rubbing against Mendes like a cat. And then there was Rosal\u00eda mixing flamenco gestures with modern and African dance and hip-hop. Onstage, she was fierce: Ozuna\u2019s equal, not his pet.\n\nDancing was the first thing that Rosal\u00eda gave up when she decided to become a serious musician. And it was the last element she needed to transform herself into a global pop sensation. She could have simply twerked and stripped, turning herself into a moving centerfold as so many female artists do. Instead she messaged Charm La\u2019Donna, the choreographer behind Kendrick Lamar\u2019s dramatic and militaristic Grammy performance in 2018. Rosal\u00eda didn\u2019t want her dances to suggest submission. \u201cThere\u2019s always an intention to show the figure of the woman with strength and power,\u201d she said. With La\u2019Donna, who has choreographed most of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s videos and live performances, she hatched a dance style that blended flamenco\u2019s sinuous gestures with hip-hop\u2019s punch.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to know how Rosal\u00eda\u2019s career will evolve. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a relationship, there\u2019s all kinds of moments,\u201d she said, imagining her future as a musician. \u201cThe beginning tends to be one way, the middle tends to be another and the ending tends to be another.\u201d She smiled. \u201cSo I know I\u2019m going to pass through all that. I know that I will age making music, and I want to see how my music changes with the years.\u201d What she wants most is \u201cnever to lose the desire to keep making music.\u201d\n\nLast February, standing onstage in a floor-length red dress at the Goya Awards, Spain\u2019s version of the Oscars, Rosal\u00eda sang, in Spanish, \u201cMe Quedo Contigo\u201d (\u201cI Stay With You\u201d), by Los Chunguitos:\n\nIf you make me choose\n\nBetween you and glory\n\nSo that history speaks of me\n\nFor centuries, oh, love ...\n\nI stay with you.\n\nIn her arrangement, Rosal\u00eda replaced the electric guitar and the drums with backup singing by the youth chorus Cor Jove de l\u2019Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0. The change brought forward the song\u2019s subtext, making it a declaration not just of romantic love but also of spiritual devotion. Her voice danced between strength and vulnerability, the knowing sneers and smiles of her pop performances were wiped from her face. In the final bars, her eyes glistened; her lower lip trembled. It was beauty. It was innovation. It was duende. Could it also have been a song about a life devoted to music? \u201cYou still haven\u2019t seen everything that Rosal\u00eda can do singing pure flamenco,\u201d Chiqui told me. \u201cEverything that she is, everything that she has inside, it still hasn\u2019t been seen.\u201d", "description": "Before her videos were racking up millions of views on YouTube, the artist spent more than a decade training in one of the world\u2019s oldest and most complex musical art forms.", "authors": ["Marcela Valdes"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/magazine/13-mag-Rosalia-picx-03/13-mag-Rosalia-picx-03-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
