President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un have toned down hostile rhetoric since they first shook hands in Singapore in June 2018. They were cordial even after their second summit broke down in Hanoi in February, and took an historic stroll together into North Korea four months later. All the while, Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program quietly advanced as U.S.-backed sanctions choked its moribund economy. The two countries can\u2019t agree on what the denuclearization of North Korea means and what rewards should be given, if any, in response to Pyongyang\u2019s moves toward disarmament. But Trump has invited Kim to the White House, while a top aide to Kim has touted the \u201cmysteriously wonderful\u201d chemistry between the two leaders.\n\n1. What have they agreed to?\n\nThe first summit resulted in a bare-bones declaration that contained four main items: To normalize ties between the U.S. and North Korea, formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, repatriate U.S. war remains and -- crucially -- \u201cto work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d But \u201cwork toward\u201d is undefined. It\u2019s also unclear whether the U.S. nuclear umbrella over South Korea is included. U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo says that Kim accepted the \u201cfinal, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea.\u201d North Korea points out the agreement referred to the entire peninsula and insists U.S. weapons must go at the same time, or it would be left vulnerable to attack. A meeting between Kim and Trump within the Demilitarized Zone in June 2019 led to an agreement to resume working-level talks to work on details. The two sides met in Sweden on Oct. 5 but disagreed about how it went.\n\n2. What does the U.S. want?\n\nTo start, the U.S. wants North Korea to provide an inventory of weapons, facilities and fissile material it has produced. Kim\u2019s regime calls that akin to asking for a \u201ctarget list.\u201d Further steps would include inspections, closing facilities and destroying weapons, and even surrendering nuclear material, according to proliferation experts. Past talks have faltered on the question of inspections and verification.\n\n3. What does North Korea want?\n\nKim wants \u201ccorresponding measures,\u201d or immediate rewards, for any steps his regime makes. In a televised New Year\u2019s address, Kim threatened to take a \u201cnew path\u201d if Washington didn\u2019t relax crippling economic sanctions. He signaled that any deal might require weakening the U.S.-South Korean alliance, urging Seoul not to resume military exercises with the American side. And he made clear that he believed the denuclearization pledge includes \u201cstrategic assets\u201d such as America\u2019s nuclear-capable planes and warships. But his language was less bellicose than past years, possibly reflecting his limited options.\n\n4. What has North Korea offered?\n\nIn Hanoi, North Korea offered to shut down parts of its Yongbyon nuclear complex, which has served as the crown jewel of its atomic program, in return for sanctions relief. The aging facility about 60 miles north of Pyongyang was once the main source of its fissile material, turning out roughly enough plutonium each year for one atomic bomb. But North Korea has since turned to uranium enrichment for weapons. Still, Yongbyon remains its main atomic research facility and a complete closure would affect its nuclear program.\n\n5. How did the Hanoi summit end?\n\nAbruptly. Trump said he walked out after Kim insisted that sanctions be completely lifted. North Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho disputed Trump\u2019s claim, saying that North Korea only asked that UN sanctions imposed during 2016 and 2017 be lifted. He also said Kim had pledged not to restart missile testing. The two sides, which do not have diplomatic relations, have also floated a deal to end the 1950-53 Korean War and talked about setting up liaison offices in the other\u2019s capital.\n\n6. So has there been any progress?\n\nSmall steps. In July 2018, North Korea released some 55 sets of remains of U.S. troops killed in the Korean War, but negotiations slowed over the remains of thousands of others. While Kim followed through on pledges to refrain from nuclear weapons tests and dismantle testing facilities, those were moves he had committed to before meeting Trump, having declared the testing phase complete. On the U.S. side, Trump suspended or scaled back military drills with South Korea, calling them expensive \u201cwar games.\u201d In doing so, he overruled then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. But the Trump administration also imposed extra sanctions on some North Koreans. Relations between North and South Korea improved somewhat, with a deal in September 2018 for removing land mines and some guard posts from the border zone. But Trump rejected as premature a proposal from South Korean President Moon Jae-in for confidence-building economic projects with North Korea. In June 2019, Trump praised a \u201cbeautiful\u201d letter from Kim and asked via Twitter for a meeting when Trump would be in South Korea. Trump and Kim met in the DMZ, shook hands with him at the border and joined him in a brief walk north across the line to become the first sitting U.S. president to step foot in North Korean territory.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Three meetings between the leaders of the U.S. and North Korea resulted in no concrete plans to end Pyongyang\u2019s atomic ambitions.
