Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s Perry Bacon Jr. posed a question this week that might have chilled the bones of progressives while thrilling centrists. It\u2019s one that is asked of presidential candidates from both parties if an approaching general election is perceived as highly competitive, as 2020\u2019s is expected to be:\n\nSeveral of Joe Biden\u2019s top rivals in the 2020 Democratic primary are presenting themselves as more liberal on policy issues than the former vice-president. But if Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or Kamala Harris were to win the nomination, would they reposition themselves to appeal to more centrist voters in a general election?\n\nIt\u2019s a question that in the not-too-distant past would have been answered affirmatively by most Democrats and some Republicans (the latter being more circumspect about arousing the suspicions of conservative ideologues forever trying to identify and purge RINOs, or Republicans In Name Only). No one would be as blatant as 2012 Mitt Romney communications director Eric Fehrnstrom:\n\n[W]hen Mr. Fehrnstrom on Wednesday reached for a word to describe how Mr. Romney might pivot to the general election, the one that came tumbling from his mouth was \u201cEtch A Sketch,\u201d the children\u2019s drawing toy in which nothing is ever permanent.\n\n\u201cEverything changes,\u201d Mr. Fehrnstrom, 50, said on CNN, with a slight smirk that suggested he believed he was about to use a clever line. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.\u201d\n\nConservatives who thought most of their policy positions came down from the Founders, if not from God Almighty, were not amused, and it exacerbated Romney\u2019s reputation for being an unprincipled opportunist. And it\u2019s the sort of thing Democratic progressives might fear in an ideologically anodyne candidate like Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg. In their struggle to challenge Elizabeth Warren\u2019s progressive credentials, you can imagine Bernie Sanders supporters fanning fears that the Massachusetts senator might \u201cmove to the center\u201d if nominated. She is, after all, a Democrat, not a Democratic Socialist, the self-identification that pretty much precludes any \u201cmove to the center\u201d by Bernie if it involves changing policy positions (many of which he\u2019s had for decades).\n\nBut as Bacon observes, a nomination winner\u2019s efforts to expand her base of support heading into a general election can be accomplished in ways other than changing policy positions or adopting new ones designed to appeal to \u201ccentrists\u201d or \u201cswing voters.\u201d\n\n[L]ike with past nominees, it will be easier for these candidates to present themselves as more moderate in a general election through shifts in tone and their vice-presidential picks rather than moving right on policy.\n\nThey can also, I would add, emphasize a different mix of the positions, or biographical features, that they already possess to appeal to voters who aren\u2019t in the party\u2019s \u201cbase.\u201d And that sometimes means forgetting about the increasingly dubious idea that swing voters are \u201ccentrist.\u201d If you think about it for a minute, a party nominee might best emphasize his most popular policy ideas, which may be \u201ccentrist\u201d but could just as easily be \u201cprogressive\u201d by conventional terms; examples of the latter include free college, expanded Social Security benefits, wealth taxes, and nationalist trade policies. Indeed, a smart general-election strategy for a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren might be to choose policies and messages that rev up progressives but at the same time appeal to swing voters. Those do exist.\n\nThe base-energizing factor speaks to another issue of general-election strategy: Campaigns must calculate to what extent their winning strategy depends on mobilization as opposed to persuasion. A lot of progressives believe non-voters skew heavily in their direction, on the theory that under-voting demographic groups like millennials are disproportionately progressive, and/or haven\u2019t viewed the two-party choice as sufficiently clear. So creating an ideologically polarized general-election atmosphere will boost turnout among both the partisan base and previous non-voters, without any \u201cmoving to the center\u201d at all.\n\nNow something Democrats may have to contend with is the very high probability that the Trump 2020 campaign and the GOP will campaign against the nominee as an infanticide-supporting, anti-American, business-hating socialist, forcing Democrats into the false choice of either implicitly confirming those characterizations or pushing off them in a way that may discourage the Democratic base. A GOP campaign of insane negativity and unprincipled smears would be the perfectly predictable Trump M.O., and it also could work, as Hillary Clinton\u2019s overconfident 2016 campaign learned.\n\nHow different candidates plan to deal with that challenge is a legitimate issue for primary voters, along with their plans to deal with a still-powerful Republican Party if they win. Everything we know about Sanders and his supporters suggests that he intends to overwhelm Trump by mobilizing a hidden majority that\u2019s been waiting to support a progressive \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d all along. Warren and other left-bent candidates may be more strategically flexible. And Biden, of course, has hitched his wagon to the older idea of \u201cmoving to the center\u201d as a way to persuade swing voters. Even if you think (as I do) that this is an outmoded way of thinking that sacrifices too much ideological turf, if a majority of Democratic primary voters think that way, it could lift the former veep to the nomination, if not the presidency.", "description": "Democratic moderates hope, and progressives fear, that their presidential candidate will \u201cmove to the center.\u201d for November. While swing voters may no longer be \u201ccentrist,\u201d Democrats must choose a general-election strategy, not just a nominee.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/01/01-warren-sanders.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
