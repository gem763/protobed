Their homes have been burned, and their families have been torn apart. . . . This is a matter of American honor and promise. So too, is the principle that we stand by our allies, that we do not abandon our friends. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred duties. It strikes at American honor.\u201d\n\nRomney went on to voice concerns over how Trump\u2019s initial decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has negatively impacted America\u2019s influence in the region.\n\n\u201cIranian and Russian interests in the Middle East have been advanced by our decision. At a time when we are applying maximum pressure on Iran, by giving them a stronger hand in Syria, we\u2019ve actually weakened that pressure. Russia\u2019s objective to play a greater role in the Middle East has also been greatly enhanced. The Kurds, out of desperation, have now aligned with Assad. So America is diminished, Russia, Iran, and Assad are strengthened,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Utah senator also reiterated his displeasure with being left out of the decision-making process, despite serving on the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee, and despite hosting a hearing with his subcommittee on the Syria situation only a few weeks ago.\n\nThe speech closed with Romney\u2019s dismissing arguments that the U.S. was right to have pulled out troops, and shouldn\u2019t have been in Syria in the first place.\n\n\u201cOnce you jump in the ocean to save a drowning soul, you don\u2019t turn around with the excuse that you didn\u2019t have to jump in in the first place. It is a matter of commitment,\u201d Romney said.\n\n\u201cAre we incapable of understanding and shaping complex situations? Russia seems to have figured it out. Are we less adept than they? And are our principles to be jettisoned when we find things get messy? . . . Assuming for the sake of understanding that \u2018getting out of endless wars\u2019 was the logic for the decision, why would we take action so precipitously? Why would we not warn our ally the Kurds of what we were about to do? Why would we not give them time to also withdraw, or give them time to dig in to defend themselves? Clearly the Turks had a heads up, because they were able to start bombing within mere hours. I simply don\u2019t understand why the administration did not explain in advance to Erdogan that it is unacceptable for Turkey to attack an American ally.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "A day after he called President Trump\u2019s handling of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria \u201cunacceptable,\u201d Senator Mitt Romney (R., Utah) gave a speech on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon demanding answers from the administration, and proposing that public hearings be held by the Senate to look into", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l2c63j8wXfvCbQJ8dFx50Q--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bade944a680d04feccdcb619bc260bb2", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
