Prisoners in China are often transferred with handcuffs and masks covering their faces.\n\nNathan Ruser, a researcher with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s international cyber policy centre, used clues in the footage, including landmarks and the position of the sun, to verify the video, which he believes was shot at a train station west of Korla in south-east Xinjiang in August last year.\n\nMuch of the focus of international criticism of China\u2019s far-reaching anti-terrorism campaign in Xinjiang has centred on the extra-judicial detentions of more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in internment and political re-education camps.\n\nThe number of formal arrests and prison sentences have also increased. According to analysis by the New York Times, local courts sentenced 230,000 people to prison or other punishments in 2017 and 2018, as the campaign got under way. Xinjiang accounts for less than 2% of the country\u2019s population but about 21% of all arrests in 2017.\n\nRuser said the detainees were most likely being transferred to prisons in Korla from Kashgar, where the crackdown has been particularly severe. The area is believed to be home to several re-education camps but fewer detention centres.\n\n\u201cIt counters the propaganda offensive China is trying to show,\u201d he said, underlining the treatment of those within the penal system.\n\nChina has been taking diplomats and select groups of journalists on carefully orchestrated tours of Xinjiang and has defended its anti-extremism methods, describing them as a model for other countries to follow.\n\nOn Sunday, Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, described the video as \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d.\n\nThe video was posted on YouTube by an account named War on Fear, whose stated goal is to fight fear inspired by hi-tech surveillance.", "description": "Video shows what appears to be Uighur or other minority prisoners led away by police", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d479de64d07807759f468bd9269206f976a9f9db/40_0_1198_719/master/1198.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4599d5860552f43c9e272a4aa91c9f8b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
