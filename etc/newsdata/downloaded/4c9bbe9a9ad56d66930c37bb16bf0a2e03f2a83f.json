France and Cyprus are conducting naval maneuvers there now.\n\nOver the years, Turkey has become increasingly less dependent on European nations for its defense needs and it was unclear what the impact of such a measure would be beyond applying diplomatic pain.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong commitment by all members of the council to take the actions required to stop selling arms to Turkey,\u201d Josep Borrell, the Spanish foreign minister who is slated to become EU foreign policy chief next month, told The Associated Press.\n\nRelations between the bloc and Turkey under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have steadily worsened over the years, especially after he likened some German moves to Nazi practices.\n\nAnd even though both sides agreed upon a deal in 2016 to stop migrants from traveling westward from Turkey to the European mainland, Erdogan is now wielding that like a cudgel. Since his operation in northern Syria began last week, he has sought to quell Europe criticism of it by warning that he could \u201copen the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way.\u201d\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said Monday that \u201cwe should not cave in to blackmail.\u201d\n\nDespite such abrasive relations, Turkey\u2019s links with most EU nations are cemented through the NATO alliance and its commitment to stand by each other\u2019s side in times of need. NATO\u2019s Article 5 says an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all.\n\nErdogan on Monday criticized his European allies, saying \u201cWe are a NATO ally.\n\nPlease note that these countries are all NATO countries.\u201d\n\nHe added \u201cWhose side should they be on, according to Article 5?\u201d\n\nStill, many think Turkey crossed more than just a physical border when it went into northern Syria last week to attack Syrian Kurdish strongholds \u2014 it also endangered the fight against Islamic State militants.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made that point Monday, telling NATO\u2019s Parliamentary Assembly in London that he expects \u201cTurkey to act with restraint and in coordination with other allies so that we can preserve the gains we have made against our common enemy:\u201d the Islamic State group.\n\n\u201cThese gains must not be jeopardized,\u201d Stoltenberg said.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the Turkish military operation had already displaced 130,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish offensive has the risk of bringing (Islamic State) to the fore again in different ways,\u201d Le Drian said. \u201cIt is especially grave since it will engender a real humanitarian disaster.\u201d\n\nLe Drian urged the United States to call for a meeting of the international coalition against the Islamic State group, given that the chaos caused by the Turkish offensive was reviving the threat of IS in Syria.\n\nSyria\u2019s Kurds, who Turkey is now going after, were key allies in a U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group.\n\nBorrell criticized U.S. President Trump\u2019s administration for allowing Turkey to invade Syria.\n\nIf \u201cAmerican troops would not have withdrawn (from Syria), the attack would have been impossible,\u201d Borrell said.\n\n___\n\nAngela Charlton contributed from Kyiv, Ukraine and Suzan Fraser from Ankara, Turkey.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "European Union nations vented outrage Monday at Turkey's military offensive in northern Syria against the Kurds and joined France and Germany in banning arms sales to Ankara, a rare move against a NATO ally for many of them.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Raf Casert"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/luxembourg_eu_turkey_syria_44070_c0-124-3512-2172_s1200x700.jpg?b4fb264368fa66985328145b1f0a68904e045fb8", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
