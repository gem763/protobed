(AP) - No. 14 Iowa and No. 19 Michigan have at least one thing in common, failing to finish first since the schools shared the Big Ten title in 2004.\n\nIowa is in its longest conference championship drought since going two-plus decades between the titles won by the Forest Evashevski-led team in 1960 and coach Hayden Fry\u2019s first of three conference championships in 1981.\n\nMichigan, meanwhile, is in its longest skid without a conference title in program history.\n\nThe Big Ten will not be won when the two teams meet Saturday at the Big House, but a loss certainly won\u2019t help their chances.\n\nHere are some things to watch when the Hawkeyes (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) and Wolverines (3-1, 1-1) meet in a possibly pivotal game:\n\nSTANLEY\u2019S TIME\n\nIowa\u2019s Nate Stanley might be one of the best quarterbacks under the radar. Stanley has yet to throw an interception in 2019, attempting 136 passes without getting picked off since last season. He has thrown eight touchdown passes this season and 60 in his career, putting him two touchdown passes shy of passing Drew Tate for second on Iowa\u2019s all-time list behind 1985 Heisman runner-up Chuck Long. Stanley, who is 21-9 as a starter for the Hawkeyes, is averaging 241 yards passing per a game.\n\nThe senior is looking forward to his first and only visit to the Big House.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a great environment, one of the historic venues in college football,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be a great opportunity to play in a special environment.\u201d\n\nLIMITING THE LOAD\n\nMichigan running back Zach Charbonnet has carried the ball a total of seven times since he was handed the ball 33 times in a double-overtime win over Army. The freshman standout is sharing time in the backfield with Christian Turner, Hassan Haskins and Tru Wilson.\n\nHarbaugh acknowledged he\u2019s trying to limit the number of times Charbonnet carries the ball, saying 33 times is too many in one game.\n\n\u201cOccasionally, that may occur,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cNot something I think you want to consistently do with running backs.\u201d\n\nFAMILIAR FOE\n\nOliver Martin was on Michigan\u2019s football team last spring, competing for playing time. The receiver transferred to Iowa in the summer to play for his hometown team. Martin was granted a waiver to play immediately, putting him on the field with former teammates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very weird,\u201d Wolverines cornerback Lavert Hill said.\n\nMartin has five receptions for 28 yards and a touchdown this season. As a redshirt freshman last year with the Wolverines, he had 11 catches for 125 yards and a touchdown.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\nAfter Michigan routed Rutgers 52-0 last week, linebacker Cam McGrone was asked about the team getting widely criticized about its 35-14 loss at Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really tired of it because, you know, it happened,\u201d McGrone said. \u201cBut we definitely embrace it because we know we\u2019re going to see them again in Indy, in my hometown for the Big Ten championship. So, I don\u2019t really mind hearing about it because I know when we see them again, we\u2019re gonna smack them in the mouth.\u201d\n\nON THE GROUND\n\nIowa\u2019s revamped rushing attack is averaging nearly 5.2 yards per carry and the team hasn\u2019t lost a fumble in three games. The Hawkeyes and Oregon State are the only teams in America that have only committed one turnover so far.\n\n\u201cPart of it\u2019s experience,\u201d coach Kirk Ferentz said. \u201cPart of it\u2019s concentration, too.\u201d\n\nIowa rotates running backs Mekhi Sargent and Tyler Goodson behind an offensive line with two seniors and two juniors. The Wolverines were pushed around two weeks ago at Wisconsin and allowed Jonathan Taylor to run for 203 yards and two touchdowns in a 35-14 win.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Luke Meredith contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No. 14 Iowa and No. 19 Michigan have at least one thing in common, failing to finish first since the schools shared the Big Ten title in 2004.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/middle_tennessee_iowa_football_90421_c0-186-4453-2782_s1770x1032.jpg?6dfe3bd20770f8bdf86f35e7e7c0b1c957fa3ee9", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
