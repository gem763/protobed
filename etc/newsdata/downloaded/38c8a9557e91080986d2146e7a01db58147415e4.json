The United States and several eastern European, Nordic and Baltic countries have expressed concern that the project, led by state-owned Gazprom (GAZP.MM), will increase Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian gas.\n\nA U.S. Energy Department official said the project increases Russia\u2019s grip over regional energy supply and threatens the security of European allies. \u201cThe United States will ... examine all tools at its disposal regarding this project,\u201d the official said on condition anonymity, though it was unclear whether tools such as sanctions could stop it.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, like his predecessor former President Barack Obama has opposed the project. The United States is offering exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Europe to lessen its dependence on Russian gas.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, speaking in Budapest, said it was in Europe\u2019s interests to finish the project.\n\n\u201cWe welcome this decision,\u201d Putin said at a news conference after meeting Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban. \u201cDenmark has proved itself as a responsible participant of the international communication, defending its interests and its sovereignty, (as well as) interests of its main partners in Europe that are interested in diversification of deliveries of Russian hydrocarbons.\n\nAccording to its initial schedule, Nord Stream 2 should have been operational by the end of this year when an agreement on the transit of Russian gas via Ukraine, the main route for exports to Europe, expires.\n\nThe EU has urged Moscow and Kiev to reach a new agreement before Dec. 31 but there are a number of obstacles including a political row between Kiev and Moscow, a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine, and litigation between Russian gas supplier Gazprom and Ukraine energy company Naftogaz.\n\nGermany has also said that Nord Stream 2 would only be launched if Gazprom also continued to transit gas through Ukraine.\n\nNO TIMELINE\n\nA spokesman said the Nord Stream 2 consortium, which includes Germany\u2019s Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall DEA, Anglo-Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Austria\u2019s OMV (OMVV.VI) and France\u2019s Engie (ENGIE.PA), would work to complete the project \u201cin the coming months,\u201d but declined to specify a timeline.\n\nMore than 87% of Nord Stream 2 has been built but applications with Danish authorities to lay pipes under Danish waters have been pending since April 2017.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to have obtained Denmark\u2019s consent to construct the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline through the Danish continental shelf area,\u201d said Samira Kiefer Andersson, Nord Stream 2\u2019s permitting manager in Denmark, in a statement.\n\nShe said that preparatory work and the subsequent pipelay would start in coming weeks, but it was not immediately clear how long it would take to complete the stretch.\n\nThe Danish Energy Agency said in a statement that it had granted a permit to Nord Stream 2 to construct a 147-km section of the twin pipeline southeast of the Danish island Bornholm in the Baltic Sea.\n\nNord Stream 2 will have to wait another month before the permit can be used, according to Danish law which gives parties the option to lodge complaints for up to four weeks after the decision, the DEA said.\n\nAt a joint news conference with Putin, Orban said Hungary was interested in joining the TurkStream gas pipeline, running from Turkey via Bulgaria to Serbia and Hungary, next year.\n\n\u201cTurkStream is a preference (for us); the sooner we can join the better,\u201d Orban said.\n\nTurkStream would open up an additional gas delivery route to Hungary, which is also reliant on Russian gas shipments via Ukraine.\n\nA U.S. bill to slap sanctions on companies involved in building the project passed a Senate committee in July but has yet to reach the full chamber.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Allseas' deep sea pipe laying ship Solitaire lays a pipe for Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Baltic Sea September 13, 2019.
