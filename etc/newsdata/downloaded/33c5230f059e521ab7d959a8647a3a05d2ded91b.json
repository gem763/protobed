Israel\u2019s GIF specialists seem to be a bit obsessed with Tehran.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one meaner than the mean girls of the Middle East,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces quipped from its Twitter account on Thursday, alongside a photo of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, President Hassan Rouhani and military commander General Qasem Soleimani, all three photoshopped into the Illinois high school portrayed in the movie \u2018Mean Girls\u2019.\n\nThere\u2019s no one meaner than the mean girls of the Middle East...#DontSitWithThem#MeanGirlsDaypic.twitter.com/4WFSCU9yb5 \u2014 Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) October 3, 2019\n\nThe tweet elicited a mix of laughs and groans. \u201cI think we should discuss our MoD budget,\u201d one Israeli sarcastically replied. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because Netanyahu is SUCH a Gretchen,\u201d another jeered.\n\nThough October 3 is being celebrated online as #MeanGirlsDay \u2013 a reference to a line in the 2004 comedy \u2013 the Israeli government has a peculiar fondness for using the movie to mock Iran. After Ayatollah Khamenei called the Jewish state a \u201ccancerous tumor\u201d to be \u201ceradicated\u201d last June, the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC shot back with a spicy GIF, asking Khamenei \u201cwhy are you so obsessed with me?\u201d\n\nOur stance against Israel is the same stance we have always taken. #Israel is a malignant cancerous tumor in the West Asian region that has to be removed and eradicated: it is possible and it will happen. 7/31/91#GreatReturnMarch \u2014 Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) June 3, 2018\n\nThe obsession with gif-based warfare, however, seems entirely one sided. To be fair, the Israeli military often jumps on board other pop culture trends too, with these efforts sometimes backfiring spectacularly.\n\nThe IDF celebrated the 25th anniversary of the sitcom \u2018Friends\u2019 last month with a video featuring a group of its soldiers recreating the show\u2019s iconic opening sequence, along with the title \u201cIDFriends.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018The One Where They Commit War Crimes\u2019: IDF tweet celebrating Friends sitcom's 25th anniversary backfires spectacularly\n\nThe tweet was panned on social media. \u201cLove the one where Chandler fires white phosphorus into a hospital,\u201d responded one user. \u201cThe one where Joey snipes a child,\u201d another tweeted. Even supporters of the IDF rolled their eyes, telling the force to stop clowning around and \u201cbe soldiers.\u201d\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "The Israeli military has fired off a \u2018Mean Girls\u2019-inspired insult at its Iranian enemies, the latest in a series of hit-or-miss social media misadventures.
