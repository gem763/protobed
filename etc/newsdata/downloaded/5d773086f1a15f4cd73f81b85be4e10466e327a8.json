It predicted a lower appetite for the metal for the full year 2019, versus its previous estimate of demand growth.\n\n\u201cThe change is driven by weakening macroeconomic conditions, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and contracting manufacturing activity, especially in the global automotive sector,\u201d Alcoa said.\n\nThe bodies and parts of newer automobiles, including parts of the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for decades, Ford Motor Co.\u2019s F, +0.00% F-150 pickup truck, are increasingly made of aluminum alloys rather than steel. And more manufacturers, driven by consumers\u2019 environmental concerns, are replacing plastic goods with aluminum.\n\nFor the alumina market, Alcoa projected a global surplus for 2019 that was slightly higher than the previous quarter\u2019s predictions, thanks to \u201cfaster restarts and expansions in the world ex-China\u201d as well as lower alumina demand due to disruptions at several aluminum smelters in China. The bauxite market was also expected to have a larger surplus this year, which Alcoa pinned on higher supply from Guinea partially offset by stronger demand from Chinese refineries.\n\nAlcoa reported a wider quarterly loss and revenues in line with Wall Street expectations, and the stock rose more than 6% in the extended session as the company said it launched a review of its smelting and refining capacities, including asset sales, with an eye toward lowering costs and boosting profits.\n\nAlcoa last month got a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which cited expectations of lower prices and fewer catalysts for the producer. The bigger picture for Alcoa was \u201cunchanged and fundamentally challenged\u201d by a slowing China, growing U.S. steel capacity and fears of global recession, Goldman\u2019s Matthew Korn wrote in a note.\n\nAlcoa shares have declined 28% this year, contrasting with gains of 19% for the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.20% and 16% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, -0.08% . The shares are down nearly 50% in the past 12 months, versus advances of 6.4% and 4.7% for the S&P and the Dow, respectively.", "description": "Alcoa Corp. stock rallied Wednesday after the industrial giant took action to shore up profits, but the quarterly update also predicted lower aluminum demand...", "authors": ["Claudia Assis"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
