Rodgers tossed a ball to the back right corner of the end zone in what looked like a throw-away. However, Packers running back Jamaal Williams came flying in, grabbed the ball, and got two feet down before falling out of bounds.\n\nEven NBC's Al Michael began to call it a throw-away before saying it surprised him that Williams caught it for the score.\n\nThe incredible play put the Packers up 24-17.\n\nWhile it initially looked like Williams saved a broken play, another angle appears to show Rodgers seeing Williams and tossing the ball up. Rodgers let go of the ball shortly after Williams raised his hands up in the end zone.\n\n\u2014NFL Matchup on ESPN (@NFLMatchup) October 28, 2019\n\nWhile referees reviewed the play to confirm the touchdown, the normally stoic Rodgers even looked impressed.\n\n\u2014Pick Six Podcast (@picksixpod) October 28, 2019\n\nPlayers on both sides were in disbelief after the game.\n\n\"I truly believe he was throwing it away,\" Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu said.\n\nPackers tight end Jimmy Graham said it was the type of throw makes Rodgers the \"GOAT.\"\n\n\"I saw the ball in the air and I was like, 'That's a little high,' and then I look back...\" Graham said after the game. \"I mean, that's just who he is. He's special. It's moments like that that make him the GOAT.\"\n\nWilliams said he and Rodgers made eye contact and he just went to the corner to go get the ball.\n\n\"When we met eyes, I just seen him throw it and then after that, I'm just like, 'Hmm, this ball looks like it's going in the corner. Might as well go and run after it,'\" Williams said.\n\nRodgers said he did mean to target Graham, but he felt it was a \"safe\" throw because nobody was in the back of the end zone.\n\n\"I was actually throwing a ball that I thought maybe Jimmy could go up and get if he wanted to and, if he didn't, the guy behind him might be able to get it. Luckily, the guy behind him got it,\" Rodgers said.\n\nRodgers downplayed the idea that he and Williams \"locked eyes\" on the play, but he said he did see Williams in the end zone.\n\n\"It seemed like there wasn't anybody in the back of the end zone, so I felt like it was a safe throw.\"\n\n\"That was one of the best, if not the best pass I've ever seen live, in person,\" Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said. \"That was incredible. I couldn't believe it.\"\n\nThe Packers eventually picked up the win, with running back Aaron Jones scoring on a 67-yard screen pass on the next possession. At 7-1, they lead the NFC North.", "description": "Both Packers and Chiefs players couldn't believe how Aaron Rodgers and Jamaal Williams connected on a touchdown pass in the back of the end zone.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db7100cdee01970e3603c43?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
