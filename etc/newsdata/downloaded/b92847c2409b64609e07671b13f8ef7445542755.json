House race boils down to Trump after two years of drama and fraud allegations", "language": "en", "text": "David Locklear and James Oxendine work on the same construction crew and both call rural Robeson County, N.C., home. They arrived together to cast early votes in next week\u2019s House special election.\n\nFrom there, the two diverged, and it had little to do with the candidates on the 9th Congressional District ballot.\n\nLocklear, 65, said his vote for Democrat Dan McCready was mainly about registering his opposition to President Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t like his attitude, period,\u201d he said.\n\nOxendine, 60, explained his vote for Republican Dan Bishop: \u201cTrump said to vote for him, and I like Trump.\u201d\n\nA political saga that has stretched over more than two years \u2014 exploding into allegations of ballot fraud that prompted state and federal investigations and the cancellation of November\u2019s general election \u2014 is set to end Tuesday with an election destined to serve as a referendum on Trump and a key barometer for the 2020 elections.\n\nFor Republicans, that would appear to be promising news in a district that preferred Trump by 12 percentage points in 2016. Bishop is showing no separation from the president, and his campaign\u2019s closing TV ad prominently features footage of Trump attacking McCready at a July rally as an \u201cultraliberal\u201d who \u201clikes open borders and \u201creally admires socialism.\u201d\n\n\n\nRepublican Dan Bishop answers a question during a news conference outside McCready's campaign headquarters in Charlotte. (Chuck Burton/AP)\n\nBishop \u201cwill indeed defend your values,\u201d Trump says, delivering his endorsement as the ad shows McCready alongside images of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic presidential candidate, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nYet the race between Bishop and McCready is remarkably tight, according to the candidates, political operatives and public polls. It has prompted an all-hands effort in both parties to turn out voters \u2014 culminating in planned visits Monday from Trump at one end of the district and Vice President Pence at the other.\n\nThe stakes for the race go beyond a single congressional seat. For one, it will measure whether the \u201cblue wave\u201d that swept House Democrats into the majority last year continues to roll and whether Republicans have been able to recover support in suburban precincts such as the subdivisions of south Charlotte and neighboring Union County where much of the district\u2019s votes are likely to be cast.\n\nIn Washington, GOP officials quietly fear that a Bishop loss could turn a steady stream of House retirements \u2014 16 so far \u2014 into a torrent that could make retaking the chamber next year a near-impossible task. Democrats, meanwhile, fear a decisive McCready loss could give Republicans momentum heading into 2020, stoke anxiety about the leftward lurch of the party\u2019s presidential candidates, and spark internal recriminations that could compound a summer shake-up in the party\u2019s House campaign arm.\n\nFor McCready, Tuesday\u2019s election is the culmination of a 27-month slog that initially appeared to end in a narrow Nov. 6 defeat before allegations of rampant absentee ballot fraud perpetrated by a contractor for his then-Republican opponent, Mark Harris, prompted the state elections board to call the new election.\n\nThroughout, the 36-year-old Marine Corps veteran turned solar-energy investor has stuck to a careful message of bipartisanship focused on health care and education, taking aim at \u201cspecial interests\u201d and \u201cbroken politics\u201d but not Trump directly. And he brushes off the last-ditch press from the White House, which has included presidential tweets and robocalls.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s bringing in everybody he can to bail him out,\u201d McCready said of Bishop in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep doing my thing . . . People are ready for leaders who are going to reach across the aisle and work on the real problems people are having.\u201d\n\nBishop, a 55-year-old state senator, said his campaign imperative is simple: Let the voters of the district know that he is with Trump, through thick or in thin.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would like to believe that there\u2019s an opportunity in today\u2019s Congress for somebody to go up as a moderate and somehow chart a different path. That\u2019s just not how it\u2019s working right now,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nAbsentee ballot scandal\n\nOne factor that is shaking up the race is the fraud scandal involving an operative in the rural eastern part of the district who directed an effort to illegally collect and, in many cases, fill out absentee ballots in favor of Harris.\n\nDelivering an otherwise anodyne speech at an upscale retirement community in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, McCready was at his most animated discussing the scandal, which mainly targeted the elderly and minorities.\n\n\u201cWe saw what we now know is the largest case of election fraud in modern-day American history,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd mark my words: This election on Sept. 10 is the people\u2019s chance to get justice.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a message Democrats have been gently pushing alongside health care and bipartisanship \u2014 particularly to African Americans and the Lumbee tribe of Native Americans, which includes tens of thousands of voters in the eastern reaches of the district.\n\nAntjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based consultant and senior Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee adviser, said that although the advertising has not mentioned the scandal, it has suffused the race.\n\n\u201cPeople are knocking doors and reminding people that they\u2019re having this election because their vote\u2019s been stolen, and it\u2019s more important to turn out this time,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\n\nThat appeared to be true even at a polling place in a well-to-do Charlotte neighborhood, where retired physician Don Russ, 71 \u2014 typically a Republican voter \u2014 cast a ballot for McCready.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not cheaters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t respect that.\u201d\n\nBut in Pembroke, the historic center of the Lumbees \u2014 some of whose ballots were reportedly targeted for fraud by Leslie McCrae Dowless, who is charged with perpetrating the scheme in neighboring Bladen County \u2014 multiple McCready voters said they were afraid the opposite would be true.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re wondering if it\u2019s even worth their time,\u201d Concetta Bullard, 31, said of her fellow Lumbees.\n\n[FBI investigators scrutinized N.C. political operative in May, but took no public action to stop alleged election fraud]\n\nMcCready and national Democrats have made a special effort to reach out to the Lumbee community, in part by backing their decades-long struggle for federal tribal recognition. But Lumbee voters \u2014 most of them culturally conservative and devoutly Christian \u2014 are split.\n\nDaniel Barnes, a 61-year-old retired state employee from nearby Shannon, lamented the leftward tack of the national Democratic Party and said he had recently registered as a political independent after spending most of his life as a Democrat.\n\n\u201cNo party is perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my wife and I personally don\u2019t like how Democrats went liberal on certain standards that we were raised and taught against, and No. 1 is abortion. . . . I just can\u2019t see being affiliated with that.\u201d\n\nNational political dynamic\n\nThe final weeks of the election have been marked by scads of TV ad spending by the campaigns as well as outside party-affiliated groups. McCready\u2019s campaign has spent nearly $5 million, while Bishop\u2019s is approaching $2 million. Outside GOP-aligned groups have added $6.8 million during the course of the special election, while Democratic groups have spent about $3.5 million, according to federal records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nRepublicans have taken aim at McCready\u2019s business record, suggesting that he prospered at taxpayers\u2019 expense by lobbying state officials for tax breaks. While the allegations are convoluted, Republicans are hoping their Trumpian tag\u00adline, \u201cDan McGreedy,\u201d sticks.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are highlighting Bishop\u2019s legislative record, which includes writing the nationally controversial 2016 bill, later repealed, that would have policed which bathrooms transgender people could use.\n\nDemocrats have accused Bishop of doing the bidding of health insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry. McCready has taken particular delight in noting that Bishop cast the sole vote against a bill allowing pharmacists to inform patients of lower-priced alternatives to drugs prescribed by their doctors.\n\nBut neither party is quite certain how much those targeted attacks are going to sway voters who seem more concerned about the national political dynamic.\n\n\u201cThe single biggest message that we have for Dan is that he\u2019s been endorsed by the president,\u201d said Michael Whatley, the North Carolina Republican Party chairman. \u201cDo you want the person who\u2019s with Pelosi or the person who\u2019s with Trump?\u201d\n\nRepublicans are speculating that moderate and conservative voters generally are being driven to vote for Bishop after seeing the leftward lurch of many of the Democratic presidential candidates, whether in supporting a single-payer health-care system or decriminalizing border crossings or offering public benefits to undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cThey are stunned by that, and they\u2019re a little frightened by it, and so I think that makes the environment different than it was last November,\u201d Bishop said.\n\nAsked about some of the more progressive notions gaining traction in the presidential race, McCready briefly laments the \u201cextremism that\u2019s there on both sides\u201d before turning things back to \u201cbringing people together\u201d and \u201cbroken partisan politics.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on a divisive issue such as gun control, he sticks closely to his centrist comfort zone. At the retirement home, a resident pressed McCready on whether the general public ought to have access to military-style assault rifles.\n\nThe candidate talked about his experience carrying an M16 in the Marine Corps before circling back to his well-calibrated position on guns: universal background checks.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t really answer my question,\u201d the woman protested. \u201cNo one needs one of those guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy view is,\u201d McCready said, \u201cwe have got to look at what we can actually get done.\u201d\n\nDemocratic turnout has outpaced Republican turnout so far, but GOP officials say there are more than enough voters to put Bishop over the top \u2014 provided they come to the polls.\n\nThat\u2019s where they are hoping Trump can help, by driving up Election Day turnout, particularly in the rural eastern portion of the district where Republicans run strongest. McCready said he is ready to counter any GOP spike with help from a \u201cvolunteer army\u201d that is prepared to knock on tens of thousands of doors in the final days of the race.\n\nThere is a second House special election to be settled in North Carolina next week, in the coastal 3rd Congressional District, but it is under less of a national microscope, with Republicans confident they will prevail in a district that Trump won by 24 points.\n\nIf past pre-election rallies are any guide, Trump will invite Bishop to address the raucous crowd in Fayetteville for a few moments before carrying on with his own remarks.\n\nBishop said he hasn\u2019t decided what he plans to say, but he knows the broad strokes: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty simple message,\u201d he said. \u201cI want them to know I\u2019m going to support the president, and I want them to know that success requires them to turn out and vote.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "The race between Republican Dan Bishop and Democrat Dan McCready has prompted an all-hands effort in both parties to turn out voters before ballots are counted Tuesday.", "authors": ["Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Mike Debonis Covers Congress", "With A Focus On The House", "For The Washington Post.
