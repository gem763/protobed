On a couple of occasions we come to a complete stop, otherwise the traffic is generally maintaining about the 130 km/h posted speed, or higher.\n\nAt 140 km/h, the FF's V12 is ticking along in seventh gear at 2500 rpm. There is plenty of power available instantly should it be needed, but in this sort of driving it is having a very easy time of it.\n\nAfter an hour or so, the road cuts through the green hills of the lower alps. That means spectacular bridges and viaducts, castles and cathedrals on rocky outcrops, and ancient villages tumbling down hills. It also means plenty of good corners and in the viaducts the 6.3-litre V12 sounds particularly wonderful.\n\nInterior gets vote\n\nYou don't hear many nominate the FF as the most attractive Ferrari \u2013 getting four decent sized seats into a coupe is no easy business \u2013 but I'd vote for the interior. The jet-like vents and rounded surfaces are classic, while this car's soft tan leather with highlighted cream stitching is just exquisite. Scores of individual pieces of leather have been stitched together to create a glove-like effect. The attention to detail goes right back into the cargo hold, with equally classy moulded leather panels.\n\nThe car is fitted with a passenger instrument panel, showing speed, revs, and gear choice, plus ventilated seats and other options that, if delivered in Australia, would lift the price well beyond the standard $625,000. The full glass roof, though, is now standard equipment.\n\nThe steering is so quick to react that when you are cruising on an expressway and suddenly find yourself at a tight corner you can forget you are in a super-sports machine and turn in too aggressively, requiring a correction and a silent apology to other road users for your jerky passage through the bend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother thing to apologise for: getting in the wrong door, with everyone watching, at a very busy roadside coffee stop. Let's not dwell on that. Let's just agree that the left side is a stupid place to put the steering wheel.\n\nThe Autostrada runs besides the Passo della Cisa, the old mountain road on which Enzo Ferrari won his first race, well before he founded the car company bearing his name. After the turn off to run along the coast, there is quarried marble stacked next to the Autostrada (nearby Carrara has been famous for it since ancient times)\n\nYou don't hear many nominate the FF as the most attractive Ferrari \u2013 getting four decent sized seats into a coupe is no easy business. Tony Davis\n\nAfter three hours the outside temp is 26 degrees. OK, this is summer. There are palm trees and the definite smell of sea air. We are at the Tuscan coast, a mini-Italian Riviera with narrow, hotel-lined streets, rows of lounges and umbrellas on private beaches, and big crowds.\n\nAs this story is primarily about the drive, let's fast forward to day two and the far more engaging return. This time it was briefly along the coast by Autostrada, then through Aulla and onwards through the narrow alpine passes, some of them not a great deal wider than the FF.\n\nA succession of beautiful little towns edge the so-called Passo Radici (otherwise known as SS63): Fivizzano, Busana, Castelnovo ne' Monti, Casina. The narrow roads run straight past the walls of houses arranged at various angles to the street, and sometimes protruding out into the street. Some residents would need to check the traffic before opening their front doors.\n\nThis route gives us classic European mountain roads \u2013 with no snow \u2013 and the snaking progress up and down mountains is exhilarating. There are hundreds and hundreds of corners, many of them requiring full steering lock, many providing nervous moments when faced with oncoming traffic. At times I'm scarcely averaging 60 km/h despite working the big, powerful car (and myself) hard.\n\nThere is almost nowhere to stop on these roads, unless you are prepared to balance the car on a precarious ridge or try to fit into one of the tight parking lots belonging to bars and restaurants. The angles of approach and departure, or the size of the actual spaces, almost never suits the FF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo it is about two-and-a-half hours before I can finally park with ease, order a coffee and local pastry and, staring across the road at the safely parked car, write this story while reflecting there are worse ways to spend a day.\n\nModel: Ferrari FF\n\nAustralian price (excluding on-road costs and options): $625,000\n\nEngine: 6.3-litre V12 (petrol)\n\nPower/torque: 468 kW/683 Nm\n\nFuel economy (combined cycle): 15.4 L/100 km\n\nC02: 360 grams per kilometre\n\nThe author drove this car in Europe in July while a guest of Ferrari.", "description": "This is Ferrari's only four-wheel drive model and only four-seater.
