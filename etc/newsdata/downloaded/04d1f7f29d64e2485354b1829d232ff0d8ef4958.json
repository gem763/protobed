(CTXS) third-quarter adjusted earnings beat analysts expectations.\n\nThe information technology solutions company reported third-quarter earnings were $271 million, or earning per share of $2.04.\n\nAdjusted EPS was $1.52, more than the company's guidance of $1.15 to $1.30 and beating FactSet consensus for $1.25.\n\nThe company said revenue was $733 million, which exceeded its guidance of $700 million to $720 million. Revenue was flat on year, the company said, as subscription revenue growth of 43% offset the decline of 23% in perpetual product and license revenue.\n\nShares were up 4% early, to $107.95.\n\nWrite to Michael Dabaie at michael.dabaie@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 10:06 ET (14:06 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
