If I knew the answers we\u2019d be able to turn it around directly and make sure it never happens again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about it so all we can do is move on and make sure the next game is right. We were pretty brutally honest in the review.\u201d\n\nNext up for Scotland are the big-hitting Samoans, who were reduced to 13 men for almost 10 minutes in the first half against Russia on Tuesday but still managed a six-try 34-9 bonus point victory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing everything in our power to put in a performance that the country can be proud of,\u201d Taylor said of Monday\u2019s game.\n\nScotland\u2019s number 10 Finn Russell was also at a loss to explain their abject display. Ireland were clinical and the Scots sloppy, he ventured, but there were moments in the match when if the ball bounced differently things could have changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine margins against the best teams in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable fans aren\u2019t happy. They know we can play better than this.\u201d\n\nWith very little ball to work with, Russell had minimal impact against the Irish and the Racing 92 standoff said it was key for Scotland to start better in their remaining group games against Samoa, Russia and hosts Japan.\n\n\u201cLooking on to the next three games, we have to make that a focal point for us, make sure we start well,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe players this week will be in the right place mentally and I believe we\u2019ll come out with a bit of fire in the belly.\u201d", "description": "Scotland are determined to make up for the meek, lifeless display that allowed Ireland to bully them from start to finish in their World Cup opener but despite a brutally honest review of their performance they still do not know what went wrong.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433739535&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0YZ", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
