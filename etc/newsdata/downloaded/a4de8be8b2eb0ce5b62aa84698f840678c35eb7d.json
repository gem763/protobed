Despite extensive searches across a huge area, her body has never been found.\n\nOn Monday her ex-partner Ben Lacomba was convicted of murder despite his attempts to evade justice. The 39-year-old showed no emotion as the guilty verdict was read out.\n\nLacomba's trial at Woolwich Crown Court heard that he killed Ms Wellgreen in a \"calculated manner designed to avoid detection, to leave no trace\" and to \"remove her from his life forever\".\n\nThe couple met online in 2004 but by the time of her disappearance their relationship was marked by \"tensions and problems\", the court heard.\n\nThey had split up but were still living under the same roof and it \"appears that potential loss of that family home, that property, and his children motivated his actions\", prosecutor Alison Morgan QC told the jury.\n\nIt took the jury three-and-a-half hours to reach its verdict. Lacomba is due to be sentenced at 10.15am on Nov 8 at Woolwich Crown Court.", "description": "The former lover of missing mother-of-five Sarah Wellgreen has been found guilty of murder, but has still not revealed what he did with her body.", "authors": ["Verity Bowman", "Norman Tebbit", "Asa Bennett", "Henry Smith", "John Longworth"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000214404461-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNTBpX4cGN5BnVIvJ0j4ciEb32xLDjffmx9SrriH-Ko8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
