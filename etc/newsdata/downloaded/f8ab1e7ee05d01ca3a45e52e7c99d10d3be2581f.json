Sign up here.\n\nAfter an Ohio sheriff\u2019s deputy left the courtroom Tuesday for a bathroom break, a man in his custody was suddenly hit with a series of electric shocks.\n\nThe Franklin County officer had accidentally dropped the remote control for the inmate\u2019s \u201cstun belt\u201d into the toilet. While drying the device, it accidentally and repeatedly shocked the David Wade, who was facing trial on charges of promoting prostitution, unlawful sexual contact with a minor, and promoting drugs, according to the Columbus Dispatch.\n\nThe 40-year-old was later cleared medically \u2014 the shocks went on for less than a minute \u2014 but the judge declared a mistrial, meaning his trial will happen again at a later date.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why deputies considered the \u201cstun belt\u201d necessary. The Franklin County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to a VICE News request for comment.\n\nThe electric shock devices \u2014 often fashioned as belts or ankle cuffs \u2014 can feel comparable to being Tased and often cause people to urinate or defecate on themselves. Amnesty International, a human rights organization, has called for the \u201ctorture\u201d devices to be banned. There\u2019s limited data available on how widely the devices are used and under what circumstances, but media reports indicate they\u2019re used in a variety of cases across the country.\n\nIn Ohio, for example, they\u2019ve been used during several murder trials. One of the state\u2019s death row inmates even filed a civil suit against a local manufacturer of electronic stun belts in 1997, claiming the belt prevented him from fully focusing on his trial.\n\nPolice claim the stun devices are useful because they prevent escape or violence, according to the New York Times.\n\nBut sometimes, the devices are blatantly used to exert power over an inmate. Last year, a Texas judge who repeatedly shocked a man to silence him during his own trial was reprimanded by an appeals court for violating the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nAs a result, the man\u2019s 2014 conviction was overturned. He had been charged with one count of soliciting sexual photographs of a 15-year-old girl online and sentenced to 60 years in prison.\n\nApart from the serious pain they inflict, civil rights advocates have argued that the stun belts alone make a defendant look guilty to a jury. In 2017, ACLU lawyers representing a death row inmate in Georgia said the stun belt had tainted their client\u2019s trial because he appeared anxious to the jury.\n\nThat same year, a federal appeals court threw out another man\u2019s death sentence because they said the \u201cstun belt\u201d had kept him from participating in his murder trial. Criminal defense attorneys have long said stun belts, belly chains, and shackles give the person an appearance of a criminal, even if they aren\u2019t one.\n\nCover image: Getty Images", "description": "His case was declared a mistrial.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db20665040663009245d13c/lede/1571950162997-GettyImages-972704346.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8484xh;0xw,0.1251xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
