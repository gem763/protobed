Genuine change for Eritreans has been limited: They remain isolated and under Mr. Isaias\u2019s iron fist despite the peace.\n\nBut the agreement has been held up as an example of how historic change can come about in even the oldest and most intractable conflicts. Diplomatic relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea have resumed, and the two leaders and senior officials from both nations have met frequently to discuss how to reconnect the two countries.\n\n\u201cPeace does not arise from the actions of one party alone,\u201d Ms. Reiss-Andersen said as she announced the award on Friday. \u201cWhen Prime Minister Abiy reached out his hand, President Afwerki grasped it, and helped to formalize the peace process between the two countries.\u201d\n\nTelecommunications between Ethiopia and Eritrea have been restored, allowing families that were split in the war to regain contact. In the days that followed this breakthrough, some Ethiopians called Eritrean numbers randomly, and vice versa, just to speak to someone on the other side, simply because they could. Others tracked down parents, siblings and friends.\n\nWhen the first commercial Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa to the Eritrean capital, Asmara, landed on July 18 last year, passengers stepping off the plane fell to their knees and kissed the ground. Two sisters separated from their father in the war, stuck on opposite sides of the border, embraced him for the first time after 20 years without him.", "description": "Mr. Abiy spearheaded a peace accord in his region and catalyzed reforms at home.", "authors": ["Matina Stevis-Gridneff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/world/11nobel-peace1/merlin_162408108_70353f9d-8148-43e5-be5e-0d630eaf359c-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
