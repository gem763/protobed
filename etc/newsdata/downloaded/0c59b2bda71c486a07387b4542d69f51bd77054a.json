Don\u2019t judge \u2013 in China, smoking was the healthy option.\n\nWage Slave's dentist says he's seeing a lot more patients plagued by anxiety. Erin Jonasson\n\nWhile complimenting me on my oral health, if not my life choices, he said plaque was not really a problem these days. The real problem, according to Dave, is chipped teeth caused by anxious wage slaves grinding away at their work stations while pretending to \u201ccrush it\u201d.\n\n\u201cI used to see only one or two cases of chipped teeth a year,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s three or four every month, and often it\u2019s younger people.\u201d After mentioning that he was off to Berlin for a month, David concluded that \u201cwork stress\u201d or \u201cjob anxiety\u201d was one cause of this newest of First-World problems.\n\nHe may be right. Australia\u2019s foremost expert in this field (OK, the only guy I know in the area), Professor Mark Wooden from Melbourne University, released a paper in April in which he largely concurred with David\u2019s thesis.", "description": "From the gig economy to climate anxiety, the stress of modern life is showing up in our teeth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/25011e6a777c8fb058a98ba3b753fc16b6c1e4f8", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
