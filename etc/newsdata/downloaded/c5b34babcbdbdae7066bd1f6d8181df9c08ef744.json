They are simply too cold, and you can't pick up any heat that might be coming from somebody hidden inside,\" they told The Mail Online.\n\n\"The smuggling gang must have known this, it just goes to show how clever they are. They are constantly looking for loopholes and sadly, it's ended up with all these people losing their lives.\"\n\nAnother security worker said the people inside the lorry \"never stood a chance\".\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar)\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nEven if the refrigerator had been turned off, they claimed, the airtight nature of the container would have suffocated anyone inside after a period of time.\n\nBoth members of staff said Purfleet did not have the resources to check every lorry that came through the port.\n\nRefrigerated units are rarely opened for fear the goods inside would be spoiled, they said.\n\nEach year 200,000 containers and the same amount of trailers and cars come through the port.\n\nIt is feared the 39 people who lost their lives decided to take on the incredibly risky journey with help from the Snakeheads, notorious people-smugglers with links to \u00adruthless Triad gangsters in China.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThey are said to tout the streets for victims, enticing them with the promise of a better life before charging thousands of pounds to take treacherous trips to the West in a \u201cfly-drive\u201d service costing \u00a330,000.\n\nThey are usually flown from the Fujian region of China to Europe, all expenses paid, then placed in accommodation. They are then placed in goods lorries and driven in darkness, without food, ventilation, water or toilet facilities.\n\nA source who cannot be named claimed migrants who make it to the West start paying back the Snakeheads the moment they get a job, over three years.\n\nIf they cannot pay, the gangs will put pressure on their families back in China to hand over the cash.\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nYesterday police began moving the bodies of the migrants from the lorry to a mortuary.\n\nOfficers are trying to find out if driver Mo Robinson, from \u00adPortadown, Co Armagh, knew the 39 were in the trailer being pulled by his Scania truck.\n\nHis parents, Mark, 50, and Nichola, are believed to have flown from Northern Ireland to support their son in England. Officers searched their modern semi-detached home in the nearby village of Laurelvale.\n\nThey also raided a \u00a3300,000 home in nearby Markethill, where it is believed the suspect lives with his pregnant girlfriend. A third property in the area was also searched.", "description": "Security guards at Purfleet in Essex have spoken of how people smugglers avoid detection and slip through the border", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Pa", "Press Association", "Humphrey Nemar", "Sky News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20721129.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mobile-scanner.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
